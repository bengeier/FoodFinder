{"text":"I LOVE THEIR FOOD! Oh my gosh, I have never had a better philly cheese steak in my life; but, it doesnt stop there, I also had a slice of my friend's pizza and it was out of this world! Everything is reasonably priced for the quality you're getting. It is extremely clean and the lady at the register made sure I was treated right. She checked up on us after a few bites to make sure we were satisfied. I am making this place my new Friday spot with my friends!  -props to the cooks in the back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! You name it, its tasty. The pizza sauce is flavorful, crust is really good suprisingly, the food is hot and fresh, fries are really good, and one of my most important things is the excellent service. The only thing I would have to encourage would be possibly adding another delivery driver or update your menus if there are times when you don't deliver. That's all."}
{"text":"Came in while I was waiting for the bus which is right next to the restaurant. I got a Philly sand which with fries and a drink.It was only like 8 bucks and had a great meal. 10/10 will come back"}
{"text":"New kabob spot! Love the service and cleanliness! Good food. Good times  conveniently close to dealerships and the DMV!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place at all. The woman at the front counter was strange. I ordered online for $8.87 but when I got there she charged me $9.15? I'm guessing they charge to grill the onions. I ordered a philly, but it just tasted like pizza. Very strange, and makes me think they're not clean."}
{"text":"I decided to come by after visiting the DMV and it is easily missed but im glad i found it. This place is like a little coffee shop that sells pizza."}
{"text":"This Cafe is next to the DMV. I want to the DMV on a Saturday and I can honestly say I got hungry since I didn't have breakfast or lunch. I was looking for something close by and I found this café and decided to go try it out. I was a little scared because the prices were very affordable I thought the food may taste bad. I'm so happy I decided to give it a try. The food was very good I had ordered the pizza, Garlic bread, and mozzarella sticks. I was there with my daughter and my fiancé. The pizza was nicely done in the mozzarella was nice and cheesy. I will recommend anyone to come here especially if you're waiting on the DMV. The café is very nice and small but not so small. The employees are very friendly and always there to help if you need any help. I also noticed that the café is very clean."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away between 2 car dealships, and can be missed easily. But it's worth finding. Quick delicious food for a reasonable price. Don't waste your lunch hour anywhere else. This place is legit."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood looking to buy a new BMW and stopped by at Newport Motors to do so. After a long day of test driving and negotiating deals I worked up quite the appetite and saw Newport Cafe right next door. Walked in and was immediately greeted by friendly smiles and wonderful service by the cashier Renee and the rest of the staff here. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak as it was recommended as a customer favorite and it did not disappoint! I was so pleased with this restaurant that I decided to get a pizza to go. Now I'm riding home in my new BMW with a delicious box of Newport Cafe pizza."}
{"text":"So was at the  DMV on sahara killing time and found this place attached to Newport Motors right across from DMV, man oh man their zuchini sticks are to die for, and $4.99 for cheese pizza! It is delish, plus why wait inside the DMV with a bunch of stinky people when i can be eating and watching tv"}
{"text":"Fabulous on every front... food, service, comfortable, quaint, and yes clean. A hidden gem. I will be back, and I will recommend the Newport Cafe to everyone I know... Bravo!"}
{"text":"$6.99 for a 12\" handmade supreme pizza!!! I'm in love!!!!! The restaurant was very clean. Brandon took my order and was very helpful and polite and he brought me pizza out to me when I was outside on the phone and went back for me Parmesan and chili. The only downside is there's no restrooms inside this establishment, you have to walk all the way over to Newport motors restroom."}
{"text":"Excellent food! My new favorite Greek cafe. Great services & atmosphere. Clean and quiet with full of good prices. Newport motors cafe the best."}
{"text":"My second time here and I absolutely love it. The first time I got a whole pizza and you can customize it with four toppings. The second time I got a chicken salad, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and cheese bread. It was very delicious. I would recommend going here if you are looking for affordable food that tastes amazing! You can also buy a new car next door."}
{"text":"The bread on this Philly Cheese Steak is so crispy and flakey. Tons of flavor without being a soggy mess. Will definitely come back when I'm in the area. Unfortunately it's far from home"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot $4.99 for a small pizza $5.99 for a Philly with everything well seasoned.  fries where hot and crisp.  Gyro is $4.99 on a soft pita everything comes out hot and fresh. Made to order.  You would never think a car dealership would have a good little cafe in their parking lot but I must tell you it's a great spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time  Cashier/server is great and so nice.  Food is fresh, I love it so much"}
{"text":"This place is awesome meatball sub is really good and the place is really clean and spotless it's so pretty inside as well and the cashier is very friendly and attentive will be coming back here when I'm this side of town"}
{"text":"I work at the dealership next door so i decided to check this spot out i placed an order for delivery and i open my box an first thing i notice was a strand of hair in between my cheese burger (Gross!) I still decided to try the burger after i removed the hair..bun was soggy and and burger was Ehh very bland same goes for the fries Def not worth the 8.95 cheeseburger and 1.95 fries ill pass next time."}
{"text":"This place is tucked off in a car dealership. Most good places are hidden. I finally decided to try a pizza and sub from Newport motors. The food gives you the feel of a good ol pizza joint that you would go to after school. Clean m, and friendly staff most of all fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Newport Cafe has the same price point as Little Caesars, but a delivers a far superior product. The restaurant is located next door to a small car dealership. It is squeaky clean inside and well decorated. Everyone was very courteous and friendly. If you are visiting the DMV on Sahara, then be sure to stop by and grab a tasty pizza for only $5."}
{"text":"As usual, this place is spotless! The server never stops cleaning. The food never disappoints. Great pizza for a tiny price. Five dollars. All the food is great and reasonably priced. Gyros, burgers, Philly cheese steak, large salads, $1 coffee, sandwiches, etc. This place is perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat especially when you're waiting around,very clean, friendly staff,love thier decor,love how you can see them make your pizza, it's all very good food"}
{"text":"Just waited till the cafe opened while getting my car serviced next door at Newport Motors. I have heard from the employees next door the philly cheese steak was really good, so I decided to give it a whirl despite my eating healthy spurt.  Can I just say, the place is so nice. Well decorated and CLEAN. You can eat off the floor. And I have never said that about any restaurant or even my own kitchen. Lol.  The philly came out and to my surprise it wasn't gooped with an insane amount of cheese. It looked healthy!! And for that matter it even tasted healthy! (Like is that even possible for a cheese steak?) well they did it and it was delicious!! I was pleasantly surprised how well made and perfect it was.   Staff is so nice and this little spot deserves a lot of recognition!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch as I work nearby and don't have a lot of choices. Great salads with fresh ingredients. The pizza is also really good and inexpensive. The fact that they deliver is a bonus and the staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"My one stop here was a satisfying dining experience.  Mozzarella Sticks were gooey but a little taffy like.  A thin 12-inch Ham & Cheese Pizza with extra ham and extra cheese was saucy, cheesy, and surprisingly good,  A Hero Sandwich with salami, turkey ham, and nicely melted Provolone Cheese inside a soft and warm hoagie roll was all hot and excellent, accompanied by lightly crispy Fries.  The small dining room is very casual, and there is no waiter service.  But this is a nice spot for lunch, especially so if your car is being serviced at one of the dealerships situated nearby.  XXX-1/2 stars overall!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, immaculately clean, modern interior, and the most amazing, welcoming and friendliest staff we've ever had the pleasure to meet!!! Eddie is always so attentive, accommodating and greets/ welcomes everyone like they are family. The cashiers are always so sweet and nice as well. Their food is fresh, made to order, gourmet food and comes in ample large quantities. I'm never able finish what I order because it's so much food for one combo. They really hook it up, you get the best value and bang for your buck. Very family oriented place to eat. They provide high chairs for the little ones. We love to dine there with the whole family."}
