{"text":"Have eaten here several times. Always get the garlic steak. It was always delicious. Today was a different story. So disappointing. The steak was chewy. They used a cheap cut of beef. It was definitely not the same quality and flavor that I was used to. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I really can't say enough amazing things about this place.  All their food is excellent and their customer service is always on point.  Meal prep was always my least favorite chore to do.  Now that I've found Fix8, the pressure it has lifted off of me and the time I have gained back in my life is priceless."}
{"text":"This was the worst 'service' I have ever had. I used UberEATS for delivery and driver could not find my house. I wrote note on delivery order, called and text driver. It took him so long and was very frustrating watching him take wrong turns through the ap. I told him left, he went right.  I understand this is not restaurant fault, well kind of, they can choose not to use them. Anyway, food came way too late and cold. Food was not very good anyway and will not go back!  When I called the restaurant a man told me he did not care and was very vulgar with colorful language, then hung up phone. I called back and someone else answered.  I asked for owner and he said he just stepped out and gave me his name of Steve Johnson. So Mr Johnson if you really are the owner you should know what is going on and who you have hired. Very very sad and what an unhappy little person you have on your staff. I will never come back and will let everyone I know not to patronize your business!   Shameful and all I wanted was to inform you of the poor Uber service."}
{"text":"My go-to!!! The food is fresh, clean, and delicious. I love that I can pop in and have a fresh meal after a workout of for a quick dinner. Thanks Fix8!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'll start from the moment we walked in and were stared at by a young female employee who never greeted us. I thought it may have been the first time she saw humans. Anyways, was given a recommendation on the place so I tried. Simply put, it's beyond basic food. The prep doesn't look fancy whatsoever. Taste is bland, could get more out of your own kitchen for $34. I've attached a picture of one of the three meals I ordered. Not the place for me, wish them luck."}
{"text":"Food always tastes amazing! My wife uses their meal prep service to stay on track while chasing out little one around. Always can count on these guys for healthy, tasty, and affordable food!"}
{"text":"Just ordered with UberEATS. The food was delivered in a timely manner and it was DELICIOUS! I had the steak and egg whites, hubby had the steak and chicken combo. Definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. My significant other and myself would eat here AT LEAST three times a week. I'm not sure if there has been a change of staff or management team or both but in the last month the customer service and the reliability of this WONDERFUL  place has gone completely in the opposite direction! The food is great aside from the occasional wrong item given or wrong flavor of steak but it's not a big deal to me because everything I order I love. My real issue is the fact that on their door there are hours and days that they are open, with any business its safe to go by days and hours.  Not here any longer I have come to this place at least 5 times and it has been closed for no explained reason. They used to be open 7 days a week that changed roughly 2 months ago with no explanation so now they are no longer open on Saturday which to me is crazy because in my mind I imagine Saturday would be the best day to be open. I knew they were closed this past Saturday so I went on Sunday and I was met with a closed fix8 once again. So this morning (Monday) I went there again and waited patiently in the car until 11:02am(they open at 11am) I see a worker come towards the door dancing and goofing around, so I and two other customers assume she is coming to open the door and flip the sign.. WRONG! She goes back to what she is doing which I don't know what is was honestly one customer left and the other customer and myself wait for 3-5 mins away from the door. He looks thru the window while I walk to my car, I see him knock on the door and point to the hours and the employees STILL don't open so he walks away. I waited in my car until 1115a to see if they were just waiting on him to walk away. They still weren't open at 1115a so I left. That was alot of profit for the business that the employees working Fed 19th @11am missed out on for no reason. Unfortunately this was the last straw this location has PERMANENTLY lost me as a reliable customer. The ONLY thing that sucks about this is this location was only 5 minutes away from where I live but I would rather drive the extra 20 minutes to the other fix8 if they are more reliable than this one."}
{"text":"An amazing place to eat after a great workout! Very impressed with the food and their prices, but above all, we received outstanding customer service from Vince and Amy, and we felt very welcomed! Definitely the new favorite place for my girlfriend and I."}
{"text":"10/10 best food around, I'm addicted to this place, the options are endless and its fast and friendly, I'd recommend the fish tacos(best I've ever had and I've had a lot of fish tacos!) garlic steak(superb flavor) or the tai penut with mushroom and a little saracha, really hits the spot and makes me feel food eating healthy! Don't forget your veggies"}
{"text":"I love Fix 8! Good, healthy food fast and cheap. I have been to both Henderson locations and the food is consistent but Vince at the Stephanie location and his customer service is absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended I try there food prep and I've loved everything I've had so far! Garlic steak is probably my favorite protein but I would recommend the BBQ chicken with sweet potatoes too!  My goal is now to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Ordered a few meals to~go. Everything was delicious! Will order from them again.The gal on the phone that took my order was very helpful. All the people were very friendly when i arrived to pick up my food."}
{"text":"Food is great. Meal prep orders are completed same day and are fresh and delicious. Service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Found the original location right before I moved out of Las Vegas and was excited to eat here again when I was in town for a short visit. I hadn't realized it was a completely different location and a vast difference from my prior experience. Not only is it not clean, not friendly, but food is not as good as it was before. I remember going into the original location and you really enjoyed the ambiance, service, and food. Food isn't totally bad but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is way too overpriced for what you get. I get it, healthy food isn't cheap. However, if I go to a place like this and pay $20 for a meal, I expect it to be original, tasty, and fresh. Not a prepacked salad from Albertsons, dried out brown rice, and reheated steak. I want freshly cooked food.  Also, if you're charging such high prices for reheated prepacked food, I suggest you don't charge a credit card fee. Your prices already overcompensate for the 30 cents you'll get charged for that transaction. Highly do not recommend."}
{"text":"We have eaten there 3 times and the food was always excellent ! The place needs to be finished inside but the kitchen is cooking really good food ! You can't go wrong with them!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Quality & generous portions & extra Friendly. Definitely be back several times a week"}
{"text":"Fix8 is helping me be a healthier eater!  Thanks to Fix8 opening just minutes from me, I am now able to get a great meal when I don't want to cook at home.  You chose from a wide variety of proteins, carbs and greens.    I have tasted several of their protein options.  My favorite is their Garlic steak.  It's tender with such a fulfilling flavor.  The 8 oz is almost too much with all of the brown rice they pack into your meal.  The mango salmon is good as well as the teriyaki chicken.  But nothing compared to the garlic steak.    A side salad comes with your meal.  You can opt to pay a few bucks more for various vegetable options. They offer broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms and spinach.    Another option is their pre-packed meals.  You can choose what you'd like in 6 or 9 meal portions.  They offer delivery on Tuesday and Saturday.   With friendly and quick service, I can see this becoming a favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped by couple weeks ago didn't realize they're open on Sundays which is awesome cause I was happy that I can get my post workout fix here. Last weekend I attended a body building competition and some of the competitors mentioned that they get their prep meals here! How cool! So today while I was at HI Coffee, I stopped in to say hello to their staff cause I'm a social butterfly like that, and whoa smells soo good in here.. I missed having garlic steaks! Happy to see Fix8 Fitness rockin it even more now! Love that there's also delivery and open on Sundays. Yay!"}
{"text":"I knew I would be out and about and not have time  to make dinner so I ordered online ahead of time. My order wasn't ready when I arrived but they gave me 6oz of chicken instead of the 4oz I ordered, plus extra veggies. That was very kindhearted!   The place was small and they had lots of orders being prepared and already prepared in the refrigerator. They also sold some protein bars and other snacks up front by the register.   I like the concept of the meal prep done by a cafe and it probably makes things a lot easier for some people but it wasn't my favorite. The grilled chicken and veggies had basically no seasoning and it was hard to eat, especially since I had no salt. The black beans were terrific! I mixed the chicken and veggies with the beans to add flavor. Next time I'll probably try one of the proteins with a sauce!"}
{"text":"I had a couple bad experiences at the Horizon location. But was finding it hard to stay away because when the food was good, it was really Good! So I stopped into the Stephanie location and spoke to the nice young man that was working. I explained my concerns and felt confident that he takes pride in the food he sends out the door. Well, I've ordered at least six meals and he hasn't disappointed me."}
{"text":"Can someone please pick up the phone. Or is the phone not working today ? Was going to do a large order .."}
{"text":"Food was delivered to my house unbelievably fast. I mean literally, I could not believe it was already here when it got here and was seriously considering the possibility there was some confusion. Worth the effort of hopping on here to write a review. they earned it! food was good too"}
{"text":"The food is OK but their service is horrible. The place is dirty and on organized. It shows the lack of healthy restaurants when a place like this can stay in business."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get 3 smoothies. There was one person waiting when I got to business. There was a sign on counter that said back in a few minutes. About 3 minutes later worker returned. He proceeded to take the first guys order, then my order and an order from a guy who came in behind me. As I sat there waiting a woman came in to get her to go order she had ordered online. The employee informed her he hadn't started the order yet. The guy in front of me received his cooked order, then the guy that had come in after me received his order about 10 minutes later. At this point it's been 25 minutes and I'm still waiting for 3 smoothies. When I finally received my smoothies after being skipped over it had been 35 minutes. I will say they were fantastic and food smelled delicious. After reading some of the reviews I believe the product is good, I think they just need to work on service a multitasking."}
{"text":"I like coming here because I try to have a cleaner diet and this place is close to my house/gym. Great customer service and super friendly staff. Highly recommend stopping by if you ever get the chance!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while we were in town for a rugby tournament as my daughter is very picky about what she eats between and after games.  The owner was very helpful, offering suggestions and packaging options.  Great food and portion sizes."}
{"text":"Love this place.  As a single person trying to keep things healthy, this place is amazing!  The meal preps are perfectly portioned and great for helping busy folks have a healthy meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is horrible!!! I ordered through grub hub and I ordered the mango salmon and strawberry salad. The second i got the bag it smelled like straight garbage!!! The mango salmon not only smelled like rank fish but it had pace picante salsa on top of it to hide the fish smell and the brown inside of it. It also had white slime all on the bottom of it. The strawberry salad had white slime as well and wilting spinach. Avocado on both the salad and salmon was rotten brown and the asparagus was a yellow brown as well. Manager would not refund my money and was a complete jerk! Good luck eating here this place is a complete dump!"}
{"text":"I had same experience as others, ordered online waited 45 min to get a call that the driver showed up and the business is closed, during their normal business hours.  This place has issues for whatever reason with being open during their regular posted hours.   I would call before you waste your time driving there, as its 50/50 shot if they will be open."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious recommend it 100%. I'm hooked. Service is strange to say the least. Seems like everyone moves at a turtles pace and you question the ordering process a bit. Also, we seem to go in there and there may be one other person in there at most but the tables aren't washed off."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place! I'm on a specific meal plan right now and I was able to make that meal! I got the 4oz chicken, sweet potatos, and broccoli plus a side salad. Hubby got a steak wrap. His wrap immediately fell apart. My food was great. Highly recommend for those on a meal plan."}
{"text":"Loved this place since their original location in deep Henderson. Now they are expanding along the 215 and this fabulous 2nd location. Friendly staff and easy to read menu makes the ordering process simple. Lots of options to substitute so you can never get board. The garlic steak is still my absolute favor protein but all the others are just as tasty (if steak is t your thang). Healthy eating has never been so affordable or THIS GOOD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I've been a customer at both locations since the Horizon store opened last year. The manager Dominick was very nice and informative about some of the items on the menu. Portion sizes are well worth the money and absolutely delicious. Usually chicken and rice sounds bland and boring, but Fix8 makes it just right. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good place with good service. 5 stars Fix8."}
{"text":"Don't order from here for delivery. it took over an hour to get it. the acai Bowl was melted the Poke was warm the iced tea was laying sideways in a bag leaking all over the place. a complete waste of a meal a complete waste of money. Beware complete lack of concern for the order or the customer."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. I got a steak wrap. It was mostly vegetables in the wrap. The side salad they give was a good size but too many veggies for me. The place was not really appealing and the kitchen looked pretty dirty. The owner was nice though."}
{"text":"Oh to top it off the owner responded and this is what he had to say....\"eat a bag of Dic*s!\" Wow like i said super unprofessional and inappropriate."}
{"text":"So we ordered the Thai peanut chicken and on the menu there is a picture of the plate with the mushrooms. The cashier Dominick said that you have to pay an extra dollar for the mushrooms. The menu is very misleading and he had no means of explaining this to me. I am big in customer service and the customer is always right. I felt that I was being mislead and lied to. I will never come back here just for the bad buisness practice and misleading information. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Had never heard of this place before but my husband and I were in the area and found it on Yelp.  It's very small with not much seating but the food didn't disappoint. My husband got the garlic steak and I got the steak and mushrooms--both came with a side salad of mixed greens and brown rice. The quality of the steak was good and it was well seasoned. I like that they had liquid aminos instead of soy sauce. Everything tastes good and was very healthy!!"}
{"text":"Fix8 Grill is in a great neighborhood to cater to all fitness and health conscious patrons.   Not only is it a made to order quick service restaurant, but they have lots of supplements, fitness drinks, proteins, and other products to carry out.   Considering this is a health/fitness grill, I was disappointed by the management/ownership who hired staff that are clearly not interested or knowledgeable in the health foods industry. (No fault of the daily staff, they were friendly & courteous)    It will be hard to make adequate choices in the supplements of food choices if the staff is unsure of its contents, nutritional values etc..."}
{"text":"Do not order from this location. I never received my order after 1.5 hrs. I asked for my order to be refunded but was told they could not do that and I had to contact Eat24. So no food and a charge on my credit card."}
{"text":"I stopped by for an early dinner while I was waiting for my car to be serviced next door.  I was wanting something healthy, so I was quite pleased to find this. I was immediately greeted. The menu had lots of options. I ordered the Thai chicken breast with green beans and mushrooms. It was so delicious.  I ate every last bite. What a great find!  Employees were super friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past few months and the food here is phenomenal but what impressed me even more was the service. I was attended by Loraina and even tho she was the only one working and it was really busy she kept her composure and handeled everyones orders in a calm and professional manner so grateful for your great service. Hope to see you again next visit."}
{"text":"I placed an order for 9 meals, after doing some quick math after Calling in the order I called back to cancel (less than 15 min later)  because I realized it was cheaper to buy the meals every day. The girl working the front said she cancelled my order but I was still charged $98. They disputed w my bank and got the money and I got none of the meals. I used to eat there all the time and now based on morals alone I will never be back.  SN: they said the food would be ready by 4pm the following day so it's not like they immediately started cooking it."}
{"text":"Don't ever order from this place for delivery on Yelp24. I heard someone honking their horn in front of my drive way, when I open the door driver yells out did you order food?  I walked up to him, he kindly informed me that he was an uber driver, not an uber eats driver and does not come to the door. He informed that this place must be scamming the system.  I grabbed my order and to my surprise ,when I unpacked my order the drink was missing. I do have to say the food was very good though."}
{"text":"Glad they moved out of Hendertuckey and in a convenient spot right off freeway. Love garlic steak, best entree.   Looks like they offer meal prep, might look into that option. Looks like they deliver too!  Guy behind counter handled himself well even though he was solo, phone kept ringing and three people walked in after me. He always had a smile - great job!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but can't love a place that doesn't answer the phone, called their other store to tell them about the problem with this locations phones. One week later still can't call my order in. Bad business. You just lost a few customers since this was for me and coworkers."}
{"text":"This place is honestly a disaster. The whole concept is a good idea, but the food is ridiculously overpriced and not good at all. Up until a few weeks ago, I would have honestly reviewed Fix8 at three stars, but I ended up walking in early before noon even on a weekday, and I did not even get a \"hello\" or \"I apologize for...\", the girl working looked like she was in her pajamas and was by herself, and goes \"Hey yeah, we have a huge order to do, so I can't get to you for like 40 minutes, so yeah, you can wait.\" I was of course pretty surprised, and I obviously walked right out. Pretty sad, since this place was not terrible until I experienced this. Really embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a few times to grab a healthy lunch or dinner. On my most recent visit I noticed that a few things have changed for the better with the menu. Meals previously came with two set sides of rice and greens, but now sides are chose from a large list of options.  Fix8 seems to specialize in meal prep, but does offer individual meals to enjoy there or grab on the go. I don't mind doing my own meal planning and preparation so this isn't a service that I'll probably ever use.   The inside of the restaurant is simple. There are a couple of tables and no décor. Several shelves of nutritional products line the front corner of the restaurant.   Meals are ordered by the ounces of protein and then include two sides. There is a large list of sides to choose from including potatoes, salad, rice, vegetables, etc. They have a large variety of protein options including chicken, steak, fish, and tofu.  I went with nine ounces of the Garlic Steak with sweet potatoes and grilled mushrooms. This meal comes in at $16.99 which I thought was pricey. I went with the larger portion so I could make two meals of it and justify the cost a bit. I've ordered this steak every time I've stopped here and it wasn't that great this time. It was a little tough and not very flavorful. The potatoes were plain and don't have any seasoning. The grilled mushrooms were fine. My meal wasn't bad, but it wasn't flavorful either. Restaurants like this appeal to me because my hope is that they can make healthy food taste better than I can at home.   Overall, this spot is good if you are in a hurry or feeling lazy and need a healthy meal."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. Ordered the chicken fajita and it was VERY salty!!! The cook said he just worked there and said the owner doesn't allow him to prep the food. He then suggested the BBQ sauce for the chicken which was also VERY salty!! The place smelled like a men's restroom which was a turnoff. In the end, we had a stir fry chicken and veggies which was less salty but still salty and everything was slightly overpriced. Could have had a healthier meal at home or somewhere else. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I've visited this spot twice in the past week... as most other reviews note, the initial impression is somewhat positive--good, clean food. But, ultimately, I have too many frustrations to continue eating here... prices are very high given what you are actually getting even considering convenience; there's a card use surcharge; the decor is not only unimpressive, the tables and chairs are beat up and wobbly; they were out of Cholula my first visit and then also were out of Tapatio my second time--all other options either have soy or added sugars (not so healthy); the staff doesn't seem conscientious--no \"thanks for your business\" nor show of concern for being out of something... maybe say \"We will order some more of that. Thanks for letting us know!\"; the staff also doesn't really know what ingredients are in some of the things they serve... I imagine a lot of special diets come into a spot like this given you are meant to be able to get clean eats, but when I asked about a salad dressing I received the response \"it comes from a bottle.\" So there's that... We ended up having to go home for hot sauce and salad dressing, so the convenience was lost and the nearly $40 spent on two steak/chicken combos was far from worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped in on sat jan 28 about 430. I've seen their sign but never had time to stop. I'm so glad I did this time. The customer service is exceptional and the food is fantastic. The chef was so nice and took the time to explain the menu to me and offer suggestions. I had the Thai peanut chicken and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked. It's  hard to find a place that makes healthy food that's also fast and fresh. I'll be there once a week if not more. Support our local business'! Try them out! You'll be happy u did!"}
{"text":"great place to get a healthier meal! they also do meal prep and delivery which is really convenient. staff is super nice and fast making your food! try the thai peanut chicken."}
{"text":"The food is good but that's where it ends.The staff are not efficient and the service is mediocre. I've waited way too long for my order on a week night, with  the staff not acknowledging my wait or giving me an update. I even witnessed a customer walk in and order minutes after I ordered and receive their food first.   The menu was down on the tv the day I visited, and the printed menus don't even adequately display the choices (like their 6 oz meat option).   The prices are way too high, and everything is an expensive add on. 2 bucks to add in zucchini? When they charged me 50 cents to use my debit card that's when I decided this place lost my business for good, out of principle alone. You're charging me to receive money straight out of my checking account? With how much you charge to add on a cheap vegetable? That's greedy of you. I think you can afford to eat the processing fee.  I signed up for their text coupons on my last visit. The door had a sign to do it. The guy who rang me up looked at my phone like he had no clue what I was showing him, and like he'd never seen it before.   I can't believe they'd call themselves a healthy food cafe when they aren't even allergy-friendly. I told them that one of our dishes was for a soy allergy and they put it in the same bag as another dish with teriyaki sauce, which was dripping into the bag.   Nickel and dime pricing structure and a complacent young staff make this a no go for me, despite it being right around the corner."}
{"text":"Great place for meal prep or simply eat healthy on the go. I love all their food and customer service a great!! I would Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have come here several times. Great fresh food, attentive and friendly service. Perfect for a healthy feed or daily meal prep."}
{"text":"Awesome place with good and healthy food for those who need their protein fix.  Great customer service by Amy!"}
{"text":"Well first time ordering for meal prep. Ordered on Thursday. Prepaid. Even talked to them. Open 7 days. Go to pick up today and no one there. I'm pissed. I didn't order from the one I usually use. Wanted to try something different. They better refund me. Girl standing outside said they are unreliable. Owner lives out of town. Never open when the sign says. Wow. Bad bad bad first visit.   So update. As of today still no refund. I texted the guy and no reply. I attached a picture of his message to me calling me an asshole with his excuse of being hit by a drunk driver, which also happened to be on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the history of this place not following their hours that are posted. So kinda don't  believe him especially with his reaction. Don't think he's big on customer service!! Looking at all the other reviews for this place someone called him a hothead. So don't plan on ever being able to criticize the food, if you're in person he might punch you!! He might be off his meds. I predict out of business in about a month if not sooner. He's got a deal with some gym close by. Maybe they should know about this??!! Just unbelievable to me."}
{"text":"Now closer to where I live! Might be a problem for me. Just opened 9/26. I picked up dinner and lunch for work yesterday. Salmon tacos w salad. Lunch I got brown rice with garlic steak. Comes with a side salad. Quick and easy. Great quality. Meal prep available and they deliver too."}
{"text":"I went there two times and they where closed for some weird reason.  So I wonder about a place that makes its own hours rather then follow the hours it has posted.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fail. Website and large exterior signs advertised OPEN on Sunday 11AM to 8PM.  Visited on Sunday oct 1st at 11:30- store completely closed. Utter fail as we live less than a mile away, not sure if we'll make it back. Gave our business to another lunch place."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but watched my husband eat his chicken salad. But I wouldn't eat here because the bathrooms and the storage area to the restrooms were filthy.  Grossed me out. If my restrooms were that dirty in my restaurants, my customers would be calling the 1(800) line. The cashier/cook was very nice, that's why 3 stars."}
