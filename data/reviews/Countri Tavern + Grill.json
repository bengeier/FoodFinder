{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service was terrific.  The menu is comprised of typical Wisc. fare and they have decent selection on the children's menu.  We just had sandwiches that were good and my son had pizza which was also good.  There diner selections seemed a bit pricey and I will have to go there a few times to see if they are worth it."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this restaurant before they opened.  I really want this restaurant to be my frequent dining establishment.  My family and I have eaten in the dining room four times and outside once.  I've entertained coworkers in the bar for happy hour three times.    The food and environment is the best in area.  Unfortunately, the service matches every other less expensive place including the previous Broux House.  We sat at a table for 20 minutes without being served, charged for kid drinks, no apologies for mistakes, waited for open tables, received meals at separate times, a manager that didn't care, everyone seems unhappy, etc.    At least the bartenders are good!  $1 happy hour beers put the third star on my rating and keeps me coming back...for now."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Stoughton before and was taken to Countri by our hosts.  I really enjoyed the visit.  1.  ATMOSPHERE.  It's got a modern rural feel going with lots of wrought iron decorations inside a cavernous (and yes, loud) main room.    2.  MENU.  This place had a ton of options.  They had fried chicken, cheese curds, a long sandwich lists and a great selection of salads.  3.  SALAD.  I had the Southwest salad which was really good.  4.  FRIED CHICKEN.  My colleague had the fried chicken which looked delicious.  All in all a great restaurant and I hope to have the opportunity to return."}
