{"text":"Roma Catering has new digs in the NE. They've been around for ages and offer consistently decent food for a reasonable price. There was a groupon which I took advantage of, $12 for $20 worth of food and I came away with Chicken Parmigiana and Chicken Saltimbocca. The Parmigiana came with the requisite grilled veggies. The portion of chicken was HUGE, the veggies a little sparse, on the whole a solid parmigiana. The Chicken Saltimbocca was ok, the chicken was cooked perfectly, moist and lightly seasoned. The focaccia was a little over baked and then toasted for the sandwich so ended up having a bit too thick of a hard crust but otherwise fine. All in all the Saltimbocca was uninteresting. I also sampled the soup of the day - roasted red pepper, rich and creamy, nice, $4. The tomato bocconcini was nicely marinated and subtly flavoured, I could taste the fresh basil used and there was a good complement of tomatoes to cheese. 8 oz container was $4. Both soup and salad are decent. They also have started a special 1st Wednesday of the month feature, next month will feature a prime rib with fixings for $16. The one thing I observed was the bit of confusion with how things are done, as you enter the service counter is to your right, the cashier at the end closest to you but there is a sign at the other end to order there, the chef was behind the counter taking orders and so was the girl at the cash who seemed new as she wasn't quite sure of prices or which end to put the order ticket for the chef to fill, there is one other gentleman also jumping in and it seemed that he was filling orders as well, they just need to get into a rhythm of working together but service is pleasant and fairly quick. There are coolers with self-serve cans of pops and other drinks as well as some dessert and a hot food display where there is pizza and the hot entree special of the day. There is parking in a private lot and I got there about 11:30 in the morning just before the lunch rush and there was a constant stream of people coming in as I was leaving. There are tables if you choose to eat in. The decor is simple and charming."}

{"text":"Roma was awesome to work with. We had them cater our wedding and I couldn't be happier. They were fantastic to work with, willing to work within our budget, great at accommodating any special dietary needs.   There service was fantastic on the day of, very quick and professional. We had beef as one of our dinner options and some of our guests had mention it was one of the best steaks they've ever had.   I couldn't recommend their catering service more!"}
