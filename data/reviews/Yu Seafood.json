{"text":"Only been here for dim sum. Modern and newly renovated place. There are rooms for large parties. Service was good since one of us knew one of the managers here.   However, their food are just mediocre. Their dim sum, I would say were no different from any other dim sum restaurant out there. The server recommended a few of their specialty dishes, but I don't recall any of them to be outstanding. Their signature dessert 'Napoleon' was just layers of pastry, fresh cream and fruits piled together without any skill or heart.   In Richmond Hill, if your food is not outstanding, your price better be. But that's not the case here either."}

There are no English menu and all menus are only in chinese  We asked and the reception brushed us off and told us only Chinese Maybe a language problem but. If they don't have an English menu and will not help out a English speaking person all I can say is     F U"}
{"text":"Unfortunately they did the worst service to my dum sum lunch. ..The day after backed from China, HK and Japan for one and half month trip, I was so exited to have a lunch at Yu restaurant. Since their fish mart is very high quality in GTA, who gonna doubt its food quality. We order a plain congee and several dim sum. It was a busy Sunday lunch time so most of table is occupied by the family with small children. Then big surprise. There was a chunk of metal sponge in the congee. I was busy in chatting so almost swallow the piece of metal if my family did not stop my spoon.  We called restaurant manager immediately. And another surprise. He grabbed the congee plate quickly and said ' oh, cancel it' and left our table without apology nor follow up. We asked him again what happened inside the food but he kept saying that today is my last day (so what ?) I can't do anything. !!!! After that I do not remember what I ate. The new manager came and said sorry to us. However, I have a trauma now. Just imagine what happened in the kitchen. Hygiene management is the basic of restaurant business. No matter how they cook fancy dim sum, I may not go back there again. It's a metal contained dim sum not edible at all."}
{"text":"Yu seafood seems perfect for any small groups of foodies who like to take snapshots of the food to boast about on socia media or perhaps for special occasions amongst friends and family.   I came for dim sum over a weekend and managed to sample an array of their offerings. It is very apparent that they have put a lot of effort into the presentation of each dish and tried hard to make each one colourful and stand out. They have succeeded in this respect as it does all look impressive and adds to the attractiveness of the food. However we all know not to 'judge a book by its cover'. The food is decent enough but does not quite live up to its appearance. Oftentimes ingredients seem to have been added more to 'beef up' the look or name of the dish rather than to complement said dish. For example, dried abalone or bitter melon added to the bottom of a beef ball doesn't seem to help the overall taste, sweetcorn seems to be added to many things as if as an afterthought, and the black and yellow colouring of the yolk bun may look exotic but adds nothing to the flavour of the bun so is merely for decorative purposes.   Furthermore the dishes that we may expect to come with dip e.g. Worcester sauce in traditional Chinese dim sum or soy sauce with Cheung fun were not provided. Frankly the service from many of the waiters and even the supervisor left somewhat to be desired.   If Yu Seafood was a person, they would be photogenic and have great make up, fashion sense, and come across as slightly overconfident. Dig a little deeper and you may find them a little shallow and superficial."}
{"text":"We came here for a Xmas family dinner   My sister suggested to order a meal for 2 and add more dishes   We ended up spending $550 for a group of 5 with large plate of crab legs, stir fried crab, veggie , fried rice , plus the additional order of sea urchin and sashimi.  The crab was huge to look and we paid more because of the size we cannot choose ( about $100 more )  We finished all the food as the crab came out not as big. The crab shell with the roe disappear and not showing in the fried rice, we wait for an hour to have that !  The fruit plate looks very weak ( looks like left over fruit salad with a few graphs and badly cut orange and pineapple ) as compare to the other dishes in the restaurant, which reminds me the restaurant team is from mainland . Ha , at least they tried to be grand but small details shows the truth.  I found the focus of the meal is the crab, the rest is just weaken the overall experience.  The dessert is also a joke. They asked us to wait as they said the chef would make the dessert for the many groups each time. So that's a mainland idea of communist meal . Haha . I did not know I went to a mainland Chinese set up until the very end of the meal.    My sister had a very bad stomach and ran to the bathroom after an hour . My brother in law said that the sea urchin has turned bad, he found the taste is a bit strange.  The sushi session is not run by Japanese and I cannot expect safety and quality level in eating a sea urchin with the shell."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's day dinner, but received very bad service. Staffs were rude and poorly trained. Considering the quality of food was about OK (actually the food from competitors have better taste), a $500 combo for five ppl was just over priced. Overall it's just not worth it. Won't go again."}
{"text":"For dinner it's really pricey and not honest. The server will so push you for pricey food, but in bad manners. We ordered a king crab combo for two,at price 238. End up the bill is 380 because there are extra half pound price not included in the combo price,without notice and there it is. The king crab is over cook. Food quality is OK but not impressed. And the combo for two is actually portion for more than three adults."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dimsum.  First of all the interior design is spectacular.  The intricacy of every detail was spot on....minus the plates.  I think the prices are set so high to help pay for the renovations, lol.  I heard through the grapevine how much reno costs were...not surprised.  The service was quick and attentive, but the food was mediocre.  Nothing truly sets them apart compared to a push cart dimsum restaurant.  For example, they served hargow, but it came with Thai sweet chili sauce and two extra pieces of shrimp, veerrrry fancy.  We also ordered the squid tentacles, or rather shoe soles.  Their Saving grace was their bbq pork buns with the crispy topping (just bc its a fav for me) and the passion flaky tower (which was more eye candy than   3 stars for the decor, -2 for ordinary, lack luster food"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dim sum last week for the first time. The decor was very nice and it is evident that effort is put forth to make this place \"classy and upscale\".  That being said, you do get a feel that it is not the usual dim sum digs. The decor is modern and attractive, though where we were seated was rather chilly! There is a nice reception area where the host greets you. I made a reservation in advance and so no waiting was required. For some reason, they automatically speak to you in Mandarin. I had to tell them in English, that I don't speak Mandarin but then I added, in na√Øve hopefulness that I can speak Cantonese though! They proceeded in Mandarin with me and lead us to our table. The food was ok, not exceptional but not too bad. The thing that made me want to write a review was the attempt at being high end but neglecting that what goes with that is customer service! The service was meh at best. In fact, the most off-puting was when a dim sum lady brought our dim sum to our table. She had a tray of a few more dishes but was obvious that there was room on her tray. I politely asked her in Cantonese if she would be able to take an empty dish for me. She responded very curtly, \"Of course I cannot! Can't you see I have little space?!\"  I felt like I was scolded by this lady! Is this the kind of service you'd expect? Wasn't there a less crass way to respond? Management needs to train ALL their staff if they want to provide \"upscale dining experience\". Like most Chinese establishments, initial efforts are there but attempt to try and stand out as \"upscale\" is futile. It will soon be another run-of-the mill York Region Chinese restaurant. Won't be much to write home about."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad services.....waitress and servers always pull their long face, never ask how's your dishes doing.  They said only accept cash and debt cards when I pay for the bill, even their menu said accept credit cards.  Maybe they can avoid paying tax to the Government.   Shark fins soup dumpling is the worse dim sum dish, no shark fins inside, avoid to order it. Tastes so so compare to other restaurants at Highway 7."}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum on weekday, got a table for four right away. There weren't too many options for dimsum as the options for steamed dimsum were quite limited..but they had a fried noodle/rice section and chefs special. We had their Kidney Bean fried noodle which tasted pretty good. However-The steamed dimsum didn't live up to the interior decoration..it was rather mediocre. I cant say for the quality of dinner as I haven't tried it yet. But i did see other tables ordering lobsters and other seafood for lunch. Service was pretty good. I wouldn't come back for dimsum again as there many more dimsum places that offer better selection."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum for the very first time today at Yu Seafood.   Despite the negative reviews I decided to go in with an open mind.   I'm so glad I did!   Everything from the service to the atmosphere to the food was exceptional.  I've had a lot of dim sum and this ranks extremely high among the places I've tried.  The icing on the cake was the discovery of an adjoining seafood market where you can buy sashimi grade fish!!   Uni from Japan??  Yesss!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience!  I ordered set menu for 5 people ($328), but we had party of 6.  So they made us pay extra $12.50 for that extra person.  The food was not for individual portions. It was served on a large bowls and plates.  So it's unfair that they charged extra.   The lobster and the king crab was showed to us in advance prior to cooking, but no one mentioned that it was over weight. So they charged extra which we were not aware of until I received my receipt.   Also, the cork fee is $15 per bottle!!!!! That's too expensive!  The restaurant is nicely decorated but completely under staffed.  I waited at least an hour for my water/tea.   I would not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great taste! On a side note, service could be a little bit better.  I came here with a couple of friends during dim sum service on a weekday. The hostess brought us to our seats 8 and politely told us to order through the server. We called the server numerous times but she did not respond. I feel like she could have paid more attention to us rather than setting up new tables.   However, the food made up for the service. The har gow was amazing and tasted freshly made on the spot! I also really enjoyed the beef cubes as it was the first time that i`ve seen a dim sum menu with that sort of item! IT WAS DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Update - Yu offered me 4lb lobster on the house which is about 10% of our bill... it's a nice gesture and I appreciate Yu for trying to make it right, but i'm not going back.  They don't need me as a customer and I'm sure the restaurant will do fine with all that mainland money rolling in!   **  Mother Day's dinner;  The service was atrocious, and I still tipped 15%, a bill totaling $830 dollars for six people.  We couldn't get anybody to take our order!  Had to raise our voice to get any attention.   The \"premium soup\" came for the first course, and nobody came to serve the soup.  Even at cheap-arse Chinese restaurant they come and serve the soup in the small bowls for you. Fine, so be it, I got off my arse, and ladled the soup for my family........ ( it was my pleasure)  We ordered the set King Crap and Lobster for 7 even though we were 6 people. They come and say there will be an upcharge because the weight% was over.... oldest trick in the book to get you to spend a bit more money. It's fine I didn't complain, it was mothers day!! I don't want to ruin a special day over another 60 bux.  In terms of the food.  It's decent food but to be honest after the first couple bites on the lobster everything tastes the same with all that garlic, chili, and salt they put in.  I don't think the crab and lobster preparations are any better than any other Chinese seafood joints (Omei, Fishermen' Lobster  Clubhouse, etc) but that's obviously subjective to taste.  However their lobster poo fried rice is a bit of a letdown compared to the other places!  Not enough poo (Tomalley) in the damn rice and you know that poo aint coming from the lobster they just slaughtered and you paid for!!!They probably using a stock poo countainer to pump that crap out.   ......... oh btw they forgot to bring the poo fried rice out for us, we had to ask them, and wait another 20 minutes...... we were already almost two hours into our dinner.    I guess Yu's was just watching out for us... Health Canada says not to eat too much lobster poo (tomalley) !  http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2013/33625a-eng.php  So, you know only real ballers eat here because they don't credit card so no room for posers which is fine with me, tired of these pretenders riding beemers and still living with their mommy at home because they are having mothers day dinner every night I guess!! Lastly I finally figured it out where  you're paying the premium.  Just 'dabao' your shizz home, and they pack it in nice fancy containers.  Maybe if they use the cheapass containers, they can pass the savings to the consumer.  Bottom line..... terrible service, despite my sister raving how this place had better service than most Chinese joins!  Save your self a couple hundos, and eat the same food at the other seafood joints.  Cheers Joe"}
{"text":"Our party ordered and enjoyed the king crab legs and the 8 lb lobster, all of which were beautifully presented and really good. We also had several appetizers, all of which we also really enjoyed. The food here is excellent. However the service is abysmal. Our table was laden down with used dirty dishes, with staff making no attempt to clean up for us. We continually had to ask for old plates to be removed. In fact we had to clear items ourselves. Service was just plain non-existent."}
{"text":"Overall Impressions: 4.5 for quality food, presentation, service and ambience. I will keep coming back for dim sum and the occasional dinner. Been here over four times for dim sum and dinner so far.   Tips: You're better off making reservations because the lineups can get intense during peak dim sum hours.   Food: I enjoyed their selection of dim sum. Dinner was good as well. Their food quality was consistent and presentation is excellent. They tend to serve fusion style (some Japanese elements at times) with large plates. It's also reminiscent of the local Dragon Boat dim sum restaurant in terms of presentation of food. I've tried their seafood chow mein (large servings of tiger prawn), glass noodles and fried rice as well. I was not disappointed.  Their dinner portions were nice. Their piled high fried lobster with garlic is exactly what I've come to expect; after being a veteran at the various \"fisherman's\" variations restaurants scattered across Markham.   Service: I've been impressed by their service each time I went. Promptly served tea and staff were attentive to my needs, especially considering how busy the restaurant can get. Ambience is wonderful and the restaurant is very nicely renovated. Seating in the booths can be a bit tight and table space is limited especially because of their awkwardly large plates. Luckily the servers were cognizant of this and promptly switched our food onto smaller plates to accommodate more food.   Parking: Can be difficult and to save myself the hassle of fighting for spots, sometimes I'll park across the street by the bank and walk over."}
{"text":"Reply message to Yuseafood - Aug 3,2016 Alison, Thank you very much for your comments. I appreciate you for taking the time to reply to me. You indicated that you have sent me a private message with contact info for resolving the issues; however, I haven't received it. Would appreciate if you can resend it. Thank you very much.  Irene  Original review: Went to Yuseafood for dim sum lunch on a long weekend after reading good reviews. We enjoyed the lunch and thus we decided to come back for dinner. Overall, we found that the decor was appealing, food was of good quality but the service was not up to the standard of an upscale restaurant.   We enjoyed the dim sum lunch as the quality and the presentation were good. It was the good experience at lunch that brought us back for dinner. We ordered the combo dinner with shark fin soup, oyster, sea cucumber, goose web, turbot fish and etc. We chose this combo mainly due to the turbot fish. We enjoyed the first few dishes and then we started feeling the pressure of finishing the food quickly. One server even attempted to remove my plate while I was eating. When I told her that I was still eating, she just went away. I was astonished by her act as it is a simple courteous manner expected to be observed by servers even in a smaller restaurant. Another disappointing moment was the serving of Turbot fish. We thought it was steamed as it has always been the way we had it before elsewhere but it was fried.  We asked the server for clarification and he became very offensive and talked to us as if we had never had Turbot fish before. Also, we found the servers were generally hardworking but somehow they looked fairly stressful.   All in all, we had high expectation of Yu seafood given the price they are charging but our dinner experience was unpleasant and we couldn't enjoy the food and decor in such condition. We don't really have the desire of returning no matter how amazing the food and decor are."}
{"text":"Came to have dim sum lunch  Pros:  Interior looks very nice, above average than competition in the area  Food is also very delicious and of high quality, with refreshing presentation   Cons:  The place is a little small, be prepared to wait  Most staff not well trained, a big mismatch to hardware and food  Overall:  Worth coming, but a truly high end experience requires truly professional services"}
{"text":"Place, Cleanliness and Food are great. Service is OK. Price is fair.  Every dim sum dish comes in a giant heavy plate while most tables are small in general. Does it mean you either have to eat fast to clean up the table or it doesn't want customers order too much food at the same time.  With so many exits and hidden entrance, it is like a maze when you got in and you don't know where the washroom and the way out when you are done.  One bad thing is you cannot find parking spots easily within such a \"mall\" with so many restaurants, retail stores and bank."}
{"text":"I took my parents for dim sum lunch after reading some positive reviews.  Checked the menu online beforehand so I knew that I would be paying a premium which I did not mind if the dining experience warrant it.  I would agree it is not your average Chinese dim sum resto.  Fine dining decor & atmosphere - the severs were attentive & polite.  The food presentation & taste was top notch.  However, I do have one issue here - how can you really be taken seriously as an upscale, fine dining restaurant in a major metropolitan city and not accept VISA, M/C or AMEX?  Instead, along with cash or debit card, they accept \"China Union Pay\" as a form of payment - a bit odd I must say."}
{"text":"My wife and I recommended Yu Seafood to our family for dinner. Boy was it a letdown, and embarassing. We were a table for 6. Service was great as our server was very lively and had a great sense of humour. Food on the other hand was a let down.  We ordered the Lobster & Dungeness Crab combo.   1. Premium Shark Fin Soup with Lobster - Half the table found it too salty and rinsed their palette with either beer or water.  2. Stir Fried Lobster with Garlic - It was actually two lobsters that added up to 8lbs. But one of the lobster was obviously not fresh. As the meat was not plump and juicy. It was dry and glued to the shell.  3. Stir Fried Dungeness Crab - Exactly the same as the lobster. Two crabs that added up to 5lbs. One was clearly not fresh (probably dead). Meat was dried up and stuck to the shell. It was like a 50/50 draw, not knowing if you chose a dead or fresh crab to your plate. Very disappointing. No one at the table actually wanted to finish the crab.   4. Deep Fried Lionfish - Another dish that was an utter disappointment. Meat was not juicy at all. It was a bit rough and dry. Deep frying it didn't make it any better.   Everything else on the menu was good - steamed eel, oyster, pea sprout braised in broth, shark fin with rice, and dessert.  But when we ordered this combo, we expected the stars of the combo, namely lobster and dungeness crab, to shine. Neither one shone.   Not sure if they changed owners. Or if there's a new chef in town. But for the price we paid that night, there are about 3-4 other options in the area. Family won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"HORRIFIC service and everyone was consistently unprofessional.  Go if you want you pay and be treated like crap. Sashimi (raw fish) + hot soup + hot lobster claw + hot appetizer all came at once.  They would have served the rest at the same time if we didn't complain.  C'mon don't treat people like pigs.  They could careless about returning customers but NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Honestly, the decor is beautiful (especially for a Chinese restaurant) and the food was scrumptious. I'm not a seafood expert so I wouldn't know if it was top-notch, fresh-off-the-boat fish,  but the dishes were really good! Service wasn't too bad (again, especially for a Chinese restaurant) and the prices aren't too crazy! Would go here again for sure!  Probably only for special occasions though when we're willing to splurge a little."}
{"text":"too pricey for the quality of food, very nice decor, the service is A+, a limited choice on the menu other than set meal, dim sum is good."}
{"text":"The manager told us that the restaurant is still in testing phase. So this is just a soft opening and is not officially in full operations yet. We went for dim sum at 9:30am on January 2, so it wasn't too busy (about 10-15% full). Even with a toddler, they gave us a table tucked in, and it wasn't that spacious. Many of their tables are circular booths, so there wasn't a lot of options.   The flavour of their food was quite on point. They paid attention to the details for each dish, for example, they are accompanied by a \"side\", the plating is pretty fancy, and they use pretty large plates, which made for a crowded table."}
{"text":"If there is a way I could give them a -10 star, I would. I'm not writing this review based on the food because I wouldn't know since I had to walk out after 10 minutes of sitting down. Right off the bat, we were given attitude from the start and was rushed 5 times by wait staff to order (we had sat down for less than 5 minutes). We were given one menu for our table of 7. Why are they in a rush when the entire restaurant is half empty??? When we ordered, the waitress gave us such condescending attitude for not ordering quickly that we had to walk out, I was nice enough to leave $10 for our un-drank tea when I shouldn't have given them a penny for their attitude."}
{"text":"Good tastes overall.  I have tried both dim sum and lobster there. I'd say there are better dim sum places nearby. Pork ribs with pumpkin is NOT recommended. Egg yolk bun is yummy.  Good option for seafoods. However, both noodles and congee are served in one combo."}
{"text":"Delicious food high class restaurant nice decoration but service  needs to improve a bit to match the rating"}
{"text":"Food was great! Everything was a bit more fancy than expected. The service was very nice. They constantly cleared the table and refilled water for tea."}
{"text":"Have to admit, impressive decor the moment I arrived. I have been there twice for dim sum and once for dinner.  Dim sum - you will soon realize that the choices are very limited, about less than half of the choices you would get at a typical dim sum place. The reason why? They want you to order from the other page of the menu, which range from $15 plus for veggies, bbq ribs etc. the worst part about it, the servers constantly try to up sell you will already prepared crabs or lobsters. I am here for dim sum, not the leftover seafood from last night. The idea is that they lure you in for lunch and hopefully you will come back for dinner which can cost $100 per head. Get it?  Dinner - was there on a weeknight. They place was less than half full. Order the usual seafood stuff. Unfortunately, because the lobster was over 8lbs, the claws were uncooked from the inside. I did get an apology and explanation that sometimes it is too difficult to cook a giant lobster etc... So get this... They only took away the claws and the server said, let me microwave it for you. Honest, no joke.   That was the last time I went there. I got invited to go there from friends and each time I just said \"not worth it\". You try it once and realize you can get the same food if not better for way cheaper."}
{"text":"Arrived at 1pm for a Monday din sum lunch. The room was full, and we were told there was a 10-15 min wait. We were seated before the 10 min was up, and were welcomed into a lovely dining room. Staff were friendly and efficient. We ordered the standard charcoal  bun, shrimp shumai, chicken feet, sticky rice with duck egg, stick rice with roast pork, and some pickles. All was delicious. The sticky rice with duck egg was particularly memorable. As several people have noted, the charcoal bun is very photogenic. The bun itself has an mildly unusual charcoal flavour, which I found tasty. The filling is delicious.  Fun spot. Will come back for a proper meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with my family. First impressions of the place was quite nice...the renovations are modern and clean.  However, the dim sum selection was quite limited. They have a lot of \"special items\" but a lot of the classical dim sum dishes were not available.  Presentation of the food was nice. It was all displayed on individual plates with side garnishes and pine nuts, etc.  The food itself was luke warm though....some hot items even felt cold on the inside. Taste wise was average or maybe even below average. A lot of the dishes were either too salty (cuz of the sauces already poured onto them) or too bland.  If you are comparing the taste of \"luxury\" dim sum places, this is definitely BELOW PAR. Casa Imperial, Casa Victoria, Crown Prince and Crown Jewel tastes way better than here.  I think it's nice to come here once to try/see something different, but that's about it. If I wanted dim sum again, I would go to other restaurants.  Also, service was pretty bad. We made reservations, but the hostess didn't even walk us to our table...so we were completely lost when we first entered. The servers were also not impressive. They bumped into me when putting a dish on the table and didn't even apologize. They also refilled our teas ONLY when we flagged for them to do so.  The bathrooms are also located UPSTAIRS, which was also a slight inconvenience. They do have a handicap bathroom on the main floor, but that's only one stall. The bathrooms are individual rooms which made it seem extra fancy, but the toilets didn't feel clean....so that's also a minus."}
{"text":"Trying to be high end, classy Chinese restaurant, but just missed the mark best describes it.  I came here tonight with my husband to celebrate my birthday.  Decor: Modern, clean lines, elegant. Lots of round booth seats for 2-4 ppl in the middle of restaurant and rows of tables of 6 along the sides. I didn't see any big round tables for 10+. Maybe they have some private rooms?   Service and ambience: I know they are really trying hard to provide top notch service, but it just ain't cutting it. You only know what you know. They need to take lessons from the service industry. Ya, I know this is a Chinese restaurant and if you don't hear plates clanging then that's pretty good. But I also heard your kitchen staff conversation from the back. I also heard your staff being trained in front of our table. We accidentally dropped food on the table cloth. We are so sloppy, but please get a napkin or crumb sweep to clean it off. So you see, if you are trying to be high end and charge high prices, I'd expect you do your homework too.  Food: We ordered a set menu for 2. ($138) Came with  1)sashimi plate - ok/ meh. there was scales on one of my sashimi. Not premium grade fish. 2)fried oysters with honey and black pepper- only came with two pieces 3)2.5 lb lobsters two ways: claws were stir fried, body was steamed - good , not exceptional 4)snow pea shoot in fish broth- pretty good 5) dessert was pumpkin sago soup ( no flavour) and a sad looking fruit plate.. The food was good, but not exceptional.   So this place is not good value for the money. Just a pretentious place for people to flaunt their money.   Funny tip: they don't take credit cards. They will accept cash, debit and a credit card from China!???"}
{"text":"This seafood place is very similar to Fishman Lobster House in terms of tastes and how they prepare them.  Toronto area has been flooded with these seafood places selling 10 lbs lobsters and 15 lbs crabs.  This is a more upscale restaurant at least compare to Fishman Lobster house, they've got many private rooms which is great for large family dinner but prepare to pay a fortune.  Fishman Lobster House does not offer private dinning rooms.  Just to give you an idea, 10 adults dinner would easily set you between $1000-$1600.  I've been here twice and both times I was treated.  Twice we've gotten the fancy sashimi platter that smokes with dry ice.  I'm not sure if I recommend it because it's got a really strong fishy smell to it.  Maybe because they leave the body of the fish on the plate therefore the fishy smell.  Lobsters and crabs are good but nothing special, I think almost every Chinese seafood place can prepare them very similarly.  Service is very good, professional staff."}
{"text":"Came here to sample some of their new additions to the dim sum menu.  Really enjoyed it and will be back again.    Food:  We ordered the \"Big Red Po\" tea which is not usually offered at other dim sum places which was nice.  I like this tea flavor a lot.  The dim sum menu selection is average but the quality is nice.  Dishes were unique and the taste was wonderful.  See pic for some of the unique items that I enjoyed.  For savory dishes, I especially enjoyed their seafood pancake and sticky rice. For the sweet dishes, the dumpling was very unique sitting in a tart with a pineapple bun on the top.  The pink leaf wrapped dessert tasted as great as it looks.  The Napoleon cake was huge.  It looked nice but I wouldn't order it again.     Service:  We were a large group so we sat inside the rooms.  It was nicely decorated and lots of places to hang up our jackets and comfortable seating.  However, most of the servers spoke mandarin and would refer us to 1 server who understood us (even though we spoke Cantonese and English)."}
{"text":"We came for family dinner and had their Lobster and Alaskan King Crab Set Dinner for 6.   Service: Service was poor. 4 family members arrived earlier and were already seated. We arrived 5mins later and the server led us to our table which was still missing 2 seats. The servers were informed about that but we still ended up waiting for at least 5 mins standing in our \"seat\" which made us feel awkward. Several waitresses had passed just ignoring us.   After being served the 4th dish, one female server informed us that they were short with the papaya birds nest dessert and requested that we change to a beef dish.  We asked if we could deduct the price of the papaya dessert but they insisted that they could only switch it to a savory beef dish. We felt it was unfair as they should have told us about that while they took the order or before they served anything to give us the opportunity to order something else and not after they have already served several dishes. At the same time, the cost of birds nest should have been much more expensive than a beef dish, shouldn't they at least offer something that 's of equal value? We asked to speak with their manager, the manager never came to our table but the staff later informed us that they got it settled. I'm not sure how they settled it, did they split but the birds nest and gave less portions that night ? Or someone else settled for their offer?   Towards the end, they served us a \"Fruit tray\" on 2 small plates while we saw other tables getting a nice looking fruit tray......Although it is complementary, it made us feel we were probably treated differently because we didn't settle in for their \"deal\".  Their last dessert was steamed rice dumplings which took over 30 mins from the papaya dessert to arrive. I'm pretty sure they had missed the order but they explained that somehow the taste of the first batch was weird and the chef decided to make it again.   Environment: beautiful decor. The waiting area is amazing. They serve fruit infused water for guests that are waiting. Good lighting and fixtures and  overall the place is clean and tidy Food:  The food tasted good.  The deep fried dishes were crispy, the steamed dishes were just right. The only thing is that the food preparation technique lacks variation. The way they prepared one of the lobster dish and the crab dish was almost exactly the same.   Overall: Although the food was good, we were very disappointed with their service and given that it was a pricey restaurant with so many servers walking around, I feel that they should have done a much better job."}
{"text":"Best lobster iv had in toronto, its pretty pricey so be ready for that BUT the funny part is they don't take credit card when its pricey !!"}
{"text":"I brought my mom to Yu Seafood after having been here with friends once for dim sum. We were greeted at the reception area and I had some infused water. While waiting, I went through the menu and picked what I wanted to order. In less than 15 minutes the lady at the front took us to our table. Until that point, I was very much looking forward to our meal.  I couldn't give another star because as soon as I sat down I could feel the cold air blowing down from the AC on the ceiling. I asked the server who just finished helping the table beside us if we could be seated at a different table. She said feel free to sit down at this vacant table next to ours. She muttered over her walkie talkie as I was about to sit down she then went sorry you can't sit here this is for 4 people. The lady at the front showed up and told me that we couldn't sit there because there were other people waiting for that table and if I wanted to change seat there was another 15-minute wait. I just couldn't be bothered and went next door for Sunday Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Came here on Victoria Day and boy was it busy. We were fortunate to receive a table after waiting for only 20 Minutes, especially given that the whole foyer was full of families and guests waiting to be seated.   We were pleasantly surprised to see a lovely, clean, and elegant dining room. And it was REALLY packed!! Despite the peak lunch hour, service was top-notch and quick. The servers were very attentive and constantly came over to give us clean plates.   We ordered some garlic fried lobster, a wide variety of staple dimsum items (har gow, siu mai, shrimp rice noodle roll, baked BBQ pork bun, etc.) and a fried rice. Waaaayy too much for 3 people, but it was a feast to remember for sure. We were hoping for more lobster meat in the lobster dish but I guess that's just the way the cookie crumbles. Overall a great experience at Yu Seafood and I would visit again."}
{"text":"Pricey.  Quality is good.  Just go to Fisherman's club house. Same food for cheaper price."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on a recommendation by Charles Yu the Chinese food chowhound guru, and was very impressed with the food.  Lovely decor and tastefully done art work for a change (I'm so use to the nearby hideous fancy chinese restaurant art).  Service was good except for one grumpy waiter.  Food was well presented and fresh.  Prices were: Dish prices are very reasonable: S $3.10, M $4.10, L $5.10, XL $6.10."}
{"text":"Visiting from Richmond, BC. This place is probably one of the best dim sum places I have ever been to. The interior design is beautiful with ceramics lining the walls. The FOH staff were spot on, very attentive although a tad forgetful when busy (they gave us what we asked for eventually, when the pace slowed down a bit). The facilities are very wheelchair friendly, with the handicap washroom being beside the staircase leading to the main washroom. The food tasted great! Their gold leaf/black sesame egg custard buns were incredible. Even though it was dimsum, I wish they had more vegetable options. Cleanliness was great. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place as I heard excellent comments about their dim sum, but sadly I would say this place is average at most. The interior design of this restaurant is more modern compared to other Chinese cuisines.   We arrived around 10:45am and was told it would be around a 15 minute wait but we waited around half an hour for a table.   The washrooms are upstairs and each washroom is it's own separate stall with sink.   The dim sum prices are comparable to other high end cuisines, like Casa Imperial or Casa Victoria. The dim sum is around average, but the presentation is more elegant.   Anything with bamboo charcoal is very instagrammable, but I found the texture very grainy. The bamboo charcoal and egg yolk bun is a lava bun, which not many dim sum places offer. The durian filling in the bamboo charcoal tart was very creamy and filled with durian.  We asked for chili oil THREE times for the cashew nut, chicken and vegetable dumplings, but we never got it. All other dim sum places usually serve this dumpling with the chili oil, but not here. Also, I find that peanuts would be better than cashews as they have a more nutty taste.   The shrimp and scallop dumplings are cute, but no scallop taste at all.   The seafood crepe with chives didn't have much seafood and tasted very bland.  Overall, this place is average at most."}
{"text":"The Shark fin soup served here is pretty legit. Good atmosphere but the service was 6/10. With the price on the menu, suggest a fine dining restaurant but they are in so much hurry trying to change your plates because they get so busy and faster one clients out means more business.."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and we had 2 large tables within the Yu Seafood private room for Mother's day.  I found it necessary to write a review on Yelp to share with the public audience:  - on the pricey side (style and food is no different from a typical seafood comparable competitor in Toronto at easily a 15% premium) - they ran out of DESSERT! (in my 25+ years of eating in Toronto restaurants) I have never been to a mid-high end Chinese restaurant for dinner where they ran out of dessert.  Note that the dessert was part of the set menu and no explanation or alternative was provided - meal was poorly timed and started coming out after 1 hour of our original start time (we had to ask them if the food was coming before it actually came) - towards the end of the meal, one of the servers came in and asked who was paying for the bill.  It should be mentioned that one of the veggie dishes for one of the tables did not come at all and we had to remind the manager of this.  Even before this missed dish came, 3 of the servers were within the private room asking and waiting for us to pay.  What was the rush???  We felt a bit overwhelmed by this like we were going to run off and not pay.  This is general feedback for Yu, thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Came here on friend's recommendation last night... Unique table set up,  bright with nice deco. Want to  try out the  fin soups, didn't get disappointed. Other dishes we're not bad either. However, the Lamb chops dish stand up but not in the good way. Tasteless and over price. Since it's only on the set menu, if you order it as a side dish it'll cost you $70."}
{"text":"Nothing worth the time or effort to go there unless you are a big into Chinese bun.  The restaurant was tailored for mainlanders style: fancy decor, decent plate settings, extreme dirty birthrooms.    The food is mediocre.  The only good dish is ?????(aka bbq pork bun with crispy layer).  The ??? (pear shaped dim sum) is too wet inside, even though the outside dough is nice.  The spareribs is too fatty and not much pumpkin in the dish.  The lobster congee got no seafood portion.  I didn't have the seafood dish this time, but if I recall my last few experiences, it wasn't that great compared to the other fellow Chinese restaurants in the same neighbourhood.  Overall, I will go there, only if my Asian relatives made me.   ------- Updated on Dec 1 The restaurant owner reached out to us very promptly with on the house offer.  It was nice, but no thanks"}
{"text":"The place is fancy and looks expensive but their dim sum prices are average.  Dim sum is clean and taste great but selection is limited.  I hate it when tripe isn't offered during dim sum as it's what I look forward to eating -wouldn't come back for that reason.  I like selection."}
{"text":"Decent food. Fishermen lobster or even congee queen can do better than this. Nice decor but that is it. I don't expect too much service from a Chinese restaurant but I gotta say that the hostess and waitress weren't welcoming at all. Won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Let me start my review by saying cash or debit card only! With that said, this place is a must try if u love crab or lobster. The place reminded me of omei a little but with the 4 way steamed, but the fried crab legs were the bomb. The starter soup was also pretty good. The service was superb in my opinion. I never had to ask for anything. The waitress we had was very attentive. Well deserving of our 20% tip. Would definitely come back here again once I finish paying off my negative debit card balance lol. Keep up the great job."}
{"text":"Checked it out on Friday and tried the combo for 10 people for $800. The lobster and crab here are massive but lack flavor because the meat is no longer tender since the lobster/crab are older I guess.   Our combo included the lobster tower, crab/lobster legs, fried oyster, fried rice, clam soup, sashimi. The sashimi was delicious. Besides that, all the dishes are fried or heavy but sorta bland.  You get a lot of food though...that said, it wasn't really memorable and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Poor for dim sum.  Food: 3/5 Expensive and not tasty. Just looks good.  Service: 2/5 Rude to young guests. Environment: 4/5 Modern and clean.  Washrooms: 4/5 Okay Worth it?: 2/5 pass for dim sum.  Markham is home to many dim sum restaurants. Unfortunately this place doesn't rank high in my books.   This place is pricey when compared to other places in the area. This would be okay if they we're better but I think they fall short. Typical dishes are compariable and there special dishes like charcoal infused buns are dry and tough. They do look good so if Instagram is life it may be for you.   The staff is rather rude to younger groups. Don't expect to have your tea pot filled without asking or your order to placed nicely on the table. I know it's not that's typical for dim sum but the decor and price leads you to expect otherwise.   I don't plan to come back. If you still want to check it out don't bother making a reservation. We called in and they insisted we come early (9 am) as they get busy but they were empty still when we left at 11am."}
{"text":"Beautiful and elegant interior design (my friend worked in it). High ceiling and great ventilation, makes it feel very classy and comfortable ... like a hotel!  Each china piece is printed with their logo nicely. A great display of crabs and fishes as you walk in, feels like the aquarium.  Bathrooms are individual stalls, clean, nicely done. They also offer other essentials like mouthwash, toothpicks etc within the stalls. However, the bathrooms are at second level so don't wait too long if you need to go cause you'll have to make a flight of stairs.  Food is nicely presented and served however, I think its high in MSG ... I can feel it right after. They're tea is nice though, better quality than most.  Some bussers are kind of emotionless and not too responsive. Some servers are great some were also emotionless.   They're seafood selection is great, sometimes though they'll only carry heavy bigger items so you will have to add to the cost of your combos to make up the difference.   They're lunch menu are good deals too.   Dim sum selection is okay and a lot of delicate items special to the restaurant. If you like bbq pork bun you should try the?????, fresh out of the oven and very very soft.   Overall a nice presentable restaurant good to host dinners and gatherings."}
{"text":"This review is for their dimsum. Yu Seafood REALLY tries to be fancy for dimsum, and it hurts them more than it helps. The food comes out very slowly, and the \"elevated\" versions of classic dishes dont taste much better than the regular ones. The portion sizes are smaller than normal, and the \"unique\" element doesnt add much to the dish.  That being said, the food isnt bad at all, but just overpriced for what you get. The inside decor is really nice and modern, and bathrooms are clean with your own personal sink."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum. The quality is good and the presentation is even better. The food is beautifully presented and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very chic. I like the large circular booths which have a cozy vibe. The only thing is that this restaurant is a little pricier than other dim sum restaurants and it doesn't have the early bird special. I want to come back and try their dinner menu some day."}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed my meal. I showed up near closing and the place looks like a movie set.   Music very nice piano jazz.   Lobster was a monster. Perfectly prepared.  I am looking forward to testing out lunch Dim Sum.  Only minor issue. Menu only Chinese..."}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I came here for dim sum, as I heard that this was a \"fancier\" restaurant and I've always been a bit uncomfortable with super high end dim sum. They have a decent number of food items on the menu for dim sum, and our group was seated inside a nice room. The decorations are very modern and nice and not typical of a Chinese restaurant. Inside the room, we also had a dedicated staff member help us refill the tea pot and collect our orders. That was certainly a plus.  The food: our group ordered a number of dim sum items, and I have to say that they were all fairly good. The plain rice noodle rolls really stood out to me, they were silky smooth and delicious. On top of the regular hoisin and peanut sauce, it also came with a mango sauce. Quite interesting, and good. On top of dim sum, we ordered a plate of veggies and a tan-tan noodle bowl. The noodles were a bit disappointing, as they only had one flavour: spice. Maybe the kitchen forgot other flavouring that morning? The presentation of some of the food items was interesting, and their twist on it was equally unique. For example, I love lotus leaf rice. Yu's take on it was to serve 3 portions of it, unwrapped, and in a long rectangular shape. It also seemed as though the top of the rice was quickly pan fried, so it was slightly crunchy. 3 small pieces of pan fried chicken accompanied the dish on the side. It was good, but not what I was looking for.   Overall, I had a positive experience here. Maybe one day I will get the chance to try some of their famous seafood during dinner. They have impressive display tanks near the front entrance, filled with giant lobsters and king crabs."}
{"text":"Our group of 6 people came in for a birthday dinner. Don't let the $$ on Yelp fool you, it's really closer to $$$. The seafood listed on their set menu is in pounds but almost always they are unable to provide that weight. For instance, our set menu came with a 6 pound lobster, but obviously they couldn't find one and we had to pay more for a 6.5 pound lobster. And our 6 pound crab was closer to 7.4 pounds. So what's the point of listing out the weight and price? So whatever your set menu price is, just be prepared to pay a lot more.  The food was fairly good, I would give it 4 stars. The lobster was done really well and I like the variations of the crab-- both the black truffle and stir fry with garlic.  I would give them 2 stars for the service. If I'm spending $1000 on a meal eating seafood, I would expect a cloth napkin. We walked past other tables when we were leaving and noticed some tables were given plastic gloves to eat with and others were not.   The servers are all dressed nicely, with their earpieces and everything so you would expect great service, but it took multiple tries to just get some sauce.   I might go back if my friends wanted to do dinner there, but I would never go back on my own or host anything there, especially if you're trying to impress with a high scale ambiance. It just doesn't live up to its decor and price point."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Not the best but not the worst. One thing I like about this place is that it's very clean and nicely renovated. The old wasabi sushi buffet restaurant.  They have no weekday or grand opening special.   I prefer dragon boat dim sum any day but this serves as an alternative if you want to go somewhere less busy and really really clean."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.0/5.0  Hotel lounge style environment with comfortable seating are the good things about this restaurant, but the rest goes downhill from there.  A couple examples:   Their siu mai dumplings were lacking in flavour and did not come out steaming hot as you would expect if it were in a traditional steamer. They were accompanied with some breaded scallops that were cold, soggy and overly salty from the sauce it was covered in.   Their egg tarts had this stiff texture on the flakes of the crust that felt like it had been left standing for a while and reheated before it was brought out. The birds nest and pomelo added no value to the overall taste.  This place tries to present themselves as an upscale restaurant serving up dim sum with a bit of modern flare but definitely failed on execution and overall food quality was subpar.  Don't bother wasting your time at this place."}
{"text":"Top-notch dim sum and seafood dishes. They put an interesting spin on the usual traditional Chinese dishes with some seafood here and some seafood there. Seafood heaven, basically. They have eel rice noodle rolls, shark fin soup dumplings, shrimp and fish har gow etc... Great variety of dishes and still quite affordable. Their buns and pastries are flaky and delicate (bbq pork buns and egg tarts are a must try!!), rice and noodles made to impress. Would definitely recommend this place for those looking for a more upscale Chinese dim sum experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum today, wait wasn't too bad.  Overall started off pretty good, but got to the table and looking through the dim sum paper to find out that they have already sold out of the activated charcoal salted egg bun. Sat down at 11am and already sold out.  Not really sure why it's already out by hear from other they always run out very early. Really wanted to try it but did not have the chance.  Substitute it with the purple yam salted egg sesame ball which was very good. Balance of sweetness and saltiness was a good combo. Portuguese tart was also very good as well.  All food was pretty good until I got my steak chicken feet, after taking a bite I saw a piece of hair on the chicken feet. Manager was very quick to replace the dish but I was not impressed by then."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. I came here to host my baby girl's 100 day dinner, and the staff was amazing. Yes, the prices here are certainly on the high side, but the quality of food and service is what sets it apart.   Because the location is large, they have private rooms for even one large table of if you want. We opted for the two table private room so we were more comfortable as a group of 18. The head server came and introduced herself as soon as we got there, and made sure we were well looked after right up until the end of her shift, when she introduced me to the new person who would be caring for our party.  The food was delicious! I wish I had taken photos of it, but I had to care for the 3 month old pumpkin :( It was all well presented and very delicious, and even my 2.5 year old was willing to eat a lot of the dishes (she's a picky one). Because we were short a few people, we had lots of food left over, and everyone was stuffed by the time the rice and noodles came (so we took it home to enjoy the next day).   The place is really far for me to go to on a regular basis, so I don't know how their dim sum and casual dinner is, but for a special party occasion, I would consider this place again.  NOTE: We picked the menu on their website (the party menu was entirely in Chinese), but they said they had to up the price from the one listed due to it being outdated. Ended up costing $100 more per table, but still cheaper than the other options they were presenting us."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and ordered a dinner for 8 combo with lobster and crab.  Be prepared to eat messy!"}
{"text":"Yu Seafood is definately a higher end restaraunt. You instantly know upon entering the restaraunt and all the way to the branded sanitary wipes that were good quality. The service here was great and they were very attentive. We had the lunch lobster and turbot combo for $138 and a har gow and sui mai. I would have to say that the har gow and sui mai were great! The meal was great and you could actually taste the fish (magi) and lobster (deep fried tower) whereas other restaraunts you only taste the sauce.  Overall the restsraunt is great and definately worth the visit, especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to come by several people with the promise of having delicious dim sum. Several friends and I reserved a table for 5 people for 9:30 AM on a Sunday and the restaurant was plenty empty early in the morning. While my phone experience was spectacular and added to my anticipation of a delicious meal, I must say I was slightly disappointed.   The food itself was good but not amazing. We ordered the pumpkin and corn congee and there was literally enough for 1 bowl per person.  The charcoal buns were an interesting take and definitely worth getting for the Instagram pics. However, the outer shell was grainy, dry and disappointing despite how aesthetically pleasing it looked. The steamed egg and papaya dessert was also disappointing as there was like 3 tiny pieces of papaya in the whole bowl.   Overall, the service was good over the phone, a little subpar in house (possibly because we were younger than the usual clientele?) and the food was average. I will end by saying that they might be better at dinner/seafood than dim sum."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time visiting Yu Seafood for my birthday with my family.  Right at the beginning,  there was a hostess bringing me in to the designated table and a waitress asking the type of tea I wanted (they offered a handful of selection).   We ordered one of the combinations for four people which came with soup, plate of fresh sashimi, 6 lb lobsters, vegetables, fish and rice. The food was very fresh and tasty.  My favorite by far was the lobster :)!  The staff we're very attentive at all times, making sure we were comfortable and ensured our plates were replaced or whatever requests we needed were met.   Overall,  it was a very positive experience. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times  to give it a fair try.  The food is only good for taking pictures. Its salty and generally not tasty. Service is hit or miss here. One time it was super disorganized and took forever to get more tea. Sadly the price is the only thing that is high end here. This place is overrated and over priced. I'm done with this place now with all the other better options nearby."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner. Food was good. Great experience for new dimsum menus. Service was good. Price was ok. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Its upscale Chinese dimsum during brunch hours. All the foods we had (and we sampled a LOT of items since we had 13 people) were delicious.  The Lau Sha baos were very pretty and tasty but tend to break on the bottom so be careful as the inside gooey stuff can be very hot. Price point is decent given the quality so overall I would say good value.   Our private room had a motorized lazy susan... It was great!    Service was quick and they came by pretty often, better than most dimsum places.   Favourite dishes: Loh mai Gai (glutinous rice chicken); Har gow (shrimp dumpling), glutinous fried rice, deep fried squid tentacles."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but for this place I will. I'm going to start off by saying this is not a good place to eat at. Everything is overpriced, from dim sum to dinner. We felt ripped off as we don't think we got our money's worth. Presentation wise, everything from food to the restaurant looked great but that was pretty much it. We spent $1000 on dinner and expected amazing food. We did not get that, not even close. I've had $10 meals that have tasted so much better than Yu. Please save your money and do not come here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is totally underrated. Let me just clarify that this is a top notch fine seafood cuisine, so bare this in mind before expecting a cheap meal.  The decor is absolutely gorgeous, you first walk in and you're greeted by a front receptionist. Just beside the entrance they have a massive aquarium where they hold some of the largest lobsters, crabs and fishes you have ever seen. The bathroom is a single luxury suite equipped with mouth wash, q tips.. Etc.  Service is beyond superb, as waiters and waitresses are very friendly and attentive to your every need. They also help you separate your meal into plates and bowls for every guests. They are very efficient in cleaning our plates right when it gets full.  We had breakfast and dinner here the same day, so the prices differ extremely between the two.  Breakfast is dim sum style, we had a table of 8, and ate roughly $300 with a bag of leftovers.  The dinner comes in sets of meal that matches up with suggested serving sizes from 2 up to 12 people. The prices start at around $300 and up to $1700. We had a set of lobster and crab meal, for 8 people, the set itself was around $800. We ordered other dishes and wine, the bill came up to be about $900. The meal was very filling and there were still lots of left overs, we ended up packing up 2 bags.   To be honest we could probably pull off a 6 people meal set as they give a lot.   I didn't take pics of every dishes but in our set we had,  Sashimi platter  Clams  Sea cucumber  12lb lobster  2 crabs Fish  Rice Soup  Desert drink  Fruit platter"}
{"text":"We went here for my mom's birthday and ordered the two people seafood platter (not sure what is exactly called because my parents ordered the food)  The environment ambiance was very fancy and high class. The washrooms were extremely fancy, had a hotel feel.  The food on the other hand was not as fancy as expected. The cool thing was they bring out your seafood out alive and show you how big it is (and they are absolutely huge!) The food did have nice presentation, but the taste was mediocre, and was not any better than the other cheaper seafood places we've been to. So that was very disappointing for me. Overall I think this is a nice restaurant to go to on special occasions to treat yourself and family.  But for the price and quality of food we got I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We went on Tuesday this week for dinner with a lot of friends from Porsches club. We love all the dishes there especially the seafood dishes. We had lobster, fish, sashimi, chicken, beef, mushroom and veg. All were good. The service is excellent, staffs are friendly. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went there with my family of six. It is a little bit pricey but worth the food quality, service and decor. Good for a family or friend gathering.  We ordered the combo for five people, including lobster, crab, shark fin soup, steamed turbot fish(I guess), scallops and shrimp, Pea Sprout and etc. All of them are well prepared and taste excellent. The texture of the seafood is great and seasoned just right. Thanks to the freshness and perfect flavor, I really enjoy the seafood delicacy here.  Wanna try their dim sum next time."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner because we wanted lobster dinner.   Even with a reservation, as soon as we arrived we were told we only had a 2-hours seating limit. With some people in our party arriving late and a small baby, it was a bit of a concern. We saw empty tables throughout the night and they didn't rushed us out.  It was too bad that they forgot one of our dish (French Turbot) and it was served at the end of the meal after we asked them twice.  Ambiance: The restaurant seems to have ample of space but I felt really cramped at our table. Fitting a baby seat was a problem and we had to juggle some furniture around.  Food: The menu was in Chinese only and there was no English!!! Not cool. Only one person in our party could read Chinese and she had to make all the decision for the order. Not a lot of variations were available for the set dinners. We ended up with a set lobster dinner for 4 ($298) and 2 veggie dishes on the side.  Our set lobster dinner came with: Fresh sashimi - Weird to eat sashimi with Chinese food but the sashimi was very fresh! I would totally came here for sashimi only.  Eel with black bean sauce was done well. The eel was tender and the black bean sauce wasn't too overpowering.  Fried lobster was huge and the fried bits were very crisp. It was one of the best Chinese fried lobsters because it wasn't greasy and not too salty. We changed the lobster with rice in soup to a fried rice with lobster. The fried rice was very well done.  Steamed French Turbot - the fish was very firm and not much taste in it. Because it was served so late (after lobster fried rice) we were so full and couldn't eat much.   Our 3 vegetable dishes - Pea shoots with goji berries, Stir fry mushrooms and broccoli, and green beans with olives was light, not too salty and not greasy.   Overall, the food was very good. Mainly because they were not greasy and salty. But price wise, Yu Seafood is on the expensive side. Usually a $298 set dinner would include a crab and a lobster and may be a few more dishes.  It will still be my choice for seafood but only when I feel I could splurge on a dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on Saturday, the whole restaurant is full. Better to make reservation.  The front reception has no smile We didn't feel welcomed as the first time customers.  This is my impression when I stepped in this restaurant.  The decor looks modern and clean. I enjoyed walking through the corridor with fish and seafood tanks along my way to the inside area.  Food quality : average Price : overpriced Service: average  Will i return to dinner ? I think it is not worth to spend this much on seafood. Can give a try. The lobster is deep fried, all I tasted was garlic , salty sauce and fried meat . I cannot recognize the taste of lobster . You can order steam.  The oil was excessively used on vegetables , we had veggie in soup but it is covered oil on the top. That could be improved. The excitement of seeing huge giant lobster maybe over the excitement of eating. The taste is nothing special.   But I will return to try their dim sum.  ** thank you for your follow up !looking forward to try the dim sum"}
{"text":"-Service is very slow -Service is very inconsistent -Food is mediocre -Nothing really stood out -Restaurant is nicely decorated, but the food quality doesn't match the standard of the interior  -Servers don't really clear the tables -Our server \"SUNNY\" didn't seem to be attentive at all -There are much better options in the area -Prices are very steep and not worth it -Service is very slow, but grabbing the bill is very quick  ***Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated with Chinese art and paintings. Specialized in seafood so you can get fresh lobsters or king crabs here. Whats nice is that is they offer set menus (a multi course meal for 2,3,4...people) which is convenient. Like any typical Cantonese restaurant you start with free tea and soup and end with sweet soup ?? and fruits. Food in general is fresh but taste is okay but nothing extrodinary."}
{"text":"Had a couple of clients bring me to this restaurant the other day and I must say that I was mostly impressed. There were a couple of big problems that they have to fix though.  For those who don't know, this is a new seafood place in Richmond Hill that replaced the old wasabi Japanese buffet. The did a fantastic job on the decor and even added a seafood market next door in order to fresh seafood to their clients. If you liked the dish, you could visit the market next door and buy what you ordered.  Getting into the place was a pain. There wasn't enough parking so we had to park at the other side of the mall. That would be ok if it wasn't snowing or freezing.  Reservations there are a joke. We had a reservation at 8, but because they were so busy, we didn't get our seat until 9. People were getting in who arrived after us.  The food was fantastic. Service was fast and the food came out fast as well. Keep in mind that we had a private room so the minimum order if for 10 people. The dinner is preset so all you have to do is pick one set and they will arrange it for you. They bring the seafood out prior to cooking to confirm that it is fresh and alive. Once you confirmed the weight and the animal, they start cooking  Overall a little pricy but well worth it."}
{"text":"Overall, good food, bad service. May or may not come back again.   I was here before for dim sum, now I've come back for dinner. I've done another review for lunch which you can read. This one will be on my dinner experience.  We got there at 6:45pm with a reservation but the restaurant didn't seem to be at capacity (no line ups, some empty tables) for a Saturday night. Yet, a waitress rudely comes over when we sat there waving two fingers and telling us there's a 2 hour seating limit. Well, we waited 20 minutes and no one came by to take our order. We had to flag someone down for that. We were also not allowed to keep a stroller in the dining room despite there being room for it in the corner so I had to stow it by the main entrance. Server did not help me figure out how I'd get the logistics done, he just told me to get rid of the stroller so I also had to find away to remove a seat from the table to put a high chair in its place.  We got a set menu for 4 people. It came with a 6lb lobster. OF COURSE they were sold out of 6lb lobsters and forced us to buy a 7lb for an extra $26. It's the same tactic Fishman  Lobster Club House uses. Very annoying.  The food came out fairly quick and it was good. The cubed beef was very tender. Presentation is nice. Lobster (with Maggie sauce) was comparable to Fishman Lobster Club House. Vegetable portion size was good. Overall, good food.  We finished eating but still had a lot of leftovers so I would suggest ordering a set menu for 4 if you have 5-6 people.  We sat there and now it's past the 2 hour seating limit But the restaurant was emptying out so no one cared if we stayed. But in fact, we wanted to get our dessert and go yet no one was around to serve us. It took a long time to get our dessert and a long time to get our cheque and a long time to get the debit card machine to pay (btw, very annoying that it's cash or debit only considering how large the cheque sizes are here). We asked for the box my birthday cake came with and instead they give me two soup containers to put the leftover cake in, which meant I had to cut up the cake and squish it in.  Anyhow, for a place that seems to want to have a more upscale ambiance and overall experience vs Fishman Lobster Club House, I didn't feel I was getting that experience. So, I don't see why I'd choose this place over Fishman's."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Went for a Chinese New Years dinner, food and service is definitely not up to a standard of a high end Asian cuisine. We were a party of 8, but we were giving two square tables in a corner to sit in. Asked if we could sit at round table but said no unless we spend a minimum of $500. Because we were at a small table, there were limited space to place food, we were rush to finish our food in order to accommodate for space. We ordered a set dinner which comes with their most popular dessert. But we were told at the end of our meal that today they did not serve it. Instead of offering us another alternative they just shrug us off. Until we kept asking did they \"try\" to do something. They gave us a small bowl of gluten balls and told us to share among ourselves. (It was not even cooked)  The worst of all from their service was they counted the money in front of us and whispered behind our backs. It was no only one person counting it but the manager called two other people to count it and made sure we didn't leave. Not the kind of behaviour you would expect a high end cuisine.  The food was not out of this world for the price they are asking. Taste like the regular Asian Resturant I go to.  I wouldn't recommend anyone going for dinner, at lease not at the price they are asking for."}
{"text":"Perfect place for rich people from China that don't speak English! The d√©cor is beautiful and the servers only speak Chinese. The food was meh, not worth the price. Like other reviews, you're better off going to fishman lobster clubhouse. Also they don't know how to time their food. Even though we had one of the biggest tables, they all came at the same time and certain plates had to be placed on another table where they got cold."}
{"text":"If you're looking for high quality dim sum, this is the place to go. Very impressed with the fancy presentation of the dishes, as well as the d√©cor of the restaurant. Their specialty dishes such as eel rice roll, teppanyaki beef cubes and durian puff pastry are some of my many favorites. Also another must try is their shrimp roll with mayonnaise! It sounds ordinary but they add their own twist to it that makes it truly addicting!"}
{"text":"This review is based on dinner.   We had the mother's day combo for $288, which comes with a lot of good stuff: -18 pieces sashimi -Lobster/pumpkin cream soup -scallion chicken (cold) -scallop & shrimp in herb sauce -Giant lobster -Steamed fish -Lobster fried rice -Papaya/white fungus dessert  We added a mushroom e-fu noodle on top as we were afraid seafood wouldn't be filling enough.  The highlight is definitely the lobster. Big chunky pieces with lots of meat. I love the fried garlic style that I don't know the English name for. Sashimi is much more fresh than your typical AYCE place. The cold chicken is pretty standard. The lobster fried rice probably should have been bigger portion but there are good chunks of lobster \"goo\" in it. So it tasted good. The scallop shrimp dish was also very good. Big pieces of scallop and shrimps. That herb sauce was superb.  Now for the bad...the e-fu noodle was pretty meh. Hardly any scallop in it. Mostly noodles and sauce. Not even much mushroom. My mom threw a fit about the \"steamed\" fish. Before the food came, they told us they don't have sea bass and offered another type of fish. We had no choice so ok...the problem was that instead of a live steamed fish, they gave us fried fish. In Chinese food, you steam fresh fish. Frying is for dead or frozen fish.  Also, its quite common for Chinese seafood places to do this...the combo price is for 6lb lobster but they will bring the lobster over. They will nearly always pick one that's bigger and tell you to pay the difference per pound. You'll never get exactly 6lb so you always end up paying more than what the menu says.  So I would have given this place a 4 star otherwise if they didn't screw us on the steamed fish. I can let the bigger lobster thing slide since it's common practice. My mom really wanted to eat steamed fish, not fried. This is why Chinese are so good at doing business. They always find a way to screw you. They have a fish market right next door and could have easily given us any other fresh fish but wanted to unload their dead fish stock first. It's a pricey restaurant and final damage was about $400 for 5 people including tax and tip."}
{"text":"Yu Seafood is a high-end Chinese restaurant that reinvent and remains traditional Chinese dishes. The price point is higher than most Chinese restaurants in the Markham area. However, the quality of the food is excellent.   We came here for dim sum. All of the dishes were fresh and delicious. There were dishes that I had not tasted anywhere else. The standouts included the bamboo charcoal salted egg yolk buns and giant soup dumpling. The bamboo charcoal salted egg yolk buns were delightful.  The bun was soft and the filling inside was sweet and salty. The giant soup dumpling was flavourful and delicious.   If you are in Markham, check Yu Seafood out (if you want high end Chinese food)!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for quite some time now and I finally got to try it. My friend and I came for the dim sum around 1 and got seated very quickly. Upon entering this place, we were greeted by three hostess at the front. The interior of this place had a very modern chic ambiance with wooden panels around the entire restaurant.   Not only was the environment fancy, but the presentation of our food was beautifully plated as well. However, the food was mediocre, I wouldn't say it was the best. I felt like for the price I was paying, it was for the presentation rather than quality of the food.   I also noticed that their tables were quite small. A lot of the round tables would have a smaller table on the side for people to put their tea/dishes. We ordered 12 dishes in total and they came relatively fast so we had a hard time trying to fit everything onto the table.   After enjoying my meal, I had to check out the washroom because fancier restaurants like this usually has nicer washrooms and was I ever right! They have a whole separate floor dedicated to washrooms! Each stall had their own separate rooms with their own sink, a bottle of mouthwash, a stack of cups for the mouthwash, a cup of q-tips, and two boxes of Kleenex.   Overall, wonderful experience, definitely will be going back to check out their dinner menu!   Side note: even their take out containers/bag is fancy!"}
{"text":"3.5-4  You want fancy dim sum or want to impress someone? Then come here! Everything is so fancy from the interior to their tea cups to even their take out bag lol. Dim sum is on the pricey side, but their food is quite decent but limited menu. Recommended to make reservations but luckily we waited only 30 mins."}
{"text":"I came with my parents to try the dim sum.  We went the Thursday before Good Friday, when we had the big freeze.  We got there at 9.30am and there was no salt at the entrance and nobody had bothered to crack the ice.  We were slipping and sliding to get in.  We all made it in one piece but seriously, they should have sorted the entrance out.  We were then greeted by a hostess with her winter jacket on, like wth?  You're supposed to be an upscale place.  I've never seen that at any place.    You then walk past a number of windows that contain crabs, lobsters and the fish, that they serve.  My niece and nephew were fascinated, they thought it was an aquarium.  We ordered a few dim sum and the server informed us that if we added their restaurant in WeChat and ordered over $25 of food, we were entitled to one order of Har Gow for free.  Then she gave us some $5 coupons to purchase things from their market place.  All the food that we ordered was quite good.  None comes in bamboo steamers, it is all plated and looks artistic with fancy bits of extra garnish.    The decor is nice with single stall washrooms, upstairs on the first floor.  The service we had was fine because it wasn't busy but still not attentive enough .  Not somewhere that I would frequent much, not unless I had visitors.  And I don't think it's a child friendly place.  Trying to be upscale to justify the prices but Chinese places always fail on service alone.  When we left, somebody had sorted out the ice problem at the front entrance."}
{"text":"I believe in second chances. Visited again, and for dinner this time. Food was good (the stars only represents the food), while their service remains a challenge (zero stars).   It feels as though our server felt she was too good to do what she's doing. It's as if we are the guest at a friend's house and the house staff thinks we are their master's lowly friends. What's kills me is that the server interrupted our dessert to have us pay because she wanted to go home.   If you decide to visit, I hope your enjoyment is better than mine."}
{"text":"If you ever are able to venture out way in the wee out Richmond Hill, and are also looking for a seafood fix? Yu Seafood all the way! One quick word of advice, check out their menu online first because they have it available in English...whereas the physical menus in the restaurant have no English translation. Luckily my partner in crime and myself, we scoped out the food in advance and we had our eyes set on the lobster combo.   Honestly the lobster combo was such a good deal ($70 including tax and tip) and it was a perfect set meal for 2 people. We had 3 dishes: boiled/steamed lobster, lobster claw congee, and noodles with abalone. Every dish was spot on. The lobster was flavorful, the congee was really tasty (I think better than Congee Queen's congee funnily enough), the noodles were probably handmade too because they were soft/chewy/bouncy and the texture really made it different from what you would get at other places. The abalone sadly came only in 4 pieces and I wish there were more. Abalone is pretty expensive, so I guess that makes sense.  Service is quite something, definitely more elevated than your average or typical Chinese restaurant. The waiters actually serve you the dishes by scooping out the congee, putting the noodles in your bowls etc. It made me feel like VIP, you know?  There is also a fish market attached and you can see all the massive crabs and lobsters in the restaurant corridor in \"aquarium\" form. I really would try to come back to this place for their 6-8 people combos. But if you had to go with a significant other or just one other friend, opt for lobster combo."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here to try the $68 lunch combo that my friends told me about.  This include a fresh lobster (not those huge ones for this price point of course)  One bowl of lobster congee and abalone noodles.  The lobster congee was nice and since the lobster were fresh, it brings out a nice sweet flavour.  The abalone and noodles were tasty. The lobster, I am used to eating the larger sized ones so this one is a little too small to my liking. Not bad overall, in terms of flavours and freshness."}
{"text":"We got really terrible service from this place. We felt unwelcome and rushed all the way through our meal. From the start the receptionist did not even break a smile. The host who took our order was more interested in pushing his expensive \"special\" shrimp, instead of listening to what we wanted. The food came way too fast. We were only half way into our appetizer soup and two of our main dishes were already out at the same time. We worried our food would get cold so we told the waiter to slow it down. She gave us a look like we shouldn't have bothered them. The food did slow down after that but so did the service. Our plates were piled high with lobster shell and no one came to change it out. At the end of the meal, they didn't even bother cleaning out the table before serving us tong sui. The negative service experience totally over shadowed the food. We are usually very generous with tipping. But in this instance we felt the service was so unacceptable that we did not leave a tip. I know to most fellow yelpers this is unthinkable. However, I think the dining industry in general needs to start realizing that tips need to be earned. As for the food, I find it to be on par with most other decent seafood restaurants in town, but a little on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Sick private washrooms. Great ambience to help you expel the glorious foods you just ate without outside intruders. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Dim sum was very good. A huge variety and everything came out fast. Only compliant was that the bun was too dry and hard. Other than that, the foods very tasty. Service could have been better but up to Asian restaurant standards"}
{"text":"We had a Xmas banquet dinner 2 days ago. The place is very well decorated and clean. The servers all wore some sort of headphone so they can get updated and on the recent going ons in the restaurant. It seems like they are trying to run the business with precision or something  The food is great. It's all seafood.. lots crabs and fresh fish. Like many Chinese seafood restaurants, they have the obligatory tanks full of aquarium. This restaurant housed the tanks behind beautifully shaped windows, but it does not change the fact that these creatures were destined for our bellies (It's sad and I am a hypocrite for still eating seafood)  We were in a private room with a round table and the lazy susan is automatic with a remote control which we unfortunately had a bit of trouble getting used to lol... At one point, one of our dinner companion tried to put the \"public\" chopstick back but the dish had already circled away from him.  We felt a bit rushed as the they rushed us out because they had the room booked for a second seating for the evening. I don't know if this is common practice nowadays but was kinda of my first time being rushed out of a restaurant.   Although the food is great, this is not my type of restaurant. I only got the chance to try it out because I was invited to the banquet. I wish I had taken pictures of the food but since I was a guest it kinda feel odd to take pictures.   Definitely worth a try, but won't be a staple for me."}
{"text":"Parking lot is a bitch, but that isn't the fault of the restaurant. The decor is really well done especially since it is very different from what Wasabi looked like (the restaurant that was there before).   The service was average but pretty good for a Chinese restaurant, I went with my 3 close friends and we enjoyed ourselves. The selection of food is large which is always a good thing for dim sum. We also saw a lot of live seafood, so they definitely live up to their name. The booths are also pretty private from what I can tell which would be nice for intimate family gatherings. We got sat at a regular table near the sushi bar (I think). I liked it because there was a lot of stuff to look at!"}
{"text":"Went for Dim Sum only!   When you walk in, you'll notice that it's definitely nicer than a lot of other dim sum places.  I liked that it had a lot of room, in comparison to the typical dim sum cuisines. The washrooms are single stalled with full doors too, which is nice.   However, I wasn't impressed by the dim sum. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  I would not go back for them at all. There are other places that are cheaper, have more options and are actually good. The comfortable personal space hasn't won me over.  On the other hand, we saw the combo seafood lunches/dinners, and will probably give the competitive prices a try for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This place has a really great  presentation and design. it is a very fancy looking joint for those who eant to eat in a comfortable fancy environment. however the dim sum food i would say is average and the price charged seem really for decor more than anything. we had the most famous charcoal bun. which is a black bun. and honestly it was just a bun with black food colouring. it added nothing to flavour and was a regular bun for the most parts. a lot of the food is like that. in that it has potential but the results are very average tasting except the price isnt. i would recommend this to those who like food for presentation value. but if your looking dor a new or unique flavour. you definitely will not"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend and had to wait a long time as it was packed! The venue is nice, spacious, and bright. Dim sum and lunch dishes were very yummy with excellent presentation. More expensive than other dim sum places but worth it if you're willing to spend more. I recommend this place to take your significant other's parents out for the first time ;)"}
{"text":"Visiting Yu Seafood was the biggest mistake ever. All started with the moment we start to order. After the waitress writing down our order she told us it was not \"enough\" for us to be sitting in the private room. We MUST spend  $1,400 at the minimum.   This was never mentioned when I called to make reservations two weeks ago. We then insisted to speak to the manager. The waitress turned around and walked out the room. She was gone for 30 minutes then returned and said \" fine, you may order whatever you want\". This particular waitress never returned to serve us the whole time. The other two waitresses showed up but with really bad attitude. You could tell they were just cold and unprofessional. I kept my composure because I didn't want to ruin a night out with my family. At the end of the night our bill was still about $1,000. I just wanted to share this unpleasant, horrible experience I had at Yu Seafood. I will never recommend to anyone. I wouldn't even recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. Seriously."}
{"text":"- Food was not cooked completely (lobster was not fully cooked)  - food was super salty  - horrible service        - no smile        - ignored when we tried to get her attention        - rude servers  - size of the live lobster they showed us did not match the size of the cooked lobster"}
{"text":"Cash or debit only at this place. Food is good but a bit pricey.  Making reservations is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here again for dim sum a second time and thought the quality and service has gone down from the previous visit. Also ordered the rice noodle and it had no taste and wasn't very good."}
{"text":"After driving past the restaurant daily, we finally decided to try it out.  Cost is pricing (3 of us was about $400) but there was enough food for more people.  We ordered the set meal with lobster, Alaska King Crab served two ways rice, greens, oyster.  Everything was fresh, tasty and the presentation of the dishes was nice-even though the dishes were very large, the staff was attentive enough to constantly downsize the dishes so it will not clog up our table and also add an extension too!  When you factor in the stunning decor that is as nice as many hotels, comfortable seating (one of my big pet peeves is uncomfortable seating) and the great service we received from all staff, this is a very good choice to impress guests without going totally crazy on the bill (you can go crazy if you want without trying too hard).  Definitely looking forward to try out the dim sum as well as the other dishes (need to come with more people to get greater variety)."}
{"text":"Great taste of dim sum. I don't mind paying a bit more for a nicer and quieter dim sum place with family & friends than queuing up outside the door for half an hour and rush in & out in some other dim sum places.  I like the choices of congee, Chang fen?signature black steam buns with salted egg yolk and custard filling, abalone pastries were really good. It's our new place for dim sum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw this place on a Facebook video! We took the bus from Michigan just to try this place out because they are known for their presentation and their famous lobster tower.  Let's start, when you walk in, you see little windows of the lobsters, crabs, and fishes. The interior was clean and nicely decorated. It felt so fancy! Luckily, from reading everyone's reviews, my boyfriend and I got seated pretty fast. I guess we beat that lunch rush hour. We received our menus but everything was in Chinese. We talked to multiple waiters and waitresses just to tell them we wanted an English version menu! I HIGHLY request a waiter/waitresses that speaks English because they had a hard time understanding what we wanted. As we looked at the menu, we could not find the lobster tower and we tried to explain it to our waitress but she kept pointing at the lobster meal for two. We finally just gave up asking about the lobster tower and settle with the lobster meal for two. The lobster meal for two came with noodles, lobster congee, and lobster saut√©ed in  garlic/green onions! The food was good but not the best experience I would say. We also order some dim sum which was delicious! The service was great, they switch our plates and serve us our food. At the end of our meal, a guy waiter comes up and spoke perfect English. He asked about our food and we told him we were looking forward for the lobster tower but he told us we have to request that cooking style and it's a special Hong Kong cooking style! I wished I remember his name but he was so nice to us to explain it. Overall, this place can be a hit or a miss. We will come back to try again but will request someone that speaks English as our waiter or waitress.  I highly recommend this place for a family that likes dim sum!  Also, There's free wifi and their bathrooms are super fancy :)"}
{"text":"We basically had a $400-$500 bill for about 5 people, but the food was nonstop. The service is bad though. When looking around the restaurant you can see that there is no one else besides Chinese people and the servers didn't speak English (well most of them).  Our server laughed because she couldn't understand what we were saying and also dropped our plates on the table and spilled tea all over the table and on one of my guest.  The food was alright. I wasn't a fan of the fried oysters though. The fried lobster is overhyped - I honestly liked the porridge the most out of all the dishes.  Overall, the service needs to the fixed.  Being ignored and looked down upon because you are not Chinese is not professional and polite. It's rude. I sensed it right when we entered at the hostess station and all the way until the end."}
{"text":"As the restaurant was opened by the same owner as fishermans clubhouse, we had very high expectations for this restaurant.  We ordered a set dinner for 4 persons which included: assorted appetizers, Alaskan king crab cooked in 2 styles, lobster, shark fin fried rice, and pea sprouts b/c everyone needs a side of greens.  In general, everything was very delicious and was worth every penny shelled out and was enough to fill up 5 tummies.   The service a little below expectations for a high end cuisine as some staff members seemed confused at times and were not coherent with instructions from the managers. However, given the restaurant has only been opened for roughly a month, I would expect this to improve over time and turn this review into 5 stars the next time I'm back."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and this time I got to eat their king crab and lobster. Based on the reviews below, it seems like the restaurant does the \"circumstance\" that happened to us too frequently to believe it's true. We ordered a fixed combo with fixed weights for their lobster and crab. An employee then approached us and said they sold out of the weight we had order and that they only had a larger one which would cost us extra. I think we added two pounds on the lobster/crab and it came up to be an extra $130 on the bill. That's pretty ridiculous to me and when we asked for options/negotiations, they literally told us we couldn't then eat any lobster or king crab. Of course we wanted to as a family and agreed to it. I mean, if people order their fixed combos regularly, shouldn't they have their seafood around this size? The place wasn't so busy...and it's the holidays. It doesn't overall seem right to me. Food was good, but the atmosphere of the place wasn't so inviting. Some other stuff that had happened was the waiter got our order wrong and didn't admit to it, tea was never refilled and we always had to request it and plates weren't changed when it was full. For $800 meal for 10ppl, you think they could do all of those."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that Yu's sets a new standard for my seafood relationship. I stopped in for DimSum, which I knew was a mistake going solo, but I have been dying to get I here.  In order to properly assess the food, I had to eat for two to get enough of the spectrum.   Excellent and different. For example, I had the Lobster and Shrimp steamed buns, typical except seafood instead of pork inside. This was the most tender, fluffiest bun I have ever enjoyed!  The Siu Mai was also plump and perfectly steamed. The Shrimp and Scallop Dumplings were creatively presented, where the wrap was shaped to resemble sort of an origami fish, complete with eyes dabbed on and a textured tail. A LOT of extra effort for something that will vaporize off the plate when it gets within 24 inches of me!  Of course, looking at the famed Lobster Tower at the next table, all I can say is \"they were very lucky I ordered too much of my own to attack their table\"!"}
{"text":"this place is starting to go downhill for me...the food doesn't taste as good as it used to and some even lack flavour. no bueno no bueno... also some of the servers are literal poop just straight up poops"}
{"text":"Just had dimsum here with my family - Saturday at 10:30am. It was too busy when we got here but it quickly filled up closer to 11am.  I must say, the service is excellent. They have a lot of staff working today and the decor is very nice.  Siu Mai was juicy but nothing special. They had a generic sweet and spicy sauce on the side which wasn't necessary. It wasn't a good flavour combination and wasn't homemade either.  They like to garnish their dishes with mini deep fried scallops and a dark hoisin type sauce that's way too salty.  Their hor fun noodles were good, cooked perfectly - it was chewy and not too soft.   We had their fresh fruit Napoleon..which look good but when you dig into it, the fruit was not fresh at all. The fruit tips were browning and you can taste that it began to spoil already.  Overall, their food was nothing special. I wouldn't go back again. Kudos to their decor and service though."}
{"text":"Great food, clean pretty environment and friendly staff. We got the 2 person lobster set and the food was great, better than I expected. Maybe we don't eat much but in my opinion it was A lot of food. I had to take over half of it home....again, maybe it's just that we are not big eaters. Well worth the money. Highly recommend, I'll be back and bring my colleagues with me next time."}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast- words can't express this review: considering moving from NYC to Canada just because of this restaurant. The beef short rib is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum and it was alright....they have some fusion versions of classics that were just weird. Heard the hype from BlogTO and was disappointed after trying. Seem to be good quality ingredients tho!"}
{"text":"???????????????d???????12??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok.????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Nice place to be with family and friends for dim sum and dinner. There seafood is being made better than their competitors. I go there once a week and will definitely recommend others to go. Just one cons is that price is a bit high to be affordable daily.   Set meals ate valuable I recommend going for dinner menu. Lobster and king crab was perfect"}
{"text":"High end seafood-focused Chinese restaurant with quality dimsum options. They are one of the few Chinese restaurants that actually follow a reservation and will have a table set aside for you at your reserved time! Beware though, that on holidays and summer weekends, their dimsum reservations do fill up, and you'll have to go in and try your luck. The wait can get quite long, so I'd recommend trying to make a reservation in advance. Their decor is modern and new, definitely a step up from your typical Chinese place. Their menu is on the pricier end, but the quality and portion of food has always been excellent. Their seafood congee is a personal favourite, along with their fried noodle dishes. They offer lobster and seafood meals at lunch and again, although they are pricey, their quality is spectacular and they don't cheat you on the weight of your seafood! Staff and service varies from time to time, but generally they are attentive and friendly folks."}
{"text":"The review of this seafood place is for dinner that we experienced as a group. 2 times within a month. So I think I can have my say in this place now...  First time, when I called for Father's Day dinner. Booked more than 2 weeks in advance. Was advised in advance that we would only have the table for 2 hours, which is totally fine.   We were somewhat expecting the dishes to be like Fishman Lobster House in Scarborough where the seafood is topped up and we would be stuffed...from our previous numerous experiences...so we ordered a 5 person set dinner for 7 ppl..   The food dishes were particularly small,  in comparision, the ambience and seating area was better than Fishman Lobster House...(1 star)...nothing was Wow or spectacular in terms of taste...lobster deep fried, fish had a muddy taste, steamed king crab was the best thing perhaps...   Around 7:15, when all the dishes arrived and we started eating maybe a quarter thru, they kept on asking us if they can take it and pack it away...I'm like is it time for us to give the table back? They said no. So why were they rushing us leave? They claim 2 hours but they want you to leave before 1.5 hours..epic fail....( minus 2 stars) I want to enjoy my food and company, not gobble down and leave....this is not a hk cafe... please...  The second time, same thing, rushing us to leave and realizing after the fact they didn't provide all the dishes on the menu..  So that's their business strategy..sit down, order the most expensive from the menu and rush you to leave so you won't have time to enjoy and figure out what was missing from the set...  I have way better places to spend my $600-1000 dollars please  with way better service and food.... not coming back..."}
{"text":"This review is for their lunch dim sum service. We ordered several of their dim sum dishes and thoroughly enjoyed them. Their dim sum dishes were better than the average places for sure. We did not run into any service issues mentioned by some earlier reviews. In fact, I found their waiters and waitresses spread and positioned themselves well along each aisle paying attention to customers' needs. We will definitely be back whenever we are in the area again. The restaurant is well decorated even down to the washrooms actually :).  I looked at their dinner menu too. They sell their king crabs at $50/lb so it is a bit more expensive than, say, Dragon Boat which is our go-to place for eating king crab dinners. Dragon Boat used fluctuating market rates for their king crabs. I had it twice recently there for $48 and $41.80 per lb so it could be $100 difference easily on the crab alone for a typical 12 lb king crab. We may come back to try their king crab dinners on special occasions only since it is a nicer restaurant and they let you use a private room for free although you would pay a whole lot more for the king crab. For non special occasions, probably still Dragon Boat is still the best bet although you will need to pay $50 to use their private rooms."}
{"text":"Had dim sum there today. It was disgusting. Aside from the food, they had absolutely unacceptable service. The servers' trays were so ladled with food that some of them had trouble balancing them. As one server came up to our table, she almost dropped her entire tray on my lap, and then out of frustration, she threw our food onto a stack of our dishes already on the table. More importantly, I had an allergic reaction to one of their food items and the manager did not seem to care for my safety or wellbeing. They seemed to have a mentality of \"you ordered so it is your  fault\" even though I had double checked with them about my allergies. However, when we spoke to a second manager, Helen, she was kind enough to cancel the item that I was having a reaction to.   For the food items I could eat, everything was overly salty and oily. The chef seems to have no idea how to use other spices or seasonings apart from salt, but this tactic may have been employed to cover for the low quality of the foods they used to make the dim sum.  I must highlight that the dumpling wrappers they used were so thick that they were virtually impossibly to masticate. The only saving grace for this restaurant is the mediocre presentation of the food, but even that can not hide the truth: they are serving up  unpalatable  foods for exorbitant prices.   Overall, if you have any food allergies, please for the love of god do not come to this establishment. If you do not have allergies, please still save your money and your time by visiting another restaurant in the vicinity."}
{"text":"This restaurant was definitely a lot more classy and fancier than most Chinese restaurant I have been to. It was aesthetically beautiful and everything screamed EXPENSIVE. The washroom was odd, you had to go up the stairs and you arrive to a hallway. To differentiate between boys and girls there were signs on the door, in which you open to your own personal washroom. The servers were Chinese and had trouble speaking in English to us. They gave us an English menu with a set course meal. Most of the course is meat and fish based. The food was mediocre was okay and it was definitely not worth the price. The presentation was amazing but that's just about it. On this particular day, they had no more king crab so it was replaced with chicken salad, and sweet and sour pork. It was a rip-off to what we should've originally got. Also a lot of these foods are not catered to young children, and there's not much of a selection for them either. Maybe like fried rice, that you have to order on the side..At the end of our meal we were charged extra for the green bass and the waiter told us \"Only $50 tip, why not 10%....I need to know because my boss will ask me why. Was the service not good? Was the food okay? Yeah..because you might as well not give us a tip.\" LOLOL, okay. That was the last straw time to gtfo."}
{"text":"I came to Yu Seafood (???) with my family for dinner. The quality of food was great; the service was okay. We were seated in one of the rooms at the back of the restaurant for dinner. We ordered from the VIP Menu.  Highlights of the night: * Stir Fried Lobster with Noodle Fish & Garlic  - This was one of my favourites! The lobster absorbed so much flavour. It was stacked up like jenga for the display. Cool display but we found it tough getting the lobster pieces.  * Japanese red snapper sashimi platter - Loved the red snapper sashimi, sooo fresh! We would order more of this dish if we didn't order that many lol  * Steamed green bass - I loved this fish. It was very freshly cooked. Juicy and soft in texture.  The sauce needs improvement and more sauce would've made it taste better.  * King Crab boiled with sake  - Very yummy. The display was also picture-worthy. The sake flavour wasn't that strong, I actually couldn't taste it in the king crab.  \"Premium\" dessert of the day: It was grass jelly and watermelons LOLL.. I was like, what premium....?! I liked the dessert nonetheless... It wasn't exactly what I thought as what a \"premium dessert\" is though lol"}
{"text":"Place was recommended to as an alternative to the super busy other seafood place and tried it out for dinner with my family over the weekend.  Fancy interior decor that was expected from this sort of restaurant.  Had reservations so didn't have to wait long.  Set dinner was competitively priced, and had decent portions for a 5 person meal."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing restaurant.  We went there based on yelp reviews but most items are no longer on their dim sum menu.  Their food was just ok and their dim sum was not exceptional like many reviewers had recommended.  Maybe it was available a year ago when they first opened but they definitely did not keep up with all the items.  The decorations were just average. Maybe they are cleaner and nicer than most Chinese restaurants.  There is nothing here that really stands out.  They just sell average dim sum and have the same menu as Fisherman's clubhouse at night.  Many people ate the crab and lobster for lunch which I think is just too much food for a simple lunch.   I guess a lot of people like to impress others.  There are way too many restaurants in Richmond Hill.  The competition is just too much.   There are so many other choices of restaurants that you don't need to come here. Also their market will be closed.  The lady told us it will be renovated to another room in the restaurant.  I guess it wasn't doing well."}
{"text":"Went here for family dinner on the weekend. First time for me. Seafood was typical Chinese style. Service was average. And I'll give it one star less because of price and the fact that my stomach didn't feel too well later that evening. Coincidence? Not sure"}
{"text":"There is a fish market in this seafood restaurant, and last week I went there and asked for female lobster. However, the lady who worked there lied and gave us male. Their lobsters price are double from T&T supermarket and T&T workers will never lie."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch lobster combo and a few dim sum dishes.   Dim Sum: overall good taste and fusion presentation.  - Sticky Rice Chicken - usually wrapped in lotus leaf, this was presented open-concept, like sandwiches with the pork filling in between two layers of sticky rice, topped with salted egg yolk. The top of the rice was seared, giving it a nice crispy texture. Although a bit small portion and random pieces of chicken on the side, I was impressed with the presentation!  - Beef Ball - again, served open-concept on a plate instead of steamed basket. Usually not a fan of this but tried a bite and it had good flavour despite looking dry, and soft texture. Placed on top of some hard bitter melon and some corn on the side.   - BBQ Pork Bun with crispy sweet top (don't know English name of this) - my favorite dim sum, the bun was very soft and the bbq pork was not too overpowering.   Lobster Combo ($55 for 2 people but big enough portion for 4) - comes with steamed lobster (garlic & truffle), lobster congee (so soft and fluffy!) and e-fu noodles topped with abalone slices. No complaints, everything was good.   Sat in the private room, which normally would be quiet unless you happen to sit next to kids watching videos loudly on their phones. Service is ok, food is good - I like the lunch more than dinner."}
{"text":"This place from decor to food hits the mark!  Its very good.  BUT the service, maybe because it is still new but they seem VERY lost.  I came here with my family and made a reservation and front desk said they don't have us in the appointment book.  After much confusion we got our table.  We ordered 16 pounds worth of lobster and they gave us the wrong order it was a plate with around 6 pounds worth of lobster.  My uncle was infuriated and complained to the manager.  After 20 minutes of confusion they realized they gave our order to another table.  They took back the 6 pounds worth or lobster & made a fresh batch for us.  They gave us free pop, which we only drank 2 of the 10 bottles and weren't given the option to take home the remaining.  Hope this place gets more organized, as I will be coming back for the good food."}
{"text":"So we went for a dim sum on Sunday. Got to the place about 12:30. The lady at the front door mentioned that it'll be 10 mins, very rudely..but then it's chinese food place, we dont expect much  niceness. After an hour of wait, our table for 4 was still not ready while we see many people with the same number of people being seated. Apparently there are 2 lists... One where they call for names and those who get a buzzer. Priority is given to the people w names.   We didnt stay. Feel jibbed with the wholr process. Anywhere that needa you to wait for an hour without letting you know that there are 2 lists are never worth it. Be honest about it and stop losing customer"}
{"text":"In search of a seafood restaurant? Yu Seafood might be everything Yu desire! Whether you are going for Dim Sum, or a fancy seafood dinner. Yu Seafood is a fusion of traditional Chinese cuisine with a Japanese twist. The establishment is a more upscale restaurant with an elegant interior and the service is quite superb compared to the usual customer service that you would expect from most Chinese restaurants.They import fresh seafood from Norway, Oysters from both of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Canada, Lobsters from P.E.I. and Snow Crabs from the Pacific Ocean.   During my visit to Yu Seafood, we had Sashimi, Scallop & Shrimp, Snow Pea Leaves with Goji Berries, Beef & Vegetables, Chicken on a bed of Jellyfish, 5LB Lobster, and Fried Rice. The Sashimi dish included Blue Fin Tuna, Salmon, Toro, Snapper with Caviar. The dishes thatbreally impressed me were the Sashimi, which was fresh and melted right in your mouth, the Scallops and Shrimp were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented, and the Beef & Vegetables were delicious and had a beautiful rooster sculpture carved from a carrot. The main dish was definitely the 5LB Lobster which was a tower of deliciousness, and good to the last bite. I will definitely come back for some Dim Sum to see where they match up to other restaurants serving Dim Sum. Until my next adventure, JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner. It was kinda ripped off. In the dinner menu for 2, it says 2.5lb lobsters.  However, we end up getting 2 cutie 1-lb  lobsters. We asked the staff and their excuse was that some customers don't like big lobster because the meat is tough in big lobster. So they change to smaller lobster. What da......??? Not going back again.... doesn't worth it."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night for the fourth time in two months, this time was to celebrate my DW's big birthday.  I ordered a King Crab, Lobster and seafood set menu for 7, plus a beef dish from the dim sum menu for my grandchildren, as they don't eat seafood except fish.   Please see my photos and stars rating.  We have a good time and really enjoyed our dinner.  The foods were great, service was good.  The management was very accommodating to all my special requests, really appreciated it. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who desn't mind paying premium for the good foods, good service and ambience of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Their eel rice noodle roll isn't eel rice noodle roll anymore.  They put Japanese seaweed salad in the noodle roll, and there are only tiny bits of eel.  Very disappointed!!  Lobster and fish congee is bland and lack that creamy texture; both the lobster and fish have no flavor."}
{"text":"This review is for a dinner experience.  TLDR: Good: Everything except the service Bad: Service for this price point  There is a story behind how we ended up at Yu Seafood. We have been avoiding visiting Yu Seafood, because it is expensive. Last weekend we had to take a senior couple to dinner, and they loved seafood.  I called 5 seafood restaurants, and fate as it was that only Yu had a table at a reasonable time.    We ordered a steamed fish, a green bean stir fry, a shredded chicken, and a sweet and sour pork served with ice.  The food was bravo!  The quality of the ingredients were top notch.  The fish was cooked with minimal garnishment, a fit that could only be pulled off with the freshest fish. The beans were tender, yet retained a light crunch.  The chicken was flavoured deep to the bones.  Overall, the flavours of all dishes were just right, hitting that magical balance of delicate yet sufficient.  Nothing was too oily.  The chef really brought his A game.  Great technique and execution.  If you ever want to have a benchmark of good food cooked Cantonese style, Yu can show you.    The service was disappointing for this price point.  Despite having many servers, no one noticed us when we tried to get their attention with eye contact, a subtle wave of hand, or speaking softly.  It always required speaking up and/or interrupting someone's purposeful walk.    A dinner at Yu Seafood isn't cheap.  A steamed fish easily costs $50.  Shellfish costs more.  Yu is more of a special occasion venue than a regular family dinner venue for me.  I do feel the price is justified per quality of food, venue, ambiance.  The chefs deserve a good paycheck, too."}
{"text":"Love this place for satisfying both my seafood and dimsum cravings! The space is beautiful and the reason I do not give it the full 5 stars is the service is not at par with food and atmosphere. We have tried the lobster and crab combos, and everything is always cooked very well. Dimsum is great but a bit on tue pricey side. Also love that they have a seafood market for live seafood, sushi, sashimi, and frozen dimsum. They also have private rooms with automated lazy Susans"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant during the first month that it opened and there was some confusion about our reservation for a party of 12.  Reservations were made but we weren't on their list.  The host at the front was very courteous though and luckily there was an open table which they offered us once the entire party arrived.   The d√©cor here is exquisite and you get to see all the seafood when you are walking through the entrance, which I believe little kids would enjoy looking at if they had to wait for a table.  The plates and bowls are what you'd expect at a new Chinese seafood restaurant like this, new/modern and stamped with the restaurant's name.  They also have sealed tea packets for you to choose from instead of traditional places where they scoop the tea leaves somewhere in the back.  Now down to the food.  We ordered a set dinner which included 2 crabs, 16lbs of lobster, eel, goose feet, sea cucumber, fried rice in shark fin soup, a bottle of white wine and desserts.  Every dish looked presentable and tasted delicious.  The crab was very fresh and the meat was tender, no complaints there.  The lobsters were very flavourful, (I believe it had Maggi sauce, some kind of spicy sauce, topped with fried garlic and tiny salty fish). The eel had the black bean sauce, and the meat on this was tender as expected.  The sea cucumber was my second favourite dish of the night, it was a bit chewy, but not too chewy and had a crunch to it. I'm not a big fan of the goose feet so I skipped that dish, but my family enjoyed it.  Lastly the the fried rice in shark fin soup. I absolutely loved this dish, the broth was light and not overpowering and the rice was cooked to perfection, not too soft and not too hard. The rice had a lighter taste as well and not too salty. The dessert was average, but I'm usually not expecting much for this part of the meal at Chinese restaurants.  At the end of the night the bill was just under $700 with tax and tip for the party of 12 and everyone was satisfied with the meal.  I would definitely recommend people to try this awesome restaurant and I look forward to coming back for the next family gathering (hopefully during Chinese New Years)."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for dim sum over the weekend.  When I first enter, we were welcome by the receptionist and brought us in to the table.  Since we have a large group of friends, we order a lot of food.  The food quality is decent but I would expect more for such a high end restaurant.  The server was polite and did a decent job in clearing out our dish and refill our tea.  We order a rice dumpling but it comes in three pieces with some teriyaki chicken pieces on the side.  I didn't like the way they present this dish.  I was expecting a traditional rice dumpling.  They try to make it look fancy but it didn't taste the way it should be for a rice dumpling.  I would come again but if I have a choice I will go else where."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for my birthday celebration. We reserved a table for 5 at 7:30pm. We got to the restaurant at 7:25pm and was told the table will be ready in 5 mins. But we didnt get seated until 8:15pm, we waited for 45 mins even though we reserved a table !!   We ordered a set dinner with alaskan crab(6 lbs) and lobster (4lbs). The bill came to $500 with tax and tips.  Its a little pricey but its worth it if you enjoy the restaurant decor and the food presentation.   The food was great. The alaskan crab was cooked with 4 different styles. The crab meat was cooked just right, not under or over cooked at all.  The lobster was tender. Other non-seafood dishes were okay.    One thing the restaurant might want to improve on is their service. The servers seemed confused most of the time.  The service was slow. Perhaps the servers are still relatively new.  But i think the servers definitely need more training."}
{"text":"If you are feeling for a fancy breakfast with a twist, Yu Seafood is definitely the place to go to. Fresh dimsum, delicious crispy pastries and lobster are a must here. One of the best places in Markham for breakfast. If you are craving sashimi, they have it here too!   Only complaint was the shark fin soup dumpling as the flavours were lackluster and plain. The texture wasn't very good either. I've had shark fin before (guiltily) and whatever flavours were going in the dumplings definitely wasn't working for it here."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the fancy d√©cor, it is simply a mirage of the horrible customer service you will encounter for the rest of your meal. There is a growing trend in the GTA, try to copy a successful restaurant and then fail miserably.   Entering the restaurant, I was impressed by the nice interior design of the restaurant. It looked high end and judging by the looks alone; I was expecting a level of customer service that would match the d√©cor. Boy was I wrong!  Upon reviewing the menu, I noticed there was no English translation. Not only is this a mandatory requirement for all restaurants in Canada, it made ordering very challenging as I am the person who orders for our group. Our main server told me that I should get my friend to explain it to me, which is very impractical given the size of the menu offering. After we told her it would be illegal to not have an English menu, she sidetracked and told me they had one copy at the front, but she showed zero interest in making the effort to get it to me. If you can't read Chinese, you shouldn't even bother coming here.  We ended up ordering a combo for 5 people that included: Sashimi, King Crab served 3 ways, Lobster, and \"fried\" rice. We decided to upgrade the lobster size by a staggering $21/pound price which is well above market price. Since we are celebrating a special occasion, we were willing to splurge. There was one manager who came by our table when he showed the size of the lobster and king crab, was nowhere to be seen for the rest of the dinner service. This is rather unfortunate because he was very well trained and had the level of service I would expect at a place like this.  When the first dish came out, I was very disappointed. I'm not quite sure why they would include Japanese style sashimi at this restaurant, it  didn't fit the overall flow of the restaurant or the menu. Worst of all, they only included 3 pieces of each variety of sashimi. Why on earth would a combo for 5 people include only 3 pieces of each sashimi? That would mean someone wasn't going to get to try a piece of fish.  The King Crab dishes felt very small and quaint. Despite the fancy dishes and plates that were introduced, the sizing portion felt like a Michelin star restaurant with the service level of an \"afternoon tea snack\" caf√©. There were maybe 10 pieces on each of the King Crab dish.  NOTE: Several reviewers have noticed the same thing. I suspect they do a BAIT and SWITCH. The live lobster and crab they show, is not the same one you get! There is simply no way my 10 pound lobster and 8 pound crab came out so small after cooking. I believe they are SCAMMING customers.  Later on, as more dishes were arriving at our table; our server decided to mix the two king crab into a single plate. One plate is black truffle flavoured and the other is white wine steamed. Naturally this is a bad idea, since one is very strong flavour and other is mild. There were plenty of empty small plates at the service station he could have downsized our dish into. When he asked if it was ok, he was already in the process of combining the two dishes together. Obviously our input did not matter.  The HK style lobster and crab were pretty standard, but lacks the flavour profile and \"wok hay\" that you would get at their main competitor that they are trying to replicate. On top of every dish, they would garnish a stack of 6 inches of lettuce to hide how small each dish really was. Please look at my photos, there's no way the finished product matches the size of the Lobster and King Crab we saw at the beginning of dinner.   I don't think the seafood was that fresh either. Our group had difficulty separating the meat from the shell. Usually when the seafood is really fresh, the meat will just pop right out of the shell with zero hesitation.   The \"fried\" rice was very disappointing, I can only describe this atrocity as Chinese risotto. They pour some type of strange starch corn syrup sauce over the rice. It was disgusting.  Our server was very lazy, he was hiding behind a door while texting on his phone. While we were eating our dessert, he shoved a bill in our face. Two minutes later, while we are still eating our dessert; he flipped the bill open to see if we had paid yet.   Final thoughts, if you want good quality HK style seafood you should go to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse. They are the undisputed #1 heavy weights in this category. Everyone else is trying to open another restaurant with this style of food and it fails to deliver.  After dropping $700 on this meal, I expected better service than the horrific bad mannered staff we had encountered. You don't always need to try the \"newest and latest\", they're just trying to scam you for your hard work earned dollars. With such an expensive meal, is it worth gambling?  D√©cor: 10/10 Service: 1/10 Food: 4/10"}
{"text":"I reviewed this place when it first opened.  It was really good then but wow has it ever dropped in just about every aspect.  The food used to be really special and well made dim sum.  Now, it is average at best and maybe even below average for some dishes (especially the desserts).  The decor is still not bad, but you can see so much wear and tear in the plates, cups etc (lots of chips and dents).  The service is probably the biggest drop.  They used to seem to pride themselves in providing a more high end experience.  Now the service is actually below par.   We ordered a fried rice dish and it was really poorly divided into bowls.  I would say at least half a bowl of rice ended up on the table. I could have done a better job blindfolded.   One particularly annoying thing is when we paid, the waitress counted each dollar (literally down to the dollar) in front of us as if she wanted to make sure we paid or tipped enough.  Really rude.  I used to recommend people to check this place out or even bring out-of-towners here for a special experience, but now I have to recommend to stay away.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Love those dim sum here ...Yum and looks good good good ? Definitely it's a good place and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We came for my husbands birthday dim sum because of the article from the star. We tried a few dishes and I thought they were good, not the most delicious, but presentation was beautiful.  One of the dishes we did not like was the eel rice roll, it was extremely cold. It feels like they took the eel from the frozen package and slapped it on rice noodles.  The pineapple bbq pork buns were delicious.  The charcoal egg yolk had me left desiring more, maybe because the bun part was hard and dense and not light and fluffy as buns should be.  The Malaysian laksa seafood bowl was huge! It had big scallops in it and could definitely feed 2 people itself!  We really enjoyed the flavour of it but it seemed more of a light creamy curry bowl than laksa itself.  Overall, it is a good place to try once, but not a place I would regularly go."}
{"text":"A very nice Chinese restaurant. Cantonese style. I like their dim sum. Very delicate and taste so yummy! Lobster is also very good if you have a group of friends to share."}
{"text":"Don't come to this place!  Rude and limited menu.  Not accommodating to any request.   Wanted to prefer one of the set menu but each time we ask they said it's not available.   We ask what is available, they tried to sell me a gigantic king crab for a family of two adults and two kids.   Stay away!"}
{"text":"Saturday 4:30pm we went to Newly opened Shinta barbecue in the same mall, but was told it was all booked for the night. We passed by Yu Seafood and it was quite empty, we entered the beautifully decorated dinning hall feeling a little uneasy. The menu are mainly for big group ranging from $128 to over $688, we ordered the $128 dinner lobster combo, which was for 2 people, thought it might not be enough for 3 people, but the volumn was very decent and it can feed 3-4 people.  We enjoyed each course, all very tasty, far beyond our expectation.  They also have free tea and dessert, all with good quality.  We will definitely go back to try other dishes soon. I wish there is more set menu for small family 2-3 people. Also one of the plate was broken, our waitress came to table very often to take and change plate. Just one paticular waitress seemed very arrogant. We people proving service can show more smiles."}
{"text":"Our to go place for dimsum and lobsters . Wonderful service , delicious food, great price."}
{"text":"Seafood lover's heaven!   I've come here for dim sum before and now dinner as well and I have 2 very different opinions about that. I'll start with dinner:   DINNER FOOD: THE BOMB! I don't remember what anything is called but the Alaskan king crab leg with egg was amazing (*drools*). I also liked the scallop and shrimp \"appetizer\". Everything overall was so so so delicious, 100% I would come back for dinner.   DIM SUM FOOD: average, not worth the price. Since this place is a \"high end\" dim sum restaurant in the day, they didn't just serve your regular dim sum dishes- they served it with a weird side. Lots of dishes I had came with something a little extra (ex: one dish of meat came with cold, soggy McDonald's fries placed in a small pile)??   PRICE: be prepared to drop some bills  ATMOSPHERE: the decor is beautiful and the restaurant looks so modern. Definitely not your typical Chinese dim sum restaurant.   TLDR: I would come here for dinner and get the Alaskan king crab but pass on dim sum."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day around 8:30pm decore was beautiful not doubt BUT service + food quality + price was terrible."}
{"text":"3.5/5  This restaurant is a case of trying to be too much at once IMO.  Yu Seafood is a mix of a dim sum restaurant, seafood place, and a fish market all at once. It's certainly on the upscale end, and it shows with the price you pay here.  I went here for dim sum on a Sunday afternoon and there was about a 15-20 min wait. Their dim sum menu isn't extensive at all, with items such as curry squid noticeably absent. Some items I ordered include the typical har gow and siu mai, as well as beef balls, omasum, shrimp rice roll, and beef rice rolls.  Nothing really stood out to be honest, both good or bad. It was a passable place with a lot of neat decor and food that's good but nothing to write home about. A little unfortunate given the price paid unfortunately.  The washrooms here are quite unique. It's upstairs and there's a bunch of individual stalls instead of a common gender washroom. Quite similar to Japan if you think of it that way.  Service is, as documented from previous reviews, poor and disorganized. The servers kept forgetting to bring us various items ranging from teapots to chopsticks. Also some servers speak Mandarin and others Cantonese, so you do have to keep an eye if you only speak one of the two languages.  I'll probably not return here unless asked to, there are better dim sum places for the same price (or even lower). Maybe I'll come for dinner though..."}
{"text":"My 3rd dim sum visit since opening... and I'm still not impressed with the food and the service. Maybe I had over expected the quality and taste of the food... since Yu Seafood presented themselves as this 'luxurious' and 'high class' restaurant but their dim sum did not meet this standard. They have limited dim sum - only one column (half side) of the sheet was dim sum and the other side was dessert, fried rice/noodles and entrees (like rack of lambs).   Here are things I DIDN'T ENJOY:  - Lobster seafood steam bun (L): This was extremely overpriced for 3 steam buns since the filling inside hardly had any lobster meat or even taste to it.  - Fresh fruit napoleon (L): It looked pretty, and it came in approximately 3 layers of puff pastry with cream, mini strawberries and sliced kiwi. However, the puff pastry was STALE which is the biggest turnover for this type of dessert (and I even wondered if it was fresh... perhaps a day old?).  - Scallops, egg white, king oyster fried noodles ($18): This is the worst Chinese fried noodles I've ever had! Although the scallops were a good/decent size, it didn't taste fresh with an almost frozen after taste.The noodles have absolutely NO TASTE and should be avoided. It definitely did not match the high price they charged.   Here are things I ENJOYED:  - Special BBQ pork bun (M): This was essentially 3 mini pineapple buns with BBQ pork inside. Overall, the bread was very soft, and it was very unique.  - Steam pork ribs with pumpkin (M): Pork ribs was plentiful! They definitely did not cheap out on the portion, and every pork rib had soft meat. So there weren't pieces that were just bone or fat.   As for service, for my most recent experience, the server did not engage us or even respond to us. When we asked for toothpicks for a table of 5, he gave us only 2 packets of toothpicks. Furthermore, when we ordered the big plate of fried noodles, the servers did not give us bowls to share which is very uncommon for Chinese restaurants. I tried getting someone but no one came, and in the end, I had to get up myself to grab bowls they had on the side. All in all, my most recent experience was a big disappointment and will make me avoid Yu Seafood for a while..."}

{"text":"Limited variety of dim sum with nice presentation but lacks quality, honestly this place looks fancy and all but it just doesn't taste all that good, the beef and shrimp roll were nothing special, lobster steamed bun had no lobster but instead shrimp inside the steam bun which tasted kind of odd, siu mi is meh and I hated the vegetable dumpling even tho it look cute and all....expect it to be a little more pricer than other places and I suggest you skip this place and go to the other places...oh yea they also have a seafood market connected to the restaurant which sells a lot of frozen and fresh seafood"}
{"text":"The food is pretty bland for what you are paying for. The waiter and waitress are rude and incompetent. We waited 30 mins before our first dish came out. I would not recommend anyone to eat here."}
{"text":"First walking into this restaurant I get a sense of modernized style, popular Chinese cuisine and possibly even fusion is to be expected... the only thing that seems true is modernized style.  Coming here for Chinese new year dinner would typically expect higher than usual quality and service since it is for a special occasion meal.  We were family of 4 with reservation so seating was prompt and at a table that was roomy.  Ambiance was very nice with sectioned out tables and warm classic decor.  We already knew what we wanted to order as we were told menus were online when we made reservations a week prior but opening the menu to take another look we noticed there were changes.  This happens sometimes at chinese restaurants so we went through selection again and made our decision.  When the waiter arrived, we gave the list only to be told 1) \"can you order something else?  Crab inventory has not arrived yet.\", 2) \"we don't have this fish but we have another selection if you can change your choice?\" And lastly 3) \"no, the fish has to be fried or cooked with soy sauce, we cannot just steam.  You can make a different selection if you like?\" .  Since my family does not eat sashimi and menu choices seems to have drastically decreased, we were at a bind\" after another 10 mins, luck was on our side and crab inventory arrived so we ended up proceeding with original order.  Food came very fast and freshness was there but it lacked the fresh juicy sea brine of fresh seafood.  We also had oysters and lightly cooked veg and rice.  The oysters were so overcooked and fried that it was a tough chew.  Salt in rice was not mixed well despite the rice was flavoured well.  Lastly, the lightly cooked veg with goji berries.. this was our favourite as it washed out the not so pleasant flavour of the rice.  Through out the dinner, we had a lot of shellfish shells which typically wait staff would either give a waste bowl or change the dishes to give eaters a new dish.  We got neither so it just got messier as we ate.  When we finally finished, the left overs were packed and I think the wait staff was trying to be nice but putting it on the serving table except they dragged it over blocking us from being able to get out of the 'U shaped table'.  Even after getting the bill and paying, they didn't bother coming back to take the receipt out of the debit machine nor thanked us for coming .. they just left!!  Overall, below are my ratings: Ambiance - 5 Food - 2.5 Price - 1 (had better value for bigger portions elsewhere) Service - 1  Lastly, didn't see until I got home while packing away the leftovers.  The elastics binding the lobster and crab claws were still on!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here last summer for a late lunch. The restaurant was very modern. We ordered the lobster and turbot fish lunch set. It came with * Pea Sprouts braised in broth * fried rice noodles with kidney beans and other vegetables * fish congee with fried dough sticks * stir fried fish w/Maggie sauce * stir fried lobster w/crispy garlic  We also ordered a plate of abalone and beef siu mai. The food was decent. Most of the dishes were a bit salty. My family preferred the other place near Pacific mall more.   One plus is that they have single bathrooms on the upper floor and they were really clean."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly service. Clean place. Mostly fresh. They got our lobster order wrong. Place is configured in such a way that there are very few tables, so getting a table for dimsum will be a challenge."}
{"text":"I've tried Yu Seafood a few weeks ago and overall, I thought it was a pleasant experience. The restaurant is split between a typical restaurant with a fresh fish market add-on where customers can pick up fresh seafood including sushi grade sashimi. Pricing for the uni, sashimi, and ready-made sushi packages seemed reasonable and customers can see the sushi chef prepping the packages behind.   On the restaurant side, right when you walk into the restaurant the hostess greets you before you walk through a hallway where there are little windows that showcase the lobsters, crabs etc. Quite an interesting experience!  The ceilings are high and the lighting is nice, clean and modern, which is a great feeling to have when you are enjoying your food. If you have a larger party, then you can book a private closed door room (which has an automatic lazy susan!). If you have a lot of spare cash lying around, you can book the VIP rooms with en suite washrooms!  I mainly tried the dim sum dishes during lunch time, as well as some of the rice and noodle dishes as well. The dim sum is quite unique and different from other places I've tried. Each one has a bit of a special twist on it. Personally, there were multiple dishes I enjoyed (check out the pictures I uploaded!) and I would definitely consider going back and taking my family, albeit that there may a bit of a premium on the pricing of the food. Probably a place I would visit more so on a special occasion. Overall, I felt that this was a worthwhile place to visit!"}
{"text":"It was a nice dinner overall. Got the 2 dinner meal with the beef. The beef was great but the lobster bisque was so salty!and cheese lobster was really good too. Its yeah, a pricey meal combo."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened about a week ago and they offer dimsum as well as massive seafood dinners. There is also a store on the side of the building which wholesales seafood.   We came here tonight as a party of 12 and the bill came to ~$700 after tax and tips.   The restaurant has been completely renovated inside and looks very grand and modern; when you first enter, it looks like a hotel lobby. You then walk through a hall of tanks with crabs, lobsters and other fish before you reach the main dining area. The dining area has many cute circular booth tables and many larger tables for large groups. There are also an additional 5 private rooms that have anywhere from 1 to 3 larger tables..great for privacy but there are a lot of walls everywhere and I almost got lost going to the ladies room.   All of the tableware from spoons to bowls to serving spoons and platters are engraved with the restaurant name.. Quite fancy. They also serve soda in the glass bottles which is a nice touch.   There are four packs of tea leaves laid out at each table for you to pick your tea of choice. For our dinner we ordered a set dinner which included soup to start, sea cucumber with duck feet, eel, 15lb lobster and crab, a bottle of white wine and dessert.   The food was all very delicious but I have some concerns regarding the integrity of this restaurant. Our set dinner included 15lb of lobster (which we were shown prior to cooking.. There were 3) but when our meal came.. It was a small platter of lobster which was probably about 8lb..we brought this to the attention to the manager and he had to bring other staff to evaluate the issue. Turns out we received the wrong serving of lobster and if we never pointed it out, we would have been out half of what we paid for! We were served 4 lobsters in the end (so clearly not the lobsters we were shown).. So I do question whether customers are served what they are shown.   At the end of the night, we were advised that the dessert soup of the night (sesame paste) was all out and they would be compensating us with deep fried glutinous balls (slightly disappointing.. :(.)   I understand that the restaurant is newly opened and quite busy which could stir up much confusion so given that.. I would definitely give this place another chance."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed this place for both their seafood dinners and their dim sum as well. Will be returning sometime soon. They are super busy on the weekends so be sure to make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"One of the nicer dimsum places in town, though a bit overpriced. Everything was freshly made and delicious, though they ran out of a few of their specialty items. It was a bit disappointing, considering I had made reservations just to try them, but the remainder of the food was good. This place noticeably didn't carry a few classic dimsum dishes, or had a few unnecessary twists to traditional dishes (ex: didn't have egg tarts but had a durian tart), which felt odd because of clashing tastes and textures. The food was nice, but the price and selection isn't good enough for me to return, especially since it's very busy and the staff short-tempered (even when reservations have been made in advance)."}
{"text":"This place used to serve great quality of fresh seafood at a reasonable cost...but upon recent visit, not anymore. I personally find that the food you get here...you're able to get similar quality at a more affordable place. We picked a set menu that provided high end seafood for a special friend that came back to Toronto for a visit. However, the dishes quality were inconsistent and have gone down in comparison from previous visit. It's a shame of such great restaurant's quality have dropped, especially when you're paying over $600+ for a meal."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out.. Been waiting for them to finish renovations..  Finally got the chance to try,    The place is renovated for fine dining, however the food wasn't worth the fine dining price.  We had a table of 8, tried the Geo duck, lobster, and king crab combo, it really was nothing special for fine dining... I've been to other places were we ate the same type of food for a cheaper price and bigger portions...  I would say that the fried oyster (separately ordered) was really really good and the fried rice at the end was really really good, those two dishes were the highlight of the evening.. Crab legs and lobsters were just regular Chinese food  We didn't have anything to drink, the bill was $120pp, for that price, you can actually have fine dining downtown... Not just regular Chinese food in a fine dining environment..  All in all, I would not go back, but didn't regret the experience.  Lol, my brother ended up going to McDonald's right after dinner.  My biggest pet peeve, I heard so many things about their fish tank during pre-renos, even in Ottawa I heard about them having problems installing their fish tank, I expected to see a glamourous fish tank, but was so disappointed.. I should just go to Ripleys aquarium next time lol"}
{"text":"My in laws were excited to treat my husband and me to Yu knowing how much we loved fisherman's lobster and crab specials. Foods were tasty, presentations were on point, service was better than standard Chinese restaurants ... Everything was going well until I bit into a plastic piece from the garlic stir fry veggie dish. It was actually sharp and cut into my cheek. Imagine the emergency room visit or the hospital stay I would have to go through if I swallowed that... Or choking hazard for younger kids.. I would like to live a long life and stay healthy. Your foods might be tasty but no thank Yu."}
{"text":"Great good and good service. Good family dinning atmosphere. We got a individual room so no wait was needed but when I arrived I saw so many people line up. I wouldn't personally line up for it as you can make reservations here or other similar restaurants and the good is similar. I do like it more than Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse though."}
{"text":"I was super impressed as soon as we stepped inside. The restaurant was so modern and chic. Was this really a Chinese restaurant? It was just beautiful, as well as very clean.  Was here for dinner and service was top notch 5/5. They were super attentive. We were in a semi private room. It was quiet in the middle of the week and had the entire room to our group. However, the food was a letdown. Most dishes were just average and some things were a bit bland. Thought there was some famous chef here? Maybe it was his day off. I would like to come back for dim sum however."}
{"text":"I have only went for dimsum but never for dinner. This place is always super crowded and it's kind of hard to find parking. I love the interior designs. With all the dimsum I found it a bit over priced and usually I don't mind about the price but for the quality of the food I would've expected it to be better. But one of their dimsum dishes were actually quite scrumptious! I think it's called the number one bun in the world? It's a pineapple crust with bbq pork stuffed inside of the bun! Other than that there's nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"Over priced and food quality is not good. Not worth going again. The plating and the place itself look fancy but the service and the food don't really go well with the price."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated Chinese seafood resturant.  Service is probably considered very good for a Chinese resturant, but the food is just average.  Plating is nice but the flavours lack excitement."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for seafood, although it was really nice restaurant, it was ridiculously expensive compare to other seafood restaurants.    For a dinner for 5 that came with 6lb lobster, 6bs king crab, soup, rice, 1.5lb bass and snow peas leaves, we pay $920 after taxes and gratuity.  The dinner was originally $588 but of course they ran out of 6lbs crab and lobster so we had to pay $130 extra for a 8lbs crab and $30 for a bigger lobster.  We felt hustled. Also, for the same price, you will get a lot more at Fisherman's lobster club house.   The service was above average, not your typical Chinese restaurant however, the manager gave us the wrong order and try deny that he messed up.  He corrected our order but never admit his mistake.   Don't think we will come back here, it not worth the what you are paying for."}
{"text":"Came here 3 months ago for dinner and came back again today and this place is still extremely good and great service from manager Day and his co-worker Sam.  The service was amazing and food came fast and on time. I had 7 people and we ordered the 6 people dinner and fit us perfectly. This place i highly recommend for people and  there family.  I also came on a Sunday night on Canada Thanksgiving weekend and even though this place was a full house everything was up to par.  Thank you very much for the great service and tasty food"}
{"text":"I've finally gotten to have my first Dim Sum experience! What a place to have it, too. Beautiful restaurant, with little portholes on the way in where you can see lobsters and crabs. I really liked that!  Inside are rows of rounded booths which I also loved. For my first Dim Sum experience, I wanted to go in with an open mind and try anything that was put in front of me. I figured, if it's on a menu and people order it, there must be something to it. And I'm glad I did! I tried so many new things, and a few (I'm embarrassed to say) I don't remember what it was, but I'll try to recap. My ultimate favourite, the special bbq pork bun, was something like I've never had before. Sweet and savoury at the same time, it really was the world's best bun! :) Beef rice noodle roll, pork and shrimp crispy spring rolls, mushroom and vegetable dumplings, chickens feet (which I never thought I'd try, less enjoy..!), pork and shrimp shumai, and some cute little deep fried pear-shaped pork dumpling thingys that were just the best! I also had my first congee which I quite enjoyed. I think it was the lobster, clam and fish. To finish, I tried the deep fried durian cake (!!). Surprisingly, it wasn't half bad! Sure, I smelled cat pee for the next half hour coming from nowhere, but I'm still happy I tried it.  I was lucky enough to have wonderful friends to guide me through my first visit, and it was definitely a memorable one! I hope I get to Dim Sum again!"}
{"text":"Although visually impressive, I was not impressed with the food. We had a private room and ordered one of the sets for 12 people. We got a very large lobster and crab, sea cucumbers, abalone, duck feet, sashimi dishes, crab mixed with egg dish and a few other seafood dishes. I was impressed with the decor of the restaurant and size of the food but the taste of some of the dishes just was not there for me. Some of the dishes were good such as the sashimi, sea cucumber, abalone, and fried crab legs. Based on the prices of the dishes, I would think the taste would match."}
{"text":"The worst experience of my life. I've been to many many many restaurants and this is far the worst place I've been to. If you want to ruin your evening or insult anybody you like (fianc√© or friends) invite them there!  The prices are really high, 300-900 dishes... So if you are willing to pay that kind of money you expect a good service, our waitress was really rude and a bit racist, she even asked us if we were \"even able to use chopsticks\"(she said:are you even capable to use chopsticks?) which made me feel a little awkward. The waitress also forced us to order more dishes, and when we said no thanks she insisted.  We couldn't enjoy our food because every time to time the waitress came to ask us if the food \"was excellent\" almost putting her fingers in the dishes (she did that at least 4 times).  We also felt very awkward because she was all over us all the time(we couldn't talk because she stopped us to ask us if the food was good). The quality of the food was not good, even in all you can eat places you can get  better rice and cabbage than here(seriously the quality was really bad). And finally what I didn't like the most is the \"pricing tag\" that they put in our table, like saying \"these people got 1 2 and 3\" and marking them as completed as we get them, I just felt like in an eatery, for such prices I can't understand how disorganized and unprofessional the people were.  Awful experience. I forgot something else, how's it possible that with such prices they don't accept credit? All of the places I've been to (in which I've spent more than 100 per person) accepts credit, that's a must.   I strongly recommend people to stay away of this place. This is far the worst food experience of my life."}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas dinner with my family and I must say I as very disappointed. We had 6 people, so went with the $588 lobster and crab meal for 6 servings. The menu stated the Alaskan King crab is planned for 7 lbs, and the lobster 6 lbs. Turns out the crab ended up being 8.6 lbs, and the lobster was 6.5 lbs - they claimed that it was the smallest they could fine. Keep in mind, the crab was an extra $48 per lb, and the lobster was around an extra $20.  The $588 6 serving meal included: Sashimi platter - there was toro and hamachi so that was interesting. The sashimi was good, fresh.  Alaskan King Crab split in 2 servings.  The big thick legs were steamed in truffle and garlic, served with bean curd egg tofu. Although the legs were topped with truffle and garlic, there wasn't much flavor added to it and tasted slightly bland. The small legs were fried, supposed to be in a chinese \"Bei Fung Tong\" style which is garlic chili but it didn't taste spicy at all. I preferred the flavors from the steamed style. One thing I didn't like was there seemed to be an extra skin layer between the crab meat and shell which was slightly chewy. Not sure if it was like that because the crab was too large, but the other times I've had Alaskan King Crab I've never tasted this part.  Stir Fried Lobster in garlic sauce - the sauce was very thick and slightly too salty. Between the lobster and the crab, lobster was my least favorite. There was a lot of meat in the lobster though.  Steamed sea bass - the fish was served in pieces with all the bones taken out, but some of the bones were not taken out properly so it was was annoying as there were a lot of little bones stuck in each piece. The fish was also slightly overdone and tasteless - completely relied on the soy sauce.   Porridge (rice in soup) made from the King Crab roe. There were a lot of other ingredients such as shrimp and vegetables making the porridge very flavorful. This was one of the better dishes of the night.  For dessert they served a chinese red bean and purple rice sweet soup which was very watered down, wasn't really sweet at all. They also served us a small fruit platter which was ridiculous. It came with a bunch of grapes, 2 pieces of peeled orange and 1 piece of pineapple with part of the skin still stuck on, all which was served on quite a big plate so it looked like leftovers. Looked like a dog's breakfast, what a joke.   This place felt like a rip off. I expected it to be expensive since it seemed to be a more upscale version of \"Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse\" but at that price I would expect to have better service. Understanding it was the Holidays so they were under staffed, but the servers that were working didn't seem to care at all and just kept delegating the task to another server. No one came to change our plates, we had to ask multiple times for people to fill our tea or bring us napkins.  The food ok, but the service was bad and not worth the price. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.    Their washrooms are CLEAN.  Rarely you'd find a Chinese restaurant with clean washrooms.    As I've mentioned in other reviews, you can tell how much the owner cares about their restaurant by looking at the condition of their washrooms.     Their food was very good.  No complaints so far.  1 star off cause they forgot to bring us bowls and other things.    Will update the review when I come back for dinner at a later time."}
{"text":"I was there on the weekend to celebrate birthday with one of my friends.  Anyway to cut the long story short. We did not have a very good dinner. The overall rating is low.  The good thing is that the place is clean, very nicely decorated.   The menu is only in Chinese. There are two menu, one is a la carte, the other one is set menu. There was no clear indication that we cannot order two set per table but the waiter kept on saying we can only order one set.  We had total of 4 adults and 2 young kids, so we ordered a 4 people set plus one extra dish.  The set comes with sashimi, but it's 3 pieces per fish, what the hell, how are we going to divide them among 4 people??   Anyway. They brought the big lobster fresh to let us see before cooking. The menu says it's a 6lb, the one we got is slightly over so we're told that we will be charged a bit more due to the weight.  The food is just ok for the price.  Another thing I did not like is they only accept cash, interac, or unionpay. Come on, this is Canada!! I understand everyone wants to earn money from rich mainland Chinese people but how can a restaurant in Canada that has set menu priced at few hundred bucks not accepting credit card??  This policy also not mentioned in the menu.  I will not return."}
{"text":"I came here for my wife's birthday last week.  This place was located where Wasabi all-you- can-eat was previously.  The interior was pretty nice with high ceilings.  It had a very modern feel to it.  We were a group of 5 so we ordered the Lobster and Sashimi Combo set menu. The star dishes were of course the stir fried lobster with garlic and stir fried dungeness crab.  They were both good but having gone to Fisherman Lobster Crabhouse, I feel they were beaten.  I say this because I felt the lobster and crab seasoning was a bit bland.  The rest of the dishes were alright too but nothing mind blowing.   I feel like I have to mention this but the middle aged woman that served us really didn't seem all that friendly which put a little damper on our eating experience.  Everyone else  we encountered in the restaurant had good customer service even the guy that just brought out our cake.  All in all, if you have a special occasion to celebrate and don't mind blowing a few hundred dollars and are a seafood lover, this place may be it for you.  I would come back in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food with amazing service.  Best seafood ive ever had! We even had a chamce to see the actual lobster before eating it and the one we had waa a 8 lb nova scotia lobster.  The premium dessert was a great ending of our meal."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Elegant setting and atmosphere. Decor screams high end. 2. Dim sum - Only been here twice for dim sum and haven't been disappointed.  There are some unique and elevated dishes to choose from.  Worth it? Prices are not too bad.  A solid lunch can be had for under $20 per person.  I would make this a semi regular dim sum venture."}
{"text":"It took me 1 year to give Yu Seafood's dim sum a second try and I had been back twice already in March. And the experience and food has improved so much that I decided to write an update.  I tried out quite a few items on the menu, not everything was perfect but a big improvement from the nightmarish experience I had last time. Gone was the huge serving plates and sweet/sour sauce in the plating!  Beef Rice Roll (M) ????? - 3/5 Cashew Nut Chicken and Vegetable Dumplings (M) ??????? - 4/5 love the wrappings  Mixed Puff with Pork (M) ????- 4/5 They are just too cute! Mushroom and Vegetable Dumplings (M) ?????? - 2.5/5 Not too much flavour and the wrapping too thick Portugese Egg Tarts (M) ???? - 1/5 just don't order that... Special BBQ Pork Bun (M) ????? - 4.5/5 just as good or better than a year ago: Sweet and Savoury! Steamed Chicken Feet (M)????? - 3/5 OK   Deep Fried Durian Cake (L) ?????- 2/5 usually I love Durian dessert, but the oil that was they used made it tasted stale Mixed Mushroom and Veggie Roll (L) ?????- 2.5/5 Nice presentation but not worth for 2 small rolls Pork and Shrimp Shumai (L) ????? - 3/5 not much flavour and lack texture, no meat juice and no wow Shrimp and Scallops Dumplings (L) ?????- 4/5 so cute! I wish the kitchen would do more dumplings like this Shrimp Dumplings (L)  ?????- 4/5 big bouncy shrimps used for the filling and love the perfect wrappings!  Lobster and Fish Congee (SP) ?????- 5/5 just order this if you are a congee and seafood lover! Almost every table put in an order of congee.  I guess I would be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for dimsum with a group of 11. At first we were given a table in one of the shared rooms in the back of the restaurant, but they moved us to the VIP rooms with the motorized lazy susan (note: the lazy susan has a button to stop it if you can't grab all your food in time)  This place is really nice and looks upscale. Their dimsum isn't ridiculously overpriced, but still definitely a bit more than other places so I would only save this place for special occasions. Some of the dishes will have more creative plating than others (probably check the Yelp photos for ideas). One of the ones that stood out to me was the glutinous rice with chicken! They're usually wrapped in bamboo leaves but they plated them like little finger sandwiches!  The bill came out to about $200 (after tax and tip) for 11 people, which is okay. I would want to come back to try their lunch lobster sets, which they are most known for!"}
{"text":"Yu Seafood has a lot of room for improvement from front line staff to to back end chefs. The atmosphere is great - classy decor with comfortable seating. However, that may be the only remarkable characteristic of this restaurant.   Firstly, the receptionists were poorly managed. We did not receive our waiting number in a timely fashion. Others who arrived after us were seated before us. The wait was atrocious. We waited for almost 1 hour for lunch. Overall, the service felt chaotic.   We ordered the special combo with fish and lobster. The combo consist of Hong Kong \"Tornado Refugee Centre\" Style lobster (5 lb), fish two ways (2 lbs) (fish congee with preserved vegetable, and fired fish with sweet soya sauce), pea shoots in broth, fried doughnut, and stir fry rice noodle with long bean and olive leaf.  The flavour of the dishes were great, the temperature of the food on the other hand, were cold when they arrived. For a lunch that costed $138, it is not acceptable. Chinese food tastes extremely heavy after it is cold or even luke warm. The tea is not refilled even after we had made multiple requests. To put insult on injury, we found hair in our dish.    If you are looking to impress your guests, Yu Seafood is the place to be. Fancy d√©cor, comfortable seating;  if you are seeking for a quality meal, find another restaurant."}
{"text":"What to try?!  The seafood!!  Just like the other seafood restaurants in the markham area, they specialize in seafood. From lobster to crab to shrimp to king crab, they have many different sizes to cater to many different size of parties. They even have a lobster up to 25 lbs so it goes to show how big their lobsters can get. Of course, the bigger the lobster, the juicier the meat. We had lobster and king crab. I liked the presentation of the seafood and the efficiency of the service.   The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the attitude of some of the servers when we were asking questions. She did not provide an adequate answer and chose to ignore the follow up question when I asked why certain items are on the menu when it's sold out for the season. The restaurant should cross it out if it's no longer available or make updates to the menu. While exiting the restaurant, I can also hear the hostess trying to tell the servers to hurry tables meaning to tell them to help customers wrap their dining experience up. I understand there's a seating time limit for dinner but at least say it in a discrete way so your patrons can't hear it.   Food wise, I'll give at least 4 of 5 stars but service wise, I think they can do better.   Last tip?!  For a fancy restaurant like this, they still only accept debit or cash, no credit card. So come prepared if you want to dine here with some cash or debit card ready!"}
{"text":"First experience at Yu Seafood and it was great! The decor of the place was upscale and unique. We ordered around 20 dim sum dishes and had no issues with any of it. The quality of food is well maintained throughout all of the dishes. Service was great and the waitress was patient and understanding of our needs. I've been to a lot of dim sum restaurants and most of the time service is lack-luster. Definitely deserve a visit!"}
{"text":"10/10 wouldn't come again. I came here for dim sum with my friends, they told us the wait was going to be 5-10minutes. The hostess left to do something and came back after 30 minutes. She seated us but it took  us another 20mins to get our tea even tho we constantly asked for it. Most the waiters and waitresses were chatting amongst themselves. The food was good, but not worth the price. They also left out one of our dessert dishes (the tofu pudding), it never came so we decided to cancel on it because we were full but on the bill they charged us. When we tried to explain that we never had the dish and that we  told someone we cancelled the order they denied all of it. They claimed that someone had not only served us the dish but also collected the dish as well. Nothing but a blatant lie. I've had better customer service calling Rogers, come on now......."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and definitely not our last!  The dim sum costs more than most places but the quality and presentation and unique twists on some standard items are delicious and much welcomed after many years of the same 'ol, same 'ol.  The restaurant and decor are also easy on the eyes!  Private rooms are also available for party or special occasions."}
{"text":"If you like fresh seafood - especially oversized king crab or lobster - and you don't mind spending some serious coin to indulge yourself, this is the spot!  We ordered some combo for eight people but upsized the crab. (Someone else did the ordering - I just nodded.)  The steamed fish was good. The service was very good. But the real draw here are the huge crabs and lobsters. Our crab came prepared two different ways - the crab legs were fried and the crab claws were steamed. The lobster was prepared with ginger and green onion. In both cases, the meat was soooooo tender and succulent! And perfect flavour.  (My only complaint is that it's all the way up in Richmond Hill.)  I can't wait to go back though."}
{"text":"I get that Yu Seafood Restaurant is beautifully decorated and the china dishes aren't chipped.  On top of that, there's a seafood market as well.  The menu is not your typical dimsum items.  Many of the dishes are decent sized portions, and they look very pretty.  For the price that you pay for dimsum, there'd better be something special!  The food arrived pretty fast.  Most of the items tasted ok; some were surprisingly bland.  That being said, i am circling back to the dishes.  The bowl in front of me was dirty.  When it got replaced, the second one was also dirty.  Even the associate was embarrassed by the struggle to find clean dishes.    Anyways.  It's definitely a beautiful restaurant, and i am glad i went for the experience."}
{"text":"Late review  Went here for Father's Day dinner.  Atmosphere here is upscale and elegant.    We ordered the set lobster dinner for 4 even though we were a party of 3.   Appetizer of scallop and lobster bisque were good.  Sashimi platter was exceptionally fresh, love the tuna! Lobster was on point and comparable to Fishman Lobsters.  Overall, good ambience and atmosphere.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Food was above average in taste and presentation.  Well definitely come back for special occasions."}
{"text":"Recently visited this restaurant for their dim sum lunch and I have to say their new expanded dim sum menu is definitely worth checking out. In fact, this is one of the better dim sum dining experiences I've had in a long while.   Everything is made fresh every morning, and the presentation of the food is something to admire. Service was too notch - the food came promptly and the waiting staff were attentive- allowing the customer to fully enjoy the dining experience.   If you're still craving some more fresh seafood to take home after after your meal, be sure to check out their in-house seafood market, just steps away from the restaurant and you will find everything from King Crab to Sashimi to full sushi platters. I had a fantastic experience here, and I definitely recommend any dim sum lovers to check it out."}
{"text":"Place was packed busy. But was seated within 2 minutes.  We have the lobster dinner for 4. There was alot of food.  So much we had to take out. Couldn't finish the lobster.  The lobster was 6 1/2 lbs prepared dry. I prefer it to be wet. One of the seacucumber was too small."}
