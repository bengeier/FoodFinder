{"text":"Really good coffee. Odd service: I watched in amazement as the server spent 8 minutes attempting to butter my bagel in such a way that the whole surface area was yellowed while simultaneously using the very least amount of butter possible.

Still. The coffee was so good that I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I hate starbucks for the most part and was dying for coffee so I went in,. Even though I thought it looked interesting I did not want to deal with any snobby artsy attitude you sometimes get for not being a \" regular\", but was really suprised when I didin;t get any of that and a good coffee that had me wired for hrs to come. Its pretty far from where I normally go for coffee but if im ever in the area agin ill ditch MY bad attitude and go in there agin, because its nothing like some of the places ive been into."}
{"text":"Looking for coffee in the Beaches?  Give Starbucks a skip and hit this funky little independent coffee shop.  With its interesting artwork, beautiful reclaimed wood floors and furniture and, yes, good coffee Wunderland is a comfortable spot to catch up with friends or sit and relax alone.  Also, the people that own it could not be much nicer.

One note - CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop!!! Service is always excellent, you'll be greeted with a friendly smile and a little chat when you enter this quaint and quiet cafe/art gallery. A super huge bonus for having organic, fair trade coffee and healthy things to snack on! Also, (an awesome perk) they have agave nectar among the condiments you can put in your beverage!! 

I have never had a bad americano here but it varies in greatness depending on who the barista is. Don't let that deter you! Even though there is a Starbucks but steps away, seek out this Beaches gem; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm refraining from giving this place only 1 star despite my bad experience because when it first opened, I used to pick up coffee there all the time and always enjoyed it. I spend less time in the neighbourhood now so when I stopped in last week, I was feeling pretty nostalgic. I probably should have skipped the re-visit and just cherished the memory because my experience was unbelievably awkward.

As one of the hidden reviewers mentioned - the coffeeshop feels like the owner's living room. There were only 2 seats on the porch that were taken so I sat inside with my drink. What appeared to be the whole family was gathered in the main seating area so I was forced to sit on a tiny couch between two doors. One of the doors led up to what I presume was the family's apartment and they constantly walked in and out, talking and arguing and continually slamming the door right beside me. Not pleasant

Now when I say family, I am not exaggerating. From my best guess, it included the dad, mom, two daughters, the boyfriend of one of the daughters and a friend of the mother's. It was incredibly bizarre and uncomfortable, not to mention pretty unsanitary. I watched as both daughters and the boyfriend wandered around behind the counter, helping themselves to food and drink, sometimes only wearing socks or bare feet. They all talked loudly, crowding around a TV set and discussing the dinner that was upstairs waiting for them,  The daughter and her boyfriend would not stop making out, which after 5 minutes of me sitting there, finally disgusted me enough to get up and leave. 

I have no idea how the cafe is still in business. I can only guess that it dominates the market as it;s the only cafe is that stretch on Queen. Or maybe people genuinely like the over-the-top homey feel. Either way - I won't ever be returning here. I'd take stand-offish hipsters over this any day."}
{"text":"This is a fun little coffee shop that is a great addition to the area. It's a little short on seating, but it's also never very busy.

The hippie owner is happy and friendly.
The hipster barista is gruff and not friendly, (Not UNfriendly, just not FRIENDLY.)

I like this place, but it's not on the same level of Mercury, Manic or Crema, but it's a LOT better than the place down the street that rhymes with Shmarbucks."}
{"text":"Great coffee and cozy atmosphere. You feel like you are up north or in the country. Best Americano in city. Owner is very friendly and you feel like your at Home. It can sometimes be hard to find a seat because it's small. It is none the less worth the trip to the east end without a doubt."}
{"text":"Wunderland is a newly opened cafe/gallery on Queen just east of Woodbine.  It is located on the 1st floor of a house with indoor seating and a small patio on the front yard.  They offer a variety of coffee drinks and teas with a small selection of baked good.  It is a fun quirky little spot.  Do check out the artwork on the bathroom walls."}
{"text":"Cute coffee place with a cute patio. Reminded me of cute little spot I discovered in Thailand. Relaxing chill environment... Can't wait to come back. Owner was friendly too :). I ordered the chilled coffee."}
{"text":"This place has amazing visual appeal but I found the service and coffee below average. We came in on a weekend and ordered just standard drip coffee and a few biscottis to share.  The coffee was quite warm and by the time I put a small amount of milk In it it was basically luke warm coffee. Despite the temperature the coffee was delicious. But our server seemed like she was in a rush and I really expected a friendly welcoming vibe in a place that looked like It was family run.  I would try it again maybe mid day but for now disappointed"}
{"text":"Maybe I should not pick one of the hottest day in the summer to visit Wunderland! 

It was just boiling hot! No Air Conditioning and with all these bugs and flies everywhere.

I really feel like I am in the cottage with all these bugs and the heat... I wish I have some water to cool down... but the lady behind the counter was a little reluctant to give me some ice with water instead asking me to just pour water from an uncovered bottle with fruit and bugs. I ended up getting just 1 cup of water for me and my friend to share after asking a few times!

My coffee is not bad though

But I don't think I would be back. Wunderland though is a cozy place and kind of homey but really not my cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Way down the rabbit hole -- that is, near the corner of Queen East and Woodbine -- is a charming caf√© and art gallery called Wunderland. It's tucked inside an unmissable house painted brown and yellow. There is a small patio out front and inside is a wood-lover's dream. It's covered with barnwood and full of picnic-style benches constructed of large  slabs of darkly-stained wood.

Wunderbar serves up fair-trade organic coffee, smoothies and other typical coffeeshop treats. They also offer something called a Canadiano, which the owner described as \"like an Americano, but made here.\" Brilliant! The drip I had had *just* finished brewing, and I don't think the flavours had enough time to settle. It packed a punch on my tongue, but I definitely enjoyed it. And the prices here are super reasonable.

(Interestingly, like Burger's Priest across the street, this spot is loosely associated with a church. Except in this case it's the very unboring and pro-marijuana Church of the Universe http://www.iamm.com/. I uncovered this tidbit via research though. You won't feel a religious vibe here at all, nor do they proselytize.)

This is a friendly place that is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Don't forget to peek at the artwork adorning the walls (as well as some pieces on the front porch). Neat stuff.

Obligatory Title Pun: It's WUNDERBAR.

Menu Readability: Is it the law that cafe's present their menu on a large chalkboard? Legibility is OK.

Need to mention: Blues on the radio!

What this place teaches me about myself: I think pot and coffee makes more sense than burgers and JC, right? But what do I know."}
