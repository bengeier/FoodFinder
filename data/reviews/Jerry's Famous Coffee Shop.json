{"text":"this is our go-to coffee shop, we always have great service and food. it's always a struggle to pick from our favorite menu items the french dip, club sandwich and cobb salad always with a side of of greek fries. We always save room for desserts we use to always get an eclair which is delicious and now we always get the chocolate cream pie, it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on my way home from the weekend swap meet, and I must say that I'm glad I did! Food tasted fantastic, didn't wait long to be seated and the food came pretty quickly. My 2 reasons for the 4 stars instead of 5... My beans looked like they had been sitting for quite a while, everything was hot but the beans (minor deal). Secondly and more importantly, my $8 Cadillac margarita was way to small. I've spent $6 at other places that were both stronger AND bigger. It was neither strong nor large. Great food though honestly, the steak was cooked perfectly. And the staff is very nice. Was to full for desert but their selection was incredible, easily 30-40 choices and they all looked amazing."}
{"text":"Outstanding is just one word I would use. Good service and the desserts were just excellent. The staff in the coffee shop have each been here for years, which says a lot. our waitress was attentive as well as personable. It's not located in the best part of town, but it's safe enough. This place has been located in this area since 1964. Mob era and if this town was still run by the mob I'm sure we'd have a lot better customer service and way better deals then they have now with the cooperate douchebags of this era. Just go eat there it's that good. 
I promise you you'll enjoy every bite you stick into your mouth."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my boyfriend, usually when we want dessert. Lol the pastries here amazing , the strawberry cheesecake , the German chocolate , Boston cream , and my favorite the eclair. It will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth."}
{"text":"We go there often and have had no complaints except for the fact that the biscuits and gravy didn't have enough gravy. They ended up too dry and we had to order additional gravy on the side but by the time we got it they got cold. 

We absolutely recommend the steak and lobster special. It is delicious and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Had the Prime rib, it was the best I've had in a while. What really made my visit, was the waitress, Cindy. She was extremely friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Jerry's is an institution and has many fond memories for me and my husband. His entire family grew up in Las Vegas, and he has been coming to Jerry's since he was a child. When we started dating, he was excited to share this experience with me, and we have brought both relatives and friends to sample the food. 

Generally when we come, it is for breakfast- I love the breakfast skillets, and the chicken fried steak cannot be beat. I'm also a big fan of the sandwiches and Nachos.

Plus, 5 dollars for a huge slice of homemade cake? You can't beat that.  

Admittedly, it isn't a great area and I do get a little nervous driving through the neighborhood at nighttime, but we have come for dinner once or twice. The Prime Rib is high quality for a price that can't be matched. The soups are also made fresh, and the garlic bread is made daily. It is just hard to find another restaurant at this price point that puts this level of care into their food. 

Two \"secrets\" that I highly recommend taking advantage of: one- if you have a business card, bring it. Jerry's does weekly drawings, and give out 10 (!) $25 gift cards each week to the winners of their business card drawings. 

Number two- ask for a tour of the kitchen! The owner is proud of the operation and the cleanliness of the kitchen, and if you ask, a staff member they will happily show you around. The kitchen area is not only huge, it is immaculate. If you have any doubt that Jerry's runs a clean operation, or makes their own food, ask to see it for yourself. 

So leave your pretensions at home, accept that the casino itself isn't necessarily where you would hang out on a Saturday night, and get ready for some quality food at a great price!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jerry's Cafe for over 20 years for one reason, the carrot cake. Today was no different. At the end of a good meal (always good food) I inquired about taking home a piece of cake. Our server went and checked to make sure there was some available. Sometimes they don't really have certain bakery items which I understand. 
She came back and said they had some so I ordered a piece to take home. We'll to my surprise I opened the box at home to discover it was a piece of SUGAR FREE carrot cake! I have never been so pissed off about this Cafe ever. The server lied and took advantage of me ordering it to go knowing that I would not notice until later. 
Watch out when you go there. You may get servers who sell you what they have not what you ordered and not tell you. By the way the sugar free carrot cake is terrible. Such a bad oily aftertaste I had to brush twice to get the oily taste out. 
I give them 2 stars because their food is good and this is the first time I have been taken advantage of at Jerry's."}
{"text":"We went in tonight and received some of the best customer service I have EVER had. As a former manager of a restaurant, it's important to have that dynamic. William, our server, was one of the most pleasant people I have met in a long time. The food .. Amazing. Atmosphere .. Great. William.. The best! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast on a Saturday morning at 9am. It was pretty empty so I was expecting pretty decent service. I got a simple breakfast and the food was decent, however I was only seen twice by my server, and I waited over 20 minutes to get my check and then another 10 to get my change. I'm a very patient diner but the service here was a real bummer. :("}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out this place since I moved here back in 2007. So, I was finally able to cross it off my list.

The prices were a little higher than I would expect from a coffee shop in this area. The portions definitely do not reflect the pricing & are pretty average. I ordered a Pastrami Reuben & fries. I was a little disappointed to say the least. I guess I was expecting something a little better quality. The pastrami was subpar & was texturally displeasing. I wished I had ordered a burger after seeing some of them being delivered to nearby tables.

Also, prior to sitting down & ordering, I decided to stroll past the dessert cases. Again, I had higher expectations as far as they were concerned. However, most of the pies & cakes looked pretty sad. Some of the pies looked better than others, but a majority did not look very appetizing. Some of the cakes had that disgusting gel/fruit topping & looked really unappealing. After sitting down & ordering & eating, I decided I would take one more lap around the dessert case to see if something jumped out @ me, but to no avail. I finally decided on an ice cream sundae. It was nothing spectacular & they only offer chocolate sauce; no hot fudge. If you want a really good sundae, head over to Du Pars! Hot fudge! 

I'm not too sure if I would come back. I would probably recommend that you try it & form your own opinion. I guess I would come back & try a burger, maybe."}
{"text":"The burgers are fabulous. Favorite is the fire burger. Gyro salad is large and flavorful. But the cakes! The cakes are worth the trip alone. Sour cream cheese cake and the Jerry's Frost are my favorite. Service is excellent and is very diner-like. For a refill on coffee, our waitress actually dumped out the cold stuff before adding fresh. And, my sister and I said we were going to split a cake slice. She cut it in half for us on two seperate plates."}
{"text":"Update on service: When I'm able to call ahead to see if they have prime rib available and they give an honest answer,  I'll raise the stars. Until then,  my opinion of them has diminished. They ALWAYS RUN OUT BY THE EVENING HOURS! MY GOD IT'S THE MOST POPULAR MENU ITEM AND YOU DON'T MAKE ENOUGH AHEAD OF TIME?? I called ahead,  we ordered our food,  ate the salads and appetizer and then the waitress comes out and tells us that they've actually run out... This has never been a problem in the past. 


Old review:

My family and I have been coming here for at least 10 years.

The prime rib is usually excellent and you have the option of ordering it \"blackened\". That option is delectable as well, but can be quite spicy for some...it varies on the spiciness scale. Some days it's hot, other days it's not!

We usually bypass the desserts even though they look tasty spinning around in the front lobby.

The service varies as well. Many of these waiters and waitresses have been here for a looooong time. There has only been one person that has been consistently bad and (if it isn't packed with customers) we request to be seated in some other section if we see that person there. Otherwise, the new and old waitstaff are pretty friendly, efficient, and know the menu items well. Ordering is relatively easy and food usually comes out pretty quickly.

Avoid the place on holidays and you're likely to have the best experience."}
{"text":"We went back to an old haunt for some prime rib and were sorely disappointed with Jerrys.  Wait staff is really nice but the quality has gone down.  Yes the prime rib is probably cheaper than other places but at  $14 the rest has to be up to par.  The salad was OK, out of a bag, chopped veggies.  The potato was starchy, no fluffiness to it at all. The hamburger was no seasoned, blah, but a huge piece of meat and cheese. I agree with another reviewer at the back of the menu there is a list for every surcharge they will add on, they must have taken lessons from the airlines.   I will say that the desert case was a lovely sight to behold and we split a strawberry ring, a cross between strawberry short cake and a cream puff.  My recommendation is come for the desert  but get your mains at another restaurant."}
{"text":"We gamble here every time we're in Vegas but until I read the reviews we'd never eaten in the coffee shop so this time we did.  We had breakfast about 1am one night. I had the chorizo, scrambled eggs & refried beans with tortillas and salsa. It was very good and way too much food. My boyfriend had the Machaca & eggs with the same and he loved it.
For dessert for had the Blacout Cake which was too die for."}
{"text":"the fried zucchini and o-rings were amazing!!! that batter is to DIE FOR!
I had Prime rib which was very pleasing. but the server that we had just made my night. He was very personable and attentive. I wish i could remember his name. I think it was like William...Walter. i'm sure it was a W-name lol. Iono he was a sweet black guy. I'll be back for sure! :]"}
{"text":"The \"Coffee Shop\" is actually a full scale restaurant, and a great one at that.  The food is excellent, the staff is friendly, and the kitchen is super clean.  I have seen it first hand and had a lengthy conversation with the owner.  I was very impressed.  Same goes for Uncle Angelo's Pizza Joint next to the Coffee Shop.  Great meatball subs over there."}
{"text":"the best club sandwich in town! i love the atmosphere of the coffee shop from walking in and seeing the pastries to the rotating cake stand. i always struggle in choosing my dessert because they are all so good! customer service is always spot on."}
{"text":"Came here 10 years ago and again today. I think the prime rib was tastier a decade ago. It is just a coffee shop, however.  Next time I'll try something else off the menu. Waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"Let me say from the moment we saw our waiter (think Thomas Dolby circa Europa and the Pirates) I knew this was going to be special. The menu is all over the place. Mexican. American. Greek. Prices super low. Two of us ordered prime rib in different sizes. Perfectly cooked. I really scored ordering Greek spaghetti, meatballs and the most amazing lemony Greek fries. They were out of the meatballs so I substituted a crazy delicious chopped sirloin. There was so much of it that I actually shared (not something I'm known for) and still had plenty for my selfish self. We all were so happy we spent quite a bit of time handing over heaping forks full of food across the table. The only bad spot was my boyfriend ordered a strip steak that was so dry rabid dogs would have walked across the street to avoid it. He'd ordered it medium well. It was a brick. When we mentioned it to our waiter (best waiter ever) he looked genuinely pained. Here's where the problem came in. The cook had the temerity to say he'd cooked the steak correctly and the manager backed him up. Rather than go all Julia Sugarbaker I let it go. If I have one tip for Jerry's it would be this: if you have a table full of happy people and there's only one problem, fix the problem. This is Vegas it's what we do. Don't tell the customer they're wrong. If that hadn't happened, I'd gladly give this place 5+ stars. I will be back and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a really good, well priced late night meal. Btw, Jerry's has really cleaned up. Good job."}
{"text":"This place sucks the manager Jeremy is lacking a great deal of customer service the food was cold the server was great the manager wasn't at all lacked interpersonal skills in how he delt with me I don't think I'll ever be back here again."}
{"text":"Since moving to Las Vegas in Dec 2013 I've been to Jerry's numerous time and had the best service from a gentleman named William he is a server there and is always on his game not to mention the attention he gives as your server very out standing excellent job William. Not to mention hats off to the chefs that kitchen is by far the cleanest kitchen I've been in here in Vegas and I've been in a lot delivering produce."}
{"text":"By far one of my favy places to come and have a delicious breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert.  Fulfills all my cravings. Very attentive customer service, food always cooked to perfection and very comfy place to enjoy your meal. Just love it."}
{"text":"I've ben eating at this coffee shop since I was a teenager.  Recently I had the opportunity to return for dinner with some out of state family members.  For the price, you cant beat the prime rib dinner here. The deserts are also superb.  I had the tres leche cake and loved it.  The service was excellent as you can clearly tell that many of the wait/bus staff have worked at this same restaurant for decades.  The surrounding neighborhood is sketchy but if you want some local old Las Vegas flavor then this is the spot."}
{"text":"i kid you not.. jerrys nugget is the best , trust me i would not be sitting here waisting time writing a review if it was not true.. what i love about jn is the atmosphere always clean, and the people are great and freindly , well some but i dont go for the people , i can careless , if they act stupid than i can also act stupid.. but the breakfast is always fresh , eggs always hot bacon is made to order not sitting under a dam lamp.. i never have any complaints out of all the upscail hotels. jerrys nugget has the best food.. yes its in the middle of north las vegas but its ok north las vegas police dept. is always there getting there grub on. 247..  but anyway just check it out .. and let me know how you enjoyed it.. bacon &amp; eggs scrambled md soft with chedder , wheat toast and hashbrowns.. yummy 4 yur tummy.. also try the milk cake its the bomb.."}
{"text":"Nice Place, great prices, since it's in North Las Vegas it has it fair share of ghetto customers but the staff at night is great! There late night steak special is only $6.98 and there desserts are better than any hotel and casino even on the strip!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend . My order came out good but my girlfriends plate came out with a little \"extra\" a hair :( we showed the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen . Well to our surprise they brought back the same plate and just removed the hair . I know this cause they brought it back like 2 minutes after she took the plate , Yuck !!!!!!!!! Well least to say she didnt eat it and we shared my burger ."}
{"text":"Went to Jerry's with my wife, Aunt and Uncle. 

The selection was amazing. 

We reach got our own desserts.

Everything was delicious.  Nom, Nom, Nom."}
{"text":"I've been eating BBQ my entire life and I must say, the Baby Back Ribs I had last night at Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop were some of the best I've ever had.  Their sweet yet spicy homemade sauce was generously slathered on a huge rack of pork ribs.  Slow cooked, then finished on the broiler, the meat fell off the bone.  The ribs were accompanied by a healthy portion of potato salad (again homemade) which was light and delicious, not over dressed.  After browsing their amazing dessert selection, I settled on a piece of their Chocolate Mousse Cake.  My god!  Light, fluffy chocolate cake, layered with creamy chocolate mousse filling.  And if I didn't eat enough, I took an eclair home for later.  This place is a homestead in the Vegas Valley.  If you haven't experienced it, I suggest you do.  Its phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  It's the ultimate late dinner hangout.  It is well worth the drive for the strip.  Their menu is gigantic and the food is delicious and cheap.  Their servers are friendly and really attentive without being obtrusive.  I didn't go in the casino but everyone looked like they were having fun and it seemed really relaxed.  This place is super family friendly and the booths are big.  It has cute decor and it's bakery section looks yummy although I didn't try anything from there this trip."}
{"text":"The food was good and there was nothing \"wrong\" with the place.  But it wasn't special either, so I didn't give it more stars. Even though it is part of a casino the setting was reminiscent of an old time stand-alone diner; which in way was a plus. But there was also a bit of confusion in getting our order put together and to the table.  Our coffee was served by one of the bus-people and taking our order had to wait until the waitress was free.  The staff was friendly and courteous despite the timing appearing to be off somewhat.  Perhaps they were short handed.  

My wife had the steak and eggs, which came with hash browns and toast.  The steak was good but she had ordered it \"medium\" and it came \"well done.\" If you order a steak, make sure that you are on the same page with the restaurant on what you can expect from their various levels of done.  Otherwise, she did enjoy her breakfast.  I ordered the build-it-yourself omelet.  I probably got carried away picking add-ons because it turned out to be quite a large amount of food, especially since it was served with hash browns.  If I had that to do over, I would have omitted at least one of the cheese selections.  But it was very good and quite the complete meal.  The food for the price value is quite good.  

Fortunately we both broke even at the slots, so there wasn't a premium for eating at a casino captured restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. So Friday night my family and I went here for dinner. My grandparents have been going to Jerry's for the prime rib for decades (literally). However this day was the worst service we have ever received. After the drive in plus sightseeing  we were hungry. When I got my food it was disgusting. I ordered the 3 item Mexican combination plate. I normally order this. But like I said disgusting. Rice was cold, the beans were canned, old and dried out. The burrito was not wrapped and small. Enchilada was disappointing it was cold and canned sauce. Chile relleno was a treasure hunt to find the cheese in. My aunt ordered the steak, as did my mother and husband. My aunt's steak was over cooked and had too much fat left on. Waitress was nowhere to be found so we all ate whatever we could stomach. After 10+ hours on the road cold yuck food was better than nothing. We told her about our experience expecting her to apologize. She didn't do that. She just said, \"We'll why did you eat it? You're going to pay for it anyway.\" We said we weren't complaining in order to receive a discount or anything just so they knew our opinion. She called the manager who came out and acted like an butt hole. He didn't care and told us the steaks have a little fat on them even though we showed him the big chunks of fat. He said we should have complained when the food was brought out, which we should have but after all the waiting forget that we were hungry. Also my husband, grandma, and aunt ordered hot tea. The got lukewarm water and a tea bag. We asked several times for HOT water but it was only lukewarm. Horrible. Plus the server kept getting upset when we'd ask for more hot water.

Sadly we won't be going back the quality of food has gone down."}
{"text":"I never have written a review I belive in giving them a second chance but afte eating in the cafe tonight served cold prime rib two times and the server just walk away when she came back with a manager who had a very.bad attitude about taken care of the problem. His answer was we will just charge for the.potatoe I pick at while waiting and salad. When I told shouldnt have to pay for the potatoe but.only salad because it did it he said sorry was charge for.potatoe. bad service by sever and then manager. Being manager myself I was very disappointed in his training he must recived. Been here many time with family and friends and always enjoy. I will not be back if there food standards are to service sit out food sorry I can not afford to get food poisoning. Ver bad.management."}
{"text":"My family and I went here after church for lunch and the food and service were excellent! Much brighter and cleaner than I remember from my childhood, the food is the same.  Service was friendly and MaryAnne took great care of us. 

Desserts are ridiculous good and large! Same pies and cakes!"}
{"text":"First time here in years. Classic coffee shop. Extensive menu. I had the double cut prime rib, 30 ounces, for $28 and Fowler had a rack of bbq ribs for $20. Enough for two meals."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas for 35 years, but for some reason, never ate there. Until tonight. My girlfriend, my daughter, and I, were seated relatively quickly, despite a very busy Friday night. 

The shrimp cocktail, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks, were large and very good.

The chicken sandwich was very good, the prime rib was excellent, as was the New York strip. Service was prompt and friendly. 

Cost was inexpensive, particularly in light of huge portion sizes. They must go through a LOT of doggie bags!

A common error in many restaurants is incorrect meat temperature. Here they got medium and medium well perfect.

No hint of frozen foods. Everything tasted very fresh. The veggies were a bit under-seasoned, but easily corrected at the table with salt and pepper.

Desserts are insane. Huge, fresh, awesome. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"You gotta love Vegas. My boss and I went to eat at Jerry's Nugget today, and the guy across from us was consuming a huge prime rib. 

For lunch.

Yes, Jerry's is known for its prime rib, but it's equally famous for its desserts. I'm not a prime rib person, so I skipped the big slab of meat. And I'm usually not a dessert person, but I decided to splurge today. I had a piece of chocolate cream pie, which wasn't that tasty, to tell the truth. My boss fared better with his strawberry shortcake, and he also grabbed our co-workers two pieces of cheesecake, which were well received. 

Although I wasn't a big fan of my pie, I was a huge fan of my entree. I got the keftedes (Greek meatballs), which were perfectly seasoned and served with a side of Greek spaghetti, feta cheese, olives/cukes/tomatoes, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce. A ton of food for a reasonable price. My boss had some sort of chicken sandwich that he was pleased with, too.

Jerry's Nugget is close to my workplace, so it's surprising that I don't go there more often. (In fact, this was the first time I'd been there in years.) But the keftedes were so tasty that I see myself returning again soon. And maybe next time I'll have better luck with my dessert choice. (Blueberry pie, anyone?)"}
{"text":"I first came here in the late 80's. Prime rib, fish , it's all good. A refreshing break from the insanity of the strip. Of course we being somewhat insane ourselves ordered the 40+ oz prime rib for our first timer friend. It was a great night! It's all still good. Staff is great! Outstanding value and so easy to just be here. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding service was even better. Highly recomended. We had the steak and lobster for 9.89 and it was very good. Jill was our waitress and she was great"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast this morning with the family simple breakfast we had Adriana as our server I recommend this lady to anybody."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 11 people and they had a couple of servers take care of us. They were courteous and made sure our food was to our liking and out drinks were never empty. If
Your looking for 5 star zagat rated  dinner your at the wrong place but you want a good meal that does not  break the bank this is the place."}
{"text":"This place does the bait an switch, they didn't have the surf and turf, but a steak with small amount of crab for 10 bucks thats not filling, than they charge you $2 dollars for soda. Its a ripoff, better to go to Ellis Island if you want a real food deal."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not even sure what rating to give Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop.  I'm not going to lie, their food is decent and their mozzarella sticks are pretty damn delicious!  But the experience I had there about a week ago was a little disturbing. 

My family and I decided to go have breakfast prior to catching a movie and chose Jerry's.  We ordered and got our drinks quickly, but the waitress we got was pretty bad.  Right off the bat, she seemed nervous to take our order.  We figured she was new, but the woman was literally shaking.  She was very nice, but again, was so nervous that it made us a little uncomfortable- she was just taking our appetizer order, after all. We were being polite to her- so there was no reason for her to have looked so shaken up.  So anyways, we order our appetizer and she forgets the plates. No big deal- she went to get them, but it literally took this woman about ten minutes.  Again, we let it slide, whatever.  So she takes our actual order once she gets back with our plates, still seemingly nervous, but the ordering of our food went semi-smoothly.

We waited... and waited... and waited... and I kid you not, it took about forty-five minutes for us to get our food.  Pretty ridiculous especially when you have to wait with moody and hungry kids. Once we got our food, the order was totally wrong.  My husband ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and somehow was handed this HUGE plate of barbecue ribs.  We were also given an additional breakfast we didn't order.  So we asked her to leave the extra breakfast so my husband would have something to eat since we were all on a tight schedule and would have to leave soon.

If that weren't enough, ten minutes into us eating- I hear this little scream coming from both of my kids.  They pointed towards me which made me look back-- and what do I see? An effing cockroach!  Safe to say, that alone took ALL of our appetites away.  This was also enough for my husband.  He told the manager about our experience, he pointed out the cockroach- and didn't make a big deal about it, considering he didn't want to disturb everyone else's experience.  Granted, the manager was very apologetic and \"took care of us\" by not charging us for the drinks and the barbecue ribs we didn't eat nor order.  Woah.

Let me make it clear that we didn't care whether she \"hooked it up\" or not, but this experience changed how I feel about Jerry's- cause everyone knows, where there is ONE roach, there are THOUSANDS!  Gross!  Which is why I don't think we will ever be going back. 

Farewell awesome mozzarella sticks!"}
{"text":"Location and ambiance sucks, but you can't beat the prices for some good quality prime rib!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 4 on a good night.

My family has been going here since the casino opened and we've been through all the changes. They're celebrating their 45 year anniversary. I can tell you my family has been here that entire time enjoying Jerry's.

My grandparents gamble and eat here EVERY SINGLE DAY. They will do so as long as they're here on this earth.

The specials are usually pretty good. I had the 6 oz Lobster tail meal and added a steak for $2. It's a thin cut steak, but not horrible. Last month I had the pound of crab for the same price. Lots of meat. They don't buy the horrible crab that you'd find at some cheap asian buffet.

I have ALWAYS been a huge fan of their salads.
I recommend the creamy italian dressing. It is my favorite. I'd buy a gallon if I could. They just switched to smaller croutons, which are actually perfect and yummy.
The nachos are also excellent. Cheese overload & edible sour cream and guacamole dishes.

My complaints are:
They now charge for EVERYTHING. Want some diced onions for your salad? $1 for each little monkey dish. Extra ranch? $1.50. Mushrooms added on your steak? $2.50. They don't really give paper napkins, but I bet they'll probably start charging for those soon, too.
It was all on the bill.
I was surprised there wasn't an itemization saying, \"Wiped down table in the middle of meal - $2.50.\"
No more free cake on your birthday.
Also, I was eating with 2 diabetics and they ordered DIET COKES. They got the sodas and they were not diet. So they asked the guy to check the soda bag and get them a DIET. Came back...still regular coke. ANOTHER guy went to another soda machine and came back with diets. They were much, much darker. A lot of older folks and diabetics eat here and I hope they didn't have the same problem.

Also, sodas are $2. I think that's pretty expensive.

The decor is rather nice. The booths are comfy, the food is usually decent and priced well (particularly the specials). You can never go wrong with a salad here."}

After 10 minutes of waiting with their buzzer  we went to the counter..still NO service not even a glass of water about 15 minutes later we walked out. Stopped by and told the kitchen manager of the bad customer service and all he said was \"sorry but we're short staffed\" never offered to  take care of us or anything. Jerry's has lost a couple of old long time locals that have been going there since the 60's..
We went down the street to Silver Nugget and got right in and taken care of promptly."}
{"text":"We've been looking for an amazing prime rib restaurant for the past year in Vegas. We wish we would've came across this place sooner! What a hidden gem! We both got the prime rib, and were pleasantly surprised with how good the meat was. If you're from the South Jersey area, it brought us back to The Pub."}

{"text":"BF and I came here after one of his coworkers raved about how great this place is.  Menu is massive, with classic diner specials as well as a huge case of desserts and a random section of Greek dishes. The huevos rancheros was okay, and my guy was thrilled that they had the prime rib dinner special available at 10AM. Miraculously, we resisted the sweets. Portions were large and prices were fairly low, about $30 for both of us, including tip.

Service was okay. Hostess/cashier was slow, server was efficient but brusque. Food was better than expected, but not something I'd come back for. 

Note: This is your only on-site dining option before noon, unless you want popcorn and ice cream from the snack bar."}

{"text":"Old school since 1964. We came here to get some good breakfast and that's what we ended up with. It was Sunday and only a few people were in line and it was obvious a restaurant worker did not show up. The cashier was doing double duty by being the hostess also. I ordered my favorite Vegas breakfast dish which is Steak & eggs, hashbrowns, and sourdough toast. We only waited around 10 minutes to get our food and it was spot on, good service and good food. I love eating at old school restaurants, there is a reason why they've stayed in business for decades, quality food and service."}
{"text":"For a Las Vegas casino coffee shop this place was pretty decent the food was outstanding I would definitely go there again it was off the strip away but the food was very good and the service was good"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to get prime rib. We always shared it with others as the place locals go and you have to get over the run down look outside because when you go to the coffee shop you are going to get a good meal. Today they made a liar out of me. I started with their clam chowder that had so much grease in it I couldn't finish it. Then the prime rib was tough and so was the steak my husband got. And if that wasn't bad enough, apparently you have to be a regular customer to get good and friendly service. Our waitress stopped by the tables next to us multiple times and their drinks always stayed filled. My husband's soda was filled once, but my water glass stayed empty for at least 10 minutes before I finally flagged someone down to fill it. He also brought us a box for our leftover food. We had to flag down our waitress and ask for our check. We had discussed dessert, but gave up the thought when we realized it wasn't even going to be offered. Once we asked for the check, she quickly gave it to us and wished us a good day. When we approached the register, one cashier was counting her till and the other said she would help us and asked for our check. She quickly processed our check and wished us a good day barely looking up from the register and never looking at our faces. When she handed the receipt to us with one hand, she was taking the check from the next customers with the other hand. It was clear that good food and good service are no longer a priority. I guess it is time to find a new and better place for the locals."}
{"text":"One of my pet peeves is when the servers forget to refill my drink for a while but it didnt really bother me as much today. 

The servers were very nice and my burgers was great for the price. I had the Firealarm burger which  was not spicy. My friends had the Habanero salsa and i can honestly  say it is one of the best salsas i have ever tried, \"just lile a mama used ta make!\"

I recommend this cheap, nice cafe and perhaps an after dinner drink at locally owned bar \"Chicas Bonitas\", which my friends say is all the rave right now."}
{"text":"Bang for your bucks for sure. It was 3 pm and I craved for prime ribs and this place is the only place that is open at the time, so we decided to give it a try. Quick service. The prime ribs is good, not as exceptional as House of Prime Ribs in SF but good and very good price for your bucks. $27 for a thick cut 28-30 oz prime rib. And it is very juicy."}
{"text":"Food was two stars. I got the Greek omelette which featured large blocks of feta cheese that had neither the taste nor consistency of anything approaching cheese. I had to douse the thing with hot sauce to taste much of anything. Toast was overly buttery, I don't know why diners feel the need to do this so often. A lot of items on the menu were super overpriced. My companions similarly complained about the food and it made us all feel gastrointestinally displeased.

Service was four stars. Refills on the orange juice plus consistent and responsive servers. Being that this was off the strip, I didn't expect top notch quality, but the wait staff prevented this place was from being pure oblivion.

Two star food and four star service averages out to three stars...right?"}
{"text":"On your way to or from Valley of Fire, here's what you do.  Stop at Jerry's Nugget, enjoy that vintage casino vibe as you find the Coffee Shop, take a table as far from the cigarette smoke as possible, order coffee, a stack of pancakes and a piece of banana cream pie, smear that pie all over your pancakes, dump syrup over the whole thing and thank me after."}
{"text":"Our hotel front desk person recommended this place - glad we went. Prime rib dinner was excellent. Casino and bathrooms were clean. It's just a little north of downtown."}
{"text":"Due to the amazing customer service we received after our last visit, we decided to give Jerry's another shot, and we're so happy we did.  Ordered the double cut prime rib, and OMG!  Seasoned well (but not overwhelming), that was one amazing cut of meat.  48oz for $41 was a steal, especially considering you got salad, bread and a side to go along with it.  My wife and I split it and were pretty full, but feeling a little ashamed of ourselves for eating nearly a full cow.  So we topped off our meal with one of the incredible eclairs we saw when we walked in.  It was huge, and nearly as good as the steak.  Our waitress was funny and on top of everything - this is the kind of gem I was looking for in Vegas.  Definitely a place I'll tell my friends about, and we'll be back for sure.  Ready for another full cow :-)"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Jerry's! My uncle had been telling me about the huge 48oz prime rib before my recent visit.
I came in thinking it was odd that this was the place that served the world famous prime rib; it's a cafe, not a steakhouse!
Our waitress was pretty enthusiastic and friendly. My uncle got the 20+oz prime rib, while I got the 48oz. 
We got our drinks rather quickly and got the soup of the day. It was probably a bad idea to drink all the soup considering I had a 48oz prime rib coming.
The prime rib was huge, and cooked beautifully. It was cooked consistently all around. While I was eating, the meat began to absorb all of the au jus around it  it did eventually get dry, but I still enjoyed the taste 
Unfortunately even after chopping off all of the fat, I was only able to finish half, but I boxed it up and took the rest back to my hotel to eat later.
I do want to give it another try in the future and will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the worst service here. The manager is so rude. My mother in law didn't like the prime rib it was raw so she asked for it to be cooked longer. And it came back just as raw and didn't seem to be cooked any longer so she asked if she could trade it. Manager came over and said no because she cut it and he said since she cut into it he couldn't resale it and would have to throw it away. Like what? You would have resold it!? And he didn't have any sympathy that they didn't cook her steak to her liking. He just left and we paid for her full meal and all she ate was the corn. Plus way too much cheese in the quesadilla and too much fat on the small steaks. The server was the only good thing about the place she tried to help but was out of her control. Would never eat here again or recommend it to family or friends."}
{"text":"Salad is delicious with the bleu cheese dressing. this is the primary reason for my frequent visits. 

Customer Service is outstanding, and very knowledgable about the menu. They make you feel welcomed.

Food selection is great. I love to order from the selection of desserts (which is a ton of pies, and cakes).

Prime Rib is amazing, Fire House Burger is amazing, and the salad with bleu cheese dressing is amazing.

I really wish there was more to say, but to me, this place is perfect. HOWEVER, the only reason why its not 5 stars is because they took out the best steak and lobster deal for $9.89!!! This is ridiculous! During that era of steak and lobster deliciousness, the place was always packed because of the steak and lobster. It was worth the 20-30 min wait, sometimes less."}
{"text":"Very good tasty food and a good price I go here a lot ever since I was a little boy my grandfather can't stop gambling at this casino you always take his food from this place very tasty as I said + is across the street from my house so I have no complaint with it"}
{"text":"Ok I like this place. It isn't \"fall out the chair\" amazing but there is something about it's charm. It is located inside the casino, Jerry's Nugget as soon as you walk in, to the right. It's a friendly diner reminiscent of the TV ones where there isn't much chatter but someone is being called by their first name and a waitress smiling in a distance because she's been there forever. Ok so maybe I go for the atmosphere. Big selection in an all day format, low variety if you are on a special diet. Get the cheese sticks, they are worth it!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at Jerry's Famous Coffee shop and after daily visits with my gramps i can easily say that the food and service at Jerry's goes almost unmatched through out the city. My gramps has been a regular for 30+ years and can not stand to eat anywhere else and it took me a while to understand as i weened myself off junk food, after about a year of Jerry's food i began to feel a lot better and even lost a good amount of weight eating their healthy options. Though they do have healthy food, i can also easily get stuck on their pancakes and other sweets. It can get quite crowded and sometimes the wait can be long, but it is most often worth the wait.  Also if you have a chance to try Jerry's Lobster Benedict, DO IT. Best eggs Benedict dish i have ever had, as long as they do not forget the avocado :]"}
{"text":"Second time here! Came here again for the prime rib! If you don't want to spend a whole lot and get more bang for your buck, i would recommend this place! It definitely further out but I feel its worth it! The prime rib was tender and not over cooked. All dishes came out HOT! Service was good! The waitress we had was the same one I had the first time i came and shes great! Shes on top of things and comes back and checks on you frequently to make sure all dishes are up to taste and etc."}
{"text":"This place has a cheap and good resturant. Especially for breakfast. It's not pretty but the food is surprisingly good.

The breakfast burrito was killer.

It's just off the strip.

You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Prime rib was excellent again. Service amazing. Son in law ordered his prime rib lightly blackened and it was amazing. I will do that next time. He ordered his salad mexican style and it looked good too. We were full and took dessert to go. Peanut butter pie and black Forrest cake were great."}
{"text":"There are some things I only do in Las Vegas.  Like, ordering Steak and Eggs, for example.

While I never order it in real life, I always do in Vegas.  And almost never for breakfast; Steak and Eggs is the way I end my day.  

I was at the end of a casino crawl through North Las Vegas, I rolled into Jerry's around 1:30 am.  It was the end of my Wednesday, but it was already Thursday morning on my phone.  And I was much too drunk to argue with my phone

Although it has been remodeled since the last time I visited, the coffee shop here is a blast from the past.  The booths are really comfortable, and they're really tall, so, you know, no one can see if you're carrying on.  So, yeah.

Let's talk customer service for a minute.  My waitress, Sherry, was outstanding.  She's been working at Jerry's for seven years and she's seen it all, and boy is it fun to listen to her talk about it!  It wasn't that busy, so whenever she walked by she'd stop and chat.  I'll admit, I was already in a pretty good mood, but she seriously cracked me up.  

Back in the early 90's, when the internet was still a baby, Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop was already really famous.  This place had a huge buzz.  Everybody knew this is the place to come for a Prime Rib special.  They still have a special Prime Rib deal, but I think it is limited to just Friday and Saturday night (it's all spelled out on the menu, but the menu was almost impossible to read because the words were moving around on the page).

No prime rib for me, I needed a Steak and Eggs.  A good steak and eggs.  The previous night I had the sh$ttiest steak and eggs ever at Ellis Island.  I was looking for the magic.  Would Jerry's come through?

I ordered my steak rare and my eggs poached soft.  For toast, I went with sourdough, and I asked Sherry to make sure it was burnt.  I like my toast dark.  As in black.  I crave burnt toast.

Most of the time my request for burnt toast falls on deaf ears.  Rarely do I get it my way.  It takes a really good waitress to make it happen.  Like Sherry.

The whole damn breakfast was great.  The steak was cooked perfectly, as were my eggs.  I like my hash browns crispy, and even though I didn't specifically ask for them to be cooked that way, that's how they came.  I totally get off on breaking the yolk of an egg on a bed of crispy hash browns.  So, yeah, I was digging this breakfast in a major way.

Before my food came out, Sherry asked if I'd like steak sauce.  Hell yes I'd like steak sauce!  How about A1, Sherry asks. Yes.  How about some Heinz 57?

Whoa.  Heinz 57.  I've been hearing about Heinz 57 all my damn life, but somehow I've never actually had a bottle in front of me.  Yeah, gimme some of that!  I loved it.  Still prefer A1, but it was fun to try something new.  Thanks, Sherry!

Such a fun visit to Jerry's Famous.  Good meal, great waitress, plenty of laughs.  By the time I finished everything I was totally sober enough to make it back to my hotel.  It was a good day.

Mikey C says: I'm always on the Jerry side, except when I'm on the Phil side."}
{"text":"Don't under estimate this place because of where it's at Service & food stomps anything strip can offer and 1/4 of the price Everything right down to the cleanliness is on point from the minute you pull into the property Will definitely be back before we go anywheres else"}
{"text":"Their Clam Chowder is the best I've ever had! Chock full of clams, and the overall taste and texture is to die for! Mexican Salad is always our favorite salad and we order this every time we're there."}
{"text":"Well for what this place is. 5 stars all the way! All fresh ingredients! I had a ham, spinach, and cheese omlete. Soooooooo tasty. My honey had steak and eggs. His steak had allot of gristle. But he like it. He had homefries (that i kept picking off his plate) they are hone made and get this actually tasted like papatoes. My hashbrowns were so good and again tasted like patatoes. Im very happy. Just wish they had some discounted specials for locals. Other than that yummo."}
{"text":"For a old Skool \"Mom & Pop\" local casino it has the best food in town. Been coming here for 22 years and never disappointed. I say the closest thing to fine dining for a local neighborhood casino restaurant that would very well rival most of the Strip Casinos."}
{"text":"Not the worst experience I've ever had, but just OK. We all came here for the prime rib because it was rated pretty highly, so this review is just for the food only, not the casino itself. 

The dining area was pretty empty when we came in around midnight with only 2 other tables occupied at the time. So we were pretty surprised after being seated for almost 10 minutes and no server came by. One of our party went up to the counter to see about our server when she came out to our table and apologized for our wait saying no one had told her we had arrived. Okay...

We all ordered pretty much the same thing (prime rib) and we all got it with varying side dishes but had to settle for medium rare since there was no rare left at that time of the night. The rib was juicy and tasty and I found no issue with it at all, but I feel quality could have been better. I still got my red meat, so craving was satisfied. The complimentary buttered bread had waaay too much butter on it. I'm talking slathered on so much that I had an upset stomach later that night that needed a dose of ginger ale to cure it. 

All in all, it was just an OK experience. I'm still on the lookout for a prime rib joint with reasonable prices. Prices here are okay depending on the size of the prime rib you order, but in no way could I justify paying that much for a mediocre meal. Like I said, just okay."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there. The 9.50 steak & lobster was great. The desserts were good to. My date had the prime rib & huge salad. Good value & quality. Uri was a great server also."}
{"text":"The current 24-hour special $7.89 dinner is half a pound each of steak and king crab legs with soup or salad, choice of potato, and bread or garlic bread. You can also choose a pound of king crab legs for $9.89. Both dinners are delicious, a super deal with excellent service in a very pleasant restaurant. 

We had the homemade soup both times -- vegetable soup with a tantalizing broth and creamy clam chowder, both delicious. The steaks were excellent strip steaks cooked just as we ordered them, tender, and really tasty. The crab was outstanding. The baked potatoes were large and done to perfection. We were amazed, agreeing that a person doesn't realize how different potatoes can be until eating really good ones like these. The excellent garlic bread was crisp and buttery with a touch of salt on the crust.

Jerry's does all its own desserts, and the bakery case was extremely tempting. We had no room for dessert but certainly would have liked to try their beautifully presented version of strawberry shortcake or any of their delectable looking creations.

Jerry's Nugget is about 12 blocks north of downtown on Las Vegas Blvd. It is easy to get to and definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the finest diner that I know.  I first came to Las Vegas in 1994 but my first visit to Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop was in 2004 and I enjoyed the aged decor.  It was newly redecorated in 2008 which updated the look while keeping the 60's feel.  I just wish that I had visited here sooner.

The first thing you see is the desert case full of homemade desserts with special mention to the famous strawberry ring.

The servings are huge so be careful, any of these plates are good for sharing.  I love the machaca and eggs for breakfast, also nice homemade biscuits are a good choice.  My dinner highlight is a perfectly cooked prime rib, complete with the coloured plastic steer indicating the doneness of the meat.

The wait staff are extremely competent diner servers. I am always impressed with the professionalism and enthusiasm of the coffee shop staff.  Every restaurant should strive to serve like this staff.

Jerry's is usually my first meal when I come to town and I hope it remains a tradition for many years to come."}
{"text":"Not the kind of place where you come for service. Just the affordable and delicious prime rib. But... the service is in fact always great. Looks like the server Misty was training. She's doing a great job. Give her a raise."}
{"text":"Pretty diverse menu. About the only thing I've been disappointed with here is the prime rib. Not a deal breaker, just haven't ordered it again. Great sandwiches and decent salads. Thick cut steak fries, but they're pretty stingy with them. Lots of rich desserts too. Great haunt for late night meals."}
{"text":"I was recently telling a friend of mine about Lawry's The Prime Rib and how good it was.  And he said the best he ever had was at Jerry's Nugget.  I'd never heard of the place, but I met him there for dinner one night.  When I drove into the neighborhood, I thought I'd taken the wrong direction.  It is not in a good neighborhood at all, in North Las Vegas.  Needless to say, when I pulled up in the parking lot, I was beyond skeptical.  I walked in and it was basically a dump with rather seedy looking clientele.  However, when I walked in the coffee shop, I was quite surprised.  The food looked incredible.  And it smelled great.  I ordered the Prime Rib.  They had three sizes.  I got the small one, and my friend got the medium sized one.  The small one was enough for me.  The medium sized one looked like the size of one served on The Flintstones.  It was HUGE!  I could have eaten four meals off of it.  But it was definitely top notch prime rib.  The service was ok.  They weren't overly friendly.  But I definitely love their food.  And the menu is huge.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Jerry's coffee shop used to be the BEST, hot roast beef sandwich on earth because it was two, thick slabs of home made bread, the best, rare roast beef and rich brown gravy served over mashed with a side of green beans and a house salad. It is NOT that now. It's slivers of dried out bread, gravy that has seen better days with a scum on top and no veggies but some lettuce and slivered carrots from a bag. Used to have amazing carrot and coconut cake... So dry it crumbled. I used to request this dinner for my birthday brunch.  It has gone the way of OLD VEGAS..."}
{"text":"OK. I wrote a bad review about this place a while back because of  a certain waiter and afterwards, the management that handled that certain waiter. That person has not been seen working the coffee shop since then. The homies can safely eat at Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop again. YEEEEEEEEEEEH!!!

My three favorites from this place: 

Breakfast Steak & Eggs: Always cooked consistantly. Basic NY Steak, over easy eggs, and hashbrowns. Always on point.

Prime Rib: I've had every single size portion that they serve. Thick cut if you want a big lunch. Double cut will feed your family, or just YOUR FAT ASS.

BBQ Pork Ribs: ALL DAY!!!

Friendly staff. Gangster desert area around the entrance. Will be coming back for more on lunch breaks. 


EYE LIKA!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this coffee house today for the first time. I had the steak and eggs with hash browns the steak was good but it could of been more tender. I always have my eggs well done scrambled and was not disappointed! My husband ordered a short stack of pancakes as a side and they were really good! I hope to come back for a dessert another time as they looked great!"}
{"text":"This place actually has great food!

Their Ribeye special is comparable to the Outback Steakhouse. My friends and I always go this meal, it's one of our favorites.

Also, their simple salad is very fresh and prepared promptly and along with the house dressing it's simply delicious and hits the spot. 

Now for the service, every time we come it's a new person but it's a very consist not service we receive. Prompt, courteous and polite. 

You'll not be disappointed with a visit and a munch here"}
{"text":"I was craving prime rib, so the hubby & I went here for our birthday dinner. Almost didn't make it to the restaurant due to the stench in the casino. This is definitely one of the earlier casinos on the north end of the strip. We made it to the cafe & almost didn't stay due to the age & state of the furniture/decor. Hubby talked me into staying. 
The clam chowder was delicious! Portions are large. Prime rib was so-so. Oh, the waitress kept coming back before we ordered to let us know they were out of rare, then med rare & so forth. We ordered before they completely ran out of prime rib altogether. 
Waitresses (one was new) were really nice & attentive, too. In fact, all the staff was so friendly! We didn't have room for dessert, but they ALL looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"After watching all those tacky late night jerrys nugget commercials for so many years I finally step into into this place today for lunch since I'm working on this side of town for the most part of the day. 
Pulled in & felt safe right away parking in between 3 metro cars :) first thought: \"I hope theyre not here on business\"
Walked into a twilight zone feeling kinda place. I noticed a pizza place and I kept walking past the live table gaming trying to find the coffee shop. 
when i finally found it, I asked the hostess if they had any specials and she pointed at a board on the entry way. I thought this place had cheap food specials? o.O apparently not ... lol
I went thru the menu and I noticed they mostly had strip casino food prices. 
Decided id go with the smallest prime rib plate. 
Needless to say, I mainly enjoyed the garbanzo bean soup and the ice water. 
It's hard to believe what they charge on this side of town for a less than ordinary meal. :/
(let me remind you guys that foremaster lane is just down the street lined up with the less fortunate) if you catch my drift!"}
{"text":"This place was clean, cute, and filled with pastries. My main complaint is that it's titled a coffee shop, but it really lacks in a selection of coffee. All the beverages are from a fountain including iced tea. The coffee selection was decaf or caffenated. Yeah, it might sound picky, but I truly expected a variety based off the name. 

Prices are similar to Dennys. I spent 12 dollars for an eggs Benedict and a fountain tea. The food was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the ham used, but it was good enough. The cook did a good job constructing a beautiful plate. My waiter was honest when answering my questions. He told me that the title coffee shop means 24 hour breakfast, which is new to me. 

Overall, I'll come back if I am in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place. You can play keno and eat, which is the main distinguishing feature from Dennys lol."}
{"text":"Okay this is an update review ,and I decided to bump up my rating to 5 stars instead of the 4 I once gave it, let me explain why. 

If you live in north Las Vegas then you probably heard of Jerry's nugget. What's more iconic than the casino itself? It has to be their famous coffee shop! This restaurant has been around before I was born and has stood the test of time.  Not only do they have a wide variety of dishes to offer, but  they also give you some of the best service hands down. 

And for their excellent hospitality that is why I wanted to give this establishment five stars! Every single one of their servers, host, and bus persons are amazing and some of the most kind hearted people you will ever meet. They deliver big smiles along with your food. Ladies and gentlemen these employees are true culinary front of the house professionals. 

The restaurant has a homey vibe to it which I love, oh and gotta love their beautiful display of cakes and desserts as soon as your walk in. Lots of big booths to sit at which are super comfortable. Internet connection kind of sucks haha but it's fine it's rude to be on your phone while your eating anyways. But let's get into the food shall we? 

Food is reasonably priced with page after page of delicious dishes you can choose from. Today I decided to get the tostada salad with carne Asada steak , I asked for the steak to be medium rare and sure enough it was cooked too perfection .I didn't expect so much steak either but they were very generous with the protein. I paid basically 11.00 for a huge steak salad which you can't beat!  The famous coffee shop is well known for their prime rib . I've had the prime rib before and let me tell You I fell in love with this dish, meat cooked to your liking ,super tender , packed with flavor, and comes with horse radish that will clear your sinuses in an instant haha. I also have a small hack I just learned to make your prime rib even better but I'll just write that as a tip . Son overall another top notch experience at this restaurant and I do recommend to try this place out so GO GO GO!!!!"}
{"text":"I share my namesake with this Casino and I love it's old Vegas feeling of aged gambling (and carpets).  It's good and smokey and plenty of drinks to go around for free if you are sitting at a slot machine. Tip the waitress $2 and she will be very grateful and return every couple of minutes to make sure you are still ok. Great original location to play slots or just sit back and people watch in the lounge chairs.  PLAY AT JERRY's!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, and we almost walked out. 
Took forever to get water, and when we did, the busser spilt it all over the table, no apology. The food was basically same if we had gone to Denny'a and paid less. Never got all of my food. Saw our server once. They only had one other table, not busy at all. Coffee shop? No. It's a Denny's in a casino. Took 2 hours for food, and another hour to get the check. The server is lucky I was a server once, and understand that if you have people dine-n-dash it typically comes out of her pocket, or else we could have gotten up and just left."}
{"text":"Servers are nice but WORST management ever -SARA! Who argues with their customers about a drink that we disliked and was full to the rim!? Clearly someone who needs a lesson in customer service. The servers should be in management, they were more understanding and knew that we were right in this situation."}
{"text":"They have the best prime rib around town. Good price great food great service all old school. Love this place great for anytime meals.  Great menu with different food for everyone and good desserts."}
{"text":"Good Quality, Good Service, Affordable Prices, Great Selection for American Comfort Food.  Not bad prime rib either.

more later..."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and a clean environment. I absolutely love the dessert case and of course the desserts."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Jerry's for breakfast this morning.  I haven't been here since the 1980s.  In walking through the casino, I was surprised at how much nicer it seemed to me than it did years ago.  Since it was morning, ti wasn't very crowded with people at slots and there wasn;t a lot of smoke to bother me.

I looked at the menu carefully, checked the Yelp reviews, and then ordered huevos rancheros.  I got the eggs over easy and I opted for corn tortillas.  Jerry's was very quiet.  In a short time, my breakfast was brought.  When I ordered, my server asked if I wanted mild or hot salsa.  I chose the hot.  Jerry's doesn't know hot salsa unless someone put the wrong salsa in the small dish she brought.  

There was a large serving of refried beans with some taco chips in the beans.  The eggs were done correctly and the entire dish was covered in chopped fresh tomatoes and lettuce shreds.

My server, Mamie, was very pleasant and competent.  She was back quickly with the coffee pot to refill my cup.  The breakfast was large, very filling, and good but there was nothing that would make this stand out above other huevos rancheros I've had.

I would like to go back sometime in the afternoon and get their strawberry ring for dinner.  It looked so good in the front case as did many of the other pastries including GIANT eclairs.

Jerry's is A-OK!"}
{"text":"Prime rib.  It's a great deal.  Very good."}
{"text":"I don't dine here too often, but have been here twice in the last 37 days.  First off, the menu can get a little overwhelming and that's a good thing. There's so much on the menu that it can be difficult choosing something to eat.  Their menu consist of apps, salads, breakfast, tons of sandwiches, burgers, chicken, pork, seafood, steaks, BBQ, Mexican food, Greek food, and of course, desserts.  Everything at Jerry's is priced crazy low and the portions are right on.  Every time that I ask for their recommendation, they tell me to get the prime rib because it's their signature dish.  I have yet to try it, but I'm sure that I will soon. I've been keeping it simple lately and usually just go for their Two Eggs Breakfast or the Burger Patty & Eggs.  The hash browns is the highlight of both meals and I'll have them make it extra, extra crunchy.  It's so good. 

Service is pretty good, but it really all depends on how busy they are.  The place can get busy, even on the weekdays.  I also noticed that Jerry's serves a lot of repeat customers and the servers know them by name.  Jerry's have been around a very long time. With all the breakfast joints that we have in town, it's good to see that Jerry's is still holding its own.  

2017 Yelp Review #127"}
{"text":"This place was on dirty dining for cockroaches . It has made a horrible change for the worse40 years in Las Vegas and I was appalled at the end of the prime rib and the horrible results after complaining. I very seldom, like 1 other time I ever complained about the food. Management does not care either. When Channel 13 came up with cockroaches, I was not surprised . I now go to Mainly Prime, or the  Cheesecake Factory . Jerry's Nugget is too old. They should implode it and start over. Also, a very dangerous neighborhood. Have security walk you to your car. This is a horrible area. You are not safe in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I love this place is great service and food . Prime rib is the best in town.  We haven't been here in awhile and man did we miss it.  We had the prime rib rare and it did not disappoint. Just a nice piece of meat."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few weeks ago and I was very impressed as was my family.  The diner has a really clean, old school look to it.  The menu is huge and everything we've had has been delicious.  My dad particularly love the eclairs!  You can gain about 10 lbs looking at one they are ridiculous.  This our new go-to place for breakfast or dinner."}
{"text":"Steak & Eggs did not hold a candle to the breakfast we used to get here in the late 70's. Too much fat on the steak and the hash browns were not cooked enough. But the coffee was good. And the eggs were perfect."}
{"text":"Been going here for prime rib for almost 20 years. Perfectly cooked fast efficient service. Typical casual diner, nothing fancy. the deserts are phenominal. I would just say to keep your receipt as they charged us twice for the tip amount we entered. Will return for prime rib for sure! Yummmm! :)"}
{"text":"Prime read was amazing but service was horrible took 20 minutes to get our waitress to come over and took an entire hour to get our food"}
{"text":"this is our old stand by for the best prime rib in Vegas. been coming for years. went on a monday daytime. got seated quickly. we had this really cool and amazing waiter. I forgot his name but he had cool groomed eyebrows and his hair was brown and teased up on each side. he wears a Ankh necklace. he was very attentive and accommodating. he had  only been there a year I heard him tell the other people sitting in the booth next to us. the food was amazing as always. I hope next time we go he will still be working there. If you go you must seek this guy out, you will get great customer service."}
{"text":"Being seated was fast! A plus was the booths are not bolted down to the floor so you can move the table for comfort.  

Drinks came out quick and in a timely manner, I was drinking soda! Our waiter even brought me another drink with only hitting half way down the glass. My wife's drink took a little longer, but she ordered a cocktail, but man it was made perfect, a little stronger than a normal cocktail, but definitely not distasteful. 

First course were the salads. My salad was good; a lot of ranch, but I like my salad like that. My wife had minestrone soup, she said it tasted canned. 

My wife and I, both ordered the Saturday special steak and shrimp. Both plates were small,  but tasted good. I wish the portion size was bigger for both items. 

Dessert was their famous éclair,  which was huge; easily feeds two people, maybe even three if you want to shared.

Over all, I would return to this place. I would not order the same dinner, but I would order the prime rib which seems to be ordered a lot, more so, it  looked amazing every time it passed by me."}
{"text":"I went to Jerry's Coffee shop specifically for the Prime rib dinner.
Since this was a meal on my birthday I wanted something special.

Garlic toast, A very tastee salad, Baked Potato butter and chives!
Yummy!

I had my Prime Rib rare 30 ounces of nice beef.

Service was attentive, by multiple employees.
My lady friend got the French dip sandwich an the Ring dessert.

If you want a good meal at a moderate price Visit The Jerry's Nugget Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"love the 50's style feel with the pie counter & cabinet


high back boothes with formica table tops


very clean & comfortable
waitress, hostess and drink guy were friendly enough but once we placed our order they were seldom seen.


menu was extensive but no pasta & they were out of rolls & ribs


drinks were a little slow coming


seemed a little under staffed
greek fries were crispy and very flavorful(italian seasoned) & cucumber dressing was cool & smooth not too overpowering

salads were fresh & crispy with blue cheese crumbles in the bleu cheese

biscuits were a little dry & not enough gravy-bacon was way way greasy-too much to even eat

prime rib was incredible-spiced just right-(lots of pepper) -melted into strands when soaked in the au jus. baked potato was hot & cooked all through

porterhouse was cooked perfectly med-very tender melted in your mouth-charring was done to perfection & made the steak that much better. veggies( julienne sliced carrots & broccoli were steamed & ok)potato was good but plain-no salt

banana cream pie was good-very little banana-but cream & ala mode were very smooth and sweet.

they had coke & mr. pibb, the iced tea was a little watered down.

this diner looks great with the modern spin on 50's diners and the enormous pie cases right in the door. the menu includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. mexican & american continental. over 40 differents cakes & pies. the service is a little slow-more worried about the big tables. the food is pretty good -the size of the prime rib is unforgettable-melissa will be up @ 3 a.m. with the \"meat sweats\" after that feast.

they have great steak specials-under $8 for steak & shrimp and of course steak sandwich & steak and eggs too.

for a casino cafe it's better than average-prices are fair and food is better than most"}
{"text":"This place it's great I read all the reviews bad and good and honestly I couldn't find anything wrong with this place, they have plenty security in the parking lot and inside also pretty clean a lot slot machines and tables, the cafe and food it's great tasty delicious the waitress was so cool and make you feel comfortable, very clean place, if you really looking for a comfortable place to enjoy a delicious food you should visit this place you might have to drive a little bit from the strip but it's worthy, go and convince by yourself."}
{"text":"WOW was my first reaction when i walked into Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop. The dessert case was filled with all these delcious cakes and pies. I just wanted to gobble everything up.  Going further into the coffee shop, another WOW, with how big the place is.
  I had the Ruben sandwich and my wife had the carrot cake.  The Ruben had a crispy bread on top but the bottom bread was a bit soggy from the juices of the sauerkraut and pastrami meat. The fries were standard steak fries, nothing exciting. The carrot cake consisted of thin layered carrot cake in between cream cheese frosting. My wife is a carrot cake lover but she found it too sweet. 
Three stars for the Ruben and carrot cake but I would be willing to try this place again for another dessert."}
{"text":"So we used to come here a lot for the prime rib... and it's not bad but the prices are no longer worth the drive... 

Onto today. It was not good. The service was bad and the food was mediocre. My food was made wrong and when I spoke to the server she took it back to the kitchen to have it remade. They removed a portion of my food and took the tomato off of the dish that I previously had and brought it back to me and told me that it was a new dish. 

When I asked her if this was a new dish she lied to me and said yes I then showed her where the lettuce and tomato from the previous dish or still throughout the plate and ask for the manager. After about five minutes the manager came over and asked what the problem was? 

I explain my side of the situation she said she would go to the kitchen and see what the problem was after a couple of minutes she came back and said she would remove it from my bill never one time did she apologized for the inconvenience and simply walked away.  

Bad management and bad service and the food wasn't great. I appreciate the fact that she removed the dish from my bill but I didn't eat it because it was wrong. 

So I'll never go back..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Just wish that they still had the horseradish roast beef melt with au jus.  Best comfort & greek !!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the food, the service & the attention to make sure everything is okay.

Yeah.. it's just a 'coffee shop', but it's more than that. I've been here 3 times now and on my last trip I went twice it was so good.

Their plates are so huge you need to share. We had the prime rib here for the first time and it was melt in your mouth good. The nachos and the breakfast I had were also great. The pancakes don't disintegrate when you put syrup on them, so that's a good sign! ;)

I seriously love this place & will always make a special trip out. If you can, try the coconut cake, it is so good."}
{"text":"Came herr @ 01:47 am with a friend.
Walked in by mistake, maybe world famous but I've lived in the city for 1.5 years and never heard of.
The only thing I need to say is wow. The service is exceptional,  the vibe feel is just fun.
I ordered a specials late night 8oz, steak and my friend ordered 1/4 burger
Served by Carollee, and marine BTW - the best I n the business.
Food - WOW"}

{"text":"Old stale donuts at Bingo. People complaining but does no good with these two nephews running place into the ground. Casino filthy always. Went for lunch and told 15 wait 4 table BUT I could sit at counter and order. 7tables in the joint w 5 eating. That nite is was on Dirty Dining??? Not the same anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Have been eating here for years and the food is always great.  The service is fabulous and the desserts are the best anywhere in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for a good sit down late night food. Especially since they have the night owl special at 11pm! Really great cheesecakes and other cakes. best ones are the peach, pineapple and blueberry! yumm"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall diner.  We loved the food but more important, the service/server and attention was amazing!! 

This diner is located in the NORTH part of Las Vegas in the Jerrys Nugget casino.  The location looks shady, but the diner was just the opposite!  It was welcoming, open and bright.  

They did not have the surf and turf special that attracted us there.  But I had the steak and crab special.  It was a good deal for the $10.  It came with a salad... you need to try the creamy italian as previously recommended!  A big piece of garlic bread, mashed potatoes with gravy, a good size steak and a few foil wrapped crab legs.  The mashed potatoes were good, the steak was grilled nicely, however the crab legs were salty.  My husband had burger with steak fries.  They were both good.  We finished it off with a slice of carrot cake.  It was huge!  Food was pretty good however the service and carrot cake was excellent!!  It was well worth the $25 bill!"}
{"text":"Been  coming here ever since i can remember, with my parents, and now with friends.
The food here is awesome! Cheap and plentiful. Everything is made fresh, and to order.
This is definitely one of Vegas's unknown secrets."}
{"text":"I love eating here.  The food is good. My waitress Mami was very attentive. She knows her stuff!!! Very clean. Breakfast is great and so are the prices"}
{"text":"We were referred to Jerry's by a friend, inspired by their prime rib.  We arrived around 2:30pm.  My wife ordered the medium cut so we both could share, while I ordered the combination Mexican dish.  Both dishes were very good, and generous.  So much so, we ended up taking portions of both dishes, home.  Both meals, two drinks, and two desserts cost a little over $50.00.  Can't beat the price and quality of the meals.  The service help was excellent, especially the server's assistant who was jolly on the spot.  The only negative:  The reception.  the  lady who apparently was in a supervisory capacity, was cold and stand-offish when we asked if we were at the correct restaurant.  As she walked away not saying a word, we followed thinking she was taking us to our table when she stopped and pointed to another saying \"she'll take you to your table\".  She spoke in a manner as if she were scolding us.  Fortunately, the other personnel were very friendly and courteous.  We will return, careful to avoid that same reception."}
{"text":"It's truly a shame...on food...they get a good 4 1/2 stars...on service a 1/2 star. EVERY time I go, I SWEAR I'll never come back. ALWAYS horrible service..food takes FOREVER to get there. We left today before even ordering...there was so much commotion even trying to get a seat we just cut our losses and took our appetites elsewhere. (Went gambling elsewhere too...so I HOPE the casino manager sees this!)

Again, NOT the first time...this is S.O.P. for the Coffee shop at Jerry's"}
{"text":"Food reasonable and tasty, service was ok, as the host gave us a funny look when we asked for hot water with lemon, is it anymore different than cold water with lemon( we both were a little under the weather)? I've been there many times for a meal and never had an issue, but this time was weird, the waitress only billed us for 2 breakfast that we ordered, when we went to pay, they told us we have to add charges for  2 teas, because you use the honey and lemon, like tea, even though it was hot water? Pretty petty, if I were to use honey and lemon in my cold water would they charge me extra for lemonade? I have had hot water  and lemon at many eating establishment, and never been billed for it, so minus a star. Would I go back, maybe, this left a sour taste in my mouth, maybe I'll stick to the deli and/or take my business elsewhere..."}
{"text":"If not for the ambiance which was laid back and the wait staff who were very friendly this would be a one star review. Food was bleh. First the coffee was terrible. I took one sip and left it. For a place with coffee in the name I was very disappointed. Most diners have reasonable coffee, not this place.

Then when it came to the food it was bland with nearly no flavor. Not sure why there are so many reviews praising the food. Be warned."}

Strawberry Ring - Choux, Bavarian Cream, Whipped Cream, Glazed Strawberries, Chocolate Shell

Largely incapable of sleeping in on weekends and having thus taken it upon myself to explore the Vegas 24/7 dining scene after my morning run a somewhat atypical Sunday would mark my first visit to North Las Vegas, home of Jerry's Nugget - a casino having celebrated its 50th anniversary just three days prior - and Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop, the 24/7 retro-modern eatery within.  Decidedly different from the Luxe resort-casinos of the southern strip but featuring a gritty sort charm it was just after 5:00am when I arrived at Jerry's and with a skeleton crew catering to just six other patrons in the large space service was expectedly accommodating with coffee kept brimming throughout as a somewhat slow (likely understaffed) kitchen prepared hot dishes allowing me to focus first on pastry - a collection of over fifty options baked in-house featuring cakes, pies, danishes, donuts, and more.  Beginning with the famous \"Strawberry Ring\" it should first be stated that for a choux-based pastry baked at least 8 hours prior to remain crisp and buttery beneath two types of rich cream speaks volumes to the quality of kitchen and with both textures and flavors aplenty the dish proved wonderful, a lightly sweet take on the Paris-Brest with a portion big enough for two or three more than justifying the $6 tab.  Working slowly through the ring with frequent coffee refills as I awaited my sandwich it was with some disappointment that when the Monte Cristo arrived the flavors would only prove average, the fried bread shining while proteins and cheese proved meager in both taste and portion, but propping the dish up with a touch of real maple syrup it should be said that at $1 each, the biscuits at Jerry's are worth seeking out - an excellent rise and good layer separation beneath a crisp, buttered top.  Taking the rest of my order to go, a veritable bargain at $5/slice, suffice it to say that while Jerry's may not be the best choice in town for a sandwich I'd be hard pressed to name a better choice for cake as each of my three selections shined; the anniversary cake a sort of dulce de leche with buttercream and frangipane vying for top billing over a delicate crumb, the bread pudding featuring two layers of rich pound cake topped with lightly sweetened egg custard and a bruleed top, and the carrot cake dense with cinnamon, nutmeg, carrots, raisins, and walnuts beneath thin ribbons of cream cheese frosting - the best I've found in the city to date and a contender for the best I've tasted anywhere in years."}

{"text":"we like the prime rib at jerrys the best around for the $. we always ask for Ashely for or server she is awesum. great deserts and sugar free also."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Food is good and great prices. Also the menu has something for everyone. I got the French toast w/ strawberries. It was just strawberries no glaze. 
This is a true coffee shop with a great legacy.
Crappy neighborhood but the security is in full force"}
{"text":"Went to breakfast here. Food was ok, prices are cheap. But service was bad. Probably a better place to go to for late night snacks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since i was a child, about 27 years now.  They have a great clam chowder on Fridays and their prime ribs are just great.  The dessert selection is also great.  Being opened 24hrs is a big bonus.  Most places that are opened 24/7 usually have pretty bad service and food quality isn't too high.  The Coffee Shop at Jerrys though is another matter.  Many times my wife and I have gone there for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie or cake.  Most of the time I get their fried zucchini with a side of ranch.  Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The place is small but it has a personality! But mostly I like the prices of the food, and especially the sandwich selection, the roast beef one is my favorite. The average eta costs about $10. The cocktails are at affordable prices. A simple pina colada costs $6. I counted more than 20 types of beers in the list. The bartender is a really friendly and communicative person. 
Overall food dring and staff - 5 stars. Another rare feature of this part of the town is the free parking.
However, no way to gove for the gambling room even one star. 
Slots a very tight so don't count on having a jackpot! The machines are dirty, some of them a recovered with ashtrays."}
{"text":"If you want some amazing prime rib and don't want to wait in a massive line to get seated come here! The prices are decent and the service is friendly. The prime rib is seasoned perfectly and comes with a salad and a side. The patrons are mostly elderly and the casino it's located in is an old throwback to Vegas yesteryear. I like that the menu has a full Mexican food option as well as Greek food."}
{"text":"To be honest, I did not gamble in the casino. I did, however eat a magnificent prime rib meal at Jerry's Famous Coffee Shop. For around $20, I had a 28-30oz slab of succulent, and savory prime rib, with mashed potatoes, chicken soup, and an unsweetened iced tea. Not only was the restaurant spotlessly clean, my waitress was super friendly, and the food was perfectly made to order. The bone-in prime rib must be the signature item on the menu. It was perfectly juicy. Everyone who visits Las Vegas should order prime rib in the coffee shop today. Take Las Vegas Boulevard North into North Las Vegas, and look for the giant Jerry's Nugget Oil Rig sign on the western side of the road!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome. A true Vegas coffee shop. Great values and great food. Had plenty of stuff from this place and it's all good!"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on Monday, we sat at the counter because we knew the service isn't all that great. Counter service was good, but the good quality was not. Mac Donald's make a better burger, and broiled chicken breasts were very small and tasteless. And for a $13.00 piece of chicken, I should have ordered from Mickey D's. We won't be back, too many other places to grab lunch"}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered an omelette and a Macha plate. The customer service is slow. We waited a long time, before they brought our drink order. The food order didn't take as long. Prices are decent. They have tempting desserts on display, but I didn't have room to try one."}
{"text":"Our server was good. The food took quite awhile to come out and when it did all eggs were overcooked. I ordered Eggs Benedict and the poached eggs came out with yolks completely cooked. My sister ordered over medium and they were hard. They took them back and had the chef redo them. It was frustrating to wait so long but once they redid the food, it was good."}
{"text":"Had a meeting near Cashman Center and we had 45 minutes for lunch.  Jerry's Nugget was less than 5 minutes away and seemed to have good yelp ratings. Fifteen years in Vegas and I'd never been inside. I was impressed by the condition of the casino - very well kept. 

I'd say the restaurant was 40 percent occupied. It took a few minutes to seat our party of three. About 5 minutes later our orders had been taken. 

Simple order. Two of us had the Mexican pizza (basically a quesadilla): one with beef, other with chicken. Third party had a salad and each of us ordered a soft drink. 

Took at least 20 minutes to get our food and the order was wrong. Ate it anyway due to time constraints.  The Mex pizza was a large portion but unremarkable, even by coffee shop standards. 

When the check came, I thought it seemed high. Discovered they had put two extra drinks on there at a cost of $4. 

In short, the waitress was mistake prone and the food was just okay. Cost us about $15 per person. 

Based on our experience, I wouldn't recommend it, nor would my companions."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So reasonable and tasty. It is off the strip but worth the trip. Desserts were amazing! Fresh and tasty describes this place best!"}
{"text":"Old School Vegas combined with East Coast Diner fare. When you walk in you are greated by giant pastries and friendly waitresses who have worked there forever.  The portions are huge for the price and the prices are what made Vegas famous.  There are always specials.  The food is always good and surprisingly fresh.  The price, value, and diner feel are great but ultimately even free, bad food is bad.  Luckily Jerry's delivers above average comfort food from meatloaf to dolmathes.  Another plus is it is close to the door so you avoid most of the smoke.  I have tried the taco salad, meatloaf special, and more and while I have never walked away saying it was the best ever, I have enjoyed my meal.  I even won a 25 dollar gift card once."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Jerry's Coffee shop, a relic family owned casino off the beaten path, I was hoping to find a hidden gem tucked away.  
 Atmosphere I would rate at 3 (the smell of fried food lingering in the air just doesn't do it for me).
 Service was solid 5, our waiter was beaming with enthusiasm, was attentive and prompt. Cashier was a sweetheart and very polite. 
 Now the food- that's where everything fell short. A solid 2.
 Prime rib specials at casino coffee shops aren't a novelty, Jerry's is no exception, offering up slabs of meat ranging in size and price. 
  I went for $13.98 special 8-10 oz cut. You get garlic bread (don't eat bread, but it looked like garden variety buttered bread and my party didn't care for it), soup or salad (I went with salad minus dressing. It came out laden with cheese shavings. Doh!).
 You get a choice of rice, potatoes every which way or white rice. I wanted vegetables, so I looked through sides to see what's available, in case I could strong arm the waiter into loading my plate with broccoli instead of fries.
 No such luck. Only garden offering is listed as \"vegetable garnish\". I pictured twisted orange rind and wilted kale and deflated my hopes. 
 I inquired anyway, and waiter politely told me no vegetables were permitted to find their way to my plate in lieu of potatoes. 
 I went with fries, steak cut variety, completely unseasoned, by the taste of it. 
 The meat itself was medium rare per my request, but had more inedible gristle and fat than I've encountered in prime rib at any other coffee shop or buffet in Vegas. I had to surgically remove easily half my portion to get to edible morsels. 
 My party had steak and lobster special at $19.99 and didn't have anything outstanding to share about the meal either. 
 Sorry, Jerry's, maybe other offerings on the menu are better (like Mexican or Greek sections), but prime rib was a flop. 
 Not that I seek out coffee shop prime rib often, but Downtown Grand overs a nice cut at $9.99 with all the vegetables I want. No soup or bread, but I can deal. 
 Don't see myself rushing back."}
{"text":"Went in and order the two of the listed specials, ask for it to go, I was first was told that they did not do specials to go, then they change and told me they could. The special came with noddles and I ask if I could have rice instead. I was told that there was no modification to the specials. No where was that posted. I explain that I could not eat the noddles, because they were hard for me to digest, The manager told me no as well, and said maybe you should order something else. Not a good beginning for my first time in this establishment. The old daying that if the food is good, you tell a few, but if it is bad you tell everyone. So I shared with my experience."}
{"text":"We were pleased.  Burger was not a frozen burger.  Bun was probably home made.  Place was clean and modern.  Got good service from bus staff.   Prime rib was good.  Potato was good. We will go again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 41 years and after today not going back. How sad, we used to eat breakfast here and saw Jerry often, he would not be proud. 

Since my last visit only two months ago the food has drastically changed for the worse. The Best Mexican salad ever and I drive 300 miles to get it, but now it is half the normal size. Best prime rib my husband loves but it had zero and I mean zero taste and was swimming in a nearly clear broth! We left it in the plate and he said it's the worst I ever had anywhere! 

I'm leaving hungry. And very sad. This has been our favorite place since we were kids.

But I did get my gluten free desert because those are fantastic!!!!

To the owner: If you were loosing money because your food costs were too high...you shouldn't  ruin the product and maintain the price...maintain the good food you offer and charge more for the quality you deliver!"}
{"text":"This meal only reminded me why we had not been here in so long. A half pound guacamole burger ordered medium with cheese was served well-done with brown guacamole and a limp piece of cheese that was still cold.  Server offered to re fire but we were in a hurry. . The. Turkey club had 2 thin slices of Turkey and 2 pieces of bacon. The there was more lettuce and tomato than meat. . The only good thing is they still serve great steak Frys, thick and crisp. . Guess we'll stay away another year or so."}
{"text":"November 17, 2011 - stopped in for breakfast on the way to Valley of Fire. It's been 10 years or more since we'd been in Jerry's Nugget - I must say, the entire casino is much cleaner, nicer than it used to be (it was a dive). The coffee shop is totally re-done from how I remember it. Breakfast was just average, but very inexpensive - less than $14.00 for the two of us."}
{"text":"What a really nice casino and coffee shop. I have been in Las Vegas since the 80's and I have never been to Jerry's Nugget Casino Look what I have been missing, seriously. Well, in all honesty, its not in the best part of North Las Vegas. Even so, I was pleasantly surprised..
The reason I dined at this restaurant on New Years Day is because my boyfriend is Greek and he says this place has authentic Greek food. Really I said to him? Ha! 
And, so we pulled in around 630pm, Plenty of parking, very nice outside grounds and a beautiful waterfall in the front by valet.

It seemed like the restaurant was not too busy, but everyone there seemed a bit stressed out? Not sure why? Im only giving 4 Stars because it took thirty minutes to be served(actually a little longer than that). I guess they were not all on the same page that night. I think we had like 3 different servers? Its ok, as long as my belly gets filled! We were happy when the food came.

 Now, I cannot pronounce the name of all the food(Greek), but I will say, I loved the Greek lasagna thing, and the grape leaves wrapped in some kind of beef and rice. And of course, it comes with pita bread and some kind of cucumber white sauce. Haha, I dont know what its all called, but it was damn tasty!

Will I go back? Absolutely! Im quite happy to have enjoyed some authentic Greek food with my man. But, I think I need to go to Greece with him to get the real deal! LOL
Happy eating! Yes, its worth the drive and the prices are awesome for the large portions."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few remaining classic Las Vegas Cafe that goes big on both service and quality for a great value!  I ordered the Zucchini as an appetizer, which was great especially coming in piping hot and with a good amount of crunch at each bite.  The serving size was perfect, especially dining with 2 others.  The rest of my party preceded to order with a Chicken-Caesar salad and Grilled Salmon which they both truly enjoyed.  I chose the Porterhouse Steak, which for the price of $19, was truly a bargain.  It came with a few veggies and a starch (I chose baked potato) and had plenty to take home since it was quite big to finish in one sitting.  If you're around the Northern Area of Las Vegas Blvd and looking for a place to dine, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"They wowed me! The Steak & Lobster special $9.89. The steak was high grade and perfect med. rare. Nailed the lobster in cook and seasoning...,but it's the little things I notice. Food served fast. Condiment bottles clean, new and not married or watered down. Great dessert array. Chowder chock full of clams. I see the large assortment of menu items are higher than most coffee shops, but the quality is there so it's worth it."}
{"text":"We finally made it over to check out the dessert selection at Jerry's Famous Coffee shop! I was in the mood for banana cream pie, they were out so we settled on a chocolate cream pie. A slice of pie is $4.50 so we decided on a whole pie for $15.00 which is 7 large slices. I like that they pre-slice the pie, very convenient and will avoid the mess of cutting it on your own, also the slices are equal size!

Mmmm this pie is yummy for sure, love the chocolate whipped mousse like cream filling and the white whipped cream they use is also tasty. The crust is flaky and tasty as well as the generous garnishment of shaved chocolate! This is a generous and rich pie, well worth the $15 bucks!

They had the old school style refrigerated glass cake and pie display case and a spinning display. That was a blast from the past for sure.

We selected from what they had already made. They had a strawberry shortcake cake with strawberries so large on top. I just could not bring myself to paying $36.00 for a cake when it is not even a special occasion. It sure looks delicious and I think next time I will get a slice to test it out first, I am sure is worth the money as it looked Divine!

You can call ahead for a special pie or cake request.

All cakes and pies are homemade on premise out of their bakery.

The options are mind blowing and all look Amazing!

I can not wait for the next opportunity to try other pies and cakes!

{"text":"We were tipped off by a local resident about this place.  Nice recommendation.  Two drinks (made a little strong, but that's OK), salads with house made dressing, steak dinner, chopped sirloin dinner... $47.  Very reasonable. The cakes and eclairs were a work of art, but we just couldn't force any more food down.  The eclairs were actually enough for 3 people.  Service was excellent.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've tried a lot of places in Vegas, and we keep going back to Jerry's.  Don't be put off by the kind of seedy neighborhood. The menu is extensive and diverse. In addition to American stand-by's, it also includes a full page of Chinese and Greek dishes.  The side dishes taste like they were prepared fresh (my daughter and boyfriend rave about the potato salad). I love the prime rib dip. And the deserts - oy vey like you wouldn't believe. Two full cases of cakes and pies, all fresh and delicious. The wait staff is always friendly ( we like William and Danny) and the service is fast. We've never had to wait to be seated.  Very reasonable prices. Love this place."}
