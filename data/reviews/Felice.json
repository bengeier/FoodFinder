{"text":"Dined at Felice for the first time today and it was absolutely amazing. I was initially interested because they allow dogs on their patio... huge plus for me! When I arrived, I was greeted by such friendly staff. The Happy Hour menu had some really nice options so I stuck with that. Delicious cocktails and real food (nothing that resembled stereotypical bar food). I got the Fried Calamari and Chickpea Salad Melt. The calamari was surprisingly light. Usually, because it's fried, it's heavy but these weren't. It came with some sort of lemony dipping sauce that added a nice freshness to the appetizer. The chickpea melt was great; salt, savory, and a bit of tang from the tomatoes. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We cancelled our reservation because of the hosts terrible attitude. We had called to confirm and they had lost our reservation. Then we remade, but when we showed up, they would not seat for happy hour drinks and told us they would \"try\" to seat us for our reservation. As I said, We cancelled our reservation because of the hosts terrible attitude,  and it takes A LOT for me to do something like that."}
{"text":"This perennial hot spot is suffering a bit in mid spring 2011.  Staff is overwhelmed by the re-emergent patio seeking crowd while the kitchen performance achieves it's quality albeit slowly. 
Advice - put the manhattan back on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"It's with regret that I rank Felice with only two stars. If it were merely about the food, I would rank it at least three if not four, but the service on more than one occasion has been disappointing.

I rated Felice once before, based on its Saturday brunch, which unfortunately is a thing of the past.  While it was a very tasty brunch selection, I was not surprised to hear they had quit offering morning fare, considering we were the only diners in the place at 10A on a Saturday morning.

But this review is about dinner, or dinners rather. Felice is one of the few places on the near East side that stays open late on weekends.  Their kitchen closes at midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, which is great if you're not an early diner.

I have been there three times in the past six weeks for late night dinners, and each time, I greatly enjoyed my meal, but was frustrated by the service each time.

The first time I went for dinner was with a group of nine people.  We got there at about 11P, and the place was rather busy. The restaurant is in an older two story house, and the former porch area has been closed in and is now used as additional dining areas. We were fortunate to get a large table in the front porch area; we were told that it was heated, but given that it was January, it really wasn't insulated well enough.

That evening there were a few large parties, and considering the hour, the slow service didn't really phase me that much. I had a delicious meal of chicken thighs with seasonal vegetables. The chicken thighs were well prepared, although that's hardly impressive, as it's one of the most forgiving types of meat there is. The seasonal vegetables, however were delicious - in particular the brussels sprouts. I'm not usually a fan of the cabbage's smaller cousin, but these were delicious and I was sorry there weren't more of them.

Although our meals were very slow in arriving, the server was attentive and checked in regularly. Had I rated Felice after that meal, I probably would have rated it with 4-Stars.

I returned with my partner for a 10P meal on a Friday the following week, and was expecting an equally good meal, but with better service. I was to be disappointed. Again, no real complaints with the food, but the service was worse ... much worse.

I ordered the steak frittes, which was deliciously prepared, but the piece of steak itself was a little smaller than I would have liked for the price. The frittes were fine, but not amazing.  My partner ordered the boullabaise, which he found tasty, but unimpressive. His biggest complaint was that no bread was served with the soup, and he had nothing to accompany the seafood broth. The meals rated at least a 3-Star, but then there was the horrible service.

We conjectured that the server may have been working his first night at Felice, and based on watching him with other tables, it seemed like it may have been his first night working in any restaurant ever. We waited at least 15 minutes after being seated before we were approached for our drink order, and another 15 minutes by my watch before he returned with a single  glass of wine. It was another 25 minutes after we placed our orders, before our meals were brought out from the kitchen, and we had to ask twice for refills on water. In the end, we had to flag down the manager to get our bill, after waiting more than 20 minutes after our plates had been empty and clearly pushed aside for removal; we would have ordered coffee and dessert, but couldn't stand the idea of waiting longer. 

All told it was more than an hour of waiting, and it wasn't just us; we watched as all the tables around us waited and grumbled about slow service. Subsequently I have spoken with at least five other people who have dined at Felice, and they all say the same thing: Good food, horrible service."}
{"text":"No beers on tap. $12 appetizers... rude at front. I couldn't bring myself to order anything. It was pretty outside. Definitely a \"first date\"-kind of place. I just wanted good food and atmosphere at a decent price price. Not here."}
{"text":"I would have never found this place on my own, and I probably wouldn't have gone seeing as I'm a dedicated west sider and this place is pretty deep east for me. I am glad I went for dinner on Friday, it was so delicious. Really cool atmosphere ( it's an old house I think). I had a great cocktail and the best vegan tacos I think I've ever had. Innovative and exciting menu. Very cool place. I subtracted a star for inconvenience of finding it and parking. It's mostly because of my west side bias so if your stomping grounds are east side/ shaker heights area, add on another star!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  Unfortunately, after three visits (Nov. 2010, June 2011 and October 2011), I have to say I have had bad experiences each time. The first and second time, the food was substandard.  This past weekend, it was everything. The service was horrible.  The waiter forgot our drinks on numerous occasions and had to come back to clarify.  I ordered the burger medium rare and it came out far past well done.  Upon asking them to recook it (I rarely do this), it was just as overcooked.  As a peace offering, they kindly offered to buy me a drink.  That was nice; however, it would have been better if they didn't charge me for a dinner that I barely ate.

Nice patio.  I hope the next owners get better waitstaff and kitchen help."}
{"text":"Insulting and arrogant are a bad combination. Greeted warmly by the half  hammered owner but downhill from there. Waited 2.5 hours for cold entrees. Dispite multiple complaints tot he server, the [mis]-manager did not show up until i change his $150 bill [including the mandatory 18% gratuity ] to $50. That got his immediate attention. There is a no-tipping policy on my next check , just so you know. Then we will be back to even."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our three cheeseburgers even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  When the food arrived the burgers were cold and my kids didn't even have cheese on their burgers . They took them away and took ten minutes to add and melt the cheese.  The burgers were inedible at that point.  They chose to \"comp\" our sodas as an apology.  Wow.  Thanks for a shit meal and zero apologies for crap service.  Wont go back even if it's a free meal."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for meal.  Loud music..Menu says music will be loud until 7:00 and there is nothing they can do.  Slow service.  Entree:  3 scallops, 3 Brussel Sprout halves and a large tablespoon of Polenta.  Tasty but inadequate -- more like an appetizer.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Great food and drinks. Bold flavors. The cocktails are unique and food is delicious. I live in the area and this is my hangout place. If you are a bold person with chill intentions and macho man cravings this is the place to be, you guys."}
{"text":"Always good, especially the mushroom dishes.
Love the reverse happy hour, which can get a bit noisy."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Atmosphere is awesome both winter and summer. Tacos are excellent especially the tortillas - thin tortillas! Polenta is creamy and vegetables are perfectly cooked. Service is friendly and tentative. Their a great asset to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Oh my - terrible service. you could spend a whole evening waiting for your burger.

But, the burger was good. Like a off the beaten path good burger is supposed to be. 

The fried chickpeas were very nice as well."}
{"text":"By accident I ended up at this place and considered it a stroke of good luck. If you appreciate good food, attention to flavors and textures - this place is for you. I happened to go on a Wednesday night when they offer a prix fixe menu (which includes a small plate, entree, and dessert). As an appetizer I ordered the fried chickpeas which were delicious and would go great with a beer. For dinner I had the green beans small plate (which was out of this world), scallops for my entree (which were cooked perfectly and I was pleasantly surprised), and creme brulee (which was lemon and lavender - YUM). It's a little gem in the city that has superb food and the service was excellent! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been to Felice twice in the last year and both times the service has been awful.  The first time I went was last summer and sat at the outside bar with a friend.  We went on the 3 for $22 night.  We ordered a drink and our food.  the appetizer came and then we waited an hour for our entrees. We mentioned the wait several times to the bartender and the response was simply....sorry we have a larger party inside and it is slowing down the kitchen.   Not a great excuse in my opinion.  By the time we were done with our entree it was almost 10pm so we got the dessert to go.  At no time did the manager apologize or say a word to us. 

The second time, I was part of a party of 8.  The service was slow again and it took over an hour for our entrees.  Which I would forgive since it was a large party, but one of guest at our table mentioned the wait to the server.  She proceeded to get the manager who came back and said we were wrong we did not wait an hour for our food.  He knew this because he check the food ticket.  This was not the response I was expecting.  A simple apology would have gone a long way, but arguing with the guest is not the best way to gain a following. Plus, since the ticket was only put in 30 minutes prior to our food arriving and we did wait an hour, this means the server did not get our order in as soon as she took it. 

Then when I did take a bite of my burger, which I ordered rare, it was well done and cold. 

I was not impressed and will not go back."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go together for birthday or any party! Sit in the garden in summer and enjoy the cool air before sunset!"}
{"text":"Our second time for eating at Felice.  Patio was full and they let us know as we came in that service would be slow so we were prepared.  We asked to be seated inside, and we were the only group inside.  We were concerned about being forgotten, but the waiter was terrific.  Although it took 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive, our salads came within 10 minutes of ordering, and the entrees 15 minutes after that-a shorter wait than in most restaurants.  Beet salad was amazing-we licked the plate.  I had bucatini with calamari and it was absolutely delicious.  The waiter said it would be messy to eat but so worth it, as I tucked my napkin into my collar.  Better to cut than to twirl she advised.    2 out of party had the duck and it did not disappoint.  The 4th in our party had ribs and announced they were the best they had ever eaten.

This funky place with the friendly wait staff will definitely be on our list of great places to eat."}
{"text":"Visited here 10/09/2015 and the charm of this house restaurant is just amazing....I didn't eat on the main floor of the house but choose to go upstairs to the bar lounge area....there I met a very nice woman our bartender Rebecca....and wouldn't you know it was her first day but she handled herself like a pro whose been working there for years....the drinks she made were divine and the food to my surprise was brought up by the owner....talk about taking care of your patrons....I will definitely be back but I would love to check it out during the summer so that I can sit outside...check it out....you'll love it!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour in a great venue! The restaurant is a reworked large Cleveland home with wooden staircases and great little nooks for hang-outs. The happy hour is served on the top two floors on low tables and lounge-type seating so it can get a little awkward for eating, but I suppose the happy hour deals are worth it. 
The seafood taco was highly recommended but I would say it was good at best, not great. The poached mussels and steamed clams were very good. The goat cheese was very good and deliciously indulgent for a cheese lover such as myself. The service is great and I'd love to come here for a meal and not happy hour sometime!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. The food is always delicious and they change their menu regularly so there is always something new to try. The first time I ate here, I ate up in the bar area upstairs. It had a nice energetic atmosphere and it provides a great place for a happy hour or night cap. I always get the goat cheese appetizer and always enjoy it. It's big enough to share with everyone. 

The second time I ate here was on a date night with my wife and we sat downstairs in the main dining area. The atmosphere downstairs is a little more subdued, which is great for a date night. We were able to carry on a conversation without having to shout over background noise. 

 It's a cute restaurant since it is in an old house. The wait staff are knowledgeable of the food and drinks and are more than happy to make suggestions. My wife, who is vegetarian, absolutely loves their veggie tacos and always raves about them. I have had their hanger steak, which was delicious but nothing to write home about. However, I have also had their spaghetti and lamb meatballs and it was fantastic. The sauce was the right balance of savory and sweet and the portion size was perfect."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after a day at the museum of art and Loganberry bookstore. Great outdoor summer patio, great service and Mac and cheese was delightful with chorizo sausage, apples and jam. Great night out! Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food: I must applaud Felice for delivering the first entirely tasty fish taco I have had in... ever. I ordered the salmon tacos and never looked back. They balanced the mildly pickled onions/tomatoes with a sweet glaze along with some greens and cabbage. The flavors played well on my palate and I enjoyed every bite. Additionally, I was attending a birthday dinner and spent a lot of time chatting. As a result my dinner got progressively colder. I must say, it tasted just as good to the last bite. Strange and impressive.

Service: Meh. I must qualify that with a bit of an explanation. There were a couple dozen of us schmoozing on the third floor. This probably qualifies as a \"handful\" and I suppose I should cut the servers some slack. They did manage to fill my water glass regularly and check in. When I wanted another beer there were there to take the order. You can't really expect much more with so many to serve.

Atmosphere: I LOVED the decor. It had an Alice in Wonderland type feel with the red paint and flowery design. The unique lighting fixtures were interesting to behold. It was a bit dim, but that worked well for our dining experience.

Price: Fair. Not a steal, but not outrageous. I would describe it as fair enough of a price that I would gladly pay again for the same experience and food, but not cheap enough to become a regular. It is a tasty treat for this broke college cat.

No pics. I'll work on that."}
{"text":"this place is great. cozy dining area with open kitchen, great service, affordable. We really enjoyed the menu, which has items from $3-$20 ranging from pizza to grilled octopus! I recommend the fried asparagus and the crispy pizza. will be returning soon"}
{"text":"I'm a bit reluctant to review Felice because it is my \"best-kept secret\" and part of me would like to keep it that way!

Five stars for superb food, a diverse and interesting menu, comfortable, welcoming atmosphere, and good value.  I haven't dined indoors yet; the patio/garage/garden is incredible, especially when the string lights go on at night!  Seriously:  you forget that you are at a restaurant and think that you're at someone's house for a dinner party.  The noise level is ideal for conversation without being too quiet.  I've dined with groups but this would also be a fantastic place for a date or even solo dining.

The happy hour and Wednesday evening deals are excellent values and give you a lot of choices.  We love the chips and whipped guac for $3.

The menu is truly mouth-watering and I have yet to order (or accompany someone who orders) a less-than-stellar meal.  I don't know how this size of restaurant can support such an extensive menu, but I love it!

Service has never knocked my socks off, but it hasn't been bad.  Maybe a bit on the slow side at times, but it is hard to care when you have a drink in hand, sitting on that patio in perfect Cleveland summer weather!"}
{"text":"Impressed not only by the ambiance and service but also at variety of vegetarian and seafood options. Set just off of South Woodland/ Larchmere Blvd, this restaurant has taken residence in a old three story bungalow. The entrance is in the back (to the left of the front door)- if you head to the front, you will be waved to the side with a smile by the diners sitting at the window.
I have been here twice in the past year- once at the bar and another downstairs on the enclosed porch with 5 other people (we sat a round table in the corner and it was the perfect spot- private, with a view and even toasty in the winter. My experience at the upstair bar was excellent as well. At the time there was a tofu burger on the menu that just blew me away. The bartender was friendly, attentive and just the right amount of talkative. This visit I ordered the homemade Pappardelle which was served in subtle tomato sauce with crispy sage and chèvre. The dish was savory and mellow, the perfect dinner at the end of a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting Felice for the first time last Friday evening.  We went with another couple who recommended we meet there on a chilly evening.  What a great place!  The restaurant is in a wonderfully remodeled old home, the bar is located upstairs and is very comfortable and warm.  The staff is very friendly, helpful and obviously very appreciative of the owner Margaret Mueller who created this restaurant in 2007, when apparently she was nearing her 80th birthday.  Like many good owners, we were told she is present in the early evening almost every day and does live next door to the restaurant.  

The beverages were great, the wine list very good, the servers were knowledgeable, prompt and friendly.  The restaurant was clean and we dined off the happy hour menu that was also very nice.  Very nice selection of nicely prepared and tasty small plates, appetizers, entrees and sweet plates.  We enjoyed cauliflower, burgers, frites, chocolate cake, apple cobbler and a good time! Looking forward to visiting on the large patio in warmer weather."}
{"text":"My girlfriend always checks yelp for everywhere we go and we were doubtful after reading some of the reviews but decided to check it out anyways. Upon arrival we were asked if we had any reservations which we did not, and were told would be 20 minutes wait for a table outdoors. It didn't even take that long for a table to become available. My girlfriend ordered a 'Don Quixote' and I ordered the white sangria, both were delicious. We started with the cheese plate and an arugula salad to share - both were delicious.  We had to wait for our main courses for about 35 minutes, but it was worth the wait for such great food. The barbecue ribs were the best I have ever tasted, and my girlfriend loved her grilled tofu as well. We enjoyed our time so much and made reservations to bring our friends next week. Lesson learned? Don't get fooled by whiney customers posting bad reviews! ;)"}
{"text":"Hats off to the chefs. Absolutely amazing food. Service is probably the worst I've seen in Cleveland. We had a large party, but that's no excuse to be taking our plates after one bite of food (I was distracted by conversation and saw my plate was gone). Multiple people in our party weren't finished before the server took our plates. Our server seemed frustrated that we were a large party. Probably better to go with only a few people here."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on Open table for 7 p.m. Showed up at 7:05 Was told 15/20 minutes , \" go get a drink at the bar\". At 7:30 I asked the \" major demo\" what the status was, btw saw 3 open tables , and was told that the table they had for us was still occupied and the patrons had not ordered their entrees for 2 hours after seating. To which I replied \" and that effect me how\"? Turns out another 30 to 45 minutes.Really junior , bush league service and we left. Had a fabulous dinner at Mimi's on Fairmont, much happier. Good luck to Feliz - or not so much feliz"}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Great food. Great service. If you don't live near Larchmere this is definitely worth the trip. Try the pork belly sandwich!"}
{"text":"This was our third time there, service was slow, portions very small, ie, scallop dinner, 3 scallops, 1 1/2 brussel sprouts.  Really?  Not returning."}
{"text":"2 out of 4 people in our party got very sick after eating here!!!

If I could give negative stars I would.

To start we showed up for a 7:00 reservation and did not get seated till 7:35. Because of this the host said he would buy our first round of drinks, never happened.

On to the food, the only item that was good was the goat cheese app. (kinda hard to screw up a cheese plate) the burger was greasy and about half the size of the bun. The frites were half cooked and dripping with grease. 

The only good part of the night was laughing at the staff because they were trying so hard to act and look hip it was painfully clear their style and look was a few years late.

What a shame because their other restaurant fat cats is great."}
{"text":"The food was delicious- high quality ingredients, creative, and beautifully presented!  Also- take advantage of 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  The space is also really nice without being stuffy, and they have an outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"Great food. I love the location. The staff are very nice and attentive. In the summer there is plenty of outdoor seating. It's become very popular so important to make reservations especially on the weekends. One of my favorite places to eat at in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for eclectic American food. We had squash soup mushroom Cristini salmon tacos and squash ravioli. For dessert we had a bananas foster that had whole almonds that were grilled and it was just sumptuous. 
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Be careful if you are with customers who cannot climb steps. This restaurant does not seem to be handicapped accessible."}
{"text":"Felice is a strange place, I'll give them that. And until our most recent visit, I wasn't entirely too thrilled with the place. Since the ownership shift, I'm not sure if the happy hour is the same, but the first time I was here for it, it wasn't the greatest. The service was wonderful, but the drinks and food were not. The goat cheese was amazing, but the chickpeas were nothing to write home about. 

We did come here for dinner post-ownership shift and were really impressed. I haven't been here more than those couple of times, but I can see the 3 stars turning into 5. I got the mac and cheese and it was absolutely amazing. White cheddar, gorgonzola, chorizo, apple, and onion...I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I can't wait to come back and hopefully try something else, though I know that I'll probably get the mac and cheese again. 

What is holding me back from the 5 stars the mac and cheese deserves? Our dinner service was weird. Our server was nice, but we felt a little neglected. And the layout of the place, while interesting, doesn't lend itself to a really great experience in the winter. The seating area in the \"porch\" area was cold and felt really disconnected, though I'm not sure I would have enjoyed eating in the other cramped space we saw. I guess I just need to come back and get a better feel for the place."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner with my wife, a bit loud on the interior of this old home turned restaurant...but some unique preparations of their globally infused American food.

We started off with the chilled avocado soup.  It had the velvety texture of being blended in a Vitamix (not sure if it was or not) and was topped with breadcrumbs giving it an interesting texture on the tongue.  Followed that with a large portioned mixed greens salad that had a delightful, light dressing to it.

For our next appetizer course, we chose the fried goat cheese served with crostini bread.  The cheese was warm and oozing, and along with the accompanying sauce made for bite sized heaven.

Our dinner plates consisted of chorizo mac-n-cheese (for me) and a hanger steak (for my wife).  The chorizo mac-n-cheese had an unusual combination of flavors and textures.  The noodle were large elbow and the mix of cheese was creamy and tangy.  The chorizo gave the dish a spicy kick, but then it also had chunks of granny smith apples sprinkled throughout and the entire dish was topped off with sweet caramelized onions.  When you got a bite of all those flavors together it was a real explosion!

My wife's steak was cooked perfectly and had a hearty sauce on it.  The dish was served with chilled asparagus and crispy new potatoes with a wonderful aioli dipping sauce.

Overall an excellent meal and a nice evening out."}
{"text":"We came here before the big crowd hit the place!
It sure looked very popular since by the time we left it was packed. We had some appetizers like hummus, and cheese plate, followed by tofu tacos, Korean rib and scallops. They were all great! Kids really enjoyed the hummus and cheese plates. They were very friendly."}
{"text":"Came to Felice for happy hour, left here feeling very satisfied and wanting to come back. 

Felice serves up delicious small plates from their happy hour menu, and their full menu looked extensive (I'll have to give that a try next time). Felice is located in the Larchmere neighborhood area in an old, three-story house. It reminded me a lot of parts of Tremont, but had a more suburban feel to it. I ordered the Veggie Kofta tacos, and was delighted with the crispy, perfectly seasoned kofta in the middle of a substantial pita-like taco shell. The vegetables and tahini were the perfect topping to cap this Mediterranean-inspired dish. Two of these babies and I was ready to take on the night!  I topped it off with a $3 platform porter. 

The owner happened to be around Felice when I went in; she was extremely friendly and sparked good conversation; I got a very homely feel."}
{"text":"This is a great place we sat at the bar and the food is tasty but the bartender has an attitude . When I asked to order a dessert I was told \"not now I'm Really busy \" what kind of bartender says that??????"}
{"text":"Used to be amazing and one of our favorite places.  But when the chef left and Margaret started having her kids take over, the place has really fallen hard.  The service has taken a precipitous decline and the food & drinks are not to the standards that it used to be.  We gave it several shots, in hopes that things would turn around, but it only seemed to get worse."}
{"text":"Kudos to the Chef!  Each dish whether appetizer or dinner was better then the previous!  Octopus was perfectly cooked, tender and melt in your mouth, Squid perfectly crisp, Lamb succulent, tender and juicy, Pasta and Shrimp, Salads__ everything was perfectly seasoned and perfectly prepared and/or cooked.  
Drinks were innovative and different, Bartenderess was great.  All around Enjoyable Evening"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. The ambiance is great as it feels like you're at a dinner party at someone's house. I really enjoyed all the food we ordered - the baked goat cheese was perfectly flavored, the truffle polenta was appropriately rich, and the korma tacos were surprisingly tasty. The coffee creme brûlée desert was also a hit, not overly sweet and perfectly textured. The service was great and it was nice to see the owner coming around and introducing herself. Overall, a great neighborhood restaurant that I hope  to frequent again."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant for a Friday evening. Nice ambience, excellent food and drinks. Service can be iffy on busy days, but a great place for dinner overall. I probably come here 3-4 times a year"}
{"text":"First time at Felice. Warm night in CLE. Enjoying dinner and drinks outside in the outdoor patio area, which is one of the best things about the place. Probably my favorite thing about the place. The night was packed with a mix of old and young people. It seemed like everyone was enjoying themselves.

Service is really great. I spent time at the bar, ordering drinks, having a good time. The hostess and bartenders were more than accommodating, filling our glasses with wine and helping us with recommendations off the dinner menu.

Started off with a few appetizers: calamari, mussels, and the quail. All very good, but the quail is undersized. Dinner, I ordered the skirt steak, it was alright, but my mistake. I probably ordered the wrong thing. Everyone else seemed satisfied and happy with their orders. Next time I'm around I'll probably try the bouillabaisse.

Most likely come back here. Definitely a cool place."}
{"text":"Have to admit, I was so happy after my last visit that I grabbed another girlfriend and we met up last week again. Same great atmosphere, Same fantastic food and drinks and Same fabulous service. She actually had alcoholic beverages (Moscow Mules to be exact) and said they were delicious; I myself was drooling over them, but was happy with my perfectly blended \"mock\"talls. Absolutely cannot wait until summertime when I get to check out their patio.........
We are now obsessed. This is trendy done sooo right."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places. We hadn't been there since the management change. We will not go back. We arrived at 6:30 and sat on the patio. Our server was very friendly and took our drink and dinner orders. We both got the $25 Wednesday special (appetizer, main course, dessert). We got our drinks pretty quickly. The appetizers arrived around 7. The mushrooms and salad were fine. By 7:30, we had not received our main courses. We also had not had our water refilled or seen our server during this time. When we finally got our server and asked about our food, she said they only had three cooks working and they were backed up. There were at least two tables that arrived after us and were served more quickly (and had more people). Around 7:45, we finally got our dinners. The bar-b-que chicken was ok, nothing special. The vegan taco was fair. For dessert, I got the creme brûlée, which was ok but too sweet. My friend got the cheesecake. It was inedible. While we had to track down our server all night for our food, the bill arrived right after dessert was served. Because of the inattentive service and fair to poor food, we won't be returning.  It makes us sad as we want to support our neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"What a HUGE disappointment this restaurant was!  This was my first time eating at Felice on Saturday night (May 3rd)  My date and I stopped in for the Reverse Happy Hour and sat at the bar upstairs.  We both ordered appetizers and drinks.  My appetizer was fine but one of the two appetizers my date ordered was less than appealing.  He voiced his dissatisfaction and all our bartender could say was \"Sorry about that!\"  No effort to correct the situation.

I  ordered a glass of Merlot and he informed me that they were out of Merlot but had a Cabernet available.  I declined and asked him specifically, \"What white wines are available on the Happy Hour Menu?\"  He named several including a Riesling which is what I chose.  Happy Hour wines were $6.  When the bill came, my glass of Riesling was $9!  I brought this to his attention as he had named the Riesling as a Happy Hour wine choice and all he could tell me is, \"Oh, I misunderstood you, sorry there is nothing that I can do about that!\"  Really?  I think the question was quite clear.

Felice just lost two customers and we will definitely let our friends and family know about our terrible experience here.  Arrogance and poor customer service is unacceptable in my book."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have found this neighborhood spot! Stopped in for happy hour yesterday and was nothing but impressed. Their specials were great on drinks and their small plates for $5,6 or 7 were not only delicious but very large for the price!  The house is amazing and I can't wait to see what they do with it in the summer time.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to this hidden gem and I'm so glad I was able to experience it and the great food and delicious cocktails! The service was excellent and accommodating to a newcomer like myself. I left feeling so satisfied and can't wait to bring other friends and family to this cute house!"}
{"text":"New bar (inside) upstairs....wooohooo! It's a nice bar, but make sure to verify the cost of drinks, $9 malbec was pretty steep and added up quickly. As one of the younger clientele (27 yrs), I find that there are conflicting messages between the prices and the hip vibe that they're working to give. Regardless, my girlfriend lives down the street and it is (in my opinion) the best place to hang out in the Shaker Square area.

In the summer, the outdoor bar is awesome, and makes for a nice evening outside.

The food is great, if you order the right things. I recommend piling up on the small plates and doing it during happy hour. They have a reverse happy hour that starts at 10pm and ends at 1am...yum. Specials include cheap PBR (surprise) and slightly cheaper expensive cocktails. (Read: the food is a much better deal than the drinks at happy hour.)"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to finally trying Felice as my fiancé spoke so highly of it. We just left and let me explain my experience. We walked in and the dining room was about 65% empty, however, we were told that they were sold out but we could go upstairs in the first come first serve section with a full menu. Ok, fine no problem, just happy to finally see what Felice was all about. We sit down at a table with rolled silverware and we wait. While waiting, there was blaring loud punk rock music that in my opinion didn't go with the charming decor, but whatever. We waited for about 5-7 minutes, and no one ever greeted us. We quietly left, and we will never be back. I especially feel bad for my fiancé because he was a huge fan and was excited for me to experience the place. Even if we were required to walk to the bar to order, someone could have told us. We're on our way to Flour in Moreland Hills where we always get great service."}
{"text":"We have been there twice now. It is our new favorite place around shaker square. The staff is super nice. The food is all local with delicious salads and herbs. Try the ceviche (amazing lime and cilantro dressing). The garden patio serving  area in back is very pleasant and the interior is romantic. The food is just as good or better as the big names around shaker square such as Fire etc. and the atmosphere is more casual and relaxing. A must go if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm leaving Cleveland in a week and we decided to give this place one last try. It was my favorite restaurant when I first moved here 4 years ago, then it went though a rough patch. I'm happy to say we came for late night happy hour and the food was really good, the prices were on point, and the service was much better. Glad we are leaving Felice on a good note!"}
{"text":"Reverse Happy Hour review:

What a cute little restaurant located on Larchmere! Came specifically for the late night happy hour, dubbed \"Reverse Happy Hour\" and was blown away with how amazing my food was. We read that it starts from 10 to close, but the late night menus that we got said 9 until close. Not sure the official start time. I ordered the soft truffle polenta ($6) which was the right amount of creaminess balanced by the amount of freshness added by the veggies. I also couldn't help myself and had to get the mixed pickles ($3). They might vary from season to season, but mine had picked red onions, red bell peppers, cucumbers, and jalapeños. I loved the heat and crunch that the jalapeños added to the pickle mix! I was so stuffed by the time they brought out the dessert menu, but I tried the coffee creme brulee ($6.50) that my friend ordered. We were ecstatic at the bold coffee flavor that really cut through the sweetness of the dessert. 

Overall, what a great way to end the week!  If you're looking for a chill late night evening, go to Felice and sit on the porch for the \"reverse happy hour\""}
{"text":"Yelp should automatically reject any postings that include, \"Chased away 4 white collar clients\". What a pretentious and classless (pun intended) thing to say. Who cares how rich the reviewer is? Bad service is bad service, and good service is good service. It does not matter who is being served and it is indeed pretentious to assume that two different people walking into the same restaurant deserve different levels of service for the same product/service simply because they come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Excuse me for wanting people to treat their fellow man/woman with the respect they deserve. If you had bad service, just say so, nobody cares how much money was in your bank account when you had bad service."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Felice through an email flier for a happy hour in the Shaker Square region.  Not precisely easy to find, hue of the building and the understated nature of the signs outside set the mood of a more private location.

Smartly printed happy hour menus were arranged on the bar top, and I sat myself at a corner, and ordered Calamari, a lamb burger, and an orange inspired Manhattan.  Short pleasantries were exchanged with the waitstaff who were friendly and brisk.

Outside on the patio seating, a group of four ate and chatted.  During my time, a couple additional parties came and went.  The happy hour crowd never showed.

I would have left at this point, and bid adieu to this charming, slightly dimly lit house nee restaurant, except that the owner, Margaret, decided to say hello.

After she introduced herself, we exchanged many a story -- which I won't recapitulate here -- they are, after all, her stories.  However, it's important to note that she's an amazingly energetic octogenarian.  We had some chats about politics, life in Cleveland, travel and the like.

Suddenly, the personality of Felice made more sense to me.

3 glasses of Malbec, An order of short ribs, shoestring fries and shrimp (Thanks to the Chef!), I had a completely different impression.  The head chef is from the Culinary Institute of America and an affable fellow.

The new order was excellent.  

So:
Calamari - included mature squid parts as well as baby squid; both fried in a light batter and served with a lemon-heavy dipping sauce.  Relatively light for Calamari -- didn't make one feel particularly heavy when finished.

Lamb Burger - served with a bernaise sauce.  I had mine cooked medium.  Tender, not too gamy.  Tasty.

Short ribs - a tiny bit on the drier side, but still very flavourful.  Great taste.  They were served on very tasty fries.

Shrimp - not sure how to describe these, but they were an hors d'ouvres kind of preparation, served on a bread wafer.  Very tasty.

I had a great time here.  Will definitely go back.  Intimate environment."}
{"text":"Felice might just become a go-to place for happy hour!

This was my 2nd time going to Felice, and it was such a nice complement to my birthday dinner (see other review.)

Here's why I really enjoyed it:

- Cool, autumnal art display on the front lawn 
- My friends and I sat in the back patio, which is still really nice for a brisk fall day. It was both cozy and and cool. We were seated at a table next to the bar. I think the ambiance was definitely the best part.
- They have HEAT LAMPS!
- Their happy hour specials are $3-5 per dish with generous portions. We shared a bunch and we were very full by the end! Some favorites: pizza with sage pesto and butternut squash, poached mussels, warm goat cheese, and the seafood taco was overall just ok, but the salmon was very tender. Jalapeno bites were spicy but good! I really like the spicy jam that accompanies the goat cheese and jalapeno things.
- Another plus: they have reverse happy hour from 10pm-1am on the weekends!

Overall, I had another great experience. Everyone, please come to Felice!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! One of our favorite places to eat in Cleveland. We usually enjoy the \"small plates\" offered at happy hour which are so good it hurts. Recommend taking advantage of their Wednesday dinner special as well.(it rules)."}
{"text":"Great food at a great venue!! Felice is a revamped Shaker Heights home decked out with gorgeous chandeliers and vintage wooden furnitures. 

We started our dining experience with the grilled octopus and calamari! The grilled octopus had a very ceviche-feel to it, rich in citrus and lime flavors. Be warned though, there are very few pieces of octopus. It's an appetizer, so you can't expect that much more I guess. The calamari was also really delicious, perfectly crispy! The dipping sauce was a mixture of sweet and savory! Both are great appetizers!! I chose the duck breast as my main course. I was surprised by how little food came on my plate. There was a small piece of duck along with a spoonful of mashed potatoes and 4 pieces of brussel sprouts. I got my duck medium, which is what the chef prefers. The duck was rich in tangy flavor, very tender and juicy! It had a nice crispy skin as well. The brussel sprouts were nicely seasoned, not too salty or overpowering. Wish there were more pieces though! The mash potatoes were so-so. It could use a little more salt or other seasoning  because it tasted rather bland. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at Felice! 

Apparently there are three stories, but I only explored the first floor and was already impressed! The servers are all super chill and friendly, dressed in casual clothing, so don't be scared to be comfortable!"}
{"text":"Personal mark ? i had duck breast and it is really good !!! I'd like to visit again and have the duck breast again !"}
{"text":"I'm split between three and four stars. The house and the patio out back with the outdoor bar is really cool. But the taste of the food isn't cutting it for me. Also it's kind of expensive and small plates. Like the nachos were about two chips for each person. The service can sometimes be good but then sometimes a table of 6 can sit a while with no drinks. For me it's been hit or miss here."}
{"text":"This is a great venue in a restored house with 3 floors, each of which has its own distinct personality. The place has a great atmosphere. The food was excellent and the crowd was a great cross-section of diversity, young and old. The food took a long time to arrive but it was a busy Saturday night so the kitchen deserves a bit of slack. Both my friend and I really enjoyed our meals and found everything to be fresh and full of flavor. The noise level is a bit high but you could still have a conversation."}
{"text":"A few of the girls and I went here last night before going to a movie.  We stopped in during Happy Hour, so we were told to go upstairs for the happy hour section. The layout of the restaurant is quaint; it's in a house transformed with tables and a nice bar.  We chose to sit at the bar, and the bartender came over right away and gave us the happy hour specials menu.  Cocktails were $6.50 and all food was $5 or under, so we really liked the prices!  I tried the Felice Rita which was refreshing with the grapefruit and lime flavors complimenting each other well.  I then ordered the burger with aoli.  The downside to the happy hour menu was that you aren't able to change the dish at all, so adding cheese to the burger would have upped it to a \"normal priced\" option (adding about $4 for a piece of cheese).  The burger itself was thick and juicy, and I LOVED the aoli, so that was worth the $5 price tag.  We then tried another drink advertised as a \"spritzer\" so I pictured something light, fruity, and delicious... That was definitely not was was delivered.  It was overpowered by thyme and did not agree with our pallets so much that we actually asked for another drink instead (and I never send things back for any reason).  The bartender was really nice and accommodating about it though.  The warmed goat cheese dish was the best part of the meal... there is a kick to the tomato jam that makes the goat cheese pop, and the crustini is perfect!  Overall, a good value"}
{"text":"I'm willing to update my review at a later time but based on my first visit, I am not a fan. Ill start with the positive. The ambiance was chill. We arrived at 6:44p. Placed our cocktail order at 6:50 and received our 2 cocktails and 1 beer at 7:15p. A 25 minute wait for sub par drinks. It took another 15 minutes for the check. We didn't order food just based off of how long it took to receive our drink order. At the end of the day, I just didn't feel that welcome. Can't explain it but some people will understand that comment."}
{"text":"I love Felice!  The food is delicious, there are delicious vegetarian options and the atmosphere is lovely and cozy in the winter and refreshing and glorious in the summer!"}
{"text":"This rating is based only on happy hour, which was awesome. The food is nice (except for the shrimp \"lobster\" roll, our table didn't really care for it). I recommend the seafood taco, mussels, calamari, and warmed goat cheese. The drinks are a tad strong (in a good way)...nice and smooth. The decor is \"adorable\" and the music selection was perfect thanks to pandora...Dave the bartender had Ella Fitzgerald radio playing on his iPhone. Except for a few misses, like the phone ringing to interrupt pandora lol, this place is easily 5 stars for happy hr. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"While trying to find a reasonably priced restaurant close to us, we came across Felice on Yelp! And what a good decision we made to show up here. Since other yelpers mentioned the Happy Hour dubbed \"Reverse Happy Hour,\" we decided to call and check what time that starts. The time changes from 9pm to 10pm and runs till
Midnight so cal and check.

Their menu changes frequently but you can get a glass of wine for $5, beers from $2, and cocktails from $6. Hard to beat those prices.... Their food options are also very reasonably priced: $4-$6. I believe the Happy Hour menu is served at the bar upstairs, but you can still order from the regular priced menu.

This place is a quaint little three story house which has been converted to a restaurant. Top floor has red painted walls, which look pretty cool.

We sat at the bar upstairs (no elevator), and ordered wine and a Moscow mule. There was no dearth of vodka in the MM and the bartender was super friendly and attentive! For food we got the goat cheese, burger, tacos and calamari. I cannot say I did not enjoy each and every item. For the price you don't get better!

Definitely a place worth trying late night if you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now for work events, and I am thoroughly impressed and excited to return on my own terms. 

To start with the space, it is gorgeous. Well decorated. Not expansive, but doesn't feel small, either, even with 40 people packed in to one room.

The staff are exceedingly courteous and, even though our party was bigger than expected, still made room for everyone to sit.

And now, most importantly: The food. I've tried multiple dishes here. The baked goat cheese is probably my favorite. It was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and came with fantastic bread. The calamari was similarly great, although I'm categorically not as big a fan of calamari. The roasted mushrooms were rich and juicy, and I couldn't get enough. The brussels sprouts melted in my mouth and could have been an entire entree on their own. 

For entrees, the macaroni and cheese (which they kindly made without chorizo as I don't eat sausage) was scrumptious, and came with a fantastic grape jam on top. The tofu dish (I forget the exact name) had a delicious spice crust that elevated it.

For dessert, I've tried the banana bread pudding and the coffee-orange creme brulee. Both were fantastic. I dislike coffee and still found the coffee-orange creme brulee amazing.

I am so excited to return, and we'll see how things are when I get some more choice of dish!"}
{"text":"This place was lovely. We came here for date night and sat upstairs at the bar because the downstairs was full. We were able to cozy up in the corner of the bar and eat some good food. The bartender was polite and attentive while giving us enough space to be with each other. 

We shared the Stone Oven Bread with Herb Butter, which was tasty, and the Mixed Pickles, which were really good! I also had the House Caesar and the Garlic Shrimp. The salad was pretty standard, but the shrimp was delicious! I considered ordering it twice because it was so good and kinda small. My boyfriend ordered the Mac & Cheese and of course I had some. It was also really good, and unexpectedly sweet because of the apple and jam. 

Assuming we'll be able to find parking again, we'll come back."}
{"text":"I went here with a few of my friends for happy hour after reading reviews from my other friends' pages. I gotta say the food was mediocre and not the best I've tasted. Service at the bar was good but walking to the hostess or multiple wait staff was a bit awkward and we all sensed a bad vibe. Apparently, you couldn't sit at any of the tables out by their patio unless you had a reservation. So we headed to the bar area and another employee told us that it that we could so we headed back, and the guy who looked like he was in charge said it wasn't. So miss-communication from their employees already posed a negative about them. So happy hour is only serviced at the bar area only. There's only so much space you get so don't expect like a huge bar area like your traditional bar and grill restaurants. This place is a house which is a dining area + outside sitting and the barn area is the bar basically. 

They had up to $6.50 on cocktails such as their Roman Holiday, Moscow Mule, Pimm's Cup. Not really a deal since they usually run around 7-8 bucks, regular price. However, on their food selection for happy hour, pretty good selection. If i remember there was about ten or fifteen items to choose from. Ribs, mussels, oysters, wings, etc were some sample small plates. My friends ordered their mussels, stuffed clams, ribs. Mussels were pretty good but the stuffed clams was a disappointment. Not very generous of the portion, it was literally just tiny clams barely stuffed with anything. Oysters with ginger tasted very fishy and it didn't seem they cleaned it thoroughly so I was easily grossed out. 

The place is located off of a residential street so it is off of major intersections so it's one of those hidden places in the East side of Cleveland. Other cool places to eat is the Lava Lounge and I would definitely go there instead of Felice. Another great place is Fat Cats which I have yet to try. 

I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Felice has been on my short list of places to try for some time.  I finally got a chance to visit with a girlfriend, this past weekend.  I glad that I thought to make a reservation, because the restaurant was pretty busy on a Saturday night.  I arrive a few minutes ahead of my girlfriend, and was immediately, greeted and seated.  A number of the surrounding tables were occupied by vegetarians, based on the questions and food orders.  There seemed to be quite a few options for vegetarians.   My friend arrived and we proceeded to order.  I LOVE empanadas, so I ordered the mushroom empanadas, and the meatloaf entrée.  The empanadas were good, not the best that I've had, but worth re-ordering.  The were fresh, and nicely stuffed, but the mushroom taste didn't stand out.   My entrée was really good.  The meatloaf was nicely seasoned and grilled to perfection.  The portion was generous.  The meatloaf was served on top of homemade Yukon Gold potatoes with a side of yummy brussel sprouts.  My friend had the salmon with curried vegetables, and enjoyed her entrée, as well.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING FROM FELICE
I am really remiss to right this review, but the way I was treated in the aftermath of what happened, left me speechless. I am a regular there and generally go either late night Friday or Saturday after work with my girlfriend or just by myself. I will also go in there with her for dinners or their3 for 22 deal. However, last night, I came in about 12 and I ordered a drink and then a grilled cheese. I have had the grilled cheese before and enjoyed it. I had already finished my drink by the time the grilled cheese got there and felt fine. After eating a few bites of the grilled cheese, I did not, but I thought maybe it was just my stomach telling me I was hungry...I had just gotten off work from an 8 hour shift so I wasn't sure. Anyway, I only ate half and eventually left. As soon as I got home I tried to sleep...I couldn't my stomach was just so in knots and I knew I was going to throw up...I was up all night waiting and anticipating throwing up, it finally happen at 5 in the morning! I thought okay finished, then got the feeling again, immediately, and then 2 hours later threw up more and finally an hour after that at around 8 am threw up whatever remained from the sandwich (my body wanted it gone!!) So at this point, I haven't slept and felt miserable; headache, mild fever, and my legs were really sore. So I decide to call felice just to let them know what happened so either they can be a little more careful in the future or at least let them know something happened. I leave a message, not angrily, just matter of fact and when I got a call back, was I in for a surprise. I think it was either a manager or chef but HE WAS SO RUDE! He actually told me that it couldn't have been there fault; that it could not have been food poisoning, it must have been the flu and that since he was a nursing major, he would know...CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT!? he was actually trying to tell me I was wrong, instead of simply apologizing! That was so uncalled for. If he were going to call back it should have been a simple apology, and then maybe a free drink or something when I come in, but It definitely should not have been a call telling me I am wrong. So I just wanted to let you all know how I was treated after I GOT FOOD POISONING FROM FELICE"}
{"text":"We tried to give it a chance,  but every step of the way was painful. Were seated and wait-people avoided eye-contact for 20 minutes 'til we finally flagged one down. Our server showed up and said it was \"confusing\" that night.  Ok, fine. We ordered drinks, and then she came back 15 minutes later with no drinks and asked if we knew what we wanted, and we ordered. Another 20 minutes and our salads came out-  no drinks yet. Then the meals came, and they were spectacularly ordinary. This was not an inexpensive meal. Then the drinks came. One of my party ordered a second drink, since the first was served in a champagne flute of about 3 ounces ($10). That second drink never came. 
   Lousy service, lousy food, lousy attitude. Not going back."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a half-dozen times and each time it's been superb!  Fresh ingredients, creative, good vegetarian & vegan options, better food and atmosphere than places that are twice the price.  I've not ordered the same thing on any visit, and the food has been consistently excellent.

We had a bit of a wait for an outside table (not surprising), but just ordered a bottle of tasty zinfandel at the bar. The outdoor patio is both homey and hip; very comfortable and quiet enough to have a good conversation.

We love you Felice!"}
{"text":"Went for reverse happy hour, and, like many others have noted,  wish the place still stayed open later than midnight. Great atmosphere,  cool/unique setting, especially for the east side.
Bartender was not helpful, fairly arrogant and definitely not accommodating. Food he recommended was not as described, wine he quoted as part of the happy hour was charged at full price...made zero effort to make things right, instead going with \"it's rung up in the system already\". Customer service fail!"}
{"text":"Surprised to see only a four star average for this place. I've dined here twice now, and each time walked away thinking this is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. I appreciate the simplicity and uniqueness of the menu, in addition to the amazing food. The owner is such a sweet lady who clearly loves running this place. 
The octopus appetizer is fantastic...light, refreshing, and incredibly flavorful, and the Korean BBQ ribs are some of the most tender and delicious ribs I've had anywhere. 
The reverse happy hour let's you taste smaller portions of many items on the menu and is an amazing value. I'm a big fan of the fact that the restaurant is a converted home which has quite a bit of history. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Some friends and I decided to try happy hour at Felice, since we had been to Fat Cats several times and Felice is closer to where we live in Cleveland Heights. Some got there before others of us and ordered drinks, and when the rest of us arrived, there seemed to be no chance of getting a table. We made a reservation at a place down the street and decided to stay until the others finished their drinks and closed their tabs. However, we were told there was a table for us when we were getting ready to leave, and decided to stay. Big mistake.

I'll start with the good: the food is good, they have a great happy hour menu, and the drinks are good. The patio is beautiful when the weather is good, and the atmosphere is great.

The service, on the other hand, has been sub-par both times I've been. The first time, my group spent 3 hours there for happy hour. The waiter was rarely anywhere to be found, and screwed up virtually everything imaginable. Drinks came out a half hour after they were ordered (which didn't happen until we had already been there for 15 minutes), and when I asked to order another one right away so that I could get it before happy hour ended, I was told I had to finish the one I had first. Of course, that could have happened easily if my drink were brought out in a timely manner (it was simply a beer, not even a cocktail that had to be made). Appetizer orders were taken when drinks came out and didn't appear for nearly an hour, and there were some mistakes and some missing dishes. When it came time to pay, the waiter split the check incorrectly multiple times even though we laid out who ordered what when we requested the check. We were already disgruntled at this point, having spent far more time there than originally planned and having canceled plans for the evening due to the amount of time our \"happy hour\" was taking. To add to that, our waiter was not courteous and did not apologize for his horrible service, and did not compensate us. The owner stopped at our table earlier that afternoon and announced that she was about to go to the casino, which had recently opened, so we had no one to direct complaints to. The only good point of the evening was when our server forgot to carry over the bar bill that two people who got there early had accrued, although that was no consolation to those of us who did not order from the bar. I went back for one drink one evening, which still took longer than it should have even though the place was nearly empty and would close in about a half an hour. I doubt I will be returning to Felice.

I would recommend that those interested in Felice go to Fat Cats in Tremont. It's owned by the same people, has a similar menu and ambience (but is a bit smaller), and I've never had a problem there. The servers aren't always the most courteous, but we have always been satisfactorily taken care of."}
{"text":"Amazing eclectic menu, great flavors, cool decor, friendly service.  I sat in the outside bar area.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very solid place in great neighborhood.  Good beers and cocktails.  Great outdoor seating in warm months and cozy atmosphere when it's cold. Spotty service, but good is good. Would return."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The staff were really good, polite and accommodating (they even hung out with my 1 yr old). We ordered the goat cheese, the lentil taco and bread/herb-butter. The goat cheese easily stole the show, great taste. The taco had fresh ingredients and was a delight too. 

Overall a great experience, although slightly overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Some things pretty good, others particularly awful. Was excited about this place.
I and a friend had the 3 course for 25, with an extra starter of oysters.
My friend is deathly allergic to honey and carrots and tells the waitress this upfront. Oysters, gazpacho and octopus all pretty good, not mind blowing, but pretty good. The gazpacho was maybe pretty good plus.

We both got the porkchops which come on a bed of rice cooked in red stuff and greens [edit: was talking to my wife and she pointed out that they never asked us how we wanted our chops]. Apparently the red stuff includes carrots. Both orders of chops come with carrots cooked in with the rice. My friend notices them in time due to years of habitual checking and we avoid an ER trip (we did, foolishly, leave his epi-pen at the hotel, shame on us) and returns his 'chop. Now, his 'chop had a line of browning on one edge and by the bone but my chop was almost totally brown and hard on one side. You'd think knowing both chops were going to the same table you'd burn both and make them look the same, but nah. Then to top it all off the \"steak knives\" which are really butter knives are just not enough to cut the 'chop. I'm shaking my hipster outdoor metal table all over the place trying to cut my 'chop and leave after they tried to kill my friend. 

Dear Felice, Get some actual steak knives. Especially if you intend to serve burned 'chops. 

Dessert. My friend sent his entree back and they took it and his starter off the bill. He skipped dessert lest it have surprise honey in it. I had the ginger-something cheesecake but could not detect any ginger. It had orange colored fruity stuff (maybe apricot?) and berries around it that was ok. The cheesecake itself wasn't any better than what you get at Aladdin's but the plate was prettier and you could smoosh it in the schmear, meh.

Very underwhelmed. As usual, I shoulda had the bacon cheeseburger. 

Waitress was kind of around when we needed/wanted her. Guy refilling water was on point. Drinks: again pretty good but not mind blowing"}
{"text":"I'd like to request your avocado soup, but I think they lost the recipe. Tacos were grisly and shells were doughy. And hot-spicy does not mean flavorful. Great atmosphere. Other then these two points overall a darn fine restaurant!"}
{"text":"Felice was awesome tonight. We sat at the bar outside and enjoyed drinks and appetizers. The food was excellent. We had the Vegan Plate. The vodka drink with grapefruit and lillel on the rocks was perfect for a summer night. And the service was outstanding. I wish I knew the bartenders name but made an awesome drink.

What's great about Felice is that despite great food and great booze you feel completely comfortable just hanging out.

It's a treasure."}
{"text":"This is really one of the most innovative restaurants in Cleveland. The staff is friendly and the owner is so passionate about the food....which is awesome! I'm a vegetarian, my boyfriend is not, and rarely do we find such a great mix in Cleveland that actually tastes as good as it looks. The cauliflower poboy and fava bean stew were exceptional!"}
{"text":"Felice came soooo close to earning a 5-star rating from me, and I'm not sure what's holding me back! Maybe after my next visit I'll be able to bump it up  :)  but until then..

I came here for happy hour mid-week  and loved the cozy feeling inside. We sat at the bar and I had a moscow mule which was great - one of the better versions I've had! We had a few of their happy hour appetizers - the goat cheese was INCREDIBLE, and I thought that the crispy chick peas were just okay.. until I realized that I couldn't stop eating them. They're addictive! We also got the mussels which were fantastic (the broth was delicious) and a pizza with zucchini and olives - also great. And their discounted happy hour prices are phenomenal - really great deals!

Overall, I can't wait for my next visit to Felice. My goal is to sample everything on their amazing happy hour menu.. and even though it's a pretty large menu, I'm sure it won't take me too long to make my way through it."}

This review will not be based on alcoholic beverages.


Pros: 
Felice is a refurnished house with happy hour on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The first floor is reservations and regular dinners. The atmosphere is cozy as a house should be, and at the same time roomy and spacious, especially on the 2nd floor. On the 1st floor, they have a patio = a really nice touch, id imagine in the fall or summer nights. 
 
This might just be one of the best happy hour places in Cleveland. Happy hour menu consists of over a dozen food items all prices from $3-5. The burger was somewhat dry (i always order medium), but the CHEESE was to die for. The lobster/shrimp? roll was quite delicious. The stuffed clams with manchego cheese was delicious. They only give you 3. The clams themselves could be a little less dry. They were not burnt by any means, but they were a bit ...crunchy...

Finally, the service was absolutely phenomenal. The waiter we had was very considerate. Orders came quickly. No hassle. I asked for a dessert menu. 10 seconds later he came. I asked for the check. 15 seconds later, it was given.

Speaking of desert...they have 4 options. We just shared the creme brulee, which was very good. Why was it good? the creme was not overly sweet, and had good consistency. The caramel layer was EVENLY distributed, and thin enough where it was easy to break with the spoon. Melts in your mouth. 


Cons: 
Everything was good. But was it phenomenal? it certainly wasn't the best burger, asparagus, lobster roll, stuffed clam that i ever had, but it was good ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE.

The portions were small, but what do you expect from a $3/4 plate of asparagus?...wihch also came with scattered olives.

What can be improved. have the creme brulee, which right now comes with raisins (good touch), instead come with fresh BLUEBERRIES. trust me on this if the restaurant people ever read this. Either dry them thoroughly and put them on top, or some with a small side."}
{"text":"This is a staple in my list of favorite places to drink and dine. It has so much charm. My preference is to sit upstairs in the bar. The happy hour selections are great. They change their menu frequently; it's always a pleasant surprise when you stop in. I've had everything from sauteed brussel sprouts, mac and cheese, perogies with a balsamic reduction sauce, hamburger, fries, etc. EVERYTHING has always been top notch. 

Cocktails are fantastic too. 

I recommend going either on a date or for girls night. Pick a few things off the happy hour menu and share share share! The atmosphere is very chill and it's easy to carry on a conversation with the person you came with. No having to yell over the cacophony at Felice. 

Service has always been great here. The owner, Margaret, usually comes around to the tables to genuinely ask how your dinner was. It makes my night just to see her. Her passion for what she provides to her patrons really warms my heart. She gives this place her all. It's fabulous to have a restaurant like this in my own back yard."}
{"text":"There was a group of 5 of us that visited here for happy hour.  We missed it by 30 minutes.  Instead of just leaving we decided to stay, have a drink and browse the menu.  This was all of our first time here.  Although we didn't eat I wanted to review because we didn't get that great of service while we were there.  It was somewhat busy and despite only getting drinks, we waited close to 20 minutes to be served.  I don't want this one time to be a spoiler for the future but it seems this place isn't good for medium sized groups.  Maybe if it were two of us it would have been better.  To sit and have to find parking and then have subpar service sucks.  The waiter, although somewhat nice, wasn't no where as apologetic as the hostesses were.  I ordered a Paloma and it wasn't all that great.  It was a new drink off their new menu.  I think we should go back to the drawing board kids."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, so happy about this place. It's a different setting then some places, in an old house. It is pricey but the meals that I have allowed myself to indulge in were so delicious. Squash pierogies was the most memorable, and I still dream about them.

Cocktails are so very yummy, but a pretty penny. There is an awesome happy hour, 4-7 and an awesome patio to enjoy that.

Worth it."}
{"text":"Cozy and delicious.  Took \"the in-laws\" here and they loved it too."}
{"text":"4 words sum this up...\"AWESOME REVERSE HAPPY HOUR!\"

This quaint cafe is a perfect spot for some amazing late night food and drinks. The joint itself has a eclectic feel to it. A house converted into a restaurant, this isnt your modern, upscale eatery...but more like a visit to your favorite aunt's home for a scrumptious meal. 

We came here late Saturday night and decided to try the reverse happy hour which is served only at the bar located on the second and third floors. The first floor is for the more regular fine dining experience. The way the reverse happy hour works is that they have selected drinks and small plates costing $3- $6. The menu I am told changes on a regular basis. 

We started off with the moscow mule and the cabernet both top notch. For our main meal we did the hummus platter, goat cheese, veg taco, burger and the fried calamari. We wrapped up dinner with the bread pudding. Our meal was perfect! All the food tasted great. My favorite was the goat cheese and the veg burger. The goat cheese with the sweet tomato sauce in my opinion was the perfect sweet and salty balance. The bread pudding...not on the happy hour menu... was pretty good though i have had better. 

Our bartender/server was an absolute pleasure! He was entertaining, knowledgable about the food and made some great recommendations. We ordered a drink (not from the happy hour menu) and it was not added to our final bill. When we brought it to his notice he chose to not go back and add it and gave it to us on the house.....to me customer service does not get better than this! 

The cafe has some great outdoor and indoor seating options and if you are in the bar area you can move freely between both. 

Overall: A great experience....A must try for anyone in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"I'm a happy camper. I've been to Felice for brunch (which was great btw) a year ago, but had been meaning to check out happy hour here for a while. I finally got a chance to yesterday. (who doesn't love a Friday happy hour?) The hours stretch till 7 PM which is nice, and they even have late night happy hour starting at 10 on weekends.

I love that felice is in a cute old house on Larchmere, its warm, cozy, inviting, and always has good music playing.  Happy hour is upstairs and there is plenty of seating- at tables- for happy hour which is also nice.  I'll admit I sort of struck out with the food that I ordered, the shrimp/lobster roll, but my friends were more successful and I know what I'll be getting next time around. The shrimp roll was just bland, with too much aioli, gobbed onto a hot dog bun. Edible, but meh.  I got a taste of the other things my friends got though, like the goat cheese (amazing), veggie taco, hummus, and burger and all were great. As everyone mentioned, long HH food list + cheap prices = definite win.  And I'm not sure about the service complaints, it was perfectly fine for us. I'm going to make this one of my go-to HH places on the east side from now on!"}
{"text":"First impression this place is very loud. They need to install sound dampers so you don't have a headache before dinner. The menu  has a nice variety to choose from. We started with the small meat board. The soppressata was not edible. The rest of the cured selections where very good. We ordered the seafood bouillabaisse which needed flavor. The seafood was fresh but was missing flavor.   The server was outstanding she was professional and attentive. I will try it one more time because everyone has a off night. I would give it a solid 31/2 stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dining location in the Larchmere neighborhood!   Located inside a converted home, with multiple dining areas, our table was in a very cozy area.  Nice, diverse menu.  We had the meat and cheese board for an appetizer, and it was very nice.  Entree items were also diverse and well prepared.  Nice selection of pasta items.  Dessert items were excellent as well.  Good wine list, nice mixed drink selection.  Very good service.  Will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Felice is absolutely awesome! I came here for the first time with my parents for my birthday and it was well worth it. The food is great, and there are a ton of options, all of which sounded good. They also have a lot of gluten and dairy-free and veg/vegan options, which does not apply to me, but is nice for others. My dad and I each started with a cocktail, and they were very good. Both were creative combinations, but all the flavors worked really well together. For appetizers, we had the grilled octopus special (which is different than the sautéed octopus that was on the menu) and the pan-sautéed wild mushrooms. Both were great, but the mushrooms were really excellent. I have no idea was the sauce was, but it was delicious, especially if you got a bite of the cheese (goat?) in there also.

For entrees, my dad had a pasta special, shrimp pappardelle arrabbiata, my mom had the crispy squash polenta, and I had the pork belly sandwich, which came with sweet potato fries and tomato jam. I'll be honest, I would come back here just for the tomato jam. All of the food was so good, and portion sizes were great. Enough food without being way too much. Like the cocktails, the dishes were creative and delicious. We finished off with lemon ginger cheesecake, which was good, and the coffee creme brûlée, which was outstanding. I don't even like creme brûlée and I would eat 5 of these.

Other than the food, the ambience/atmosphere is pretty cool. It's an old converted house, and we were seated next to a fireplace in what was probably a living room. It was too cold to be outside in March, but they have an area for a patio too, which is probably pretty nice in the summer. The pricing was also great, especially for a kind-of fancy restaurant. Part of the reason I chose the place is because I always choose nicer (i.e. pricier) places when I know my parents are paying, and I didn't want to do that this time. We had 3 drinks, 2 apps, 3 entrees, 2 desserts, and 3 coffees, all for something like $130. And the quality of the food was definitely worth more than that. 

Felice is one of the best meals I've had recently. Interestingly, the last best meal I've had (about 5 months ago) and Felice both give out their checks in old books instead of a normal credit card sleeve/folder. So apparently anywhere that gives you your check in a book is worth eating at.

I would definitely recommend, and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the good. The third floor is pretty funky. Its set up like more of lounge and family style benches and couches.

Our service was very good. The woman who took care of us was attentive and efficient. 

I was quite surprised that they did not have bloody mary's.

Ok lets move to the \"not\" so good. I got a hangar steak.  The steak was decent and prepared to a perfect medium rare.  However for 21$ they should give you more than 4-5 ounces.  The side or spinach was about 3 bites work. The fries were ok

Another person in our party ordered the duck breast and it was very gamey and full of gristle.  It did not taste like duck. I really wanted to like this place however it was just no a very good value."}
{"text":"Pet friendly and happy hour was all I needed to hear. They have a great outdoor space with a shed converted to a bar. The vibe is completely laid back and friendly. The owner came by and said hello. The food on the happy hour menu was varied and all very tasty and reasonably priced. I was going to go for the burger but wanted to sample some other things; fish taco, calimari, Korean bbq ribs, and fries...all delish. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The menu changes seasonally here.  It's good and bad.  I like that there is variety but then there is inconsistency.  I love the chick pea melt, spring mix salad, and mac and cheese.  I tried the barbecue chicken today and was disappointed.  The flavors are just not harmonious.  I have had much better barbecue chicken in my life.  The portion is reasonable but the flavors fall flat.  The atmosphere here is great, I think I may need to stick my three staples on the menu to avoid being disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this spot as the setup is cozy/chill and the food is always good/creative.  Everything is fresh and full of flavor at at very reasonable price.  Happy hour menu is awesome and they also have some good dinner specials during the week."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We had crispy chick peas, stuffed clams, and warm goat cheese to start. Then barbecue ribs, poached mussels, and salmon tacos. Unreal!

Happy hour here is perfection. Does not get any better."}
{"text":"We stopped by Felice on the way to a movie, and found that an hour and a half was not really enough time--the food was excellent, but very, very slow in arriving. The patio is charming, and if we were planning to spend the a casual evening visiting the pace would have been fine. 

Unlike some other reviewers, we were provided with the happy hour menu when we were seated, and reminded of it when our waitress came to the table. So that problem seems to have been solved. We started with the hummus, which was a little on the lemony side for our tastes. I ordered the duck breast that was on the special, and it was some of the best duck I've ever eaten. My husband ordered the polenta, which was tasty though not as notable as the duck. 

The drinks were interesting and inventive, and the waitstaff was reasonably attentive. While this wouldn't be a destination dining choice for an evening, I certainly would be willing to dine here again."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Great atmosphere, excellent food with plenty of vegan - gluten free options and the Mac n cheese is insane. It's a neighborhood gem that can't be missed...the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Can't wait for them to open the new patio complete with glow in the dark bocce call and edible flowers. Oh and brunch too!"}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner, happy hours, and the Wednesday special and enjoyed it every single time. 

This is one of my top go to's for happy hour.  They have regular happy hour from 4-7pm and reverse happy hour from 10pm-2am on weekends.  The happy hour menu is extensive (albeit the dishes are small, kind of like tapas).  My favorites are the chicken wings, fried calamari, crispy chick peas, and barbecue ribs.  The burger is good if you want something more filling. But I've tried pretty much everything on the happy hour menu and liked it.  The cocktails here are delicious, not too sweet.  Off their regular menu I like the steak and frites and their tacos.  Their $22 3-course meal on Wednesdays is an awesome deal and I highly recommend it! Their molten chocolate cake is to die for (apple cobbler also delicious).

Besides the food, I love the ambiance here.  The outside patio is a must on warm summer nights. Open air, plenty of seats, and a covered area if its raining.  They also opened a new bar/lounge area upstairs that's a nice place to hangout during happy hour or to grab drinks.  The owner is super friendly and frequently makes rounds checking on how everyone's doing.  The service here is great and everyone is friendly and helpful. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I like that. I like that. Came here for happy hour on a Friday, first time in the Larchmere area. The places on Larchmere have a walkable, neighborhood feel with many businesses  operating out of classically old houses (Felice included). 

Felice has three stories in the \"house\" with the bar/happy hour area on the second floor. Very casual, relaxed setting and the happy hour prices are great. $3 craft beers, $6 cocktails and a variety of bites ranging from $5 to $7. I ordered a dark and stormy along with the spicy chicken sandwich ($6) and baked goat cheese ($7). 

The food was awesome and portioned very well despite the cheap pricing. The spicy chicken sandwich had a nice heat kick and the chicken was extremely tender and juicy. The baked goat cheese was served with crostinis and a tomato jam which was a favorful hybrid of pasta sauce with the viscosity and sweetness of jam. Love goat cheese in general and this was my first time having it baked. I will say the baked brie at Oak Barrel is better but at $7 happy hour pricing, well worth a try.

To top of the feeling of being in someone's home, the owner was at the bar and went around introducing herself to patrons. She was friendly and definitely seemed drunk. Cheers Madame! I will be back to Felice soon."}
{"text":"They fail to grasp the concept of HAPPY HOUR. Chased away 4 white collar clients over adding salt to one of 4 happy hour cocktails on their menu. Undoubtedly the fact that we were 1 of 2?tables during happy hour should tell them that their SAD HOUR attitude is causing the Jezebel's Bayou to be packed. Congrats and cheers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon and it was cooked to perfection... there was a nice crunch on the outside but the inside still remained nice and juicy!!! We sat at the bar outside and received excellent service!!! Great experience! Def worth the money and we will for sure be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved this homey little restaurant with a great vibe/environment.  This is exactly the type of eatery I would frequent if I lived in CLE.  The restaurant is literally located in an older house, so the building has tons of quirkiness if you're into that.  Full disclosure, I only tried an apple pear cobbler and a glass of wine of the pretty well-curated wine list.  The cobbler was delicious, especially a la mode.  I'll likely be back to try some entrees to augment this review."}
{"text":"I had a casual meeting here, just for drinks on a Tuesday night, and I really loved this place.

We sat at the outdoor bar, which appears to be in a renovated barn.  The bartenders were very attentive and knowledgeable.  They recommended some really fun and delicious cocktails.

I didn't get any food, and so can't speak to the quality of the food or service if you were to sit for a full meal, but the atmosphere is great and I will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Everything from the food to the service was excellent. I had the Korean BBQ ribs with calamari as an appetizer. So many great things on the menu to choose from. Hoping to go back soon."}
{"text":"A nice spot in Larchmere for dinner. The mushroom appetizer was OK. Really enjoyed the salmon entree, lots of flavor and a bit of spice. Went on a snowy cold night so will have to return in the warmer weather for the outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"The first meal I had at Felice was far & away one of the best meals I've ever had in Cleveland, if not at the very top of the list. 

We got off to a rocky start for a few reasons: One, the server immediately reminded us that they had other reservations coming in & so we couldn't \"linger\" after our meal. How off-putting is that? Luckily, she got a little friendlier from there. 

Second, I ordered a Manhattan, & our server soon returned to us to say that they were out of bourbon & couldn't make Manhattans. Huh. I declined to order another drink, but she did bring me a free glass of wine, which made up for it.

And finally, we planned to split two entrees, but our serve came back to us to tell us they were out of chorizo & did we mind if our mac & cheese was vegetarian? I can make vegetarian mac & cheese at home, so no, thanks. We put in a new order for the lamb shank papparadelle.

The good news is that everything was incredibly delicious. I'm sure that chorizo mac & cheese is great, but the lamb shank papparadelle was out of this world, & I couldn't be happier that we ended up with it. It's housemade pasta served with tomato, butternut squash, chevre, crispy brussels, pickled peppers, & a crostini on the side, a large enough portion that we took much of it home - & it was still delicious reheated. We also split the lamb tacos, which weren't as amazing as the pasta but which would've otherwise been a star entree: braised lamb shank, balsamic onions, gremolata, creme fraiche, cherry tomatoes, & crispy shallots. Yum! Very offbeat & different for tacos.

We also split an appetizer, the vegan tasting plate. Neither of us was sure it'd be up our alley, but my God, it was incredible. It included cranberry bean hummus, winter wheat berry tabbouleh, cauliflower kofta, house pickled vegetables, & plenty of grilled pita, & our love for it is the reason we had so much paparadelle leftover to take home! What an incredible - & incredibly unusual - appetizer.

The owner, a sweet & chatty older woman, came around at one point to introduce herself to each table & to make sure they were enjoying the food & the experience. That made up for some of the earlier issues. She's a gem! 

I also really like the feel of the restaurant itself, an old home where the dining rooms are still divided into floors of the house. It's got a homey, quirky, comfortable feel.

I look forward to going back to Felice, & I hope I eventually get to try that mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night with good friends great service from Sophie the goat cheese app and Brussels were killer, had the chorizo Mac and cheese different and very good, cool hip vibe I will be back"}
{"text":"This place was super cute, we are in town for New Year's Eve and happen to run across this last minute place. Me my brother sister and niece. We called ahead because it is New Year's Eve and figured they would be booked but we went around 6pm so they let us stay...we got the shrimp and goat cheese appz Both really yummy. I got the steak my sister got steak tacos and brother got lamb shank. We all were very impressed, the service was great and they were baby friendly which was nice. Prices were reasonable, portion sizes were big and very fresh food!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Especially in the summer!  It's so cute and so nice.  Indoors I have had some excellent experiences as well, cozy and warm.  Food is great, I have tried everything from fresh fish to the meat/cheese boards.  If in the area, or even if not - make a trip you will love it!"}
{"text":"Why didn't I come here sooner?

I'm a big fan of Lava Lounge - spent my birthday there this year - and although Felice is significantly closer to my house, I'd never been there.  But I dare say that I like Felice even more than I like Lava Lounge.  (maybe I need to try Fat Cats next?)  Set in a big old house in Shaker, this house is oozing with charm.  It's gorgeous on the inside yet eclectic at the same time.  The place was packed when we were there, so we sad in the 3rd floor lounge and it felt like we were sitting in a really funky rec room.  That probably sounds bad, but it was actually awesome.  There were comfy seats, benches, and small side tables for food everywhere.  And although we were away from the bar action, our server never let us go more than a few minutes without checking on us.  Not an easy feat considering how many people were there.

As others have mentioned, the happy hour at Felice is amazing.  A whole butternut squash pizza for $3?  A vegetarian taco for $3?  Plus plenty of other veg option all for under $5.  There are plenty of drink specials for happy hour, too.  My favorite drink of the moment - the Moscow Mule - is on that list and well worth the $6 happy hour price.  (oh, and it's a well made mule!)  

My meat eating boyfriend who loves seafood but not salmon also loved his seafood taco.  (I've known him for 7 years and this is the first salmon I've seen him eat and enjoy)  He also got the stuffed clams and said they were good, although not that filling.  We shared the stuffed jalapenos.  They were ok.  But It made me happy that we could find something to share.  And hey, even if we didn't love it all that much, it was a $3 appetizer!

I definitely plan on coming back for another happy hour (or reverse happy hour late at night) o try more of the vegetarian options.  Everyone around us was ordering all sorts of different dishes off the menu and everything looked and smelled great.  Definitely a must see if you're in the area - and especially if you're looking for a happy hour with veg options!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland... Whenever a friend comes out to meet me in the city, I make it a point to go there with them. That's how good. The menu selection is superb and ingredients are used in a thoughtful and unique way. The vegetable polenta is the most mind blowing thing I've ever tasted, and only recently have I began venturing outside of my little safety dish. Cant recommend this place enough!!"}
{"text":"Felice, I'm addicted to your french fries now.

Had to check out Felice the other day for dinner because (1) Other yelpers were raving about it and (2) I'm a big fan of Fat Cats, Ricardo Sandoval's other restaurant.

This is the first time I had ever driven down Larchmere Blvd, and I have to say the street itself looked kind of barren (though, maybe it was because a snowstorm was just starting).   However, Felice looked very warm, festive and inviting, with all of the people in the windows and the pretty Christmas lights.  It was a very homey feel.  I'd give this place a 6 for its decor.

Overall, the food at Felice was sort of hit or miss.  We actually did NOT like our calamari appetizer because it was unevenly seasoned (some pieces were too salty and some were totally bland), as well as overdone (read: chewy).  However, the entrees made up for it, as the barbeque ribs fell right off the bone and were very flavorful.  The ribs came with french fries (pommes frites), which, as I mentioned above, I was totally into.  They were cut into very thin slivers and had a nice crunch to them, such that they tasted like potato sticks (like the ones you can get in the supermarket in cans).  But these were a lot fresher and tasted fantastic.  This might be the first restaurant where I actually finished all of the french fries on the plate!  We also had the duck, which was marinated very well.  And the portion sizes were nice and large.

The service was very good, in the sense that they checked up on us quite often and consistently refilled my water.  However, the food took an extremely long time to come out of the kitchen.  I'd come here again, but be prepared for a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Felice is my go to spot for happy hour with friends.  The striking and funky decor of the third floor makes for a great backdrop to the start of an evening out.  They've managed to arrange the place in such a way that it's easy to accommodate groups of varying size, and it's perfect if people are coming and going from your gathering.  The food is great and insanely inexpensive during happy hour.  I recommend the goat cheese crostini ($4) or the grilled cheese ($4) with your favorite cocktail ($5). Can't wait to go back and sit outside!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night with the boyfriend. 

Quaint location, love that they grow their own vegetables in the garden next to the restaurant. 

Ordered the fried goat cheese with crostini. Oh man it was to die for. Highly recommend. The marinara served with it was delicious. 

Boyfriend ordered a venison dish that he really enjoyed. I ordered the macaroni and cheese with chorizo. Also fabulous. 

We also got a dessert too that was out of this world. 

Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Why did i ever think this place would not be good... The creative menu i guess threw me off a bit and the location compared to the rest of the great restaurants i have been to made me put this one off to the side... We have a friend who is vegetarian, and in looking for a place to accommodate both i reviewed the menu and suggested it.. Surprised to find out my vegetarian friend has never been here either.. This will not be our last time here that is for sure.... First off Margaret the owner is fabulous, she decided to get in to the restaurant business at 79 and 8 years later still going strong!  
For starters we had the cheese plate, sauteed calamari and brussel sprouts... The cheese place was amazing and well worth the 14 bucks, the calamari was so tender we will now call it calamari flavored pasta, its that good and tender.. The Brussel sprouts were good as everybody who ate them loved them, i did not.... I had the patty melt for my entree and wow.. The burger a bit over cooked still packed so much flavor it was delicious. My wife had the chorizo mac and cheese, which surprised me as she doesn't tend to like spicy... At the end she was wishing she had enough to take home because the chorizo was sooo good, but only scraps remained... My friends had the polenta which she raved about and her husband the fish tacos... Who uses swordfish in fish tacos, i will have to try next time because they looked and from what he said tasted amazing... Can not wait to come back here,"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour and we walked in as soon as it opened and were informed that it was happy hour on the second level. We showed ourselves upstairs to check out the menu and decided that we would partake.

We both ordered some drinks: a Moscow mule, a felice-Rita, and another whichever I can't remember the name of; but was TO DIE FOR. (I had 2)

For our entrees we got; warmed goat cheese, ribs, fried calamari, the flatbread, and a salmon taco. A lot, I know. 

Everything was so so so good. The warmed goat cheese should be illegal; it was the delicious. 

And during our meal the owner actually came over and introduced herself and talked to is for a minute. She was enjoying a martini herself.

It was an awesome experience and I definitely want to go back to try out their regular menu.

Oh! And in the summer she was saying that they open the backyard and have a bar in the barn with music and dancing and food! What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Felice is a very solid restaurant in the Cleveland area. I've been a few times and each time I have been pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very laid back and the cocktails are great. The third floor is really funky and is a great place to hang out with a big group of friends. The service is very good as well. The food has always been good, with the burger really standing out, but with the seasonal menu's you really don't know what you might be getting. Felice is definitely worth a try if you are looking for some good food and drink in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"A little over rated.  Staff was slow and we had to flag someone down everytime we wanted something.  This is my first bad review in years but when staff stands around when they have lots of tables and paying customers i have a hard time giving a good review.  Food was OK"}
{"text":"the food was sooooo good and the service was really really nice! I was there during nite time happy hour and the prices are supper cheap for the food i got. Thank you"}
{"text":"Felice is one of those places that you always keep in the back of your mind when in need of a last minute semi-fancy hang out for friends, co-workers, or significant others. I've been here many times, in the company of many different people and have never failed to have a great time! The venue is a cute little house with a mixture of seating options: small and large tables, outdoor patio seating, bar seating, and low arm-chair like seats. The service is good and the menu is very diverse. Must tries include the roasted brussel sprouts, goat cheese, fish tacos, and the house burger! Also don't feel that you have to order an entree, you can easily make a delicious meal out of a few appetizers!"}
{"text":"The service was fast, courtesy, and knowledgeable! The space was beautiful! Set in a restored turn of the century home in Cleveland's Eastside on Larchmere Blvd. 

The menu was just the right size and had a little bit of something for everyone. Everything on the menu sounded delicious! For my entree I had the Seared Salmon Special, perfectly prepared! Well-seasoned crispy surface and absolutely flavorful moist center! I ate everything off my plate, it looked like I licked it clean. The cocktail list was short with ahhhh-mazingly creative cocktails. I had the Lemon Jenny and it was delicious, a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and refreshing. They also had a very good wine and beer list.

Felice is a dinning experience must for anyone wanting something off the beaten path. It has a blend of urban, earthy, casual, luxe - hard to explain but, it's different in an extremely good way. I will definitely be back.

Tip: There's only street parking here so get here with time to find parking."}
{"text":"In short, the food at Felice is exceptional.  The kitchen delivers a unique mix of New American home cooked meals with a high end spin, and some  where mixed in there is a collection of authentic international cuisines.   Probably the only place in Cleveland you can have a mix of fresh shucked oysters,  homemade empanadas (yes, empanadas!), ribs and chicken, pierogis, and a seafood stew all in one sitting.  The kitchen has something for everyone. I can say Felice arguably has one of the best ribs, fried chicken, and empanadasI have tried in northeast Ohio.   This place is worth a visit.  

The environment of the restaurant can best described as a cozy ambiance similar to a traditional Irish pub.  Walking in to the restaurant, you would never expect the menu options it offers - I was already mentally prepared for a draft beer, pub burger, and a side a fries - when the menu was handed to me, I was in sheer awe at the number of different selections available - and honestly a bit skeptical at their ability to deliver.

Drinks - Lots of different signature cocktails available, but as a traditionalist, went with my standard manhattan.  Well done.  They have a lot of different fusion cocktails as well.  

Appetizers - Went with a wide range of options to try out as many selections as possible, the fresh blue point oysters were very fresh and had a great pairing with the home made mignonette.  We also tried both the beef as well as the mushroom empanadas.  Both were exceptional and one of the best I have tried - perfect balance of crispy and tenderness on the outside skin.  The inside filling was very flavorful.  Brussels sprouts were also very nicely prepared with a nice balance of sweetness with the raisins and bitterness of the vegetable.  The mushrooms with slices of break were also tasty.  The only appetizer which we were a bit iffy on was the octopus.  The octopus was not your typical preparation-it was small baby octopuses with head and tentacles together- not your typical preparation.  Not a dish to be ordered if you are not an adventurous eater. 

Foe main entrees, we went with the Asian inspired barbecue ribs.  Hands down, one of the best ribs I have ever had - they should take this recipe to the annual rib cook off.  Sauce was nice an tangy and the meat texture was fall off the bone tender.  Perfect amount of charring in the outside for that extra flavor.  We also ordered the Mac and cheese - not your grandmas Mac and cheese.  Hybrid spin with cranberry topping and interesting texture.  We also ordered the fried chicken which was amazing.  Great seasoning and crispy outside.

Overall loved the restaurant.  However, the menu and environment may be confusing to average diner - there is a wide range of food options and there is not a single cuisine that prevails - this may be the reason for lower customer volume at this time....Give it a try, the menu is not what you expect, and the rib, fried chicken, and empanadas are worth it!!  Truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"High quality food, top notch outdoor atmosphere - I would highly recommend adding Felice to your summer dining options in Cle.

Ate here before an Indians game (just ~15 minute easy shot to downtown).  All seating was outdoor, and it was eclectic, rustic industrial vibe.  Only improvement area is that seats aren't incredibly comfortable and it was a bit buggy (a few ants joined us at the table).

The food was delicious, albeit expensive, especially for Cle.  We had 3 appetizers and 4 entrees in the group of 4. You could easily go here just for appetizers and drinks since their \"starters\" menu options were all amazingly delicious.  We ordered a veggie tart, the house pizza, and sautéed brussel sprouts.

Apps are around $8-10 each.  Entrees are around $18-30 each and also tasty.  

The staff was friendly and Margaret, the owner, even came out and greeted the tables.  As we were leaving, it was neat to see people walking from around the neighborhood to dine here- true local gem.

If you're driving - watch out - street parking only, but there were tons of street spots when we arrived."}
{"text":"So Felice is one of my staple happy hours in Cleveland, however (and I know this sounds crazy) the HH is waayyy better in the winter than in the summer. For some reasons the portions are smaller and the quality of food is just not up to par in the summer. 
Good for both of us winter in Cleveland is about 9 months long so it usually a moot point. They do however have a very cute patio in the summer which occasionally makes up for the half sized portions. 

Regular menu wise the chorizo Mac and cheese is delicious. And i think they still have half off bottles of wine on Thurs! (I think!)"}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Felice with my family.  The house surprised me.  The fixtures, fireplace and open ceiling kitchen renovation kept me busy admiring as I had coffee and looked at the menu.  I had great romaine, St. Louis ribs and creme brulée, all favorites, all savory.  Even the coleslaw tasted like a homemade recipe.  The waitstaff were all low key and nice.  My brother-in-law said he would like to belly up to the bar on  a regular basis.  In Chicago, this meal would have been at least $10 more.  Tucked into the eastern nook of Cleveland near Shaker Square, Felice serves wonderful dinners, a warm atmosphere in an interesting converted home.  Great menu with good prices.  I want to go back in the summer to check out the patio.  Cool house aside the food pleases and was the best I've had eating out in a while."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance at Felice is amazing. I came here after my medical residency graduation for dinner with family. When you enter the restaurant, it felt like you were invited into someone's home for dinner and the patio in the front just added to the ambiance on a perfect Cleveland spring evening. 

We started out with the goat cheese appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. The acidity of the red sauce that surrounded the ball of goat cheese helped cut through the goat cheese. We also ordered the fried calamari, which although was not the best I have ever had, was great. Finally, the baby back ribs were the all star - they were perfectly cooked and the meat just fell off the bone. Although I know that BBQ aficionados may not consider it \"real BBQ,\" it was absolutely perfect. 

Because it was a special occasion, we ordered the bananas foster for dessert. It came with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the bananas were perfectly cooked, incorporated into a creme brulee. It was a wonderful end to a great meal. 

Also, the drinks are SO strong. I ordered an Old Fashioned while my mother ordered a margarita, and we were taken aback at how much alcohol was in it. They definitely don't skimp on alcohol here. 

Felice Urban Cafe is a wonderful establishment and one can tell the preparation that goes into each dish. I would totally visit again."}
{"text":"Not to mirror Samantha's review but I'm also torn between 3 and 4 stars. It's so back and forth that I almost want to go with 3 --- but i really love going there --- so I'm going with four!  I also agree with most points of her review. I've been to Felice three times. Once for a \"date night\" with my boyfriend where we sat at a table outside, and twice for drinks at the bar with him. 

Both experiences at the bar were great. We had the same bartender both times and I totally forget her name (sorry!) but she has lots of tattoos and always is rocking a cool hairstyle. Regardless, she always takes the time to help us pick a wine that we can agree on or steer us a different direction so we will both be happy. She is prompt and attentive without being overbearing. Water glasses are always filled as were our drinks. If we wanted to have conversation she chatted with us and if not, she was not hovering over us. I've had great service and great experiences at the bar. 

Now onto table service --- when we sat outside this summer and had a full dinner/drinks WHOA they missed. Everything took SO SO SO SO SO long. Another unintended 1.5-2 hour dining experience. I honestly forget what appetizers we had -- I recall them both being okay. When my boyfriend's drink was empty for ten minutes -- she asked if he wanted another one and did not acknowledge my empty glass. Brought him a refill (7 mins?) later and the acknowledged my empty wine glass. Another 10 mins to refill that one. It was a little excessive. We both got pasta dishes. Mine was not good.  Not a lot of flavor but I ate it. His was really good. I believe it was the pene and I got spag. Or vice versa. I don't really remember. I mainly remember everything taking forever and not being really worth it. 

Would I go back? Yes!!!! However, I will continue to sit at the bar and probably still just go there for the drinks."}
{"text":"Wow, Felice is amazing.

Before heading to the Motown concert, we stopped at Felice on Larchmere for a happy hour dinner. And boy, was it good.

It's a house. Randomly perched on Larchmere, we suddenly saw a sign that said \"Felice\" with these random artistical...things up in the yard. Off we parked and wandered in.

It's rather cute. There's a bar area in the back barn-ish area, with HEAT LAMPS (awesome) and a full bar. Then, you walk into the house, and bam, there's the restaurant. Very nicely put together, and very nice ambiance. Thumbs way up.

We were seated on the patio (which was lined with lights and there was a lovely heater right next to our feet). While we were seating, the owner came over and asked, \"have I seen you guys before? Have you been here before?\" And then started chatting about Felice's history (owner of Fat Cats also owns it), and how there were Felice's names in her family, and so on. Oh how cool. How many people actually do that? I turned to my foodie partner and stated, \"there's a yelp star going up, just for that.\" The service was great the whole night as well- once we were done with the food, plates were swept up, our waitress was super knowledgeable...yesssss, that's a good restaurant.

We got a couple of drinks starting out. I got the spiced ginger- he got some cocktail. Both were perfect. Usually drinks are a tad strong and you're choking on the alcohol, but nope, the way they make it to Felice was just perfect- not weak, not too strong, but flavorful while providing you with that warm tummy feel.

Then, we chose off the happy hour menu. The dishes were actually surprisingly big (and believe me, we eat a LOT), for the insanely cheap price. We got the whipped avocado and chips (those chips! mmmm kind of an airy pita chip), fried calamari- wow, these were meaty and with the romesco sauce, it was SOOOOOOO tasty, the BBQ ribs were AMAZING. And man, I love my ribs- those ribs, the meat was so tender and just came off the rib....wow, I really liked those ribs. The pizza we ordered was also good- it had manchego and butternut squash...Mmmm. And the surprise of the night? The crispy chickpeas! That's good. With fleur de sal and some type of lemon zest, they were actually quite the tasty crunchy bits of goodness.

We were way too full for dessert- I want to go back and try it.

This will be a definite favorite of mine in Cleveland. You GOTTA check it out. Five stars, way high up."}
{"text":"we came here with a group of friends. this is a fairly popular place I can tell and we were dining at the patio because everywherelse was taken. I ordered roasted chicken thighs. they were pretty ok I would say but the portion size was a little small and it is a bit pricey. my friend complained how small the two tacos were and he had to pay 14 for them or something. the waitresses was also rushing us at the end because she was trying to seat a second group of people. that also left me with a kinda meh impression of this place."}
{"text":"We went to Felice for dinner on a Friday night and the food was pretty good, but the service could use some improvement.

The atmosphere is nice - in a lovely renovated old house with several small dining rooms on the first floor and a bar on the second floor.  It's cozy enough, and it was somewhat busy on a Friday night but not completely full.  

On the food.  We ordered the grilled green beans to start, which were good, but really small; we got about ten beans total.  For entrees, the skirt steak was actually amazing (it came with tasty rice and beans, tomatillo sauce and some shredded carrots that didn't really add anything but were fine), grilled walleye, mac and cheese with chorizo (also amazing) and taquitos.  

For dessert we went up to the bar and had drinks and the molten lava chocolate cake, creme brulee and some sort of apple crisp, all of which were pretty good.  

Their happy hour menu was pretty good, and they have a late night happy hour beginning at 10, so we had \"avocado with house-made tortilla chips\" for a snack, which was pretty much a light guac with some yummy chips for $3.  Not bad!

In general, the service was somewhat friendly, but extremely slow and unapologetic.  I think this restaurant would be much improved if they would just have better service.

I hear their patio is fantastic in the summer, so we'll have to go back to try that.  Overall, the best option for dinner right now on Larchmere."}
{"text":"So happy that reverse happy hour is still in place! 

I've always loved the idea of their happy hour (10-midnight) and was disappointed when I heard it may be ending. We were in the area on a Friday night and stopped in for a drink, to find it's still going strong! Even better! The food is outstanding for the price and the cozy upstairs seating is perfect for a late night date or drink!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come out here for a couple of years. Friday night I finally made the trip. I hope to be coming here on Fridays and Saturdays for the reverse, late night happy hour that runs from 10 pm to 2 am. The food was great. I had the veggie taco, avocado dip with chips and the chicken sandwich. When the bartender set it all in front of me, I didn't think that I would be able to finish it all. I started eating it and realized I wouldn't be able to not finish it. The beers were pretty cheap. I had a silver bullet for $2. I don't like drinking heavy beers and driving far so that explains my poor selection. Dave is a great bartender. Really friendly guy. I remembered him from his days working at Loop in Tremont. The back patio is awesome and I am hoping for some more temperate nights so I can enjoy this place. This would be a good place to bring a date. I have to remember that in case that ever happens again. Fingers crossed. Of course, I would only take her if it is happy hour. Mama didn't raise no punk."}
{"text":"Among my favorite restaurants in the #CLE, Felice never fails. Last year we dined al fresco, alongside Felice's fresh farm-to-table vegetable and spice garden. I had the Vegan Tacos, which were a flavorful feast. Upon our return this fall, we had the Vegan Tasting Plate with homemade hummus and an assortment of colorful pickled vegetables and pita wedges. For an entree, I selected the Linguini Arrabbiata, which had just the right amount of spice -- savory but not overpowering. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came for the vegan menu before it was rolled out. Everything was delicious, I especially loved the almond crusted tofu with quinoa and roasted vegetables and the cilantro coconut basmati rice with pickled zucchini. The fried plantains with mashed black beans and mango sauce was good, but needed more sauce as it was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Great patio, wonderful day for porch fest! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"As a NYC \"foodie\" who is in Cleveland for a day, this place is one of the biggest wins I've had on the road.
The food was superb, extremely fresh, well prepared, beautiful, and creative.  Also, for what I ate, this was DIRT CHEAP!  A $17 duck breast with fresh potato pancakes, homemade grape jam (more like chutney, very savory) and local chevre.  Amazing!!!
Actually, everything we ate was sublime.
As someone who is constantly on the road I love to use yelp to find good places to eat, this has been my biggest win ever.  The food was comparable to some of the best restaurants I've eaten in NYC.  Was this place better than those, no... but it quite close and at a FRACTION of the cost.

Please eat here, I want it to be here when I come back to Cleveland one day.

Also the service was STELLAR."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I dined here on a Friday evening having been a few years back and remembering a good experience.

When we arrived, we were seated and we were not greeted by a server for over 20 minutes, prompting me to tell the manager.  She apologized and said that our first round of drinks was on the house, which was a nice gesture, but given the other mistakes made, it was not enough.

The cheese plate we ordered was very bland.  My girlfriend ordered grilled octopus, which did not come out with the other appetizers.  The server came by and asked if the octopus had been served, and since it had not, she went inside to see why.  She came back with the grilled octopus which seemingly had been made but not served, and it was cold - no effort was made to heat it up or remake the dish.

Overall, the experience left me thinking that the restaurant is very poorly managed and the food is not worth the price paid."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Combo meat/cheese/veggie board was really tasty, but small for $18. They appeared to only have one server for the entire patio. She was friendly but way too busy to ask for refills on drinks and getting our first drinks took 15 minutes. We were told 30 minutes after waiting that they were backed up in the kitchen and it would be a while longer for our appetizer. Appetizer was missing an item which the server said she would go get and ten minutes later we still didn't have, so flagged down our waitress to get it. Ribs and pork chop were good but overall service was very slow."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time this weekend. What a spectacular place! The atmosphere is delightful. This is a well maintained, tastefully decorated, old home nestled near Shaker Square. There's a patio out back, a front porch and three levels of dining area. A side garden provides fresh produce used by the kitchen. The service was fantastic. Our waiter knew all the dishes, and provided vivid descriptions. The pace of the meal was relaxed, and our needs were promptly met. Our dinner selections mirrored the eclectic nature of the menu. Our party ordered a cheese plate, celery soup, mac n cheese, strip steak, salmon burger and a tasty hamburger. The flavors, preparation and presentation of each dish were perfect. The chef put great thought into crafting each plate. The price is reasonable, and the quality outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the food I got was worth the price I paid but for about $45 I had a salad with apples, marcona almonds, dolce gorgonzola, thyme, sherry vinaigrette and then the bavette steak with balsamic braised onions, kohlrabi and yukon gold au gratin, and roasted brussels sprouts. I also ordered a beverage that included some combo of alcohol and loganberry soda which was good. The food was better than most but still not fantastic. The onions were too balsamicy and overpowered the flavors of everything else. My salad was great though. The apples were legit quarters instead of thiny shaven pieces of apple. The food was good and I would probably go back to try some other things but the price really just has me hung up. I meal for a date night would easily blow past the $100 mark and I don't think their food is worth it. I'd have to try some other things to convince me otherwise."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the restaurant which is actually like a 3 story house. It's so rustic cute in here though. I came for a birthday party, the host rented out the very top attic space (good for perhaps 20 people ish). Up there, lots of comfy seating and a few benches to sit and eat, like a lounge. Plenty of room to get up and mingle though. There's a bunch of speakers up there to play music as well. We had one server, God bless her heart, was very attentive in taking orders and serving us promptly. 

The food was scrumptious. In leui of a big sit down dinner we ordered all the appetizers which worked out great (just a little pricey though). My favorite of them all was the grilled octopus (perfectly cooked, wasn't too hard, lightly marinated in orange, lime and chile); the pizza was pretty regular (thin crust, red sauce...wasn't overwhelmed); pork steam buns (each plate has two buns, had pork belly slices in it, was pretty good); kale appetizer plate (loved this! would order it as a side of veggies; marinated in tahini dressings and came with onion, tomato, jalapeño as well). 

No parking lot, find a space on the street or in the neighborhood."}
