{"text":"The food here is okay. It's authentic, but the environment and service makes it not worth it to ever come back. Also, I don't know what kind of oil they use but it made me feel really icky afterwards.   Their English menu is translated incorrectly, so if you wanted the cold vinegar cucumber dish, ask first. Otherwise you might order the cucumber coriander dish and end up with a plate of just onions and green pepper.   Don't expect a clean restaurant either. Only one of their staff speak english and cantonese. The others gave us attitude for wanting to change the plate of onions to cucumbers even though it was THEIR fault for the misunderstanding on the menu.   P.S. They were painting the walls right beside us WHILE we were eating...with a baby.   Never coming back, only reason we went was because it closes at 2 am. Would not recommend to anyone either."}
{"text":"One of the many Chinese restaurants in the Midland/Finch area. Serves up Chinese style BBQ skewers with cumin chili spice rub. Decor is very basic, not cozy nor hipster. Just some long tables with booth chairs for big and small groups.  Menu is completely in Chinese with no English translations. Had the service call menu buttons but service was somewhat minimal. Ordered beef (4), lamb (4),and squid (2) skewers and an order of potato \"cake\". The squid and meat themselves were grilled hot and the thin metal skewers are quite chic. Meat was juicy and not dry. However, the spice rub kind of tastes monotone after a few bites. Everything kind of tastes the same. The potato \"cake\" is just fried sliced potatoes with the same spice. It tasted decent but it doesn't look very appetizing. Came here mainly to have some skewers as a snack so didn't have a chance to try the other main dishes.  Perhaps should offer the choice of ordering per skewer rather than an order of 2-4 skewers. This allows for more variety. Maybe have a different flavoured rub (just salt with lemon juice would taste quite nice) to make it a but different.  Not my typical style of dining, though I'm sure the restaurant caters to those who enjoys flavourful meaty skewers with a glass of beer. Recommend coming with larger groups so can try more things."}
{"text":"I came here w my family last year after a lil trip out of the city. I was dead starving when I checked in, and wanted those chuan'rs ASAP!  I think this is the kinda place you'd wanna get wasted at. Full of drunk foods and unhealthy snacks.  They have a lot of variety of chuan'r. It's basically kebabs, or skewers in general. They serve fish skewers, squid skewers, even cartilage skewers. But of course they also serve the normal meats as well. The meat ones are all over-seasoned to the max. Probably because they don't marinade it. But I was hungry af so I ate it all.  Other than chuan'rs, they serve hot and cold dishes but we didn't really get those, except for one stir fry thing which i barely touched.  I recently just ate here again. Almost the exact same experience as last time, to be honest. This time I got the fish on a stick. It's actually really good.  Overall not a disappointing experience. Reminds me of home... otherwise 3 stars."}
{"text":"My first time here and I liked the food a lot. In used to the flavors and liked the variety of meat. Even the noodle stir fry was pretty good.   Prices aren't low but it's a different type of food so I think it's worth coming once in a while. Definitely won't be a regular spot though. Lots of dessert places in the area to go to after as well."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best lamb skewers around, the seasoning is almost addicting. Basically all of the bbq stuff have the same seasoning, the only difference being that the meat is different. They have other dishes too, but those are at best \"ok.\" This place is good once in awhile, when your cravings kick in, but for me it's too oily to be eaten daily or even weekly."}
{"text":"This is my BF and I's go to BBQ place. We've been going here a while and they've done some renovations. It looks great!  In terms of food, we love their beef and lamb bbq! There's something about the way it's seasoned that we crave for. Food is cheap and great to share with friends over some drinks."}
{"text":"Decent food, kind of no frills with rough and ready but cheerful service and open very late too."}
{"text":"They overuse spices on everything. I mean extremely heavy taste. Poor customer service like they almost throw the food on the table. I will not come back."}
{"text":"Let me say this first: This establishment is named after the northern district of China, where the temperature is always edging towards the cold side. From this region, most food are prepared hot and spicy to counteract the cold weather.  In this sense, the flavor of the food here at Harbin BBQ reflects the Northern Chinese cuisine pretty well. Everything has some sort of spiciness in it, and it is not a taste that anyone can walk in, without prior knowledge of the food in that region, to appreciate.  I went there late night after a small gathering with a group of 8 people. With such a big group, we managed to order quite a big selection of food. And if you know the Chinese cuisine culture, we share everything anyway.  One thing to note, is that each order of \"kebab\" style barbecue meat comes in 4. For example, 3 orders of lamb kebab will give you 12 skewers of meat. The metal skewers themselves are exaggeratedly long (a good 3 feet), but the meat always covers a good foot on the skewer, which makes it very good value.  How do I put this... Everything, as I mentioned before, is (properly) excessively seasoned with herbs and spices. Eating kebabs like this, one cannot really tell the taste of the different kinds of meat; rather, the texture of these meats becomes quite important.  We ordered the regular beef kebab, the famous lamb kebab and the chicken cartilage kebab (Yes, the first reaction is usually \"What the hell is that\"). I am happy to report that the taste of all these skewers are quite excellent. Again - properly spiced up. However the beef kebab is edging towards the rubbery side. Now, that does not mean it is bad; it is advertised as the lean part of the muscles anyway. I just wish, at this time, there is slightly more fat to the meat.  The lamb kebab is what one might expect from the western region of China (Xinjiang). The meat is not rubbery, and has the right amount of fat it in. Quite delicious.  Now, the weird one: The chicken cartilage skewers: This is the part of the chicken that usually no one wants. It is an acquired taste - not everyone will like it. A couple of my group gave us the \"what-the-hell-did-I-just-eat\" faces when they tried. The texture is a little crunchy, yet chewy. It is a delicacy in some parts of China, and they are great for making kebabs. Imagine when you are eating a chicken leg. The tissue between the drum stick and thigh - that's what cartilage feels like. Note that I said \"feels.\" Obviously alone it doesn't have much taste to it. But it is a very interesting texture in this style of kebab.  In addition to the skewers, we also ordered a spicy hotpot of fish. The literal Chinese name of the dish is \"Fish Cooked in Water,\" which totally isn't what it sounds like. Before you even see the hotpot, you WILL smell the spiciness from the soup. The bowl doesn't look hot, as there isn't any steam coming out of the bowl. However that is deceptively false: The only reason you don't see steam is because the whole dish is covered by thick, red spicy oil.  It is a different kind of spiciness, unique to the northern Chinese cuisine. It is not just a form of pain. It is actually tasty. And once you get over the first bite, the spiciness will dissipate over your tongue. You will sweat for this dish, don't get me wrong, but you definitely won't need to run to the washroom and open up the tap water to run your tongue under it.  The fish in the bowl was cooked well. It is not overdone, yet well-cooked enough, giving the fish meat a tender texture. However, comparing this dish to similar dishes at other restaurants, the selection of the parts of the fish is... different. Most other restaurants would use pure fillets; but here you will find a lot of bones attached. So if you don't know how to eat fish with bones, this is not for you.  Arguably, this is how it is supposed to be cooked: with the whole fish in. Maybe I am lazy, I do prefer having just the fillets though.  In addition to the main dishes, we also ordered quite a few appetizers. We had a couple dishes of white cabbage and a plate of mushrooms, also seasoned heavily with the same spices on the skewers. To balance things out, we also ordered a cold-mixed tofu dish and a \"red-oiled\" tofu skins.  The veggie dishes are tasty as the skewers - which may not be what some people expect. Usually in a Chinese establishment, when vegetables are ordered, they are there to \"cleanse\" the palate. Not so much with these dishes. Spicy, spicy, spicy! Which you may or may not like, really.  The \"red-oiled\" tofu skins are surprisingly mild - compared to those skewers, that is. The cold-mixed tofu, on the other hand, is the only blend tasting dish among all we ordered. Which is GREAT. It balances everything out very well, with the taste of sesame oil and chives.  The bill ended up $140-ish (tips not included). We also had 3 beers and some soda. For about $20 a person, this is a steal.  Will definitely come back for late night snacks!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late supper with my hubby and brother. They ordered a pitcher of draft beer for $6.99. Needless to say, it was from an obscure brewery and my brother said it tasted like water. But for the price, not bad. We got a variety if bbq skewers. They were quite good but everything is covered in the same spices, so everything tastes the same. We got lamb, tofu sheet, chicken wings, squid, green chillis, cabbage and yellow croaker fish all done in the bbq style. Everything was moist and not too overdone or charred. We also got a pickled veg and pork belly soup dish too. Tasted ok with a slightly sour taste and had glass noodles and tofu in the dish too.  The food brought out to other tables looked appetizing but were drenched in oil and glistening, really.  Service was crap, waitresses were miserable and we had to order extra beers twice. Also, they don't have a cart for dirty dishes, clean bowls, tea cups etc they just had them in plastic trays on the floor!  Not a bad place for food but I wouldn't be rushing back again. Would come if I wanted to eat late at night because it's open till 2am. The order sheet is also only in Chinese, so if you don't read Chinese, like me, you're stuffed."}
{"text":"When I came, they did not have an English menu in the house. At all. I also could not find an English name for the restaurant, other than Harbin Restaurant. Upon entering, my first thought was that everyone else in the restaurant, other than my family, was from Mainland China and Mandarin speaking. I came because I had just come back from a trip to Harbin, and I wanted to show my family what the food was like.  We ordered Harbin style sausage. Harbin is known for its sausages. What was served to us were wieners that had cumin and pepper seasoning on them. Totally not Harbin sausage. Not cool.  What was totally cool was the cabbage skewers. The cabbage is BBQ-ed, then seasoned with cumin spice. Odd combination, but the sweetness of the cabbage and the earthiness of the cumin go really well together. I now order this every time I go to a Northern Chinese restaurant that has it on the menu.  I recall their fried rice being pretty good, and their lamb skewers being the same. I have not gone back since my first time here (so much to try and so little time!), but my brother, who did not particularly enjoy Northern Chinese food, seems to have enjoyed it quite a bit, to the point that he remembered it and wanted to go back (and so he did). He now also enjoys Northern Chinese food."}
{"text":"Good food, low stars from people that don't know what actual chinese food is."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5, service: 2/5,ambient: 2.5/5  This is the spot I came with my mother all times when I lived in Scarborough. We both don't perfer the Hong Kong- style Chinese food because we are from the south west of mainland, we perfer salty and spicy food instead of sweet. So this place is right up our alley.  This place offers northern style BBQ which ingredients are usually cabbages, sausages, lamb, beef, chicken, stc. Do aware they are always spicy unless you tell them not to put any pepper powder. I absolutely love their BBQ cabbage?, it's the dish I get every single times I visit there. Their BBQ lamb is good too. Also I liked their cauliflower dry pot.   Servers sometime can be rude or show bad attitude. Also they don't speak the perfect English, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Really depends on what you order, Some dishes are pretty good while some others leave you wondering why they even serve them.  I don't know the English names so feel free to Google translate them, I'm sure it will match their English menu as well   Good:  ??? ??? ??? ???  Meh: ????  Bad: ????? ???"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are giving such high stars.  Service IS bad, everyone who works there looks unhappy to serve you.  Everything tastes the same; salty and spicy. It's dirty -  but I've seen worse.   BUT in return you get:  cheap food and drinks; free parking; very bad service and and a happy husband. Whatever makes the husband happy :)"}
{"text":"Meh. All I could remember was the spiciness of the BBQ skewers. Honestly speak, if it wasn't for the chili power the meat would be favourless. The meat wasn't well marinated at all. We had to order those herbal tea because of the spiciness. I liked their lamp skewer and chicken kneecaps for BBQ items, and that fried sweet and sour pork. The cold tofu was pretty good too.  The environment was pretty loud and not really that clean. It was packed at night and you had to yell to talk to each other. There was free wifi but it was slow.   The price was ok, we ordered like over 10 dishes of skewers and some vegetables and total was about $20 per person for a group of 9."}
{"text":"Service now has changed a lot and now servicers are good and friendly. Food was a bit salty but kind of expected. Interesting place to visit and quite a different experience compared to traditional Chinese food. Recommended. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is so packed, and not just because of people. They have fridges and storage all over the place. It's just so uncomfortable and the food is not that great.  Staff: Service was pretty bad. They had given us cups but no water. I had to constantly ask for water or refilled on our jug. When food came, they constantly just piled them all in the same dish, without even telling us what the dish was. It was quite frustrating not knowing what you were about to eat, especially those who had food preferences. The staff would have to be flagged on multiple occasions. None of us spoke Mandarin so I will say that I appreciated their efforts on speaking English to us.  Ambience: They seated us at a table in the back by one of the fridges. The table was dirty. The seating was cramped. They constantly leaned over people to get food out of their fridge. It was pretty bad. The place is also quite loud. I just had a constant feeling of dirty.  Food: The food is okay. The flavouring was the same for all the meats. I did enjoy their dumplings. Not much else can be said.  I'm definitely going to pass on this location next time unless someone I know is dying to go here."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect at the point. Lamb kebab, beef back strap, heart tube all tasty and not that salty as other BBQ do. Fried pork in scoop and clear noodle in sesame sauce are both authentic must try. Dishes and cups are clean, so no need to worry about hygiene stuff. Yellow croakers are big crispy! You should try this! Authentic northeastern China BBQ!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sichuan style Chinese BBQ here... I am from Chengdu and I totally think the food is authentic here. Good spiciness and also flavorful. I ordered Fish BBQ and they served in a big portion. I would say the more people share the dishes the more cost efficient..and you could also try all different BBQs. They have veggie options too if u r a vegetarian like my husband. Would come back again during my next visit in Toronto. The reason I gave 4 stars out of 5 is the service...staff is not that pleasant and they seem in bad mood when we visited."}
{"text":"Atrocious service, subpar food, & intolerable seating; should sum up Harbin BBQ.   Be wary food goers, the English and Chinese menu do not align. You may have ordered cucumbers with parsley, but receive a plate of onions. Do not stumble into this pitfall as I did.   Service cannot process English well, so enjoy your plate of onions.   Food is below the standard of similar cuisines in the surrounding area. AND at a higher price point.  The interiors look and feel like a kidnappers ransom note. Hideous.  1/5 would not order a plate of onions again."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and distasteful compared to other similar restaurants in the area. I can bare both of those but the worst part is their attitude and service. That one tall guy who works there behaves like the whole world shat on his chest and made him hand scoop the shit into his mouth and eat it.   We ordered C9 on the menu which clearly says cucumber but it comes as a dish with 99% onion. When I asked the guy about it, all he did was take the menu, point to C9 and shove it in my face. I don't think he knows what cucumbers are.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Its funny, every time we go to these Chinese late night places its the same crowd you see... bunch of loud, half drunks having a good time scarfing down food and cheap pitchers of draft beer!    Harbin BBQ is no different in the late night capital that is Midland and Finch.  Serving Northern style cuisine such as skewered meats and many spicy hot and cold dishes it seems to be a popular late night spot to grab some beer and grub.  The food here is pretty good.  The skewered dishes had very good flavour but they were all deep fried rather then grilled so a bit different on texture.  The standout for me though was the cumin beef which was outstanding with the cumin, chilies, onions and velvety beef.  I would order that again in a second!  Price point was okay and portions were good.  Service was very abrupt but efficient.  Not bad but might be back if I would like to take advantage of cheap beer and wanted develop the stereotypical \"Asian Flush\":)  3/5."}
{"text":"This place was what I was looking for to bring some friends who really like meat.  FOOD: (3.5/5)  1) Lamb skewers ($4.99) [4 kebabs] **would RECOMMEND** - Tasted slightly of cumin, similar to those served at night market and had a nice smoked char taste  2) Beef skewers ($5.99) [4 skewers] - Tasted pretty good, however had bones, so the quantity of actual meat was not as great as the lamb  3) Cumin lamb ($11.99) - Consisted mainly of lamb slices stirred-fried with Szechuan peppers, and came a bit more oily than I would've liked - If I could choose, I would order the lamb skewers over this dish   4) Chicken and mushroom hotpot ($10.99) **would RECOMMEND** - Came in a mini metal wok, over a lit candle, so the dish was kept hot as we continued eating - There were small pieces of chicken on bones that came with the chinese mushrooms and it was served with glass noodles, which was a nice touch  5) Braised beef brisket in soy sauce (cold) ($9.99) **would RECOMMEND** - Similar to a lot of the appetizers given at Asian restaurants that is served cold - Braised beef came on a dish, and the sauce was served on the side, so you could have it as salty as you'd like - A friend said the texture was similar to roast beef    PRICE: (4/5)  Overall, the price was fairly decent on what you were getting. I felt the beef skewers was the one dish, I would not really order again in terms of quantity and cumin lamb due to the oiliness of the dish. But otherwise, most dishes were fairly priced.     OVERALL: (3.5/5)  It's a good restaurant to go to if you're craving skewers and hot pot food. However, just be aware that some dishes may be different than what you would expect. I would definitely recommend the lamb skewers and the chicken and mushroom hotpot if I were to go again."}
{"text":"I usually order lamb skewers , fried fish, squid, and potAto chips. All are really good. Dont order the lamb shank its very small for what it is, had a better cumin shank else where too.. Saw our neighbors table with crawfish too looks good  Service is bad here but you dont expect anything from Chinese service..  Ambiance is not too good too don't expect anything.  Half a pitcher of beer is $3.50 which is good too."}
{"text":"Not really sure why the previous reviews gave it low stars.  I came here with some friends and we ordered a lot of lamb skewers and pitchers of beer. The skewers are decently sized and pretty cheap at $1.50 each, and a whole pitcher of beer is only $7 which is the cheapest I've ever seen in Toronto. The skewers were pretty flavorful. Also we got a intestines and peppers dish that was pretty good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"First time visiting here, food and  service both are poor. We ordered two order skewers,they came out two plates, we were told one plate is actually for another table after we already finished half of them, the server took away the rest skewers in the plate and brought it to the table beside our table. Definitely not coming back..."}
{"text":"2.5 star  BBQ skewers and beer and opens late? Harbin Bbq might be the one you looking for!  Live fish in hot pot from $19.99. Fish still swimming in the tank.  The Chinese only menu is a little confusing even to Chinese reader like me as I have no clue what's the different preparation means....  But of course we are here for some bbq. We ordered bbq lamb ???($4.50), fish??? ($3.99) and man tou ?? ($2.99), and of course some vegetables Cabbage with pork in chili oil ????? ($8.99).  Everything was a bit off. Not the best bbq I had but definitely not the worst.   I might be back but probably not."}
{"text":"There is a lot of bad reviews here, but I have to admit I am addicted to this place. If busy, serve can be challenging. I had the spicy clams and it was amazing. The bbq steam bums was so tasty with a nice crunch and spicy. The wing was great, just make you order extra spicy. The lamb skewers one on the best. I am looking forward to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Found this place by random and who knew it would be a new favorite.  They've got skewers, dumplings, hot pot and more.  Love the sauce they put on the food and the prices are very reasonable for what you pay for.  I'm so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"THEIR SAUCE IS MADE FROM PEANUT!! which will seriously cause life threatening allergies to many people!! There's no warning on their menu, and the staffs didn't even care! heartless people!! all dishes were cold. worst restaurant ever!!!"}
