{"text":"This buffet isn't too bad.  On a Saturday evening, the restaurant was pack with families and kids all around. We manage to grab banquet seats. The busgirl was quick to grab our plate after each meal and we have no problem going to the buffet and coming back from the buffet from our seats.   Overall, it is a great place for a family's meal.  The price is 18 dollars on Saturday which it isn't too bad considering the vast amount of meats we get to choose from. The quality is not the best but good enough."}
{"text":"I go to buffets maybe once or twice a year and my last experience was at a five star hotel so yeah, I've definitely experienced better. I was hesitating between giving this 2 stars instead of 3 but figured for what this place is worth in terms of selection and price, it's fair.  Dinner is 13.99$ and there's a bit of everything. According to their website, Buffet Vichy offers the widest and most eclectic menu in Montreal. They opened up in 1990 and in all these years, you can tell they haven't changed. Vichy's old logo is still very present on each table with neon pink and green coloring. There's really nothing to brag about in decor, it's a big open space, mix of tables and banquettes, dismally dark carpet to mask the messes. Would be ideal for groups/families.  Much of their food is overly greasy, fried, overcooked or dry- sadly reinforcing the bad reputation buffets get. If you're looking for a simple meal, cheap and filling, you can still find something satisfactory. I stuck with the salad bar options, love the feta cheese and tzatziki sauce. In terms of main dishes, I ate lot of their salmon, shrimps with rice and roasted potatoes. For dessert, I really liked their creme caramel flan and black cherry ice cream.  Don't expect anything fancy and don't come here often, you won't be too disappointed."}
