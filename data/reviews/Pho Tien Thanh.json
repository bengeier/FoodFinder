{"text":"I went there on Sat night around 8pm and i had a small rare beef tendon pho, bf had a large fatty rare beef pho, and we also ordered a shrimp papaya salad. The noodle was cooked just right for now, soup was good too, not too salty, though i still got very thirsty at night, i heard there's no msg but i guess they meant \"less msg\"? i was hungry when i sat down and got full after the small, but again, i almost finished my soup, whereas my bf is wasting away the soup and only eating the noodles. (I think he's missing the whole point of eating pho but whatever makes you happy...) 

Do not order the papaya salad, i would've believed if they tell me it's raddish instead. 

The place is clearly not going for fancy style, it looks like a food court of some sort. 

I would suggest this place to my friends and I would go again if i get a chance, and i might try another kind of pho instead. Maybe a spicy one since i LOVE spicy!"}
{"text":"Best pho in toronto! And them avocado shakes are to die for....i have searched toronto far and wide for a good pho broth and this definitely takes the cake! 
Fast service, looks a bit shady on the outside but dont let that fool you- amazing food!"}
{"text":"Probably the best budget Pho in the city.  They only take cash, the quality of service can kindly said to vary (although always polite), you are often crammed together with other groups on a busy night, and its decor is mildly depressing, but they perform where is really counts, good food.  The varied crowd usually has a good energy for a fun place to grab a bite.

Don't go here if you want an elegant dining experience. Do go here for a place with an interesting character and damn good broth."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say that my first time at Pho Tien Thanh was only 6 short months ago. I guess I've never really had a craving for this Vietnamese staple, and it's probably the result of a string of mediocre experiences. But, now that I've been to Pho Tien Thanh, I can't stop myself from wanting (and dreaming about) that delicious first sip of broth. It's probably the most comforting thing I have ever tasted in my life!

The different combinations of noodle soups seem endless after glancing through their menu, but I'd recommend you go with the rare beef noodle soup (#23 ), and make sure you get the large.

And if you're feeling under the weather, this is the perfect dish to get some life back into you."}
{"text":"The best Pho in the city. Healthy and good price."}
{"text":"Decor - meh

Service - Excellent

Food - Good Pho, most authentic tasting pho.  N not to oily!"}
{"text":"I remember the first time I entered this place. I thought it was your average place to eat, and I still remember that I wasn't even in the mood to dine with my parents.

Boy was I wrong.

Instantly, one of the servers approached us with a selection of what tea we would like. He even read my mind and brought out a glass of water for me. +1

The food definitely tastes better than Golden Turtle, also on the same street as Tien Thanh. The Pho at this restaurant is unbelievably more tastier than what I have eaten in the past. You cannot argue for the fact that the one whole bowl of deliciousness can be found anywhere else. The meat is made the way you like it, the broth is definitely tasty, and the rice noodles will make you ask for more.

The only peeve I find really distracting while I'm eating is the environment of the place itself. It's a really nice restaurant, although they could probably fix the dining area a bit up. But looks won't affect how they create such an awesome piece of food."}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN ALL OF TORONTO! Their beef noodle broth is just stupendous! It doesn't contain as much fat and oil as you would expect from other restaurants which is really good! This is probably the only pho restaurant i would recommend to anybody. Though the atmosphere is not like a 5 star restuarant, the food sure makes up for it. The man who owns it is very friendly as well. It's really GREAT!"}
{"text":"Around the world reviewing pho.

Alright. After some 100+ Vietnamese restaurants. This pho, is the best I've ever had.

The broth has complexity and depth to it that tastes Pho-cking incredible. It also varies from day to day but it's always amazing.

Tips
*get the mango smoothie (especially if the older man owner is making them, his wife makes them chunky, still amazing though"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by quite a few people and finally decided to go! Boy, I wasn't disapppointed at all from this first visit! The broth was good (probably the better broth ive had) and sliced beef wasn't bland. The shrimp springrolls were okay, nothing too outstanding. I ordered their House special but I probably try order #16 next time (supposed to be really good) or only with sliced beef and beef balls."}
{"text":"SUSUR LEE EATS HERE. I take that as a good sign, regardless of what you think of the man. And I know, because we were eating there and he came in. 'Nuff said.

It's our go-to pho/bun place - my dragonboat team comes here after almost every practice during dboat season.

- Food
Pho
Never had nor heard of a bad bowl. As with most places, there's more than one size, so be wary of what makes the most sense for you.

Bun
What I usually get (sometimes with the broth, a pho is too big for my appetite). So damn good - pour on the broth, and I dip with almost every bite into some hoisin. Tasty, tasty goodness. Throw on some herbs (I usually steal some from whoever's eating pho), and I'm in heaven. Get the deep fried spring rolls. You won't be sorry.

Deep fried spring rolls
As previously mentioned, you won't be sorry.

- Service
Like many a fast and easy place, there isn't much. That isn't to say they haven't been super nice and accommodating every time I've gone - in fact, they have. They just don't spend much time waiting on your table is all.

- Ambiance
If you've never been for pho, think casual Chinese restaurant that looks like it should be frequented by legit folk from the community, except because this place is on Ossington and it's legit good, it's rife with hipsters.

*Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it can get so darn crowded, especially with said hipsters, that you wait forevs for a table. Try to avoid peak hours.

- Price
Cheap. Cheap-y cheap cheap cheap. Just do your best to come with cash - no cards, if I recall correctly.

Anecdote: 
I brought my picky Asian parents, my picky brother who's become a food snob after living on two continents, my formerly vegetarian sister who thought she didn't like bun, and everyone's respective significant others (me included, although he's already a big fan).

Everyone was pleasantly full and very happy. I turned my sister into a bun lover. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Best pho you can buy in T.O. Period.

All of the staff speak English, it's clean, and speedy service. And above all it's consistent!!! HOORAY! 

...and yes, it's better than Golden Turtle up the road."}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of pho and when my friend told me this place I knew I had to try it.  I had the rare beef pho with tripe and I thought it was delicious.  The broth was very flavourful but not too salty as I find most pho places to be.  The beef was just enough and very tender.

Service was very friendly but I do find the decor very dated."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho joint in the city! I come here almost weekly. I recommend the pho, but not much else here"}
{"text":"This review (and the five stars) is entirely for the pho.  I have never ordered (nor felt the need to order) anything else:

The broth on the beef pho---any of the beef pho dishes---is absolutely gorgeous.  All of the ingredients are fresh, and the price point is fantastic.  Service is lightning fast and attentive.

Go for this pho, and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place delivers, with a punch! I ordered the house special pho, mostly beef slices of different doneness with rice noodles in clear broth. You'd probably need to head to Vietnam to find more delicious pho. 

Place was packed for lunch on a weekend, which is quite expected. But going by the reviews, it's packed on weekdays too. They accept only cash but nothing is more expensive than $10 IIRC. 

Loved it, and going back again soon."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to compare this place with Golden Turtle as both restaurants are within 2 minutes walking distance of each other. Having to choose between either place I have to pick this place. Why? Simply because the pho just tastes better. Nevermind that the place is a bit sketchier (looks they paid $10 for the tables at some local flea market and cobbled them together), or that the waiters do not speak english.... when you're hungry you usually follow your stomach.

Food: 4
Service: 4
Ambience: 3
Overall: 4 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday for lunch. This place is always busy and this time was no exception. There were three groups ahead of us, but we were seated after about 5 minutes. The pho is solid, especially compared to other places in downtown. The broth is flavorful without tasting heavy. The fried spring roll is always a good prelude to the main attraction.  

The only issue I have is sometimes the broth is not as hot as I would like, so now I just write \"extra hot\" on the ordering sheet. Don't know if that makes a difference though because the broth still was not hot enough. Some people may also be put off by the grungy decor but to me the pink walls and the cheap tables add to the experience and makes the food taste more \"street\". The lack of music is okay when it's busy and everyone's talking in loud voices but in rare instances when it's not busy, it's kind of awkward because you can hear everyone's conversation. 

During this visit, I saw a celebrity chef (whose restaurant sits atop an iconic building in the financial district) walk out with his family. The time before that, I saw another celebrity chef (who is friends with Drake) also dining with his family. This made me feel extra hip."}
{"text":"The best pho in Toronto. Now that I've found this place, I won't go anywhere else.. The broken rice with chicken is also my favourite."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest pho places in Toronto! My friends and I love coming here, the food is consistently delicious. I highly recommend their vegetarian pho which you can ask to have with chicken broth! SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The coconut juice was also very nice. I ordered the bbq pork over broken rice with a fried egg. It was amazing."}
{"text":"I like many of the pho places in Toronto/GTA area but this one really stands out to me.  Great broth, fresh meats, basil leaves and etc.  I always kill that large bowl in no time.  It's so good.  They always give me more than enough fresh leaves to throw in unlike other pho restaurants.  I would like to give another couple of stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place for a long time and finally came! First time have to line up for pho in Toronto! Their soup base is so good that I don't even have to eat it with any sauce! Some of my frd said the soup base is a bit too oily for them but i found it's okay. Love that I'm not thirsty after having the pho! That's a good sign.  Place is a bit too hot, air circulation not so good. Lucky it is not a hot day today. Would come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best pho in downtown!

I've become to a regular where I don't even need to look at the menu anymore, its essentially ordered once the waiter sees me

All you fancy pho connoisseurs that whine about the decor, get over it, its a pho restaurant not a fancy smancy bistro...if the decor bothers you then don't go...its simple

I have NEVER had bad service here, never had a wrong order

Therefore, I can't say anything bad about this place at all

Golden Turtle is alright but it needs to add some...what do you call it? Flavor to their broth!"}
{"text":"Way better than golden turtle and way friendlier. Best place for Pho in the entire city!! I strongly suggest the strawberry shake."}
{"text":"Finally, we're here to experience the top Pho in Toronto! Cash only which could be a problem for some. Prices are very similar to other Pho areas except some stuff like their fruit shake at a remarkable price of $5!!! They got some nice combination of meat with rice or vermicelli noodles.

My friend got their beef noodle soup (famous here).
My bro got their vermicelli with some meats.
My other friend got the duck bamboo vermicelli.
My gf got the vermicelli with spring roll and meat.
I got the minced shrimp with crab vermicelli soup.

Beef Noodle Soup: Soup broth is definitely clear and non MSG, however, the beef is not very tender but tough based on my friends wording.

My Bro didn't think too much of his dish.

My other friend with the duck enjoyed it, but didn't really finish it.

My gf enjoyed her dish, but she usually enjoy eating in general.

My minced shrimp with crab soup vermicelli was good, however, like most other places it taste about the same.

Overall Conclusion: This place is rated very well in the Ossington Strip; however, I feel that it is good, BUT not the best Pho in Toronto."}
{"text":"The pho at Pho Tien Thanh was great! I ordered the rare beef pho and it arrived moments later with all the expected accompaniments (bean sprouts, lime wedges, basil, you know the drill). The startlingly red slivers of beef cooked quickly in the steaming broth. The broth itself was really flavorful, almost sweet -- I didn't even feel the need to add any hot sauce. And even the small size left me with a very full stomach that sloshed all the way home."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover! This is by far the best PHO place in Toronto! I've been coming to this place for many years!"}
{"text":"Got a large rare beef special. Soup wasn't very special and there wasn't a lot of beef for a large size but there is enough noodle to get you full."}
{"text":"I've eaten here regularly over the last few years. Food is decent, but service has really gone downhill. It's at the point where I won't come back because it is so frustrating. The waitstaff doesn't care how long you are waiting to place your order and/or get your food.  Also, one time I was here, there were beggars outside asking for change. Ten minutes later, one of them came in and was hitting up diners at their tables for money. The staff here couldn't care less about the harassment and still remained indifferent to customers who were actually trying to order food."}
{"text":"I came to this after eating some terrible lobster poutine across the street...

My co-worker pointed out this place as a good pho place he eats at often and I am something of a Pho lover.

It looks like a dive, but some of the best food can come from such places. I ordered a large bowl of rare beef brisket (what I usually order all the time) and my friend ordered some spring rolls. THE SPRING ROLLS ARE TO DIE FOR. They are fried with shredded pork and I actually went back on another day after I went with my co-workers to order a Jack Fruit Shake (a drink I always order when eating pho). The pho isn't bad the soup is well made and that I feel personally is key in good pho since that's where all your flavor is.

Oh also I forgot I ordered a pork chop and rice combo since I usually test the pho and the pork chop. It wasn't bad but it didn't stand out.

Aside from that it's a pretty good place to go to if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I LOVE pho and I know good pho. I've eaten it my whole life and even traveled to vietnam. Sadly this place falls short. The pho tasted very plain and lacked seasoning; watery almost. I tried adding in the hoisin sauce and hot sauce to help save this place a star but even with that it lacked. Maybe because of the area that it is in where people havent had amazing pho so they always rate it so high. Ive had better pho, bun (vermeceli), spring rolls, rice paper rolls elsewhere in toronto and it is 6 times better. I won't name specifics but Thornhill and north york have many great pho places hopefully you'll land there. 

2 stars not 1 for excellent and friendly service. I wish I could have rated this place higher.

p.s. this place needs a reno, it is a bit worn down in comparsion and overpriced. $7 for a small bowl of pho that tasted plain and bland unacceptable. I aint cheap ill pay $10 if its worth it."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful, fast service, and DELICIOUS! Truly some of the best pho I've had in Toronto and consistent every time. I always order small rare beef pho and deep fried spring rolls. My friend had the vegetarian pho and loved it. Very filling and I leave a flat $20 that includes tax and good tip. Gets very busy during dinner time!"}
{"text":"I have traveled throughout Vietnam and this place is the only place that takes me back there. The best Pho in town for the prices. Yummy Yummy Yummy."}
{"text":"A decent Vietnamese Pho place, always busy with customers, the service is fast and efficient :-) the Pho is so so , nothing significant , Pho , is all about the broth the fish sauce and shrimp paste and the condiments such as the greens and bean sprouts , and since the later mostly is non organic, therefore , reduces the exquisite taste of the Pho significantly. The beef Pho with various cuts of meat was just too water based tasting , although a lot of other sauces were added ."}
{"text":"This is favourite pho shop in the city. I go here about once a week during the wintertime, and it's one of the only reasons I ever carry cash. Generous portions, reasonable prices, and super quick service. The only reason I never thought to write a review sooner is because the place is always packed."}
{"text":"Warning: This place is not good for groups.
The service seems to crumble like 3-day-old cow patties when you foist 14 rowdy diners  on them all at once.  

The pho broth was A-OK for me but heavy on the MSG as evidenced by my massive dehydration the next morning. I really should come back here and have a moment alone with the bowl for a better assessment.

Thus concludes Phobruary. 

Total: 5 
(That's five reviews of pho places where I ate pho in the month of February.)
I think that means I came in 2nd place. Yippee!"}
{"text":"Authentic experience

- The soup had incredible depth.
- Rare beef was incredibly tender."}
{"text":"Was craving some Pho cuz there's none in my neighbourhood. 

Totally picked the right place. The broth was amazing, the beef was tender. 

This is the best pho I've had in at least 10 years. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fantastic pho. Way better than Golden Turtle up the street and probably the best I have had while living in Toronto thus far.

Deep Fried Spring Rolls with Beef and Meatball pho is the best combination there is."}
{"text":"I know most people come for the pho, but I had the chicken noodle soup (had a cold and that's what I was craving) and it was excellent--came with a mountain of sprouts and fresh herbs. I found the servers friendly enough. I usually go to the Golden Turtle and came here for a change. If only this place had proper spring rolls, I'd always come here instead (the spring rolls are thin, greasy and have almost nothing inside them). My boyfriend's pho was also excellent."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big deal is about this place. i ordered seafood pho and was underwhelmed by super MSG broth, 2 smallish shrimp, 2 frozen calamari rings, fake crab meat, and a couple of packaged fried fish balls (plus rice noodles, bean sprouts, etc).  Today I'm exhausted and achy, god only knows what was in the food (MSG, sulphites, gluten?). wish i'd ordered the chicken pho, and without broth."}
{"text":"For what it is, a little Vietnamese joint, it's easily a 4 star.  Don't be afraid to venture away from pho.  Satay soups are great.  Try herb-wrapped beef rolls (#117) for a delicious and healthy option to spring rolls.   Also good is the ice coffee and numerous fruit shakes (coconut, mango and lime).  Service is prompt and efficient.  Like most Viet places it is cash only but at least they've now installed an ATM."}
{"text":"At first, this place might look a little sketchy. Skeptically though, I sat down and ordered a rare beef pho. It was delicious and so flavourful! I can't believe I finished an entire bowl (though I did get the small). Just FYI, the large bowls are HUGE. 
Our server was so incredibly smiley and friendly. He instantly started when we sat down by saying, \"Hi. How are you? I'll go get some tea for my friends.\" I couldn't help but smile every time he came over because he was genuinely such a nice person. 

I will definitely be coming back here. 

Also, cash only."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Saturday morning around 10AM-no wait. I ordered the fried pork skin spring roll and beef and tendon noodle soup. The pork wasn't fried. The noodle was dry noodle from a package. If you are looking for the kind of rice noodle they use at most restaurants. This is not the place to eat. Maybe because I'm from California so I'm spoiled with delicious noodle soup. Additionally, the broth was okay. I wouldn't come back here. I'd try a different place."}
{"text":"Best pho and spring rolls in town! Aromatic broth, sometimes I wonder why they seem to be in a lower class than ramen because I can see and Taste that a lot has gone through here. 

I like this best compared to Golden Turtle and Pho Linh."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!

The food is grreat quality with an excellent variety of soups and aps!  I am actually going there for dinner tonight :)

If you are in the Bellwoods area near Ossington, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Solid pho. Felt so good on a cold day."}
{"text":"I've been fulfilling all my Ossington pho needs at The Other Pho place for a while now, because I know what to expect there.

No more! One visit and I'm a Pho Tien Thanh convert. The service was great - a lovely young fellow greeted me at the door and helped me to a comfortable table away from the door. For the rest of my visit he was attentive, friendly AND understood the steps of service (which are not limited, as many pho places think, to 'take order' and 'drop off food'). 

And the pho was excellent. My little plate of pho accessories came with all the usuals plus a hot red chili and a delicious leaf I wasn't familiar with. The broth was flavourful and full bodied and the 'rare' beef was actually red when it was served. Amazing.

Decor was meh, but I expect that from pho joints. At least there was no television drone or crappy radio station playing. 

And, as all that love isn't enough, my small pho was actually cheaper than The Other Pho place. Pho heaven."}
{"text":"only pho I ever had in Toronto but easily one of the worst pho I ever had. bland broth, small portions, and the beef is just balled up and tossed into your bowl. the inner slices of beef in the ball will not be cooked at all unless you unravel the ball. almost forgot, I've never been to a pho place that makes you order by actually write what you want on the order slip too.

if you must go, maybe try asking for the beef on the side and cooking it by dipping it into the broth. you'll avoid seeing that sad ball."}
{"text":"This is a great place for pho lovers who are looking for options beyond the infamous beef soup. I got a bamboo and duck soup and it was delish. The soup tastes rich and well seasoned, pretty sure it was a chicken based soup. Toppings include duck meat, duck blood sausage and bamboo slices. A dipping sauce is also included. I devoured my bowl and drank the soup to the last drop. I will commute five hours from Ottawa just to have this again."}
{"text":"We tried each category of food here. Grill meat and shrimps are all too dry. Feels like I'm chewing cardboard. The Pho soup is bland. The vermicelli is bland too. What the hell am I eating? It's puzzling why there is usually a long line outside."}
{"text":"So after golden turtle at around 8-9pm they didn't serve soup which is the reason why I went there to eat we headed to pho tien and I may say their rice plater with all meats and chicken without the egg was pretty good, only thing I was disappointed in was the rice but then again im sure I cod have had worse. Next trip here I got the rare beef soup with deep fried spring rolls and the soup was a lot better than golden turtle but wasn't expecting such a small portion of the spring rolls. But not totally knocking their spring rolls as they were extremely better than GT.

Overall, hands down my favorite pho spots in down town Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm not a pho connoisseur but the pho tasted flavorful enough without relying on msg. What I did appreciate, though, was the cold tea they served for free. It was a hot day in September and not only did they serve cold tea, it had taste instead of the usual bland water they called tea. I was not tempted at all to order any drink and wanted to refill my pot instead. It's the small details that really define a good restaurant with a bad one."}
{"text":"Do not come to this place. I don't even know how this place got so popular. 

First, we weren't even greeted when we entered. The waiter looked at us and walked away. We had to sit ourselves at a table. 

We were then handed the menu. After getting our food, we weren't impressed even a tiny bit. No different from any other pho place in Toronto. To this point, we weren't served tea at all. We tried to get the waiter attention. \"WHAT... WHAT\". That was all we got. He yelled across the room, didn't bother coming to us and talk like a human being. 

We requested for our tea and a can of coke. It took 5 min to get our tea. We ordered the coke again. Another \"WHAT\" with frowning eyebrows. What the heck is with this guy attitude. He turned away and walked to his friend's table. Again, another 5 minutes to get our coke. \"Here you go boss\". That was what said. 
\"Thank you\", we said.
\"Yeah...\", he answered.

What a terrible experience. First time We came as per our friend's recommendations, also the last time.

Do not come here if you don't want to spend money and get hostility in return."}
{"text":"Arrived as 2 people and was promptly seated. 2 other groups came in and were seated. They were brought tea and menus. Still waiting for our tea, thought they were a little busy so didn't ask. After another group is seated and brought drinks I asked for some tea. Still waited about 5-10 mins for this. The pho was good, a little salty but still decent in comparison to other places. Although service was bad - I would come back. But once I got home I felt really sick. I think it was good poisoning or something because that's all I ate and I was vomiting and had to use the washroom numerous times throughout the night"}
{"text":"Very affordable but cash only! Love the broth here and they give you Vietnamese coriander as well as the usual bean sprouts, basil and thai chillis on the side. Food is always fresh and the servers are always friendly. A very good family run place."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of pho places and this is my favorite in all the land. The broth is the best.  Normally I don't love broth and hardly have much of it when eating pho.  At Tien Thanh I finish it.  I can't stop spooning it up even after I'm full, it's just so good. The meat is tender and they give sawtooth herb and bird's eye chilis, which I love and not all places do.  I never put sauces, just a bit of fresh lime.  The broth doesn't need it. 

I also always get the fried spring rolls and they are super tasty and the sauce that comes with them is very flavorful. They are a little on the small side, but really good.

I've also seen Susur Lee eating here at the same time as me.  Never had a problem with service; they have always prompt and efficient.

I'm also going to add my comments about the rival Golden Turtle here.  I have to question the palate of those who like it better than Tien Thanh, because Golden Turtle pho was less than average for me.  The broth was bland and the meat in it was tough.  They also don't have sawtooth herb and I had to request the bird's eye chilis.  I've read reviews claiming that the fried spring rolls at Golden Turtle are amazing.  They are amazingly oily and bland.  I hated them.  All I could taste was old oil.  The sauce was also very bland.  They were bigger than the ones at Tien Thanh...for me this was a negative, since I thought they were really bad and almost inedible.  On the plus side for Golden Turtle: their interior is nicer, they have a patio, and the water jugs and glasses they served us were very clean and looked brand new.  Had no problem with service."}
{"text":"Long time customer, always stop in when I'm back in the neighbourhood, or just need that old familiar treatment. 

If you want my order:  fried spring rolls with #69 or #79 depending on whether I'm in the mood for noodles or rice.  Excellent pho broth as well."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it is amazing. I am convinced that the last meal I got here (bbq chicken with vermicelli & spring roll) was the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I may have just been really, really hungry. But still!"}
{"text":"This place definitely nails it in term of pho dish, in fact, I think the broth is more flavourful than my favour Pho Linh.  However, I really wish they use fresh vermicelli like Pho Linh, but I guess dry vermicelli is more widely accepted here.  Their pho definitely beats their neighbour Golden Turtle.  Other than pho, there isn't much to mention here as I have tried their some of appetizers such as spring roll which I wouldn't recommend.  Unlike Golden turtle which has other decent dish other than pho such as bun bo Hue, spring roll and pho sate.  Overall it's a very good place for a bowl of authentic pho and I will definitely pay frequent visit when I crave for pho."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite place for \"Pho\" in city of Toronto. Believe it or not, it is really hard to find another better Pho place compare to this place. The only problem I can't give them out 5/5 is the \"Cash Only\" and the price on their drink list. I know this is nothing to do with the taste of their food but still bother me every time I visit this Pho place."}
{"text":"Used to love this place... It was my favourite pho place...  But then the portion started to get smaller and the quality also seems to be dropping...  It's kinda upsetting...  Fix it soon before I give up on you....."}
{"text":"So everybody (presumably) knows the tale of the Two Phos. Once business parters, the Owners of Tien Thanh and Rua Vang Turtle up the street have since become bitter rivals.  Everyone has their favorite and each is unique in their own right. 

This morning, we went pho hunting but Golden Turtle had decided to close for the holidays. Not wanting to leave 'hood having just paid for parking, we ventured south towards Tien Thanh.

The first time I came to Tien Thanh there was no vegetarian menu and I had them serve me a Bun without meat on top. Since then (I assume the reputation GT has received for the popular vegan pho has had something to do with it) , TT has adopted a vegetarian menu with half a dozen or so options. 

Reading the other reviews, I think that either Tien Thanh has changed the recipe or I chose to try the Vegetarian pho on an extra good day.  Cause it was good. Flavourful and clean and lemongrassy. Lots of tofu, lots of noodles, crisp broccoli. Yes, the boring slivers of carrot but at least a tonne of noodles. The large was perfect sized, and priced at $7.50. 

Zero ambiance, mediocre service but handmade springrolls, cheap enough price and it comes quickly enough.

Just to add fuel to my domestic pho-loving fire, the SO prefers Golden Turtle by a large margin. Gah."}
{"text":"What makes this pho spot stand out amongst all others (most notably, against Golden Turtle) is the quality and cut of the meat. Delicious, thick pieces of beef. Compared to Golden Turtle, this place is homier and more authentic, and a lot more Vietnamese people eat here. I think the staff is also friendlier and the menu is a bit wider. Very good soup-noodle-meat ratio. The broth is fine. My only complaint is that the noodles can come out slightly overdone."}
{"text":"Best pho in Toronto, came here for dinner twice a week."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this spot, when I first walked in I wanted to run back out because the interior looks so outdated and it is kind of gloomy and dusty inside... aside from that it's a place with good food! 

They are really busy, hopefully they use some of their profits to tidy up the cluttered and outdated place, because it's a spot I'd only go bymyself or with a friend but not some place I'd want to woo someone with or for a date Only because of the interior decor."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once when Golden Turtle was closed randomly. The pho is good - I will say that. The spring rolls are so-so. The only thing is that Golden Turtle is better. A good alternative to grabbing pho if Golden Turtle is closed."}
{"text":"**I need to update my review on PTT. My last review absolutely did not do this place justice as I have grown to love it.

The food is SO good and cheap. The spring rolls are enough, alone, to keep coming back.  From the quirky light pink walls, to the incredibly odd selection of art (Bruce Lee, anyone??), this busy neighborhood staple is a must visit for those who love Viet food.

Above all, this place is run by people that you want to support.  Unlike Golden Turtle (up the street) who literally kick-out their own diners when people are waiting at the door (see my review on Golden Turtle), the owner of Pho Tien Thanh is the complete opposite, occasionally welcoming in and feeding the neighborhood poor off the street... so incredibly kind.

I will continue to support this place because the food is great, the prices are cheap, and the owners are good.

Try it out, for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Everyone had something along the lines of vermicelli + spring roll + bbq meat. No pho' at this table. Throw some Sriracha sauce on that bitch and we were rip roarin' ready to go. Beer was $3.25 and sort of warm. The restaurant was really hot even with the AC on. The urinals had ice in them, and I played that game where you try to melt as many cubes as you can. It was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on their word. The place was packed and when we walked in they offered to seat our group of 4 separately which kind of annoyed me. Anyways we said we were willing to wait for a full table. We finally get our table and seats and we get the menus right away. I ordered the BBQ shrimp with rice. I got 3 large prawns that were burnt on the shell, but I thought hey it's the inside that counts! They overcooked the shrimp because it was hard to chew and tough and I ended up not eating them because of that. I had to ask the waiter 3 times for water within the span of 10 minutes because he kept forgetting to bring it. My friend got the BBQ chicken so i tried some of his and it was better then my shrimp. I know people come here for the Pho but like I said I came here with friends, hence me ordering the shrimp. I could have made better shrimp myself at home. Make sure to bring cash when you come as they don't accept debit or credit!"}
{"text":"The pho was really tasty and good. Taste healthy and no msg. It taste like a home made pho my dad use to make. It's a pleasant reminder of my roots! The place can use some clean up, but whatever food is good and price is good. Sounds reasonable to me!"}
{"text":"The best pho I've had in the GTA (of the dozen I've been to at least). Quality broth,  but a bit light on beef."}
{"text":"Favourite pho place in Toronto. The pho is always delicious. I keep coming back and everyone I've brought loves it too."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden jem. It's a small hole in the wall type restaurant that you may miss but it's def a must try. 
I'm not sure what authentic pho is like but I assume this is about as close as you will get to it here in the GTA.
The restaurant is a bit of a dump and at first glance you may think it can't serve anything good, but you couldn't be more wrong! 
The food here is spectacular and fresh and it's almost like taking a trip to another country with out having to go very far. I really enjoy the food here and highly recommend you give it a try but make sure you do a little research on what your ordering unless your up to being adventurous!"}
{"text":"Dirty, rude staff, waiter had fingers in bowl.  Asked if they took American dollars prior to sitting down, they said yes.  When it came time to pay they arbitrarily charged a $5 \"conversion fee.\" But not before trying to charge us the full amount of $27 CAD in USD... shady ****.   Restrooms are very dirty and smell of urine.   Do not know how this place passed health inspections."}
{"text":"The reviews are really misleading. It might just be that the quality nad the service has changed over time. First off when we entered they told us to sit wherever we wish and then after we got our jackets pff and sat down another person asked us to move to another table. The pho was lower than average and the salad rolls were watery as if they hadn't let the water get off of vegies before they roll them. I think most other random pho places I've been to are way better in terms of food and taste."}
{"text":"Great authentic pho place on the ossington strip. Don't let the aesthetics fool you. Their pho broth is super tasty and piping hot! Their bun bo hue was not bad but not the best that I've had in the area. I'd stick with their pho or bun (vermicelli)."}
{"text":"Haha, I read some reviews about this place being authentic and it makes me laugh. I've had Pho multiple times while in Vietnam and this place is far far from it. I've tried it twice, both times wrenchingly salty (My friend actually got sick during the meal and didn't finish) The wait staff are nice, but otherwise this place has nothing going for it. I'd say go down the street to The Golden Turtle."}
{"text":"I have tasted pho in at least five other locations in Toronto before and I have to say this place is hands down the best to me. I grew up eating pho from a different restaurant, but the quality has gone down there.

Food & Presentation: I order only one thing from there and that is the small Pho Dac Biet. The broth has that signature aromatic fragrance. I never thought the rare beef to be off putting, but what you should do when your bowl is served to you is to take those chopsticks and sink them into the hot broth. I dip the meat in a mix of  Hoisin and Sriracha sauce. The rice noodles are the right balance of soft and hard, smooth and the width is how I like it.

Atmosphere & Service: When you walk in, you are either seated immediately or you will have to wait in line. This place usually piles up fast, so the people who wait patiently in line really understand that the pho is worth it in the end. The interior and furniture are not modern, but it has the feeling of eating at a local place in Vietnam. To order, you write on an order slip or you can speak to the waiter. 

Pricing: The small pho dac biet is $7 + tax. No complaints on pricing.

WARNING: They only take cash."}
{"text":"Excellent broth for their pho, as well as generous portions without \"generous\" meaning more noodles - there is plenty of meat to go with your pho regardless of size.

Also the coconut milkeshake is the best thing ever. Just be careful alternating between that sweet/cold icey drink and your hot pho. Gave my partner a headache.

Also the spring rolls are less greasy than other Vietnamese restaurants and smaller - they just look like they've been made with more care with less of an intention to give you a coronary. 

The only reason I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their fluorescent basement lighting type feel. Just a tiny little effort into giving the restaurant a face lift would probably attract more customers. Though I have to say some of the BEST cheap food in Toronto is in small hole in the wall establishments that are family owned. Go for the soul food with good company. Not for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Not the best looking Décor, but really good Pho.
Soup is always hot."}
{"text":"Toronto says this the best PHO 
You need to get on your bikes and ride to Mississauga .
I ordered a large pho with beef and beef balls
Lots of good broth not little beef and only 4 balls  also not enough noodles .
It was like a diet pho .
Place is some what clean .
But not clean enough for your mother so don't bring her .
Staff looks like they have worked a 48  hr shift
It's that kind of mood .
It is not a must try ."}
{"text":"THEY ROUND UP YOUR BILL TO RIP YOU OFF. 

Went in on December 26, 2017 (Boxing Day) when it was super cold and Golden Turtle was closed. First time trying this place. It was packed, so opted for take out of the vegetarian pho.
The woman wouldn't let me order a small. Ok fine. So I order a medium, which is $9 before tax. She asks me for $11. WITH TAX IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY $10.17. I don't appreciate being ripped off like that. I always tip and would have left one if she had been honest with me. It's not a lot of money but it's the principle. So rude."}
{"text":"People rave about Golden Turtle, but I'm a Pho Tien Thanh girl after trying both.
The service is great and so friendly, and the pho is perfect. 
I usually get #13, rare beef and tendon pho, and Tien Thanh nails it.
They give a generous portion of tendon and beef (much more than I got at Golden Turtle) and they have that broth that makes you want to keep drinking more even though you are, indeed, very full.

I just came back from my third visit in a row and caught celebrity chef Susur Lee and his family dining there. I didn't believe it when I read the reviews and interviews but I've seen him there in person with photo evidence to boot!

If you want cheap, quality pho, with great service in Toronto this is your place!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 5/10
Food: 6.5/10
Atmosphere: 2/10
Service: 4/10

If you're on the Ossington strip, I would highly recommend choosing Golden Turtle over Pho Tien Thanh. 

It far exceeds PTT on all fronts: the food is better (and there's more of it), the environment/atmosphere is nicer (something small like when they wipe down the tables, there were still grease streaks leftover from the previous patrons), the service is better (there is one poor dude running around PTT trying to serve everybody which made it slow even for necessities like needing spoons for pho). 

THE BOTTOM LINE: in the battle between the 2 Ossington pho places, this one's lost. I would rather wait for Golden Turtle than eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for pho in the city. The broth is just simply amazing, and the deep fried spring rolls are always a must have appetizer. Sometimes the wait can be a bit longer when they get busy, but I much prefer the service at Tien Thanh than Golden Turtle."}
{"text":"Price rather decent, customer service could use some improvement, and quality of food very decent.

I've been going to this venue for many years now, and the staff has changed a fair amount as of late. With it, there seem to be things that has been asked for that are forgotten, menu items on their fancy new menus being incorrect (the menu will say that an item is a soup, and it turns out when they bring it that it's not), staff will think people in your group did not pay after they've left when in fact they did pay (ended up getting re-embursed after paying for my friends who had already left).

Since they redesigned their menus, the place seems more clean (one of my friends used to have specs in his soup that he suspected were fruit flies, and we haven't seen this type of thing since). 

All-in-all, I love how they have the most reasonably priced appetiser soup, especially for its size. So with that in mind, I will probably return to Pho Tien Thanh, just probably won't be for a while, as I'm a tad upset how I was treated last time (correction on my order seemed to have been forgotten, after I found out that what their menu said didn't match the actual item offered, so I had to wait over 30 mins to get my order, while watching people who got to the venue after I was promised a replacement for what I thought I had ordered)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always a sure thing. Not the most glamorous, but the food is consistently delicious and the wait's never more than 10mins. The avocado milkshake is to die for."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good, pho is tasty; rice dishes good; egg rolls can be better.  The problem we had was that the neighborhood is a little scary---We decided to take the food to go."}
{"text":"Golden Turtle was closed on Tuesday so I came here instead.
I got adventurous and tried #33 as my friend recommended. It was listed under \"misc\" (or something like that). The dish comes with pig's blood and foot, as well as some beef. The server was wise enough to warn me ahead of time so there were no surprises.
I liked the food, though the size of the spring roll was underwhelming. Both the exterior & interior could use a renovation. But the servers are very friendly, and best of all, responsive. I am glad I made a visit. Definitely coming back for pho."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry Susur, please forgive me.

I heard that this is one of your favourite spots for pho, but it really didn't impress me.  

This just isn't the best pho in the city.

Maybe a few beers at Dakota would change my mind.
Perhaps a tequila flight or two from Reposado would make me more star generous...
But even drunk and starving, I don't think I would change my mind.
It's a perfectly average bowl of pho.

We wandered in here on a rainy day for a steamy hot bowl of broth.
The place was busy for a mid-week gloomy evening.

Pho places on the Ossington strip look a lot like grimy run-down pho places in Chinatown. The floor was seriously filthy, they had the standard plastic utensils, and decor was basic and lacked any kind of effort.  

Looked promising.

We started with the spring rolls.
Super small.
Not much to them, really.  
Tasty... now bring me 3 more of them.

The pho wasn't bad at all, don't get me wrong.  
The broth was a bit light and thin...but tasted good with a hint of cinnamon and sweetness.  
Definitely not enough meat.
I just wasn't satisfied.

I'll give this place another shot.  But, I may make a trip to Golden Turtle first."}
{"text":"I was taken to this restaurant a few years ago and I was really skeptical. Once I tried it, there is no way back. Hands down the best pho in Toronto ! The soup is wonderful for winter or anytime you miss Vietnamese food. I also secretly don't tell too many people about this place because I don't want it to be too crowded, but yes if you ask me seriously, it is the best here."}
{"text":"I love pho.  Enough to exclaim pho puns every time I pass by a pho joint:
\"WondaPHO!\", I'd exclaim.
\"PHOnomenal!\", I've shouted.
\"I can eat this PHOever!\" 
\"Please stop.\" the hubs would plead. 
Not everybody appreciaties pho-uns (pho +puns).  Bah.  

Pho Tien Thanh has been so consistently listed in the Top 10 Pho in Toronto in the webosphere that it may have been overhyped in my mind, thus leaving a mild sense of disappointment when pho angels didn't appear (check out the new anime Shokugeki no S?ma and you'll see what I mean).  It's still good though, pho sure.

The broth is clear, but not water-type of clear.  To be more specific, it's more of a light, golden type of transparency that's quite lovely, free of any floating oily layers or broth scum by improper care.  I do wish that they'd add more spices to the mix though, as I can't taste the star anise or cloves that fills you with an inner warmth.  On the plus side, it also doesn't taste super MSG'd, which the hubs complains often gives him nightmares.

The customary plate of fresh bean sprouts and basil leaves is pretty large, and they don't skimp on the basil as they provide a good 3-4 stalks of it for you.  Nice.
 
The cooked, lightly fat beef should really read \"super light, barely fat\" beef.  Like, this beef has been lifting, bro.  Cause it's got barely any fat on it at all.  It's alright though, since it's still tender and doesn't have what I refer to as that\"stinky beef\"/gamey taste that you can get from cheaper cuts.  

All in all, at about $8 for a small bowl, I'd come back again for another casual meal that's easy on the wallet.  Pho sheezy."}
{"text":"Great food! The inside of the restaurant is a bit tacky, but the food is so worth the trip out. There are multiple size selections on most meals and the pho side includes fresh cilantro, basil, lime, chilli pepper and bean sprouts. The cilantro really brings the meal to life."}
{"text":"Really good! We went around 2:30pm on Saturday and there was a bit of a wait, but it only took about 15 minutes. I had the fried spring rolls, rare beef pho, and young coconut milkshake. The spring rolls were amazing and the sauce was good too. I loved my pho! A lot of places skimp on the meat, but not here. There was meat until my last bite! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Having not been to Pho Tien Thanh for quite some time, I ventured out to Queen and Ossington over the weekend to give it another try. I had the stir fry beef with lemongrass on rice, and it was only OK if I'm honest. The beef was quite dry and there was no sauce whatsoever - just beef, lemongrass and some green onion. Overall, a bit bland and tasteless. The rice wasn't great either, clumpy and a bit on the dry side.

My friend had the beef pho and remarked at how fresh the ingredients were. Having said that, we both agreed that we prefer Pho Hung, even if the service is worse.

Neither of us left the restaurant gasping for water, which is always a good sign. A solid three stars for sure, but there are definitely better Vietnamese restaurants around."}
{"text":"There is an air of authenticity to this place that the newer pho places can't manage to replicate.  From the décor and the menu and service, you can tell you are in a real pho place run by folks who know what they're doing.

Following the tradition of pho menus, I had the #9, which is the 'everything' bowl, with tendon, rare beef, and other stuff, just the way I like it.  Having tried my fair share of pho places in Toronto, I tend to compare the relative strengths of each place compared with it.

Here, Pho Tienh's strengths are in the portions and cut of the meat, as well as the veggies. The rare beef and tendon come in bigger and thicker slices, and have a heartier taste to them; no worries about going away hungry here.  The veggie plate also includes the greens that the less authentic places skip, in addition to the usual bean sprout, lime, basil and chilli.  

Soup, noodles, and everything else is as fresh and well done as could be asked for.  There's a non-stop rush of customers from all walks of life, even on a weekday, which makes Pho Tienh have a cozy and welcoming feel.  This is definitely one of the better pho places I've been to, and will make my regular rotation."}
{"text":"My family and relatives had finished our visit to Ripley's Aquarium and wanted a good place to eat.  We frequently get our Pho places to eat from the recommendation of Yelp.   

The restaurant looked alright from the inside and we were seated at the back.   There were four of us seated and we had started to enter our orders from the menu.   I told my wife that I had to go to the washroom wait for the other three people to arrive since they were parking their car.

After I came back from the washroom the other three people had arrived and sat down.   I didn't see our original order paper and was presented with a new one.  I assumed the person working there were going to bring our orders up and we had to make orders for the others who just sat down.

It was strange that the orders for the three people who arrived at the restaurant last came out first.   I politely asked where are our orders for the four people?  The person working there was extremely rude and said we already ordered.  I'm thinking to myself why would there be three orders when there are seven people sitting at the table?   That doesn't make sense.  Why would this person not ask if we are missing anything?  Instead he said \"Why are you blaming me\" and gave me a mean look and clearly pissed and wanted to fight me?  Of course it is his fault, he is the order taker who serves the customer.   

The workers in this restaurant did not smile or acknowledge anything we said.  They are rude and very defensive and did not make the customer feel at ease or happy, instead they've irritated and made me angry.  If my relatives were not with us, we would have left the restaurant. 

Anyway, it was good that the food was as expected and I would say that it is a 3 star at most.  But, they've spoiled my wife's appetite and she didn't eat much of her food.  The customer service skills need to improve immensely at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, Pho Tien Thanh has a hole-in-a-wall appearance with frenetic service and questionable sanitation. All these elements are usually a recipe for a good pho experience and this holds true here.

I ordered their Special Pho and found the broth to be clean tasting and flavorful without being overly oily. The noodles had a nice consistency without being too chewy. The meat was of good quality and I particularly liked the brisket. The portions were also pretty good. I do wish there was more rare beef and also more raw onions.

The fried spring rolls were nice and crispy, however a bit on the small side. Overall, solid pho, but i'm still not sure if I can call it \"the best in Toronto\" since i've had more flavorful broth elsewhere. However, it's a good sign that it wasn't overly salty and I wasn't too thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. The inside isn't that big or comfortable, so I likely wouldn't ever eat there, but their takeout is excellent and very fast. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic pho.

I like how this place is boderline grimey, it feels like it's been here forever and the kitchen pumps out bowl after bowl after bowl of delicious brothy noodles.  

The pho is always delicious but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. It's not the best in the city, perhaps at one point it was but in more recent years I feel the broth has lost some zing, some magic.

The meat and toppings aren't the largest helpings and I would say are less than average.  Be prepared to get the large or extra large to fill your pho-racious cravings.

I would go again if in the area but not worth the pilgrimage anymore."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot, until I went back here recently. I've been coming here for quite a while now on a regular basis, but I won't be coming back any more with my friends.

The smaller portions (same price, less stuff) and the disgusting attitude of this waiter has turned me off one of my formerly favourite pho places.

1) The large USED to fill me up, but now it's just extra noodles without extra meat!! What a rip off. I need 2 Larges to feel full. So I'd be paying $20 just to have a decent-sized meal.

2) The tall, super talkative waiter I got the last time was also super creepy. I have NEVER had him serve me before, but I guess he's the son of the owner.

While I was seated, he made a number of UNPROMPTED cracks to people waiting in line saying:

\"If you wait or don't wait in line to get seated, I DON'T REALLY CARE EITHER WAY.\"

The straw that broke the camel's back was when a new couple had come in and didn't know the process that he had JUST MADE UP about filling in your order beforehand (but you don't hand him any piece of paper or anything to let him know you are next in line). 

He then accuses them of being cheaters for not having filled in a form that he didn't even mention or hand to them, or say anything about.

To make matters worse, he points to another family in line saying: 
\"THESE are the kind of people we want eating here. They're NICE people. They aren't CHEATERS.\"

OMFG are you kidding me? It's an effing line for some effing soup.

If you have a process in place that you want people to follow, let them come in, smile, hand them a paper, tell them they're next on the list, make a note and that's IT.

And you know what? Nice people like my friends and I who WOULD wait in line quietly, are not going to come back because this waiter felt the need to call this couple out and point out a (Vietnamese) family he preferred to eat there.

Don't want money? Don't worry. You won't be getting mine any more.

Horrible. 

Back to Pho Linh. 

That waiter is a creep.

(Oh and did I mention that after eating the food I became nauseous and slightly dizzy? The amount of MSG they put in their soups must have increased.)"}
{"text":"Been my favourite pho place in Toronto but today great disappointment.  Ordered a BBQ Chicken on Rice but the amount of chicken shrunk by 1/2."}
{"text":"My go-to is #12 - rare beef pho. Portions are really good, especially the amount of meat they give compared to other places. My only beef with them (har har no pun intended) is that the broth is a bit heavy and meaty whereas I prefer a more clear and light broth, not a huge issue though, I can suck it up. Another thing I don't like is how they charge $4 for iced coffee with condensed milk when it's served in a plastic cup and half of the cup is filled with ice. Like everyone else mentioned, this place is cash only - no debit or credit accepted, regardless of amount spent."}
{"text":"It's okay. I don't know why everyone seems to rave of this place. The pho broth isn't deep in flavour at all. Nothing special about it. And the spring rolls, although delicious & super crispy, are thin, with only 4 small rolls to an order.

I'd rather go Pho Linh, which is only another 5-10 min. away. 

Also, I seen the owner the other day, who coincidently were family friends with the people I ate with. He was kind and talked to all patrons, even the non-Asian ones.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Funny story....

My brother and I a few years ago, came here on the morning of Christmas eve at 11am. We were expecting nobody there and all the hipster yuppies were sound asleep... but instead, it was filled with vietnamese people ordering up pho and every delicious meal. They must be doing something right!!!! But seriously.... so delicious and satisfying."}
{"text":"I had their vegetarian pho with vegan broth. The veggies were fresh and taste was excellent. My friends asked me if I can taste the difference between vegan broth or chicken broth. I honestly couldn't, maybe they just put a lot of MSG in it. They also had other vegetarian choices on the last page of the menu. Price was fair and the boss was nice enough to convert US dollars to Canadian dollars for us"}
{"text":"Good pho, good service.  Solid!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this pho restaurant. Tons of people have claimed it to be the \"best pho in Toronto\". So, I just had to check it out myself. And let me tell you, they definitely did not disappoint.

My friends and I came \"pho\" the pho (ok bad joke); we ordered the house special. The others ordered bun bo hue. And to quench our thirst, there's nothing more classic than the traditional Vietnamese iced coffee and an avocado shake.

Firstly, the pho. It was deep enough in flavour, a refreshing sense to your palatte, and just a feel of home. And thankfully, the broth can be easily identified as MSG free.

I sampled a bit of the bun bo hue and it was spectacular. It was so hearty and intense in taste. You've got everything you want in your bun bo hue -- pig's blood, pig's feet, great spicy level to the soup. There is definitely no other way you would want it.

The iced coffee was strong and sweet. There's a good amount of strength compared to other Vietnamese coffees I've had around the city. The avocado shake was a tad too thick for my liking but on a nice warm day like it was, it certainly made a great ice cream-like texture for a dessert.

What really got me was how friendly the servers were. Typically, Vietnamese restaurants have servers in a crazy rush. They're quick to address your needs and just bring your stuff to you. The servers checked up on us a few times. They were attentive and even really friendly that they would converse with us. They accidentally forgot to make our drinks as we finished eating. When we brought it to their attention, our group watched the entire staff hustle and get our drinks out ASAP. 

If you're on Ossington, I would definitely pick this place over Golden Turtle. Turtle is much more mediocre in comparison in terms of their quality of food. The atmosphere isn't as comforting but that's how you know you're in a legit Vietnamese restaurant.

I would definitely come back again to try their other dishes!

Btw, they're cash only, but they have an ATM on hand. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"One of the best in Toronto. Plenty of street parking on a not so busy street.

Service is fast and friendly. 

Pho is yummy and they put in lots of veggies if you order more.  Meat is tender, and fatty if you request it."}
{"text":"Love Pho Forever!!!

Pho Tien Thanh definitely is the better pho place on Ossington. After watching a youtube video with Kai Bent-Lee eating here, I really wanted to try this place. It did not disappoint at all. 

I ordered a medium size beef special pho and spring rolls. The spring rolls are definitely different than other Vietnamese places. The rolls were not massive but are really thin and do not have that much filling in them. They taste alright. The pho is definitely the highlight of the meal as the broth, noodles and beef compliment each other perfectly. I was not that thirsty after my meal. 

They have an ATM machine in front of the restaurant and my first impressions of the interior decor were not great. Lets just say its really basic.I usually pay at the back. 

Service was great and food comes out pretty quickly. Does anyone notice that their hoisin sauce is more liquidly compared to other places? 

Overall, good vibes and good food. My good to place for pho if I am ever around the Queen and Ossington area."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this as the best pho in Toronto.  I had an amazing experience. The broth was very delicious. The spring rolls were some of the best I've ever had. Also tried the avocado milkshake and it was possibly the best thing on earth at that point in time. Great place for well priced food.

Note: this place is CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM in the restaurant if you don't have cash on you."}
{"text":"very surprised to see this joint is rated below 4 stars on yelp. lets try to change this:

meal: as always, rare beef pho, medium or large, extra herbs. sometimes I order the rice wraps with bbq pork (but ill limit the review to the main dish: pho)

service: 3 \"nice guy\" servers, but they are quite slow, and forget any additional things which you order (i.e. extra herbs)..

food: 4 meat is always thin, tastes good. broth is quite delicious and flavorful, but is strongly on the salty side (MSG galore). consistency in this place is is one of the strengths for sure. 

price: 5 outstanding, still, even after they raised prices to around 8$ for large, but with the global trends towards higher pricing of staples, who can blame them? 

portions: good, sometimes skimpy on the meat, but usually good.

facilities: 2 this place is run down as it gets, but in a strange way, it adds to the overall experience...

overall, just killer value .. beats all other places on all criteria... this joint will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Super legit local pho place that looks like a total dive and feels like grandma's house. Low price tag, huge portion, very tasty. Love the tea that comes with the food, and the rolls we ordered as appetizers were delicious as well. They just need to provide some more raw onions for the pho and I'll be set. 

Then I see the guy next to us order place his order and receive a bowl of bright red liquid. OH MY GOD. I need that in my life. Return trip is in order. 

Docked one star because it's tough to get a server's attention and the rules of how you order/pay should be posted somewhere for first-timers. But now that I know, I AM RETURNING FOR SPICY PHO!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh roll with BBQ beef (not on the menu, but my all time fave)"}
{"text":"Tasty soup and nice milk shake! Try the rare beef! Beef balls aren't that good though.."}
{"text":"YES YES YES! I FEEL ALIVE!!!

In a previous review I gave PTT a solid 5* whammy and also proclaimed it the best pho spot in the city. I have no idea why it took me SO long to return to the promised land but my god, tonight I was blown away like Tommy Lee & Jeff Bridges, quite like the first time I ever graced a PTT bowl. 

I have been recently arm wrestling with a minor cold and decided earlier I could really use a solid bowl of fuh. After slayin the Lg #23 at PTT (Beef Lover's Delight) I felt like a million+ bucks, and strong enough to flip a TTC bus. One of the best bowls I have ever had in my life. 

Bowl Breakdown:

Before adding any herbs, sauces, limes or sprouts to my bowl, I always try the broth solo, this is a crucial step in determining the value/worth of a pho establishment. Taking my first sip tonight I was completely mesmerized by the amount of flavour packed into a single spoonful (1 tbsp) of this broth, this Clear broth might I add. It may as well of been pho absinthe the way it was making me high. 

Apart from the broth (made with Unicorn saliva), the beef was bountiful and the onions, herbs and noodles made for quite the party in my mouth, the flavour profile was definitely at capacity. 

Service was nothing shy of great as usual. Our waiter was welcoming, efficient and polite, as he should be. I failed to catch his name, but he is always there and bless his soul. 

Surely my favourite spot for pho. I can not stand GT down the road and I could blast them for days but that is not the purpose of this review. The purpose here is to shine a light on the already blinding Pho Tienh Thanh. My home away from heaven. 

In closing, I would like to mention that the art of making Pho is a tedious, precise, and time consuming art which can take anywhere from 8 hours to a day to perfect, it's by no means a simple task. This means that the end product can mildly differ at different times based on the water, bones, veg and spices used that day. I have read some of the other posts by fellow Yelpers proclaiming the broth is nothing to write home about. If that's the case, then some fairy must be lacing my taste buds with pho fun dip each and every time I eat here. 

See for yourself, if you haven't already.

Pho Tien Thank You"}
{"text":"This place is busy and loud But good and cheap food considering the locality.The best seller is the Pho.I tried the deep fried egg noodles with stir fry veggies and tofu in a chicken broth.The portion sizes are pretty big"}
{"text":"This restaurant has such amazing reviews on Yelp, we had to give it a try! It was quite packed on a Friday night but we managed to get a seat for two. The interior is a little dated and could be cleaner, but not unusual for a pho place. Price-wise, it's a little more expensive than other pho places - around $9 for a small bowl. Portions were definitely smaller than expected but the broth and noodles were decent. Not sure I will be back again, but definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and craving pho."}
{"text":"The Pho is unbelievable. Really incomparable to any of the other joints in the city. The broth is super flavourful and service is quick as well. Lives up to its \"I LOVE PHO FOREVER\" banners on the wall."}
{"text":"By far one of the best PHO restaurant in Ontario! FYI: this is coming from someone who's not a pho fan.   I must say this place's pho has been CONSISTENTLY mouth-watering!  I generally eat pho twice a year but am now reconsidering my food choices.  Oh...and their Vietnamese ice-coffee (with condense milk) is definitely a KICKER."}
{"text":"The broth is amazing here. 

The Pho Tai - amazing. The broth is so flavourful and delicious. The beef was super tender. I also asked for veggies in my pho, and got way more than expected. 

The spring rolls - amazing! Crunchy and delicious.

The mango shake - super thick but tasted fresh. No fake flavouring. 

Decor - nothing fancy. Just your standard pho restaurant. But the food is great!

This Place is cash only. But they have an ATM on site."}
{"text":"I suspect new management. This can be the only explanation for the sudden change in quality, quantity and price jump. Quality has really slipped, portion size is down and the price is now the highest in the city. They also have MANY issues registered with the board of health for infractions. What was once the best is now ordinary at best. They raise the price (which I have no problem with) and lower the quality (this I have a problem with). The Chicken Pho has half the chicken as before. Raise the price and lower the standard. No thanks! I would once drive from Riverdale to Ossington for a bowl of this Pho, no more and I am sure I am not alone. Sad to see such a good place deteriorate. 

I'm in the market for a new Pho place at the standard that this place once was. Any suggestions? I'm open."}
{"text":"The pho was great. The broth in particular was amazing. Lots of beef provided. The pad Thai was just ok... Go for the pho instead :)"}
{"text":"As a non-Vietnamese person, I used to only order pho (usually \"number 1\") because I didn't know any better, but ever since my Vietnamese friend introduced me to Bun Rieu, which is a tomato-based noodle soup with seafood, I've been looking for a good Bun Rieu place. 

When I moved to Toronto from New York, I heard of this place, so I decided to give it a try, and the Bun Rieu I had here was nothing like I've had before. I'm so glad that I found this incredible place."}
{"text":"Sweet Christ my mouth is on fire.
5 for the delicious pho
1 for the current quagmire I find myself in.

So I'm out enjoying a lovely night of trivia, who doesn't? 
I decided to treat myself to some pho, who wouldn't?
I decided to get the pho to go, who I shouldn't have? Me.

The pho, though delicious, came compartmentalized in two to go bowls and a sack full of veggies and sauces and such such. Nothing fully fit into the other and though my make your own pho experience was a delicious experience it was also hellish and my trivia knowledge fell exponentially."}
{"text":"I haven't really tried pho but if I ever wanted to, this is apparently one of THE places to do it.  However I have to give my critique on the non-pho dishes...

Without fail, every time I have been there (3 now) I always end up finding hair in my dish...its probably why I have refrained from eating there in a while.  The food isn't too bad...until the hair.  I swear its like they see me, and put one in intentionally :(

However the service is ultra fast and the mango shake is amazing (and always without hair).  Volleyball season is coming up so I know I'll end up there again...maybe I'll try the PHO but i'm too worried I'll be super paranoid about getting a hair in my meal :(

The crowd usually comprises students and it is a cash only location (there is a cash machine across the street at the quasi-bakery)."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pho you will have in toronto! The place itself is run down but that's a good thing! It's been around its made it and it's pho real! It is the perfect broth perfect noodle and the bbh is also the best in town! Top 3 best pho in Toronto  pho sure!!! I live far from it or else I would be here once a week!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've had. Price was very good for a large pho. Come for the pho! No A/C and cash only."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai place on this strip and boy does it have good deals!! I was stuffed after we came here after having a solid three- four plates being shared only costing 20 dollars each-wow unheard of much! Plus it was leftover central. Everything had great authentic flavour and was an amazing palate pleaser! Quick service and was on point!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Friendly people, good service and amazing food! If you're looking for a Pho joint in the city, look no further this is the spot!!!!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a dump. But this dump makes the best Pho I've tried in the city! The broth is light, delicate and not even a bit greasy greasy... and I don't need to drink 2 gallons of water after a medium bowl because of all the MSG in it, either.

I always order the #13 with rare beef and tendon. The portions or meat are generous and the tendon was soft and delicious. You also get lots of basil, sprouts and lime. 

I know we all have variations on what we think of as great Pho, but this one hit it out of the park for me. I'll be coming back here-- not for the service or the decor, but for that delicious broth and the added value factor: the medium pho is more than enough for me and is packed full o' yummy Vietnamese goodness."}
{"text":"This place has been in business for many many years so they must be doing something right. It looks ghetto but that's part of the experience of a Vietnamese restaurant. It wouldn't be the same if it was all clean and modern. Granted it would be nice if they expanded. Known to be the best in Toronto this place is almost always packed in the evening so don't be surprised if you have to wait just to be seated in a row of tables with people sitting 1 or 2 chairs away from you.

Service is always nice even at peak hours and the wait time for food is very minimal.

Cheap meal and a bargain for the quality and authenticity you're getting. This is the closes thing to Vietnamese cuisine we have in Toronto. Definitely worth a try 100%."}
{"text":"I ordered Bun Bo Hue, my husband shared a large Pho with my daughter, and we ordered spring rolls to share. My meal was good, the flavour and broth were nice, but a little too spicy (I can handle heat). My husband enjoyed his Pho and we all thought the spring rolls were tastey. Our bill was about $26 including drinks, pretty good deal for everything we ordered. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I used to be a regular at pho hung back in the day, so when the opportunity came up to try vermicelli again, I was not going to say no. 

My bf told me about this spot on Ossington and warned me that \"it wasn't going to be fancy at all.\" He was right, it has a cafeteria look and it's anything but fancy, but my stir fry chicken vermicelli (bun) was so great. I also had some of the pho and the broth was delicious. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night, but service was quick. The waiter was in a really good mood, he was even singing. You can't beat a $25 dollar dinner for two.

Note: Cash only."}
{"text":"The taste of the pho that I ordered is okay. But the veggie came with pho wasn't fresh, some even seems like rotten. Soup was warm, so raw beef won't cook too well. Spring roll skin smells like kitchen cloth."}
{"text":"Their pho is vey authentic. My family had a pho restaurant and we tend to be very critical when it comes to pho's broth. We tried different pho restaurant in the u.s. and Toronto. This place has been the winner so far!"}
{"text":"I rarely give a 1 star, but the service here is getting worse and worse. So what if you have good pho? I've been coming here regularly for a while but the service is getting slower and slower, and Sunday was the last straw. I was there around noon with some friends waiting to be seated, and stood patiently for about 30 min. The tall, usually nice guy, acknowledged me at first but then proceeded to seat the vietnamese family that came after me. I let that one go, and when he asked me again how many people were in my party which was 5, he proceeded to tell me I had to wait longer since there were small groups behind me and he had seating for them immediately. Meanwhile, my pregnant wife was waiting for food. When I turned around to ask her if that was ok, he told me that its ok I don't understand him and gave me a sarcastic look. Nevertheless, I turned around and walking to golden turtle. This place is a dump, bad service, slow food, I hope it closes down and turns to a new hip bar on ossington."}
{"text":"My group of 4 came in at 12:15 pm today and it was only a quarter full. We got a seat right away and all order number 17(pho). This place is only known for pho and  #17 is most popular. Everything else is mediocre. Anyways the soup tasted different it's not the same as before, it has a strange sour zesty taste to it, and it's not just me my friends said the same thing. I notice the owner whom I did have a chance to talk with before wasn't around, and he was always around. I also didn't see his son whom I assumed it's his son just my speculation. The son has a high pitch voice but never the less very nice guy.Anyways pho taste wasn't the same and the beef cut \"ve don\" was also not as soft, it was chewy and tough. Mind you they were very consistent with their pho before, but these last few times I did not see the owner and food was off . So I suspect they sold it and kept the same name since it's a popular restaurant and owner in retirement. Anyways they used to have lineups almost everyday during peak hours. I was happy I didn't have to wait for a table but food wasn't worth a trip for me."}
{"text":"The pho here is close to perfect! I usually like to order a small pho special with extra beef balls and oh my it's filling! the noodles are thin, you get a nice variety of mixed herbs, prices are spot on, and I'm digging the extra meat menu (not that you'd need it)

Twice I've been and the service has been pretty nice, sure they might come off as a  little shouty, but hey they're Vietnamese (I'm vietnamese also, when having a normal  conversation with my mum it sounds like we're yelling at eachother)

Anyway! The best pho I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"*this review isn't based on the pho.
i, infact hate pho.

But everything about this place was about right in terms of the dishes they do offer.  I got the vermicelli with bbq beef and spring roll.  about 7$.
The place is clean, but sterile.  but you don't come to viet places for the decor

It is a great place for the neighbourhood, but for my viet fix i would rather go to ginger in the village any day.

I feel bad only giving it 3/5, because in terms of the neighbourhood, qualiyu and price it really should be at least 4.

but given that i don't live in a viet food desert, i'm judging it based on viet restaurants in general."}
{"text":"This is the best vietnamese pho restaurant in the Country! I've been to all the other places that people claim are the best, here and in other provinces but none of them come close to pho tien thanh. The broth here is in a elite league of its own. The only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because they take cash only and the place is too small to handle the crowds, that sometime you have to share tables with strangers. But it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is responsible for Pho becoming my main comfort food. I come here twice a week. My go-to: rare beef Pho with the meat on the side (so beef goes in when broth has slightly cooled). Cold rolls are great, and mango smoothie is the real deal. I don't even want them to paint over the salmon coloured walls, dim the lights, or replace the old school Asian art. It's perfect just the way it is."}
{"text":"Arrived at Pho Tien Thanh around 1 on a weekend and this place was packed with a consistent line up out the door. I am unsure if this pho restaurant had a line up because their pho was that good or because the usual customers at the Turtle pho restaurant down the street needed a quick pho fix (because that pho place was closed). The wait time was 20 minutes max and food was around 10 minutes.

I got the medium pho dac biet and it was delicious. Pretty decent broth with enough meat to accommodate the rice noodles. Your average but yummy pho! I also got the iced coffee with condensed milk and true Viet coffee is the best iced coffee. Super good iced coffee too but they put too much ice. For $4, you're getting 50% iced coffee in that cup. Still delicious.

Because this place is a local favourite, the servers do a good job at handling the rushes. However, I am unsure if the cleanliness is compromised as I've seen some things not so clean. Oh well, delicious pho anyways! Lastly, this place is cash only. ATM is available and TD is a short walking distance away."}
{"text":"I will never give my business to this place again. I have seen many times their owners steal tip money and put them in his pockets.
It is bad enough that they only pay their servers $7/hr and also deduct 40% of the tips. But on top of all that you steal more tips. These people are trying to make a living while they're in school. It is very greedy to be treating employees that way. 
Places like this should not be around!!"}
{"text":"Good ratio of viet customers and white people. I love that the owners are true viets and not Chinese! 

Came here on Sunday at 520pm. Glad we came early because by 540 there was a crowd at the door. The service was slow, got our food 20min later but it was busy so I can't blame the only 2 dudes working. 

Got a small pho with rare beef and beef balls. The rare beef was actually rare and not frozen! Yay! The broth was lovely, it was light and not oily. The downfall is, there was barely any noodles in the bowl. Finished it in a good 5 big bites.. a little dissapointed as ive read in other reviews that they had big portions. 

They also had soda Xi muoi which was a plus for me. 
Will come again and try the BBH"}
{"text":"I got to admit that I have become a fan of this place.

It may not be the cleanest place but they sure know how to cook a mean bowl of Pho!  Definitely one of the best places ive gone to for pho.

Upon request, they serve cold tea / boil your bean sprouts / they have chillie peppers that will leave your tounge numb if you soak up the seads!

Beer could be a little cooler and it sometimes gets a little foggy inside because of the poor ventaliation.  

Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe my pho expectations are too high these days but this place is just okay.  I've been twice and it's not bad at all, just not the mmmmm delicious I want from pho. 

The noodles are okay, the meat is cut too thick and sometimes chewy, but I love their broth so I'll keep going back.

It gets pretty busy at dinner so expect a 5-10 min wait."}
{"text":"Great place for pho. Best one in the area!.Service was really quick and the servers were so nice and funny to us. CASH only!"}
{"text":"So torn..  I really like the pho but everything else is kinda meh.  Ordered a BBQ pork and meatball bun (vermicelli) and it was crazy dry.  The spring rolls were like the size of fingers.

Guess this is a pho only kinda place."}
{"text":"Visited here the other day with my wife & daughters. It was highly recommended by a Vietnamese friend who says it's one of the best in Toronto. I had the rare beef & brisket (medium) and it was delicious, although certainly not the best I have had in Toronto. There was a good amount of meat included, but I have been to other places that had more. The clientele seemed to be mostly asian, which I guess is a good endorsement. As others have said, the decor is a bit tacky with the pink walls and service was 'clinical'. 
On a negative note, I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the bathrooms."}
{"text":"When ever I want a hot bowl of soup I come to this spot on ossington, the Pho is delicious and comes with a variety of fresh seasonings/ add ins on the side. The place is always busy, but there is so much seating that the table turnover goes by really quickly! It's very casual, seating is communal, it's a fun bustling environment.

Besides the Pho, the deep fried spring rolls are a MUST! As well the Vietnamese ice coffee is my favourite!"}
{"text":"My own personal phology continues with a recent addition to the list....

Pho Tien Thanh is located on the tail end of Ossington and is another cheap and cheerful Pho joint. As with Melissa J., I also think that Tien Thanh serves a better bowl of Pho than it's counterpart up the street-the Golden Turtle.

Broth is robust and served piping hot, wafts of anise and beef, a rich beefy broth. Noodles aren't fresh, a shame but at least there's plenty of raw beef to cook in the tasty broth. The pho has generous sprigs of cilantro and onion dumped in the soup beforehand so if you're a hater of both you may want to have them removed when you order. The herb plate comes with all the standard fixins and it's worth noting as I always do that they have saw-leaf included on their plate-not every Pho joint provides this unique herb.

The cold jasmine tea they provided was perfect too. Service is quick and efficient and as with most pho places this is cash only.

It's a slurp-worthy bowl of pho overall and I'll be back for more helpings."}
{"text":"What's not to like?
1.  Authentic Vietnamese restaurant where you can actually hear the workers speaking Vietnamese.
2.  The best Pho in Toronto and the ONLY place where I eat my Pho AND drink the broth without getting the MSG bloat in me tummy!  
3.  Broken rice is so yummy even though it's just rice.  Psychological?  Maybe, but I still order it and eat it with relish - by relish, I mean enjoyment and not really relish the condiment. ;-)

The one complaint is that the spring rolls compared to Golden Turtle suck bollocks here!  And this puzzles me.  Considering the history/feud between the two owners of these two restaurants, how is it that one can do the spring rolls to almost a god-like perfection (Golden Turtle), while the other just fails so miserably in comparison???

Well, the opposite is true with the Pho.  Golden Turtle sucks bollocks while PTT kicks bollacks!!!  

I wish one of these guys would get both right so I can enjoy my Pho with my spring rolls in one sitting instead of picking one restaurant over the other depending on my mood for sp or pho!  Life.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"Came here after Yelp's Crapy Hour Elite party to grab a bite to eat.  This is your typical pho joint although a step lower, because what Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have the staple that is BANH XEO on their menu?  (FYI Banh Xeo is a Vietnamese Crepe made with bean sprouts, mung beans, scallions and shrimp that is served with lettuce and a healthy dousing of fish sauce).

We ended up opting for a Spring Rolls to start, which are definitely crunchier than other places I've been to, and look nothing like the usual.  For one, these are more like \"cigars\" as they are very skinny and long.  A nice twist on the standard.  This comes with vermicelli, a few leaves of lettuce and julienned carrots.

For my main I opted for BUN RIEU which is a tomato-soup based noodle dish.  The noodles were cooked a little past al dente for me, and I was not a fan of the ingredients in it (pork blood jelly, pork hock).  The usual comes with shrimp, shrimp paste, pork meatballs and is more tangy.  Also, every soup noodle dish comes with your plate of bean sprouts and lime wedges which were nowhere to be seen.

My girl friend opted for a Grilled Chicken & Pork Rice dish.  She seemed to enjoy it, though the meat seemed really lean to me.  I prefer a little fat on my chops to get that juicy flavour.

I think the descriptions on the menu could be more helpful - newbies may be intimidated by it.

For my Ossington pho kick I think I'll stick with Rua Vang (Golden Turtle) as they have a more extensive menu and they recently renovated.

Damage came to $25 with tax and tip.  CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"This place is a hole-in-the-wall and you'll come out of this place sticky/humid with all your clothes reeking of pho and fish sauce, but you'll also come out totally satisfied.

While their prices are slightly higher than China town, I find the food much better. Portions are decently sized and the broth is delicious. I love the spicy broth add-on, which has a tomato/lemongrass taste to it.

This place is always packed but tables turn over quickly, so you won't be waiting too long."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, it's usually busy, but there always seems to be space for you.

I've had the raw beef pho a few times. I've followed the wise counsel of another yelper and ordered extra vegetables in it, as the basic soup doesn't have much besides a couple of strips of onions, the noodles and the beef. (And the sprouts, lime and herbs you get on the side.)

Today I branched out and tried #33, the spicy beef soup. The broth is not that spicy. It's the kind of soup that gets yummier as you slurp your way down to the bottom. The portion of beef was generous.

I gotta say I was teeny bit of jealous of the guy next to us who'd ordered a whole plate of raw beef to add to his spicy broth. The beef in our soup was more done, not much pink left. Another tip for trying out next time."}
{"text":"By far the best Pho restaurant in Toronto. Their rare beef is amazing as it also enhances the flavour of the soup. Whatever you decide on, your taste buds will be treated well."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know why this place is rated so high. I had the large house special and there were barely any noodles/beef in it. I left still hungry and was so thirsty from all the msg they put in it. The pho also gave me the worse fatigue I've ever felt, so I'm really wondering what they put in there. 

I don't expect much from a pho restaurant, but this one was especially dirty and the washrooms were super sketchy and dirty. There are many better options for pho, not sure why this one is rated so high."}
{"text":"We came here after a CrossFit workout. The top part of the first page of the menu is vegetarian and a vegan broth is available. Medium size is quite filling. Pho is tasty. Service is quick. Restaurant was packed yet it was super quiet as everyone was basically whispering.

Overall I'm happy with my experience and I will surely visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One does not walk into here expecting coat check and attentive, friendly table side chat. It's a dingey looking hole in wall that wants their turn over ... With that in mind we are always happy with the bowl of pho they serve up, and prefer it to the Golden Turtle up the street. The broth is great, really fragrant and the pieces of beef tender. Go-to place to satisfy a pho craving."}
{"text":"Having been out drinking most the afternoon and evenng, my friends and I needed something to eat and headed for pho.

This place is not much to look at, however the food is good and cheap!
I got distracted by the menu and ended up opting for the beef, shrimp and pineapple stir fry, tasty! What I liked about the menu was that some of the dishes had a mixture of meat and spring rolls so you could have the best of both.  

Spring rolls looked really good and crispy!

Service was fast and friendly, very accommodating given that nine of us piled in just before the kitchen was about to close.  

Next time I need to not get side tracked by the rather delicious stir fry's but get me some pho, pho'sure!"}
{"text":"Best pho place in the city. i choose the pho ga and the deep fried rolls are the bomb. Love this place. Very cozzzzy.... family run."}
{"text":"A pre theatre dinner fix just before going to @lotheatre for a show, we came here partly because Golden Turtle was closed and it got higher reviews.  

The verdict seems mixed, but I think its a solid 3 or 4 stars.  The pho is a bit more expensive than other chinatown places, but we're talking $1 or 2.  

The decor is nothing, but with lots of people inside, it cozy.  

The pho broth was less MSG-y and seemed to taste fresher.  The  noodle  to beef ratio was good and  in the  Special bowl you get a combo of rare beef, brisket, tripe and tendon. 

The hubby opted for non-pho, which I dont think we'll recommened.  The beef lemon grass on rice looked like bulgolgi and something we could have made at home  He complained it wasnt filling enough. 

We also got the deep fried spring rolls, good, but not as expected.  It basically thin, no filling, oily and crunchy. there are 4. If you like that, get it. 

Our meal was $20 for two, so cannot complain that much.  I was cold with the door opening and closing. Long line up around 730pm"}
{"text":"Came back for another bowl of pho since I'm in town and it's still delicious! Planning to go back tomorrow before leaving Canada"}
{"text":"Very fresh condiments this place has solid reviews and it is indeed good but this may be a preference for me- the broth was too light and watery for my tastes. The soup is fresh but not tasty enough. Service is friendly and decor is welll....not a strength. Solid but not spectacular."}
{"text":"I always get #9 the Dac Biet pho (house special). I find it's always consistent there and always busy no matter what time you go at. It's a place where you have to be comfortable with a loud environment and being seated in close quarters."}
{"text":"I frequent this place whenever I'm in the downtown area. It's probably one of the top two places for pho in all of Toronto. My relatives who grew up in Vietnam debate whether Pho Tien Thanh or Pho Dau Bo on Finch Ave West serves the best bowl of pho in Toronto. One sign of authenticity that you will notice is that a lot of Vietnamese people eat here because of how good and authentic the food is.

Normally I order the Pho Dac Biet (special) or Pho Ga (Chicken).

The pho is near perfection. The broth is excellent, the noodles are always cooked to perfection (not undercooked or overcooked), the quality of meat is really good, thinly sliced and not filled with fat like other places that are trying to cut cost. The tendon is of a nice quality. The accompanying vegetable plate always has fresh bean sprouts, mints, lime and sawtooth herb which many places skimp on.

Service: The people are really nice but sometimes the delivery of the food while dining in can be quite slow which is a little puzzling for pho.

Decor: Minimal decor, washrooms are borderline clean but ppl come here for the great food and not the ambience.

Pricing: A little bit more expensive than other pho restaurants but not by much and the portions are a little bit smaller.

Interesting note: I was talking to the owner and he told me he use to own a Vietnamese restaurant called Viet Huong on the S/W corner of Sheppard/Brimley in Scarborough over 10 years ago. If anybody remembers the place, it use to be one of the go to places for pho in Scarborough way back in the day."}
{"text":"Eh. Food took a while to come out, but the taste? Decent. Pho is still better here in Houston. Oh yea, I liked how we were given a tall pitcher of water so that we could give ourselves refills when we need it."}
{"text":"Pho was good , bun was not good at all with only one small shrimp. There was a hair in my food when I was almost finishing, so gross. The waiters are nice so I still left normal amount of tips, but I would highly suspect the hygiene of this place, I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Struggling with the age-old question of Pho Tien Thanh or Golden Turtle? Do yourself a favour and go to Pho Tien Thanh (also known as Pink Walls). Living less than 1 minute from both restaurants, I am confident I can give you the accurate answer that you need! 

Yes yes, Pho Tien Thanh does not have the patio that Golden Turtle has....but it's all about the food anyway - right?! Right! If you're really craving eating outdoors, take your food to-go and sit in the nearby Trinity Bellwoods Park, less than a 5 minute stroll away. 

Why do I love Pho Tien Thanh? The food is great, the service is fast (typical of most Vietnamese restaurants) and oh, the food is great! My personal faves are the vermicelli bowls and the spring rolls. The Pho, of course, is also highly recommended, but I wouldn't suggest getting it for take-out. Pho in general is just not a take-out friendly meal....too much raw meat to be carrying around. 

Now get out there an order a #67 at Pho Tien Thanh! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Best pho in Ontario. 

Whenever I work in the area, this is my place to go. The pho is exceptional: rich and flavourful broth, tender meat, al dente noodles, abundant side garnishes. The service is gracious and generally quick. The vegetarian dishes are weak, but most are in any vietnamese restaurant. Come for the pho and be happy you did."}
{"text":"Having tried pho all over Toronto and having eaten plenty of it in Vietnam myself, I will so boldly say... This is the best in the city! It's a small restaurant, but the serving staff are quick  and friendly for the most part. The broth isn't crazy fatty/oily, it has a delightful seasoning to it, authentic. Price is good, pho is great!"}
{"text":"Yummers....
Wifey loves Pho, and this place is the BEST...
We're Vegetarians, and their veggie broth Pho is the best we've tasted in the city (#1 goes to a Pho joint in Moncton NB of all places)

We're here once every couple weeks.  
So should you!"}
{"text":"Very casual but great food. I have never been disappointed here. The rare beef pho with the spicy broth is my personal favorite. I think it's run by a family, they are alway offer great customer service and definitely take pride in the food that they serve. If you love pho you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Put standard phrase here....    \"You get what you pay for\"

Special Beef Noodle Soup($7.50/Large) - Comes with full Garnishes of Culantro, Basil, Sprouts and Red Chili is a welcome sight.  The Large Bowl is quite big that reminds me of eating at Home.  The portion of ingredients however did seem held back especially the Tendon and Tripe was most notible.

The Broth and Pho itself seems average while the Broth slowly becomes cloudy when the Raw Beef soaks in and infuses the Broth.  Slices of Onions and chopped Scallions float on top while Dry version Pho sit at the bottom.

The setup of the place is less designed than Pho restaurants in the Suburbs but at least they are smart enough to have an LCD in one corner but instead of Vietnamese or Cantonese show or even CP24, it shows NFL Football.  I was still trying to figure out WHO was watching that from the full-house restaurant... Except for me."}
{"text":"Just came here for a late lunch in December. A few people have mention this place for authentic pho and I wanted to try it out. We ordered pho beef with beef balls, chicken and beef pho, spring rolls and salad rolls. Pho broth was great and condiments were different more herbs than the usual. Spring rolls were different than expected. Salad roll had the right mix of ingredients and no bean sprouts inside. Communal style tables and retro looking inside but the pho is worth the drive out to this end of the city. Cash only was a bit of a hassle."}
{"text":"Food is great!   Service is top notch.
Portions are large and prices very reasonable
Surroundings....uuuhhh  
A/C is not cold & Bruce Lee pictures are questionable decor"}
{"text":"To officially kick off Pho-bruary, we visited the much talked about Pho Tien Thanh on Ossington.  Yelp Elites Dale M. and Bijan V. were joined by Yelp newbie Jan A., whose dedication to the craft of pho is noteworthy (she just visited this place a few days ago).

+++The Good+++
1) Broth, though a bit cloudier than I like, was nice --not fantastic, but well above average.  Not too sweet or salty, but flavorful
2) Raw beef comes out blood red, not yet fully submerged/cooked in broth
3) Melt in your mouth tendon -- FINALLY!
4) The fried spring rolls are authentic (small with a different casing and a peppery filling)
5) Cheap!  $11 a pop with tip for a bowl of pho and shared apps
6) Free parking on side streets.  Wicked!

---THE BAD---
1) The pork skin rolls were neither here nor there (note: this does add a little something something when accidentally dropped in your tea)
2) They use dry noodles, not fresh

Overall, a lot better than Golden Turtle up the street and perhaps one of the nicer bowls of pho south west of Vic Park and Eglinton.  The rest of Pho-bruary will dictate its overall ranking."}
{"text":"Easily the best pho I've had in a long while. I had the rare beef pho and it was perfect in every way. I love the basil and sprouts they give on the side and there was an ample amount of noodles and beef. Not to mention the broth itself was perfectly seasoned. Service was quick and friendly as well. I left feeling full but not over or underwhelmed. 

Will definitely be coming back - my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Pho Tien Thanh serves pretty standard fare.  The food is tasty and the portions an expected size.  Nothing really stands out here, but it is pretty consistent and well priced.

Pretty much what I'd expect from a noodle joint in Toronto these days"}
{"text":"It's fast. Cheap and yummy!

They added an ATM now, just in case you forgot cash.

In the past I've ordered other items from the menu, and everything was okay! If you are looking for almost authentic pho place (besides home made), this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Place was average and looks like most viet restaurants. However, the prices were slightly higher given the neighbourhood but it would be better if the decor fit its location. Food was nothing special ranging from noodles and rice dishes.  The only dish that stood out was the salad with raw papaya. 

When we finished the meal, we got up to the counter and asked of the bill.  Service was limited. Without taking a close to the bill, I think we were given someone else's bill or they overcharged us. I likely won't be coming back next time."}
{"text":"Excellent Bo-riu soup, and friendly service. My only issue was that they took cash only and had no ATM machine on site. The seating is a bit awkward and people who don't know each other may have to sit at the same table at times.

Other than that , you can't argue that their pho is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a cutie Viet girl working at Wa bar. I tried it out the next day and, although it didn't disappoint, I must admit that I have had better Pho in SoCal. I was expecting more. The noodles were not as fresh and the broth not as beefy as I was accustomed to at my favorite places in the OC and LA. 

Its basically a hole-in-the wall place, which is fine. Doesn't have to be fancy. But it does distract from meal a bit. Still, a decent place to come on a cold day in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was rooting for this place but it has been a letdown for me so far. I believe it was my mistake for ordering a bún bowl rather than pho. I decided to order a bún bowl because it was warm out and having a pho bowl would make me all sweaty. The grilled chicken and spring roll bún bowl was just so disappointing. There was not enough chicken, nor were there mint leaves. The one spring roll that they gave me was really skinny and short and was pretty average in terms of taste. They could've given me two spring rolls, given their size. The vegetarian fresh rolls were okay...

I would give this place another shot though but I would only order their beef pho next time."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to this place for a long while but did not have the chance until recently. I heard a lot of praise for this place and to their credit the food did not disappoint. I had pho, Vietnamese spring roll and coconut shake. The food was authentic and well made. I found the portions on the smaller side for the price. The spring roll was unique, very finely made and I found it \"elegant\" and tasty. The pho was \"real\" and tasty but not delicate.
I would return only if in the area. I would not drive downtown (from Oakville where I live) to eat there."}
{"text":"The best pho tai in Toronto. Meat is very nice, tender and soft!! I highly recommend you this place"}
{"text":"In my mind this is a place strictly for pho. Their pho is really good and everyone is having it.  We ordered some fried spring rolls and they were as thin as cigars with just nothing discernible in them. My dining partner ordered pad thai (which I discouraged) it arrived when I was finishing my pho. The servers (although very pleasant) don't time the dishes or do anything extra to help you enjoy your meal. eg. not bringing or offering a glass for beer. I've been coming here for years and although the place was packed and business has probably improved from 10 years ago they've done nothing to improve the decor or the drafty door. I'll be back but only for the pho."}
{"text":"One of the better places I have found in Toronto. Nothing can top Linh cafe in Vancouver but this is pretty good. They have a choice of 3 sizes and prices are reasonable. Decor is typical Vietnamese hole in the wall. It's pretty busy on the weekend during the lunch rush. 

The secret is to add the green onions in oil to your pho order. Put the onions and some of the oil in your pho. You will thank me!"}
{"text":"I don't like Pho Rua Vang. The staff are rude and it's way too crowded. My boyfriend once had an experience with broken glass in his shake to which they did nothing about. 

Since going to Pho Rua Vang was not an option, my S/O and his friends and I came here. It was a pretty good experience. Generally, when the four of us are together I always have a good time but I'm sure this place had some sort of contribution.

I'm vietnamese. The goi cuon was good (fresh rice paper shrimp and pork and veg rolls). My BF's pho was pretty good. I had a taste and liked it. I ordered the springrolls and the bbq meat (bun thit nuong cha gio) and there were several things wrong with it. I'm accustomed to having different noodles for that dish. I've never been to a vietnamese restaurant and had those noodles with what I ordered. The spring rolls were small and sad looking. They tasted okay but I could've made them better myself (but if I did it would defeat the purpose of coming out and having someone make it). The veggies even, they just weren't right. Also, I like to have some pickled radish and carrots with it but it's easily forgotten so it's okay.

The man who I think owns the store is extremely sweet. He was the person behind the front at the cash. The servers are nice and funny.

Rating Pho alone, it's my favorite new place in Toronto. I would definitely be back. (just not for the springrolls)"}
{"text":"Finally got around to settling the much debated Ossington pho challenge for myself.

Golden Turtle vs Pho Tien Thanh

Verdict - Different styles, no clear winner (what a cop out huh?)

Settling in Pho Tien Thanh on a cold winter day for lunch. I went with the standard - deep fried spring rolls and the rice noodle special, large. (i.e. a bit of everything, beef, tripe, tendon).

The spring rolls were crisp, thinner than expected and tasty. Sweet too, which is interesting and I must say, better than golden turtle.

Pho - ingredients much more sparse, less dressings as far as greenery, less beef and almost non-existent tripe. Disappointing. The broth is very clear, less oil but also less flavour and richness than golden turtle. I can see how some people would love this though. Noodles were fresh and just the right consistency. It is more a preference, but the portions and broth was better at Golden Turtle.

Overall, I think both places have quality pho in comparison to their brethren downtown. They each do something well and it is a matter of personal tastes when it comes down to which you prefer. I'm headed back to the turtle first but if it's full up, you'll see me jet over to Pho Tien Thanh in less than a minute."}
{"text":"best part of pho was broth, but that's just because it's loaded with MSG.
meat/ingredients were mediocre, seemed kinda of cut carelessly if that matters to you.
Also, found it too pricey.

6/10 would go again only if i lived in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've had in GTA, with a broth that tastes nothing short of amazing, the beef is rare and thinly sliced (though I could have used a bit more).  I come here for the pho and only the pho.  The decor is quite plain, they are cash only, and service is acceptable though not exceptional."}
{"text":"Not the best, had better in ssauga.
The soup is warm (should be hot)
Ingredients aren't fresh.
Way too much MSG (and salty)
Ding-y restaurant. 

It is authentic but not to my liking."}
{"text":"Absolutely not worth the stars. No idea why it's rated so high. The broth is overly sweet and artificial tasting. Look at the pic and see how many limes to neutralize the sweet. Pho Linh is way better. Cash only."}
{"text":"Pho Tien Thanh scratched my itch for pho but didn't go above and beyond my expectations. The soup and noodles were both decent but I wasn't a big fan of the beef balls. The restaurant is small and as a result it took awhile to be seated. The cutlery could have been cleaner. If I am in the area I would go back but wouldn't say it's my go to pho place in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best pho in the city, and possibly the world. We were lucky to have discovered this place because I moved nearby 5 years ago, but now that I am moving again, I will literally be going out of my way on a regular basis to come to this place. Kind of annoying that it's cash only, but oh man is it totally worth it. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Outside of the Housin sauce being watered down, the Pho Dac Biet was great.  I was hoping for more meat and maybe even the traditional meatball, but it was still excellent.   The fresh spring rolls (shrimp and pork) was excellent too, but the peanut dipping sauce was a little bland...but again still good.  I ordered extra for after the bars!"}
{"text":"Order in the past: special pho, medium-well to well-cooked beef pho, goi kho bo, goi cuon

(2/2) Price vs portion

(1/1) Taste + food presentation + drink 
+ fresh herbs and veggies 
+ rich broth that's not too salty
+ well cooked noodle strands
+ good amount of meats
+ appropriate priced beers with some import options
- boring dishware

(0.5/1) ambiance + customer service
- old shabby place but trust me, Viet food is almost always better at run-down looking places than newer and fancier establishments
- most servers are not very friendly but they are probably paid under minimum wage 

(0.5/1) Wow!
+ 0.5 taste, very authentic Viet food 

Recommendation for a good experience: Give good tips and be extra courteous if you plan to come back"}
{"text":"Your Pho is so good, i have to drive 40 minutes just for your Pho. Clear broth, awesome taste. Just keep your Pho like this please, best Pho in Toronto area i have to say"}
{"text":"This place is really busy on a Sunday afternoon. One thing I like about this place, if there is a table that seats 6 and there are 2 seats at the end, they don't try and place a different group of 2 there. I'm not sure if you ask they'd say no, but I appreciate being given space. I went as a group of 2 and another group of 2 at other end of the six seats, thus giving us space in between.

The young guy doing all the serving, he has some super energy. He was like talking a mile a minute and always had this bright smile on his face. He tells you to write your order before you sit so you don't wait as long to get your food,

I ordered the meatball, bbq pork, spring roll vermicelli for $8.25. The prices here aren't all that cheap, but I'd say they give you generous portions of meat which I appreciate as a guy. But this one I almost felt like I didn't have enough vermicelli. The flavor though is outstanding, the bits of mint"}
{"text":"There's actually two Vietnamese restaurants close by. This one apparently to my gf who came to Canada when she was 19 from Vietnam said was more authentic and definitely seems that way.

I ordered the Special Pho, and it was good. The broth seemed too salty. I like Pho better at Golden Turtle but the other types of foods, i like more at this place.

I suggest giving it a try, and look for chef special for some close to authentic foods."}
{"text":"Some of the recent reviews in the last several months are mind blowing - as in, harsh and unfounded - especially one where the reviewer wished this place \"should close down and made into a hip bar on ossington.\"

This is someone's livelihood we are talking about; did they personally do something to you on a scale so low that you want their place closed down with no good reason??

Anyway, on any given day that I have gone to this place - weekday, weekend, it is always full of patrons! Both sit-down dining and take out!  Speaks volumes for itself of the high quality of this place.

I have been a regular patron for years and I have never have had a bad meal here. Whether it's my favourite vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled meatballs and spring rolls, or their pho with rare beef and beef balls all have been super delicious and hits the spot oh so well.  I would eat here everyday if I could if it weren't for me living in Markham/Mississauga.

I always, always recommend this place to all Vietnamese food lovers alike.  

The service for the most part is good, I would not say excellent as they are a Vietnamese family run joint but they do try to be attentive.  The food always arrive quickly, even if it's busy which means the kitchen staff is well trained and efficient!

Yes, the takes only cash as payment is slightly annoying, I wish they would invest in a debit/credit machine for the convenience of their patrons.

See you all at Pho Tien Thanh sometime soon; my gf and I will be the ones silently enjoying our food, not uttering a word to each other as we are too focused on slurping down our pho! ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered an extra large and i kid you not i got 80% soup, so little noodle that i held all of it up on my chopstick and 4 slices of beef. Like really? They have more in a small order of pho at pho linh. Thats just next level cheapness. Want just me because i looked around and the lady next to me ordered extra noodles just to feel full even though she got an extra large too."}
{"text":"This is the spot for the best pho broth in the city. It's definitely worth the trek. And the lineup (which was crazy to see on a Sunday evening!). Order the house pho special (minus the tendon unless you like it) and you will be in heaven. Honestly the broth is so delicious and rich, you will have to agree that no other pho places compare. There's nothing else to say, just go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"My intro to PHO...  There are a few better in the city but this is a long lasting and quality spot.  Great Chicken, Rare Beef.  Spring rolls also excellent.  Decor is awful, bad tables, cheapest paint job, ever...  You go for the food, so it works."}
{"text":"Very simple place, nothing fancy but their pho is unreal! Probably the best pho I've ever had."}
{"text":"I was getting lunch and this place was around the corner. Ordered medium pho which was just enough for me. (I normally don't eat a lot)A little pricier than the other pho restaurants but normal price for Toronto I think. Taste was not bad though. Very busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Tien Thanh is THE BEST Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto... for pho at least. This is my go-to place whenever that craving hits, particularly in cold weather. The portions are always larger than most other pho restaurants and it always comes fresh. My visits to Tien Thanh have never been disappointing, though finding a seat sometimes is difficult. It's best to come before or after peak periods to ensure that you can be seated. I would definitely recommend visiting Tien Thanh for a delicious, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Everything was ok, They seem
Famous for their soup. We ordered peanut sauce and got soysauce with crushed peanuts on it. It is a busy place and the food came fast"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly disappointed with this joint, as I've heard great things. I find their springs rolls very thing, and not stuff with much meat. I ordered their Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, and found the portion to be small and very mediocre. What threw me off the most was the level of cleanliness of the restaurant. Used tissued paper on the floor, the tables weren't whipped down properly. If I'm in the area again next time, I will definitely be trying out other restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"Ok, so I came here again cause I was in the area and decided to give this place another shot.  The last time I was here it wasn't exactly mind boggling.  I was about to be proven wrong.

This time I came pretty much when they opened at around 11.  They actually let us sit down before they opened which is pretty nice.  I ordered the usual special with spring rolls (crunchy and fresh).

The soup base is legit.  It's not loaded with MSG and stock of whatever so it tastes homemade (ever have one that tastes like chicken stock? that sucks).  The cool thing is also that they load some pretty good ingredients into the special as well.  The beef was pretty tender (surprisingly cause it came out medium).

I think the most impressive thing about this place is the spring rolls they have here.  Their crunchy spring rolls are amazing.  They're a little bit smaller than other people's but they taste so much better.  Order 2 or 3 orders of them if you can, you won't be sorry.

Other than that, the fresh rolls are pretty average, the only thing I have to say is that don't really cut them for you, so... either get your rip on or just have it all to yourself =).  I vote for the latter."}
{"text":"1. The pho here is so rich! They actually heat up their bowls prior to serving the pho so the soup is kept warm longer.  
2. Viet coffee here is bomb 
3. The chicken here is also bomb"}
{"text":"Best soup base i've tried out of all the pho places i've been to! A bit more expensive than china town Pho but it's worth it. Decor is...hmm...not there. But it's clean enough for you to eat in it. The staff are friendly, and kept coming back to me to make sure i really wanted to eat pig's blood in my soup noodle. Maybe I don't look adventurous enough. Will come back if in the area, but it is a bit far from the ttc line."}
{"text":"This is a queen west staple. It's the go-to pho place for me and I've been living in the area for 10 years. If you're looking for a decent pho restaurant you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY

Got here at 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon with my co-worker and the place was half-full. Not a lot of servers, so it was a short wait before our order was taken. But this place filled up quick in the time that we were there. Server was soft-spoken, polite and attentive. We ordered the following:

Hot tea - came out piping hot - good old fashion black tea
Cafe Su Da aka Iced Coffee with condensed milk -- came in to go cup, tasted great 
Deep Fried Pork spring rolls - long and skinny, and sooo crispy and delicious! came with a side of lettuce and pickled carrots
Bun Bo Hue - Spicy with all the fixins (meat slices, jah slices, half a pork foot, pig's blood) ------ SOO DAMNN GOOD!!!
Pho Ga - Chicken noodle soup w/ rice noodles

Medium bowls were really big! I just barely finished mine, but my friend could only eat half of her pho ga.. The side of herbs and was plentiful! Lots of basil and bean sprouts, with the surprise of spicy red chili peppers (whole) and dandelion greens!!

I eat Vietnamese food regularly in San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles.. this place did a great job. Decor is not beautiful, and it can get hot inside when the air conditioner is not on. BUT the food was on point, and full of flavor. I would definitely eat here again and recommend it to anyone who wants real Vietnamese food in this area."}
{"text":"Convenience.  That's the key to this place's success.  I've given it several attempts but have finally concluded that this place is sub par.   
They skimp on the BBQ meat, the vegetables in the pho is lacking.   While the broth is well flavoured- The noodles are over done and they even water down the hoisin sauce; but - they are open on thanksgiving.   Convenient.  

One day, someone will open a competitor in the hood and this place will be a tacky decor nightmare.  

Oh and it's cash only-  an accountant's dream business !"}
{"text":"Been here three times as of this review; not sure whether it was because of this time (went during the Saturday lunch crowd), but the broth was really salty. The past few times I've gone, the broth was pretty good and drinkable. But this time, it was just borderline (I was glad I could finish my bowl of pho without downing several cups of water...)"}
{"text":"Good Pho place! Had the vegetarian pad thai and the veggie springs rolls. They were delicious. A very cozy environment, was quite busy when we showed up, but got seats within 15min. The staff was very friendly even informed me that after those two Vietnamese ice coffee drinks I had....That I would be up all night because they're very strong lol. All in all great place, check it out :)"}
{"text":"Seems like there is no place in downtown Toronto to get a bowl of pho for less than $7 nowadays.   My last vivid memory of this place was so incredibly miraculous.  Since that time, 2 years has passed and I went back thinking my last experience  couldn't be tainted.  I had compared every bowl of pho in the GTA-wide in relativity to this Ossington pho.  Remembering that the broth was rich, perfectly oily yet flavoured, with generous and thick servings of beef and noodle.  

After being 2 years away, I feel like my memory must be going because it hasn`t served me right.  When we ordered our two bowls of pho and a platter of spring rolls, the noodles were very sparsely tossed , even after comparatively assessing the large and small.  The beef condiments were OK but I was so disappointed in the portions and flavour department that the damage could not be undone.  When four very skinny, small, and still rice-paper white spring rolls made it to my table, I realized I could have done a better job at home.  Was it possible that I have too refined tastes or that I have become too harsh as a pho connoisseur?  Regardless, I will not be returning - there is now too much of a stretch between my expectations and reality.  

Both my boyfriend and I left like hungry, desolate asian children feeling quite unsatisfied after having two bowls of pho and a platter of spring rolls....... and we could, in that very moment, have been perfect candidates for a global hunger TV advertisement."}
{"text":"A bit grungey, but many pho places are. I found the broth too salty and the beef wasn't tender as other places I've tried. Place also felt a bit unclean. Not sure I'd come back to try it again."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a pho. The place is nice and cozy and was full. I ordered the rare beef pho so they serve you hot tea and cold water for free which is standard. They have sauces on the side to mix it with you pho. They make there own sauces from what I noticed they had the  hoisin sauce which was more liquids than what I am used to but it tasted the same. The pho was good and the broth taste good as well. 

The people working there donot talk much but they do they job they give you the menu with the paper to write your order then u give it to them and they provide the check when needed.

Liked the place if I am around will definitely check the place again."}
{"text":"Of the many scattered pho temples in Toronto, this is by far the best one. The first thing you'll notice upon being seated is the color of the walls,  an unusual off tint Pepto bismol pink. It is of no importance, as the soup is what you made the trip for. For starters, The broth is something born from near perfection. Clear and flavorful, with just the right mix of ginger, oil and spices, it is worth five minutes to savor on it's own. Next are the noodles. A smooth and velvety consistency, at first seeming like they may be a bit on the overdone side but they be very stray from that perfectly done consistency. And finally, the beef. The only ingredient of somewhat less preferential quality, it is nonetheless still very good. It's not outstanding, but it's very good. The spring rolls are unusual in their appearance but are tasty, the veggie version is best. Try the mango shakes as well as the broken rice. Gets compared to the pho place up the street a lot, but this is the true King of pho on Ossington. There are no substitutes."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered pho here. The vegetarian option is pretty good. The service is great, I'm always greeted by somebody when I enter. 

The decor isn't much to look at, but I'm not there to eat the walls. I recommend this place for a great bowl of pho."}
{"text":"I always have vegetarian noodle and vegetarian spring roll. Great food and good cost performance! Service is first and attentive. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I really don't get what the hype is on this place.  It is very average.  No better or worse than dozens of other Pho places around town.  Although you get to see a menagerie of bearded hipsters in lumberjack shirts.  I guess that sets it apart.

Pho is very simple - broth, meat, noodles.  That's it.  This place has beef and chicken broth, while most other places use beef only broth.  No better or worse, just different.  

We had the pho with tendon, tripe and rare beef.  The beef was a bit too rare, tripe was standard, tendon was a bit bigger than other places.  Ok pho, but nothing to rave about.  Just another Viet place.

The cleanliness could go up.  The service was ok, nothing out of the ordinary. 

Really, I don't understand all the raves.  Pho holes-in-the-wall like this one are dime-a-dozen around Toronto.   Asia21 Pho on king and dufferin has just as good Pho, if not better on the tendon part.  Everything else is similar.  Just one example of dozens."}
{"text":"If you need a sign to see if you want to eat here or not? here is the sign. GO EAT HERE. forget golden turtle. Their pho is far superior. Only place i go to even if im not in Toronto, ill mission my butt to Toronto to eat here. 

Best during cold weather like winter."}
{"text":"Well, we were hungry and craving Vietnamese food. 
Since we were in the area I decided to check on Yelp to see what everyone else recommended, and that's how I ended up here. 

Maybe I should of ordered the Pho since that is what they are known for but I decided to go with the vermicelli with beef and spring roll. 

Personally, this plate was nothing over the top for me and the portion was smaller than I'm used to at several other Vietnamese restaurants. 

This place seems to be very popular to the locals as it was full and new customers were instantly coming in. 
I can see this is a place you go to if you are really hungry and in a hurry as the environment is not that inviting. I'm not even sure if they had any a/c on but you definitely could not feel it. Our table was wobbly but they didn't seem to acknowledge or correct it. It was a very dated place and felt like it could use an update. 

The servers barely spoke English when I was there and they were there just to serve your plate and nothing more. No smiles no greetings. Just order your food and it will eventually arrive. 

So if you are looking for a quick bite and nothing extra, then I suggest you drop by. However, If you are looking for a dining experience, with friendly service and interaction try another Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"MUST TRY: rare beef pho

This is the purest of the pho.

Chomp on your noodles, savour your beef, and drink every last drop of broth. You will be satisfied.

I have had this at least 5 times and the broth quality was consistently high.

BONUS: at least 2x as good on a cold day"}
{"text":"Stepping in to this busy restaurant is like being transported back to the early 90s pho places I grew up in. The decor is old school, like CRT-TV-in-a-quilted-black-box-above-the-cash old school. The service is fast, efficient and moves as quick as possible - as expected on a busy Sunday night. I ordered a pho with medium rare beef and tendon (#13), but they mixed up my order and gave me tripe instead. After flagging a waiter down and explaining the situation, he came back with an apology and a bowl of tendon to add to my pho. I liked how they remedied the error quickly, even before my pho had time to cool down. 

The pho here is not fancy, but is done well and lives up to the expectations. The broth is flavorful, steaming hot and well balanced. The noodles are tender and the chosen topping are good. The rare beef comes floating in the broth and quickly cooks to a medium well in no time. The tendons come in large chucks but are soft and pliable, just how I like them. The side dish of bean sprouts, thai basil leaves, lime wedge and two veggie leaves (that I can't seem to identify) allows you go customize your broth and experience. Glad to have another pho place to recommend."}
{"text":"The wait line on winter is long but we were seated less in 30min and the waiter prepare high chair for our little one fast enough also the owner was nice but the food itself could do better. Ordered fried springroll and it was so oily looking, the chicken noodle soup alittle bit bland (was hoping the broth had strong chicken flavour but it wasn't) without hot sauce and the brown sauce have to mix everything to make it good. But my partner love his beef noodle soup which i think everyone is ordered."}
{"text":"WOW! YES! Coming from New York with no good pho on Manhattan, this place really hit the spot.  Really happy I made it here.  Just what I needed on a cold day in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious soup! Came here because levi bent Lee and susur bent Lee recommended. The soup was delicious and had wonderful flavour. The spring rolls were small wished they were larger. Facade was a little tacky with the pink walls but when food is amazing, who cares!"}
{"text":"Great pho!! The broth is flavourful and deep. Summer spring rolls are amazing as well. The staff could be a bit better but this place is always packed so you know the food is worthwhile. My favourite comfort food on the winter. The noodles are always cooked perfectly and the meat is tender and lean."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been my favorite spot for pho for years. So, today I went there with some friends and it was total disaster. I've noticed this restaurant is a bit up and down. Sometimes it tastes amazing, but sometimes it tastes just OK,  but still better than other pho restaurants in downtown. But, It was literally the worst pho I have ever had so far including instant ones. Its broth was really bland, no flavor at all. It was almost like a bowl of hot water with noodles and meat(meat was a lot less than the usual portion they normally serve)
I had to ask one of the servers to bring some salt, and told him about the broth and it seemed that he was aware of it.
Would've been an easy fix if the chef tasted the broth and put some efforts before serving. Very disappointed, may not go back to this restaurant anymore. Hopefully they see this review and taste the food before they serve."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho in Toronto! It's the pho place with the \"pink walls\". This is my go-to place when I crave for Pho. Has the best broth! (Although sometimes it's a hit & miss) But on the good days, the broth is so good! I usually get the spring rolls and the Vietnamese Coffee--the BEST!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Solid pho here. I am pretty picky when it comes to pho, but can you blame me? I get spoiled with my parents' homemade pho. 

However, this place is pretty legit. When you walk in, you can already smell the broth and that's usually a good sign. Would recommend if you're craving pho."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pho with rare and well done beef + beef brisket. Their broth is clear and light, yet still flavourful. I love the fact that the broth is not at all oily. Nothing to comment on beef as they are the usual beef you'd find anywhere. It would be good if they had the flat, wide pho noodle like in Vietnam (though i suspect it's only available in dry noodle packs). The place seems reasonably well kept to me."}
{"text":"Consistent, high-quality pho. And that broth! So, so good. I go pretty often and have noticed that peak times are 6-9pm, but they turn tables pretty fast. Service is efficient. Cash only."}
{"text":"I honestly let people tell me that the Golden Turtle is better and not correct them because I don't want anyone to find this Ossington gem. Amazing broth with a range of herbs , fantastic shakes, and very fast service even on busy days. Bathrooms are very clean too! I really do love Pho Forever."}
{"text":"Very good Pho. My husband and I have been searching for the best Pho in the city and so far this place is it. Delicious! A definite must try"}
{"text":"Lots of menu options. A dollar or two more expensive than other pho restaurants in Chinatown.  The broth that they use for the pho is pretty good.  I was however disappointed with the spring rolls.  They were good, but thin and long.  

The decor is pretty tacky (pink walls), but it adds to its homeyness. If you're slightly curious on how the decor is, the restaurant is featured in Majid Jordan's Small Talk music video. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"This is some solid pho. I really like their noodles.  I did prefer the pho ga to golden turtle however the deep fried spring rolls weren't as good. Still delicious nonetheless. They were generous with the bean sprouts but not so much on the chicken! Service was efficient and polite. Cash only. Place was looking a little dingy as well, although it adds somewhat to the charm and I really am there just for my soup !"}
{"text":"Fantastic little joint. Definitely the best Pho I have tried so far in Toronto, even better than the ones served at Anh Dao and Pho Hung (both in Chinatown).

Ordered a rare beef with brisket and tendon. Was given SO MUCH MEAT, and most importantly their beef tastes fresh. Somehow the texture of their noodle really stood out to me, it was a lot \"silkier\" than the pho noodles I have tried at other joints. Their herbs and bean sprouts plate was also outstanding. Was given more than just the thai basil variety, and the sprouts were extremely fresh.

It was also my first time trying avocado shake. I have no other comparison but it tasted amazing.

The service is simple and friendly. Order, get your food in under 3 minuts, they let you enjoy your pho undisturbed, and pay when you are ready."}
{"text":"The good: I think I found ... imo... the best pho in Toronto! Ah the soup, the noodles, and the appetizer were just amazing! First the pho, the soup was flavourful and best of all I didn't get super thirsty after (no msg indication? Sorry didn't look into whether they have msg or not in their soup, my guess is no). The noodles had the right texture, honestly I regret not getting a bigger pho size... not that I can stomach it...  the meet imo was just OK, not the best I've had with pho but still great with the overall dish. And finally the appetizer, I really recommend everyone to try their Vietnamese style spring rolls (pictured on the bottom left), so sooo good. The iced coffee wasn't bad too! (Super strong)

The bad: that I didn't have a second stomach for another pho bowl.

The ugly: nothing too ugly here

Neutral: lots of space here, so good for big groups or small groups. One of the bigger debates with this pho restaurant is whether this place is better than golden turtle (it's a block away), I honestly like this place better but it's apples and oranges, but are good - just depends on the eaters preference. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here after reading the reviews. Huge let down. 

Walked in on a Friday evening, had to wait to be seated which was totally fine. In the mean time, I decided to go downstairs to use the bathroom. Bathroom was very small but that was understandable because it's downtown; however, it was covered in bugs and spiders and smelled horrible like chemical, bleach and a dirty jay cloth. In the corner was a dirty sponge and mop water. I walked back upstairs and told my friend it was one of the most disgusting bathrooms but I'll give them a pass because bugs come out during the summer so whatever. We got seated as they were wiping down the table and we sat at a wet table where they threw the menus on top making them wet and sticky as well. It took us a few attempts to flag down a waiter as he kept walking by. Finally placed our order and when the food came it smelled. I had the shrimp and veggies on soft noodles, my friend had the beef noodle pho and we each got a shrimp spring roll. I think the shrimp in the spring roll was bad. I tasted something grainy as I chewed the veg, could only down two pieces of shrimp and we sat for 5 minutes took less than 5 bites, paid and walked out. We out a lot so we weren't upset because we've gone to other places and hadn't had a good experience but we still respect small businesses and know that with food you can't call it good or bad because everyone's palette is different. We chalked it up to the fact that we just weren't Vietnamese food people. Then about an hour later our stomachs were in knots and we had horrible cramping. For the next few days it didn't stop, we were nauseous, throwing up and .... using the bathroom A LOT. I couldn't keep anything down without a horrible stomach ache to follow. It's 3 days later and I'm still not better. This is my first review and I don't want to deter anyone from going but please please please If your food smells funky then don't eat it. Chances are, it's funky."}
{"text":"Most definitely my favourite pho place in Toronto. I might be biased since I've been eating here for almost two decades. The staff are very friendly, and food quality is always consistently food. Atmosphere and setup really reminds me of a typical restaurant in Vietnam, though that could be said about many restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Eh, I'm stubborn when it comes to Pho. I like my broth tasty and innovative, I like my noodles relatively wide (usually restaurants won't fulfill this) and chewy, and I like it piping hot. Unfortunately only 1.5 of the 3 requirements were filled in this restaurant, supposedly deemed one of the best in Toronto.

I ordered the Pho Tai Nam Sach, which consisted of rare beef, slightly fatty beef, and tripe. The slightly fatty beef and tripe were both good, however the rare beef was bunched together and was too thick and tough to eat. The pho was chewy, but was the narrow kind. The broth was very hot, but the taste wasn't anything too special, that is, simply standard beef broth. 

Overall it is a decent bowl of pho for a frigid winter day, but I will definitely not go out of my way to visit here on a normal day. Perhaps I would give Golden Turtle a try next time...

Service was very good for a Vietnamese restaurant, so I'll give them credit for that."}
{"text":"The pho tastes good! I ordered classic 09 pho and it's better than wherever i ate pho. The price is reasonable. I like here."}
{"text":"I'm reading all the reviews from other frustrated patrons. It's unfortunate that this place has become so busy that they can't keep keep everyone happy. Yeah it's a hole in the wall, but it's still the best pho place I've found since living in the GTA. If we're ever in the area this is our go to place for great food and great service. I've never come across a time when they weren't super friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night and it was PACKED. My company and I both ordered pho... rare beef and beef balls. The broth is tasty but you can tell there's quite a bit of msg in it.. but it does taste really really good. They give you plenty of bean sprouts and herbs. A large runs for $8 which is a little more expensive than other pho joints considering their large is more of a medium.

Service is quick - owners sons are friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I decided that we wanted Vietnamese food so we tried this place. It's an okay restaurant, I had a lot more expectations for this place since it was recommended to us by a couple of people around the neighborhood. The restaurant is extremely small, tight, and dirty. Aside from that, the food was good. Pho was nothing special, it was just enough to fill us all up. Their hoisin sauce was really watery... Now that I think about it, it shouldn't have been THAT watery. Cheap and friendly service. They also don't accept credit cards but they do have an ATM in their restaurant so no worries. Overall, it's not as bad but it's not as good either."}
{"text":"So, everyone says this is the Pho place to go to.  Sure you have that other one one block north, right at the bus stop, but this is where people say you should eat.

It's definitely better than the other one near by, because they don't rush you out, there's plenty of room to stretch out and not feel cramped.  It's a temperature that doesn't make you sweat more than the soup itself.

The large bowl isn't as large as I'd have liked, nor is the price as good as some other places.  But I didn't regret my decision to come here, and at the end of the day, when trying a new place - that's about as much as I could ask for."}
{"text":"In love with their pho ve don. Probably the best ve don I've had in Toronto. So fatty but so much flavour ."}
{"text":"So after writing that review, I continued to go to Pho Tien Thanh.  Needless to say, my opinion DEFINITELY changed. 

I love that place and miss it dearly. 

My rare beef pho was always actually RARE and in good quantity.  The flavor of my pho broth was always so insanely satisfying, fresh, and the ultimate cure-all for any sort of cold.  

I was always satisfied with the fresh rolls, and I miss the coconut milkshakes.  

Having moved from Toronto, I've got to say, my Vietnamese food life isn't the same without it."}
{"text":"Although their spring and fresh rolls are absolutely awesome, their service is terrible. The main dish was not even that big, I'm used to ask for one and share it with my husband, this one was mostly rice. 

Terrible. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good Pho can be tough for a vegetarian to find. I have avoided it lately after a few bad experiences with essentially tasteless slimy vegetables on rice or noodles. But my bf loves Pho so I asked Yelp to help me out and found so many good reviews on Pho Tien Thanh that we decided to give it a try. 

The over-lit, lame decor aside, the food was pretty good. I had summer rolls and vegetable and tofu stirfry with vermicelli noodles. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, not too soft, and the sauce had decent flavour. I happily put Hoisin sauce on anything and this was no exception, I added some chilis and had a decent meal. The summer rolls were good too - the rice paper was a little sticky - having made my own a number of times I feel qualified to comment on such a small thing :-) The sauce was delicious - more Hoisin, with fresh peanuts and shaved carrots.

My bf and had pork spring rolls on vermicelli which he says was alright but the rice noodles were a bit soggy - something I would agree the same about my stirfry noodles - then he had the meat special Pho - beef ball, tripe, beef bone, raw beef - lots of beef - he only had the small bowl and it was pretty huge. A decent amount of meat and he ate the broth but the noodles remained uneaten again. 

The servers were nice - including the boundless energy of the man mentioned in other reviews and of course you can't beat the price when you eat Pho. It was what my bf was craving this New Year's Day and it didn't disappoint. I'd eat here again when the craving strikes him next. 

In case you missed it in other reviews - CASH ONLY. Thankfully we saw that before we went! Thanks fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Simply the best pho in the city. The broth is so well done with fresh bean sprouts and generous portions of meat. The decor is a bit hokey,  but the food will win you over. This place is often packed, but worth it."}
{"text":"This is what my perfect pho heaven looks and tastes like. I can only describe the \"decor\" as random Miami Art Deco. The walls have several shades of pastel and there's an ode of Bruce Lee painting on the side wall. Every single time I've been here, I've gotten pho...it is in the name of the restaurant. My usual is pho dac biet, rare eye round steak, flank, brisket, soft tendon & tripe. The tripe is tender and delicious. The tendon is soft and luscious. These two combined with all the savoury and light broth and all the other beef in the bowl is my idea of heaven (yes, that's heaven twice in one review). This also keeps me from trying any of the other dishes on the menu because I just know this pho is going to be a hit, but if it's any indiction...I have it feeling everything else will be just as addictive."}
{"text":"It took 30 seconds to be seated and served tea, our server showed up exactly as we closed the menus, and the pho we ordered was brought out swiftly. It's worth mentioning this was the case for everyone in there on a relatively busy Thursday night. 

We had pho w/ rare beef and brisket. It was the perfect temp, had a rich broth, came with super fresh sprouts, basil, etc. and the most tender beef I've had in a pho before. 

Sidebars: a homeless man was allowed to come in and warm up in the doorway, which made me feel good about giving this place my business. Washrooms are not accessible, so there's room for improvement there. 

This is a great pho spot that we walked right past a lineup into Golden Turtle to get to. I'd do it again."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the broth for the veggie pho isn't vegan. The staff might tell you it is vegetable broth, but it aggravated my friend who has a creatine allergy (meat). The food is delicious and the place smells amazing from the second that you walk in the door. I just wish they used veggie bouillon for the tofu pho."}
{"text":"Pho Tien Thanh, a slightly worn down Viet restaurant on Ossington. You will fit in with the \"crowds\" here more if you were in yoga pants and a sweatshirt, versus something nice. Very relaxed atmosphere that gives you a neighbourhood feeling. 

Service was nothing exceptional, they take your order, bring you your food, and then get the bill for you. The pho is average and the portions are decent. I always hope for a surprising amount of beef, which is more than a few slices, but I have yet to look for a place that can surprise me.

P.S. they have Chinese beer, if you're up for a bottle of ??"}
{"text":"3 words. BEST. PHO. EVERRR!! My number 1 place for pho in Toronto. I had their rare beef pho. It was THE bomb. The broth was light, not too oily or salty and was full of flavor. This place doesn't drown their soup in msg like many other pho places do. The noodles were perfectly cooked and soaked all the essence of the broth. The meat was good too! Generous portion of meat and wasn't overcooked. The price is good considering the quantity and quality. Worth every penny $$. Don't really have much else to say, all I can say is that if you haven't tried pho here then...you are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"3.5

This place has it all when it comes to casting.  The obligatory hard-working teenage son of the owners.  An old man in the kitchen (visible) whose only purpose seems to be to languidly stir the contents of a large pot once in a while.  And a totally fabulous waiter who looks like he got unhappily lost on his life's quest to visit every dance music night club from Kowloon to Rangoon.

The food was quite fine, but not extraordinary, I suspect, for Toronto.  The catfish in the canh chua was cooked really well.  Flaky fish and fatty fat.  The okra, on the other hand, appeared to have been slowly cooked since 1961,  This is hard to avoid when it comes to okra.  But this deficiency is avoidable, and therefore results in a lower rating"}
{"text":"The pho broth was very flavorful and clear. The tendon was soft and tasty, unlike some other places where they give you hard discs of tendon. Was very packed on new years day, and had to wait about 15 mins. They don't take your names down, you just kinda wait awkwardly wondering if you'll get a table or if someone else will try to snake your table away from you."}
{"text":"This Pho restaurant was located on a street that doesn't quite look too appealing.  The restaurant/house gave me a very homeland feel.  The vibe and decor looks and feels just like Vietnam.  The Pho broth was very tasty but unfortunately the beef was chewy.  We're spoiled with the beef here in Alberta.  I tried a piece of my friends pork chop rice and it was amazing.  It had a little fat along with it which makes it just melt in your mouth.  I ordered the jumbo shrimp rice.  It had a kick to it so was different than the way I always have it.  It was just mediocre for me.  

We came back a second time and ordered the Sour soup and claypot fish.  The soup was very flavorful and the fish tasted fresh; not like those frozen fish that most restaurants serve.  

It's not easy finding a good restaurant in TO because there's just too many, so we couldn't give up the opportunity to come back.

The service though was extremely slow and prices are quite high for a vietnamese restaurant.  The plating was also disappointing because the plate they used was so small that the meat covered the entire plate; that made it difficult to eat.    But overall, two thumbs up and definately could be a regular restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Its best for take out. As its usually full and there isn't too much space. I suppose this is normal for the Pho industry though. 

We had the Pho rare beef (no tripe) and it was pretty tasty. The ratio of beef to broth to sprouts and vermicelli was good. (usually there isn't enough broth or there is toooooo much...this place seemed to have it down nicely. The leftovers also kept. I've ordered from other places where once you leave the noodles in the broth over night or in the fridge they expand and soak up the broth and then you get this overly gelatinous noodle stew. The next day it was still Pho-esque. 

The spring rolls were a little heavy on the grease but still good. I believe they have meat in them, so be sure to request veggie if that is an issue."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho in Toronto, best broth ever. My only complaint is that it's super packed sometimes.

Tip: You can get the tea cold, with ice in it. Great to drink along with a big hot bowl of pho in the summer."}
{"text":"Hands Down best Pho I've ever had. The broth really is amazing and I've eaten a lot of pho. The portions are great and well priced. The spring rolls were also amazing and crispy - a little smaller than the typical size but enjoyed every bite. We also liked the porkchops w/ broken rice but hands down the soup and the spring rolls are the winners on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve with a friend since we were hangry, decided on some Phuken Pho.
The place is kind of jive in jive out. Chairs and tables need a good updating, while the decors do need a bit of an updating, except for my homie Bruce Lee.

Some of the siracha and hoisin sauce are kind of watery the last time I went. 
The soup that came with my order kind of had a bit more msg than I wanted, compare to many years ago I came by for Pho. 

My only grief is why only cash only and not be able to accept debit or cc if you are a registered establishment.

Overall, I only come here when I have the Pho-cravings and in the area."}
{"text":"The hype is worth it. They do have excellent pho broth. For sure, it's one of the few good ones in Toronto."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I couldn't make the official Pho-bruary kick-off UYE at Pho Tien Thanh.  I wanted to try Pho Tien Thanh so I decided to recruit a couple of my siblings for a UYE of our own. This was my first experience with pho and I must say it was fan-pho-cking-tastic.

We started with the vegetarian spring rolls, beef jerk and papaya, and shrimp roll on sugar cane. The spring rolls were awesome, not overly greasy and much better than most Chinese style spring rolls I've had. The beef jerky dish was also tasty, the jerky had a great texture and the sauce was great. The \"papaya\" looked suspiciously like carrot to me but it tasted great so whatever. I'd pass on the shrimp roll next time, it was a little bland for my taste.

I ordered a medium special beef pho, which came with tripe, tendon, brisket, and rare beef. The rare beef comes raw and you cook it when the bowl arrives by submerging it in the broth. The medium was huge and there was a ton of delicious, tender meat in my soup. The soup is served with fresh bean sprouts, basil, and limes on the side and the broth benefited from the addition of these. For what it's worth, after finishing the meat in my pho I didn't finish the broth; I was really full by this point and the broth alone didn't blow me away.

For 3 soups and 3 apps our bill came in at under $40. For the amount and quality of food it was super cheap.

While the food at Pho Tien Thanh was a 4, the service was easily a 5. Everyone we interacted with had a huge smile on their face and our waiter was quick, friendly, and unbelievably helpful. I think he could tell right away we were new to the pho scene by the puzzled look on our faces when the bean sprouts and basil arrived. He walked us through a Pho101 class, showing us what to do with the sprouts and basil and how to mix the various sauces on the table just right. Every so often he'd check in on us whiteys to see if we needed any help."}
{"text":"Love love love! The broth for the pho here is consistently good, never too bland or salty like some other places. I usually order pho with rare beef and beef ball, spring rolls and a coconut or avocado shake."}
{"text":"Best pho place in Toronto! Definitely better than Golden turtle up the street.  I've been coming here since 2003 and now I can see its becoming more busy than ever before.  Which as a result I see some interesting reviews from first timers lol.  If you go to a pho place, order the pho not the thai food! Also all pho places you self order and write it down on a slip.  It's just the way its done, there's nothing scary with that. 
The pho is one of the more tasty broths I've had as well.  I recommend for everyone as their first pho experience and their main go-to for pho as well!"}
{"text":"Your standard hole-in-the-wall Pho joint with gaudy pink 70's Vietnamese decor. We each got a bowl of Pho, and also got some salad rolls and spring rolls. Everything was middle-of-the-road, exactly what you'd expect, except that while most Pho places serve Jalapeno as garnish, this place used red chili peppers instead."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a clean spot to eat pho this would not be the place for you. But if you're willing to accommodate with the fact this place got a conditional pass and you would really like to eat some good pho then go try this place out. The broth is delicious and the portions for meat is just right. The spring rolls are also amazing. The only downside of this place is that even if you set the table yourself, make sure you wipe the chopsticks and spoons before you use them because the chopsticks touch the wall. I went to the washroom and there were 5 insects flying in my stall which was a terrible experience. But I just make sure I bring hand sanitizer whenever I go here because I would mission all the way dt just to get another bowl of their yummy noodles. Customer service is amazing and they don't give attitude when asking for a glass of water. I find the seating very comfortable and even if it gets noisy in this restaurant it's not irritating. I just wish they would clean this place up a bit more."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Pho places I've been in the city. The noodles are well-portioned, not too thick and the broth is tasty and has lots of depth and complexity. Delivers on a value standpoint, the only thing I found a little disappointing was the spring rolls. Generally I find Vietnamese spring rolls to be super-satisfying and generous. These guys were a little skimpy and fell short for me."}
{"text":"Great pho! The beef soup base is amazing. Likely the best pho I had in Toronto. Ordered the soda eggnog out of curiosity and was surprisingly good! Fried spring roll is different from any other vietnamse restaurants I've been to. I secretly suspect the spring roll we had here is the true form of vietnamse spring roll. :) highly recommended pho place."}
{"text":"Pho is okay its nothing special, Bbq pork and fried egg rice is good but the durian milkshake is AMAZING!!

It's cash only so bring cash. Or not. Theres an atm at the door. Please accept credit card soon i really dont like having cash on me"}
{"text":"Best pho place downtown. The soup is hot and noodles and meat are fair portions. Beware of long lines during weekends, especially during lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"One would think pho is a quick meal from countless experiences, but here it is by far the slowest pho restaurant I've ever been too. I didn't realize it would take over half an hour for me to get my beef ball noodle soup and pho special. The sad part is, it wasn't even busy.

The price is  a bit more than what you would get at other pho places, and the portions are on average what you would usually get downtown. I guess I'm used to bigger portions for a small/cheaper prices/and amazing taste uptown than downtown. 

The pho is decent and gives you that fix you need. However, the deep fried spring rolls are so tiny, I could eat the 2 skinny rolls in one bite. They're not even a decent sized roll... literally the size of 2 chopsticks. Even if it tastes decent, it's no where near worth the price it's for! I've also had the pork/shrimp rice paper roll -- one would think it would be paired off with that delicious peanut sauce, but instead they give you watered down hoisin sauce and peanuts just sprinkled on. I would have forgave the sauce itself but watered down... really?

Trust me when I say this, you can do so much better with pho than here. Go to Chinatown and you won't have watered down hoisin and chilli sauce. Or springrolls you can floss with."}
{"text":"Great pho with a delicious broth. More pricy than some places in Chinatown but not a deal breaker at all. 

I got the medium which was already huge and more than enough broth personally. Their smoothies are also great! Avocado is my go to, but I tried the jackfruit here which was also tasty but sweeter compared to the avocado smoothie. 

It's a bit out of the way for me in the winter to trek here from downtown but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ended up going here today after all this talk of Pho-Bruary and I must say, that I like it so much more than Golden Turtle. 

I got the rare beef pho and some spring rolls and both were delicious. Bad broth is a major deal breaker for me whenever I eat pho and the broth here did not disappoint. The beef was thinly sliced and the noodles were spot on as well. Also, the spring rolls were super crispy without being super oily and I kinda wish I had some here right now to snack on.

Overall, a tasty meal at a great price. It's good to know there's a pho place I can visit without having to venture too far from home."}
{"text":"Gangster Pho ... love this place. Decor hasn't changed since it probably opened, and for good reason - it doesn't need to. Pho is probably top 3 in the city...and definitely edges the shop up the street. 

Broth is clean and flavourful.. with plenty of basil and bean sprouts on the side. Noodles are in good portion too. Bun Bo Hue is also good.. and if your adventurous, try it with the pork blood. 

Safe picks are always the vermicelli bbq bowl, packed with grilled meats and fresh herbs. 

DT gives it two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I don't know Pho a lot, but I know what's a good broth and what's good noodle. I also know that, this is mainly the dish! So by definition even though I don't know Pho, I know it quite well, and let me tell you that this is an amazing soup! A cure for something, it makes you feel better, stronger, and killed most germ inside you, if you're into spice like myself. I was waiting and waiting for my friends to arrive. Late they were, unless, In advance i was! Doesn't matter, Drank a Tiger beer and ordered some fried beef rolls.Honnestly I was clueless most of the time I was eating my meal. I went with some Pho and vietnamese food expert and good some good advice. I even tried the Duran Smooties which provided me good amount of energy and was pretty good. The waiter was energetic, fast and really funny. He was looking at me, and compare to the average Vietnamese, I'm enormous and the amount of food I could ingest made my waiter ask with a concerned smile: Are you sure!? ahahahaha

Ohh CASH ONLY by the way, to come equiped."}
{"text":"went here on a sunday afternoon for lunch with friends. we ordered 2 phos, a grilled pork chop (which i had), and spring rolls. the spring rolls were so fresh...their shapes were a bit different from what I'm used to. these were lean snd long..think churros but the crunch factor was on point. i tried my friend's pho and the broth was full of flavours and savoury. my food came with 2 servings of porkchop which was more than enough. fresh grill marks, smokey lemongrass flavour. very delicious! way better than golden turtle"}
{"text":"This is a hole-in the wall restaurant as other reviewers have noted. Honestly I feel like those are the best places to get pho- in Vietnam people literally have pho for breakfast on the side of the street. 

I got a large bowl (I think of the special but with no tripe!) and it came out almost 5 minutes after, stuffed to the brim with meat and broth. The broth was amazing and the cuts of meat felt so authentic, especially with the rare beef actually being rare. I think my favourite part is the herbs that they serve it with. There's basil and bean sprouts along with another herb that my parents use a lot at home but I'm unsure of the name in English (that's when you know it's legit!!). 

Honestly for how small and dingey the place is the service is really great, they're attentive and efficient. It is a cash only establishment though, so come prepared!"}
{"text":"Came back here for the second time and I thought I should write them a good review. Place was packed when I came both times and the wait time wasn't so bad. I personally thought that their portion size were reasonable; just as described in the menu. You just gotta come and check out this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is easily the best vietnamese place in Toronto! Everything here is so yummy. My favourites are the deep fried spring roll and Bun Bo Hue which is pho with a spicy broth. 

The service is always quick and friendly, even though a lot of people come by here I never had to wait for a table. Also a good place for take out, just call 15 minutes ahead and it's ready to go!"}
{"text":"I have visited many pho establishments and I have to say this was my worst experience. As soon as we walked into the restaurant we visited the loo which was absolutely disgusting. The men's washroom had a fly trap with dead insects stuck to it. The women's washroom had spider webs and dead insects in the cracks of the doors. 
We decided to ignore the warning and stay because of the great reviews on yelp. The prices for the pho are a bit higher than usual, my go to place Vietnam Noodle Star charges only $6.00 for a small bowl where as this place charges around $8-9. The quantities are tiny!!!!! The noodles didn't even fill half my bowl, and the sparse pieces of meat I got were overdone. To top that off their hoison sauce was watery and something was off about it. We also ordered some shrimp salad rolls where were nothing to write home about. The shrimp had a funky smell and the feces hadn't been removed. 
In the end we just wanted to pay and leave but then we were told they only accepted cash so we had to pay extra to withdraw cash. 
Complete cap and waste of money. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Pho is great here! Ordered a medium-sized special pho as a second dinner to share after Montgomery's. 

Warning. The meat balls ordered on the side is not the same as regular pho meatballs. They are charred sausages. 

But the server will maintain eye contact with conviction and confidence when responding \"yes\" to the much needed question of: is this the meatball? 

Attached picture as proof of troll-level."}
{"text":"I gave a second try but left as disappointed as before. 2.8

Really a place for white urban ecologist new-age people (almost only local white guys there wearing kaki clothes and green-straw-made tuks, talking about books on revolutions and how to stop the Earth warming threat), who do not know much about a real good pho and vietnamese food. Cha gio remain OK, however, but for a white palate, to be honest. 

Pho remains bland, with MSG (yes! like almost anywhere else, so stop pretending this place does not use it!); meat is not well cut, too chewy. Hoisin sauce is diluted in water! Tea is not good.

I just had no problem with the waiters...

+ weird to see a pho place in toronto offering take away pho!!"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and the servers were horrendous. I got in the line around 2:30 pm on Saturday and be seated after 10 minutes or so. When I told them I was by myself, I got strange vibe from the server, but I decided to ignore it, thinking I was overly sensitive. 

The server didn't clean the table enough before seated me, so I cleared some lettuce from it. Fine, I told to myself, at least the food is good here, that's all matter. Then the server never came to my table to bring tea/water or collect the order slip. OK, I decided to take it easy and left the order on the table and went to the washroom, hoping they would come to collect my order before I came back to the table. A BIG MISTAKE. When I came back, I found new customers were seated at my table, already got their tea of course. My coat I left at my chair was moved. The order slip I left at the table was given to the new customers, my order was crossed out. 

Wow! I endured many poor services in Toronto so far, yet this is the new low!! I explained to the nice, innocent couple who were happened to be seated there what has just happened. We (customers!) apologized with each other, and the server moved the couple to another table (The restaurant wasn't packed - the line was created due to either inefficiency or advertising gimmick!). No apology from the server. Why would they? It's foolish to expect that from them. I felt the air of the restaurant just got frozen around me. I was sure some kind diners were feeling sorry about this poor Asian woman (me!). The server still didn't come to collect my order or bring tea for good 5 minutes so I started reading a book. I am sure no one wants to be treated like I was that day, under any circumstances. 

The food came to my table eventually, and I ate the soup. The restaurant went back to normal as if nothing had happened. It probably was nothing, except for me. The restaurant will continue to be popular and people who run this establishment would keep picking on solo female diner occasionally. When I paid my soup, I communicated the lady at the cashier my disappointment. I didn't pay the tip (Why would I?) And I leave this negative comment for the community to see. After all, the business only can be as good as the people who run it."}
{"text":"Lemongrass soup with shrimp and pork (made mine spicy) with vermicelli-- warning I thought vermicelli was THIN NOODLE no problem really just wish the menu had specified there are apparently two sizes vermicelli. Tasty broth, fatty pork but I'm sure that helps the flavour. Not as many fixings on the side as some places but did the trick."}
{"text":"Spicy Pho with crabs...say what??? Okay I was deeply intrigued and quite excited having learned that my favourite soup noodle dish had married my favourite food grouping while having an affair with my favourite edible compound: Pho + seafood + capsaicin (makes things spicy). What could possibly go wrong? (tomatoes, btw, but i digress). With the promise of experiencing the saliva-inducing threesome, I was lured by my friends to the ossington strip that i admittedly isn't a huge fan of, to taste the wonder. 

As soon as you walk into to Pho Tien Thanh (which sounds like pho heaven in chinese when sounding it out loud, but actually does not mean that in vietnamese), you are encased by the aroma of awesome vietnamese food. So here's a tip: don't bring anything inside that you don't want to smell like awesome deliciousness for weeks to come.

To be honest, the spicy crab pho isn't worthy of special trip to the area, but it was really good. It was tomato-based (it's very rare for me to like anything tomato-based) and in a huge proportion. Each bowl not only have giant prawns, but also a crab bodypart, pigs blood, pig's feet, and tofu. You can ask for it to be served without any of the ingredients mentioned above by writing it in the order form. I opted out of the pigs blood, and i probably should have done the same with the pig's feet, because the feet was dry and skinny and tasted funky. The fragrant soup tasted a bit like tomyum. The noodles are round instead of flat, but i'm pretty sure you can also ask for the flat noodles. 

The spring rolls are not worth ordering. They are super tiny and comes with a few tiny leaves of iceberg lettuce (that are not big enough to make a wrap with) and some vermicelli with a bowl of fish sauce. MEH.

The coconut milk shake, though expensive, is worth the $5 as you can taste the coconut flesh. 

**EDIT** I came back again a few days later and tried their regular pho with rare and fatty beef and their broken rice with chicken, beef, and porkchop. The pho was great, but the rice was not. The meats were extremely small, dry, and jerky. Only the chicken was a bit acceptable. I would just stick to the pho.

CASH only"}
{"text":"This is my fav Vietnamese restaurant in the gta the deep fried spring rolls are the best and the pho is really good also."}
{"text":"Noodle soup tasted very close to what I tried in Vietnam. Well thought of everything. They provide small bowls for dipping sauce. I asked them for more condensed milk for the coffee they actually mixed it with hot water so I can mix it easier. Few kinds of spices on the side for the noodle soup. All of the staffs served friendly and politely. And their price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"After seeing so many high ratings about this place and personal recommendations from Levi and Kai Bent Lee in their vlogs( if you don't know who they are, they are the sons of Toronto's celebrity chef Susur Lee), my wife and I decided to give this Vietnamese restaurant a try after work.

We arrived at the restaurant at around 5:45 pm and the first thing we noticed was the outdated decor of the restaurant, but that's okay! As long as the food lives up to the hype and tastes delicious, that's all we really cared for.

We immediately placed our order.  I ordered a rice pork chop with a sunny sided egg and the wife ordered their house special pho.  We also got a side order of their crispy spring rolls.  The waiter took our order slip and went straight to the back for processing.  

When the food came, it looked good! But to our disappointment, it definitely didn't live up to the hype and here is why.  The grilled pork that came with my rice was small in portion and was chewy!  It didn't have that grilled and tender texture taste like in some other Vietnamese restaurants.  My wife's pho was medicore at most, nothing mind blowing.  The beef slices were a bit thick for her liking as well.  The spring rolls had some crunch but was too oily.  Oil was seeping out of the rollls with each bite.

Overall, food was medicore and nothing special.  My hunt for the best Vietnamese joint in Toronto continues..."}
{"text":"Again 4 stars because it was a bit on the salty side this day.  As usual a creature of habit: Number 14, small which is the Rare Beef and Tripe Pho--so good!  The rare occasion I actually finished my pho (without help).

Service was the same, not bad but also not spectacular.  Prompt and tea was available, can not complain.  At 10pm it was a full house packed with 20-40 year old hungry Torontonians on a cold devilish spring evening.

Two bowls of Pho, sized small and medium came up to $23 with tax and a generous tip.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went on 3pm on a Saturday and there was no wait. This has been the best place I've had pho in Toronto. I had the bun rieu and the fiancé had bun bo hue. We also tried the papaya salad which was also very good. Would I wait in line for this place? No. Would I come again? Yes. 
Staff were pretty friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a Vietnamese acquaintance, who said this is as close as it gets to pho back home. After trying it out myself, I concur. Best place in town (so far). I always forget that their broth is already well-seasoned it barely needs any Hoisin or Sriracha, unlike many pho places around. I would highly recommend their cha gio, rolled thin with extra crispy batter.. my mouth is watering as I type this. I've never tried their rice dishes so I can only speak for their pho, but friends have told me they are pretty good as well.
I've been to Pho Tien Thanh many times, and they have always been consistent flavour-wise. There are usually line ups no matter what time of the day I go. The only caveat to this place would be the lack of ventilation."}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend recommended this restaurant to me. She said \"this is the best Pho restaurant in Toronto, and you should try avocado smoothie and spring roll as well.\" So I tried! It was healthy and delicious! When I was trying these foods, one of staff recognized that I am Japanese, and he greeted us in Japanese. That made us happy too. Unfortunately I couldn't try avocado smoothie so I'll come back to have it someday!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite pho places in Toronto! If your looking for good Viet food minus the fancy interior this is the place to go!  The food is great and it's communal style just like Asia."}
{"text":"another gem on the ossington. this place is long and narrow so the waiters are all the way at the other end of the restaurant i suggest just helping yourself to an open table. my usual spot is golden turtle up the street but due to renos we came here instead. this place has always been rammed packed every time even at different times of the day. the pho broth is much more rich than golden turtle but not to the point where you need a bucket of water on the table. the service is friendly and food comes out in short time. food seemed very fresh one thing to note is the noodle portions are smaller than most places. A grown man may need to order the X large."}
{"text":"Feel a cold coming on? Want chicken noodle soup? Nonsense. Pho is where it's at. 

I confess: I'm not even going to pretend that I know anything about what good pho should taste like. Especially as a vegetarian. But my throat was sore, my nose was congested, and my head hurt, and all I wanted in life was a huge, steaming bowl of noodle soup. Thank goodness for Pho Tien Thanh's veggie pho. VEGGIE PHO!!!

Since the thought of leaving the house was almost unbearable, I ordered takeout and commissioned my boyfriend to pick up my food, so I can't comment on the interior of the restaurant, or the service. The pho came packaged in 3 separate containers: one for veg and noodles, one for broth, and one for sprouts, lime, chilis, etc. After combining everything in a giant bowl and dousing it all with a generous helping of sriracha, I proceeded to feast on the goodness of veggie pho. Despite my ignorance of traditional Vietnamese food, this was exactly what I needed - spicy, savoury and steamy. And after I had gorged myself, there was still enough left over to enjoy for lunch the next day!

My fellow veggies, I urge you to treat yourself to veggie pho when you feel a cold coming on. It will do you wonders."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho in downtown Toronto! This place never disappoints but it can get busy during the peak dining hours, whether it's for lunch or dinner, make sure you get there early to grab seats. Especially if it's for a bigger party, expect to wait for 20-30minutes because this place will be packed.  

My friends and family love coming to this place for their Vietnamese Iced Coffees and Pho, although the other items on their menus are just as good. And not to mention, their staff is extremely friendly even during busy peak hours. Definitely will not disappoint your taste buds!"}
{"text":"This is one of the two BEST pho places in Toronto. I am Chinese, to me noodle soup is kinda boring. Not until I was brought into it by having the worst flu in my life 3 years ago that I could not swallow, speak or laugh for good 2 months through out Dec to almost Feb, it was pho kept me alive. And since then once a while I hv unbearable pho cravings once a while that I need to get my pho fix.  So I have eaten pho around everywhere downtown Toronto. This place is the best one so far i have had. 

Their soups are tasty, their green toppings r fresh and they aren't cheap on basil n chilli pepper. Their noodles aren't soggy. Whenever I hv a sick day, this place is my for sure \"fix\" destination. 

If you happen to go there on lunch tme, try to go there before 12pm. There is a line up for seats. The place is that good!

I always order their special spicy soup. All their phos are great! Their grilled chicken/pork arent as good as other places though. Its not like they taste good. they sliced em so thin! You'd feel like eating deli meat slices not chicken chops. 

If you like pho,  you should try Tian. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Oh how I love ghetto places!!! Numbered out by Caucasians,  I was first iffy about the legitimacy of this place.  Is it just another pho 88 chained mediocre restaurant?  I guess that's the beauty of yelp and social media.  Once there's a good spot,  word gets out and it will no longer be a hidden gem. 

I find the most crucial factor when judging whether the bowl of yummy goodness is drool -  worthy is by tasting the soup.  It's flavourful yet not salty,  and it won't make you feel dehydrated after drinking the whole bowl.  

Although pho noodles are cheap eats,  this place will squeeze every penny out of you. They charge you 2. 50$ for beef if you want it rare in the side?!  Plus a small for 7$...  

Ladies bathroom stalls are listed with clever rhymes that entertained me while doing my #1 .. 
''here I sit broken hearted,  came to shit but only farted''"}
{"text":"Dropped by Pho Tien Thanh on a late Sunday afternoon. The place was half empty so I have great, friendly and attentive services.

I settled for a Medium rare beef with tripes Pho ($6.50) and an iced coffee($3.00).

Here compare to Golden Turtle the medium is a medium.. I don't need to order a large :)

The pho broth was ok, a little heavy on the MSG... I was so that evening already. The noodle was the dried type and though the beef was nice and tender but definitely no enough!

I really enjoyed the free iced cold Jasmine tea they serve!! I never have it in the other Pho places I have been! So nice and refreshing and it was iced cold!

The interior of the restaurant though dated, is roomy and you have tons of personal spaces!

2 star for the Pho
3 star for the iced Jasmine tea
3 star for the service"}
{"text":"This is the \"other\" pho place on Ossington. Its owner used to work at Golden Turtle with its current owner, now the two no longer speak, or something along those lines.

Who cares, really. All that matters is that this place is WAY better than Golden Turtle. Why?

1) Their food tastes better. Duh. The pho broth is divine, full of all the right kinds of spices and flavour, the meat is tender and fresh, the spring rolls are a weird shape but actually taste really good. In the pho topping plate, they include the typical basil, bean sprouts, chilis and limes, but they give you way more of everything (I can never have enough lime juice), and they bring you long strands of real coriander. Mmmm...

2) The staff rules. Your table will likely be served by Vietnamese teenagers/twentysomethings who wear Ecko t-shirts and Rocawear jeans and are probably the nicest kids I've ever met. Super attentive, and, might sound awful, but they are all obviously Canadian-born, so no language barriers! (Not the case at Golden Turtle)

3) Less busy than the over-hyped Golden Turtle! It can still be pretty busy in here, but for the most part, the restaurant is comfortably occupied.

4) CHEAPER THAN GOLDEN TURTLE. Every dish here is about $1 cheaper than at the northern competitor. Enough said."}
{"text":"Omg this place. Their pho is so delicious and food comes out so fast. When you only have an hour to stuff food in your face those two factors are very important. And did I mention cheap? Although they only take cash there is an atm by the door. The servers are all very polite and friendly. I love coming here and hopefully one day when I am not in a rush I can actually sit down and try other things off their menu."}
{"text":"You know those people who say, 'I want to go to one of those hole in the wall places where the food is really really good.......' Well, this is that place!!!! 
I have been quite the golden turtle fan for the longest time.... things have changed. Oh how things have changed. 
The broth here is just wonderful. The noodles are prefect. Unlike a lot of other places, they got us more of the greens without the dollar fifty addition to the bill. The food came quickly and the side plate of sprouts and Vietnamese greens were fresh. I always ask for more lime and basil and the server brought it to us right away. 
It absolutely is a hole in the wall so no fancy dining here. 
If you just really LOVE good pho, go here, you really won't regret it."}
{"text":"Also tried paying in USD as another poster in here.  They played the same trick and tried to overcharge me."}
{"text":"I love this place I never had a bad meal would recommend it to anyone.  It is always busy but worth the wait. Cash only. I recommend the pho beef and adding veggies to it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.

I live on the other side of the city but I'll always make time for a bowl of pho whether its dine in or take out, their broth is ALWAYS hot and fresh.

Service is better...or should i say way better than other franchises like peach garden and train. \" Right this way my friend.. \"  for the regulars I'm sure you know who I'm talking about.

With its popularity, I try to avoid going during rush hour otherwise expect to wait outside the door which is the only negative I can think of. Otherwise Pho thanh serves one of the best if not the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Since I'm in the area a *lot* because of Bang Bang, I thought it might be nice to check out one of the many restaurants along the Ossington strip.

We walked into Pho Tien Tranh and it was surprisingly busy. Everything looked and smelled great, so I was excited to sample some of their offerings.

We started with the Fried Wonton and Deep Fried Spring Roll. I'll admit that neither of these dishes set an especially promising tone for the meal. The very small and thin Spring Roll was crunchy and tasteless, while the Fried Wonton, which fared a little better, was pretty one-note in terms of flavor.

For my main, I went with the Chicken Pad Thai. I've had many, many variations of this dish, and this was neither one of the best nor one of the worst. It was just there, overly greasy and lacking in bold flavors. I'd also requested it very spicy and it came with barely a modicum of heat.

There's another Thai restaurant near Pho Tien Tranh and one can only hope it's a little bit better."}
{"text":"As someone who was raised on pho, I have to say the pho here is delicious and always hits the spot on a cold Toronto day. I usually get the Pho Tai Bo Vien (rare beef & beef ball pho) or Pho Dac Biet (special pho, read: smorgasbord of toppings). It comes out in a steaming bowl and stays hot until my last slurp of soup.

Their interior is EXTREMELY OUTDATED and in dire dire dire need of a facelift. Luckily they're located in a neighbourhood that favours food over decor but it is still no excuse for the 70's/80's theme they've got going on. I'm going to make a wild conclusion that they are either 1. superstitious 2. cheap 3. lazy or 4. combination of the forementioned. (-1 star)

Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho I've ever had... The restaurant itself is less than lovely, kind of dingy, but deserves five stars based on the food. The rare beef was unreal. Piping hot and sooooooo good. They bring lots of veg and herbs along side the pho, and will happily bring more. It's cash only, but it's quick and the service is good. Definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bowl of their house special beef pho after my massage appointment earlier tonite. Heard about this place but never been. Got there at around 6:30. It was full. I can see why. The pho is solid. The beef broth itself is, well... beefy. And the beef slices were cooked right.

I'll be going back next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past a year or two and have to say this is my fav place to go in Toronto for Pho.  It's authentic, it's simple and it doesn't try to be anything else.  I use to go to Golden Turtle in the late 2000's but they have dropped in quality and service for a quite some time.

My girlfriend has loved this place from the get go and as usual, she's usually right.  We stick to the pho here and order either just the rare beef pho or rare and well done beef pho.  The noodle are better than most of the pho places and the broth is flavourful but not MSG filled like so many others.  It hits the spot every time.

We do have to say, the vermicelli is around a 3-3.5/5 and the spring rolls, 2/5 but if you're craving pho, then this is the place.  It won't let you down."}
{"text":"Not the top pho, but it gets the job done in the neighbourhood.  Their meat is never great, just average (not foul or anything). I would say they are using good quality ingredients, just not doing what I an used to with them.  Broth/noodles/everything else is on par.

What I don't get is, why everyone raves about Golden Turtle up the street.  Pho Tien Thanh is definitely better.  I suspect people are scared off by the super-old-fashioned atmosphere in there, I for one found it charming.  Or maybe it's just two different styles of cooking, and more people like the other one better.  Try them both a few times before you start clicking lots of stars, or if you're just going once, may as well flip a coin."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST Pho places. I am sorry to see that at one pint they had a conditional pass. I only started going to \"TienThanh\" this past summer. I was introduced to it by a friend. The service is as you would expect , friendly, fast and appreciative for the business. Regardless of what day of the week it is ALWAYS busy with no more than 1 to 3 tables available at a time. You go there for good , favorable, piping HOT ( as it should be served and as I am told by a Vietnamese friend is the mark of a true and good Pho, that it is served piping HOT) generous portions  and the meat in the soups seems a better quality than what is usually offered with Pho. 
  Do not expect romantic or impressive decor or ambiance. I like that the tables have what you need , Sauces, chop sticks, napkins so you will not need to be held up from enjoying this beautiful piping hot bowl of joy inducing comforting goodness by waiting on condiments . You are give an order sheet and mark down your self what you want, size and quantity . 
Rare beef Pho
Chicken Pho
Shrimp& Pork Cold rolls served with peanut sauce  ( I like to add a little of the chili sauce to this and get an extra order to take home that never makes it home ) 
Prices are cheerful and manageable
Cash only BUT they do have a bank machine inside
Both the chicken Broth and Beef Broth are beautiful , you can taste the array of seasoning in the broth, It smells and tastes like it  is created with tradition and love. 
Definitely recommend this place . On my last visit it was a beautiful day and our intention was to walk part of the way and wound up walking the entire distance from my home that turned out to be a 13 miles walk. I can now say I walked across the city for this Pho or walked almost the distance of a half marathon . It was worht it and I would do it again without hesitation or debate."}
{"text":"Great bbq beef and chicken vermicelli.  Very good quality beef. Not as many veggies on it as I'd like but now Is my #1 place to go for this dish."}
{"text":"In my initial review, I got a little confused with my Pho places. It's not that I reviewed the wrong place, it's that I blended the beautiful, cheap Phos of Ossington together. 

Pho Tien Thanh does not have the wonderful patio that Golden Turtle has and it's cash only. However, those things don't deter my return, as Vietnamese friends tend to agree this joint is the more traditional Pho place, and I never go wrong with their fried spring rolls (apparently not traditional) and their beautiful Pho Ga (very traditional). 

They're open for lunch and dinner, and get you in and out in a timely manner. Pho Tien are my friends."}
{"text":"So happy to have this restaurant in my hood, always nice to have a great Pho restaurant near by and this place is amazing"}
{"text":"The bun and pho here are both really really top notch.  The pho broth is very tasty, so tasty that I am inclined to just chug it down. The portions are big and well priced. The restaurant is very much set up like most other Vietnamese restaurants with zero flash - tables, chairs, and chopsticks. Cleanliness optional.

The service here is pretty good. They are always smiling and friendly.  I also like the fact that this is the closest Vietnamese restaurant to me."}
{"text":"Small portions, and long wait times, should have gone to Golden Turtle. Also staff calling everyone boss is not really business like, the Bun was a very small portion, with a very small spring roll. Maybe my standards are too high, as I have been going to a very good place for Vietnamese food."}
