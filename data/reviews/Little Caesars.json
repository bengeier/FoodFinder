{"text":"Not a half bad pizza pie for $6 and you're in & out in 2 minutes. Only about 4 pizzas to select from. The salad is way too salty - how do you make a really salty salad? Would like to see a little more meat on the pie but I know you get what you pay for. Just stick with the pizza folks and the crazy bread is alright too. It's a bit of a sorry looking pizza the next day, completely deflated, flat and hard. I just love that I can walk in, buy a pizza for $6 & walk right back out in 2 minutes!!"}

{"text":"I have had problems with this location many times. Slow service, Burt or expired pizzas, ect. But I continue to come because, well, its cheap and sometimes delicious. But what I experienced today was AWEFUL. My pizza was fine, but the young man working (and I do believe the black collard shirt he was wearing indicated he was a manager) was not only rude, but CLEARLY intoxicated. I could smell the alcoholon his breath over the usual aroma of pizza. He was stumbling, he looked ill, it was truely disturbing . This boy shouldn't even be working, non the less directing and managing the other employees. If he's still here next time I come in, I WILL NOT be coming back. This is rediculous."}
{"text":"I've only had issues with having to wait for a \"hot and ready\" pizza during their busiest times, and even then it wasn't a long wait by any means. Price, taste, wait: pick 2. If you want good pizza for cheap and don't want to wait: order in advance and spend more than the minimum! $5 for pizza is peanuts, you can't really complain when you're paying so little. 

My biggest complaint is the pizza being very inconsistent. One day it's covered in flour, another day it has too much sauce, another time it has giant dough bubbles and little cheese... it's as though everyone making the pizza there is following different guidelines. Sometimes it's fantastic and other times it's very mediocre. But at the end of the day, I knew I'll keep going back because it's cheap and there's no wait 90% of the time."}

She also said we cannot do that (with-out even breaking a smile) to indicate she was joking in the least. I then said I was joking of course but during the transaction she acted as though she was mad the entire time. In addition, each time I get pizza here it's always lukewarm at best.."}

I will never visit this location again. They shouldn't be allowed to advertise hot and ready if it's the same as placing an order at any pizza place.

We get the regular pizzas.  And it seemed like they were spicier than ever and my wife can eat them because of no Olive Oil. Not tonight cross contamination (again) . She had to take a double

{"text":"Go here often.   Kids favorite pizza which is convenient.  Everything is always good.   Give cookies to my kids.   Only reason I gave 3 instead of 5 is because a pepperoni pizza is $5, but if I call and order half cheese/half pepperoni so my kids can split it, the cost is $6.   Why do you charge a dollar more for half the toppings. Special order?   Come on!"}

Even complained to corporate website about this location  twice & never received a response. I wouldn't wait for this pizza. Will never return.

Was told their location no longer carried it. As the advertisement flashed behind his head for the stuffed crust pizza. So as I pointed it out to him he said yea not any more. So I politely asked him to call the next closest location who would take my order. He refused and said that I had the Internet on my phone I could order my own pizza. So I said let me have corporates # maybe they know what customer service is. And he gave me  602-272-5500 which I called in front of him and is a fax #. So I asked should I fax my order or can I have a real number. For real never thought ordering off a menus would be so difficult. I was then told if I was going to be smarting off to him or his employees he would have to call the cops to have me escorted off the property."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the pizza was from here.

I didn't order what most people get which is the $5 Pepperoni Pizza, instead I got the $9 veggie pizza.

And it was great, lots of toppings, thin crust and it was cooked just right and they had it ready in the 10mins that they said they would. I would go here again.

Service was good and the food was flavourful."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of Franchise pizza. I am talking the Pizza Nova's, Pizza Pizza's, Domino's, Pizza Hut's,  2-4-1's, and heck, 3-4-1's of our world. Little Caesar's blows all of them out of the water.

While the walk-in Hot and Ready $5 special is good, do yourself a favour and upgrade yourself to a deep dish. 

Holy mother of mercy. SOOO FREAKING GOOD!

They use a blend of Mozzarella and Muenster cheese on the sides of the crust and on top. The cheese on the crust gets crispy and crackly, while the cheese layer on top is gooey perfection.

I opt for the vegetarian special ($13) and substitute one of the veggies for Bacon. Why? Because Bacon is King. Duh.

Trust me, just go get yourself a pie, and thank me later! It's SOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my lunch to grab a \"hot and ready\" pizza.
 
Except it was not hot and ready, had to wait 10 mins for them to make it, thought the whole purpose of the hot and ready was to be convenient?

I would recommend that you perhaps phone ahead and ask if they have any \"hot and ready\" if not place your order so it will be when you arrive."}

In my opinion, this location has a disturbingly filthy front area, the employees are indifferent to the point of rudeness, and the cheese on my pizza was hardly warm.

But it was 2:20pm and that special ends at 2pm.  The gal was great on the phone and said she'd throw one in the oven for me just this once.  Great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Little Caesars...what can I say...but yum! It's weird to think that I prefer to grab a pizza and awesome breadsticks from Little Caesars rather then another Pizza Joint.  They've done a good job at this location with the fast service and the readily available pizza and breadsticks. 
As a very busy person with a family, it's the first place we go for a quick Pizza meal because of the convenience. If we weren't in a rush all the time, i would try a different more expensive Pizza joint...but that just never seems to happen...it's just too well priced and too easy to grab a pizza here.

Convenience sometimes means that we just take whatever is available and ready instead of having to wait for a specific type of pizza. It would be nice to have other selections available regularly to pickup then the standard few.
Overall, great Little Caesars location and well staffed, which means fast service."}
{"text":"Tried to buy a pizza. Was told that under no circumstances would they take a hundred dollar bill. The young kid said they don't have change, even though I watched 10 people in front of me pay with $20s, so he had at least $200. 

Told me to go somewhere else to eat or go next door at gas station and get change.

I chose to spend my money elsewhere."}

{"text":"When it comes to hot and ready; my 2 experiences with this restaurant failed to deliver both. The first time I purchased from there my \"hot and ready\" was ready but \"old and cold\" not to mention dry. My second experience with a \"hot and ready\" was not ready; and took 20 minutes...and when I did FINALLY get my pie it was bubbly. Apparently that's an issue at this store.

At 12:30pm they were already giving some kind of coupon to the people to come back another day as they said  not that they had run out of them but they had already given away all of their free allotments.  But they did go on to say that you could purchase the very same thing for $5

This is total bush-league as people plan to have their lunch when they go to one of these promotions and then they run into this type of __it.

Very good pizza you get it super fast and it's 5 dollars.

They even sell for 2$ a pizza bag do I can drive back home and my pizza is still warm. Also love the fact that they have so many choice of dipping sauce foe your pizza. The bread stick are also pretty good.

Only downfall is that they don't have many place to eat your pizza on site and they are not open late"}

{"text":"IS IT TRUE? IS IT POSSIBLE? A CHAIN PIZZA SHOP THAT HAS PIZZA THAT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE CARDBOARD?!?

Yes, it is! It's called Little Caesar's pizza and it tastes pretty damn good. Cheaper than Pizza Hut and Domino's on top of it. I guess there is a reason they've been voted by America as best price-value for 7 years in a row! I never got delivery so I can't advise against or for their service but the quality of the food is pretty damn amazing for what you pay.

I'd recommend their cinnamon sticks with vanilla dipping if you're not afraid of diabetes and a reduced life span due to possible obesity risks. The taste makes those two usually very important things practically trivial though.... (the fatty in me just doesn't care I guess :S!)

Sadly not much place to sit but it's more of a take-out place. The only seating are 3 (or 4?) stools on the side facing a wall with a metal counter attached to it. I'd describe it's primary use more as a waiting line than a table though.

P.S. You can steal Tim Horton's WiFi."}
{"text":"Just went here today to pick up a pizza and remembered for as many times that I go here, I have never left them a review. Well, let me tell you, they have yet to mess anything up for me. 

I always call in a funky order of pizzas for pickup. I ask for half this and half that with whole of this and that, etc. etc. And every time the order is correct, hot and fresh. I have had two other pizza places mess up twice. These guys have it right every time. They are friendly and pretty fast if there is a line. 

For cheep pizza, these guys make me feel like a million bucks. Highly recommend for a great deal and good pizza."}
{"text":"1/23/2018

I don't usually go to LC. It has a rep in my house for being neither hot or ready and suffice to say, we usually go elsewhere.

I decided to go today, which is a Tuesday. The store opens at 11am according to Google and according to their sign it also opens at 11am.

I arrived around 11:55am. Lights were on in the cooking area, but not in the front of the store. I knocked on the door anyway and I did see someone in there, but no one answered. I decided to wait 10 minutes or so and at 12:05pm, still no signs of being open.

I saw 4 other people check to see if it was actually open or not and then leave when they saw it wasn't.

I called customer service on them, but I'm probably not going to be going back. Pizza Hut might be more expensive, but at least they are actually open.

----

On a sidenote, it really frustrates me how hard simple things like letting people know if your store is open or not is these days."}
{"text":"We went in the other day and we got wings and pizza ready to go. You may want to call in before heading up there in case they are out. It's usually ready in minutes. Great prices. My son loves the pretzel bread pizza- very good.  With so many choices for pizza in this town their prices are best. 
 we love the wings - very moist and we like them with no sauce.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good value good service. The owners always around so you know itll be good. Find a better pizza for the price."}

{"text":"Don't buy the hype on hot and ready. Walk in between 4 and 8 and not one pizza ready in the place!!  Waited 25 minutes and service sucked.  Looks like we're going back off the grid. :("}
{"text":"I feel mixed about writing this review. With all I will document below, I still will stop in again for some hot-and-readys in the future. So, initially I was super excited to realize that there was a Little Caesar's on Center close to home- though I hate that shopping area because the traffic is always terrible and it's a nightmare getting in and out of. I planned a pizza night with a friend and timed it perfectly to stop in here for hot-and-ready pizzas after work to bring home. I even called in earlier to make sure that I could stop straight in, buy pizzas, and walk out.  I realize that it was right after work when they are probably at their busiest, but I walked in and there were no hot-and-ready pizzas there! Plus, there were only two people working! It upsets me when businesses advertise specials or deals and can't guarantee or follow through with them. I didn't have to wait long (maybe 10-15 min), but I implore Little Caesar's to ONLY promise hot-and-ready pizzas when they are both hot AND ready. On the other hand, the woman behind the counter was intent on getting the pizzas out as soon as possible and was incredibly nice- it's possible that they were simply understaffed for the day. And in their defense, the pizzas were hot and still tasted great- and you can't beat the price! The other items on their menu are a great deal two (i.e., only $3 for crazy bread sticks). With that said, I will definitely be stopping in again for those deals."}
{"text":"Really good, cheap pizza! 

Were else can you get a large cheese or pepperoni pizza for $5 everyday? Nowhere. The Italian cheese bread is yummy as well.
They have wings too."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru. I did not receive a warm welcome nor did I get a receipt. The outside of the location was clean. The pizza was hot but it had no appeal. Wasn't the best pizza ever but it wasn't the worst either. It's worth the five bucks"}
{"text":"Other than the fact that every time I come here I have to wait for pizza because they're always out (which is annoying and defeats the purpose of going there) The pizza is really delicious."}
{"text":"Wouldn't normally write a review about such a large chain pizza place however, I felt it was important based on my last couple experiences. The manager at this location (young woman with short hair) is an asset to this company. The way she handled a rude/angry customer was exceptional. Last time I was there she noticed an older gentlemen carrying a couple boxes to his car and ran out into the parking lot to assist him to his car. Just thought this was worth noting. She's the reason I will continue to return"}
{"text":"We haven't had Little Caesar's in a long time and just randomly craved a 5 dollar pizza. Well, it was a bad batch to get a refresher on the infamous cheap pie.

Pros:
- Professional staff 
- Quick service (5min)
- well priced 

Cons:
- Too greasy 
- Too much dough and little toppings"}
{"text":"It's $5 pizza. For the money it's perfect, my kids love it. The employees are mostly young kids who joke around with each other and seem to not hate their job. It's a factory and in the summer it must be rough. For $5 to feed 4 kids I don't think you could get more satisfaction."}
{"text":"Never been here without waiting 10+ minutes for a pizza. It's always hot never ready. They do not know how to do refunds so check order before paying.

Update: after getting my late pizza the manager put my name on a post it note for a free hot and ready next time I come in. Much appreciated though a little unorthodox."}
{"text":"Great quick service. I would go back again. The Circle K that it is in also has new coffee machines that made the coffee to order."}
{"text":"You get what you expect from a little ceasar's pizza spot and that's fast pizza for a cheap price. Hot and ready cheese pizza for 5 bucks is my go to when I go here. I don't like how they charge for parmesian cheese but it's not that big of a deal. It's not the best pizza in the world but it gets it job done and this Little Ceasar's is just as good as any other Little Ceasar's I've been to. Clean location with quick service."}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars I would.  I purchased a large cheese pizza this afternoon after taking my kids to the waterpark. My daughter was about to eat her pizza when she found a cooked beetle in her food. I called and the Manager Jeofry advised to come in for a refund. Once I returned to the store for a $5 dollar refund, he began to question me and the bug. I showed him a picture and he still denied that was their pizza due to no date stamp of when picture was taken...  The manager refused to give my $5 back, at this point it's principal more than about the money. I went home and found  the receipt to show I purchased the pizza with a beetle baked in it.  So much for valuing their  customers,  extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"After the gastley experience I had here a couple of years back I wasn't sure I would ever come back to this location.... but suffice it to say I did. Ordered the food when we got there. Service is what I would expect. Food is what I would expect. My only concern this time was the floor had napkins on it and could have really stood mopping"}
{"text":"Pizza isn't bad. I mean we all know what we're getting when we go to little Caesars. But the reality is this is a decent pizza at an affordable price. 

I gave three stars for two reasons. One:  I ordered onions added to this and there were none. And B:  the cut of the pizza really off target. 

Wait time was about 10 minutes. Not a big deal. 

I see a lot of comments about having to wait for a hot n ready but I I do t think waiting a short bit is a terrible thing. It was hot and fresh. I'm ok with waiting for that."}
{"text":"The pizza was well worth the money and made very hearty. I prefer the toppings and bottom crust cooked a bit more but overall the pizza was delicious. I do have one concern though. In watching the employee making the pizzas, she did not use gloves and answered the phone several times to take orders and then went back to touching the food. This is very unsanitary and can transfer bacteria. Luckily it was another employee that made my pizza but the young girl with long red hair needs a training course in cleanliness and food handling."}
{"text":"Placed my order before I went to go pick up our order because usually at dinner time they get really busy.  Service was quick, easy and friendly, pizza is delicious and my mom LOVED the garlic parm wings!"}
{"text":"Little Caesars:  \"WAIT, IT'S NOT READY!\"  I don't why this particular location NEVER has pizzas ready.  That's the whole point of going to Little Caesars, right?  You go in, give them $5 and walk right back out with a pizza.  It's really not worth waiting for, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I realize you get what you pay for quality wise, but having to wait for a \"hot n ready\" pizza and crazy bread to only then get a lukewarm cheese and cold tomato sauce dip was disappointing.  I'm usually fine with service and quality of pizza at Little Caesers, but after going to this location, I'll be looking elsewhere for pizza."}

It's obvious that you are limited."}
{"text":"Maaaan.  Twice in a row the online ordering system \"acted up\" on their end.  So when I get there, my food isn't ready and I have to wait 20 minutes (was told 10) for it to be made.  LC is a small step above a decent frozen pizza.  Wishing I went with frozen.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I get dinner here sometimes due to its fast and cheap. But I've regretted it the last few times. The hot and ready's were old and hard. Also the staff is usually absolutely awful and inappropriate. Complaining about the place to you and talking about their personal life when you just want to get a pizza. Usually they are all very dirty looking with food and flour caked all over their clothes."}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni hot-n-ready, and a crazy bread w/sauce. I drove all the way home to discover a hair inside the bag as soon as i opened it for the first time.

I drove all the way back (the 10 minute drive each way - 20 minutes round trip) and the manager was nice enough to replace the breadsticks. When I got home my pizza was cold. Thanks to having to drive all the way back and in essence waste an entire half hour i didn't even get to enjoy my meal.

I would appreciate it if someone would look into the employee's personal hygiene habits so this doesn't happen to someone else. I won't be returning to this location, but I would hate anyone else to find hair in their food."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to get pizza last night, never tried the wings so we asked the lady in front which ones she thought were the spicest wings, she  rudely answered with \"I'm guessing the ones that say spicy isn't it obvious\".... THEY WERE NOT SPICY AT ALL! Then we saw some new pizzas coming out so we asked for a fresh pizza vs the one they gave us that had just been sitting there for who knows how long and they said it would be extra to get a fresh pizza. So does that mean you can give me a discount when I have to wait too or are you gonna still charge me a dollar when your pizzas aren't ready? MAKES NO SENSE since it was already 9 o'clock. I understand pizza isn't the greatest but obviously your customer service is 100X worse!!! If I could give zero stars I would."}

{"text":"I went into the location three separate times ordering their deep dish pizza and asking them to cook it well done. When I picked it up, I asked for confirmation that it was well done. When I got home, we realized we were lied to and that the pizza was cooked regularly. Which is with doughy, undercooked crust. We love Little Caesars deep dish pizza at other locations, but this one can't follow simple instructions and lie to you when you ask if they got your order right. 

I won't eat there again and wouldn't recommend."}

There was a good bit of toppings on it but it being doughy messed up the whole pizza. It was so soft I could eat it with a fork and that is not good."}
{"text":"If I could've gave them zero stars I would. The pizza was the worst I've ever had. The employees were very annoying. I ordered a bbq chicken pizza and they gave me onions on bread. Disgusting animals"}
{"text":"Bad experience in both service and product.  Went there two weeks ago and waited for more than 20 minutes for one deep dish pizza.........because they had none prepared at 5pm on a Monday.  Went back today (Friday) at 4:15 pm.  Just needed one deep dish........had to wait for 20 minutes again in a store that was like a sardine can full of people. This store does not pick up their phone, so you can't call ahead and tell them to start a deep dish.  The deep dish we got for our trouble was all sauce, with lots of garlic, and nearly no cheese. It was mediocre at best.  We aren't always happy with other pizza chains, but we might need to pay a little more for better service and a better product."}

When I saw a commercial of them advertising their new stuffed crust pizza, I was all on board. It's so hard to find pizza joints that serve stuffed crust pizza, and it just sounded so good. So about an hour after they opened, my boyfriend and I went to go have lunch here. We ordered two stuffed crust pizzas and two cheesy breads (we like leftovers). It was great. The food was seriously very good and I was really impressed because I know quite a few people that really dislike Little Caesars. It only took about 10-15 minutes for them to prepare it, which I liked too. They have a whole cooler with Pepsi products to purchase as well. And a variety of dipping sauces to choose from. My only complaint is that the place looked a bit dirty. The floors needed cleaned, the ceiling tiles were water damaged and a few were missing or bent out of shape. The kitchen in the back was pretty clean though, which is a plus. The servers were very nice as well. And they also filled the containers of marinara sauce about half full, which was a little disappointing because it was really good marinara. The one women actually apologized to us that it was taking so long, but I didn't mind. I really wasn't in a hurry, but it was nice of her to say. Overall I really enjoyed it, I'll have to go back and try the wings and the cinnamon bite things they have, they look pretty good too."}
{"text":"This location seems to have improved staff seem a bit nicer than what I remembered. I used to go in and it was a bunch of kids who seemed to not care about anything and made me uncertain about buying anything I was going to put in my mouth there but I don't get that feeling anymore!

I give it a 4 because I can't give a 3.5. This is little ceasers pizza people a $5.00 pizza is exactly that! A $5.00 pizza! Keep your expectations in check. It's a good location because from 2-5 crazy bread is buy 1 get 1 free and they are always willing to make what I order fresh (1 pizza sometimes crazy bread) and in my opinion that's the only way to have it at little ceaser.

Never had the hot and ready wings so can't comment and I think it's silly there are no prices for anything or even a handout flyer in case you actually wanted to order something other than the $5.00 medium.

Overall those days I don't want to cook and don't want to spend $$$ little ceasers satisfies."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this business wasn't listed yet as it's been here for quite some time.

Anyway Little Caesars is what it is.  A pizza factory pumping out Hot and Ready pizzas by the stacks.  This particular location is a strip mall on the north west corner of Rathburn Road and The West Mall.  The site used to be an Esso station years back and was vacant for years after that business was taken down.  

Every time I buy food from this place a little bit of me dies in a sense that I am indirectly supporting 2 rival sports teams in that the owner of Little Caesars is the Illitch family in Detroit.  These are the same people that own the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings.  So while my brain is saying this is bad for Toronto sports love it's quite alright by my tongue and stomach because those 2 parts win the battle of am I going to eat this pizza or not...

The pricing is higher in Canada.  What isn't?  Some things but not many.  Cheese is WAY more expensive here... minimum wage is over 10 bucks so ya I can see why our Hot and Ready is 5.55 for a medium while the last time I bought Little Caesars in the US it was only 5 dollars for a LARGE.  

I'm actually more into the Deep Dish these days which is 10 bucks or 8 dollars in the US I think.  Either way that's been my Thursday ritual off and on for quite some time.  Why Thursday?  That's the day my wife doesn't make dinner because it's her cleaning day so it's sort of a guilty pleasure sort of treat... 

This location has specials sometimes and does things to help out locals which is a good thing.  They help out charities and even the local high school (Michael Power St. Joseph's).  

For what it's worth it's not common I can walk in and a pizza I want is ready.  I will basically ask what is ready before but since I've all about the Deep Dish now if I have to wait I will.  This place can get really busy sometimes and parking at this mall can be a pain.  People start parking along the north fence and now it's hard to get in and out of the place.  

They have wings too.  I've had them before and I'm not a fan.  Just give me the pizza and Crazy Bread because that's where the real goodness is... 

Cheap food, decent food and sometimes a walk in and walk out because they have what I want is ready situation?  Sold...  Oh by the way the pizza I picked up today was literally Hot and Ready because he was about to put it into the warmer but I bought it before he did ..... WHAT??? :)"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. The ingredients are so good, when you factor in low price it's unbeatable. The kids working counter are always, always busy. Sometimes it takes them a minute to get to the counter because it's almost always one person working so they have to do all the jobs at once. Great place to stop."}
{"text":"What's there not too like. Quick, read and fresh pizza that is usually ready when you just walk in and even if there isn't it's not a long wait so I like that.

There isn't as much diversity in choice but its good pizza."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Bad attitude from every single staff member. And a horrible product. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the Lunch Combo. It comes with four slices and a drink. Those four slices have pepperoni. If you ask if some other meat, it's a dollar extra. I asked, \"So what about people who don't eat meat or pork?\" I was told, \"You pay a dollar extra for anything else... or you could just get cheese.\" You're serving a large multi-ethnic population. There's a large Muslim population in this area (there's a mosque nearby). I'm a vegetarian. I should be allowed to replace that pork with another veggie or if I can't eat pork for religious reasons - I should be able to substitute."}
{"text":"I keep seeing the commercial for the $6,00 Extra Most Bestest Pizza and so I stopped in today....I hadn't had Little Caesars in more than 25 years !  I got 3 pizzas and an order of garlic bread.....the cashier was a very very nice guy.....my total was less than 25 bucks....the place was a little busy but both employees were calm, very polite and considerate......the one was helping a deaf senior citizen and he was extra nice, patient and kind to her.....I got my pizzas and went home......everyone LOVED the pizzas !!!!!!! It was wayyyyyyyy better than I remembered it and wayyyyyyyyyyyy better than any other 'chain pizza' I've gotten from local Penn Hills places.....it was well worth the drive to leave Penn Hills and the pathetic excuses they have for pizza places lately (read my other pizza reviews, Penn Hills locations have declined significantly)- again, it was worth the drive....The pizza was great ! The crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni.....it was really awesome. I will definitely return- fast excellent product and very very very nice employees- I LOVE it :)"}
{"text":"Is there better pizza in Pittsburgh... Yes. But can you get a pizza in under 10 minutes and for $5 if you pick it up... For an impromptu party for a bunch of high schoolers...perfect!  Little Cesar's is your place. It was hot and easy to reheat. It tasted good and everyone enjoyed! Definitely an economical way to feed a group with absolute no effort. 
Don't expect gourmet; it is basic pizza.
We ordered 5 pizzas and they were ready on 10 minutes. 
A definite recommendation from me."}
{"text":"This location just opened about a week ago, I stopped in for one of their ready-to-go Pepperoni pizza's for $5.  Should have checked it before I left, a good portion of the pizza was one of those strange burnt dough bubbles.  Oh well, it was $5 and covered a dinner and 2 lunches.  Maybe I'll pay the extra $1.50 next time to have one made fresh."}
{"text":"Obviously this crew has no idea what customer service is. And none of them know how much things cost!!! My daughter went in there and wanted crazy bread (which is $1.00 at every other location) but they charged her $2.79, which was for the combo, my daughter stated she did not want to combo, which included marinara sauce, just the bread. She was told (very rudely) that it's the same price with and without the sauce. Mind you, when she said\" I want the bread\" they bagged it up without the sauce, and did not even ask if she wanted it. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks it's odd that bread with and without a tub or marinara would be the same price. So I called the store later and asked for a manager. CHANDLER answered the phone and after several long seconds of hesitation he stated the manager wasn't there. I asked him the price of the bread, and he said he didn't know. How is it possible that you work some place with 5 things on the menu and have no clue how much it costs?! So after explaining that my daughter was upset, and maybe he should make sure that rest of the staff is aware of the difference in price for future transactions, he just sat there. He then stated there was nothing he could do about it and HUNG UP ON ME!!! 

Word of advice, the pizza is ok, but this locations customer service is less than subpar. I would subject that you drive well out of your way, if needed, to go another location."}
{"text":"Clearly I'm not their target demographic, as I avoid fast food and chains like the plague. My FIL wanted pizza one night and asked us to pick up the grab and go 'special' for him. How bad could it be? Ummm...

Having never tasted their products before, I thought maybe there was some horrible error, and that is why this 'pizza' did not look or taste like any I'd ever tried. Alas, Scott assured me that these were consistent with every other 'pizza' they'd had from LC. Oy! 

I.just.can't.even. The crust did not resemble any crust I've ever seen or eaten; the sauce was horrible; even the cheese had no flavor, and I love cheese! Didn't bother to try the \"Italian\" cheese bread sticks thing, because why waste carbs on pseudo food?!?! 

Costco food court pizza is VPN compared to this, trust. The cashier was friendly, the shop was clean, and my FIL likes the $5 special. I ate a slice to be polite, because I love my FIL and was taught to eat what your host serves you. Never, ever again for me. Ever. 

* $5 pick up specials for pizzas that are premade and hot *

** apparently there are also coupons available **

*** this is NOT actual pizza (I'm not sure WHAT it is) ***"}
{"text":"I wanted my 2 $6 pizzas made fresh and I was made to feel that was not gonna happen.  I will not go here again. Poor customer service!"}
{"text":"I asked for pizza at 5PM........it is 805 PM.....still no pizza.  They said, so sorry, we have it done by 6:45.  They didn't.  So unreliable

Edit:

\"No pizza till 9:30"}
{"text":"Great if you like your Pizza Crust almost raw.

My wife is in Savannah on a trip with the local Y so it's just me and the Corgi.  He likes Pizza and so do I and it's been awhile since I've had Litle Caesars so decided to give them a try. Have never been to this store since it's inside a Kangaroo Expres.  I've had the $5 lunch special at the Little Caesars in Statesville and it was pretty good so I expected more of the same.

Alas, was not the case.

I ordered a large three topping pizza and the person at the counter asked if I minded waiting for 6 minutes.  I said no because from my younger days when I worked part time at Domino's, I remembered it was more like 8-9 minutes.

Apparently still is because when I got home, the crust was so undercooked, it was almost raw.

Would not recommend this particular store until they learn how to properly cook a pizza."}
{"text":"A change in staff took a toll.  Rude, can't complete orders on time.  Out of stock often"}
{"text":"Typical, small, fair times. Nothing special but the food is whats expected. Kinda sketchy area at night but none the less, if you want some pizza...there is no reason to avoid this spot. They sometimes have local specials on their products that you don't find in other locations."}
{"text":"This place is always problematic! Slow service, rude people, etc... today came in and the employee was outside she came in when I went to the counter and said \"sorry were out of pizza\", wait, what, isn't that your sole business function!? She said we close in half an hour anyways... but you're not closed now... logic escapes this place"}
{"text":"They are on top of their game here.  I stopped on my way to the city and was craving the Hot N' Ready pizza and was not kept waiting.  I had less than a two minute wait and had my pizza in hand.  

The only thing they might want to brush up on here is the customer service aspect.  The staff member that took care of me never looked at me, talked very monotone, and showed no character whatsoever.  Granted, you only had to deal with me for a few minutes, but make me want to come back here."}
{"text":"I have to bump this up to five stars....I'm sorry, but craving a pizza and having that $5 with me beats a foot long any day!

I sing the praises for you Little Caesars, I really do.  Our love affair has gone way back and it will continue."}
{"text":"Was looking at the reviews of this and another Little Ceasars as they were both on the way to an event. The other one had horrible reviews, I am thinking...how can the reviews be this horrible for a place that basically makes less than a dozen options ?  Seemed to be the main problem was Hot and Ready was not either. I had never found that to be the case with my local LCP. Anyway, I chose this one. I was happy, my pizzas were Hot and Ready. LCP product is fairly standard, you will not get much if any variation from one place to the next. The quality is good and the price is very reasonable. And if you are in the mood for a good pizza, quick and for just a few dollars, you cannot beat this place. So, while it is not gourmet pizza, it is a go to place for what it offers."}
{"text":"The only reason they don't get a 5 star is because they did not have any cheese filled hot and ready pizzas, when I explained they might want to increase the inventory she agreed and told me they are delicious, I did not have 10 minutes to wait so I chose the deep dish that they had ready, food was great and worker at counter was polite.  I just wish they had pizzas ready"}
{"text":"After finally (and I mean after driving for a bit and listing him over 100 places that may hook my bfs taste buds) deciding on getting pizza for dinner. Only to get to the first pizza place and discovering that they did not have the pizza flavour my bf wanted. Noticing that the slices were also quite dinky,  we looked at each other and immediately said \"let's go somewhere else?\". So back into the car we go on our way to the sub resto he was craving. \"and I just was supposed to turn right there...\" he says and he turns into the plaza where this Little Caesars is housed. \"wanna get little Caesars?! You've always wanted to try!\" he goes \"okay ya sure I've been wanting to try everytime I see the commercials.\" So we strut in and take a look at their specials and decide on the 3 meat pizza with creamy garlic dipping sauce to share. The best part?! We didn't   have to wait. The server already had the pizza ready for us and we left to eat in 5 mins of entering. $8.50 for a medium pizza. The taste was very good and satisfying. Definitely not for anyone on a diet. The toppings were generous, very hot and steamy not stale. The crust was very good toasty and warm. Does not taste like cardboard, I repeat does not taste like cardboard. I would definitely return, this is a good place for good pizza that's really quick. No need to wait around. Sometimes hard to find new places to eat in midtown."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of Little Caesars pizza in the past, but after seeing the commercial for stuffed crust decided to try it out. If you want it delivered its a minimum order of 30$, so it's much better to pick it up. Was 17$ for a large all dressed stuffed crust. It was hot and fresh and very delicious. Since Pizza Hut doesn't deliver to my area anymore, i will be going here for my stuffed crust instead."}
{"text":"Just waited 18 minutes to get my supposedly hot and ready pizza. The wait time was ridiculous, if I knew it was going to be that long I might as well have just ordered carry out from another pizza place. Only good thing about this place is it is cheap. And I guess you get what you pay for when it comes to service, obviously there's going to be a dinner rush so they should be more prepared."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ever call in orders for this place. Every time I call in my order they always get it wrong. This is the third time in a row that I have called in my order, they tell me \"it's going to be 10 or 15 minutes, \" I actually give them  fifteen minutes extra (showing up 30 minutes after I order) and I they  my order wrong. Somebody either forgets to put something in, automatically assumes everything has pepperoni on it, or they give away my cheese bread before I get here. I'm actually here right now after I ordered 40 minutes ago to find out The cooks made two pepperoni pizzas without looking at the actual order that said two cheese pizzas, it's written right on my receipts that there are two cheese pizzas and two cheese breads.  My actual order is correct on the receipt but some people are into much of a hurry to actually read what was ordered .   On top of that, they completely forgot to make my cheese bread. So now I'm having to wait 10 extra minutes. You would also think they would have more people working during the rush-hour time. The line is out the door and it's 110°. The kids working here have no idea what they're doing.
I would like to amend my review and say that one of the kids behind the counter saw me sitting in my car with all of my kids waiting for the pizza. I was actually typing this review. He came out into the parking lot looking for me I brought my pizza to the car. He gave me a few extra sauces too. He just wanted to make right what the girl on the phone had gotten wrong and the cooks in the back. At least one of them was trying to help a customer. I do appreciate that."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 large sausage with light sauce, 1 thin crust veggie with light sauce. After they \"messed up\" by putting both toppings on one pizza, we waited another 20 or so minutes only to leave with 1 large sausage with reg. (or extra?) sauce, and 1 hand-tossed veggie with sausage on it. WTF?"}
{"text":"Quick and easy, ready made pizzas can't be beat for those in a hurry. Crazy bread is always a nice addition."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Little Caesars and I went for the wings. Really tasty wings, medium spicy and really delicious. Little side note that they do not offer breaded wings, only regular and their pizza offerings are whole pizzas only, no slices offered."}
{"text":"Went into this store 20 minutes before closing. The doors were open. Normally I am very understanding of things being unavailable closer to closing, however the guy said that they were closed and out of everything. We asked for the managers name and he said he was the manager. I don't understand why during their business hours they would have NO pizza whatsoever and to top it off the guy was completely rude about it. Not to mention there were 2 girls waiting outside to back him up with \"yeah he said he's closed\" giggling as we walked away. This store is completely unprofessional and I will never take my business there again."}
{"text":"If you're looking fore a quick and easy night, little caesars in Pickering, is the place to go. Their exceptional service and kind and friendly attitude is just enough to go in for. 
All of their dough is hand made and made at the store day of, the sauce is made at the store and all of the cheese they use is 100% real. It doesn't get much better than that. Even if I ever have a problem with my order, they are extremely understanding and ready to fix it. I don't even mind waiting the five minuets for a fresh pizza, because I know it will be exceptional."}
{"text":"There was a hair baked into my pizza. My crazy bread had literally no seasoning. Very disappointing. Went back to explain, they have me a new pizza which was fine but the second crazy bread they gave me was worse then the first one! I want CRAZY bread not dull bread.."}
{"text":"I got the box special I had seen on TV. It was very good! I waited while they made it. I don't know if that is something that is on the Hot and Ready menu or not. I would much rather order and wait a little bit so that it is fresh, my personal preference. I like the crazy sauce so its a no brainer for me!"}
{"text":"Three starts for consistent delivery of course quality food! My 'go to' pizza place above others (I.e Barro's, Papa Johns, Dominos) this place is the best. Today, however, the customer service is his older female is putting me in a mood. She is negative, rude, not friendly. I hope she changes her tune. I might have to get my pizza from a different location"}
{"text":"I was disappointed because the place said they open at 10:30, I arrived 5 mins before they were supposedly opening at along with 3-4 other people. As it was time for them to open the door was not. One by one customers were leaving I was the last one standing and finally the door opened at 10:45. I placed a hot and ready order and still had to wait another 5-10 min. I expected the door to be open at 10:30 as it advertise and the hot and ready READY to be serve. On the plus side I got my food fresh and hot."}
{"text":"This was actually my first time ever eating at a Little Caesars. I've seen the ads over the years, $5 pizza, hot and ready inside of a K-mart, and frankly cheap pizza from a cheap retail chain on the verge of bankruptcy didn't interest me at all.

However there was a promotion at Little Caesars this year related to \"March Madness\" college basketball, offering a free pizza and drink, and I happened to be driving by when it was going on, so I decided to try it.

I was pleasantly surprised! My Sicilian style slices with pepperoni were a bit greasy on top, so I dabbed them with a napkin first, but the taste and texture was excellent. The crust was chewy in the middle, crunchy at the bottom, just how I like it. 

The crew at this shop did an admirable job of keeping the line moving at a good clip by making pizzas as fast as they could, and they can indeed make them quickly. They also went the extra mile handing out little bags of Easter candy and being polite to the customers despite the onslaught of people. This is not the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it's a very respectable and affordable pizza, and frankly it's a notch or two better than Papa Johns, Pizza Hut or Mineo's, in my opinion, but 3 notches below Vincent's Pizza Park or Shelly Pie."}
{"text":"Here it is, Hot and Ready! This is the best bang for your buck in the pizza world. This location is always Johnny on the spot for those nights when there is no time to cook dinner.  The kids that work there are always cool with me, and as quick as a pizza goes out they have another one coming out.

$5 for a pepperoni, in a hurry and on the go......can't beat it."}
{"text":"The entire advertising campaign is centred around \"hot and ready\" pizza. But when you get there the pizza is not ready. You have to order it, and it takes a long time. And there are threatening young men loitering in the parking lot."}
{"text":"We tried their new Hawaiian pizza and it was really quite good. The pizza's are always ready when you walk in (well, for the most part... I think I had to wait once but only because they were really busy).  Of course, I can't get Little Caesars without getting their crazy bread! This is the perfect grab 'n go dinner and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the premise of hot n ready if Little Caesar's never has the deep dish actually hot and ready. EVERY SINGLE TIME I ask for one, the person at the register ALWAYS has to call to the back to have one made and it's ALWAYS 10-15 min. Which ends up being MUCH longer.  You shouldn't advertise the deep dish as hot and ready till 8pm when at 7:35pm I'm sitting in the store waiting.  It would b one thing if it was a rare occoasion, but literally no joke, EVERY SINGLE TIME, no matter what store or time I come in. 

If I wanted to wait 20 min, I would have just ordered Dominoes.  

I'm over Little Caesar's"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I'm a total geek for the $5 carry out deal. I have come to this location on more occasions than I care to admit. I have had a great experience 9/10 times. I have noticed that if I call ahead just ten or fifteen minutes I tend to get a fresh pizza instead of one that's been sitting in the heater. 

I personally find the staff to be friendly and if you engage in conversation you can certainly make some friends. They always hook me up with a few extra Zap Packs (Little Caesar's seasoning). 

I don't understand the bad reviews at this location, the service is quick and the pizzas are usually fresh. Again if you just call ten minutes in advanced you will get a much better pizza right out of the oven. 

This isn't a fine dining establishment, so let's be realistic with our expectations people. It's a five dollar pizza with plenty of flavor and a overall impressive value."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight and supposedly I was speaking with the GM!! He was screaming at me in front of customers and his staff and setting a horrible example. I asked for two dips and he thought I wanted one, I offered to pay for the other dip but he decided to scream and yell instead. No customer service and he set a bad example for other employees as they will think it's okay to yell at customers. I will go out of my way to go to another little Caesars instead of this one and on top of that my pizza was cold and hard as a rock!!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service EVER!!!!!...
Slow as hell and store is filthy..
Just walked out......"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want to feed the family fast and for under $10.  That's when we stop by and get a HOT N READY cheese pizza and bread sticks.  No, it's not the best pizza in the Valley, but considering it's less than $6, it's decent....and no, it's not always READY, but I can wait 3 more minutes for a fresh pie.  The people here are friendly too.  A OK."}
{"text":"Little Caesars is alright, I like the convenience when the pizza is ready when you walk in.  The pan pizza is good for the price, but for some reasons I try to get the cinnamon twist dessert but it wasn't ready and I would have to wait for it.  That's 2 out if 3 times now that the dessert wasn't ready.  I'll probably go to another pizza chain for a while until Little Caesars figure that the lack of having the menu items ready is costing them customers.  I'll give it 6 months to a year before I go back, that gives management time to properly train their staff."}
{"text":"Simply the worst wings I've ever tried in my life.  Just awful.  They were rubbery (do they cook them in a microwave?) and small.  The \"butter\" garlic sauce was some sort of petroleum-tasting margarine that even my dogs weren't excited to chomp on (and they eat their own poop).  The lemon-pepper wings also had a very strange artificial taste to them, and equally rubbery.

The pizza is pretty much just a huge pile of bland dough with minimal amounts of toppings.  They must use a high-precision laster to cut pepperoni that thin.

I wouldn't take it as free food."}
{"text":"If i could give this place 0 stars, i would. I will be complaining to the health ministry as their bathroom is DISGUSTING. Piss everywhere, all over the toilet, floor and even wall  and it smelt like it has been there for hours. Any place that can't keep their facility clean, surely cant keep their food clean. So unless you want contaminated food, i suggest eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave reviews for Little C's....because yknow....its pretty basic.
But this branch deserves a good review. Their pizza has always been cooked PERFECT. 
Service has always been good. Sometimes peak times require a 10 min wait (understandable)...and the staff always shows me the pizza before I pay. Crazy bread could use some work...but I have this issue at every location.
Really surprised to see 2 and a half stars. Ignore that...go here. Consistently good, cheap pizza."}
{"text":"Great fresh off the oven pizza, great price and good amount of toppings. I bought from this place twice and each time pizza was great. I think will continue buying from them from now on."}
{"text":"Fast service.
Un clean restaurant.
Loud ethnic music.
cheap prices

I will say not bad at all."}
{"text":"Compare this location & two others. 
This Ray/Rural location by Alberson's is the most consistent one for their $5 pizza.
They either have a great management that I can always count on very hot pizza anytime of the day,
or it's just my luck every time.

The Broadway/Rural Location,sometimes good, sometimes not so.
It depends on the time you go, if the pizza is waiting for you in the oven for a long time,
then it's dry.

The one at Guadalupe/Rural, Do yourself a favor, avoid this one.
 The $5 pizza there is consistently bad.
Different problem every time, either crust burnt or very dry on top;
 & the cheese amount is pathetically stingy compare with Ray/Rural location
for the same $5 pizza."}
{"text":"We walked in about a half hour before closing. I hate being \"that guy\", but we really wanted pizza... so anyways, we walk in, and the employee walks out from the back, super good mood, super nice, and super helpful. He offered us more toppings, and sold us on another pizza! What a great staff! We drove 20 minutes just to get there, and we were super happy with everything!!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong for five bucks.  The kids love it, there is never a wait, and its close by.  The pizza is consistent. I certainly can not complain about a five dollar pizza.  Why the high number of stars if the pizza is only ok?? Convenience, convenience, convenience."}
{"text":"WARNING: Disappointing. It's been years since we had Little Caesars pizza. I ordered 4 pizzas. When I was ordering they notified me that they sell a not fresh pizza for $5 and if you actually want it cooked fresh they charge you a $1 more?!?!  

I specifically requested my pizzas be made fresh and when I arrived to pick up my pizzas they still handed me the pizzas that were already made. 

Don't bother asking for the manager... I did and was put on hold. When the young man came back he told me there's no manager in the store?  

The pizzas were good and we enjoyed them. Too bad we will not be back anytime soon due to the poor service and shady attention to detail."}
{"text":"We decided to order pizza for last minute dinner plans. It was ok, nothing spectacular. I do have to say it satisfied our pizza and pineapple cravings. They are very quick."}
{"text":"I called in an order at 4:40pm on Friday.  I was told 15-20 minutes for pickup.  I made one stop on the way and arrive at 5:20. I was told my pizza was in the oven then the lady asked me what I ordered to key it into the register. Should she already know? I paid and then waited.  She took care of a couple more people including another lady that placed an order by phone and her order was not ready wither when she arrived to pick it up. Everyone else was just getting a hot n ready pizza. About 5 minutes after I paid, the lady went into the kitchen to make my pizza.  I knew it was mine because it was a specialty pizza.  I then received my order at 5:41pm. A young kid was told by the lady to give me my order.  When he handed it to me, I expressed my dissatisfaction for the wait and he just laughed at me! I again said that I should've have had to wait and felt that I was lied to once I arrived. I made sure everyone in the store and kitchen heard me too! I believe that the order was never written down and was forgotten about until I arrived to pick it up. Very unprofessional staff!"}
{"text":"Yo, I never have complaints with no body no how, but I went into this little ceasers last night. I know they were about five min from close, i asked for. Peproni pizza. Some curly headed Richard face told me they couldnt becuase it was too close to close. First of all i work in food. That doesn't matter. Second I let that go because I clear wasn't gunna get my delicious extra peproni, wings, and Italian cheese bread. So i just took the boring ass plain cheese and stale bread sticks. Then I try to pay with a gift card, my mother brought it for me, so I knkw it has money on it. I mean its my mother a sweet old lady, but anyways it wasnt working in the card reader said it was an error. I asked him to enter it manualy, this mother freaker told me there was no way possible to do that and walked away. I shall not return to this location, which sucks cuz I walk there quite often, until that curly headed butt wipe no longer works there. Thank you."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times, especially during lunch time when I treat my kids to pizza and crazy bread. I have always had good and fast service, the pizza has always met my expectations and more. When I am on my way I always call and order, so they have my order ready, even if it's the express menu. It's always a great fast and fulfilling treat! That crazy bread is Fine!"}
{"text":"Do you snub a place because they're cheap, and you equate cheap with inferior or sub par quality? Do you snub something because people never mention them, and they don't get reviewed, even once, on Yelp?

Shame on you. SHAME ON YOU.

I used to be that person. I'm guilty of all of the above, especially in regards to the pizza with the a toga-wearing guy who thinks he's funny. I know, I know, shame on me.

I was \"introduced\" to this place when I first came to the states almost 20 years ago, I was young then and my cousin was even younger. Fast-forward almost 20 years, I found myself ordering stuff from this place while I was visiting the Phoenix metro area. He swore by this stuff. He told me how the pizza was NOT half-bad, and the price made it more appealing. 5 bucks a one topping pizza, how can anyone refuse? Additional toppings extra, and so are thin crusts and deep dish, but that's to be expected.

Remember, they don't deliver. That's how the keep the prices dirt-cheap. The people there were very nice, and was not pushy about upselling anything. They also have dipping sauces, which I got the garlic butter one. They have chilled soft-drinks, and that's a good thing since it's hot here. They also have the infamous Crazy Bread. Gotta taste it to believe it.

So, you ask, why did I give four stars to a place that I snubbed till this place changed my mind? Take notes, here's the formula:

Cheap pizza + Ok pizza + convenient location + nice people and service + my attitude adjustment = 4 stars!

Did you get that? The lesson you should learn:

Don't knock it till you try it."}
{"text":"So we have been going to this Little Caesars for 2 years. Today I went for our weekly pizza trip (don't judge me, we all have something), and for the 3rd time only HALF the pizza had sauce and cheese. So I asked the question I was dreading the answer to and not surprisingly, this location has CHANGED HANDS. I have yet to visit another Little Caesars that does their pizzas the way this one now does. The kid behind the counter said they have a \"guide\" (looks much like a blue round stencil) they put over the pizza to line the edge where the sauce and cheese go and that's all they put on the pizza...so now my question is, is this a corporate thing?  Doesn't seem so. No other locations I've been to, have been quite so disappointing. I'm very passionate about my pizza actually having cheese and sauce on most of it, not just the center half. The guy helping me was very apologetic, but I'm just guessing they're going to start losing quite a bit of business on this deal.  He didn't know how to refund my pizza when I asked if I could just have that removed from the bill because the owner/manager hadn't shown him how, but gave me a free pizza card punched for my next visit (expired 12/2017). Will I even be able to use it at another location? Who knows."}
{"text":"The fast pizza is a great invention. Some times it comes out good and sometimes it dose not. Now that the $6 pizzas are on the market , the pizza is way way better and the cheese sticks are delicious."}
{"text":"Went there at 12:30 on a Friday. The hot and ready was a 10 min wait. Always out of most good soda (Pepsi, Mountain Dew) only generic and diet. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick snack. I ordered the Crazy Combo, it comes with crazy bread and sauce. The cup was not even half full. I didn't notice until I got to work.... Too late...
It lasted four breadsticks.

I know for a fact this is not even a full ladle scoop.

The taste is pretty standard, 

At least there was an extra stick of bread, there is usually eight, I got nine under cooked breadsticks.

Don't hold this against all little caesars, just this one."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here however, I have attempted to at least 4 times.  The Hot and Ready Pizza is NEVER ready.  4 times I have tried to grab a pizza here.  They always quote me 10 minutes.  If I wanted to wait 10 minutes for a pizza, I sure as hell wouldn't be ordering Little Caesars.  

So I usually leave and call in an order somewhere else.  If I'm waiting 10, might as well wait 15-20 somewhere better."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We waited a good 15/20 minutes for pizza that is supposed to be \"hot and READY\".. And nearly the entire time we sat there waiting, one of the employees sat on his phone doing God knows what..

OBVIOUSLY NOT HIS JOB.

The pizza itself was ok. The three meat treat was kind of pathetic. It was basically pepperoni with a couple pieces of sausage on top, and about $3 more expensive.

A woman walked in about 10 minutes through our wait time and was standing at the front counter for a good 2 minutes before being noticed by one of the staff (the one who was on his phone), and served. Only to be told that it would also take 15 minutes for a pepperoni pizza.

Bad customer service, and definitely won't be coming back.."}
{"text":"Understaffed. Uneducated teenagers, who don't care. I got the opposite of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Order food comes to payment front counter goes we don't accept American Express. Since when does a business decided what cards they will except or not"}
{"text":"It took them 20 minutes to get me my \"hot-n-ready\" lunch special. I was literally the second person there at 11:30 and they didn't have anything made. If I wanted to wait for pizza I would have gone down the street to Pizza Hut. I was on a strict time frame and needed lunch quick."}
{"text":"My husband and I stop in here on occasion if we're out and about and need something quick for dinner. For $5, you get an 8-cut plain or pepperoni pizza. Not to shabby. You can also choose more toppings, for more money of course. For example, a supreme is $10. There's really not much else to say about this place. The pizza is definitely not the best around, but it is extremely fast and convenient in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Not a big pizza person, but when I'm lazy and don't feel like spending a lot of money on a quick dinner I'll come to a Little Caesars. This is one of the better locations that I've been to. They are never busy, at least at the times I come, they always have \"Hot & Ready\" pizzas ready and the staff always seem pleasant. 

This location is at the corner of Greenway and N 35th Ave. They share a parking lot with the shopping center, but since the business beside it is empty, they have plenty of parking for their customers. The inside is very small, with possibly 2 or 3 seats for waiting customers. 

Their pizza is pretty much the same as any other location. Great tasting crust, plenty of cheese and pepperoni and it's always hot and tastes fresh. I think what makes this location stand out from other locations is their staff. The person working the register is very professional and polite. Always greets their customers when you enter and wishes you a great day as you're exiting. 

Overall a great spot to pick up something cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"I'd  give this place 5 stars for the food quality! Always delicious. Obviously you can't beat a $5 pizza! Could be in a better location. Or even better yet closer to my house since our local store closed. I now drive 20-30 min for pizza. Lame!"}
{"text":"I just love the place I've never had a bad pizza, food is always hot customer service is good what more can one say stop and check it out"}
{"text":"Medium pizza topped with chicken, onions and cheese for $8.50 - what a deal
Simple ingredients and also noticed that there is no tomato sauce which I actually like. A nice crunch to the crush. Everything was very good. I can't wait to have another."}
{"text":"Decently priced and go-to pizza place for my kids to eat.

The 'crazy bread' is def crazy good! Recommend!!!

Would have given 5 stars except that this  location is a hit and miss on how fresh the pizza is. PLEASE check your pizza before you leave to see if it's fresh."}
{"text":"Friday night and my cousin's family was travelling back to the Philippines after a 3 week vacation.  What better way to send them off by ordering a couple 'o pies before their long flight!  Canadian style!!!

We ordered 3 medium pizzas, crazy bread, marinara sauce and garlic sauce.

Pizza (Deluxe, Canadian & Pepperoni).  We made use of the 'Hot-N-Ready\" special with Crazy Bread.  The Deluxe and Pepperoni pizzas were decent but the Canadian pizza was not as fresh but it was definitely hot and ready.  The Crazy Bread was GOOD!  I certainly liked how fresh it was.

For what it's worth (pretty cheap), it did the deal and fed our family.  I have experienced better Little Caesars pizza but it did come out within 8 minutes, so it was fast.  And that was a plus.  Put the taste on the backburner!"}
{"text":"This location has been our \"go-to\" place for fast, last minute pizza for the kids when we are in a hurry! With four kids, they love their bread sticks and pretzel pizza. They were sad to recently find out they no longer have the pretzel pizza so needless to say...no more little Caesars for awhile. 
Pizzas are average at best for quality but convenience is the key with busy family life.  

The best thing about this location is their ready-to-go pizzas and breadsticks. In and out in 5 minutes every time."}
{"text":"On 3/22/2017 at 3:05 I called in an order for 1 Smoke House BBQ and 1 Deep Dish. Thinking both would be made fresh as it was called in was a mistake. Got there at approx 3:25 and my order was ready, but upon looked at both pizzas I could tell the smoke house was not freshly made. The cheese looked old some of the meat was died out and it was luke warm to the touch.

Very disappointed in the service I received on this day. If you want fresh hot pizza your best to go in and order and wait the 10 to 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Meh...

I had talked it up to my friend about how you can just walk in and ask for a pizza and hand them some cash, they hand you a pizza and you are back home eating all in a few minutes.  That isn't what happened at this location at all. We went in and asked for a $8 Deep Deep Dish Hot & Ready and were told it would be 10 minutes or so. There were no pizzas in the warmers at all. The next person ordered just a $5 pepperoni and got the same response we did.  It was kind of a bummer because I had made such a big deal out of it. There were only two people working at 6pm on a Thursday night and they were both slow movers. They did not seem very happy or motivated to be there and just went through the motions. We didn't get an apology, explanation or anything. Just a blank look of despair. So we waited and when we did get our food it was pretty good. My friend who had never had Little Caesar pizza really liked it. The Deep Deep Dish is where it's at!  Hot and Ready is not true here. Too bad they can't get their act together. This would be a great quick place to swing through after work once in awhile. But if I have to wait, I'll just order from a higher quality pizza joint."}
{"text":"Went in an hour before close and wanted to order 6 pizzas. The guy working told us he only had 3 and wouldn't make more for us because he needed to catch the bus in 30 minutes to get home. Could not believe they wouldn't make us more pizza... the employee told us to just go to dominoes. I'd suggest the same.. stay clear."}
{"text":"I had a couple but because I was 10 minutes late they refused to allow me to use it. Manager said it was because of computer. ..I think not. Poor customer service here. Definitely lost my business."}
{"text":"Hot-N-Ready Pizza is just a moment away.

From Wings, to Crazy Bread, this pizza place is hot-n-ready now.

The pizza, cheese or pepperoni, is usually ready for you to take with you, no waiting, and for the price of $5.55 it is not a bad deal.

This is located in a strip mall in front of the super Walmart, it is carryout only.

{"text":"Two years ago we visited this pizza location as my daughter was having a birthday party and it was convenient party food.  We called the pizza place several hours ahead to place our order asking to have it ready at a specific time for pick up.  When we arrived at that time the pizza had not even been cooked yet and we had no choice but to wait.  By the time we got back to the party, it had already started - they made us late.  

Fast forward to the present.  My son now having a birthday party near by and so we decided to use Little Caesars Pizza once again for the party.  We called it in again, advised how our order was not ready the last time and PLEASE have it ready on time for pick up.  The guy said absolutely.   I arrived at said time and guess what?  The pizza was not even cooked yet...once again putting me behind and making me late for the party.  I told the guy at the counter this pizza was supposed to be ready now and he said \"I dunno I just started\".  Like really?  This is good customer service how?  No apology...perhaps a discount, I don't really know because there was no communication whatsoever.  Not even a thank you!!!  And one of the pizzas WAS not cooked properly as the crust was doughy.  Yuck.

We will never get pizza from this franchise and/or location again as there was nothing good about it either time we went."}
{"text":"Ok, so here's the deal - it's Little Caesars Pizza where you can get a large pizza for $5. Not some specialty Italian gourmet restaurant where the chef did a 6 month internship in a world renowned pizzeria to learn the ways of generational pizza making.

With that said, it's decent, borderline good pizza. I prefer the deep dish and their cheese breadsticks. They also have a nice variety of sodas (they had Dr. Pepper which is a rarity).

The employees are decent. Except once I pulled up 5 minutes before closing. A guy literally leaped over the counter to lock the door and turn off the \"Open\" light sign. 

Um. Rude.

But it's essentially fast food so I don't expect much from them. As long as my food is edible and no one insults/assaults me, I'm good."}
{"text":"This location is s LOT better than 2 Little Caesars locations I go to by my house. This is my second time at this location. Even their customer service is better, wait times are shorter, and they seem to be more organized than by my house."}
{"text":"The location at 37th & Happy Valley is NORMALLY very pleasant. Never had any issues other than waiting no more than 5 minutes. I went in there today for a couple $5 lunch specials and a $5 cheese pizza, and the old guy behind the counter told me it would be a few mins. No big deal. I then notice that people who arrived AFTER me are getting the same items that I had ordered before me, and finally after 20-25 mins, I receive my food, and a weak apology after I refused their \"sorry I screwed up and forgot your order\" food. I then place a complaint, and about 4 hours later, I get a call from the freaking old guy at the Little Caesars responding to my complaint. It turns out that HE is the owner. So then I had to deal with him all over again. That was REAL pleasant. Thanks Little Caesars. You just lost yourself a HUGE amount of business.

{"text":"If you're looking for a place to take your sweetheart, but don't want to break the bank, then little ceasers is your best choice. 

First off let me say this review may be a bit biased, since i hail from italy and pizza is obviously my favorite food. Nevertheless, this is some of the best pizza you can get in Calgary, and at 6 dollars for an entire pie, you'd have to have mental problems not to eat here. 

I usually go for the classic pepperoni, just like mama used to make in Naples. The crust is always impeccable, made with the finest double zero flour and imported semolina, baked in the authentic wood fired oven it is light yet crunchy. Next we have the sauce... tangy and simple, made from fresh vine ripened passata tomatoes and fresh picked herbs. The cheese is sourced from local dairy farmers and is a proprietary blend of hand stretched mozzarell, smoked gouda, and parmiangano. Incredible. 100 day dry aged pepperoni tops off this masterpiece, perfectly smoked yet intricate. 

Though the employees at this location may seem quite young, some of them not even old enough to vote, dont let that frighten you away. These youngsters really know their stuff when it comes to bringing the taste of the old country to beautiful wild rose country."}
{"text":"The manager Johnny is an idiot I do not know if he was on something or what I called the other day let him know the cheese was like cardboard solid first he said take a picture and send it so he could see then he told me nevermind just come back and we'll take care of it I gave him my name I thought everything would be good so when I called him yesterday he basically said sorry bud can't help you deal with it I do not care if you come back or not he is not good for business he lost a good customer for many years over a couple of pizzas I called the Little Caesars corporate number and unfortunately that location is privately owned I would not recommend you going there unless you want bad service and pizza like rolling the dice I'm not the kind of guy who says oh well our pizza is screwed up let's just hope it's better next next time these places are billion-dollar corporations if they screw up and I do not get what I paid for I expect for them to make it right needless to say I will not be going back over there that guy is a complete doofus"}
{"text":"Five Star review because this place is always friendly, the food is ready (everytime so far... Not like other locations in the city), and the prices are amazing for yummy pizza and breadsticks. 
You have to order the Italian Cheese Bread!!! It's $4 and it's my most favorite thing from this place. 
My kids love the pizza which I will be honest, I was a little leery about feeding my kids food from a place that has $5 cheese pizzas. However, I was pleasantly surprised and now this is my go to lazy dinner place. (No joke!)
I used to live in NY and this is certainly not New York style pizza but sometimes after a long day at work feeding my family seems so be much easier with a quick stop to pick up some pizzas and be out in less than 5 minutes, everytime! BAM!!
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, terrible service. I ordered crazy bread with an online coupon and the employee wouldn't accept it from my phone. She started to speak to me rudely and told me that she didn't understand why I was disappointed because ALL other customers have printed the coupon and I was \"the first one to try using my phone\". Was the pizza good? Yes. Will I ever go back to this location? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Last several times I've been here there is no hot n ready at all. I'm easy - just give me whatever pizza is ready... oh it's 10 min?

On the plus side they have been putting some $$$ into the place. 
It's significantly nicer than it was 6 months ago. Seems like every time I come it's a little better.  (Hence the 3 stars)"}
{"text":"How do you know you will for sure get stomach ache?
If you eat thick doughy crust, oily bad quality toppings and bad greasy sauce... oh wow even the meat seemed dried up and then made wet again for the purpose of the pizza.

{"text":"I've visited this location several times and am always satisfied with their customer service.They are very nice and helpful.$5 for a pizza?Why not!The manager their is very nice and always asks me how I am doing.He actually remembers me every time I go in, that always makes a business easier to go back to.I love the food and love their service."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly, the only down side is that there is rarely anything hot and ready for the taking. Usually a 10min wait. Not horrible, but not great."}
{"text":"The original $5 Hot and Ready.  Picked up one of these two nights ago and forgot what you get for your money.  This pizza was huge and for only $5, awesome!!  Now it's not the best pizza and I'm really only rating the value.  I honestly think that Caesars changed their pizza sauce cause it didn't have the zing that I remember.   

You can also get $5 wings, $3 bread sticks with your order, so for $12, its quite the complete meal for 3-4 people.  I prefer this pizza over Georgio's and Tony's on Chardon.  Just make sure you open the pizza before rushing out of there.  If it looks old, just ask for a different one and they will accommodate."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of little Caesars cuz it's cheap and fast. But I prefer not to have the hot and ready. I'd rather wait ten minutes for a fresh one. 5.00 is a very good price. And pretty darned good for the price. I'm glad there's one in my current neighborhood."}
{"text":"For a chain, this place is good. Always fresh and hot with friendly staff. I do recommend"}
{"text":"The pizza tastes like cardboard. The place was dirty too when I visited this location. The staff was also rude and could not understand that I wanted the sauce on the side when I asked instead of on the pizza. So I left and went to Georgio's Oven Fresh Pizza Co. across the street on the corner of highland and Richmond by the marathon. The value, customer service, and pizza is way better and I enjoyed my experience here and will return. Not an overall good review for Little Caesar's though. :("}
{"text":"I would really like to post this with no stars as the visit is the worst experience I have ever had period. We all know little caesars is going downhill fast, but there is at least some sense of a standard that should still be met in product and in service and both have been lost on this location. I ordered 4 pizzas and they said it would be at least 15 minutes for the two sausage. I said well let me change that to two more pepperoni and they refused. I asked for a refund and they refused. The girl said \"well we already started making them\". Seriously? So, apparently there are no refunds at little Caesars anymore period or they just do not know how to do they just won't. Worst experience ever and I have been to some places that are pretty dang bad. Avoid this place at all cost! Since you won't get a refund."}

{"text":"This Little Caesars location is the closest one by my workplace. I have been contemplating swinging by after work to get dinner here, but this one is slightly off my route getting home.

I had spent several hours at Sherway Gardens. I did not feel like hitting the food court. Instead, I got into my car and placed my order over the phone for pick-up. The woman was friendly, but seemed stressed out. She asked me when I would arrive. I estimated fifteen minutes. She was good with that time.

It is in a strip mall next to a convenience store. I parked and walked in. No wonder she was so stressed. There were at least five people in there.

She was busying in the back with another employee, getting ton of pizzas ready. She finally took a deep breathe and said that things were crazy. I made her job easier by saying that I was the one who called for the $11 box set (you get Deep! Deep! pepperoni pizza and Italian cheesy bread) and honey garlic wings. I also got a bottled Diet Pepsi. It cost me $21, which is pretty good.

I brought my food back to the hotel. The pepperoni pizza was flavourful and you get perfect caramelization on the outside of the rectangle. The Italian cheesy bread was seasoned perfectly. I loved the garlic and butter combination. So good!

The wings were pretty tasty, too. I am not a huge fan of black pepper. It had some, but I was okay with it. The garlic and honey combination is my favourite. And, yes, I love garlic. Obviously, I am not a vampire.

I'd come back to this location again. I went in at around 15:30 when there was the NHL stadium series game between the Minnesota Wild and Chicago Blackhawks. I haven't watch an NHL hockey game on TV for ages. Bringing food back to the room to watch the whole game was perfect. I also have leftovers, which I love."}
{"text":"My manager told me about the $11 hot-and-ready box set. He explained that you get square deep!deep! pepperoni pizza slices and Italian-herbed cheese bread. 

He brought the latter to work. He was generous to share it with me. It was delicious!

Two hours later, I went to the closest Little Caesars store by work. It was -10°C at around 18:00. The plaza has plenty of parking. I parked in front of the Food Basics and walked into the pizza place, which was next door. 

I walked up to the counter and placed my order. I also bought a can of Crush cream soda. I waited for perhaps 15 minutes at the most. A combination of checking my e-mail on my phone, people-watching, and answering a call just before my order was ready kept me cheerful.  

I got into my car and continued talking to my boyfriend, who was calling me from Montreal. He was trying to get new key cards for his hotel, as he had lost his card to his hotel room. The pizza and Italian cheese bread smelled so good that I chowed down in my car as we talked. 

The pizza and cheese bread had caramelized edges that were crunchy and flavourful. The deep dish pizza was perfect. I loved the Italian cheese bread. Buttery goodness lingered in my mouth after I had finished eating. So good!

I had plenty of leftovers for days. I recommend ordering this deal. In the past, I have ordered the honey garlic wings, which are fabulous. 

If you are in a rush, I recommend calling your order in and then picking it up at the store. For me, I am rarely in a rush, so I'd come back and do the same next time."}
{"text":"I came here after I got my hair cut next door. I have been eyeing going to this Little Caesars location ever since my manager introduced me to the Hot-N-Ready box set. I ordered it again. It's just over $12 with taxes. 

I love the box set. It comes with pepperoni pizza and Italian cheesy bread. Yummy! The caramelized ion on the outside of everything is crazy good!

I tend to have leftovers. They are perfect for lunch. 

I ordered when I entered the store. The man working behind the counter there was kind and indicated that interior take 10-15 minutes. I sat there and my order was ready in 10 minutes. Impressive!

This location is the closest to where I live. I'll be back again!"}

{"text":"This joint hands down kicks pizza hut,dominoes, or papa johns in the behind so bad it isnt even funny. Some might say that the crust of a pizza determines the greatness. Mostly this statement in all of its falsehood is uttered by the female gender, and that is OK. However if your a male you would probably agree that its the toppings that make a pizza great. Guys how many times have you got a pizza and told yourself \" i wish I could have got back there and made it myself. Well you dont have to dream anymore if you patronize this particular L.C.'s.Toppings are very generous at this place, all you have to do is say\" heavy on the toppings\" when you call it in. The emp. that make the pizzas somehow always honor that request and still manage to keep their jobs. Since I started going to L.C.'s I have not patronized any other pizza joints. If the competition made their pizzas with as many toppings as this place the cost to you would be unfavorable for lack of a better word. The manager is very cool, its run by a man named Johnny, and he has assured speed,  accuracy and quality in hundreds of pizzas i have purchased from there. His employees never have an attitude and genuinly appear happy to be working. His best trait without a doubt is his friendlyness and that makes him very approachable so shout at him if you ever go in there."}
{"text":"I would like to put it out there first that the customer service here, well.. There isn't any. Worst service ever. 

I came in a few weeks ago & ordered a deep dish - stuffed crust because the photo they were advertising on the menu looked delicious. I went home to find that my take out was not stuffed which I payed extra for. I called the store after hours because they'd been close for half an hour already, and their manager said he'd give us a free one next time by just saying his name to the worker. 

I came in today asking for my free pizza as promised and the guy that was working in kitchen came out & was saying \"oh how do I know your pizza last time wasn't stuffed or if it was even a deep dish\" and crap like that. The cashier guy who also had to put his two cents in came from mopping the floor telling us \"you can just take two medium pizzas we can't make it. We ran out of \"stuffed crust\"\" 

First of all - how do you run out of stuffed crust 

& second of all your garbage pizza inside the heater was probably sitting there for over an hour. Pathetic. 

I then asked for a refund, but suddenly they didn't want to return the money & they have stuffed crust now so they'll make it. Lol, you guys are fucking lazy. It's 30 minutes till closing time, get it together when customers come in and want to order. 

Also try not to blame the customer that my deep dish from my previous order didn't have stuffed crust. I have photos to prove it. 

Lastly, the mopping cashier dude packed the pizza that was made and told my bf to look at the crust to tear it & check. 

And there was NO cheese. Then he kept pointing to other parts to tear, and still nothing. He then goes and says, \"Yeah, some customers get confused about the Picture\" and started laughing after my bf told him it doesn't look like the picture as advertised. 

I don't recommend little Cesar's. I haven't been to other locations but if that's what they call a stuffed crust then you're better off going to Pizza Hut for it. Stop false advertising.

Also. Wash your hands after you touch all that sanitizer you used to wipe down the tables. In the kitchen. I saw you pack my pizza with your grimy hands."}
{"text":"Worth the price. Fast and always ready. Pretty consistent in taste and freshness. If you want something other than pepperoni or cheese, call ahead and order. The deep dish is pretty good."}
{"text":"Just had guy working the window try to charge me $6.50 for a $5 pizza.  Hopefully he gets fired.  I didn't call for it, but I'm sure there are people that probably have."}
{"text":"My favorite Little Caesar's location! Great for when I need a last-minute dinner or a cheap lunch. The food is always very tasty, and if it's not ready right away(although it usually is ready), is always ready in less than 10 minutes. This will always be my go-to pizza joint in this area!"}

Was sooo looking forward to trying Little Caesar's new \"Deep Dish,\" ever since I first saw the ad a while back. I was super excited over the possibility of having a cheap Deep Dish option nearby (that wouldn't require me to drive to Hamilton!). Unfortunately, like most places advertising \"deep dish\" pizza, this was not really that at all.

What we had here was just a thicker (and too doughy) version of a regular crust, and did not appear to be authentic deep dish. Also, the topics were lacking, which this pizza really needed given the amount of bland crust. Not trying to hate on LC's here, as they did make an effort...but it just didn't make the grade. 

All this being said, the service at the counter was good - friendly, and took the time to tell us how long it would take to receive our food. They do also pop the pizza in the oven to keep it \"fresh.\""}
{"text":"I ordered a Crazy bread and Italian cheese pizza 
Specially their crazy bread is the best with the tomato sauce woww amazing! The only thing I don't like here you can,t seat and eat your food. But that's not from these guys. Anyways you must try out their amazing foods!"}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza!  Just what you've come to expect from Little Caesars. 

I purchased a Hot and Ready pepperoni pizza around 1:30 pm.  The service was quick, plenty of pizzas on hand for the walk in-s to be quick.

Pizza quality was as expected.  Dough was cooked through, cheese had the golden brown look to it and the overall taste was Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss.

You get what you pay for. 

This place always has a line. I ordered online this time. Little Caesars sent an email saying my pie would be ready in a box near the door. Of course, when I get there, the place is packed, line out the door, and the box my pizza should have been in is empty. 

I wait the ten minutes and get to the register. Tell the guy my order was online and my name. He goes and grabs my pizza from the back. It is buried under other orders. Rather than hand it to me, he takes it over to the box and places it in there. He tells me into key in my info. Now, I need to go back to my email and retrieve the number I need to key into the box so I can rescue my hostage pie.

While I am doing this, he is able to help the next two customers and they are out the door faster than I am. 

Woo!"}
{"text":"Owner is a greedy crook.

Supreme pizza is $8.50, hawaiian is $6.50. Ordered half hawaiian/half supreme. When I picked up the pizza, the owner charged $13.50 for an 8 dollar pizza. What kind of scam is the owner trying to run?! 

The d-bag owner tried to give some BS excuse that he doesn't do half/half on pizzas & instead doubles the toppings on each half of a single pizza. WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.

He then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?! You just made yourself look like an even more of an A-hole, dude.

How anyone believes they can get away with trying to rip people off in the age of the internet is beyond me.

P.S. I called 4 other Little Caesars franchises in the area and none of them charge 70% extra do a half/half pizza."}
{"text":"If food hell was a place, this would be it. I know that's pretty harsh, but I came to this place not because I love discount pizza, but because I was desperate and hungry. The first thing that accosted my soul was to walk in and an employee was loudly blowing his nose and staring longingly out of the window at god knows what. 
Strike 1: Gross.
Second, the cashier, who ABSOLUTELY did not want to be there picked his nails and flicked them off somewhere as he waited for us to give him the cash.
Strike 2: Why am I still here.
The pizza itself was not award winning, but what I had witnessed ruined the entire thing for me...if they do these things RIGHT IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS, I wonder what they do behind the scenes...
Just save your $5 and dig a pizza out of the trash."}
{"text":"Definitely the best little Caesars in this area. We've never had a burnt pizza or one with several bubbles - hardly any in fact. Little Caesars is known for their cheap decent tasting pizza, here however, it tastes great. It's generally fast service as can be expected. I always check the pizza before I leave though, the one time I didn't they gave me a cheese instead of a pepperoni, but the wife was actually happy it was cheese this time."}
{"text":"Over the past few years, I have rediscovered an appreciation for Little Caesars.  It's cheap, fresh, hot, and tastes better than other \"chain\" pizzas.  The real reason, I love Little Ceasars?  The DEEP DISH!  They never had this stuff back in the day when I was growing up.  I am extremely happy that they have it now, though!

I usually roll with their \"Lunch Combo\".  You get 4 big slices of deep dish pizza and a 20 oz bottle of Pepsi products for $5.00.  What, what?  Yes, you heard that right.  $5.00!  You can rarely find anything for $5.00 nowadays, and this deal gets you a big ass pizza, and a drink!  Score!  They have these \"hot and ready\" during the lunch hours, but I always call mine in and place my order over the phone so I know I'm getting a hot out of the oven pizza.  I usually order mine well done, too!  

The pizza is great! They cook these in little metal pans, so each of the 4 slices, is a corner slice.  The crust is crisp and buttery, the cheese is plentiful, and the sauce is tasty, too!  Surprisingly, the pizza isn't TOO greasy, which I appreciate. It's a damn fine lunch, and 4 slices really fill you up (you could probably split this with someone and still be satisfied)!

Overall, I really like this spot.  Service is friendly, prices are incredibly cheap, and the deep dish pizza is delicious.  Their regular pizza, meh, it's ok.  I never crave it.  This deep dish though?  Fantastic, and its one of my favorite pizzas anywhere, not just \"chain\" type pizza.  You owe it to yourself to head on down and pick one up!  Hope you like it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Well we all know Little Caesars has reasonable prices. In my opinion, the food is hit or miss. The last few times I have been, the dough was soggy which makes for a nasty pizza. Maybe they need to change the dough and/ or make it a tad bit thicker. Get your crap together Caesar's or loose a long time customer. On a good note, called and complained to the manager and she promised a free pie next visit."}
{"text":"They make delicious pizza here.  The crazy bread is delicious (ask for stuffed crazy bread if u can cuz it's better).  The staff is really friendly and u can see the people making the pizza.  Really, one of my favourite pizzarias ever."}
{"text":"The $5 Hot and Ready is a perfect meal for my family.  My kids are young and enjoy the simple pizza from Little Caesars.  Come on $5 for the family its a no brainer for a quick meal."}
{"text":"The naughty words were flying, employees saying they should go in the back quick to light one up, and a special sauce goes on the bread. Yes, this is what I heard and all the manager did, one time, when an employee came in to work, was a customer was waiting for food (he used the F word). 

Glad to know that the children kept up the language, quite nice to heard, especially when it's that/this loud. Oh yeah, was extremely nice to hear the staff talking about their sexual experiences they've recently had."}
{"text":"Ordered my food last week and when I went I asked three times if my pizza had xtra sauce , it was the lunch special . When I called I got Grant ( I think that's his name ) the assistant manager. He got on the phone and while I was talking set the phone down and walked away, came back to say that the preset was correct , when clearly it wasn't! Then did that they messed it up and he would re make it , but who has that time. As well as worry about what will happen to my pizza as he was yelling back at me and saying UGH to me .... so unprofessional! Said he would have the general manager call me , but one week later and still no call ! Sad to say but I've had many times that things are correct and just brished it off , but this time took the cak

Btw a update ! Still NO No response from anyone ! Guess they think they don't need good service ?"}
{"text":"I came in to take advantage of the free lunch combo promotional deal. There was a line outside with about a 20 minute wait. Unlike the store on Southern and Val Vista, this one allowed people to take advantage of the deal until 1pm as advertised. They gave vouchers out until 1pm to those in line but not able to claim the deal in time.
The pizza here is always good, today the customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"As  A former Employee at this exact Location. DO NOT ORDER THE DEEP DISH! The pans we used for the DEEP DISH was always covered in filth!! And when it was time to close up shop Jim the manager would complain that his employees were washing them and would make it harder to take the pizza out of the pan if the left over grease would be washed away so he INSIST that we did nothing. Yeah Good Job Jimmy."}
{"text":"I did not ask for mold with my pizza. But thats what I got! I tried calling multiple times but they won't answer. I will be calling corporate tomorrow."}
{"text":"I must say, the bf is right, little ceasar's is not that bad for their ready made deep dish pizza's. Yes, it is not Uno's deep dish worthy but it does settle your deep dish fix until you make it out to Chicago. They didn't have any ready when I walked it but it only took 10 minutes to whip up. For 8 bucks...its a lot of pizza...it takes us a few days to take it down. I'd go here if I don't have any time to pick up from Papa John's or Liberetto's. This location is in the corner of the Walmar complex on Wilkinson next to the Gamestop. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pizza had been sitting in the hot box for some time. The cheese wasn't even stringy anymore. I had to reheat it to get the cheese melted again."}
{"text":"At this location, there is one of the most friendly and polite cashiers I've met. Called me Miss, thanked me for my order and had a big smile and a happy demeanor. 9 staff working quickly and swiftly to service a long line of people. Kitchen looks clean and absent of clutter. Not gonna lie, Little Ceasars pizza isn't the most amazing culinary experience in the world lol, but for the price and fast service, can't complain. Ordered 3 Hot-n-Ready $11 box sets. Will feed tons of people for very little money."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. You really get what you pay for. That $5 \"hot and fresh\" pizza was neither hot or fresh. It was hot when I left the store. I got home 5 minutes later and it was a brick. Crust is disgusting and cheap. Employee was eating while he took my order and money. Just an all around bad experience. WOULD NOT RETURN."}
{"text":"Here's a Hot-N-Ready fact for you:  Little Caesars is the third-largest pizza chain in the United States, behind Domino's and Pizza Hut.

Okay, this review is mainly for me because I keep buying the same disappointing chicken wings over and over again.  STOP BUYING THE WINGS! They're tiny, not-breaded, and soggy from being drowned in the sauce 

Anyways, while this isn't my favorite pizza joint, not even for fast food pizza [that title goes to the place across the street with the initials of P.H.], they're cheap, they open late, and you can buy a decent 'za for $6-$9.  I've been gravitating towards their Extra Most Bestest and their Deep! Deep! Dish!  They get the job done.  I also like their \"Crazy Combo\" for their breadsticks.  Although half the time, they forget to give me the marinara sauce even though I pay for it.

This Little Caesars is recently remodeled with fast and efficient workers.  I wish they would just remember to give me my dang marinara sauce!"}
{"text":"Wasn't greeted when I walked in. Took employee several minutes to acknowledge me and take my order. They were out of crazy bread (the only thing I went there for). She didn't make any other suggestions for what I could get. Just walked out."}
{"text":"If I was able to give it 0 stars, I  would. The employees are awful. I tried to called to get a pizza, since they never have ready pizza. I also wanted a special one, which you have to order. I called and they answered, but said nothing. I said hello, they said hello and hung up. Then they would not answer my calls afterwards. It's not like the pizzas are good to begin with, they're simply inexpensive. I've called in before for 6 pizzas (for a party) and when I arrived they went \"oh, she came.\" Yes? That is why I ordered. I even arrived later than I told them to make sure they were ready. They claimed to be busy, yet making the 6 \"ready to go\" pizzas would have been a bad choice? Very poorly managed, and I will more than likely not be purchasing from this location again."}
{"text":"They really do give you lots of pepperoni which is great. Taste was average; nothing to complain or write home about on this one. Unfortunately, the second pizza was the wrong order. They offered to remake it but the wait was too long. I may try them again but no time soon."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. The employees refused to actually make the food.
Then she flirted with the cook for 10 mins while I waited for my change."}
{"text":"I was driving past here and noticed that it just opened so I made a mental note to check it out sometime. So I was coming home one night and I remember that I forgot to leave something out for dinner so I thought let's give this place a try. It's not to be confused with gourmet pizza but for $5 it's hard to go wrong. I had the pepperoni and it was ok. It was cool that it was ready so quickly. If you're looking for a quick bite give it a try."}
{"text":"I have visited numerous Little Caesar's pizza joints and this one is absolutely the best by far. Employees are friendly, inside is clean and the pizza is better than other Little Caesar's. It's cooked perfectly and all the toppings including the cheese, is fresh and generous! Way more than others. Usually my friends/family leave the crust but not here. This one definitely can compete with Dominoes, Pizza Hut or Papa John's at less than half the price to boot! Try it you'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"Do not come here. Terrible experiences all the time. Hot-and-ready my ass. The only thing that seems to be ready here is the soda in the cooler or the ranch dressing. Seriously, everything on the menu that says hot-and-ready has NEVER been available except the generic 5 dollar pizzas (on occasion).

Final nail in the coffin came tonight. Was told that I would need to wait 10 minutes. Fine. An employee after 20-25 minutes asked me what I was waiting for. When I let them know they informed me that they gave it away to another customer. Fine. I was told it would come out in about 10 minutes.  

Brought the pie home and after biting into it...raw dough. Fuck. Put it in the oven when we got home and gave up on the experiment. The rest will go in the garbage and be transported to a landfill. I would assume the one out in Gilbert.

Called up the store to tell them the situation and spoke with a manager. Informed him of the raw state of the dough. He did offer to remake the pizza for me, but I wasn't driving back. I had already spent 45 minutes waiting for an under cooked pizza, imagine how long it would take for a finished one.

Being in the spirit of Christmas, we rewrote a Christmas song for this store, as sadly I can no longer endure our relationship together seeing as you no longer care about my feelings.  I am only out 8 bucks for the experience, so life will go on. It will not go on with this locations food for me. Sung to the tune of \"I'll be home for Christmas\"  Cue the band...

I'll be home with pizza
If only in my dreams!"}
{"text":"So I always pass this little caesar location. So finally I went there 3 days ago.
I went there just before 8pm. I wanna try their new promo half pepperoni and half bread.
Didn't have anything ready gotta wait 10 minutes. Then the employees look really young and stressed out.
I went back the day after at noon... same thing gotta wait. Not impressed. Talked to the owner and he is really awful.  
He says he ends up throwing the pizza away if he makes ahead...I wonder why...he doesn't know customer service.
I went back today ordered crazy bread. Still gotta wait. 3 strikes your out! 
The way he talks to his customers are so unprofessional. Know it all. Customer is always right. He argues with his customers.  The 1 customer said oh in southland location they have it ready.  The owner was like coz they are busier and bigger location. We end up throwing pizza away. This is at lunch time! What a lame excuse. I can see that logic maybe mid afternoon....but use that excuse on lunch time....illogical.
No more going to that place. Hot and ready.....NOT!
The only time it is 4 to 8pm. Even then when I went there at 745pm it wasn't ready."}
{"text":"$5 or $6 for a large pizza!

How can they make any money selling the pizza that cheap?

It is certainly not gourmet pizza but you don't pay $20 for the pizza either.

Always fast service and pizza is warm and ready on the spot.

Good and fast for the money. The Pretzel Crust pizza is good and if you like salt on your pretzel you will like it more"}
{"text":"On the whole, the pizzas are good. Yeah, for $5 and change, they're good. 

I see some reviewers were critical of the store for not having pizza ready when they get in. It's happened to me a couple of times, and yes, it's kind of annoying. At five bucks, I won't complain. You can order a pizza in advance if you'd like. 

The salads, however, are priced kind of high, and a couple of times I ended up with wilted, slimy, and or brown lettuce (the owner or employees just trying to increase the shelf life and minimize waste). If you get a fresh salad, they're worth it. If you don't--right in the trash. I've gotten a bad salad too many times to want to gamble on them anymore. Pizza is still good though. 

PS--some of the people working there are sharp and on the ball, but some of the HS kids seem pretty out of it. The service they provide is fine--they just seem disinterested, lethargic, and mellow (a little too mellow sometimes or maybe everyone in HS is like that). Going back to what I noted earlier...the pizza is just five bucks, so I won't complain :)"}
