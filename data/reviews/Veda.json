{"text":"Working around Yonge and Bloor and being to lazy to prepare my own lunch I am always on the hunt for new lunch places.  Veda provides me with an affordable, healthy and unique choice that I often endulge in.  

For 5.50 you can get a rice bowl with two curries which is certainly enough to satisfy most people.  On days when I am extra hungry I get the large for a few bucks more and I have never been more stuffed.  Overall a great place but some people get turned off by the healthy factor."}
{"text":"i really should love places that want to serve healthy food.  but i'm really not sure what makes this place ayurvedic, there is no hint of healthy or medicinal as far as i can tell.  maybe healthy means less spice?  i really want to love this place, i really really want to but i just can't get into the food.  bland i can live with but even the chickpeas were a little undercooked and al dente.

sorry veda, but i'm being real generous with 2 stars.  you get the extra points for wanting people to be healthy."}
{"text":"ok, I almost gave this three stars but demoted it to two just because yo uknow what?  I HAVE experienced better.  Just not better in the village area.  

I got delivery because a bunch of my friends are vegetarians and it;s one of those menues that are fairly easy for that.  It was a slightly overpriced, considering I know how much real indian food costs.  And the quality was average, at best slightly above average.  If you are totally craving Indian and don't want to drag yourself to little india this place is fine, but if you don't mind going ona little adventure then definitely skip this place for some authentic stuff.

I ordered the meal for 2 and it was 44$ dollars including tip (no delivery charge but you should still tip).
And it came out to two large meals for me and my friend.  So 10$/meal ain't bad, but you could also get that experience in an awesome little hut in little india where you could smell the amazing spices and get the dining experience.

This is a very mediocre choice for the area and I'd say skip it.  the only way they could save themselves is if they slashed the prices by 50%"}
{"text":"My experience with Veda was purely take-out, so cannot comment on the dining experience. Overall it was very good indian food and most importantly HEALTHY. Being Indian myself, I enjoy my mom's home cooked meals, and for the most part they are healthy. But I tend to avoid Indian restaurants because the meals can be so HEAVY. (especially Indian buffets, they had a great *Epic Meals episode using Indian buffet food...)

Here is the rundown:

1. Service: excellent take-out service. Our food was delivered warm and on-time. They did provide us with some cutlery and napkins. Everything was individually wrapped and minimal spillage occurred during the delivery process.

2. Food: Great taste! To be honest I didnt even know it was healthy indian food' until someone in my group passed the menu over to me. Prior to that I kept eating away, wondering why I wasn't getting that heavy 'oh I ate too much and now I need a nap' feeling. To summarize our food choices we had basmati rice (fluffy and soft), naan (the only part of the meal I didnt love, they were a bit rubbery), butter chicken/curry chicken/chickpea curry/mixed vegetable curry -all really tasty. The flavours were distinct, but not overpowering. The spice level was moderate, you could comfortably enjoy your meal without needing a yogurt dish or large glass of water beside your plate.

This is a great healthy option! I would recommend the take-out service for work functions/larger groups. With the vegetarian options and low-spiceyness level, Veda Indian take-out is a crowd pleaser.

*For those unaware Epic Meals is a crazy you-tube show where they made giant calorie-laden meals (ie. 'Epic Meals') that makes Supersize me look like a diet movie...."}
{"text":"This place is so gross and should be ashamed to call itself Indian food in a city that knows how to do Indian food. The butter chicken was gross and not even real chicken! It was a processed block that was cut into cubes. So gross and definitely a lie when you claim you have healthy Indian food. Other Indian places that may use more fat to cook with actually use real chicken, so if your idea of healthy is fat-free processed chicken cubes, then cool, but if real food is healthy to you, go to any other Indian joint than this."}
{"text":"One of Veda's biggest selling points for me has always been its front patio. Regardless of how much I love eating Indian food, smelling like it for the rest of the day is quite another thing all together. However, chillin' on the patio with an icy lassi would take on a whole new meaning now that the temperatures have dropped so significantly.

Worry not though, there's yet another reason still to visit Veda the rest of the year: butter tofu. Regardless of whether you're vegetarian or am just into alternative options (vs. paneer or chicken), this dish is possibly the only example of anything at Veda that is near worthy of it's claim to be healthy. It's healthier, at the least!

One choice of curry and a choice of veg with either plain basmati or spinach basmati will cost you $7.25. With a vibrant orange and white theme, the interior is extremely bright. I've dined in several times and it seems that take away is the norm, leaving plenty of seating for those of us who need to get our masala on right then and there."}
{"text":"Looking for a light lunch, I dropped into Veda around 12:30pm on a Friday.  There were 3 people ahead of me in line.  Behind the counter, one employee working feverishly to fill customer orders and work the cash register.  I watched as she slowly prepared each order and then finally, it was my turn.

I ordered 2 samosas - a veggie and a beef, and a small tamarind dipping sauce.  Total came out neatly to $3.00.  Oh but the wait continued as after I placed my ordered, the employee put my 2 samosas into a toaster oven to heat.

I think it took almost 15-20 min. before I walked out with my order.  My god...next time I might phone in my order beforehand!

I have had their lunch entrees before - small (one item with rice - $4.99) and large (2 items with rice - $6.99).  But I fear how long the wait will be if I actually order a meal and not just a snack.

The samosas are baked, not fried and they are tasty...not sure if it was worth the wait though."}
