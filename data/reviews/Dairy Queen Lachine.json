{"text":"Service is great! The Best Dairy Queen! Staff is friendly and kind! Parking is easy or just biking by to stop in with easy access."}
{"text":"This is a tired old Dairy Queen with zero curb appeal, dirty, smells, and the ice cream is basic at best. Look a bit farther if you want something decent."}
{"text":"Depuis que je suis petite, j'adore ce Dairy Queen en particulier, car il implique aussi une petite marche sur le bord de l'eau tout en mangeant le dessert! :)"}
{"text":"Well it's Dairy Queens, always happy to get ice cream :D"}
{"text":"Ok its July, its hot , any ice cream would pretty much hit the spot at any given time. After watching a DQ commercial on tv on their Royal Blizzard I just had to run out and get one, DQ not being so far away from me also has its perks. The service was surpisingly fast and they gave me lots of cheese cake fillings. Yep!  I got me a Royal cheese cake blizzard, I go what the heart and tummy wants."}
{"text":"Great spot along Lakeshore to stop and grab a cone. A little expensive for what you get but my son enjoys it and we get to walk around a great spot."}
{"text":"J'aime bien se Dairy Queen la assez proche de chez moi toujours un bon service crème glacé très bonne"}
