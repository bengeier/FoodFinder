{"text":"Nice shop, good service but if you are going here for an Italian sandwhich don't bother. I've had much better at many grocery stores hot tables. FYI the sandwiches are about 1/3 the size of a California sandwich as far as meat and toppings go. The deserts did look good and the menu seems interesting, maybe I ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Driving from Oshawa to Markham, the Mrs. and I were hungry. Found this cute little Italian deli on the way so we decided to stop.   First impression was that the place is relatively new and super clean. Good design all around with a red and white theme throughout.   Seat for approximately 12. Two counters. One featuring hot food and the other scrumptious looking desserts.   Hot food includes lasagne, veggies, rice balls, sausage, Alfredo and a bunch of other yummy looking food.   We ordered the lasagne and rice ball. The lasagne was excellent. Beef with about 12 layers of pasta, cheese and sauce. It really tasted homemade. The rice ball was also fantastic. Excellent texture served at the right temperature.   The staff were friendly and helpful informing us that there was no soup on our visit and that pizza was only available in the evenings (just a heads up).   All in all a great eating experience.   Bon appetite."}
{"text":"I love that it's down the street from my house. It's easy to overlook since it's part of a small strip mall to the side of the road. I only started noticing it because I walk by with my dog every day. Finally gave it a try and the most authentic Italian food in Brooklin. Been to a few other \"Italian\" food places in the Durham region and it tastes like it's just something from the frozen food isles. This includes travelling all the way to Ajax to Il Fornello. My husband and I like coming here when we want to eat out and are sick of chain restaurants or generic food. The only reason we don't eat here all the time is because we don't want to get fat."}
