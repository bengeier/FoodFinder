{"text":"Just had a sausage pizza last week! Delicious! Been visiting this place since it was Tiffe's Pizza back in the day. Have yet to have a bad experience in all my years. Prices are still good and quality is top notch. Don't live nearby any longer but when I'm in the area it is always a stop I have to make!"}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town 3 months ago. I'm not even a huge fan of pizza, but I crave this stuff! ! Their pizza is by far the best pizza in the area!  The sizes run on the smaller side but they make that up with heaping toppings!  They even have to go beer!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Used them to cater my children's baptism and everything was wonderful! They came and set up plus brought the pop and beer. Very reasonable for wonderful HOME COOKED food! Our guests raved about it!"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to pizza parlor for a couple years now.  They have a great special that they run all year for about $25 that includes 2 pizzas, an order of wings, and a 2 liter.  Love their food and the family atmosphere ... even tried a couple of their home-made pies and they were delicious.  If the Indians are playing you can count on hearing/seeing glimpses of the game.  They don't have a fancy dining room but they deliver on everything I could ask for when my family is in the mood for pizza.  Thumbs up from me ... try them out, you won't be disappointed.  Their slogan \"ridiculously delicious\" is on point ... I love this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. Not a favorite. The Don pizza extra lg was under cooked  toward the center. The meatball topping was hard and tasted old and dried up. Peppers and onions are cut big, which is OK if you like lg chucks of crunchy veggies. It was supposed to have sausage but I didn't see any. The dough was browned on the bottom, almost too much considering the points were floppy and raw-ish and it was a dry salty texture. The slices were cut very unevenly. We also tried the wings which were big and meaty but they are not cooked to a crispy skin its a rubbery skin. The two sauces we tried teriyaki was tasty and a light brown and the garlic butter was good too. Both were extremely mild. Probably won't be back. Lots of better choices in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the area. Not too greasy. The right amount of sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"The saltiest pizza I have ever eaten. Bought a large pepperoni pizza and my girlfriend and I had one piece each. It is tough for me to dislike a pizza, this is nearly inedible."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places! They have great pizza and wings and it's more reasonably priced than most other places. Paisano's represents one of the best values in town!

They also have very good pasta and sandwiches. Plus, during lent, they have a very reasonably priced all you can eat fish fry ($7.99 - Dine In Only).

The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that I was unaware that their large pizzas are most other places medium size and the restaurant doesn't have air conditioning."}
{"text":"Best traditional pizza in this area! I would give 5 stars if they had a better dining room. We order from there at least once/twice a month!"}
{"text":"This place was by far, the best pizza joint I ever went to.  I used to go regularly, for about 4 years straight.  I even would buy it to bring to parties and everyone always loved it.  Then about 3 or 4 years ago something happened.  I don't know if it was new management, or new owners (I once asked the man that was working at the oven...and he wasn't very clear with his answer) but the people working in there had changed...and the pizza....well...it changed too....for the worst.  I've bought pizza there around 3 or 4 times since this change and most recently tried it again the other night...what a disaster.  It was bad as I remember trying it last around a year and a half ago.  Sauce is non-existent, cheese layer is so thin...they may as not even put any on, crust is terrible....thin and soggy, and you could literally tip it to the side to let the grease roll off.  I would love to  know what spices they use....because there is one they put on...that I remember from the last couple of awful pizzas I had there....that is sickening (I don't want to speculate....but cinnamon maybe???)
I am only writing this for those of you who may remember the good old days when this pizza rivaled the Antonio's of old and PJ's of today.  If that's what you think you're going to get if you go back...you have been warned."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place with my father, since I was literally 5 years old. I have had only one bad service throughout those 16 years. This place gets a new owner every few years. Long story short, years ago there was this owner who was such a douchebag; it, stopped me, my father, family, and friends; from ever returning. Fast forward 6-7 years (present day), and I decide to check this place out once more. This new owner has been here for 4 years, and is an awesome guy with a fantastic attitude. 

This was my family's go-to pizza place as a child, and I can confidently say that it's our go-to pizza place once again. The pizza is flawless, wings fantastic. There Chicken Parmesan I can say without a doubt, is the best Chicken Parmesan I have ever tried. I've been here every other week for the last two months, and haven't looked at an Antonio's, Pizza Hut, Marcos, etc since."}
