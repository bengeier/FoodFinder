{"text":"Nana's Porch catered a rehearsal dinner I attended and the food was amazing! The food came out quickly and exceeded our exceptions. YUM!"}
{"text":"Found this great food truck out in Concord at Twenty Six Acres Brewery.  I went with the Barnyard Burger.  The large patty has pulled pork, caramelized onions and pimento cheese.  I added bacon jam.  It was great tasting and cooked perfect.   The side of fries were perfectly crispy and  delish.   I tried an order of fried mac n cheese.   It was good, but not enough cheese for my taste.     Just so you know, the burger is messy!   My hands, face and table were a mess.  The burg fell apart!!!!  No worries, dump a bunch of ketchup on top, quick stir and I had redneck poutine - I then used the mac n cheese as a scooper!   I was in pure delight.     The father in law and gal that cook are great and want to please!   Feedback is encouraged!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fun attitude. I had a great experience tonight with Nana's at D9 brewery. The two people running the truck tonight were up beat, down to earth, and funny. All good in my book. The uptown cheese steak was delicious as well as the brisket tacos.  Will eat here again for sure!!"}
