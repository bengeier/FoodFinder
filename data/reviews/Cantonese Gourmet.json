{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never had any issues with service or food. Staff can be aloof and quiet, but I wouldn't go so far as to say rude. My order has always been correct, hot, and tasty. The dining area is small and not suited to large groups. I'd suggest takeout strongly."}
{"text":"My husband bit into it (3 bites in) and there was hair... Definitely not mine because my hair is up and I haven't even been close to his. I was supposed to get a spring roll with my combo which disappointingly didn't  get. We've been going here for awhile now but will stop."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant many times before and never had any concerns or issues. This time however my order came to me completely wrong and I called asking for the right order to be delivered. I was yelled at over the phone and told that it was my fault. The employee proceeded to tell me they would deliver the correct order to me, upon arriving with my new order the delivery person started yelling at me and making me feel completely unsafe with his tone. He was yelling how it was my fault and that I am \"dumb\". I cannot believe that this type of customer service is what they thought would be appropriate to give to a long time customer.  I DO NOT recommend Cantonese gourmet to anyone unless they are looking to have an argument with the staff there, or looking for something completely different than what they ordered. I am completely baffled with what just happened and I can guarantee I or any of my friends will never order from them again. If there was a zero star option or even below that I would have awarded it before I give the one star."}
