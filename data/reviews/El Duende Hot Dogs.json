{"text":"Awesome hot dogs, I ordered 5 and they were bomb!!! Plus they have a lot of additional toppings that you can add to your hot dog. I'll be there very often."}
{"text":"The hot dogs have good flavor and the frijoles charros are very good. The service is good and the servers were attentive and answered all our questions. What is keeping this place from being a 5star? I thought the bacon was undercooked and they had little mayo on the buns. Bacon needs more cooking for sure. I enjoy eating hot dogs so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally a place close to home that sells this type of food. Decided to check it out and get some Sonoran style Hot Dogs they were bomb. Prices are reasonable. Took my order to go because it's way too hot outside for me. We still got a little cup of frijoles charros while we waited which is a nice customer service touch. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Can't wait for El Duende to come back. Their hot dogs are great! My wife and I tried each hot dog and our favorite one was the \"El Duende\" hot dog. Great prices as well. We're excited to try their new items once they're open."}
{"text":"The only Mexican hotdog stand in Buckeye , hotdogs are very delicious . 
Hope they last here in B-Town . I've seen a few here in town through out the years but don't last very long. Hope this one is here to stay for a good while.  The sonora hotdog is the best. The crew is respectful and there always make sure you are taking care of when your there eating.  I  Definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Their hotdogs are amazingly good, reasonable prices and great service! I reccomend the sonoran hotdogs with a Mexican coke. Cant go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs ! Really good Service & all i recommend ! Lots of different options , snacks & more always good to get a cold coca cola from the bottle is a plus."}
{"text":"Well I went here about a week ago with my girlfriend, I've had some good sonaran dogs , but I cannot say this is one of them, the bun wasn't right, and tasted like a bar-s hotdog wrapped in bar-s bacon, I just moved here and wanted so bad for them to be good, but I wasn't impressed, won't go back"}
{"text":"I came here one time for hot cheeto elote. Which was delish. I ordered 2 sonoran dogs as well. They were tasty. My problem was with the person who took my order. She was eating hot Cheetos,  her fingers and teeth were red. She licked them clean and then took my order. That was unappetizing. She wasnt the one who prepared the food but I was still put off. They were super friendly."}
{"text":"This place was not very good the bread used for the hot dogs was the worst even cheap and the hot dogs didn't taste like they were all beef or look all beef my boyfriend and I got 2 each we had to force the second one down I love me a good Sonoran dog, this was not one"}
{"text":"Super good! Craved it while I was pregnant! However the past few times these past two months, my boyfriend has gone to pick it up and he says that the staff is rude. The first time we figured everyone has a bad day but the second time he came back and said the same thing. Sad bc the hotdogs are well worth it, but if we go back again and have the same experience we probably won't go back after."}
{"text":"The hotdogs are outstanding!!!! Service is great and price is very affordable. Love the Sonoran hotdogs!"}
