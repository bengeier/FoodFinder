{"text":"Soulful Chinese Beijing food. Pork pancakes are amazing along with fried potato the noodles and side dishes. Very affordable and cheap but this isn't the most English friendly restaurant"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service! Not recommanded.
I know this store by friends, but it turns out to be a big disppiontment. The meat pies are just so-so, and they dont even have a waiter. The manager has a terrible attitude,making phone when i was ordering. She doesnt even give me the recipt, which i guess is to avoid tax.
Anyway, the moderate food doesnot worth putting up with horrible service."}
{"text":"A lovely little Beijing style chinese food, specializing in meat pancakes.  My wife is from Beijing and she definitely confirms that this place is as authentic as it gets.

Cold veggie dishes are lightly seasoned and very refreshing using very fresh ingredients.  Meat pancakes are lovely flavoured, thin tasty skins.  Noodles are cooked perfectly and soup is rich and complex.  Highlight is the sesame paste pancake.  Small menu and not many tables, but turnover is quick so come for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I was craving for noodle soup but not pho, and this place is quiet, clean and has good food! Must try their lamb pancake. Their style is northern Chinese food but not as heavy as some traditional shops (which I don't really like). 

Their spicy beef noddle and pork belly noodle are very flavorful, a lot of meat! Service is so so as you can expect at (most) Asian restaurants, but they will bring things over (napkins, water extra cutlery) if you ask for them."}
{"text":"I think this is an excellent place to go for lunch, due to its small menu.Obviously I ordered the meat pancakes, which were really delicious. However I find that it is better to let it cool a bit, because when it's piping hot, it's hard to enjoy the flavour of the meat inside. I also ordered the fried sweet potato dish, which was also really delicious and unique, since I've never had that dish before. Overall, I found this restaurant really enjoyable, and my mom also found the dishes like the congee (which is different from Cantonese congee and may be an acquired taste) to be reminiscent of my grandmother's cooking since she was from Beijing as well. Furthermore, all dishes are really affordable with a decent portion size which made things all the better. I'm not sure if this would be a good place for dinner though, cause I'm not sure if they would offer a bigger menu at night. Also, for those who read Chinese (not me =[ ) there are also extra items on the walls. Overall, I found my experience here pretty good, and will surely return for lunch, or maybe just for a snack!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times already but i always forget to do a review!!

Anyway,I absolutely love LA mere !! I tried their pork bone noodles , cold tofu with green onion ,lamb kabobs , spicy cold noodles, spicy tripe , beef pancake and just the pork bone dish 

 They were all really really good ~ it's cheap too!!

The flavors are all amazing if you like spicy and cold !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for lamb lovers. Several dishes with strong lamb taste. We got:
-toothpick cumin lamb, which was great. The pieces are actually quite big and tasty
-lamb noodle soup. Noodles are good, and broth had a strong lamby taste. Awesome. Only complaint is some of the lamb pieces are fatty 
-lamb pancakes: again good stuff 

-also tried a sesame peanut butter pancake for desert that was tasty. Reminded me of nutter butters. 


Big parking lot shared by rest of strip mall"}
{"text":"This is the second location of La Mere, an authentic Northern Chinese (Beijing cuisine to be exact) street-food / comfort food style place with a French name (weird much?).  Compared to its original location at Finch and Midland, this place is slightly bigger with 8 tables and just as simply decorated.  

Their meat pies are awesome.  Each order is a large rectangular minced meat patty deftly flavoured with umani and spices, wrapped in a thin roti-like pancake and pan fried to perfect crunchiness on the outside.  You can choose from beef, pork, or lamb fillings.  Yum!

I also love the dessert version pie which is #301 Sesame & peanut butter pancake.  It looks just like the meat pie, i.e., rectangular and with a crunchy skin on the outside, as you bite down be careful of the molten sesame-PB filling that will ooze out.  I almost burned myself taking too big a bite.  

Solid 3.5 stars.  I will be back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Super salty food and negative service, would not recommend"}
{"text":"This place definitely has a Beijing styled and cooked menu. I had many dishes; the pan fried pork pancake had a decent flavour and price. The pork noodle soup was average, but the lamb noodle soup was amazing. Just the right amount of spice, great flavour, and they weren't skimpy of the lamb portion."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and there isn't one time that has disappointed me.  It isn't easy to keep the food quality consistent, but this place does.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First off, I must disclose that I have never been to Beijing, so I trust and depend on the opinion of other reviewers that the food here is authentic Beijing.  

For this evening, we ordered a beef meat patty, a cabbage dish and a lamb soup noodle.  Everything seemed so simple: simple ingredients, simple presentation.  Yet, the flavours were well balanced.  The portion was average.  The services was friendly.  The prices were low.

To me, the beauty of the food at La Mere is in the cooking techniques.  The dishes at times taste bold and in your face (goat soup noodle), while at times they taste delicate (cabbage dish).  At least for this meal, all the dishes were cooked just right: nothing was too burnt/crunchy/dry, rich flavours were not overwhelmingly oily/salty/spicy.  The chefs are the stars of this little joint indeed.

Even so, it strikes me that the menu at La Mere are more local street flavours.  It doesn't seem to reflect the history, statue and glamour of Beijing being the capital of China for centuries."}
{"text":"Despite the confusing name, this restaurant is doesn't serve any French cuisine!! It is actually Northwestern Chinese restaurant.

This isn't one of those \"hip\" restaurants. We only came to try this place out because it was Saturday night at 7 and my group of 8 didn't make any reservations for any restaurants. OMG I can totally surprised by the price. Most of its dishes are under $10, even for many dishes featuring lamb, what a steal. 

Overall the food was pretty good and they came out really fast. Their house special meat pancakes tasted average for me however. But hey, can't beat the price. We ordered 11 dishes in total and the bill came down to $18 per person before tips. Not bad for dinner in a large group."}
{"text":"The place is very small and seems like its always busy. 
Its a great place to eat some fresh noodles. 

Got the porkbone with noodles - the only complaint is that the porkbone were mostly bone and very little meat. Had to take my chopsticks to really dig out the meat and my hand was really sore from all the digging of the meat. Noodles have great texture and a huge difference from packaged noodles. The beef noodles were just as good and beef was sliced super thin. 

The beef pancake was a good side snack. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Goes well with pepper oil however the pepper oil they have on the table looked so dirty that I didn't feel like using it. In the end I still ended up using it.

Low cost and filling meal"}
{"text":"3.5/5

When I went to Japanese Ramen King the first time around, I noticed this restaurant which was quite busy. Looking at the menu, I decided to give this place a try some other time, which ended up being this past week.

First thing to note, this is a Mandarin speaking restaurant. The employees do not know Cantonese (at least the ones I dealt with that day), and their English knowledge is limited to acceptable. However I did notice they gave preferential treatment to ones who can communicate with them, which was a poor sign for people like myself.

This is a Northern-style Chinese restaurant, so don't expect dim sum here. I ordered the Peking style meat pie and a beef noodle soup. I was also looking at the pork bone noodle soup and the pork noodle soup, but opted to go with beef for my first visit.

I liked the meat pie a lot: Crispy, yet soft at the same time, just the way I like it. There was also a good amount of pork meat in there. For the noodles, I liked the noodle and the beef slices, but the broth was a little on the plain side. I suppose it's meant to be not as oily as other places, but it's definitely not something I'm used to.

For $12 after taxes this dinner meal was definitely a steal. I left the restaurant completely stuffed and had to walk it off a bit before driving away.

With practically all Chinese restaurants, food trumps service. Using that theory I will return for future visits."}
{"text":"I love the meat pancakes from this place. A really thin crepe like exterior is filled with delicious beef. It has just the right amount of spice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this home style Northern Chinese restaurant.
 I've been a patron at the Scarborough location for years and is glad to see them more uptown. 
Their specialty meat pastries are great, but I actually don't find them very memorable and make me go back for more.
The version that has the pastry dough cut up and stir fried like a fried noodle however, is really good. The pastry strips adds a lot of character to your regular fried noodle that's done perfectly.
Aside from their specialty meat filled pastries, I really enjoyed their soup noodles. The texture is perfectly chewy and the inconsistent thickness makes it very interesting and rustic.
Another thing that actually would actively make me go back is their sweet sesame pastry! In my opinion, way better than the meat ones.

It's not the most unique and best place for this cuisine but at these prices, it'll be one of my go tos."}
{"text":"First off, La Mere has opened a NEW location on Highway 7 in Richmond Hill - congratulations!

I've been back a many times at this Scarborough location, and they are always busy - even on a random Tuesday night this week! Again, recommended for small groups of 2-6 ppl. Unfortunately, they don't take any large group reservations :(

They now have a new fancy menu with colourful photos, and still offering the same food items (I prefer the old menu design better, mainly because I memorized where all the items are lol!) 

I'm still very happy with their food (service.... not so much but I don't blame the woman, she is working her butt off by herself! She is very quick on her feet.) I would highly recommend the following:

1. Marinated pork bones - MUST order!!
2. Marinated pig stomach with cilantro - *spicy*
3. Shredded potato salad - very crunchy
4. Stuffed beef/pork/lamb meat pancake
5. Spicy lamb meat on toothpicks
6. Sweet potato balls with red bean paste filling
7. Glutinous rice balls in sweet light wine soup

One more thing to note: I never really liked their noodle soup dishes... tried it a few times. I like the fact that the noodles are chewy (+1) but the soup base is very off for me. Maybe that is how it should taste like (?) but I'm not a fan, sorry! Everything else on the menu is delicious! Definitely a place I will frequent often :) Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We went here as Mona came back for a quick visit!!! A bit skeptical at first as people expected this to be a \"french\" restaurant! We ordered quite a few dishes like pork bone, pork pancake, spicy noodle, chive and egg pancake, stir fry flat bread etc. and they were all great! I would definitely come back to try more!"}
{"text":"La Mere is NOT a French Restaurant... and it has nothing French about it!! 

La Mere is just the Northern Chinese restaurant doing small plates. It's Chinese name means \"Old Mother Meat Cake\". Since it is their specialities I decided to try one of those.

Stuffed Beef Pancake ($4.50) took a little while to arrive as it was made to order. The beef was minced and it was juicy and savoury. It was filling too!! I ordered a congee ($1) to go with the pancake and it made a really authentic Northern Chinese cuisine experience!

La Mere is really a single friendly restaurant because all their dishes are smaller portion at a cheaper price point! That's why there were at least another 3 singles eating in the restaurant while I was there!!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food at La Mere in Scarborough and I am excited they open another location in Richmond Hill.

Of course, I highly recommend their Signature Pie. All made to order, serves pipping hot! But there are also other dishes worth trying and all the cooking just like something a mother would have prepare at home....

???($5.50) Beef Meat pie - Juicy and delicious!
???($1) Millet Rice Congee - A healthy option for carb
????($5.50) Cold Noodle w/Spicy Sauce - homemade noodle cooked al dente with great bite
??????? ($4.99) Wonton in Chicken Soup - the soup garnish with seaweed is just so good.. and love the bite size wonton
??????($8.99)  Beef Tendons w/Soy Sauce - beef is tender and the dipping sauce is quite interesting: sour and garlicky
??????? ($4.99) Dried Shrimp and Fried Cabbage - tons of baby shrimps that add unique flavour to this simple dish
??????? ($3.50) Traditional Peking Assorted Dried Fruits & Nuts Paste Dessert - meh, baby food texture... 
????? ($4.99) Sesame Peanut Butter Pancake - so hot, so fresh, so crispy... yummmmy

Almost all dish are under $10! Chinese style tapas great for sharing!

And there is really a \"La Mere\" (old mother) in the kitchen cooking for you too!

Service can be spotty at time...  but is that part of the package?"}
