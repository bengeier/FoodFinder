{"text":"I ate here last night about 8:30pm with my fiancé. We had been here once before and it seems they have renovated so the place looks way better. They now also serve you a free appetizer of shrimp chips with peanut satay sauce, which is delicious!

We ordered the 4 pieces of spring rolls as an app, and they were tasty. The dipping sauce seems to be honey with mirin; it's good.

I had the Tamarind Duck: yum! Nothing to complain about. Crispy pieces of sliced duck on top of crispy noodles topped with a few sliced veggies in a tangy and savoury tamarind sauce. They serve a tiny salad on one corner of the dish which I had no desire of eating, but only because I didn't come for salad and I'm not a salad person.

My fiancé had their Red Curry, and it was very tasty and had a good heat to it. We like eating spicy food and find most restaurants keep their \"spicy\" dishes pretty mild.

The atmosphere is nice, it's very relaxing and calm. The service is great, and the servers will take time to explain anything you may have questions about. They are also very friendly.

I will definitely be returning any time I have a craving for Thai!"}
{"text":"Probably the best authentic Thai I have tried in the city!!! The atmosphere inside was perfect for a date night or a fun get together with some girlfriends."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night.  We got 2 of the wok dishes, shrimp and grilled chicken.  The food was tasty once it was reheated in the microwave to warm.  We have ordered here before, but this time we got about 1/2 the serving size of everything - the plastic containers were only about 40% full !   For an order over $50 - although taste was good, definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here on a weekday for dinner. There weren't many other customers so we were seated quickly. The overall atmosphere is a little bit darker than I would like but that is just a personal preference.

Overall the food was delicious. They serve complementary shrimp chips with peanut sauce which sets the mood for the rest of the meal. The coconut soup is a great starter. I had pad see ew for my main corse and I was not disappointed.

The service was great and the food was served very quickly.

One of the better places to enjoy Thai cuisine in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had the basil beef fried rice, fried fish with mango sauce, lamb curry (comes with rice), fried wontons and they included 4 spring rolls for free.

Portion sizes were average to small, not large though.

We ordered pick up.  The fish was perfect, very delicious.  The lamb  curry seemed watery and the meat was not very flavourful.  The fried wontons and the spring rolls were ok.  Price was excellent and the service was friendly and fast.  I would definitely try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Tasted really good and could say it tasted authentic. But they also have fusion menu such as Crab Rangoon."}
{"text":"I'd say more of a 3.5, not a 4. Food had great taste and flavour but NOT for that price. I work as an analyst and couldnt make sense of how the Panang Curry could come to over $15.00?? It was white rice, coconut milk, chicken and peanuts."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. The food is always delicious. I especially love their curries and every time we eat here we get complimentary shrimp chips, which are awesome. Occassionally we get the spring rolls as a starter and they are also quite good. My favourite item is the golden curry with a side of sticky rice. Yum! They do have a small parking lot, so we tend to avoid coming here Fridays and Saturdays, but other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Easily the best thai food in Etobicoke and among the top in GTA. Their curry is good. Fried rice is great and noodles are awesome. Altho the menu is small and options maybe limited. If you love in the area and don't want to travel all the way to downtown this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I've been to Taste of Thailand on multiple occasions and they constantly deliver fresh food and good service.  All my meals have started with complimentary shrimp chips served with peanut sauce.  Their Pad Thai and curries are good but a few of their soups and salads are a must.  My favourite soup is their Tom Yum soup; the broth concoction is the perfect balance of hot and sour.  Their salads are unique, colorful creations; one of my favourites is the duck salad mixed with lychee, peppers and other vegetables.  All their dishes are reasonably priced.  The only downfall is location, adjacent to an adult shop and surrounded by chained restaurants definitely makes this restaurant a diamond in the rough.  Overall, a great place to have authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Taste of Thailand Cuisine has good food at pretty reasonable prices.  The grilled beef was delicious, the crispy tilapia with mango salad was refreshing and tasty, and my husband loved the pineapple rice. The staff were helpful and even grabbed a small plate and spoon for my toddler. The restaurant is cozy, but it would be difficult to have a large party here.  Definitely would recommend this place to anyone for an evening out."}
{"text":"OMG! New Favorite restaurant!

I am a big Fan of Thai cuisine, and this is by far the best Restaurant I have eaten at. I ordered the Pad Phed (spicy sauce with Rice) and coconut Shrimp. It was the best dish I have had. I am usually not a fan of curries, but the Pad Phed was delicious! I usually go for the basics like coconut rice, pad thai/pad seew, pineapple fried rice or cashew nut chicken, so on a limb I chose the Pad Phed and it is my new favorite dish!

Although it is a small quaint restaurant, that lacks the fine dining atmosphere, it fits my budget and comfort very well. You should definitely try it for the food! And that's what really matters, the FOOD!"}
{"text":"I am with the other reviewer, dont get the positive reviews they must have a helping hand.

Food was poor, soggy or dry, tasteless, very small portions, long time to make though for some reason.  I have been to a good thai place and this was more food court quality.

They also forgot one of our orders and were not very motivated or helpful."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, and delicious food.

Lunch specials are really tasty and reasonably priced.  Have not yet gone for dinner but if lunch is any indication, I imagine the same level of food service.

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere wasn't bad. Interior features a high steeple ceiling, Thai decor, Thai ornaments in a picture frame, an LCD TV playing a slide show of pictures of Thailand, tea candle lit on the tables, wreaths by the window seats. 

We were then seated and waitress gave us our menus. I noticed my menu had a large burn hole on it. I didn't question it. However maybe it was a sign of things to come?  

When trying a new place I like to order something simple. If the place can make the simple dishes then anything out of the ordinary or exotic I could probably take a chance on. However if the place cannot make even a simple dish better I find it's best to end your meal there and take your loss.

We ordered two dishes to share:

Curry: chicken peanut sauce
From the Wok: Cashew nut chicken 

They were terrible. 

The curry was spicy and there was no warning of that. My GF not too found of spice and intentionally ordered it because the menu did not denote a chili for spice.

Cashew nut chicken dish was so sweet, as if there was like relish in it. I can only imagine how badly the pad Thai must be. 

I ended up mixing the peanut sauce and from the shrimp chips and the peanut curry to the cashew nut chicken dish to voila create my own peanut curry cashew nut chicken dish to even the sweetness out. 

Oh the food came out faster than fast food restaurant. This stuff is just slapped together. 

The place was no good, atmosphere alright, but food terrible. I felt deceived by the Yelp community who reviewed this restaurant and gave it a high 4 star rating. It's also right beside an adult video store?!  So if you're taking a date and this place doesn't pan out maybe consider visiting that..  Ha-ha jk

2 stars"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for a romantic date or a girl's get together.  There's many authentic Thai dishes to try and share, not to mention the delicious drinks to go with them!

After you order, they give you a basket of shrimp chips and a dipping sauce for it which is a nice touch while you're waiting for your food to come. 

I would recommend ordering the spring rolls, they were cooked perfectly! 

Their pad thai has a good amount of sauce and was very flavourful. The decor is very nice inside, very modern and not what you would expect when you drive past it."}
{"text":"We've very recently fallen in love with Thai food so we've been trying about a lot of places lately.

The decor is simple but elegant and cozy. There's also an outside patio but it's right off the main road so it's pretty noisy there. Food came fairly quickly. We received the shrimp chips with peanut dip and it was devoured in seconds - so good! We ordered Hot and Sour Soup which was simple but very tasty. My fiance ordered the curry pad thai - BEST pad thai we've ever had! The curry was had a wonderful flavour. I had the chicken fried rice. The servings were very generous and beautifully plated. The prices were very reasonable.

I would highly recommend going to this restaurant! I know we'll be going there again many many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Such good Thai food!!!! We both got the Peanut Curry - Panang, and it has the perfect amount of crunch, creaminess, peanut, and Panang. We also got sticky rice and fresh rolls, which were also incredible. Will absolutely order from here again- probably our new go to Thai food place!"}
{"text":"A warm Thai restaurant in Etobicoke, food was good but nothing special. We got complimentary shrimp chips with peanut sauce. We order sea food fried rice and oyster sauce wok with beef, came with mushroom broccoli and white onion. 
Quantities compared to other Thai restaurants were smaller but prices are almost the same. 
Service was good, our waiter was attentive, fast and smiled frequently."}
{"text":"I came here for a late-ish (730) weeknight dinner. Servers were in shorter supply and there were a fair number of tables filled for a late weeknight so the service was a bit slow, but nice enough. I tried the shrimp rolls and calamari for appetizers. Both were pretty good. The sauce they came with was yum, honey-like. For my main I had the tamarind chicken wok dinner with rice. It was also quite good. Overall I wasn't disappointed with the food at all. But the price:portion ratio was pretty off. Small portions high prices, and I'm even comparing to the gauging prices of downtown Thai restaurants here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I must say they know what great customer service is all about. The food was delicious from start to finish. The servers were phenomenal, pleasant and courteous. I like the cozy and intimate atmosphere of the restaurant. I would defiantly recommend this restaurant in the Etobicoke area for some great Thai food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Food and service here is great. The curry pad thai here is to die for. We always order the shrimp chips, coconut soup, hot and sour soup, crispy wontons and the deep fried shrimp. The sticky rice with mango is a delicious way to end the meal."}
{"text":"This was my first trip, but I doubt it will be my last. The food was delicious and well-prepared. I got pad see ew, one of my Thai faves, and the portions were smaller than I sometimes see in noodle dishes elsewhere, but were definitely enough to be satisfying. I also loved the crunchy and naturally sweet fried banana dessert I ordered (with honey only... no chocolate!). Oh, and the complementary shrimp chips and peanut sauce before our meal were a very nice touch.

The service was fast, friendly, and totally accurate. The prices were reasonable. The location (while being next to a dodgy-looking adult video store,) is super close to Kipling Station, so it's convenient, too.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast, but the food disappointed after all the good reviews on here. 
We had the steamed seafood curry which was a little weird with the semi-firm eggy layer (seafood slightly overcooked) and the watery layer beneath. The veg in it was primarily onion and some kind of cabbage, which wasn't too thrilling. It was not at all spicy. I was quite disappointed with the dish.
The other dish was a noodle soup which I think was marked with 2 chilies on the menu, but was barely spicy in real life. 
Best parts of the meal were the Crab Rangoon appetizers and the coconut rice. 
We realized we'd forgotten the leftovers when we got a couple blocks away from the restaurant and decided they weren't worth driving back for. Don't plan to go there again."}
{"text":"The crab Ragoon is very good. The red curry chicken is fantastic. The coconut mango sticky rice is heavenly"}
{"text":"Hello All,
Actually have been here several times and unfortunately this review will see a slide from our previous experiences. 

The friendly service we have always received in the past was gone. The free shrimp chips and peanut sauce (always served in the past was not offered), though it was present on some surrounding tables (WTF). An easy modification of an order was advised that it would be $3 extra (though asking to substitute - not extra). There was no return to see if all were satisfied, nor asking about dessert. Perhaps it was just our server, or perhaps under new management? 

In any case we will likely give one more chance to see if this is an aberration or the new normal.  

Also agree with Judy that parking is problematic and can be a challenge"}
{"text":"My friend brought us to this restaurant for dinner this past week. Its located in a small plaza area, which doesn't have a lot of parking space. We have heard that the lot next to us, doesn't mind if cars park there. When we went it wasn't busy at all, they told us we can seat anywhere. We ended up choosing a spot in front of the store to the corner. The restaurant was really cold, we had to keep our coats on. There was so heat turned on or it wasn't working. Anyway, we order some drinks I got the Mojito which was watered down. I didn't bother getting another round. So for food I ordered the pad Thai with wontons. I thought it would have noodles, but it didn't. Anyway once the food arrived it looked good on the plate but as you tasted it, it wasn't that good. It had too much oil in it. I personally didn't like the food at all I don't think I will be returning ..."}
{"text":"Ordered on just-eat with my boyfriend the other day. We ordered the green curry beef, peanut curry chicken, coconut shrimp, a coconut rice, and sticky rice. All came to around $50, but what do you expect from thai food, its always expensive. We only got 5 pieces of coconut shrimp as the website said it came with 6, and the shrimps did not have any coconut taste to it, as usually they would have coconut shavings or something to it. The peanut curry chicken tasted great, there was an OK amount of chicken. The green curry beef was pretty watery and there was only so much beef in there. The ratio of curry to beef was about 1:15, where as if you order from a Chinese restaurant (lets take mayflower's Beef and Broccoli) for 8.55 or for 9.70 (A beef curry that actually comes with steamed rice) the beef ratio is much better. We were expecting better food paying $50."}
{"text":"Decent Thai place, felt like they mixed our spice levels request. Surprised no one has mentioned anything about their Khao Soi. It's no Pai, but a solid place here in the West. Red curry was flavourful. They said rice was $1.5 and bill came to $2 so small issue, but still, know your prices :P"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. I'm still rather new to the whole thai food thing so I played it safe and went with the standard favourite, Chicken Pad Thai. It was delicious, it was fair priced, and there was still enough for left overs. Perfect take-out choice for a cold, wet, rainy Sunday.

Shame I'm discovering it only now when I'm about to move..."}
{"text":"Mediocre and forgettable. Wasn't bad and wasn't good, just ok. Most Thai is much better than this and good Thai is light years past this place. Recommended if you absolutely can't find anything else to eat."}
{"text":"After reading the many reviews on this page, we decided to order from this place.  When a resto says the delivery time is going to be 45-60 minutes, I'm totally fine with that and expect it with more than three dishes being ordered.  When they show up 20 minutes later I seriously question the freshness of the food.  Green curry; watery and gross. Noodle dish; watery (no idea how) and even more gross. Beef fried rice; really tasty and so good (it was the saving grace of spending over $50 here). And a few other things that aren't worth mentioning. 

All in all, will never order from this place again. Which is sad because they are probably better dining in. But first impressions are unfortunately a deal breaker when it comes to dining out-or in. 

Wouldn't recommend, at all. Sorry Taste of Thailand, curry should be a meal not a hot drink."}
{"text":"I would describe this restaurant as Thai food with a flare.  Dinner started off with complimentary shrimp chips and spicy peanut dip, which I've never had at a Thai restaurant before.  It was a fun pre-dinner appetizer.

Mee Krab Rad Nar (with choice of tofu, veggies, chicken or beef) $14 - The noodles in this dish is very different from the traditional flat wide rice noodles.  The crispy egg noodles were chewy and tasted a little like shredded tofu.  I prefer the traditional noodles over this.  The Chinese broccoli was fresh and had a nice snap.  The sauce was very tasty.

Pad Thai with Crispy Wonton and chicken $14 - So instead of noodles, this dish is served with wonton, which is chewy in the sauce.  It's an interesting twist to the traditional pad Thai.  The sauce was very good.

Mango with sticky rice $10 - This dessert is above average, not too sweet and delicious.

The restaurant is nicely decorated and pleasant.  Service was good.  There's a small private lot in front of the restaurant and if there is no space in the evening, there's a parking lot right next door for a place that's closed at night.

{"text":"My favourite Thai restaurant in Etobicoke. Everything is great, hope they keep the quality as I will go to this place and take my friends here."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in a while so I got some delivery.  Tom Tom soup was excellent.   Pad Thai way to sweet.   Pineapple rice so so.   Portions were quite small and a touch on the pricey side for the quality of the food.  It's a shame I quite enjoyed the food many years ago."}
{"text":"Great find! We came here on a whim because I was craving for some good Thai cuisine after an errand. 

Its a fairly nice place tbh. I just don't recommend anyone with a big stroller to bring it in because theres no place to park it. The tables are somewhat close to each other and passage ways are narrow. Good thing it wasn't busy so we manage to take up a space in a corner. I just had to sit awkwardly but it was okay. 

Anyway, we had their lunch special and it was surprisingly filling. Its very cute how they shape their plain rice into a heart, haha. Anyway, I love their red curry (chicken) and my partner got the basil fried rice (also yummy) so I recommend trying those. We also got the coconut shrimp as an appetizer ..just a little too overdone in my opinion but still good.

Overall, I would come and visit again. Nothing truly amazing but its a great find for me since its hard to find a decent thai cuisine one around the area. Am curious to try more stuff in their menu or just come back for the same red curry.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was incredible!! Love the fried wonton appetizer!! :)
Service was more than friendly. I could probably eat here often!! The tamarind chicken and green curry was awesome! 
You won't regret eating here!"}
{"text":"Tough marker, I could easily give this place a 4. Friendly service though English comprehension a bit of an issue. 

Food is solid but not traditional Thai where one shares a plate. Suffers from poor local ingredients and cold climate, not the fault though. 

Lunch specials are a solid bet with the basil fried rice my pick of the meals, the pineapple fried rice is excellent too. Avoid the pad Thai, typically gluggy and too saucy."}
{"text":"First time trying this place...for lunch, great food with decent portion sizes for the lunch menu and reasonably priced....
Will definitely be returning...."}
{"text":"Go before 3 pm, lunch specials...
Great pad Thai and wonton soup.
Regular menu is EXPENSIVE.

Go early :)"}
{"text":"friendly staff. Delicious food. Good prices.

Just make sure you have paper towel to dry your hands in the bathroom please.

I will be back."}
{"text":"Just tried take-out from this Thai restaurant for the first time tonight. I chose this instead of my regular spots even though its further away, because it's open until 10PM where most other Thai places close by 9. I still wish it was open later though. 

I got Chicken Pad Thai and Thai Green Curry Shrimp. The Pad Thai was not overly sweet, had a generous portion of bean sprouts and peanuts without any real heat. 

The green curry was flavored well, with strong taste of coconut milk and a spicy kick (Well, spicy for me at least, who isn't someone that eats alot of really hot foods). Flavors were spot on, broccoli in the curry was a nice touch, but I'd lose the bell peppers. They add nothing to the dish and seems rather inauthentic. 

My one gripe is that a couple of the shrimps still had a bit of the vein attatched, so I had to finish cleaning them by hand..  which is one of my pet peeves. 

Long story short -- I would visit again. Each dish was about $10-$11."}
{"text":"Always a great place for food on the west end. Thanks for the delicious food and great service! Always my top choice for food near Kipling station, when meeting clients for dinner from downtown."}
{"text":"The place is small and is lacking in parking spots.  We have dined in a few times but often just stop by on the way home to pick up food.  They make a very tasty peanut sauce that goes well with chicken or fish.  Dishes are small but very good and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The quantity may not be that large (unlike many other restaurants), but the taste is really good. We had Chicken in white sauce, Vegetable mix and Seafood curry... all of them was nicely cooked, having good aroma.... appetizing!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food done properly and authentically.  We had fresh rolls, which were not only delicious but very prettily done, with  shrimp tail sticking out of each.  Tom yom and Tom kha were both excellent, as were the pad thai and red curry (which did include rice without having to order it on the side).  Meals include a comp snack of shrimp chips with terrific peanut sauce.  Friendly, accomodating service.  Ginger tea was a great accompaniment.

Prices are about average for Thai food."}
{"text":"The food here was great and the service was excellent for our group of 7.  The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is 
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"You'll be surprised that a good restaurant is beside an adult video store. The decor isn't bad, nice and cozy. Pad thai is on the greasy side, but not the ketchupy kind from dreaded spring rolls. Fried rice selections are delicious, good use of the fish sauce and cashews. Prices are ok, average for a thai food place but sadly portions are small. I am often yearning for more due to my high metabolism. There are entertaining lady boys who work there."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with friendly staff and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"The food was quite overpriced, the glass noodles were really watery, and the beef was soggy and tasteless. Additional the duck was subpar and the vegetables were far to soggy. One meal of duck with rice for $17.00 sorry not to be rude but this really wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and the place was clean. The ingredients were fresh. But this is far from authentic. I can understand why it gets high ratings bc ppl here have no idea what authentic Thai is supposed to taste like. I had the pad thai and it was so sweet. Almost tasted like ketchup. Authentic pad thai is actually supposed to be a little salty and not sweet at all. While I dont mind the Canadianized sweet version, this was way too sweet. Staff here is Thai, and I expected better."}
{"text":"It's essentially well presented food for a very good price. It's clean, and satisfying...but took a LONG time for us to get our food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars:

Taste of Thailand offers up a bunch of Thai dishes on the west end of Toronto. Located near Kipling, the restaurant is easily accessible by transit and has some parking at the front. 

I tried the Red Thai Curry - spicy but very rich sauce. Portions are generous and will leave you full. Food is presented well and prices are reasonable.  Atmosphere is not like a downtown restaurant but the staff are friendly and the restaurant wasn't too busy. 

I did try the Mango Sticky Rice and did not know what to expect. It's basically a slab of sticky rice served with mango slices on the side. This is all accompanied by some sort of sweet but bitter sauce. Overall, I wouldn't recommend as the dessert left me unimpressed."}
{"text":"Yay! I found a decent Thai restaurant near my place. Thai is my go to take-out Asian cuisine on nights for I'm too lazy to cook - Aside from Indian *drool*. The prices are decent here too. I have also dine in here and the experience is pleasant. The facilities are clean and the servers are helpful and attentive.

They usually give you an appetizer/snack (not charged on your bill)  which is a peanut sauce with these crispy chips that taste like shrimp.

I had the Pad Thai (Duh!) with seafood though. This came with squid, shrimp, muscles, crab etc. You can also let them know the level of spicy you'd like you dish, so you can go as spicy as you want ;)

The mango salad was enjoyable. I'd say it was average. Too many onions for my liking to be honest."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have had in ages! Excellent Customer Service. For those that have a working tongue and can differentiate between different flavors - this was tasty authentic Thai (not a Chinese restaurant posing to be a Thai place, as is case with most other so-called \"Thai\" restaurants)."}
{"text":"On our last day in Torrono as the locals call it the wifey was in the mood for some good Thai food and once again you Canadian YELPERS came through.
The ambience was warm so unlike the sub zero temperature outside and our servers were friendly and polite in fact they even gave us access to their wifi... which was worth an extra *!!!
The Lunch special came with a Soup or Salad and a Veg Spring Roll....which was deelish!
The food was delicious and deceptively filling, between the 5 of us we had the Pad Thai, Chicken Curry, Veg Curry, Shrimp Curry, Shrimp with Cashew nuts.  We all loved our meals and cleaned our plates up well.
WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK WHEN VISITING TORONTO AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Excellent spot...the food and service are both great!  It's not the fanciest of restaurants but you get exactly what you need...you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  Five Stars!"}
{"text":"I wanted everything on the menu. 
I had spring rolls and the green curry chicken with noodles. So yummy. I would strongly recommend this place. I wanted to lick the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, authentic & delicious food and great service. This place exceeded our expectations! The red and green curries that we had were some of the tastiest and most well presented we've had in Toronto. My glass of (very reasonably priced) house white wine came in a proper chilled glass. The atmosphere is very nice too, and if had been warmer, they have a spacious patio. This is my new go-to for Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is halal.

We went just as their lunch special was finishing at 3pm. It was a great time of day to go because it was not busy at all . This is an authentic thai restaurant.  None of this fusion- american-chinese stuff.

 My friend quite liked the thai coconut soup. I had the tamarind stir fry. It was crispy, sweet and sour. Yum. 

The setting is beautiful and cozy. The staff is nice. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"A dark and rainy Friday night.  Driving around Etobicoke/Mississauga looking for a restaurant and made a wrong turn.  This is how a lot of horror and/or porno movies begin.

After getting gas, we decided to give up on looking for the original place.  Looking across the street, we said 'How about Thai instead?'.

I've been to Tasted of Thailand before, but haven't been back for a few years because we generally forget that it's there.  Nestled between an abandoned motorcycle store now turned radio station and an adult novelty store, it's kinda hard to miss.

The restaurant is small and cozy.  The white linen table cloths denote that this is going to be a bit classier than the typical Spring Rolls experience.  Restaurant was pretty full, mostly with what look liked couples celebrating date night and also a few young couples with delightfully mute babies.

We order the appetizer platter ($12.95), mango salad ($6.95), tamarind beef ($9.95) and shrimp pad thai ($10.95).

Instead of a bread basket, we were brought a small basket of shrimp chips with peanut dipping sauce.  It was good and would have liked a bigger basket.

Food came quickly.  Everything tasted fresh and hot.  Pad thai had a nice 'wok hay' and tamarind beef was crispy and not too oily.

Finished off the meal with the fried banana and coconut ice cream dessert ($7.95).  Left feeling satisfyingly full and glad we didn't find that other restaurant we were looking for."}
{"text":"i have been to this place twice! the first time was not all that. the things i would stay away from were thai wings, calamari and their plain pad thai. it was overly sweet i literally had to put hot sauce on it. my sis got their mango salmon which was good except they fried the salmon which i didnt like. maybe asked for it to be grilled. 

the good dishes were panag curry and mango salad. 

the second time i went i did take out and got curry pad thai with beef. It was AMAZING very similiar to islamic noodles at salad king in toronto. good amount of beef with a delicious sauce. i am going back today to get it again for lunch! its also a large portion i was able to have left overs for dinner"}
{"text":"$10 lunch was wicked
Red curry chicken was awesome 
Came with the coconut soup and spring roll
I was surprised it was so good. And CHEAP 
Amen
Wish it was down town

Just went on the weekend (randomly in the hood) and ordered the chicken red curry, spring rolls, and a noodle dish and again n Not disappointed!
Loved everything!
Especially the free shrimp chips and peanut sauce!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood and was in the mood for some Thai food. I've ordered from this place in the past, but this was the first time I had dined in. 

This location is on Dundas near Kipling station oddly placed between a row of dealerships and an Adult video store. When I walked in, I was immediately seated. The decor is nice and simple, but I found the flat screen TV on the wall playing the game distracting and out of place. Also the burn holes in the menus are a little disconcerting

I ordered the Green Curry dish and the rice was heart shaped. Despite the cute details, I found the whole thing a bit bland. I honestly think my love for Green Mango and Salad King may be at work here because as I mentioned I used to order from here all the time and used to love it. I guess my taste buds are now posh!"}
{"text":"Great Thai cuisine in the Etobicoke area. Friendly staff and cozy place. However, I think the heater broke, but they did have heating lamps. Didn't help too much so we kept our jackets on. It was still worth it there because their curry pad Thai was delicious. We even order Thai ice tea despite the lack of heat in the restaurant. My favourite Thai ice tea so I had to get some!!"}
{"text":"Food could have used a bit more spicing up; but overall the experience and service was great.  The server was very pleasant and even my toddler enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Food is decent and service is very friendly. Probably give it more closer to 3.5*
There are definitely a couple better Thai restos I've tried in the GTA. But good fix if have a craving. Pad Thai is decent. Not ketchupy or sweet like many pseudo Thai places around. 
Lunch special is great price for around $10 gets u an entree, spring roll and choice of soup or salad from Monday - Friday."}
{"text":"Had the Pad See Ew for lunch.  Nice presentation and good.  Would go back.  Free Asian chips N dip was tasty."}
{"text":"To be exact, for this time, 2.5 stars. And I've been here many times since 5 years ago. 

A disappointing dinner. It's great that there's shrimp chips while you wait for your food. 

The menu prices are higher now. Most dishes including the CURRY does not come with rice!!! The only Thai place that I know as of 2018, that you have to pay extra for a bowl of rice. 

The tofu green curry was nice to taste and hot. My thick noodles with veggies was not hot at all (spice wise). It was too salty and had a lingering taste of sweetness too. A bit strange. The portion is smaller than other Thai places that I've been to. 

Definitely disappointed this time around. Will go back for the lunch specials. Otherwise I won't bother going here. Also, parking could be an obstacle."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised this place has high reviews. They don't care about food quality or customer service in anyway. 

I went yesterday evening and ordered a noodle dish... it came to me as a soup? When I told the server that I didn't want soup and that it did not say it was a soup on the menu and that I wanted to order the pad thai instead, she REFUSED to take back the dish... then she moved on to say because I chose a medium spice level there was no way to change up the dish to be re-served to another customer... mind you this was about half an hour before they close, clearly no one else was going to order it and that's kinda gross to know they would of given my dish to another customer when I already tasted it. She still refused to take it off my bill and told me I needed to take it to go(?) So she packed it up in a much smaller container (smaller than the dish actually was) and told me I had to take it... I didn't want to argue because I was with a coworker... so I ordered the pad thai instead and it was honestly nothing spectacular, very watery and sweet. There's much better thai places in the area, especially downtown. 

15 minutes before close she gave us the bill when we were not even done eating yet and told us they were closing and we had to leave soon... I am so shocked at how awful this place was, I've never experienced this type of careless service. Definitely never coming back and I advise the same for everyone else. 

I never want to leave a bad review but I 100% cannot believe how awful this experience was and she did not care at all that what she was doing was wrong. I'm surprised they're still getting good reviews."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and service... 

My wife and I are very picky on how we like our food...  All of our requests were met without hesitation or issue.  We will be back."}
