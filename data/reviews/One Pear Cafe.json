{"text":"Horrible pineapple bun with butter for a place that prides itself on it. Bun was stale, sides crusty and dry and isn't warm enough to submerge with butter.   My friend ordered their curry fish ball. DO nOT GET IT! it's apparently llke grocery store-bought frozen fishball with a bland store-bought curry sauce. It's the worst our friends have eaten!   Also tried their milk tea. It's alright but not worth $6. The tea taste was not strong enough and lacked the bitterness that's iconic to hk style milk tea.   Would not come back again."}
{"text":"Came to try this place out as this cafe was pretty hyped up on social media- but i must say it was kind of a disappointment.  This is a very small cafe on Dundas, there were total of 4 seats only. The interior/ decor was pretty nice though- it looked like those retro hk cafes.  We ordered: - Onepear iced lemon passion fruit $5.5 - Onepear hong kong style condensed milk tea $5.9 - pineapple bun with butter $3.9 - egg waffles $3.9  They didn't have the egg waffles available so we had to scrap that. The bill was pretty expensive- for only 3 items it was a total of $17 including tax for a small bun with 2 drinks.  The pineapple bun with butter was not bad, but nothing spectacular. You can get the exact same bun uptown for alot cheaper.  The milk tea was overpriced too, it was just like a regular milk tea that you could get at an hk style cafe for half the price (i find it kinda crazy that it's even more expensive than a bubble tea )  I would not come back again as i feel like i can get the exact same meal with like quality for half the price elsewhere."}
{"text":"This newly opened spot on Dundas is always empty whenever I walk by, but after taking a look at their menu online, I really wanted to try some of their drinks since they looked interesting.  Starting with the OnePear Hong Kong-style Milk Tea, it was a major letdown. It was bland and you can't really taste the base tea at all since the milk overpowers it completely. It was overly creamy and didn't have that subtle bitterness that authentic HK milk teas have. Although I got mine \"hot,\" it came out lukewarm.  I also wanted to get some bubble waffles but they didn't have any available, which I found really odd. I got there at 1:30 PM so whether they couldn't or wouldn't make any is unclear. Suffice it to say, I'm now iffy on whether to go back at all."}

{"text":"OnePear cafe just opened up two days ago. Currently, it's their soft opening and they are still sorting things out. However, having said that the milk tea was very smooth and tasty. I actually think it's one of the best in town. It wasn't too sweet and has a creamy taste to it, just right.   The curry fish balls and lobster balls were nice because the curry tasted nice, wasn't too spicy. My mom and I really enjoyed the milk tea and curry fish balls  Came back for another cup of milk tea and  lobster balls and curry fish balls on Good Friday. The milk tea was smooth and creamy. I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Milk tea- it was good. The texture was smooth, and it had the right amount of sweetness to it. But the flavour wasn't as strong as the HK milk tea offered by other cafes and bakeries.   Pineapple bun- I liked it; but is it worth $4? That's debatable when you can go to Chinatown, buy multiple buns for the same price and put your own butter in it. However, it is slightly cheaper than Phoenix Cafe's pineapple bun, so it's not the steepest bun in Toronto. The bun wasn't particularly extraordinary, but it definitely wasn't as bad (for me, anyways) as people made it out to be in their reviews. The bun was soft, and the texture of the top part was great.  I would come back here again, but I wouldn't make regular visits since the price is steep for what it is."}
{"text":"Went to One Pear to try it out and left disappointed. I ordered a cold Hong Kong style lemon tea, it cost around  $7 after taxes. At this price I can probably get two of these uptown, but given the location I wouldn't mind if it was good. It tasted like diluted Nestea powder - not tea, not lemon, not good. I tried to squeeze some lemon taste myself but don't bother, the straw is too weak to poke anything."}
{"text":"Just wrote my first Yelp review because this cafe was so ridiculous. We were looking forward to it from the posts on Instagram, but was really disappointed to find that this was just another overhyped instagram food blogger post.   Food and drinks were way overpriced. True that this cafe is located in a busy downtown location, but at least justify this price point by serving decent food. The milk tea was at best passable, but the tea flavour was very faint and contained more milk than tea. We also ordered the assorted curry balls and that was no more than tasteless boiled balls with curry sauce poured over it separately. The curry was not HK-style curry at all and had little flavour or spice. And they priced it at almost $7! My friends ordered the pineapple bun and it wasn't even warm. The bun was so dry, I think the overnight ones from T&T are better.  Please put more effort into the food to at least justify the price."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Facebook and the picture was appetizing enough that my friends and I went for a food trip today and started here. Tried the pineapple butter bun and it was pretty good. Too bad the Hong Kong style waffle was unavailable today.  Hong Kong style milk tea and Hong Kong style coffee milk tea were good.  Cute decor. Server was so friendly even offered to take photos of us.  Only downside here is the lack of seats.  Only 4 seats available."}
{"text":"I was walking home when I noticed that One Pear has opened up, so I ventured in to give it a try. The first thing I noticed was the price tag for the drinks. $6 for a lemon tea/ HK milk tea?! And $5 for a 7-up lemon tea/ Ovaltine? What...they're usually $2-3 bucks at any HK style cafes. But anyhow, since I already walked in, I decided to order an egg waffle at $4, which was $1 more than the usual. And man, it was really subpar. The entire waffle was soft & floppy, and the inside wasn't even cooked through. It's not pleasant at all to keep chewing on a glob of dough. The taste was mediocre as well; just egg-y. I threw out half of it.   Since they just opened up, I'll give them 2 stars in hope that things will improve. And I hope they do given the number of competition in the area. Price was not considered in the rating. Service was okay."}
{"text":"This is probably the best curry fish balls i have even had. The curry sauce is creamy and savory.  i strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was garbage and overpriced. Curry beef balls had no curry taste. Pineapple bun was dry AF and not even warm, freshly made in house? More like freshly made lies. The food was so bad I actually decided to register an account on yelp to leave a review."}
{"text":"The menu is restricted to few options. While the store is pretty small. The better choice is grab and go. Im really into the posters on the wall. Great place to take photos.   I just ordered the pineapple bun this time. In order to acquire  better taste, you had to eat it right away when the bun was freshly heated. Same for the HK style waffle. I like the pineapple butter bun because it tastes soft and authentic! I only ate pineapple bun without butter in Guangzhou before. For me, the butter really makes a big difference. According to the introduction on social media, they said it is unsalted butter. However, I don't think so ... the salty and sweet taste was incredibly delicious though. More importantly, I would suggest to have the butter slice thinner. I think that's too buttery for me.   Least but not least, I have to admit one thing : it is the childhood memory trumps the tastes of bun."}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews, I've decided to give this place a try. Ordered the HK milk tea ($5.90) with tax is like $6.67 (almost $7!!) I shared the drink since it's a big cup size to drink alone. The milk tea is very creamy and taste similar to the milk tea at \"Phoenix Cafe\" which they're known for their \"no ice Hk milk tea\". I wish this place have a smaller size as well instead of only 1 size since it was a little heavy for 1 person to drink. To me, it was pretty pricey for a Hk milk tea. For this price, I rather get a bubble tea or smoothie. I didn't get a chance to try their pineapple buns and balls yet as they were expensive as well. But I guess it can't be compared considering the location, it's good that they are opening more Asian food places in the downtown core, don't need to travel so far uptown!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop with appropriate decor as it is a Hong Kong caf√©. Pineapple butter buns are definitely a must-try! The bun itself is warm and sweet, while the piece of butter is cold, salty and creamy. There is a perfect balance between the two and each bite is heavenly. I thought the portions of butter were enough, but I'm sure you can ask for another slab (for those butter lovers out there ) Staff was also friendly."}
{"text":"Small little shop with a limited selection.  Probably it's due to being situated in a popular downtown locale but the prices are fairly expensive.    Pineapple bun with butter - the bun is typical if any HK menu staple but the thickness of the butter slice combined with the low temp of the bun was not so pleasant.  The bun was room temp so the butter did not melt at all.   Egg waffles - some stores choose to make it chewy and thick while others make their batter light and chewy.  One pear leaned towards the light and chewy and just enough sweetness which makes this a winner. Curry fish balls - another staple of Hk street food.  Nice curry sauce and very bouncy fish balls.  I would recommend they simmer these together for longer period of time as right now it just seems like they took cooked fish balls and poured curry sauce before serving. For $6.90, it's a bit steep. Drinks - it lean towards the sweet side.  If they have half sweet, these will be winners as well.  Would I go back? Sure.  Hopefully selections grows a bit in the upcoming months"}
{"text":"I pass by this place every lunch, and every time I've popped in to order the waffles, I am told by a very unenthusiastic cashier that no, they are not serving the waffles. This has happened at least 5 times. This is the main thing on the menu, I don't understand why it is never served! I caved and got the pineapple bun with the butter slice inside,  and the slice was so thick and haphazardly placed that it made a big, gross mess. Bun was cold. I also asked for the HK style milk tea, which was served lukewarm (even though I asked for hot). Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the pineapple bun with butter at this place, one of the best you can find in downtown Toronto. The HongKong style milktea has a stronger tea flavour than most of the other bubble tea stores, personally I love the taste, but be warned if you prefer Taiwanese style bubble tea (which usually has a mild tea base).   The overall quality is great!!"}
{"text":"Definitely less than impressed with one pear. This is the last time I trust instagram hype.   The place is super small and only sits four people at a time so we had to get our foods to go. We ordered the hk milk tea, hk style tea coffee, curry beef balls, and two pineapple buns. We walked around the area for 10 minutes before finding a clean bench to sit and eat on so imagine if this was the dead of winter or a super hot summer day...the butter and the bun was packed separately but put together in the same bag so the bun was cold by the time we settled down yet the butter was super soft and hard to get out of the plastic wrap. Of course she didn't give us any napkins and we didn't check the bag before we left...needless to say we got butter all over our hands and pants with nothing to wipe or wash them with because we're sitting like a couple of hobos in a park. It was pricy for what it was and even then I would much rather pay extra and eat pineapple buns that are fresh out the oven at an actual hk teacafe. The drinks were nothing special and you can get better and cheaper curry beef balls at pacific mall"}
{"text":"Milk tea is good. But food is definitely overpriced for the quality. Ordered the assorted curry balls ($6.99) and pineapple bun ($3.90). Curry balls tasted like the ones you could buy from the supermarket and there was a questionable \"curry\" sauce drizzled on top of it. Not worth it.   Pineapple bun was so dry, Mother Nature cried me a river... but seriously don't order it."}
{"text":"Very expensive and cannot compare to the ones in Markham. Overprice drink and the pineapple bun was hard and tasted stale. Good alternative option in DT but Not for the price and quality."}
{"text":"I like to order Hong Kong style milk tea every chance I get. Usually I pay around $3.5 for a cold hk milk tea, but today I made a horrible purchase at one pear cafe paying $5.9 for a milk tea that is not even cold, did not come with ice and the flavour was watered down. I was disappointed. The pineapple bun was just okay, it was not warmed up so I was eating a cold bun with a slice of butter. The staff was nice tho"}
{"text":"Firstly, I would like to say my cold HK milk tea was good. It's silky, bold, and balanced, with shades and notes that reassured me that I was NOT drinking the Coor's Light of milk teas that's known as Tim Horton's steeped tea, NOR was I drinking any of the endless diluted reiterations of the base for many bubble teas. This was a strong doppelganger of the iconic drink I grew so fond of in my childhood. Bravo. Reading your comments to other reviewers, I'm pleased to know that you are attempting to bring authenticity to this drink by using Black and White (instead of the garden variety Carnation) as well as Ceylon tea. At the same time, I hope you have a dedicated teamaster (who is behind the scenes expertly handling the silk stocking filter or what not)  who is constantly tweaking the blend of the different grades of leaves to leverage the strongest character of tea possible---because at this price point, it's a little too expensive (which I feel goes against the spirit of HK milk tea). Nevertheless, please continue refining as to progress towards greater levels of authenticity.  Secondly, I would like to know what is so remarkable about your pineapple bun. I invite the ???/??? connoisseurs of Yelp to explain to me otherwise (read: to tell me I'm wrong), but there was nothing extraordinary about the pineapple bun I ate here. Is there a premium or imported ingredient or labour intensive technique I'm missing here? Last time I checked, they are $1.50 for 2 on the lower tier of HK bakeries and just under $3 at higher end bakeries (and they typically include HK milk tea to boot!). We're talking about fresh-out-of-the-oven, butter-gently-melting-within delights. And I don't mean to eavesdrop, but there's no way in your Hong-Kong-cubicle-sized shop that I would be out of earshot: two of your staff were speaking about how the buns are made fresh every day but aren't made in-house! So why am I paying $4 for a reheated pineapple bun?!  I haven't tried your other food, but I hope they are miles better than their counterparts found at P-mall for a fraction of the price. Overall, I feel you folks could be more forthcoming with respect to the price disparity. Milk tea and pineapple buns are like the everyman's classic staple combo, supposed to be ???! But from where I stand, it's like you're in HK trying to sell an American a sausage McMuffin and medium coffee for an equivalent of 15 CAD---you know that won't fly. I respectfully ask for insight.  P.S. Regarding the subject of a menu in Traditional vs Simplified Chinese (as another reviewer has pointed out below), I agree ONLY to a degree from PURELY marketing/image standpoint. Taiwanese shops use traditional, other HK shops use traditional. Similar to how a French restaurant would not market their b¬úuf √† la Bourguignonne as Burgundy Beef, a real deal HK tea shop's menu would read ????, and not ????---last time I checked, you're trying to be the real deal, no? You've already got the nostalgic retro movie posters and signage, as well as Cantopop playing in the background---just a detail to complete the image/vibe. Just my two cents. It does not offend/bother me; I have no real personal stake in the matter.  P.P.S. If you introduce a breakfast combo with a sandwich involving the pineapple bun stuffed with ???+??+slice of American cheese, with a milk tea half the current volume for $10, I would totally bite!"}
{"text":"Good start but there's room for improvement! The drinks menu looks amazing though, grapefruit, kiwi, mango, green orange. I happened to order that HK waffle and it was a bit plain and I would recommend adding more sugar. The venue is cozy but very modern and the location is near Rolltation at Dundas and University. I would try this place again! 11 am to 11 pm - wow! That means I can get my waffle fix well after the shop in Dragon City Center closes. Overall an interesting addition to the new Dundas-University-Bay Asian dessert corridor."}
{"text":"The pineapple bun with the thick slab of butter was good, but nothing to write home about and not worth $4 or however much it is. Chinatown bakeries sell the pineapple buns for less than a $1."}
{"text":"I visited the cafe today because I heard so many good things about it, and it definitely holds up to my standards!  I purchased the Hong-Kong milk tea ($5.9), I loved that there wasn't any ice in it so the flavour won't be diluted by the ice once it melts. The price was pretty fair to me since that's what most milk teas cost these days.  I also purchased the pineapple butter buns ($3.9), it was my first time trying one of these and I ate two immediately. I loved how crispy the bun was, and mixed with the creaminess of the butter is definitely worth trying. The price was also ok with me since the taste was there to justify it. I'd rather pay a little bit more for something better tasting! Some other factors that attracted me were its decor and the attitude of the cashier. The decor felt very traditional to me with all these signs on the wall, which is refreshing to see since a lot of stores go for the same type of look these days. The cashier was super friendly and helped to make my experience more lovely. I would return to the cafe whenever I'm around the area!!"}
{"text":"This is a new cafe but probably my favourite place for milk tea.  The pineapple butter bun and Hk style milk tea are awesome.  Looking forward to more options on menu."}
{"text":"As I grew up in Canton, the pineapple bun reminded me of my childhood and I definitely liked it. The top part is pretty great I liked it a lot. Its actually my first time having butter in it... kinda too heavy for me next time can I ask for pineapple bun without butter? Lol  And for the milktea I can tell the difference from the Taiwanese style milk tea. It taste silky and traditional Hongkong style indeed uses ????, which makes it authentic. If I have to provide suggestion I will say, maybe consider putting a little less ?? as it started to get a little heavy when I finished a half of it. Also I would like to have the taste of tea stronger as it is one of the reasons why I love Hongkong style milk tea.  Overall, great service, liked the bun and milktea. More improvements could be made. I would like to try curry fish ball next time.    Ps: for the review that used \"butchered Chinese\", I am definitely offended. Even if you are proud of your culture you don't get to degrade other culture. And, if you and your language could represent your culture, I guess everyone can see how your culture really is."}
{"text":"I'm a Hong Kong native therefore \"Tea Restaurant\" is not just a choice of cuisine or a novelty option for food but it is life itself. It is the kind of food that I enjoy by myself and with friends also the kind of food that I can have for all three meals of the day. I am thankful that The Toronto suburb has an abundance supply of it. However, ever since I started working downtown I have been having such cravings for it on a daily basis that's why I was looking forward to One Pear ever since I noticed their sign during renovation.   On Monday I finally gave it a shot, I had a cold milk tea (???) Hong Kong style waffle (???) and Pineapple Bun with butter (???). The milk tea is a bit pricy but compared to other bubble tea shops their price isn't really that bad, and to be completely honest that's some fine milk tea as I assume they use real tea instead of tea powder. What impresses me is that they do not put ice in the tea to chill the drink but rather chill it from the outside so your milk teas wouldn't be diluted as the ice melt. In short, though it's on the pricey side, I wouldn't mind to buy one when craving hits.   For the waffle, I think there is room for improvement. The batter they use is nice and tasty but the texture is not quite what I expected. It was a bit too soft, It would be better if the outside of the waffle is crunchy while the inside is soft.   The pineapple bun with butter is good, it brings back memories from when I was a kid, though I think the portion could be bigger, but in general it's delicious and I highly recommend.   All in all I like this place and they do have some good foods to offer. I have yet to try their other snacks such as curry fish ball and beef ball, as well as their cold lemon tea. I will definitely be back. I give it a three stars so there'd be room for improvement. I wish to see more varieties to their menu (satay beef instant noodle ??? would be nice) soon."}
{"text":"1. I got shooed out because there was an event one day. So that wasn't great. There was no signage outside at all to indicate that there was a private event, so this was an unpleasant first impression.  2. The prices are insane. I get that they're downtown where rent is expensive, but $6.90 for a single serving (and not even a large plateful) of ?? (fish balls) is ABSURD!!! Equally preposterous is $5.90 for standard ??? (cha chaan teng/HK greasy spoon restaurant) drinks like lemon tea, milk tea, and yin yang (milk tea + coffee). I would NEVER, EVER pay the price of bubble tea for a Hong Kong style milk tea or lemon tea, with no toppings in it. Ever!!! I'm honestly floored that anyone would. The only thing that isn't so offensively priced is their regular ??? (egg waffles) - $3.50 each. Up in Markham (AKA Where the Asian People Are), the going rate has always been $3 for one waffle and $5 for two. So I can kind of accept $3.50. $4.50 for a flavoured one is kind of silly, but I'm not as offended about this as I am about the drinks.  3. I hate to be a jerk about things like this, but I am also not afraid to be a jerk about things like this - this is supposed to be a HONG KONG restaurant. If so, why is there simplified Chinese on the menu? I find this offensive. Sorry to get political, but we Hongkies do not use butchered Chinese. We use traditional Chinese, the beautiful script designed the way it was originally intended, thank you very much. This also leads me to believe that the food here must not be authentically Hong Kong style.  That's all."}
