{"text":"Omg. Omg. Omg. Omg. I really can't say anything else. This food is amazing. This is my first time here. The customer service is really good. The recommended so stuff for me. They are supper friendly. I had the dirty dumplings..... wow. I literally called my husband and told him I'm bringing him here tomorrow."}
{"text":"I gave this place a shot when it first opened hoping it would be good and I can't stop. I eat there a couple times a week easy. I've tried things that I've never tried and not once been disappointed. They have a set menu and specials that change so even though I've been there a couple of dozen times there's always something new to try, If you're a foodie it's a freakin treasure chest. They can put a spin on a traditional dish and make it art as well as signature dishes. Gary and his staff are super friendly and you can tell they have an unmistakable love and passion for food. I can't say enough about this place.. It's my favorite restaurant in the valley right now and I've had some good ones over the years. I'm fan for life at this point. Pho King Phenomenal Forever!!"}
{"text":"The food's pretty good and well-priced so I'd definitely come back. I'm not sure why the Tokyo Ramen is called that since it didn't seem very Japanese. It was good but it reminded me of instant noodles I can get from 99 Ranch for $.80. 

My hubby really liked his sandwich. The owner kindly brought out some jus for dipping but it wasn't until hubby was almost done with the sandwich, lol. 

There are some kinks to iron out service-wise but all-in-all, this is a welcome addition to downtown Henderson."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff. I ordered the special- beef ramen... it was ok. There was NO actual meat in it! It was just beef broth base. Noodles were pancit noodles not ramen. I added brisket for an extra $2. It was really spicy and too oily for my taste (wish I was told that before ordering). I forced myself to eat it because well I was hungry!! Also not enough veggies and noodles! Especially the noodles! I thought... Where's the noodles?!!?  I waited over 20 minutes for my order, but the server was nice enough to give me a complimentary Thai tea for the wait and to cool my mouth from the spiciness. I left there a little hungry! Glad I added the extra brisket! Not worth the price. Too bad I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"This was the best Bahn Mi sandwich I've ever had and I have had many! My uncle got the ramen and the broth was to die for!  The owner, Gary, is passionate about his food dishes and really knows how to bring out the flavors of Asian food! Wow. Next time I visit this will be the place to come for me!"}
{"text":"We were amazed how good their pho was.  It's different as the regular pho but we enjoyed the thick broth with garlic flavor. I want to try the different food on the menu next time. They sound very good.  It's a must go place!"}
{"text":"If you like pho, then it's your lucky day. I've tried 3 items on the menu so far and all 3 have been superb."}
{"text":"We were in search of some snackie poos and we came across this on yelp on our way to Las Vegas Lake. Food and service was great. Everything made fresh to order and tasted \"phenomenal!\"

4 people
- 3 Thai iced tea
- 1 ginger lemonade
- Dirty Chips
- Savory Pancake pulled pork taco (special* not listed in menu) 1 order comes with 2
- Drunken Noodles
- Thai BBQ Grilled Cheese

Nothing disappointed and price was fair. Everything was $48

Hard to find, we passed it a couple of times. Finally spotted the white and green banner - glad we made it!!

Owner/chef even came out to greet/serve us. He was very kind and made great food.

This will be a must stop place when we come back."}
{"text":"I usually dont write posts but came here today for first time and im very very disappointed the soups i got are both horrible no flavor and worst part is my soup had no broth at all whatsoever 20$ for 2 soups and its terrible i will not be coming back ever the staff was friendly but thats it"}
{"text":"2nd time that i dine in at this place and it is always a pleasure eating here, it is so seldom that an owner of the facility mingle with the guests, and this place?!? It was Awesome! The owner was there with us chitchatting until we got our food, and the food?!? It was Phonemenal!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Pho place open up so close to home, since normally I go over to the West side when the cravings kick in. Well after entering the establishment and seeing their menu which was a single sheet of white paper with about 10 items on it and only 1 of those was Pho...I knew I should've just left but I made the mistake of paying for some Pho that tasted more like Thai lemongrass soup that came out of an instant package. I oversee restaurants in my day to day and it seemed they were trying super hard to land some kind of travel channel/food network type attention. The names, innuendos unfortunately they didn't have the food to back it up. The staff was super nice but more concerned with their kids running around the place. There was probably 5 kids shouting and screaming, one was wearing a Pho King shirt another was just following mom around. As someone who does this for a living I would say stop trying to be so hip and wasting money on your paper costs and focus on increasing the quality and presentation of your food. This is Vegas, theirs tons of options at every corner! A few cheesy catchphrases and a smile is not enough. If your name says Pho King in the title then you should at least be prepared for people to call you on the menu options. Seems as if the owners were more concerned with being hip and cool and using every trick they could pull to draw media attention to themselves. Guess I will still take my trek to the West side until some decent Pho place opens in Henderson."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The ambience and customer service is on point and the food is terrific, it's great for a sit down or take out meal. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Our first visit and I must say this place certainly lived up to its name! Food was fresh and delicious! We had the Pho, chicken satay tacos, chicken fat rice and garlic chicken wings. Everything was pho king phenomenal!! Last but not least, we had roti for dessert and it was da bomb!!

Found a new hot spot so close to home!!"}
{"text":"The concept and the idea for this restaurant has potential. It is really comforting for people from Hawaii to know that they offer specials like spam musubi and loco Moco. Service is unique. Very interesting story about this establishment.  The food is delish if you like a bit of spice. The Japanese Ramen is good and spicy. Give it a try. The foods good."}
{"text":"Pho King is Phoking Amazing! I love traditional Pho but, this Thai Fusion brings a new experience that has me thinking this is the way it should be!!! The flavor is absolutely the best I've ever had anywhere. I love the broth, unfiltered with bits of bone marrow still in it, yummy. Sadly, they are located in a very old, outdated little strip of buildings. I've driven by many times and don't give these buildings a second look. Maybe that's a good thing come to think of it. Nice buildings and locations cost more so the price would have to go up as well. hmmm. I can only say, DONT let the look of the building keep you from an experience that will blow you away if you like fusion. Even the inside could use some help but, for me its about the food. The chef talked with me and I found that very nice, my server was extremely nice as well. I think I've found my new go to for amazing food. The entire menu is mouth watering and I cant wait to try everything. Maybe someday he'll have a buffet so I can try everything on one visit, hehe."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here and really enjoyed it.  Quirky little out of the way place but worth coming to with an open mind.  The panang burrito was about the best tasting panang curry I have ever had and I have been to thai restaurants all over the usa and some around the world. Very.nice people here deserving our supporr!!!"}
{"text":"Love supporting small local businesses! Had the Big Wang with broth for dipping. It was a really hardy, tasty and spicy sandwich. Definitely recommend the broth to dip in. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"It is Pho King Phenomenal !!! .. Everything we ordered was great !. We got one of everything on the menu and all of them was amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and staff are warm and friendly. I enjoyed the Pho and liked how you get the sides of sauces to make it as hot as you want it to be. The taste was delicious."}
{"text":"So this is the first time that I've been here and I can't sing enough of their praises. This place certainly lives up to its name. We had the Dirty Chips (sauced fried wonton), Drunk A.F. Noodles with chicken, and the Pho King Pho Bo. The food was incredibly delicious! The wait staff are friendly and personable. The atmosphere is relaxed and has a very social feel. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"We had the pho and fried rice - and they were excellent! The vibe here is great, and when we move to the area, it'll definitely be a staple for us."}
{"text":"New spot to check out in Henderson. Fusion of Thai and Japanese flavors. Enjoy the specials and get addicted to the Ramen. Great lunch spot for those in the area."}
{"text":"Food just wasn't good. 
I've had drunken noodles all over this city and the noodles here were soggy and seemed like they were missing all taste. They were completely bland and flavorless. Unfortunately, they were the worst DN I've had. 
I also looked for soy sauce to try to add SOME kind of flavor, as far as we could tell there isn't any here. 

The chicken wings were quite good though and the staff was supper nice and accommodating. 

The girl helping us always made sure we had everything we needed and even brought us free ice cream samples, which were also delicious. Her shy but genuine smile and attitude was the most redeeming part of our experience."}
{"text":"The customer service was really good, there was an online mess up with my order, but I felt like the owner was really nice about it and try to fix it asap. Free lemonade and a refill before I left. By the way it was really tasty! I had the drunken noodles and I didn't love it as much as I expected but it was okay!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place so when my husband ran errands I asked him to pick some stuff up on the way home.  He was impressed with the staff and the restaurant and we are both loving the food.

We got a little bit of everything and are glad we did because everything is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting fusion comfort food with flavors you won't find anywhere else.  Relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff.  They hand make the ice cream and the buttered popcorn with pork dust (yes, that's a flavor) was amazing.   Also had the Thai tots with two home made sauces and the drunken noodles where delicious.  These are evidently favorites.  Support your local businesses and give this place a try."}
{"text":"I think since there's a lack of Vietnamese food in the area, this place is pretty okay. Location was a little hard to find, the place is tucked away in a small plaza across the little church. Inside had limited tables, but was otherwise very clean and spacious! You order and pay at the counter before taking a seat.
I would say staff here was very enthusiastic, friendly, accomadating and that they really try their best.

I came for pho, and I would say the broth was decent, noodles were not as soft as I would prefer, but the beef balls were big and tender! I was a little surprised that shredded meat was in my soup instead of thin meat slices, but I can appreciate the different texture and flavor. All the sprouts and mint leaves are already in the bowl, so if you prefer to throw that in yourself separately, let them know.

Energy is great here, and I think that if I were in the area again I would come back to try thier other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great concept for a restaurant with amazing fusion food. The owner is also a super enthusiastic guy, very passionate about his food."}
{"text":"'I like a \"Big Wang,\" I cannot lie...With tasty \"Wang Sauce\" I don't deny.'... Aye, get your mind outta the gutter! It's the name of the sandwich bangin' here at Pho King Phonomenal Noodle Lab & Grill!

It's not your traditional pho place that's for sure. Thai fusion cuisine, some with double entendre named dishes pepper the menu. Ahh hah!...Hence the name of the restaurant as well.

Been coming here since their \"secret\" grand opening back in November. When Pho King Phonomenal had like 8? items on their menu.

Grand Opening: I think went thru and ordered 1/2 that menu. 

The standouts: Bang Bang Sliders with tender pulled pork that's been braised a long long time.  And Bangkok Burrito, that had rice simmered in chicken fat!... This place will definitely appeal to adventurous foodies and fans of Buddha Belly Deli (the popular Thai Fusion place in 89012 till 2016) 

The pho is different. There's bacon infused in there somehow. It did a great job warming you up for cold winter days! But I still prefer Viet style pho. With that said, hardly any pho in LV valley comes close to my favorites in San Jose.  Still, it's cool that there's pho in Hendertucky and I would order their Thai style pho again.
 
Dirty Chips is my latest obsession! Fried wonton chips, fried garlic, chicken skin, scallions, drizzled with bacon jelly and peanut sauce.

If you are a regular, then you'll be privy to the secret menu or secret menu item OTD, also regular customers can get on the rewards program.  Work for the COH? You get a discount too.

The staff here rocks! Everyone is welcoming, helpful and friendly, Owner/Chef Gary has a dynamic personality and very passionate about food and cooking.  Makes his own ice cream too!

Since November, this place has made awesome strides. And why I bumped my review rating. Started out in a tiny space with 3 tables and one long table where you can only stand.  Community support of our locals had this place standing room and line out the doors and demands for open later hours.  In three month time, Gary and staff expanded the dining area to accommodate larger groups and include a family friendly lounge area and open early evenings!   Something sorely needed here in downtown Henderson.

Finding this place is a b...  at first.. even though I was told when I called on the phone, it's right across the chapel, past Santa Rosa Taco Shop, I STILL drove right past this place in the parking lot..lol.....thank goodness someone's car alarm went off that was parked in front.  There's signage now, so ya'll shouldn't have no problem finding this place. Right off Water St..Visual cue, the city courthouse where you make the turn onto Basic...and bam you have arrived! Welcome to the Hendo Hood!"}
{"text":"Asian fusion and pho? In old town Henderson?! *record skip* PhoKing Phonomenal is in one of the least likely locations, but their fusion flavors are a welcome addition to the land of subpar chains and American-diner spots.

Came with a fellow Yelper (Chris V!) and ordered literally half the menu. Service was friendly and the chef/owner (Gary?) came out and spoke with us extensively about his background, dishes, and plans to contribute to the Vegas food scene. His friendliness and passion are why this review is rounded up! Well, that and the punny names of the restaurant and dishes.

BANG BANG SLIDERS: What I'd been looking forward to most, and probably my favorite. 3 small sliders pack a hefty portion of braised pulled pork with a slightly sweet sauce. Really enjoyed these and snagged the extra in our order for myself.
PHO KING PHO BO: Unfortunately I didn't find this phenomenal. It's a Thai take on a Vietnamese soup, but the broth lacked the body I was looking for and the noodles were on the clumpy side. Huge portion though, and lots of fresh onion, basil, and jalapeno to jazz it up.
THE BIG WANG: It's huge alright, we barely ate half of this take on a bahn mi. Great crusty bread, packed with meat, brightened by fresh acidic Siam style slaw, good lunch pick. The chef brought us a cup of sauce for dipping, and that made this even better. 
DRUNK AF NOODLES: Again, huge portion. You get your money's worth here. The kitchen even added an egg on top, which elevated the dish. But the noodles themselves were again clumpy and there was too little sauce for the portion, which came across as somewhat dry. The flavors seemed pretty solid, though.
ROTI ICE CREAM: Sent out by the staff, the ice creams are made in house. We opted for the cereal milk flavor, which was awesomely reminiscent of childhood. The chewy flatbread-roti accent was good, but chocolate filler was unnecessary with the other sweet components. Will be trying their ube version next time to see how it compares.

I haven't yet been back because it's pretty far, but I definitely recommend checking it out to try something new. I'm looking forward to seeing how the menu changes and expands; hopefully they'll keep the Bangkok Burritos until I make it by again."}
{"text":"Located in old Henderson, Pho King Phonomenal doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that stop you from visiting the best new Thai fusion restaurant in town. After a fun afternoon of day drinking my boyfriend and I decided we needed to fill our bellies with delicious pho and drunken noodles. I've been wanting to try this place because of the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted by the owner and a very friendly order taker (Leslie). We were sad to find out they had just run out of broth for the pho and were also out of the drunk AF noodles. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we ended up trying a variety of other equally delicious foods.  

First up we ordered The Big Wang and it was awesome.  It came on a huge baguette and was loaded with strips of tender beef, cucumbers, a spicy (but not too spicy) Wang sauce), and Asian slaw. Side note: The Big Wang was listed as the top 11 best sandwiches you must try in Nevada. I can see why, seriously!

I wanted to try the Bang Bang Sliders and figured they would be little appetizer sized. Umm wrong, they were HUGE! Set between soft pretzel bread these sliders were overflowing with tender pulled pork, siam slaw, cukes and onions, and that tasty Wang sauce. You get 3 large sliders so plenty to take home.

Leslie recommended the Bangkok Burrito and we thought hey why not? Another excellent choice. This monstrously huge burrito came stuffed with curry chicken, chicken fat rice, and bamboo shoots. Again we could only eat about a third of it and in the take out box the rest went.  

We were brought an order of Dirty chips on the house since they were out of the Pho and Drunk AF noodles.  They were like Asian nachos, were delicious, and we ate the whole damn thing with no apologies. Leslie also brought us samples of the homemade ice cream. My boyfriend liked the cereal milk flavor the best but passion fruit was my favorite. Total bill came to $38 but we easily got 2 meals out the deal. We're definitely coming back to try the Pho and drunken noodles soon! Like as in tomorrow.

This place really is \"Phoking\" Phonomenal!!"}
{"text":"Not your traditional pho restaurant but it was still amazing! I had the Pho Noodle Bowl & The Big Wang. However, it did take about 20 minutes to get my food to go. The people before me had their food and I was still waiting :'(..hopefully it'll be faster next time"}
{"text":"Very first thing till know coming here is that this place focuses on Asian fusion. 

The sole waitress was super nice and although it was busy when we got there, we didn't mind service taking a while as the rush died down. She gave us her honest opinions, was down-to-earth real, and truly cared about every customer. Plus she was easy to talk to.

I ordered their pho bo, bf got the big wang bahn mi and drunk AF noodles with beef to go for later. The first thing that caught my eye browsing the menu was that the pho broth noted it was a \"Thai style pho broth.\" The bahn mi was also mixed with Thai added to it.

Waitress gave us samples of the pho broth to try, piping hot. I have to say that it was the best pho broth that I have ever had. It was complete on its own! No need to douse the bowl with sriracha or hoisin sauce because it was full of flavor band not bland and still had a bit of kick from the jalapeno to it. The meatballs you could tell were homemade and juicy. It's not your normal pho broth, rather it's elevated!

The bahn mi was good but we weren't too much a fan of the bread. It came down to personal preference but the whole sandwich was still good. We asked for a side of the broth to dip it in, French style lol

Drunk AF noodles were also delicious. The noodles are super wide! Not too salty or sweet either. They were still good heated up at home.

The owner came out to meet us during our meal to check on us. Very personable person with a Thai background! We had a while chat since we were the only ones there. He's genuine about making sure his food comes out consistent and without shortcuts. He's planning on extending the restaurant into two, one side for hot dishes and the other side just for sandwiches. 

The kitchen has no microwave or toaster, just stove and oven so none of that microwave food is coming out of the kitchen here; you know it's fresh. 

I wish I can take just the broth home with me, I can drink that everyday. I suggest coming here at least once. If you don't want to make the drive here after, they do do Ubereats!!"}
{"text":"Alright, I'll say it...

It was \"Pho King\" delicious. I had the Bang Bang Sliders, and the Dirty Chips as an appetizer.

The chips were great as a starter, very tasty, and the sliders had the juiciest and best tasting pulled pork I've had in a long time.

I even went and tried the Tokyo Ramen, which let me tell you, had some rich, savory beef broth that I had the pleasure of taking home with me.

Overall, fantastic customer service, and just a great place to go and eat."}
{"text":"I was in Henderson for a 9 day course and our venue was within walking distance, so with the great reviews and a craving for noodles, I ended up here during my  lunch break on our first day.  This place was so Pho King amazing, we came back 5 times during that course and kept bringing classmates each time. It got to a point where we would have to RUN to the restaurant to beat the class rush the moment lunch break started.

Yes, everything takes time to prepare, but noodle dishes such as the Tokyo Ramen and Pho King Bo were faster since the broth is already made (and awesome).  Dishes that took longer were worth the wait, because they make everything to order.  Portions are a very good size and even though I should have shared some dishes and avoid post-feast sleepiness, I really didn't to stop eating anything.

Over the visits, I've had Tokyo Ramen, Pho King Pho Bo, Bang Bang Sliders, Phuket Fried Rice, and Drunk AF Noodles. 

Everything is SO delicious, like home cooked comfort food, with a fusion twist. I'm pretty wary  of fusion, but this place works. The fried rice is tasty and seasoned well.  Drunk AF noodles were sweet and spicy, which is a nice flavour combo on a wide flat noodle. Both soup noodle dishes are flavourful and carefully arranged. Like I've mentioned before, the broth is really outstanding. We were offered a sample on our first visit, and were hooked. It's rich and full bodied , packed with flavour from meat,  herbs and a bit of spice to it.   I really loved the Bang Bang Sliders. Three generous sliders stuffed with pulled pork, cucumber, and a spicy mayo.  I was so disappointed when I forgot that they were closed on Sundays. Having already had it twice that week, this was still the meal I wanted to take to the airport to eat before hopping on a plane home!  

This place was great for a bit of social decompression after eating, as there is a lounge like room to the side with a couch and very casual atmosphere.  It's not frilly, but I enjoy that the focus is on the food. The owner and staff were fantastic and friendly.  The owner came out to check in on our food and continued to make time to chat once the rush died down.  

 I can't wait to return and try more dishes during my training courses over the next year!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho place around town. I was so excited to have one located right here in Henderson. It's a hole in the wall, but amazing food. Great service and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Found this spot randomly driving around old Henderson. The name pulled me in and I had to check it out. Needless to say I left happy and full!!  Plenty of Asian fusion cool plates to choose from. The owner was also there and made us feel like we were long time regular customers.  I'm looking forward to finding the \"secret \" menu."}
{"text":"Still a great place to grab some tasty, creative grub!  The wait was actually less this time which was great!  I got the same sandwich which was still really good but for some reason wasn't as good as the first time.  We also got the thai tots and those were fantastic and comes with plenty to share!"}
{"text":"I had the pho deliver to my house and usually other pho places put your noodles and meat and all the extra stuff on the side and have the broth by itself, when I got my pho delivered to me it all came in one container, barely any broth the noddles were soggy and the meat isn't pleasant, I've never had a bad experience with pho until today. The pho is gross and the meat is disgusting I'm sorry and I usually don't write yelp reviews unless it's a must."}
{"text":"if not for the rave reviews of a trusted friend,  I never would have ventured into this slightly shady looking place in a strip mall in downtown Henderson. I'm so glad I did! The name aptly describes the experience I had.  The place is tiny and not much on atmosphere but the young lady that greeted us and served us was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. She recommended the drunken noodles with chicken and the Thai tots (our friend recommended these too).  A man came out of the kitchen and chit chatted with us and our little girl for a bit.  He was super nice and offered to put any spicy stuff on the sides  so it wouldn't be too much for our little girl and offered her some ice cream. Im pretty sure he was the owner and I could tell right away he was passionate about food and making people happy. Our food came out fast, fresh and phonomenal! They serve you in large metal bowls and paper plates and use plastic utensils but I didn't care one bit because the food was SO good! Portions are huge so we ended up taking some home. When we were done, the owner came back out to make good on his promise of ice cream. The flavor? Buttered popcorn with pork snow. Yes, you read that right.  I can't even begin to describe this crazy taste adventure that happens in your mouth when you eat this. You just gotta try it, especially if you love popcorn and you love ice cream. 
I was teetering between 4 and 5 stars because of the atmosphere but the food is just that good that I went with"}
{"text":"Very disappointed upon coming to this place to have Pho. My boyfriend and I came because it was close proximity to us and it had good reviews. Unfortunately the name of the restaurant is very misleading because it only offers one type of pho. It actually had two ramen selections as well which was unexpected. The rest of their menu items is a fusion of different Asian dishes. 
The pho we tried was subpar to say the least. My boyfriend is Vietnamese and knows pho very well. Some of the rice noodle was hard, the broth was bland and the meat they included was over cooked and scarce. There were only two meatballs and a few thinly cooked beef strips. 

The only highlight from this experience would have to be their customer service. Very accommodating and friendly staff! One of the cooks actually brought out a sample of their ginger lemonade and that tasted phenomenal. It's a shame I can't say the same thing about their Pho :( 
I'd still suggest saving your money and going to viet restaurant if you want a good bowl of pho for the same price."}
{"text":"so let me start off this review by saying I REALLY wanted to like this place....I absolutely love ramen and it's .3mi from my work-I got so excited when I saw it. that being said, I placed an order today on Eat24 for their spicy beef ramen with no mushrooms and no onions. well, shocker-the ramen had tons of onions and mushrooms in it so I spent the first few minutes after I got home picking those things out... Once I actually got to the point of eating the ramen, I was so disappointed! it literally tastes like packaged ramen noodles that you'd eat in college for 20¢ a pack...with the addition of like 4 pieces of beef (along with a bunch of other things I requested not to have in it). 
As for the \"pros\"...the guy at the register was very nice, and you get A LOT of ramen....so if you love a large quantity of cheap grocery store ramen for $9 (plus tip) then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"just had a pork sandwich there and their nachos and it was disgusting. I love to try new places in Henderson and there's never nothing good out here. Very disappointed and my sandwich was soggy when I get home and I literally live 2 mins away. Just sad. Their sample ice cream was good though. I feel really sick now"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly environment. The location is out of the way but with Yelp in my pocket this wasn't a problem. It's actually a plus because the low rent gives the owner the freedom to try new things. The pho was excellent! So many flavors and textures in the broth. I didn't even bother with the usual sriracha and plum sauce bath which is required for most bowls of pho."}
{"text":"We had the pho and big wang sandwich. Both excellent. The broth was perfect. Veggies super fresh. Service was top notch. The cereal milk ice cream is a must try!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good; service was friendly, the Nachos were flavorful, and the ginger lemonade was refreshing.

We were excited to discover a place that served pho so close to our house, but we were sadly disappointed.

The pho broth was SO bland!! Even with the added condiments and lime it was unsalvageable. The meat portion was also pretty skimpy. My husband mentioned the broth while he was paying and the gal said to come later in the day when the broth is more seasoned...okaaay, but shouldn't the broth taste good ALL day? 

We also ordered the Drunk AF Noodle dish. Well these noodles were salty AF!! The noodles were also congealed into a large clump. We picked through it and ate some of the meat and vegetables, but it was overall unpalatable. 

I personally don't like complaining about food at restaurants as I'm already unhappy and I feel it would just make things more uncomfortable and awkward. So I told my husband to just pay so we could leave. 

From the other Yelp reviews it seems people have really enjoyed their meals here, so it sucks that ours was so terrible food wise."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is.  The food is incredible and the staff is awesome.  The dirty chips is great appetizer.  The Pho and Bangkok burrito are my favorites."}
{"text":"Gary's Pho King restaurant is amazing. He has the friendliest staff and he is the most friendliest person you ever want to talk to. I have never tried Thai fusion food before and I was enlightened to good food. That means it was good. So go here and get some good food. I just got the Tokyo Ramen noodles with brisket and this was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"found out about this new spot from the yelp newsletter. Glad I did, this was definitely a great find. The spot is located just a stones throw away from water street so it's much closer than my regular go to pho spot. I grabbed some of the pork sliders, due to all the hype i heard about them. They were amazing, Larry was a real helpful & attentive guy. Even had the chance to try the cereal ice cream which was tasty and unique. Definitely want to come back again for the short ribs or burrito."}
{"text":"The chef really has a passion for food. I always come to this place whenever I feel like pigging out"}
{"text":"The Bangkok Burrito was fantastic. For you heat lovers it has a great spice level. Very juicy. Very flavorful. My husband got the Drunk AF noodles. Kind of bland. Not much to them. Won't order them again. 
The staff is so nice. Very friendly. Will return."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles are the bomb. The portions are huge. We also had the gang sliders. Don't let the location or exterior fool you. This is good good good."}
{"text":"Vegetarian pho was great. Four stars only because that's their only vegan option- hopefully they'll add some additional items to the menu!"}
{"text":"Just came back from my third visit to this new restaurant.  I have had the pho bo, the bang bang sliders, and today the big wang.  Each time was excellent, but the big wang sandwich is phenomenal.  Service is always friendly, also.  It is past time old town Henderson got a place like this."}
{"text":"The energy is positive from the time you enter until the time you leave. This place has tons of potential to be the best pho hang out in Henderson. The board games, and family friendly atmosphere keep it casual and comfortable. The customer service is awesome and the chef is making happy food. Vietnamese sandwiches and boba drinks are always a great pit stop.  just an idea"}
{"text":"Nice little place in old town Henderson, a mix of Asian American. Had the fried pork belly with chicken fat rice and side of egg and the big Wang sandwich, Vietnamese/Thai style Banh mi. Both were delicious! Big portion had left overs to go and reasonably price. Will be coming back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"This was my second time but there will definitely be more. So far I've had the PB&J noodles that was udon noodles, chicken and veggies in a thick Thai peanut sauce. More like a stew thickness and very tasty. Too much to eat so I brought about a 3rd home and later mixed it with soba noodles, also great. Today I went to try the Bangkok burrito but it was late in the day and they were out of tortillas so I ordered the Drunken A F noodles with chicken but also comes with beef. This was also very tasty and something I'd order again.Besides the food the staff was very friendly, helpful and sociable (nice chat) The order took some time but on discussion found they only use fresh ingredients and make you meal once ordered. Great  I have experience with some Thai places were most items are pre-prepaired and only assembled before you get it. I'll return soon!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! The woman working was friendly and made us feel so welcome. They were doing last Friday in Henderson so they were out of stock of some stuff. I wasn't able to try what I wanted to but I got some good stuff. I did try the riblets, sliders and  Thai tots. The owner came by and had said that they didn't have enough to make us a full order of the riblets so he refunded us but gave us what was left. What they gave us was actually a pretty decent so I can only imagine how much the full order would actually be. That was actually my favorite dish. The rice was flavorful because of the garlic. The riblets were crispy yet tender and sweet. Wasn't a big fan of the tots but it's probably because I'm a tater tot purest where I prefer plain. I would definitely go here again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place is too good to be in downtown Henderson but I'm glad it is! Try the Bangkok burrito! Get here soon before people figure out its amazing and Theres a line out the door. Haven tasted Thai food with this kinda of flair before."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. noodle bowls are huge and the staff is great.  i am super excited to see a restaurant like this in east hendrson."}
{"text":"5 for services; 1 for food! We ordered fried rice, Pho, and ramen. I could not believe they used instant noodle for Ramen. However, Waitresses were very nice, I wish food is a bit better. the \"chef\" should take some cooking courses on YouTube, it will help the business a lot since you already have good service"}
{"text":"Pho King Phenomenal was just that...! When we entered we were greeted with a smile and made to feel welcome. The young man at the counter explained the content and ingredients some of the dishes I was unfamiliar with. After a lot of thought we were ready to order.
We both ordered The Big Wang sandwich which has beef, Siam style slaw, cucumbers, mild and fresh jalapeños and cilantro topped with Wang sauce on a really fresh baguette.
While we were waiting, one of the staff brought us some complimentary fried wonton noodles and Thai siracha. It was delicious! Then, our sandwiches came. After a couple of bites, a broth for dipping our sandwiches into was brought to our table.  OMG, it upped the flavor combination by a hundred. I am pretty sure I made \"nummy\" sounds while eating.
To top it off, the owner asked if we would like to sample one of his house-made ice creams. My husband chose the green tea ice cream which was fresh tasting as well as delectable.
I chose the cereal milk ice cream; yep, it tasted just like rich cereal milk...Very unique and very delicious.
We WILL be going back as we are so pleased to have such an incredible restaurant and friendly staff and owner just minutes away from our home.
Pho King Phenomenal is currently in their soft opening and will be having their Grand Opening on Friday, January 13th, 2017...what a lucky day for Old Henderson!"}
{"text":"Not takeout friendly unless you enjoy cutting your own noodles.  Beef broth for pho was pretty good, but the ramen is totally worth skipping.  The wangs were totally underwhelming - save yourself some money and toss some wings in oil at home, then dump on some sweet and sour once crispy.  Garlic rice had no garlic.  Can't recommend."}
{"text":"I have never travelled so deep in Henderson, ever, but I did for the first time just to try this place. I live in Aliante in North Las Vegas so that should say a lot hahaha. I seriously had no idea where I was trying to find this place. I thought I made it to Laughlin bc I have never seen Henderson like that.

Anyway! Had this place on my bookmark decided to try it out. Don't let the outside of this place fool you because you'll be missing out on some good food. 

We ordered: 
Thai tea
Bang bang sliders
Dirty chips
Bangkok buritto

Definitely a worthy cheat meal. Everything was so good. I wasn't able to catch the name of the lady that worked there but she was so awesome, informative on the menu, and attentive. 

The Thai tea was sooo good, not too sweet. I only had a bite of the bang bang sliders bc I am not a fan of pretzel buns but the meat and slaw in between the buns was delicious! I think I would have loved it more on a toasted Hawaiian bun. I ate half of the Bangkok burrito, it was so good and definitely had the right amount of kick. If you are not a fan of spicy food this might not be for you. It was pretty much spicy chicken curry and rice wrapped up in a tortilla, messy but yummy. I also loved the dirty chips! When we ate the top and there was no more sauce on the remaining wontons the lady asked if we wanted more sauce on them and she took them back to do that for us. 

We were also able to sample the broth that they use in their pho and it was so good!! I can't wait to go back just to try their pho. She told us that their broth is more on the Thai side than the viet side so it's not your traditional pho. When I tried it the broth reminded me of Tom Yum Soup! Yummy. 

The food is good and the service was exceptional. I really hope this place succeeds.

P.S. they let you write on their walls, fun stuff!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the staff was EXTREMELY nice and welcoming! Customer service was amazing and the place was nice! There was an area where you can watch tv, play darts and so much more board games! That was a really fun area. But this was a place I went to for a quick bite to eat because I was starving! I'm sure the other yelpers who reviewed this place were right that their food is amazing but I specifically got the Pho because when I saw the name, I thought that's what this place was for? Only to find out that it's the only pho in their menu. And just like the other yelper I agree with, it was extremely bland. There wasn't really any flavor and the Thai tea tasted like literal whole milk and 2 drops of tea. It just wasn't Thai tea. I go to loads to pho places and this place just wasn't a pho place. Let's put it this way, it's a very Americanized Vietnamese place not even pho place because they don't really have pho. I'm sure their other food is good though! But I just wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"This place is really cool for lunch and the food is good. If they were open later I would be there more often. I can't wait for next time. I had the huge sandwich."}
{"text":"This review is long over due. Gary is whipping up some magic at this restaurant. No it's not a traditional Thai restaurant it's fusion in the best way possible. Meaning you take all the amazing things in Thai food and throw in some culinary genius. 

My favorite things to order and the Pho, Big Wang and the Bangkok Burrito. Their chicken fat rice is delicious and deserves a special mention. If you want traditional you can always do what I do and go the good ole soup and sandwich combo. Large Thai Pho and a BBQ grilled cheese that's traditional Thai right :) seriously it hits the spot every time. The portions are generous and everything is cooked to order. Don't let the naysayers fool you. This place is legit."}
{"text":"I'm new to Las Vegas and was craving actually good pho and came across this place. The service was outstanding, the owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I ordered the Thai style pho bowl, and it was delicious. I love Thai style pho, and this was the best one I've tried yet. So much flavor, they really do a good job. I brought my mom here yesterday, she loved it as well. My parents are coming in July, I definitely will be bringing them to try more of the menu. So excited!"}
{"text":"I tried the pho here and it was...odd. It tasted more like a BBQ rib soup and the fried garlic did not go well at all with it. I even asked for no fried garlic and they still gave it to me. I wouldn't recommend this place. I'd rather have the authentic pho soup"}
{"text":"I want to try this place in person as I ordered it for delivery. I ordered the dirty chips which were strange, bacon jam & peanut sauce sounded good but tasted weird together. The big wang was good, I think it would be better if the baguette was gutted it a little bit or a thinner baguette was used although it probably wouldn't be the big Wang if it was lol. The Siam slaw is strange and citrusy, my mom thought her big Wang tasted fishy (hahaha) I didn't get that from my sandwich. I did order my sandwich with extra sauce on side and the restaurant removed the sauce and put it on the side and forgot to put it in my order..
They called me and delivered it to my house! That was great customer service.
I definitely want to go here and eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"They were very excited to try this place doubt based on other reviews and very glad that we did. The menu has some very exciting flavor profiles and everything tasted great."}
{"text":"I do not know where to begin. I am absolutely amazed by this place! The food is killer and the portions are enough to feed a linebacker! 
I have to say that even though the reviews are great I was still a little worried about the food since I am a picky eater and while I like pho, it's not a must have to me. 

So.... Did I mention the name yet? Ummmm, truthfully there was no way I wasn't going to eventually end up  in here just based on that! 
Pho King Phenomenal (Pho = fuh for those who still don't get it.  What a great sense of humor the owner has!!!

Our server was very sweet and quite helpful answering lots of questions and making suggestions.

Ordered the Thai Tots and Bang Bang Sliders. Both of which are DELICIOUS!!! 
The Thai Tots are tater tots with seasoned beef strips, green onion, BACON JELLY.... Oh my gosh!!!! Bacon!!!! Jelly!!!! The flavor in this dish was it if this world!!!
The Bang Bang Sliders (just sounds fun rolling off the tongue, doesn't it?) were equally delightful! Pulled pork, slaw and seasonings on pretzel buns.

Quirky but super fun!
The menu is fun! Offering options such as Phucket Fried Rice and Drunk AF noodles. The hashtags are also cute:
#Phoface
#suckmynoodles


On a side note, I LOVE that you can write on the walls by the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Love it- great food and service. The ambiance leaves a bit to be desired, but they make up for that in taste and service! They also have an area for the kids to play on the side with games etc. very cool."}
{"text":"We stopped by the other week for lunch and have been meaning to do a review since then! So here it is!

The staff is SUPER friendly! The guy who took our order was so friendly and accommodating! We happened to go at the tail end of the lunch rush it seemed but not only did he bring us a FREE drink to have while we waited, (which was super good by the way) he also brought us 3 samples of their house made ice cream to help keep our kids occupied. There was red bean, green tea and cereal milk. The cereal milk was my favorite! But all 3 were really, really good 

The man who I am guessing is the owner came out while everyone was waiting for their food/eating and talked about the process of how he makes the broth, etc. You could tell of his passion for cooking and having good quality food. I appreciated that he took the time to talk to his customers and make that personal connection. 

The seating could have been a bit better, there wasn't a whole lot for larger parties. Most tables sat 2 and there were no high chairs. Nothing that would deter me from eating there though. They have a large long standing table which I assumed is common in Vietnamese style restaurants. 

Now let's get to the food. We ordered 3 different things: the Pho Bo, the Ramen and the Bang Bang Sliders. Every.single.thing was so delicious! My husband couldn't stop drinking the broth from his ramen. The broth in both the ramen and the Pho was perfect. I told my husband that this is going to be our new comfort food. And now that I am sick; it's all I want! LOL The sliders were delicious too! The slaw had a vinegar base but complimented the pork really well! We highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back and try more!! 

We hope in the future they will add some sort of kids noodle dish or something that will be a smaller plate for children. But even with that, they still get a 5 star cause the food was that damn good.!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff. Simple menu. We had the Pho King Pho Bo. Very large portion with plenty of noodles. Bacon is used in the preparation of the broth!"}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant. It has a super chill vibe to it. They encourage you to write on the walls near the bathroom, which are very clean so that's a huge plus!

They also have a great rewards program you use with your phone number. You earn stars for each entree and for every 7 stars you earn you get $10 off your bill.

I believe I came in on a soft opening and they had a simple menu which I appreciated.

I had the pho king pho bo and bang bang sliders.
The pho was interesting in a good way.It had a different flavor than the norm viet pho. I believe it's advertised as having a Thai twist. The noodles were really good and so we're the meatballs. The one thing I did not enjoy was the meat in it. It was pretty chewy.

Bang bang sliders were good! The value was also great -3 pretty big sliders for $8. The meat was really tender and I like the buns.

Also try the ube ice cream! I enjoyed how the owner gives out free samples for people to try it!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great but one star off because the restaurant itself needs some aesthetic adjustments."}
{"text":"Great food and a great price. You have to try their drunk af noodles. Their spice levels are on point and I've never ordered something I didn't like."}
{"text":"Pho King Phonomenal is a bit of an exageration. But it is good. Well, more of a mixed bag. Its time for a round of good news bad news.

The good news, I was greeted warmly and promtly when I walked through the door. The lady running the front could tell I was a newby and offered me a sample of the pho broth. The bad news, she was not able to answer the question I had about the broth having anise or licorice in it. I don't think it does but to be safe, I went with the ramen instead of pho.

The good news, they have great ginger lemonade here. The bad news, it costs $3.95. More good news, I got a few refills at no cost and even took it with me.

Good news, portions are large here. You pay a bit but you get a lot. I was surprised at how large the bowl of ramen was. The bad news, it wasn't my favorite ramen. The broth was OK but needed a little help. More good news, they give you sriracha, hoisin, sambal and pickled peppers to spice things up. I used some of the peppers and hoisin. 

Good news, the beef in my ramen was plentiful and tender. The bad news, there were a couple of pieces that were too fatty for my liking. I pulled off what I could. And the meat was cut thick. I prefer the beef in my ramen to be thin sliced.

The good news, there was a lot of noodles (which I've been craving despite the summer heat) and fresh MUSHROOMS (which if you know me you know I love). The bad news, there wasn't much more than this in the soup.

The good news, service is great here. The staff know their regulars to the point they ask about events in private life. This kind of neighborhood business shows its true colors in the way it treats its customers. The bad news, some of the stellar customer I recieved was due to errors being made. First, the beef in my ramen was cooked in the wrong broth so they had to re-make it. That took a few minutes but they kept me in the loop. There was another customer in there who was seeking a refund for an error she received and they accidentally refunded my card so they had to re-run my card. The silver lining here, for the inconvenience, I was brought a bowl of ice cream on the house. Their corn cheddar ice cream was recommended to me. It did not disappoint. Sweet and corny with a hint of cheese. I would like to taste a pinch of salt in there for balance but it is otherwise solid.

Some of the issues seemed to stem from the fact that the owner had gone home sick today. The staff working were trying their best but struggling in certain aspects. Like running a ship without a captain. They'll pull through with a little focus.

If I come back again in the future I want to try the Drunk AF Noodles. And I would not be opposed to trying the Big Wang sandwich. The menu isn't huge but there are a few interesting options left for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always on the look out for new asian restaurant specially Thai. We've been going around trying thai restaurant that our friends recommend.The only problem is that they almost have the same dish and you tend to get bored eating it. Although we tried a thai fusion restaurant in Las Vegas, it was a disaster. So when we heard about this place we were curious since the owner is thai but name represent Vietnamese food. Since this is a soft opening not expecting a full list menu, they got 7 dish so far, 5 of it we tried. The coconut ice cream AMAZING! Home made and the owner makes a fresh batch everyday. Tonkatsu slider, bread is soft and the tonkatsu is soft not like most tonkatsu we tried, its either too dry or to hard. It has apple slice and tonkatsu sauce dressing. The combination is perfect, the sweet taste of the apple compliment the saltiness of the dressing. The spicy tokyo ramen hold true to its name, its really GOOD. Trying their thai burrito  and pork belly next time! Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered pho and ribblets -amazingly delicious.  The pho was the best I've ever tasted and so fresh.  The ribblets were crispy and the garlic rice complimented it very well.

I'm glad I gave this hidden gem a try, it's so close to home and I'm quite happy."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and we were not lead astray. The name says it all! The Thai Vietnamese fusion food was amazing and the setting was relaxed. We tried 4 menu items and 3 specials and enjoyed all of it. The Pho was delicious. Gary the chef/ owner is very personable and passionate about his food. And Leslie the manager was friendly and attentive. We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, the pho is amazing, doesn't even need hoisin or any crazy sauces. The workers are super friendly and the owner even dropped by and said hi. He had something called Cheese and Corn ice cream. It's super good, definetly suggest it."}
{"text":"This place is so good and cheap! I had it for takeout and it didn't take long for the order to get to me. The pho came in a HUGE bowl lol not a letdown."}
{"text":"Whoa! Great sandwiches! Great name! Pho king ridiculously good! The lady behind the counter was super sweet too! Being from San Jose, I'm used to crazy good Vietnamese and other Asian food. This is a taste of home. So happy we found each other."}
{"text":"I never take the time to review but this one is worthy. Brand new Henderson local restaurant. Great staff and go over the top! Food is phenomenal as well. I will be a regular and wish them the best with their new business!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hidden gems I have stumbled upon since working in Henderson. Coming from LA, I'm used to culinary diversity and have had my fair share of Pho. This spot is amazing. The big wang sandwich and sliders are so damn good. Highly recommended and I try to tell everyone I know in Henderson about this spot. 10/10 would come here every day if I could."}
{"text":"A welcomed new addition to Henderson.

We stopped by opening day and tried the pho king pho bo and bang bang sliders. Both of which were excellent. The pho was so filling and the leftovers didn't go to waste. We were treated to Thai tea ice cream which was an instant favorite.

The experience was good and the whole staff was very friendly. A+"}
{"text":"I was craving a Ramen Noodle Soup and boy did this place hit the spot! Their menu is simple yet amazing. But the soup was so good I could literally cry. I wanted a certain kind without all the meat and they made it just that way. I can't wait to try everything off the menu!"}
{"text":"Nice and tasty little hole in the wall out in Old Henderson. My group and I were shopping at Galleria Mall when we got a hankering for some pho! 
My partner googled a spot near us and found Pho King Phonomenal. 

The place is near the Southern College of Nevada, in what used to be a small strip of stores building. They have a small private lot in what looks like a quiet neighborhood. When you first walk into this place you'll notice that there are two rooms, one is the main dining room with bar style seating, and tables. The other is a large lounge area with mix matched area rugs and furniture, complete with a darts board and T.V. 

The next thing you'll notice is the Big Trouble in Little China mural, and if you walk down the hall way to the restrooms, you'll notice tons of colorful writing on the wall from patrons of this place. It's pretty interesting. I'm kicking myself because as I'm writing this, I realize that we forgot to partake in the writing on the wall! 

Parents! There's a kids selection! Two or three items, but real nice if you ask me, as most pho places don't have a kid's menu. The waitress pointed the items out to me on the menu board on their wall. 

It was my group's first time, so as first timers do- we pretty much ordered what was recommended. We each got the Phonominal Pho, the tater tots, sliders, Thai coffee and Thai tea. The kids got Holy Cheezus, and a kids Ramen. 

The tots are awesome to share and a total crowd pleaser, even the kids enjoyed the ones that didn't have hot sauce on them. Thai coffee was amazing according to everyone, my Thai tea was a little too milky or watered down. Holy Cheezus was freaking awesome, but my six year old felt like it was cheese overload. So when he got down to the last slice, he began to pick the cheese off. The sliders were juicy and yummy according to our partners, I was too full and focused on my pho to take a bite of the slider...which comes in a set of three pieces btw. 

Now let me tell you about the Pho. The waitress was so kind to bring us a sampling of the broth before we ordered. We each agreed that it was flavorful and had a nice kick of spice in it. When we got our bowls, they kind of took the pruning and picking work out of it, as they already add the bean sprouts, and mint for you. Although, now that I think of it...I feel like my bowl didn't have any mint; however, I did taste the basil. Anyways, the noodles are so good-not flour tasting like other places and also not pre-separated like most pho places...you know! Like when you get your bowl and all the noodles are like stuck together as if they've balled them up and stuck them in bowls waiting in the chillers and then doused with some soup stock and garnishes right before you get it! I know, you know! 

Anyways, it's not like that at all! Seems like they cook everything together. The meat is shredded, which was pretty different and we were all pretty much content about the taste of the broth that we didn't squirt lime, or hoisin sauce, and hot sauces in it. I felt like there was too much shredded meat in my bowl, I ended up eating everything except for all the meat. The monkey balls are your standard meat ball, and it's whole-so they're big balls! 

Overall, the place was great. The bathroom in the lounge area is unisex- needed a refill on soap. The waitress was friendly and mindful of the kids, the food was awesome. Menu selection was minimal but very interesting. If you're looking for spring and summer rolls - don't go here. It's not your traditional pho place. I'd recommend this place for anyone who's looking to try something new! Next time I'm here, I'm trying the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Tried for the first time and was extremely dissapointed. I got the phoking pho bo and it barely had any noodles in it... like a couple strands. Mostly bean sprouts- how cheap can you be with rice noodles??? Paid like $10 for this and was not even full obviously. Went over to the Mexican place next door to make my lunch more fulfilling for a better price. It's like I basically donated $10 to their cause."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner tonight as we were in Henderson and looking for some decent food.  The reviews and pictures on Yelp looked good, so we decided to give this place a shot.  And after eating here...meh.

She had the Pork Belly, I had the Bangkok Burrito.  And for dessert, we had the churros and ice cream.  The pork belly was crispy and served with garlic rice (because they no longer had the chicken fat rice), but the rice was dry and the pork was a bit lacking in the flavor department.  No cilantro, no onion, no pepper...nothing.  It tasted ok, but it wasn't what you'd think of if you think of Vietnamese pork belly.

The Bangkok Burrito sounded great on the menu - panang curry with bamboo shoots and rice in a flour tortilla.  Unfortunately, for all the flavor that should have been in here, the 2 starches (rice and tortilla) sucked it all up.  Sure there was some flavor in there, but it needed something more.  It could have used some bell pepper or onion or something to make it pop against the rice.

The churros and ice cream also sounded good.  The waitress told us the churros were filled with cream and were topped with vanilla ice cream.  What we got was 2 churros bought deep fried that were cut in half and then dropped onto a couple of scoops of store bought ice cream.  It all tasted ok, but you could definitely tell that it was not fresh nor made by the owners.

The service was better than average; our waitress was friendly and courteous.  But it took forever to get our food; I think we waited for something like 40 or more minutes after placing our order to get the food, and then another 30 or so after ordering dessert.  The check came right away, though.  Good to see the money priority was on point!

It wasn't busy, either.  There was one other table in there while we were eating, and they appeared to be related to the owner.  3 other take-out orders were done while we there, and nobody else came in to sit and eat.  And yet it still took forever to get our food.

And on top of this, the owner was out in the dining room talking to everyone...but us.  20 or more minutes he spent talking to the table that I think he was related to, and the 3 take-out orders all got a \"Hey, welcome, how are you\".  Us?  90 minutes in the place and he didn't even look our direction.  We are obviously new customers, and we dined in, but not even so much as a nod from him to acknowledge we were there.

I think the thing that makes me go \"Hmmm...\" the most is the distinct lack of pho on the menu.  There was one pho dish on the menu, but for a place that calls itself PHO KING PHENOMENAL, you'd think there'd be a couple of different versions of pho to be had.  Nope!  The menu has one pho dish, and that's apparently all they have.

All told, things were both good and bad.  There were enough good things to think that other menu items might be better than what we had, but enough bad to make us wonder if the trip back here would be worth it."}
{"text":"We came expecting phenomenal food but was very disappointed on how tasteless the soup was. Firstly, it took forever to get our food even though business was slow.  Secondly, the meat was hard, tasted old, and gross, and the noodles were hard to eat. Thirdly, we found hair in our food. This place pho king sucked. Not sure how they got 4 stars on such poor quality food."}
{"text":"When only allotted a certain amount of time for lunch break, location and timing are key. 

Luckily, with this place, I am able to call ahead of time, give an eta, and the food is ready when I arrive. Love that quality customer service! Tracy is awesome! 

Not to mention the food is very good! All the flavors blend so nicely. I usually order the Drunk AF Noodles. I really only like them from this place. They are not mushy, or too oily, and I get way more vegetables, since I don't order it with meat or egg. Vegetables usually consist of broccoli, carrots, snap peas.  I will sit there and eat the whole bowl, which comes in a fairly large portion. 

Co-workers also love this place as it's nearby, and fairly priced. Can't really beat the good food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is very confused.  It's a sandwich shop, its a pho place, and it's an Asian fusion restaurant with three different names.  It was very hard to find (at night) since it was in a very dimly lit strip mall only to be found by a flashing police lights from a parked camera station.  Although the interior is just as confused and very off putting, the staff here was extremely helpful and hilarious.  It has a nice small town diner feel when dealing with the waitstaff.  

The Bangkok Burrito and the Drunk AF noodles were pretty legit.  The food and the staff is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"For the area YES, choices are limited. BUT... with a GREAT name, I was totally bummed. They really need to PHO-CUS on 1 thing! Get your Pho right before you venture off the yummy path with crazy ass ideas and crappy experimental food. (the owner is a little out there, nice, but different)
I want to eat GREAT PHO, not play games, not sit on the couch, write on the wall. (Though the wall thing is/was pretty neat, I mean graffiti neat) 
Tried it a couple times, and I think they need to re-group and have other grand opening. THE FOOD SHOULD MATCH THE NAME.
It seems nothing survives downtown Henderson. sad sad sad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a mom and pop, whole in the wall, but the food is amazing. I love the drunk noodles with chicken. I highly recommend trying this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Food is amazing, customer service  was amazing. They had a little place where kids can play board games, watch tv, eat lunch on the couch. Would definitely come back and try the rest of food on menu"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment twice already and both times the food has been good! I have ordered the tater tots twice since I really liked them. This time though, I ordered takeout and by the time the tatertots got to my place they were soggy. Maybe this is not the best dish to take home. 

The drunk noodles were very good! They are super tasty and fresh. I would def order this again! I also tried their sliders and they were super good too! This restaurant does deliveries during the weekdays."}
{"text":"So glad we were finally able to give this place a try.  Located in old downtown Henderson off Basic and Water St.  

We came here for lunch today and we're excited with all the fun menu options.  Not your typical Pho place which is nice.  Had a hard time deciding on which dish to try so I settled for the Garlic Pork Riblets along with some Thai Tea Boba and my husband got the Pho King Pho Bo.  Dishes were made to order and came out fast! Staff was friendly.  The Garlic Pork Riblets were crispy and sweet.  Such a good dish! Along with the fried garlic that was sprinkled over it.  Serving dishes are different but fun.  My husband enjoyed their take on Pho.  The cashier described it as not a traditional pho, but still had most of the same fresh veggies in it.  Both dishes definitely hit the spot and we will be back to try more!  The Thai Tea Boba was ok, boba was not as sweet as some other places but enough to hit the spot.  They offered us a taste of dessert at the end of our meal.  Corn and Cheese ice cream on top of a deep fried (home made) chocolate twinkie.  Corn and cheese flavored ice cream is not new to me as you can find it in some asian groceries.  Their take on corn and cheese ice cream is just like I remember it as a kid.  Definitely will have this ice cream again as well! 

So glad we have a spot nearby to satisfy cravings for bahn mi, ramen, pho, boba, and other awesome fishes.  Thanks for bringing these dishes closer to home."}
{"text":"Just left Pho King. One word \"flavorless\"! Worst place ever. I spent over $30 for two items. Money I wish I could get back. I had to remind the cashier that she never took my money. Makes me wonder how many customers have gotten away without paying. They seem to be so unorganized. There was a little bit golfing clean towels drooping them all over the floor. They don't even offer you any type of sauce to put on the flavorless food! I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The food is delicious! Broth tastes homemade, with a beefy marrow taste...amazingly garlicky. Def great hangover soup. The Dirty Chips are really tasty. But the best thing? Holy sh*+...the homemade hand churned Salted Butterscotch with Bacon ice cream.  This is what will probably keep me coming back. Gary, the owner/chef, was great and took the time to talk to us. Be warned though, this is not a place to come if you're in a hurry. He makes everything fresh to order so you'll wait. Call ahead your order at least 20-30 minutes. Don't miss this little hole in the wall joint, the food doesn't lack imagination!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Chef and staff are always friendly and welcoming. The food is outstanding. We can't get enough! Just found out they deliver too. Definitely satisfied custoners.
We have tried:
Dirty Chips - Amazing
Drink AF Noodles: Outstanding
Ramen: deep delicious flavor
Fried chicken rice- excellent
Chicken wings- crunchy and delish
Ribs and rice - huge delicious portions."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Henderson. The food is wonderful and the service is great! If you are lucky, the owner will come and chat with you about his concept and he even gave us free homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Florida in a November and found this place through Yelp! I've had the Tokyo ramen, drunk AF noodles, Thai tots, ginger lemonade and big wang and EVERYTHING is phenomenal! Great food, great portions, reasonable prices and great service! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Back open!! Changed names to Fork King. Same location, same people, SAME EPIC FOOD!!

They added some new menu items. New burgers are awesome. 

Come support this local business! Everything here is great."}
{"text":"Super tiny and cute they have a hallway you can take sharpie to and write your name! The food is delicious and the price is great as well as the service! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"As the other reviewers have already said,  this small restaurant serves excellent innovative Thai style fusion food.   Please note that is opening hours are only Mon-Fri 11am - 2.30pm, and from 5pm-7.30pm, and Saturdays fromm 11am to 7pm.  Closed on Sundays and in the afternoons Bettendorf 2.30 and 5pm.  This was not shown correctly on yelp and created a lot of confusion for us."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Food is great and staff is warming and friendly!! Will definitely be back for more food! Can't wait for the next time I go!!!"}
{"text":"So. I am not a Pho expert. Actually this was my first time ever having Pho. I ordered the Pho King Pho Bo and the Spicy Wangs (wings). Everything was great, service was excellent, staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Will definitely come back. About time we get some new restaurants in old Henderson."}
{"text":"First of all- YOU MUST PUT THIS INTO YOUR APPLE MAPS- it's AMAZING TO HEAR SIRI SAY IT! 
The husband /wife duo that own it have years of experience In food- they are local and he's usually there. I love that personal touch. The food really is f'n awesome"}
{"text":"This place is such a hole in the wall gem. We ordered the dirty chips, bang mi, and Thai burrito.  Above all, I love their great service and dank Thai panang curry burritos.

Don't expect decor like the Bellagio, but the food is amazing & the staff is great. And to be honest, I really like it this way better. There's lots of space to just hang out and chill while eating dirty chips and watching the NBA."}
{"text":"Food is definitely great, you'll no longer need to drive all the way into Vegas for a bowl of pho. Staff is courteous and energetic, as well as super friendly. 

My only, ONLY complaint is the owner really needs to learn to not yell at the staff in the back loud enough for customers to hear. Really makes it uncomfortable to listen to when you're just waiting for food. Has happened twice so far and haven't really gone back since."}
{"text":"Phenomenal is right! Their service = superb.

I've been wanting to try this new place for a while especially because it's nearby. Don't be alarmed by the outside because the inside is actually pretty big and clean. They welcome you in and give you a menu full of different options. The portions are actually pretty big. You pay at the front and then they bring you your meal. You can dine in, take out, and I believe they even do delivery (I saw a Grub Hub coupon on the counter). 

I got the Pho of course. They have all the essentials you need- lime, jalepenos, hoisin sauce, sriracha. Definitely worth getting especially if you're sick! I don't know if any other places nearby that sell authentic pho or ramen in these parts of Henderson.

Seriously, the girl at the counter is amazing and she's super friendly. She offered a taste of their ice cream which is made in house. They sell them there and I believe they are jack fruit, cereal milk, and ube. Pretty delicious if I say so myself.

They have a rewards program so they definitely will make you wanna come back! I sure will! I'm glad I've stumbled upon this little shop!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the drunk noodles and the chips. Looked so good when I opened these at home. Just flavorless and water-logged noodles and bland chips. I ended up throwing most of it away. I think this place at this time, gets a below average rating for poor quality of food."}
{"text":"WOW! We used to drive to Rainbow and 215 to get a good bowl of Pho and then my buddy turned me on to this place. For a hole in the wall i was super impressed!!! Their Pho is top notch and i crave it every week now. I am excited to try more menu items and i definitely will. Highly recommend Pho King Phonomenal."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Ordered the Garlic Wangs. 

These are whole chicken wings with the tips. They were really good on top of a pile of dressed up white rice. Crispy bits were tasty to gnaw on. The sauce was more sweet than spicy but good. The heat is about the same as a sweet chili sauce you would dip filipino lumpia in. Kind of obscure reference I guess. Lol

You get 4 whole wings. 

Can't wait to come back. :  ) They also have a rewards program.

The only reason it's not a 5...is because I have limited options there for drinks. I always order tea and coffee without sugar because I'm diabetic. Then I can sweeten it myself with something besides sugar...or sometimes I  order it with half sugar, but was told it's presweetened. My only options are diet coke and bottled water. I don't drink soda anymore and I drink so much water it's boring when I go out. 

But it's worth exploring the menu in the future!"}
