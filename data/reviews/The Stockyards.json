{"text":"Wow, this place rocks. The fried chicken is amazing and the baked beans are so good. I had the their homemade lemonade too. Make sure you sit at the bar to watch the magic, but be warned your clothes will smell like fried chicken, which is not necissarily a bad thing."}
{"text":"Had this quite a while ago. The fried chicken was really good and came with what seemed like an endless mound of fries... We also ordered a sandwhich which was WAAAY better than what I expected it to be. The people working there were also very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. Especially on the weekends for brunch. It's open style kitchen, so prepare to sweat if you dine in. I defintely recommend getting take out. 

I had their pulled pork sandwich on a kaiser bun. 

It was a lot more tangy and lacked the smokey factor than other pulled pork sandwiches.

It was ok, but not good enough that I'd go back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! 
The porchetta sandwich is a MUST! 
Tender meat, with crispy cracklings make for the most deelish sandwich! 
Top it off with the fabulous limeade infused with mint, and you're set. Sides are additional, and the sandwiches average around $9 but worth it for sure!
Call ahead and pick up seems to be the easiest I found so I don't have to wait, and I can perch and eat it at the side counter if i so wish..
 
FYI the fried chicken has received many rave reviews. I have yet to try, but if you are doing takeout be advised it will take 20-25 mins (as per the menu)

Did I mention yum?!?!"}
{"text":"Does Stockyards engage in racial profiling? 

Yes. 

The service is absolutely terrible. My friend and I are both black and we wanted to try out this place because of the reviews. My friend went in first while I parked the car. When I entered, the waitress said \"who's here for a table of two\". In response, we said \"us\", and she looked straight through us and had a full on conversation with the white customers next to us. After she finished her conversation, she said \"come here\". 

After she sat us down, we waited for almost 15 minutes and she didn't even come to ask for our orders. When she passed by us, I had to flag her down and tell her that we were finally ready to order. No apology for the long wait. Nothing. When she finally got our food after another 25 minutes, we noticed that she was much more attentive with the white guests in the restaurant than with us. When I asked for extra napkins, she made a huge \"sigh\" and hit my shoulder with the napkins. She was sarcastic, unprofessional and annoying. By contrast, she was so respectful and patient with the white guests. We couldn't believe it. 

The good thing is that they forgot to charge us for the orange juice and considering the shitty service we didn't remind them. 

The funny thing is that I usually tip above and beyond 15% when I receive normal to good service. Just do your job and I won't have a problem. But the service was awful and intentionally disrespectful. 

So, if you're white and want to have your white privilege re-affirmed, then you should goto Stockyards. Otherwise, non-white people and white people with a conscious should watch out for this place. If you want a 1940's, Mason-Dixon line, Plantation experience, then come to Stockyards!  

NEVER AGAIN! Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could generate a review based on likes and dislikes to keep it interesting for all your yelpers out there, I truly sincerely do, but today isn't going to be one of those days. I made a few return trips before deciding to hammer out a verdict. This place make my pupils dilate, my tongue salivate, and my chompers masticate. The Fried Chicken is top notch, allowing myself to stomach the guilt, as well as huge bites of perfectly fried southern comfort food. The pulled pork (Tasted by yours truly, and certified \"PRIMO\") was more than a treat, it was an honor. My fellow restauranteurs partook in sampling the briskett, while another comrade had the burger. I reserved myself from asking for a bite of their main dish, trusting their rave reviews, but let me say, I did steal a few fries, and I think this review is done, on account of me arranging transportation back to the stockyards. Near perfect."}
{"text":"Okay, here we go. 

Simply put, Stockyards is a pillar of the community. If you're within a 3km radius of this establishment, you better be stopping by. It's even worth the trek up the dreaded St.Clair hill aka Toronto's Everest (don't lie). 

The Stockyards is one of the only spots where if they ask you to grab a seat at the bar you're not furious. Having a chat with the cooks is always a hoot, TRUST ME. In terms of the food, it's all incredible. All the burgers are FIRE, the brisket is preposterously tasty, the fried chicken is a prooooooooblem, and the ribs are near perfect. 

The service staff are inviting, friendly, and just seem like the people you would wanna hang out with. Specifically, if you have the luck of being served by Big Mike T, the lightskin prince of V.O., you're in store for a blessed dining experience. 

***PRO-TIP*** 
GO ON SUNDAY FOR THAT BRUNCH THING WHERE THEY GOT THAT FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLE DISH"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I was a tad concerned about going here being that I don't eat a lot of meat.  Why did I go you ask?  It was one of my carnivorous friends birthdays.  I don't eat red meat, nor do I eat dark meat, so after finding out that the pulled chicken was a mix of both white and dark, that had been scrapped from my options too.  

But if you have a vegetarian friend (not one of those picky \"I'm not going to eat it because it was cooked on the same grill as meat!\" ones though), don't let them try to talk themselves out of coming here because they will be missing out on one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches ever. 

 The combination of aged white cheddar, green apple, and cremini mushrooms are a perfect combination with the nicely grilled sourdough.  The rosemary pressed into the top finishes off the perfect flavouring.  Others have been saying their sandwiches are overpriced - but with fries (a very healthy portion) my meal was $9.50 and very, very filling.  I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"4 stars for the coleslaw. We took our orders home and the chicken remained crispy so we were happy! Worth the line up I'd say!"}
{"text":"I gotta give props to the stockyard. I went here on a Sunday and they were serving brunch. Decided to go with the fried chicken and waffles. I've never had it in my life and I was pretty pumped to try it. It was fantastic a highly recommend. It gets pretty busy and the hours aren't great but it's a solid spot if you are in the area for sure."}
{"text":"Went for eat-in, they told us there was a 30mins wait, took a name and offered to call us if we decide to walk out for a coffee. Seated 20mins later. Menu is concise, I chose the BAT house special sandwich, delicious explosion of flavors. My friend took the classic burger and was still raving about it hours later."}
{"text":"Everyone has told me about this place and it lived up to the hype.

The southern fried chicken and waffles for brunch was the last thing I expected to order but they were incredible. 

Ask for the fried onion rings on the jalapeno burger, rounds of a mean burger."}
{"text":"I've been to Stockyards about a half dozen times for brunch, lunch, and dinner over the past year. Normally, I've had a reasonably pleasant experience. They typically do a great job with their food (the fried chicken and waffles are excellent, and the brisket sandwich is one of the best brisket sandwiches you'll find in the city).

However, this time around, they truly dropped the ball.

Craving a BBQ brisket sandwich, but also trying to stay true to my gluten-free diet, I asked if they had any gluten-free buns. The cashier told me they did not, but they would serve me the brisket in a lettuce-wrapped bun. This sounded agreeable enough to me, so I ordered it.

After waiting 15 minutes in their crowded front waiting area with about a dozen other patrons waiting for food, I received my order in a tiny takeout container. When I opened it up, I saw that they had just given me the brisket meat, without bothering to wrap it in a lettuce bun LIKE THEY PROMISED. So I ended up paying full price for the brisket sandwich ($12) even though I only got to eat the brisket meat. Not cool. 

Why did you cheat me out of my lettuce-wrapped brisket sandwich, Stockyards? Why?

PROS: friendly service, delicious food

CONS: over-priced food, cramped dining area, terrible fries, long wait times, duplicitous cashiers"}
{"text":"I don't care where you go, The Stockyards has THE best burgers within200 miles. And they're not even featured. Even craft burger doesn't compare. Not even mentioning their smoked meat which makes you really question why you'd wait 6 hours for a half-ass sandwich at craplansky's"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pulled pork via Take-Out. I was a walk in, so the 20 min wait did not bother me ... will recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Wait time is horrible. Service is very curt. Too busy, too little space. Decent fried chicken, but nothing I could get excited about. 

It would only be best for takeout, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Love this place... It stands up to some of the top rated burger joints in the city without the price point... Great taste and great price!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken was amazing--flavourful, quite crispy yet juicy. You can taste the buttermilk, and it works well in the recipe. That's a compliment considering how many recipes there are out there which purport to have an interesting ingredient like wine or whiskey in a marinade or sauce, but the end result is something altogether generic in terms of taste. The coleslaw was sublime with both sweet and vinegary flavours in good balance in an overall creamy substance. It may just be the best in the city. If they suddenly turned the joint into a coleslaw stand, I'd still travel from the far bastions of the city just to taste it again--yes, even Asiancourt.

The fries were string-cut and the least remarkable part of the meal. They give you so much that \"artery-clogging goodness\" loses its humour value. It's not like I'm going to take some of that pile of fries home to reheat tomorrow. But if you're going to eat fried chicken (and you will), you might as well do it the special way: eating some of the best in the city.

As for the restaurant experience itself, the bar-style seating has its appeal, but it's cramped. Sitting down by the wall is almost like sitting in the middle of the aisle--you know people are going to brush against you as they walk by. In terms of location and getting there, the TTC really shines with the time-based transfer program on St. Clair. You can go to this restaurant, eat, and get back on the TTC for one fare rather than two. It feels so convenient and liberating. Too bad it's not actually in the Stockyards area down the streetcar line; it would be more appropriate in terms of the name."}
{"text":"Stockyards is absolutely delicious. The interior is small and sort of rustic, with a nice simple color scheme. I live close by so Ive never sat down to eat there, I always take it to go. The staff is friendly and the food is just amazing (and sort of greasy so if that's not your thing, this restaurant is not for you). The chicken is great, the ribs are great, the burgers are great and the fries are great. You can get any item on the menu and it will definitely satisfy your hunger. Be warned though, sometimes they can get a bit busy and since it's a small restaurant you may have to wait a bit."}
{"text":"After trying to drag my wife there for a year, we finally hit The Stockyards, and I was not disappointed.  The fried chicken was amazing, and the homemade iced tea and lime-aid were nice too.  Just don't expect to have the normal restaurant experience, just get it to go, wynchwood bards is just around the corner.

I will definitely have to make my mom try this place out for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"i tried the southern fried chicken and waffles...the chicken was crispy and moist! so delicous! the only thing i would criticize is the waffle. although its fluffy, it could be a bit crispier. we also had the fried chicken breakfast burger. that was great too but watch out for the jalapenos those make it quite spicey. but if you go here...YOU MUST TRY THE HOMEMADE BISCUIT WITH HOMEMADE JAM...TO DIE FOR!!!!!! DEF. GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Love their classic burger and fried chicken. Delicious. We usually order pickup as the seats (high stools) aren't the most comfortable and the drinks options are rather limited. But the food is great."}
{"text":"Very Good!Amazing Fried Chicken!The Staff there was Very Organized,Friendly,and worked Very Fast.But the Restaurant is Very Small So You have to go At Least 4:30pm And Around 6:00 It Starts the Get busy.Another Reason You Should Come Early because there is not that Much Seats So if You come at 6:00 You will have no Choice But to Sit Facing The wall instead of Watching The Staff Cook( Which is another good thing about the Restaurant ) So when You are going out to Dinner with you Friend You have To Try it!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE barbecue, Cooked right in front of you. A hip vibe and great staff, but don't try to just swing by, it's always packed, so get ready to wait in line! Not an ideal place for people with food allergies, as it's almost impossible to eat gluten free or lactose free here. (But real real fun to cheat on those allergies )"}
{"text":"Claustrophobes might prefer take out at this teensy eatery that churns out some phenom fried chicken and ribs. Always worth the wait, but take out is best. Go gobble the BBQ goodies over behind the Barns.  Skip the burgers. Focus on what comes out of the frier and the smoker. The owners are delightful!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here to check out what the fuss is about.... I was specifically looking to try their barbequed pulled pork.  I'd say it was average, not so flavorful and little to no smoke.  I have had worse and much much better than this, will not go back for the BBQ.  I loved the charm and raw simplicity of the place though, very busy even at lunch on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken and waffles, we only come here for this and of course the buttermilk biscuits!! the only thing is the longggg line up! the place itself is very small and packed.. we came on a Sunday for brunch and waited 20 mins in line that was outside the door. However, i'd say the wait is well worth it. The staff is welcoming and friendly and the prices are average. I would go for the dirty bird for my next visit"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Toronto. Casual atmosphere. I recommend the Butter Burger but only of you love blue cheese :). Make sure you arrive at least half an hour earlier than when you want to eat because you'll definitely find a line up. They do not take reservations. This place is a must if you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"Unbelievable chicken and waffles.  Just do it.  Great hostess as well (who let us in near closing time). . Two greasy thumbs up."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is always super busy and it was no exception when we came here for a late lunch one weekend. The lineup was to the door and it was a bit chaotic. There seemed to be no system for the lineup and the cashier/hostess was unapologetic about it. 

We were running out of time so we decided to get takeout instead of waiting for a seat. We ordered the fried chicken dinner to share and waited for about half an hour before we got our food. The fried chicken was really good but the fries were soggy (mind you, we started eating within 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant). Maybe the food would have tasted better if we were able to eat in. 

Next time, if we're in area again, and if the lineup isn't long, we'll give it another shot. But the customer service (or lack thereof) left a bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in the city. At dinner, I stick to the fried chicken or the beast style burger. Both are phenomenal. At brunch, I have tried the griddlecakes, the chicken waffle, the stockyard breakfast sandwich, and the biscuits & gravy. Definitely the best southern style food I have had outside of Georgia. Great cooks, lovely service on Sundays. Good music, awesome vibes, lots of love all around."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been amazing.  The pulled pork sandwich was the best I've ever had (and I've had quite a bit of Texas BBQ), and the fried chicken is wonderfully moist.  I'll wait as long as I need to to get the food from here!

Can't wait to try the chicken and waffles for brunch!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a friend awhile back.

He had the fried chicken with waffles (still the best fried chicken in the city, it came with a great sweet, spicy, peppery sauce that was topped onto both the chicken and waffles).

I had the eggs tommy (2 deepfried poached eggs, butter poached shrimp, andouille sausage, buttermilk biscuits, hollandaise and home fries). Those deepfried poached eggs are to die for. Shrimp were succulent, moist, and oh so buttery. The sausage and biscuits were tasty, too. The one disappointing thing were those home fries. Many of them were just burnt but it did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the other components of the dish.

We finished it off with their beignets which were freshly deepfried and filled with dulche de leche. Arguably a contender for the best donuts in the city as well."}
{"text":"Holy Toledo that fried chicken is good!

Succulent, moist, good crisp, served with an insane portion of fries. I only wish they were as generous with the of cole slaw because it was amazing as well.

The flavour composition was fantastic. Not a single bite tasted \"ordinary\"

We also ordered the 1/2 rack the ribs - which was \"just OK\". The oink did fall off the bone, and it was served with a fairly acidic tasty vinegar/BBQ sauce, but i doubt i would order them again.

Was disappointed beef ribs weren't on the menu. Why the anti-moo people?

During our visit, burgers were flying off the grill and clearly a strong seller... perhaps the regulars know something we didn't.

Atmosphere - frantic, compact. You should experience the ambiance and eat in at least once, just keep the clothing minimal, especially if you face the grill. You is gonna get hot!  

Service was fantastic. The intimacy of kitchen / shared dining area made it easy to converse with the cooks. The head chef was efficient, friendly, spunky, and very helpful."}
{"text":"We split the fried chicken, brisket, pulled pork and butter burger 4 ways.  I wish I were there for the ribs too.  The chicken is brined perfectly to be moist and delicious while at the same time crispy goodness.  My pulled pork was tender and sauced generously without being a sloppy joe. The butter burger is a little over the top but man cooked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned well.  The brisket was probably my favorite while the chicken a close second.  It was super tender and enormously flavorful.   I wish I lived closer to try out the other menu items on hand.  The seating is tight but the food surely makes up for the scarce space. Service and atmosphere are hip with zero pretense."}
{"text":"Yoooooo. When I say The Stockyards has some bomb ass chicken, I'm not exaggerating!!! I've NEVER....EVER had fried chicken as succulent, juicy and perfectly seasoned as the chicken being served at this small local joint. I had a waffle with my chicken. The chili citrus glaze is damn-near like crack. OMG!! I gotta go back for more chicken...but I must try the biscuits. They were calling me."}
{"text":"Only one comment to add to other reviews:  Look for the owner when ordering the fried chicken (his picture is on the wall near the front).  The fried chicken is superior - I mean perfect - when he is there, but often slips when he is not."}
{"text":"For what they do, I think they are the best!

Lets start off with atmosphere....its loud, its hot, its noisy. We sat at the bar which I recommend. Its total fun. You get to watch them cook and interact. They are intense!

We got....the fried chicken dinner, the butter burger and the classic burger. The fried chicken dinner is AWESOME! 4 pieces of chicken (big pieces) lots of fries, hot sauce, yummmm. So crunchy and moist. Loved it. The butter burger was a huge draw for me. It was juicy (like run down your hand, lick your arm, die of a heart attack juicy). SOOO GOOD! The classic, was indeed, classic. Nothing to rave about but just a good standard burger.

So what can I say....I'm a fan of fat, entertainment and good prices. A+ From me."}
{"text":"Oh man this place is delicious. Even though the service is sometimes lacking, and sometimes they run out of food, if you hit it on the right night you'll have the best BBQ in the city."}
{"text":"Great burger. Nice crust, loosely packed, flat top cooked. A little bit greasy but sometimes thats ok. A mountain of fries, toppings were nice.

I'd say its a liiiiiitle bit satly. But with the fatty meat they use it all evens out and makes a nice griddle style burger. No complains whatsoever. There is a reason this place is packed sunday mornings.

I've had the Dirty 30. To be honest, its just too much for my liking. I prefer the standard."}
{"text":"Their chicken and waffles is delicious, though I find it's best shared cause I find the sauce overwhelming after a while. The biscuit and gravy is really good too, but also best shared. Both dishes go really well with their freshly made iced tea. The service is always friendly. The food comes out fairly quick if there isn't a huge line up for take out.       

What I don't like about the restaurant is how hot it is in the summer! They have a couple of air conditioners but they're not powerful enough, and sometimes they're not even on despite the heat!"}
{"text":"Eat at The Stockyards. That is all.

Need more? Their burgers are the best around -- the Animal's my fave -- the pulled pork is great, and the pastrami is awesome. The fried chicken is the best ever!

The only drawback is the size. It's small, with a bit of chaos as people waiting for seats and take-out mill about."}
{"text":"I hate that I ever ate here. Addicted for life. Best burger I've ever had. Best fried chicken. I only wish there were a 2nd location in the east end. Actually - no I don't. I would double in size if that happened."}
{"text":"After having this place built up by co-workers as an almost religious experience, my first trip to the stockyards yesterday was just ... Meh... 

I had the Animal Burger with Fries and a pop.. it cost me $15 which seemed a little rich.  Honestly, the burger tasted like one I've had from In 'n Out Burger in California - tasty, just not $8 tasty you know?  The Fries were fresh and cooked to order... Very good and you get enough for you and 3 of your friends.   They were $5....  I would have loved to get like 1/4 of the amount for $2? 

Co workers were floored when I told them it's okay... but didn't rave about it like a loonatic - that's what I tell you too, fine yelpers.   It's okay - tasty even, but a little overhyped."}
{"text":"chicken and waffles....that's all i'm gonna say...

okay not really....OMG...can't say enough about the chicken and waffles

get the 4 piece of chicken which is enough to share for 2 people.

1 draw back....restaurant needs to seriously expand and take over the spot next door...seriously.  The wait times might turn people off...but if you can wait it's sooo worth it

sandwiches and burgers are good too"}
{"text":"Tasty and very nice staff, but I don't know if its worth the lineups. Ribs are the best choice if they are available."}
{"text":"Loved The Stockyards for its meaty lunch and dinner offerings, but breakfast: biscuits -- OMG!

As a native of the northern reaches of the American South, this is the only place in TO where I can get my fix of home cookin' without having to drive to a Bob Evans south of the border (BE is a chain restaurant, so not really home cookin', but it'll do after months and months without).

The food is exceptional, for sure. But there are a few reasons not to give 5 stars (I'd give a 4.75 if I could):

As a native eater of this cuisine, the menu doesn't combine into the expected plates, leaving me feeling like no matter how tasty, something is missing. Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent, and I appreciate the creativity that The Stockyards brings in presenting this cuisine to Toronto. But I'd love the option of biscuits with chicken instead of fries (sadly the Stockyards fries never really do it for me and the coleslaw, while tasty, would be unrecognizable as the dish of that name in many places south of the border); or a chicken fried steak not as part of a breakfast burger (and certainly with a biscuit and not an english muffin) and with gravy and mashed potatoes; or a side of collard greens cooked in yummy Stockyards bacon. The waitress who got me honey for my biscuits made my day -- that's the classic combo, and gorgeous as their fruit preserves are, it's just not the same.

Also, would be nice to know what the breakfast hours are -- getting attitude for showing up before 11 am and not wanting lunch could be easily avoided. We like your food, and we'll get up earlier if only we know we have to.

All that said, my life changed when they moved into the neighbourhood, and it has only gotten better with the addition of breakfast! Yum!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for burgers and fries! 
The chicken is breaded perfectly, it's really juicy and moist.There's no better place for fried chicken.
The brisket sandwich was a little disappointing as it lacked flavour..
Too bad they close so early, I'd be grabbing midnight snacks there all the time."}
{"text":"Chicken is okay; tasty yes and full of grease both chicken and fries. Heard so many hype about their chicken;  but it just okay. A bit expensive. Small place. Smiling servers. Will I come back? Nah I can make the same tasty chicken at home. Not worth the drive coming from east end."}
{"text":"very disappointed!! we traveled from scarborough for  an hour only to fund out they close at 2:45. i made sure i called before coming because the travel aint easy. when we got there all she said was \"you know what we are already close\" and i was like i called before i came and you said your open and you close at 8. she even blamed me for not asking the right questions. i asked \"are you open today?\".......... me,my husband and my 3 year old ended up starving!!! you don't just say your closed!!!!!!! unacceptable!!!!!! don't blame your customers for your inaccurate information!!!!! that is why I called to ask because i want to be informed of your hours. a humble sorry would have been better."}
{"text":"After hearing such rave reviews about this place, my friends and I decided to pay it a visit this past Friday.

As mentioned numerous times here already, the place is tiny and packed.  All I could think of while I was waiting was this better be worth it.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.

The ribs were certainly cooked correctly, as they were quite juicy.  However, my friends and I agreed they were quite bland.  The bbq sauce did add some flavour, but not much.  As much as I generally detest chains, I think the ribs at Baton Rouge are much better than these.

The fried chicken was passable (the hot sauce helped), but again, I would have to give this one to the chains (KFC, Popeyes) as well.

My friends thought the brisket sandwich was pretty good, but to me, it was also so so.  I did like the fries dipped in hot sauce though.

The final verdict: overhyped and underseasoned."}
{"text":"Good overall place. Decent price and not too pretentious. Takes a bit if you want to eat inside, but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I come to the Stockyards regularly. The food is great but the service is shocking. After my last experience this Sunday I just had to write a review which I don't often do. I was served by a older woman wearing a Stockyards hat. Not only did she completely ignore us she reeked of alcohol. Isn't this a family business?? With no liquor license on top of it all?  Whoever is running this place needs to get some control under there staff."}
{"text":"Stockyards - my favourite brunch spot.

I always start with the daily beignets ($6) which comes with four per serving. They fry them fresh to order and are topped with powdered sugar. Delish!

Another dish I always get is the eggs tommy - deep fried poached eggs with house cured andouille, butter poached shrimp, on buttermilk biscuits smothered with hollandaise ($13). The deep fried poached eggs are perfectly runny in the middle and the dish really is smothered with a tasty hollandaise. My favourite part is the buttermilk buiscuit, the perfect vehicle for an eggs benny. I often order the eggs benny whenever I go for brunch and stockyards has my favourite, hands-down! My only complaint about this dish is the homefries... they certainly look better than they taste. 

My boyfriend usually orders the fried chicken and waffles - fried chicken over Belgian waffles with chili maple molasses citrus glaze ($12), which comes with 3 large pieces of fried chicken on a large waffle.The fried  chicken tastes absolutely amazing covered in the maple molasses citrus glaze. I really love the combination, but it's certainly not for everyone. I actually prefer the chicken and waffles over the regular fried chicken dinner.

Other things to keep in mind:
- The place is small, with counter-seating, so it's not recommended you come here with a big group 
- Waits can be long"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do i begin with this place?

This is a larder restaurant, so all you calorie counters dont even bother. It tastes so good though, trust me.

Ive had thr fried chicken here and was a big fan , but i tried the beef brisket sandwich last night with shoelace fries and was blown away.

Tender pieces of brisket with garlic, franks red hot, carmelized onions, cheese and a nice fench sesame baquette made this place a grand slam.

Food took 15 to 20 minutes to prepare, but it was worth it. They take debit here. Id go back for sure."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband for brunch.  It's a tiny restaurant but we were able to get seats so no complaints.  I got the chicken and waffle...the chicken was super tender.  I wish the skin was crispier though but it was drenched with sauce.  I would say the chicken and waffle at The Dirty Bird in Kensington is superior but it was still pretty good.  My husband got the dirty bird dish and he enjoyed it.  
The servers were really friendly and kept refilling my coffee.  We'll definitely return and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"The best thing on their menu would have to be the bat sandwich. Spicy and delicious in all the right places. Definitely hits the spot. Good food, good vibes, great place."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ. Where have chicken and waffles been all my life. 

Infuckingcredible. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Best chicken in Toronto!! The staff is AWESOME!!! Try Brunch on the weekend...Blog coming soon to BigAssKid.com"}
{"text":"Limited seating and had to wait 45 mins, but it's well worth it!  Fried chicken was so good! Had the ribs too but a couple of the pieces were dry...but i blame myself for going close to closing time.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Thursday. I had read the good reviews and wanted to give it a try. I wanted a late lunch so I went at about 330pm and it was very quiet inside. There were only three other people there eating. I ordered the Fried Chicken Dinner and sat at the counter with a Coke to drink. I got my food fast and the chicken was top notch. There was one drumstick and three pieces of white meat and it was all tasty. The fries however were the opposite of good. They were overcooked and crunchy. It's okay for fries to be a little crispy but crunchy is bad. I left most of them in the cast iron frying pan that they served my meal in. The staff were very friendly and the dining area was clean so no complaints there. I will give it another shot sometime because the chicken was that good. I just hope the fries were a fluke."}
{"text":"Our last experience was very bad. We had ordered the fried chicken and the Green Chili Pimento Cheese burger to share. As we cut into one of the fried chicken pieces, bright red blood started running down the meat of the chicken, we let the woman behind the counter who was cooking know that the chicken was not cooked properly and her response was, \"it's just a vein\". At no point were we offered a discount, a new piece of chicken or even an apology. We were so disgusted we could not finish our food and the lack of care shown by the staff was disappointing. We will never be going back and I would not recommend Stockyards to anyone!"}
{"text":"A great place in Toronto for fried chicken. Their pulled pork isn't bad either. Its always busy so best get your meal to go."}
{"text":"Two words. Butter. Burger. Delicious and juicy. No need for fries or anything else. Definitely order ahead and pick up to save time."}
{"text":"Ok, smoked ribs can be greasy, smoked chicken all the way.  The burgers top drawer, fried chicken rates with the best I have had in the southern states,  Fries can leave something to be desired but still decent.  

For a good meal out with the boys, elbows deep in protein... good times"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by The Stockyards on St Clair  Ave W one Saturday afternoon and give this place a try, what a mistake. I ordered the beef brisket with fries. My order came up to $19 and some cents. The  lady that took my order was polite enough. The shop is extremely small so your best bet is to take your food to go. I waited about 30 mins or more for my order, which I wasn't happy about at all. When I finally got home and tried the brisket, I wanted to barf.  It tasted like vinegar and mustard on bread. The beef had no seasoning whatsoever. It was the worst damn brisket I have ever had. Don't waste your time ordering it. I will never step foot in that place again. I'm not sure why that brisket is still on their damn menu. Maybe I should have tried the fried chicken instead."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is out of this world. Fact. 

Today's batch of fries that I got with my order were overdone, but usually my once per month order is amazing. I'll forgive them this time ;-)

I usually get takeout, rather than sitting in... no complaints there, service is awesome, quick, and professional. 

Also, they should stay open until (at least) 10pm."}
{"text":"Worst fried chicken ever .
Came here after I read the reviews .. Food was so bad , I had to stop for a pizza on the way home."}
{"text":"Really interesting place to shop at  its basically a mall with a strip mall outside , a bunch of good places to eat at."}
{"text":"Pretty lousy experience. Firstly, the place is way too small to sit down and eat comfortably in - they only have high top seats and it just makes the entire experience feel very rushed and stressful. Secondly, the prices of the food are insane. I remember getting a side that was like 8 bucks - nuts! Finally, the food is very very average. Overall this place tries too hard but really isn't great."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great limeade & fries. Fried chicken: moist but a bit greasy and bland.
Would have loved to try the ribs, but they were out!
Rib tips: tasty & FATTY!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny place.   We came on a Sunday evening at 6 and managed to get seating for 2 right away. 

We were greeted with smiles and pleasant service. 

Ordered half rack of ribs,  a brisket sandwich,  fries and  a coke. You eat right in front of the line cooks. Served by the cook who was also really nice. 

Food was made perfectly and I enjoyed every bite. 
Had to take half the sandwich to go because I was just too full. 

It's on the loud side but not in an overbearing way.  It's just a small place and the staff communicate their orders verbally. There was no music. Could hear the person I ate with workout having to raise my voice. 

There are no tables,  it's all bar style seating. Which is nice in the way that it's all about the food. It keeps the turnover of guests high too so you probably don't have to wait as long to get a seat if it is busy. 

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My favourite, hands down. This is the type of restaurant where a seat at the bar, grants you access to a conversation with the kitchen staff. Everything is fresh, so much so, they run out of food if you come too late. Probably the best Buttermilk chicken, and ribs I've ever had. Try the specials, and drink the Limeaid.
Tip well because I don't know how they manage the frenzy of customers. But their always friendly staff definitely earns it!
Be prepared to wait... but don't worry, it will live up to the hype.
Take out is faster, but waiting until you get home to eat it? Just can't do it.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"One of the few menus that I have to pour over for what seems like hours because if you're hungry you will want to eat everything on it. The pairings and combinations are inventive and delicious. Make sure to go on an empty stomach because the servings are also pretty big. Of course the chicken and waffles are where its at, but there is a ton more to try out.

Because of all of the publicity this place has it can be really busy. The two times I have gone I waited 20 mins or more for a table for three !"}
{"text":"Just when you think things couldn't get better, The Stockyards comes up with a new menu item and gives them out FREE to celebrate their 1-year anniversary today.

We were each the lucky recipients today of 6 plump rib pieces smoked then doused in a vinegary BBQ sauce. These succulent meat nuggets had luscious appendages of fat that quivered like a \"17th-century courtesan's inner thigh.\"[1] I like these much more than their standard dry-rub ribs. They were so good Jing K.'s dog ate the rib soaked paper napkin right off my lap.

In addition to the rib tips, I had the smoked trout sandwich. It was very good, but bordering on too salty for me. I think I'll stick to the pork and chicken at The Stockyards.

So, Happy Birthday, Stockyards. Many happy returns. I'll be back.

{"text":"After hearing all the rave reviews, was really excited to try the food. Went on a Wednesday night with my husband and sister. 

Wednesdays are probably slower nights as we got seated right away. Both my sister and I ordered the fried chicken meal and my husband ordered the butter burger (beef patty with bone marrow and blue cheese).

The orders took about 30mins to arrive which is surprising as the restaurant wasn't that busy. The skin on the chicken was the best part however the meat was dry. The butter burger was also underwelming as well. The burgers at burger's priest is much better and have better value.

Overall the three of us left disappointed."}
{"text":"As a BBQ affeciando, I had read so many reviews and I had to check it out. I arrived at 4:50 p.m. and waited 10 minutes before anyone came forward at the front of house. Finally a very young and mindless chick arrived and suddenly decided to take orders. She addressed people that arrived well after me and they had the good sense to tell her that I had been waiting the longest. I placed my order only to discover they were out of everything. The menu was so limited, I only had burgers or porcetta to choose from. I asked if the porcetta was smoked...she told me it was. She was wrong...it was good but not great. I waited another 20 minutes before my order was ready. The cole slaw although fresh is medicore. If you want really good BBQ you have to travel to Sweet Smoke in Oakville...they never run out of anything and the menu is fantastic. The baked beans are out of this world. They also offer an amazing dessert menu made in house."}
{"text":"There's usually a bit of a wait to get a seat during peak hours, but it's sooo worth the wait.  The food here is bomb! 

The green chili burger is amazing...and I'm not usually even a burger person.  It's a little spicy, meat is seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the fried onions on top make this burger perfect.

The fried chicken is also amazing...can't really go wrong with fried chicken right?

I also really like the biscuits with sausage gravy on their brunch menu.

Although the space is a bit cramped, the staff are always super friendly and attentive, and the food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They've got great burgers. I'm always torn on whether to get the beast style burger or the butter burger. The brisket is very tasty as well. Big recommendation. Good with and the people are really friendly."}
{"text":"Soooo gooood.  We went here quite some time ago, before I developed a love for burgers so I had a sandwich and that was amazing.  My husband had a burger and continues to insist it's the best burger he's ever had, and this is someone who regularly frequents the major burger players (burger's priest, holy chuck, big smoke, etc...)."}
{"text":"I really really don't get all the praise for this place.

Have been twice now and both experiences left a bad taste in my mouth. Close friends live about a 10 minute walk away, on a visit at dinner time (twice) we decided to walk over and get take out.
First time I attempted to order ribs but they were sold out. Opted for the pulled pork sandwich (which everyone raves about) and fries on the side. Waited for about 20 minutes, received our food and walked home quickly to enjoy it. During the 10 minute walk my sandwich was pretty much rendered inedible. 

The pulled pork was over-sauced, seeped through the bottom bun, making it impossible to pick up, because the bun was a cheap Wonder bread style grocery store bun. Come-on guys, if you are going to serve saucy pulled pork you need a sturdy bun, one that can hold up to all that sauce! It's pulled pork 101. The fries were good, but lukewarm as well. The addition of coleslaw on top of the sandwich was good.

Tried again with the ribs about a month later. Sold out again. Opted for the porchetta sandwich with grilled rapini. And fries. Better choice than the pulled pork, good crackling and a garlic aioli. Not as good as Porchetta and Co. but still good.

So why the two star review? It's a combination of lacklustre food, the fact that they have no seating, don't think about how their food will transport (to people's homes considering they don't have seating), and also the fact that they constantly sell out of their popular items. Toronto has other great options for really good BBQ."}
{"text":"Reminded me of when I lived in Texas! The place smells amazing and the food lives up to the smell. Its a small place with bar style seating for aprox 25 ppl, I went on a tue night at 7:30 and had to wait 15-20 mins but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"A place in TO that serves fried chicken? Really? And it doesn't come in a bucket? Really? Yes! If it's FFF (fried chicken Friday) and you're looking for your fix, look no further than the Stockyards. Yeah they have some other BBQ items on the menu and they're all really good too, but the main attraction here is their buttermilk fried chicken. It's made to order and not sitting under a heat lamp waiting for some poor soul to come and put it out of its misery. The skin is of course crispy, the meat is juicy, and the hot sauce brings it all together! It takes about 15 minutes to make, but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, slightly on the heavy side, but it actually tastes like proper fried chicken....and that there is chicken in the chicken as opposed to ground up questionable stuff. Brunch biscuits with gravy....whole other world....I don't know what they do to that gravy but thinking about it is making me drool. And the pulled pork, yumyumyum."}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken. Had a small wait for our group of three, but definitely worth it. It's a little out of the way for those living in the heart of downtown but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Do not go here! The food is served cold and you are made to feel very unwelcome! I have lived in Toronto for over 12 years and this is the worst treatment I have ever received in a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed given all the good reviews. I really don't understand all the hype about that place. The chicken doesn't taste anything special, the taste of the meat is plain, no spices at all on the meat, the batter is greasy and not as crispy as I was expecting. It's nothing that I couldn't have made at home. I think even the chicken at Popeyes or KFC are more flavourful. I guess that was the first and last time for me."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Saw it featured on 'Drive-In's, Diners and Dives'. Went down and tried the Brisket and the Pulled Pork. Both were 10 out of 10's. Great spot for BBQ."}
{"text":"Waited 3 years to try this place as the reviews were so good. Had the fried chicken dinner. Tasteless, not moist. Not memorable. Shoestring fries were good. Served with tobasco sauce for dipping (most unimaginative condiment ever) and inedible coleslaw. I am a lover of good food. Extremely disappointed. Love the hacks that say this is the best meal they've had in the city. Love to see their homes and their kitchens. Never will eat here again."}
{"text":"Not much more I can say about this place that others haven't already said. I love this place. The food has always been nothing but amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken dinner and shared it with a friend. It was good, but the price is quite steep for fried chicken. I would probably not pay the premium price given that I didn't find it THAT much better than other fast food joints serving fried chicken. But I would still  come back since I do like it"}
{"text":"Random drop-in for Chicken& Waffles off the Brunch menu. Portion was generous, chicken crispy and flavorful. Definitely going back in the future."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Brisket tasted like the beef has gone bad!!  Not sure if it's the garlic mayo, but something doesn't taste right.  Chicken and waffles, apparently was good, but didn't look special. My suggestion, head down to the beaches, and go to hogtown smoke house.  Now that's a brisket!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the burger and the fried chicken. The burger was just ok. It was nice and juicy but the flavor was lacking something. The fried chicken and waffle was good but not the best I've ever had. Overall this place is solid."}
{"text":"I finally came back for a sit down meal and now I know what all the buzz is about! I got the fried chicken with waffles and I have to say that's the best damned fried chicken I've ever had; perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy and tender inside, well seasoned, and most importantly: not so oily that I can fry another chicken in the drippings.

The waffle was also excellent although I wouldn't say it was standout. I recommend getting the spicy sauce on the side as it made my chicken and waffle rather cool by the time I was halfway done. Or I guess I'm just a slow eater. I stole some scrambled eggs from my friends and those were excellent as well. 

Overall an excellent experience. I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"This one was a hard one... I LOVED the food, but man, that meat baby stayed with me for THREE DAYS. Not only did I wake up at 4am in the morning feeling like I had rocks in my stomach, it literally was three days before I got rid of it. For those of you cringing, count yourself lucky that that is as gross as that description got. I had a much more graphic way of explaining it but decided to tone it down a little for the TMI Police.

So, moving on...

There's little in the way of seating at this place. Well, there's a moderate amount but like any popular food joint, you're not doing it right unless there's a queue out the door and people willing to wait it out. I ordered the double burger (and was surprised that it impregnated me with a meat baby, I know, not exactly the sharpest tool in the box) and it was delicious. The bread didn't stand a chance with all that cheese, mayo and GREASE, but oh was it fabulous. It handled it all perfectly, and only really gave in towards the end, soaking through in the spots where I was clamping down on it with my fingers.

The beef ... my God, the beef! I've had some nice burgers but this was exceptionally good. My boyfriend had the pulled pork and he said that while it was good, there was a lot of sauce, which kind of overpowered it all. He would have liked to have been able to taste the flavour of the pork a little more. Our friend had the fried chicken, which he devoured. Watching him, my boyfriend went back in and got an order to take home. Watching them made my tummy want to cry but they said the chicken was great.

I also ordered one of their cute lemonades. They come with a little papery straw that discourages nursing your drink (it just turned to muuuush!) but the pop was lovely.

Pricewise, it's a little on the expensive side, considering it's \"just a burger.\" Really, though, you need to go to realise it's more than a burger. It's fabulous. Minus one star because there's been no child support for that meat baby I was saddled with. I was not sorry to see the back of that!"}

Dish To Try
Brisket Sandwhich

Details
- Brisket sandwhich was quite good, i'd give it a 3.5 stars. 
- Fried chicken was 3 stars, but is not tastier than Popeyes, 

- Ribs is 2 stars - it was cold and dry, in fact i actually made the effort to go back and return them for refund despite ordering takeout (we went to the McD's across the street where we could sit). The fries that came with Fried Chicken was cold and soggy (1 star) - we did not eat the fries, i brought them back with the ribs but did not care for refund, it was feedback for the kitchen. 

The response to dry ribs was, it was made \"Louisiana-style - which gives it more pull\". They wouldn't call or admit it was dry, I was OK with \"more pull\" but would not accept that the result was clearly dry.  

They did try to offer a store credit instead of  refund, but eventually returned cash after clearing it with manager. 

Factoring location, ambiance, and price - I give them 2 stars. 


Other Notables

I live downtown and decided to venture here with a pal. Getting here early evening is terrible due to traffic. But this wouldn't matter if the food lived up to hype. 

We parked at the McD's across the street. Walked into Stockyards and was hit with chaos. People standing around everywhere, it's hard to discern where a line starts. In fairness, it's a small place, and it was cold outside, so everyone was jammed in there like a night club. 

We met a couple at McD's that lived in area, they commented that they like the fried chick, but ribs were hit and miss."}
{"text":"Love this place!!
i am addicted to their pimento burger with crispy onions. Not overly spicy and the smoked jalapeno pepper mayo is very complimenting to the juicy grilled beef.The fries are delicious,perfectly crisp.The limeade washed everything down perfectly.
i did not feel heavy after polishing off their burger and fries 

Will definitely go back to try more on their menu"}
{"text":"The best burger in the city. Better than Burger's Priest. Better than Allen's. Need I say that I'll not be returning to the Hero burger type chains any time soon. 

I can't get enough of this burger. Juicy, tasty, and the fries are excellent. You get pounds of them too. Never think you'll finish. But you will! Oh will you ever!

Well done!"}
{"text":"I went to the Stockyards with my fiancé without any expectations. It's a small place, I would say the restaurant seats less than 20 people. We went there around 5:00 and it was empty but eventually filled up. You seat yourself and pay in the front sort of thing. 

Anyways, I ordered the fried chicken dinner and the beef brisket sandwich. I was really excited for the fried chicken but jeez, the chicken was cold...at first I was confused because I thought \" isn't fried chicken suppose to be hot?\". I knew the chicken was sitting out for a while and my fiancé agreed. Let this be known, I'm not the type of person to send back food but I had to tell the waitress that the chicken was cold and kindly asked if it was meant to be served cold. Obviously she said no and took the chicken. I was happy but then what really got me was the fact that all they did was re-fry the chicken...which shrivelled up and became over cooked. 

The beef brisket was okay, lots of mustard on the bun which I think over powered the beef brisket. 

We won't be eating here again, it was a mission for us to get there so we don't think it's worth the journey."}
{"text":"Burgers are great so is brisket ,chicken just passable
Very small place better to take out very crowded
Love the staff so friendly"}
{"text":"A quick update for my beloved Stockyards.

I came by late on a Sunday afternoon hoping to catch  a bit of brunch. Alas, the TTC had an issue and I stepped into the resto at 3:06 (they close at 3 and reopen at 5:30). They said that the griddles had just been switched off. However, they accommodated me by offering to still serve me up the pastrami sandwich. This made my very happy cuz (a) I travelled far to get here (b) I was hungry (c) I had always wanted to try their pastrami. 

They packed everything into a takeout box and gave me directions to a nearby park (talk about awesome service). As I unpacked my box, I was ecstatic to see the huge pile of meat!!! And needless to say, I love Stockyards fries.  My take on the sandwich: delicious, multi-flavorful [I can't even begin to describe all the different tastes], moist, and tender. All in all, a 9.5/10. My comparison with Caplansky's: close call. Very very very close. If I had to choose, I prefer the smokiness and dryness of Caplansky's. Stockyard's was a bit too moist and fell apart too easily (hello, some people will say WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? My defense: personal taste). And Zane's mustard is much better - has a tang to it. Rye bread is well .. rye bread. However, don't get me wrong, I still thoroughly enjoyed this meal."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and accommodating. 
I got the brisket sandwich and fries with a limeade. 
Everything was absolutely delicious. Maybe one too many caramelized onions on the sandwich, but that's my personal distaste for them. 
A whole combo & drink can be $20, but it's a $20 well spent. 
Kudos."}
{"text":"My very first time having Chicken & Waffles. I wasn't disappointed and I think I have set the bar for Chicken & Waffles going forward. The sauce and seasoning of the chicken made the dish. I ate most of the waffle first to prevent the waffle from being soggy from the sauce. Waffle was freshly made and soft, chicken was juicy with a deep fried just right. 

Even though the place is small and there was a line up when we got there, it only took less than 15 minutes for the two of us to get in. Staff was extremely welcoming and friendly despite being busy and having a full house constantly. 

Will definitely be coming back for their chicken & waffles!!! Their coffee was strong enough too! It was a great Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place produces spectacular food! Just thinking about it makes me drool. Buttermilk marinated fried chicken, it tasted even better than it sounds. They fry each order fresh, so the skin is nice and crispy while the meat is juicy. In addition to the chicken, I shared a pulled pork sandwich and a beef brisket sandwich. The pulled pork was good, but was dripping in overpowering bbq sauce, less sauce would've been perfect. Beef brisket sandwich topped with fried onions and cheese was well done! Cod chorizo fritters, very good. 

I tried their homemade limeade and their ginger iced tea, I prefer the limeade, it tastes like a virgin mojito. Limited seating at this joint so don't take a big group of friends with you. Have a seat at the counter and watch your food being prepared, nothing fancy but the cook will chit chat with you. I heard the ribs were good, but they only make it certain days of the week, so I missed out. Will certainly be back for a visit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible.  We shared both the Bat sandwich and the green chili burger.  Delicious!!! Highly recommend.  Can't wait to go back and try their fried chicken.  We sat at the counter and watched them make it - looks sooooo good."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself when you goto the Stockyards for the following:
a wait, things that run out on the menu, comfort southern cuisine and the guilty feeling of eating way too many carbs and calories!
This is a labour of love for owner Tom Davis who takes pride and works hard to provide Southern comfort food and good Carolina style BBQ alongside with traditional methods of smoking, dry curing and aging.

\We arrived around 12 and waited 45 minutes to be seated.  There is very limited seating here and usually is a take out joint during the week days.Once we were seated in front of the open kitchen and deep fryer which I was very happy with as I love witnessing food porn or in this case deep fry porn, we were informed by our bubbly server Lisa that 3 dishes had already sold out.  
The popular beignets were done by 10am, their smoked meat hash and their shirred eggs (oven baked eggs with smoked ladrons in a casserole dish); both of these latter dishes we watched and contemplated about ordering while we were in line and we felt like we missed these 2 dishes by a matter of minutes.  So we ordered fried chicken and waffles and the buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy.  The waffles were light and fluffy and OMG- the chicken was amazing!  We just went at the chicken with our hands and the batter was so decadently crunchy with their buttermilk batter, fried perfectly and it was drenched in a chili lime molasses sauce that we lapped up with our fingers afterward.  This gave us some street cred amongst the staff and we even found out that Tom is a thigh man- he likes the dark meat... good call!
The home made buttermilk biscuits were so good - you felt like they melted in your mouth and they were topped with the sausage gravy which was interesting as it was thick and a creamy grey colour.  It gave the bisquits a heavier texture and a bit of a punch. It was also served with runny scrambled eggs and home style potatoes.  While we ate, we watched them deep fry their chicken and french fries - which they go through about 150-200lb of french fries a day! WOW!"}
{"text":"Coming with pretty high expectations after reading all the Yelp reviews,  The Stockyards definitely did not disappoint. I tried the famous buttermilk fried chicken and boy, was it amazing. So crispy on the outside, and juicy and tender on the inside. Not to mention that the fries that comes with it are awesome. Wife had the brisket sandwich. The portion was huge, and the meat was so soft. Definitely worth the trip from Ajax :) We came around lunchtime and it was pretty packed but I think everyone was just finishing lunch because within 15 minutes it was empty. A little pricey but worth the money. Bill came to about 50 bucks, tax and tip included."}
{"text":"Had take out ribs, very good but had to wait 1/2 hour for the guy to cut and package even though they were cooked and sitting right in front of me.

A bit pricey for take out."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday evening to finally check this place out after hearing all the good reviews and seeing it on Triple D. 

Unfortunately, we got there relatively late in the evening due to work and the ribs had already been sold out.  So we decided to try the Butter Burger, the Fried Chicken Dinner and the Cider braised pork (on the recommendation of the waiter).  

The Butter Burger was actually featured on Triple D and it looked super juicy on television.  However, when we actually ate it....despite all the butter in it...we felt that the meat itself was a bit dry and in fact, the burger itself was almost...(shall I say) tasteless.  It definitely wasn't what we expected.  After taking a few bites, I had to  resort to putting some ketchup on it to give it some actual taste. 

The Fried Chicken Dinner came with an abundance of fries.  The chicken was probably the best thing I ate that night.  The meat was nice and juicy and there wasn't that much of a fried batter coating over the chicken but was still crispy on the outside.  The fries were ok...nothing to rave home about. 

The cider braised pork was ok.  I wouldn't say it was spectacular.  We liked the kale inside the sandwich and the garlic mayo.  In fact, our favourite thing about the sandwich was not the pork itself but all the sauce and toppings in the sandwich.  The pork itself was kind of dry....

I think my expectations for this place were too high.  It's been hyped up like crazy and I was expecting amazing food, but we left disappointed and felt the food was only OK.  Since we didn't get to try the ribs, we wouldn't mind coming back here to try it if we were in the neighbourhood...but we both felt it wasn't worth the trek to come down here to specifically eat here again."}
{"text":"The Stockyards definitely has one of the best burgers in Toronto.

I had a classic with bacon and cheese, plus fries and a bottled soft drink. The total was $17. Yes, you're gonna pay more than most places, but it's worth it if it's once in a blue moon.

The patty was juicy and fresh, the bacon was the best I've ever eaten on a burger, and it was topped with red onion and tomatoes. The shoestring fries were top notch.

The only con was the seat near the front door - a bit chilly at this time of year with so many customers coming and going, letting the cool air inside.

I went in the middle of the afternoon, thinking it would be a bit slower. I was surprised because it was very busy. I managed to snag a seat right away, but others behind me had to wait for others to finish and GTFO."}
{"text":"Love love love stockyards. I used to live in the area and go quite often. I'm not a fan of burgers and quite frankly will avoid eating them when I go out. I usually will not eat them at home either. When I went to Stockyards I tried a burger and I have now changed my opinion on burgers: I'll only eat burgers from this place. 

Everything is always fresh and mostly made in house. This is true comfort food. 

It is quite a busy spot and can be tough to find a place to eat but to me that's an indication that you're in for a great meal."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars.

After a friend has raved and raved about how delicious this BBQ joint is, I decided to visit. First impression was that it really does look like a classic BBQ joint with mainly bar seats. I warn you though, there isn't much arm room but dining here is so worth it.

I ordered the 'pulled pork sammy' with fries (which were thin, delicious, right amount of saltiness and way too big of a portion for one person!). The pulled pork sandwich was delicious, flavourful and they didn't cheap out on portions. Staff were nice there and really friendly as well, which is definitely a plus!

I'd definitely come back here to try the chicken and waffles but I believe they're only available on certain days. Oh yeah, not that it really matters but I ordered an orange pop and it came in an old school bottle and came with a cute tropicana-looking themed straw. ++"}
{"text":"It;s a sliver of  a restaurant good for take away or a quick bite.
The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is chill.
I had the fried chicken and it was good but nothing to rave about, the coleslaw is not my style too creamy and I couldn't wait to try the hot sauce but it's just like a generic cayenne pepper sauce.
It's good but not great."}
{"text":"This place has amazing BBQ. Not only is it authentic Southern BBQ, but it's also affordable. 

The only downside to this place is that depending on when you go, they might have run out of what you want. However, I use it as an excuse to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Decent burger but this puppy is fried so it is \"juicy\" or better described as greasy.  If you like that kind of thing than this is for you.  Sometimes a grilled burger can be too dry for sure.  Burger was good but once you add fries to the combo add cheese and bacon you are looking at almost $14.  Sorry,  no regular beef burger is worth that in my books.  Fries were too plentiful and over cooked .  They should be slightly golden not deep brown.   Service was good with a ultra perky caffeined up host with almost a \"soup Nazi\" attitude.  I am not sure I could tolerate her ego driven attitude for a stay in dinner.   Pretty much a whiner.  When asked about her onion rings she snapped that they were too good and we had to take them off the menu because they had upwards of 100 orders with only one fryer.  I did not dare tell her about Craft burger on King street who are usually as packed and they server a huge compliment of consistent fries and rings for far less coin ,  less greasy too.  She went on about just 20 seats,  but Craft Burger  has less and they do not come up with excuses.
Maybe the clientele at Bathurst and St Clair are just a bit high strung because she remarked that they can get pretty testy if they can't get what they want and when things get backed in the kitchen the clients tend to be vocal.  
I did not try their smoked stuff but suspect it is decent as well.  Yuppies will pay anything to be cool and not have to cook.  In all decent but pricey for just a simple burger.  I also think Phils on College has better fries albeit frozen and chunkier."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had the pull pork sandwich and my husband had the beef brisket. Both were good and greasy. The side of french fries was huge. Service was a slow and disorganized. Overall good experience, but be ready to wait"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had a bad experience, although I rarely eat-in because my apartment is near enough to walk the food home and for it to still be hot when I get there. 

Staff have always been super friendly and welcoming and informative.

I usually go for the fried chicken. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and flavourful. 

Other favourites:
Cider Braised Pork - I think this is a newer addition to the menu this season (don't remember it from the summer) but it was fantastic. I melted a little bit the first time I had it.

Ribs - Although I don't tend to use much of the homemade sauce - a bit too vinegary for my taste, but dry they are still pretty frickin' awesome.

Brussel Sprouts - a \"Green of the Day\" special, I only got to experience them once, but it forever changed my ideas about brussel sprouts. 

As far as price goes, it may be a bit more expensive than I would usually like to spend, but I think it's totally worth it on occasion. I always end up getting multiple meals out of my order - and it works pretty well to store it in the fridge and reheat it in the oven later!"}
{"text":"I think stockyards has the best burger in the city. I love their fries but try to stick with the vege of the day, it's the healthier option. I like to get the biscuit on the way out too."}
{"text":"Went to Stockyards for dinner, and it was fantastic. It's a small space, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit, but well worth it. Sat at the bar and had the fried chicken dinner and pulled brisket sandwich. Both delicious. The sandwich came with fries (which were extra crispy , my #1 requirement for good fries) so was able to easily sub the fries that came with the fried chicken for any other side. That evening they had a small batch of roasted brussel sprouts in pancetta, which was of particular note in the meal because it provided some bitterness to balance out the sweet beef marinade and salty fries. Ask for their homemade hot sauce, which goes with everything. The pulled beef had a good amount of vinegar in it, which elevated the taste from the run-of-the-mill sticky sweet pulled meat sandwiches at chain restaurants (think Jack Astors and Milestones); the coleslaw was equally well vinegar'ed and not at all overloaded with mayo. There's no LLBO license, so unfortunately no alcohol, but you'll be too busy eating to worry about drinking. It was nice watching the cooks make everything to order. Well worth the trip to the St. Clair area if you're a more \"downtown-centric\" individual, and would certainly return."}
{"text":"The Stockyards helps me to embrace all of the virtues of my impending obesity."}
{"text":"Best beef brisket sandwich ever. Love the cool atmosphere and the service is friendly too. Been here a bunch of times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to The Stockyards on several occasions and it's always packed! We usually get take out or have a picnic at the nearby Wychwood Barns. (Side note:  My first visit there Steven Page formerly of the band Barenaked Ladies was in line in front of me waiting for his food! This place is well-known). 

DINNER: 
As most people have already mentioned the fried chicken is amazing and it is definitely my favourite menu item. I can only eat half and usually share with my husband. The chicken is moist inside and the batter is tasty and flavourful. The fries are excellent too. The coleslaw is decent but not my favourite.


The burgers are also pretty good. I had the Animal Burger (recently taken off the menu) which had too much sauce on it for my liking. The burger patty itself though is tasty.

Most people rave about the ribs but I thought they were just okay. A little boring for my liking and the fried chicken is much tastier in my opinion.

On my last visit I tried the Cuban sandwich and I am so glad I did. The sandwich was amazing! So flavourful and I especially liked the picked onions. I can't wait to go back to try it again!

The homemade limeade is also good to wash the food down!

BRUNCH

The fried chicken and waffles for brunch are very good. The only thing I didn't like was the sauce- which was a chili maple molasses glaze. It just didn't work for me on the waffles and I think I would have preferred regular maple syrup. I just eat the chicken and waffles without the sauce.


I've also tried the BAT (Bacon Sandwich with fried green tomatoes) which was good but not awesome. The bread needed to be toasted more or something. The sandwich was a bit soggy.

You have to try the biscuits- they are always served warm and are delicious!


Despite it getting a little busy and hectic sometimes the staff are always super friendly, patient and very competent. They run a good business."}
{"text":"My meal was good, but nothing to write home about. I had the pulled pork with the coleslaw, which was way to vinegary for my taste. I tasted my partner's fried chicken, and that had no flavour in it except for the breading. The fries were good though. I'm interested in trying the burger - but for take out, not dining in.

Some people may find the tight space a turn-off. I was kind of bothered by it, as the only choices for seating are pretty much by the cooking area, in front of a mirror, and facing the window. We sat by the cooking area, and since we didn't stay for too long, I dealt with it.

Our waitress was extremely rude. She was a blond middle aged lady with short hair. I get that she's busy but wow! Her rudeness is more than enough to make me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Went there for fried chicken, by the time we got a seat (40+ minutes) they were out of it. I though ah great all this waiting and they dont even have what I wanted, asked one of the cooks what I should order, he got me a spicy pepper burger of some sort. Insane, super simple very few toppings but totally awesome. Cool atmosphere, will be back!"}
{"text":"It took a few circling around the block for us to find the place, but am glad that we did.  Busy as heck, and run by a young group of staff hustling and bustling.  But they were all very professional and offered fantastic service.  Koodles to see young staff so disciplined.

Food wise, well.. this isn't something that you should eat all the time.  But this establishment will definitely become of my guilty pleasure places.  The fried chicken was quite good; the french fries were orgasmic!  I wish they sold beer though.. I always like a nice cold glass of pilsner type of beer when consuming greasy food.  My friends had the sandwiches (pulled pork, BLT, etc), which I sampled and were equally tasty.

At $13 or $14 (can't remember now) is not cheap.. but then again it was a lot of food.  Half chicken, a mountain of fries and coleslaw.  I think you would pay almost as much at KFC for a 4 piece dinner, no?  Well maybe not quite.  How about Swiss Chalet?  Come on.. it's not that bad.  Make the trip, you will thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is good. Make the trek from Leslieville for brunch kind of good. 

I've been four times now, and always find it difficult not to order the stockyard, it's just that good. Love the fries too. 

Looking forward to trying lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stockyards has the best damn fried chicken period.  The chicken was perfectly juicy with the skin so crisp that you can hear the crunch a mile away.  Somehow they know that this beautiful chicken goes well with the amazing spicy sauce that comes on the side.  The cole slaw was perfectly balanced and the fries delicious. The service was great and everyone was very accommodating. They make up for in customer service what they don't have in space.  You had at me at Fried Chicken......"}
{"text":"Good Lawds! The brunch here is amazing!

Decided to join my friends for lunch after already having a huge breakfast.  I didn't think I can eat much but ordered the Chicken w/ waffles anyways.  When my dish came, I thought to myself \"no way I can finish this!\" .  Boy was I wrong.  After one bite of the perfectly prepared waffle topped with sweet and spicy garlic sauce, I couldn't stop myself.  I left two waffle on the side and finally tried the deep fried crispy chicken also topped with ssg sauce.  The flavor and texture was perfect.  I was in brunch heaven.  It was so good, I could've finished another order easily.

Beware of the operational hours though.  The boss of this place is very keen on rejecting customers that walks in after their brunch hours.

If you're looking to eat inside the restaurant, be prepared to wait forever.  This place is small and only has bar stools.  It's a horrible place if you're trying to get seats for more than 2 people.

Go during the weekend and you can park on the side streets for free.

Can't wait to go back for more fried chicken yo! 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trek, this place has great food! Super busy, and somewhat small, so don't expect a table during the dinner rush, at least not without a wait. 

We ordered buttermilk fried chicken for takeout, and were not at all disappointed! Not only is the batter perfectly crisp, but it has so much flavour with a bit of heat, unlike most fried foods where you only taste the grease. The chicken comes with a side of fries, and hot sauce; a large portion for the price, we were actually eating leftovers for the rest of the weekend. Who doesn't love fried chicken leftovers after a night of drinking?!"}
{"text":"Phew! Finally got in with the \"IN\" crowd and got myself a meal at the Stockyards! I am glad I went here before deciding again to maybe go back on the vegetarian route...

We got there at about 5:30 since we had nothing else to do, and figured we would try to grab an early dinner and avoid the crowd, thinking that was early enough. Packed! The crowd is a little deceiving since a majority is a result of their mountain of take-out orders, but regardless, the seating is very limited here (less than 20 at a time). Luckily, we were second on the dine-in list and got seated pretty fast. The hostess/waitress was super cool.

Amazingly exciting thing of the day: their special of the day was BRUSSEL SPROUTS. And boy, were they tasty - highlight of my meal (cue the laughs and eye-rolling from carnivores)! So between two girls, we ordered the brussel, the fried chicken and a half-rack of ribs. Needless to say, we were STUFFED.... FOR TWO NIGHTS. Not only the portions monsterous, the leftovers were also monsterous for dinner the second night. I'm probably not the best person to judge fried chicken as it is something I never order (outside of my toonie tuesday at KFC/Popeyes days which are long past), but I personally found two of my four chicken pieces were VERY DRY.... bad luck? I enjoyed the ribs a lot though. We were lucky to get seats with an excellent view of the kitchen and that was fun to watch as well. They are an efficient bunch over there! Also, their iced tea with ginger - refreshingly yum! 

Overall, great experience - felt like an exciting field trip in elementary school. But, I probably won't be going back anytime soon, because I am just more of a herbivore. If you are a true carnivore, you should go here and drool your face off.

And lastly, can I just say I love the St. Clair W area! I wish it was closer to me.

{"text":"Friendly service, good food, portions appropriate for the price.  Had the chicken & waffles and biscuits & gravy.  The syrup was sort of strange and the sausage chunks in the gravy were a bit too substantial.  Definitely good soul food, but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Yes yes YES. Hands down the best fried chicken in the city. This place has it all; Amazing food, friendly staff and good prices. My friends and i came here and waited 15 minutes for an opening. If you are more than 3 people i would suggest taking out and eating in the park.
I ordered the 4 piece dinner and i couldn't finish it. The chicken was delicious to say the least. My friends got the chicken and waffles which looked amazing. 
My only issue is that their location is out of the way. But with one bite of the chicken i forget where i am. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go unclog my arteries."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles but you'll have to go during lunch/brunch if you're going for that. Nice syrup kick. Crispy juicy chicken.

Casual place where you eat on stools."}
{"text":"The BAT: Bacon, Arugula, and Fried Green Tomato Sandwich is the, wait for it, BEST sandwich I have eaten in Toronto. Period. 

The combination of the thick slabs of juicy and fatty house cured bacon, with the peppery Arugula, tart Green Tomato, and epic Lemon Aioli is truly unreal. GET IT!

The Fried Chicken is totally deserving of the title of Toronto's Best Fried Chicken.  It has a delectably thin but crispy exterior, and a juicy interior that lends itself to the 48 hour brining process they put their birds through. A couple of the pieces were white meat, and they were just gushing with juice. NOM!

Oh, and the guy working the flat top and fryer was wearing a Sons of Anarchy shirt, which made the experience even more awesome!!! I am sure the dudes of Samcro would have an awesome time eating here :D"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed that with their \"new\" menu (all the new items on the menu were previously specials that have been rotating), almost everything sans burgers have gone up in prices by $0.50 to $1. With that being said, I would still come back regularly because their food is so good! Unfortunately, this may not be good news for my health because let's be honest, you don't come here for healthy food.

After trying everything on the menu, I cannot decide what is my favourite dish from here, but if there is one thing you absolutely need to try, it would be the fried chicken combo. It comes with half a chicken, a whole lotta fries and a coleslaw. I'm not a huge fan of the coleslaw since I despise celery, but the chicken and fries are awesome. I'm usually don't like white meat because I can't stand eating chicken breasts that are too dry, but they manage to make their fried chicken both crispy on the outside and moist all around the inside. Their ribs and smoked chicken are also iconic. They're only served on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays, but don't count on being able to get them on Sunday unless you wait right when they open for dinner. 

Their Porchetta Sandwich and Burgers are great too. The latter includes an homage to west-coast U.S. burger chain In-N-Out, called the Animal Style Burger - which contains two small patties, cheese, caramelized onions, and a spread similar to thousand island dressing.

Sunday Brunch is a completely different beast that's worth more visits; their oh-so-buttery biscuits are to die for. I would recommend the fried chicken & waffles combo, Eggs Tommy (variation of an eggs benedict, but with a biscuit, deep fried(!) poached eggs, butter-poached shrimp, andouille sausage instead), or the shirred eggs.

Again, all the food here is delightful. But be warned that the hours following the meal will be very unproductive!"}
{"text":"Been here once.

3 stars was the average of the two items I had : 1) ribs 2) beef brisket sandwich.

1) ribs = 5 stars 
Awesome!

2) beef brisket =1 star 
Sandwich was messy - too much sauce, couldn't taste the beef.
I took it to go, it's packaged in a box, thus not tightly contained.
The sauce came out of the sandwich, which then got all over the outside of the bread making it a sloppy mess to try and eat (some may like this!)
Didn't finish it.

Service was very good.
Restaurant itself has a nice vibe and decor."}
{"text":"Went with friends on Sunday afternoon. We had to wait for about 30 minutes but in the end it was worth it.

The food is amazing and excellent portions and very tasty. No one in our group had anything negative to say about their food. The fried chicken was excellent and the made in house waffles are amazing.

When I go back to Toronto, definitely going here for a meal."}
{"text":"I've been a few times, and have had the beef brisket, the biscuits and gravy (at breakfast time), the pulled pork, and the fried chicken (of course).  Everything is amazing.  My dining companion and I decided that if we were chickens, ending up in a basket at Stockyards would be the preferred way to leave this mortal coil.  Portions are also VERY large, so arrive hungry!

For soft drinks they make their own lemonade (seasonally), and iced teas (with ginger, etc), and have some old-fashioned style soda pops as well.

Service is efficient and friendly, and  the vibe is cool and unpretentious.  Everyone there seems like a regular.  

I must admit, I perhaps don't have the right to review them, because I haven't had their ribs (only available on select days, and from what I understand they sell out double-quick)."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was really good! We got the chicken dinner which wasn't bad at all. You get alot for what your paying. Definitely beats going to popeyes or KFC. The only downfall to this place was limited seating and that the seating we did get was a bar styled counter. So we were eating while watching the cooks make the food. I would come back here for take out. I probably wouldn't come back to sit down and eat"}
{"text":"I have a lot of wicked things to say about this resto.  I dont even know where to start...HAHA.  I'll continue later but I thought I'd include my schpiel on the Rings since it's on the list first!


**Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS segway**

I'm going to start off by saying this place NO LONGER serves their fantastic onion rings that get stacked like a chimney on a plate for you.
Usually when onion rings are beer battered or look like Harvey's rings, I totally expect for the same hum drum taste. And to be honest, my initial impression was just that at first glance but gosh darnit I was wrong!  The batter is a bit more crispy and they put a little bit of spice in it to give it some distinctiveness. The thickness is not that significant but the texture and taste make up for it.

Again, let me reiterate that they DON'T SERVE THEM anymore.  A whole star is taken off a possible 5 star place because of that! grrr. 

Demand that they put it back on the menu!

**Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS end**"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this joint for months now but I'm never in this part of the city. I finally had an opportunity to check it out last night and was happy that we could get a seat since I've heard about the lineups. First thing you notice when you walk in is the smell of smoky barbecue. It envelopes you like your favourite blanket. I tried to get the brisket sandwich but they were sold out so I had the porchetta with rapini sandwich instead. The porchetta is amazing, snuggled with cracklings and belly. The baguette it rides on is crispy but moist enough that it doesn't slice your mouth open. Also ordered a side of asparagus with blue cheese. This was very tasty, though too greasy and the cheese was too overpowering with the delicate flavours of the porchetta. I should have skipped the fries, which added even more grease to my meal, and gone with a potato salad and cole slaw instead. My Lady had a pulled chicken sandwich, which was moist and tender, but not as good as the porchetta. Stockyards does not serve alcohol, which was a shame, but it kept the bill down.

They only do ribs and smoked chicken on certain nights, so call ahead if this is what you're looking for. I'm definitely coming back to try the ribs."}
{"text":"I could eat 67% of the menu - not that it isn't all good just some stuff if I am going out to eat I want you to do it otherwise, I'll buy fancy ingredients, pass on the left and do it myself. I will co-sign other reviewers with the fried chicken and I adore waffles. 

Took an out of town friend here as I was living in the area and we both left super satiated. Which you want from a resto. 

Worth going, maybe even being a regular. High fives."}
{"text":"Had the pulled chicken sandwich with fries and an ice cole Limeade. Was delicious. Was talking to the owner who said it was the weakest sandwich on their menu. If that was the weakest link, I can't wait to try the rest! It's nice to see people who are passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch on Sunday and was not disappointed! For all those reviews that tell you this is the best chicken and waffles in Toronto they are right. 

The four piece filled me up for the rest of the day and more than made up for the trek up the hill from Bloor St.

Restaurant is small but the turnover is quick and food was well worth the half hour wait.

Service was also excellent and they even gave us a couple of biscuits to go home with. 

We'll be back this weekend for more!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the best burger in town. My only complaint is I wish they had more seating inside. I like to eat a burger like that right off the grill and its so packed there sometimes you have to wait outside while they make your order."}
{"text":"I have to say I am a little underwhelmed.  The SO and I ordered the fried chicken dinner with sides and a sandwich. The location is terrible, but we happened to be passing by. The decor is fitting, very farmhouse-industrial. I have to say I am not a huge meat eater, and not really a fan of heavy, greasy food or white bread. What I was expecting was some down home goodness and some flavour. Everything was a little bland. The coleslaw and the gravy especially. 

All in all it was ok. Not the freakout fabfest I expected after hearing all the hype here. Everything needed something. Salt maybe? The buffalo sauce was indeed delicious. If you are in the hood give them a shot, but i wouldn't bother making your way across town."}
{"text":"I came here for the Sunday brunch menu at around 9AM and we were seated immediately. Apparently the wait time is a lot longer if you come around 10-11AM. Best Fried Chicken I've had so far, it's so crunchy and so delicious! The beignets are also very good, I forget what was inside, caramel? Dulce de Lèche? Ah who cares, it was delicious, even at 9AM!"}
{"text":"Tiny restaurant but excellent if you like chicken and waffles. The line goes by quickly but come early of you want to be sat right away.  This place is worth a visit though I personally don't like having bones in my chicken and waffles. Service is pretty fast, but this place is definitely not good for groups."}
{"text":"OK but not amazing. Chicken was very good. Ribs were dry. Place has no alcohol so had to be a take out!"}
{"text":"Oh, Christine C., I feel your pain! We made special plans to specifically make it to Stockyards on a Sunday so we could get our greedy carnivorous hands on some famous ribs (\"after 5pm\" only!). We were there at 6:30pm. They were completely sold out. According to our bubbly (albeit professional) server, they always sell out pretty much right away. So anyone out there planning to snag ribs on a rib day - Tuesday, Friday, or Sunday - get there at 5pm or you'll leave disappointed.

Other notes - best to get your meal to go. Unless you're going in a party of two, it is near impossible to snag a seat for more than three people at a time. Our party of four had a hard time finding a seat and ended up settling for a makeshift communal table around the waiting area bench at the front. It all worked out though! We pulled up a couple of tree stump footstools and did it camping styles.

All you need to know is that everything - yes, everything - is amazing. Order whatever you want. It'll be great. Fries come with hot sauce and ketchup. We all shared a 2L pitcher of iced tea with a tang of ginger (I think) for a mere $8. Biscuits were badass. Pulled-anything is tender and juicy. The fried chicken is, as my comrade said, \"quite possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had. Ever.\" 

The flow of customers coming in to pick-up their orders was constant and service was already friendly. Thank goodness I don't live any closer or I'd be one of the vulnerable many being seduced into this teensy smoky joint."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!

Biggest side of fries! Too bad: no sweet potato fries, but the burger is too good to really care."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in TO. Stockyards, please make more locations in the city!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I came here for one thing only, the fried chicken which I had heard so much.  I've had it book marked for the longest time. Yesterday I was finally able to make it to the St. Clair to pay a visit.

Now this ain't no fancy cuisine. You're given a fork, a stainless steel bowl  ( for bones ) and wet naps. This kind of food is downright pedestrian. Roll up your sleeves and get your m'fing hands dirty!!  :D

Atmosphere: Decoration sparse. The server was friendly, the music loud - you practically have to shout when communicating to the person next to you. Come to think of it's very much like a bar atmosphere, but you got a grill-tender behind the counter instead of a bartender. lol :)

Seating arrangements are communal. Wood counters along edges with bar stool seating is the only option here.


Now for the meal:

It took twenty minutes for my fried chicken, fries, coleslaw order to arrive ( $14 ). 

It was presented in a huge but comically iron pan :) The platter looked ridiculously large for just one person to eat!   Bring your appetites folks because you get a lot for your money. It looked pretty good though. 

After sizing up the chicken platter I developed my plan of attack - first started by putting aside the coleslaw, ate through mountain of fries to uncovered buried 4 pieces of fried chicken treasure. 

I grabbed  my first piece ( a leg ) and chomped down, the meat was juicy with tons of hot oil escaping and scorching the roof of my mouth. However.. but the spices were not strong enough to distinguish it was rather bland tasting. 

The other side items; coleslaw was finely shredded  and it was not your typical regular Starfrit shred but a gourmet kind,  and the shoe string fries were one of the the best I've had.


So what's to take away - 

Anything fried tastes good.  That's a given. 

Stockyards highly talked about fried chicken was good but wasn't amazing great. Lacked any notable spice flavor.

They offer excellent side orders of coleslaw and shoe string potato french fries I tried."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken, best I ever had, even after going on a road trip in the southern states last summer where you would think you'd get even better. The ribs are a bit dry to my taste and taste too much like bacon  (some might rejoice at that idea). Though I adoooore their buttermilk biscuit, I literally could only enjoy those twice as they always seem to be out of stock (and I ask for them every time I visit! Please have more on hand!)

I like the food overall, love the service, and would recommend going when you feel like you need a junk food fix. (Nothing healthy there!)"}
{"text":"What a dump.  Place is closed at 6:00 and no hours are posted.  Retail geniuses!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is great - I've tried most items on the menu.
It's not spacious but that's the charm of the place.  Best fried chicken chicken."}
{"text":"After reading all these reviews, I felt like I had to chime in because to those who give this place a negative rating are obviously idiots. Reading their reviews made no sense whatsoever. Here are some highlights:

\"The ambience was crap and the wind was blowing every time someone opened the door\"
\"Fried chicken was 3 stars, but is not tastier than Popeyes\"
\"I live downtown and decided to venture here with a pal. Getting here early evening is terrible due to traffic.\"
\"It was finally our turn and as I ordered take out the door kept on opening and cold wind was blowing it.\"
\"The breakfast burger was good, but the flavour was bland\"

All I can say to these pompous buffoons is go crawl back under your bridge. K? Thx.
 
Stockyards is one of my favourite places in all of GTA. I have yet to find anyone who doesn't like their fried chicken. I've travelled to the USA and have tried fried chicken from the southern states, and I can say Stockyard's chicken rivals theirs.

Last time I came here was about a week ago when my wife and I wanted a snack. So we ordered one burger to share, some greens and fries. The point of this review isn't to explain how amazing the food is (because it is) but also, despite having a greasy spoon/dive like atmosphere, this restaurant is operated professionally. 

First thing was, since it was near closing, I notice the staff start cleaning one of their fridges - outside and inside. If you're thinking: \"What is the big deal?\", I can tell you, not many restaurants out there will do this, at least not on a daily basis. Seeing this type of thing shows that the restaurant prides themselves on their food as well as the cleanliness. This scores high marks in my book.

Next thing that happened was my half of the burger that my wife and I shared had a hair on  it. I brought it to the staff's attention and they were apologetic about the situation. They took it back and made me a new one, no questions asked. But not only that, I found out later they comp'ed the burger for me. Again, if you're thinking: \"What's the big deal?\". I have been to places that will only cook you half the burger since my wife ate the other half or charge you half/full price anyway. I think I've grown accustomed to this type of behaviour from restaurants so when Stockyards \"did the right thing\", it really put a smile on my face."}
{"text":"I live near the Stockyards - so when I heard it was opening I was apprehensive - hoping that we get a winner in the humewood area. Well as all the reviews have posted. We have. Now every time i get a chance to go, i get giddy. 
There is one problem with the Stockyards - their fried chicken is DO DAMN F'ING GOOD that its so hard to go in and NOT order it. The rare occasion that i am either chickend out, or i can pry my taste buds away from the deep fried goodness, their ribs are amazing, their BBQ brisket sammy is intoxicating. and the pulled pork is gooey gooey goodness. And then, on the incredibly exciting rare occasion - akin to finding $100 bill on the ground - is the when they have their pastrami. I think big-foot has been spotted more times than the pastrami. WOW talk about the best sandwich ever. 
Now if they could only get more seating inside - the sidewalk is comfortable, but kinda cold in the winter;)"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time was quite a while back but I had their fried chicken dinner and it was phenomenal!!!! Must try if you haven't yet. My dinning companion at the time had a burger, it was a solid, big burger. But of course the fried chicken was better. 

Yesterday I finally went to the Stockyards again so I can try their ribs. Some bits were dry and chewy, but overall good value for what you pay for ($15 for half rack, $30 for one rack). My dinning companion had the pulled pork sandwich. I tried a bit, it was veryyyy good. 

Bottom line: fried chicken is a must get."}
{"text":"The place has a very friendly feel and there are very few people who work there. I ordered the Fried Chicken Dinner. The chicken here is much better than any other fried chicken place, not only is it crispy, the flavor and freshness is noticeable. The chicken has a great classic southern buttermilk fried chicken flavor. Don't expect to have a clean plate by the end; the fries are extra crispy, and there are a lot of small pieces (not great for eating with your hands). Also, the crispness of the skin and seasoning makes the skin crumble away with each bite, which is typical of any true fried chicken. Downsides: Coleslaw is very small, not very cold, and plain. Seating is very limited, and the place itself is very small. Fries aren't the greatest. Make sure to ask for extra ketchup and hot sauce because it will be needed. Didn't get to try the ribs or buttermilk biscuits but they both looked and smelled amazing! The kitchen/grill is right out in the open so hygiene can be easily monitored which is great. Overall I am satisfied with the quality but for $17 after taxes it is a little overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Top quality. Delicious. Worth the wait.
I had a smoked trout sandwich once that was amazing.
The shoestring fries are excellent.
The best friend chicken."}
{"text":"My wife and I drove all the way across the city to try this place out, what a major disappointment. We didn't mind the wait as it was busy, but to see 3 other tables get their order before us was horrible. The fried chicken was awesome(2 stars worth), I ordered the brisket and got the pulled pork. I didn't care by that point as we were to hungry to complain, plus they didn't care about getting our food to us in the first place why would they cared if I complained. When paying I could have easily walked out as no one was manning the cash, I didn't but they also didn't get a tip. Thank you Stockyards for ruining the celebration dinner that we wanted to have at your place. If you like good food and horrible service then this is your place."}
{"text":"What a wonderful, wonderful establishment!  The fried chicken & waffles is a must have, and the energy in the restaurant is exhilarating, warm and welcoming.  A definite Toronto fave now!"}
{"text":"Good burger.  I had the classic burger and fries... Amazing atmosphere, would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always hits the spot if you're looking for fried chicken and grease. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's  not as great as I thought it would be. 
The chicken and waffle was delicious. But if you eat them separately they can both be done better. The chicken didn't have that much flaviour and the waffle wasn't fluffy enough. 
The breakfast burger was good, but the flavour was bland. I got sick of it after 3 bites. 
The people who work there are slow and confused. They spend more time talking to eachother than the customers. If they would figure out how to run the place maybe they wouldn't have people waiting for 20 mins when there was 3 tables available. 
Probably wouldn't make a special trip just to come back here. If I was in the area I will drop by though for some greasy food."}
{"text":"A very pleasant, quick, tasty (albeit unhealthy) breakfast of biscuits and sausage gravy.  Nice way to start a weekend...and it opens at 9am (Toronto Bonus)."}
{"text":"Initially we gave three stars.  Ever since then we've gone back three times and have enjoyed it more.  It's much better sitting there when its not too hot and you can order takeout and go to the McDonald's across the street for more comfortable seating.  We always get the fried chicken dinner and a sandwich.  Highly recommended when you're in the mood for barbecue."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever!! Sucks that they have not much seating, but other than that it's friggin amazing. Literally the best bacon on the planet, and the staff is so super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is finger lickin' good! Move over KFC - your time is up! 
 'nuff said."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait..

Best Fried Chicken and Waffles in town! They are a must try if your new to stockyards. The only down side stockyards is the seating, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich and my boyfriend had the 4pc fried chicken meal. It was one of the best fried chicken I have ever had. The pulled pork was perfection. 

The fries were a little soggy but we got the meal to go so maybe they weren't as fresh when we got home. 

All in all a great meal!"}
{"text":"I would give the Stockyards a 5 stars for the food and a 3 stars for the restaurant. 

The food:

Amazing. The flavours are good and they have a very no-nonsense way of just grilling or frying meat. It's fantastic. I went for brunch and had the deep fried \"poached\" eggs meal. The bread was soft and delicious. You can ask for jam to put on it. My friend had the waffles and chicken. The buffalo sauce they drizzle on top is a bit spicy so if you are unsure how much you can handle, best order it on the side and apply it yourself. 

The restaurant:

Uncomfortable. The seating is extremely cramped and small. They have mirrors up on the side to make the space look bigger but it just feels awkward looking at yourself while you eat. The place is very hot because of the broilers in the middle so it feels like a furnace in the middle of summer. 

Verdict:
Skip the line, call and order takeout instead. The food is great but best enjoyed elsewhere."}
{"text":"they have no toppings on the burger and the bun is soft and thin (slimy from the grease).

The patty itself is good and chunky. 
Coleslaw was terrible - we threw it out. 

Fries were ok. Below average."}
{"text":"So happy to find this place.
And I was surprised that it was still a lot of people dining even though we got there about 30 mins before they will close. 
Anyway, I had Fried Chicken Dinner with homemade Iced tea and wow...it was super moist and flavourful. I even liked the homemade iced tea which includes a hint of honey and ginger. It was pretty good too. 
My husband ordered coke and it came with bottle, not a can.  

I only disappointed that fried chicken with waffle offers until 3pm. 
So I will definitely come back to try this next time. 

Highly recommended for very casual date night."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and went along based on recommendation of our local host who is a chef. Definitely happy with her recommendation and would now be happy to recommend in turn. It was very busy at 7 pm in a Sunday night - a good sign. We were happy to be seated at a counter rather than a table so were able to be seated before others. Good came quite quickly. 
Shared a beast burger, fries and brisket sandwich with my boyfriend. Food was yummy, meat was succulent, great flavour and we left stuffed and satisfied. I preferred the burger as the sauce on the brisket was quite vinegary. I gave the remainder of my half of the sandwich to my bf and he said his half was much better as sauce hadn't such a strong flavour. Maybe not mixed fully. ?Thankfully we had a bit of a walk back to the place we were staying to work it all off!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I have yet to be disappointed. I will review the dishes I've tried so far to give a sense of their offering.

The fried chicken is perfect. Crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. The accompanying french fries are good but a bit too thin for my tastes. They definitely don't travel too well as a result.

The ribs are heaven. The meat falls off the bone and the rub they use is perfect. 

I tried the burger the last time I went and it was incredible. Tasted like an upscale version of a big Mac. Delicious sauce but with higher quality ingredients. 

The brisket sandwich has everything you would ever want in a good meat sandwich. Flaky brisket with a great dipping sauce for dipping on an excellent bun.

The only real criticism I can levy is directed towards their coleslaw. In short, it sucks and I don't really get how it can be on the menu with all these other delicious items. 

Otherwise, this place is heaven and I recommend you go - now."}
{"text":"Caveat lector: This review reflects the experience at The Stockyards at brunch. It will be updated once I've also been there for dinner.

The Stockyards has a much larger presence in my head than it does on the street, perhaps because it has been so positively reviewed by friends and acquaintances. I'll confess to being a fan of all things BBQ related, but perhaps to being a bigger fan of brunch, so the notion of combining both at the Stockyards was positive at best.

It's worth arriving early since the place is tiny, and you will want to stay for the bustling, efficient personable service. They are attentive without being overbearing and the little bit of attitude is actually quite fun. Brunch offerings range from the traditional (fried chicken & waffles - succulent moist chicken w/ perfectly crispy skin over tender waffles) and classic (buttery biscuits with creamy sausage gravy and heavenly scrambled eggs) to the novel (poached eggs on chorizo over corn cakes w/ shrimp & devilled hollandaise). Chances are you'll find something to wake those sleepy taste buds.

Why they didn't get 5 stars:
1. The portions are entirely too large for a single person at brunch, especially if you are planning on eating another meal that day.
2. I found the hollandaise too runny for my liking, though well seasoned.
3. The waffles could have been much crisper (perhaps switch to a yeast based one?)
4. For a place that does amazing BBQ it doesn't feature much on the brunch menu (A brisket benedict would win my heart in a matter of moments)."}
{"text":"Pretty decent fried chicken with copious portions. The seating space is very limited though and I think its more of a take out. Make sure you're famished before attempting to eat an entire serving here though. I always need to share with someone"}
{"text":"It's very rare that I'll write such a short review, but with 28 voices already singing the praises of The Stockyards in near-unison there's no point in saying much, and god knows I won't be saying anything new.  

When I say near-unison, I mean it.  Not that I'm writing a meta-review here, but a quick scan of the ratings shows only three 3-star reviews.  Everyone else has this joint at four or five stars, for one good reason or another.

Here's my good reason:  fried chicken.  I'm not a fried chicken junkie by any means, and only ordered it on Shari \"Karaoke Queen\" M.'s pressing.  But it blew my mind.

Also on the hit list for me was the limeade; fresh made and packed with mint, it was a tremendously refreshing and original bevvie that set off against the fried chicken beautifully.  

An honourable mention goes to the onion rings.  I'm still on the hunt for the perfect onion ring, but these come close.  No snails here - the light batter stays on the onion so you're not faced with the painful dilamma of either eating your onions and rings separately or picking up a knife and fork and looking like a knob.

Go.  Try it."}
{"text":"Everything here that I have tried is delicious and that is a shameful amount of food. I've had the chicken and waffles, the burger (also the burger seared with mustard, yum!), the brisket and the bat. The only thing I wasn't overly keen on was the slaw as a side, it was overly peppery. Limited seating but you can phone your order in ahead of arriving."}
{"text":"I really give this place a 1.5/5.

I've been here 4 times, each time because one of my friends has wanted to try this overrated place. Food is expensive, and is no where near the quality you'd expect. The first time I went I tried the brisket and it was so dry and bland. Second time I tried The Beast Style burger which is pretty much animal/jargz style. It was so small, and  salty. All I could think of while eating it was \"Wow, I paid 14 dollars for this.\" And I left disappointed again. After seeing the Fried chicken recipe in the star, I was tempted to go back just to try it. It sounded amazing in the article so I thought \"Screw it, third time's the charm.\" I tried the fried chicken which looked delicious, but was nothing special.  No where as good as it sounded. There are a lot better fried chicken joints out there. So then the last time...A friend wanted to try the place out, and convinced me to come back a fourth time. This was the food was alright. I tried their Hanger Steak sandwich is was pretty decent, but the waitress kept trying to push me to leave as it was busy. Really lady? Good way to treat your customers. 4/4. All bad in one way or another. I'll definitely avoid it from now on, I gave it enough chances."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when I come here and it's NOT ribs night, because I can't bring myself to miss the ribs. It's like, what if I miss the ribs?! But it's ribs night three times a week.

Anyway. Anyway. The BBQ sauce is great. The ribs are great. The pulled pork sandwich is great. The brisket sandwich is AOK.

They make the best burgers I have ever had in my entire life.

The best burgers. I dream about them. I feel embarrassed ordering them because I like them so much. I've never had burgers this good. Sometimes the cheese melts onto the grill. Oh man. I was just there, and I already want to go back.

If Canada ever brings back the death penalty, I know where I'm getting my last meal."}

1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent

Food: 5

Overall: 4

Extra information:

* Brunch on Sat & Sun
* Closed Mondays
* Ribs only on Tues, Fri and Sun at 5PM


Please don't ask me why it took me 2 years to drop by Stockyards for dinner. Because now that I've been, I can't wait to go back. It might have to do with the fact that they only serve their famous BBQ ribs on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday starting 5PM until they sell out.

My friend was visiting Toronto from Vancouver and wanted some fatty goodness, BBQ ribs and fried chicken sounded just perfect! I knew the restaurant would be busy and tried to get there as soon as possible after work. I arrived around 6pm with a friend and thankfully got a seat after 5 minute wait.

Ordered: Stockyards Fried Chicken Dinner 5/5

* 4 pcs of buttermilk marinated chicken served with fries, coleslaw and hot sauce for $14
* For the price you pay, this was such a good deal
* This might be the best fried chicken I've ever had
* The chicken was crispy and perfectly seasoned
* Fries were thinner cut, very crispy
* Coleslaw was refreshing and went well with chicken
* I must go back for their fried chicken!

Ordered: BBQ Rib 4/5

* Half rack for $14 and whole rack for $26
* So many people raved about their bbq ribs, I was really excited to try it out
* It wasn't fall off the bone type but still very tender
* BBQ sauce was served on the side, not your usual drenched in sauce type of ribs
* I enjoyed the ribs but didn't think they were the best I've had

Summary: I did find the restaurant really tiny and for the type of food you are eating- you need a lot of elbow room to be biting down on those bones. My friend and I sat at the bar facing the wall and it was just too tight with high chairs it was uncomfortable. If I do go back, I will probably do a take out which a lot of people seem to do. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Stockyards. Fried chicken dinner was def my favorite and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Holy heartbreak, batman.

I am writing this updated review with a heavy heart. Stopped by the 'Yards this afternoon with plans of a rainy day Porchetta sandwich. Stopped in around 2:30, which is a great time to stop by, totally empty. Somewhat limited menu on weekdays, but I knew I needed no burger, I craved no fries.

All I wanted was my Porchetta. Well it turns out the Rolling Stones were right.

WELL YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT.

Because as of two months ago, the Porchetta sandwich is no longer on the menu. I was taken aback. I teared up a little bit. I commiserated with the awesome lady at the counter, who told me people really miss it, and for her money it was the best thing she's ever eaten... So maybe it'll come back someday?

The new addition to the menu is the Cuban. 

Here's their descriptor:

The Cuban: 
Cumin and citrus roasted 
pork loin, house smoked bacon, 
mojo chimichurri, pickled onion, 
garlic mayo_$12
This replaces the Porchetta

NOTHING REPLACES THE PORCHETTA, ASSHOLES.

Umm. I mean. Sure. I'll try it. 

It's good. Are you happy now? I had a chimichuri soaked bite on the drive home, and I even moaned a bit. It's super effing tasty. I love pickled onions.

BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

So you're still getting five stars, but know how much this hurts me Stockyards. I may one day forgive you, but don't think I'll forget."}
{"text":"This place definitely has some great items, and a couple of not-as-great items. 

First, the fried chicken is not as wonderful as I would have thought, given the mostly positive reviews it's received. I found it to be overdone, and the batter crunchy to the point of breaking up and crumbling. The spice it had was nice, and the batter is fine, but I feel that the oil is too hot when they fry it, because both times I had it, it was a little too crunch-tastic for me. Don't get me wrong, Fried chicken should have crunch to it, but it should also tear and have some give as well as be crunchy. I had this dish two times, once at brunch with waffles, then again at dinner with fries. I liked the waffle one better, but the chicken had the same problem, and the sauce, although somewhat tasty, was at the same time bizarre. Great waffle, though

Second, the fries on my second visit were waaay overdone. they were way to crispy and borderline burnt. I liked them a lot the first time though.

That's all I really have to fault the place for. The Pulled pork my GF had the first visit was great, the beef brisket she had the second time was also great. 

Next time, I'm going to order a burger, or the biscuits and gravy, or the pulled chicken or anything else. I think I'll have better luck.  And when I like it the third time, I'll give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you love fried chicken, this is one of THE places to go to in all of Toronto. It was featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and it definitely lives up to the hype.  The place is incredibly small and is always busy so be sure to mentally prepare yourself to wait at least 20-30 minutes.  The staff are very pleasant and are very laid back.  Also very quick to serve and are always on the ball.  

[Mains]
The Double - Two of the most juiciest patties of custom ground beef served w/ caramelized onion, arugula, aged cheddar and stockyards mayo.  Definitely one of *the* best burgers I've ever had.  Patties were perfectly grilled on their flattop grill.  So perfect that each bite just melts in your mouth.  5+/5

Stockyards Fried Chicken Dinner - Served with 4 pieces of buttermilk marinated chicken served with fries.  The seasoning is flavorful and the chicken is cooked to perfection.  Even the white meat didn't seem at all dry which is usually the case.  The fries are like crack and you also get a good serving.  You'll find yourself picking at the fries even when you're so full.  5+/5

Be sure to also order their gingered iced tea with your meal.  Great to cleanse your palette and is also very refreshing."}
{"text":"WOW. ...What a neat place. I had been wanting to go to this place after seeing all the great reviews. I ended up going on a weekend for brunch. The wait was about 15 minutes which is reasonable for a brunch lineup. This place is super tiny, which is not at all what I was expecting but felt very intimate. The servers were very friendly and obviously at home in the place. They were very lively. Food was delicious and I can't wait to go again to have the chicken!"}
{"text":"LOVED it!
The best grease spoon there is.
Death for your arteries, but sooo worth it..."}
{"text":"Just okay for me.  We had a brisket sandwich and a fried chicken platter.  The sandwich can best be described as \"sopping\".  Not exactly exploding with flavour.  The fried chicken was...fried chicken.  A plus is that one order of fries (the chicken platter comes with it), can best be described as \"Holy Hell\" sized, as in \"Holy hell, that's a lot of fries!\"  No diet drinks available, only full-sugar varieties are offered, as that's part of their \"we're unhealthy and proud\" schtick."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch a few days ago. We arrived at around 2 PM, but because the place is teeny-tiny, we did have to wait a short while for a table. We ended up sitting at the counter at the front of the store, facing St. Clair. The weather was nice and they had opened the front windows to allow the breeze come into the restaurant, so it was actually pretty perfect.

We ordered the 4-piece fried chicken and waffles to share (between two people) with a side of coleslaw ($16 + $5). I had been looking forward to the roasted Brussel sprouts with bacon and Sriracha that is on the menu posted online, but unfortunately it wasn't available at that time =( The chicken was crispy and well-seasoned and perched atop a waffle that was on the softer side, but pleasantly eggy nevertheless. I would have preferred a more crispy waffle, but that's just me. The whole thing was doused in a glaze that was just the right mix of sweet and spicy. The coleslaw provided a nice counter-balance to this spicy-sweet-greasy goodness with its crunchy cabbage and cooling buttermilk (I believe) based dressing.

Bottom line: Great food. Reasonable price. Fun vibe. Would definitely recommend =)"}
{"text":"Went back this Friday and had the RIBS, fried chicken, BAT and pulled pork sandwhich. 
OK the chicken has improved big time. It was moist and tender and generous portions. 
The ribs really stole the show as they had a great smokey flavour. Pulled pork was great too. I called to place a pick up order and the first girl who anwsered was a bit abrupt with me when I asked to pick it up at 7:30. She huffed and then said \"ummm no, you will need call back later\" and then hung up. I was put off but luckly the next dude who answered was really nice. We will be back again to grab take out when in the west."}
{"text":"Southern fried chicken, with some wicked, beefy gravy.  definitely in the top 5 brunches I have ever had"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say it: meh, it wasn't that good.  The first time we went it was fantastic, but on a recent re-visit we were definitely under-whelmed.  Given the price, and how long you wait, I find the service weird (I had to wait 10 minutes just to pay, the gal kept leaving the cash to clear plates, chat with her buddies, move things around, it was weird) and frankly I find sometimes they're kind of snotty.  The burgers (which we waited almost 20 minutes for) were under-dressed and over-done, the fries were greasy and limp and the coleslaw is super bland. $26 for a burger and fried chicken combo?  The blush is off the rose for us; we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Attentive staff and lovely food. Busy spot so be prepared to wait a little while."}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of buzz and a lot of is very warranted.  My bf and I came in twice.  The first time around I ordered the Butter Burger and it was quite tasty and juicy and I enjoyed the meal although I don't see how it's any better than anything you'd find at Gourmet Burger.  

Second time around I order the Fried Chicken dinner. The 4 pieces of chicken were very crisp and delicious but I was disappointed that all of the pieces were breasts as I find white meat quite dull and tasteless.  One recommendation is to give customers an option of white meat (breast) or dark meat (legs and thigh). 
 
In both cases, an overabundance of fries were served. I know it's done to make the servings look generous but it is a bit much.

I appreciate the unique look of the place with vintage pieces including the old school butcher's block the cashier is placed on, but the spce is overcrowded and I really don't enjoy sitting on high chairs without any backs.  Hopefully the layout of the place will change for the better once they expand as they likely would as this is a super popular place. 

My biggest gripe though is with the staff and their underwhelming customer service.  The first time I encountered a distinct lack of warmth from the ppl behind the counter I chalked it up to a very busy time.  The second time I attended this place was during the daytime when it was far less busier and the lack of customer service was still noted.  The staff prioritizes the take-away order over the eat-ins, there is very little interaction with people sitting at the desks and there is an overall atmosphere of too cool for school emanating from them.  Not all, I might add, but the service overall needs improvement."}
{"text":"Now I know what I would order for my last meal.....cheeseburger and fries from Stockyards....with a cherry cola"}
{"text":"Sunday dinner with the family... takeout... Stockyards....scrumptious... even the dog recognizes the smell and hoovers under the table.  We always do a big order and set up the table at home buffet style.   Get ready to spend big bucks... it's not cheap.

We're seasoned customers and we expect a long line, then a 15 minute wait once our order is placed.  One downside is that they always seem to be out of whatever my wife wants to order.  Last night it was fish tacos.  Another downside is getting through on the phones to place an order for pickup.... was busy all night...Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend. I had the chicken dinner and she had the brisket sandwich. First, I was immediately impressed with how much food I got for $15. You get 4 pieces of fried chicken and a mountain of fries. My friend was about to order her own fries but I asked her not to- and it was a good choice. 

The chicken was good- nothing to write home about particularly. Although I do wish that you could choose between dark meat and white meat- because I hate white meat and the difference in tenderness between the two was very obvious. The fries were nice a crispy- but a little salty! Good thing they kept refilling my water glass. 

Real Texan BBQ was way better but this is a nice little place in the city. Would come back to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Finally made the trip to the Stockyards! From how packed this place was and the willingness of customers waiting for 20+ minutes, they should consider expanding.

The location is not exactly accessible via TTC other than street car-ing it, and parking on the street can be ridiculously hard to find. Solution: Park at the McDonalds parking lot across the street! 

The Food:
We had to order the fried chicken - it was freshly made/fried and piping hot! I welcomed a cardiac arrest devouring that plate of greasy goodness. Before I passed out into a food coma, I also tried their beef brisket sandwich. The portions are also huge, and I made a mess of myself - dropping a piece of beef on my scarf and dripping brisket juice on my lap. Yes, I am an embarrassment, I promise to wear a bib next time. 

The Service:
Amazingly upbeat staff who knows how to handle a large crowd and move around in a cramped space. Food arrived fairly quickly, but not at the same time, which was frustrating for my friend who had to watch me eat the chicken first... Sorry, I didn't share..

Bonus: They carry glass-bottled coke! Their biscuits are like a larger versions of Popeyes for around $2 each."}
{"text":"I checked out the Stockyards with a friend on Saturday night, the place was hopping!  Stockyards does not take reservations, as they have limited seating.  Luckily, when we arrived, we were seated right away.

After hearing rave reviews of their fried chicken, I had to order it.  It was a huge portion - 4 pieces of chicken, a large quantity of fries and coleslaw.  I  was only able to consume 3 pieces of chicken and had to package up more than half of my fries.  But it was really good fried chicken, I was in a fried chicken coma after the meal.

My friend ordered the beef brisket and she really enjoyed it.  She lives in the area and said that she would be back.  I will DEFINITELY be back to try out their other meaty creations on their menu. 

Hit up Stockyards if you are craving for some good meaty eats."}
{"text":"I love this place!
This was the first place I found when I moved to Toronto 3 years ago, and have gone back regularly ever since.

It's definitely on the top 3 for burgers in the city.  I won't say that it's #1, but really should it be in competition with the 20$ burger at  the Harbord Room, or any other such places in this city?

The down side of this place is that it has very little seating capacity, and as a result, there are very long lines on busy nights. (I was tempted to deduct a star for this).
The plus side is that they take phone orders, so you can take out anything they serve on the menu... and you will!

My guilty secret is that I will order the burger with bacon and cheddar, The fried chicken dinner AND a half rack of ribs for myself. (yes it feeds me the next day)... but the food is too good to decide on a single dish!

Enjoy this place... but don't stand in line all mad that there isn't enough seating.  You have been forewarned by every review before mine :P"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, a friend of mine suggested that we visit The Stockyards for lunch, so we made our way over to St. Clair and I'm glad that we did.

We ate at the bar, which only made my mouth water more than usual as I saw what was already cooking on their grill.

The coca-cola bottles in the fridge were a nice touch to my meal, and ice cold water served in stainless steel cups was refreshing.

I ordered the pulled pork w fries.  It was tender, flavorful, filling but most of all it wasn't dry! It had coleslaw on top too boot. I wasn't able to finish my fries as there was just a lot of them. I'm certainly not complaining about that though, the fries were very good and crispy (as requested). 

The price was right. If I can recall correctly $20 tops w tip. Service was great, and the cook talked to us a lot bc we were eating at the bar. 

And most importantly for The Stockyards, I will eat here again.

-Stone"}
{"text":"The stockyards is okay. That's all. Let's talk about it.

The food is nice. My burger was juicy, tasty, run of the mill. It was good, almost great just not quite there. That's all I have to say about that. If I were evaluating the place based on just the food it'd likely be a 4 or a 5.

The downfalls are too numerous to bear, and due to them I won't be returning. Firstly the wait time was about forty minutes. Now I understand waiting for good food, but waiting 40 minutes for a fast food burger, I'd expect it to come with solid gold buns. 

The service wasn't special either. Stand in the hot open kitchen style room, and wait (ages as mentioned) for them to call you. Upon receiving my food and leaving that claustrophobic nightmare I felt free, like a new man. The space within the storefront is absolutely dreadful, and that's putting it nicely. If I were a little more honest, and just a little less nice I'd tell you that it's simply horse s***. 

The decor is looney. There some smashed mirror on the wall with a slip of cardboard over it, with some nonsense written on it. I find it odd that the other seats have mirrors in front of them at all.

Anyhow good food, the rest is pretty bad."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town. Amazing porchetta sandwiches. Un-freakin-believable brisket. What else is there to say? I love this place."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.  I had the brisket sandwich, it was great.  Fries are great too.

The serving sizes are huge.  Consider splitting a side of fries instead of having everyone get one.

There's limited seating so if that bothers you consider getting takeout."}
{"text":"A delicious example of how BBQ should be done. Burgers are savoury, the grilled cheese is just the right mix of flavours, and the fried chicken dinner is some of the best in town. Worth the trip up to St. Claire if you aren't here on other errands. 

Not the best place for kids -- not that they don't accommodate or welcome kids - it's the seating that may cause some issues -- only stools at the bar available. Three plus would be appropriate -- and get a seat facing the kitchen -- the staff are friendly and it's entertaining to watch them work!"}
{"text":"Butter burger was nice and a bit different yet cook perfect. ( I always get medium) Chicken and waffles we're best I had. Sauce was sweet and spicy with chicken covered in it I was skeptical but it was amazing. They knew what they were doing . If I didn't like I would be the first to say why didn't they ask before putting it on but it was great. Lisa was amazing and service was great. Made me feel right at home.(I am from NJ)"}
{"text":"Most people think of ribs or fried chicken when it comes to The Stockyards. And that's fair, they do 'em right.  Their burgers are really, really, really good too. But what you may not know, is that they have hands down the best PANCAKES ever in the history of pancakes. For real. I don't know what it is that makes them both fluffy and yet substantial, but I do know that the lemon butter served on the side is a damn fine addition. The strips of bacon served with are thick and cooked perfectly. Not too crispy but not limp either. Go early to get a seat at the counter at the open kitchen. Staff is kind and outgoing, despite the fact they are working on a Sunday morning. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR and eat the darn griddle cakes."}
{"text":"I've like everything I've tried at the stockyards! Their burgers and fries are just the right amount of greasy and perfectly delicious. Bar none though, their biscuits are the best I've ever had. The service is always lively and spunky. Line ups can be long, but it's worth it. You can always take out and go eat outside by wychwood barns (that is, if it's nice out!)"}
{"text":"I read about this place numerous of times from other food blogs and I must say, the place definitely lives up to its hype. Food is just fantastic, fried chicken - very moist and freshly fried; pulled pork sandwich - foodgasm, just gotta have it... and don't forget their fries.. makes me drool thinking about it. I recommend this to people who just want to indulge! hahaha!"}
{"text":"3 and 1/2 stars.

Finally ventured over for lunch to meet up with DH who had daughter with him on bring to work day, and our Electric Bike Friend.  The four of us got the last of the stools in the back facing the wall.  I don't really like this stool thing, ok for lunch but i don't think i would sit there in the evening. 

The order:
2 x Buttermilk Fried Chicken:
(come with half chicken cut up into four pieces, coleslaw and fries & hot sauce $14)

The Animal Burger:
two mustard seared patties, cheese, sauce, lettuce, pickles, caramelized onion $7.50

4 x Boylans Classic Pops  $2.75 each.

The fried chicken is excellent, crispy on the outside and juicy on inside.  it doesn't need the hot sauce which i really think is franks red hot.  The fries are handcut shoestring style and perfect, i did like those dipped into the hot sauce.  The coleslaw i didn't like because of the over use of caraway seeds in it, but DH and daughter loved it, so if you like caraway it's a winner.

Had one bite of Animal Burger, cooked perfect medium rare.  A great burger if that's your fancy that day.  The Boylans are yummy just like the old days.

I wish they had the ribs & chicken at lunch, only available after 5pm...boo hoo.

Tax & tip $65

***when you do sit on the stools facing the wall, the wall is covered with mirrors, so it's not so great looking at yourself pigging out on fried chicken, or maybe it is, eat less."}
{"text":"I'm a local, and I've tried The Stockyards twice: once during the Winter, and another time during the Summer.  In both cases, I was underwhelmed by the food, and overwhelmed by the unsatisfying experience.

The very first time I went was during the Winter and had a pulled-pork sandwich and fries to stay.  Inside, people were milling about in confusion, while others that clearly ordered take-out claimed the few seats available for eat-in customers as they waited.  In the tight squeeze, no one seemed to know where to stand to order, and soon I felt like I was part of a herd of cattle waiting to become the next selection on their menu - ha!

After I finally received my order, I somehow managed to share a table with another gracious customer to eat.  As we ate, the door constantly opened and closed next to our table - sending shivers up and down my spine - and making for an uncomfortable dining experience to say the least.

The second time I visited was during the Summer and had a burger and fries to go.  Once again, the place was a ball of confusion.  And again, people stood about not knowing where to order, and many of the seats were being claimed by take-out customers waiting to receive their order.  At first, my plan was to stay; however, this time the heat was so stifling inside the restaurant (no air-conditioning) that I had to choose take-out this time around (I ate down the street on a park bench outside a local church) for fear of passing out.

The FOOD: as I said, I had a pulled-pork sandwich the first time (meh!), and a burger the second time (not too bad - so-so at best - and not very hot).  The fries were not so great each time - just passable in taste (and barely warm, which was surprising considering they should have been fresh due to the volume being cooked at the time to meet customer demand).  All-in-all, I found the food underwhelming and don't understand the accolades being allocated to The Stockyards.  In any case, I tried and wanted to like it, but didn't.

In short, they need a much larger restaurant with a double set of doors for the Winter, and air-conditioning for the Summer with a division between eat-in and take-out areas, as well as some organization to alleviate customer confusion, and they need to improve on their food (at least, what I tried).

Although I wish it weren't the case (due to its proximity), I found The Stockyards to be severely over-rated, and so I highly doubt I'll return to try it a third time."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends for some fried chicken. We waited for about 30 minutes before getting a seat. My seat was so cramped that I hardly had a space to move my arms. I wondered if the chickens we ordered were raised in the similar condition .
I ordered the 4-piece chicken with french fries. The chicken pieces were alright, but they were overcooked on the edges. One of the pieces was almost burned and did not have any juice in it. The french fries were neither crispy nor flavourful. I cannot comment on the service as I did not get any. In fact, the server accidentally spilled some water on one of my friends while we were waiting. She did not even bother to check or apologize until we pointed it out.
It would take a lot of convincing for me to give this place a second visit."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for a long time, and finally made some Stockyards brunch plans with friends over the weekend. 

I've tried fried chicken and waffles at a couple of other places and really loved it, so I knew before I got there that this is what I wanted to try. 

We got there at 9 AM on a Saturday when it opened, and by the time we left there at around 10 there were people waiting patiently for our seats. As others have stated, it's counter seating throughout this place. There are hooks towards the back (it's a small place) for your coats. 

We parked our behinds on the counter facing the kitchen, and watched as they prepared our meal - from the batter being poured, to the chicken being fried, even the thyme being de-sprigged (I know that's probably not a word but you know what I mean). Staff were friendly and chatted a bit with us. 

IT WAS SO GOOD. Perfectly crisp on the outside, moist inside (they brine it for a day or two). Really liked the fresh thyme and the sweet chili sauce they drizzled. If you're unsure you'll like the sauce, you can always ask for it on the side. Waffle was fluffy and perfect. 

You'll have a choice of 2 or 4 pieces of chicken with your waffle. Get the four. It's a lot but you can relive your experience with the leftovers in the comfort of your own home, where no one can hear your mmmmmmmmmmmmmmms. 

You will not be able to keep me away from Stockyards."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles done the good ol' Southern American way! Oh and the ribs are excellent as well.

The ONLY negatives about this place are that it isn't a bigger place and that they don't serve alcohol. Beer would be the perfect complement to this tasty food.

5*"}
{"text":"One of the best friend chicken and bang for your buck. At one point, my boyfriend and I were so hooked, we went twice in a week - we must've went to the gym twice as much that week too.

So why is the best? The skin is a major reason for me. It's so crispy and perfectly salted, you can probably get a heart attack from it tbh. But I'll still eat it. The chicken is second. Tender and cooked to perfection. It's steaming hot when it comes to you and as much as you want to let it cool, you can't help it and you burn your fingers and tongue trying to eat it in the first 5 mins. Thirdly, the fries. Those crispy, crispy, fries. It's like their deepfried 3 times or something. And you get so much of it, you likely won't finish it. 

Aside from the food, their service is awesome - quick, no chit chatting and friendly. Ahh.. Fried chicken... I am salivating just writing this review."}

My Experience:  

Stockyards is one of the highest rated Toronto spots on Yelp, and there's a reason why: It's Gaddam Delicious! The restaurant is not huge, and line ups are frequent, but the quality of service and food is outstanding. 

The fried chicken is hands down one of the best in the city, with large pieces and the perfect batter. If you're feeling particularly hungry, the burgers are made with a special technique that smashed the patty and seals in flavour. 

Different days offer different specials, so keep plan accordingly. If you're brave enough to venture out for their Sunday Brunch, it'll be well worth the wait. Friend Chicken and Waffles are a no brainer, but they make a mean biscuit and gravy! Tuesday, Friday and Sundays, at 5 pm, Stockyards services up their special BBQ Ribs, which prove to be well with the effort to grab a bite of this elusive dish. 

I've noticed that, more often than not, most people call ahead and take out, which is a great way to enjoy the meal without any long wait. The staff is beyond friendly, very laid back and full of conversation."}
{"text":"Pure mouth-watering awesomeness!
I've lived in Toronto for 3 weeks and I've been here 3 times!

Pulled pork if fantastic! 
Especially when you get some of that unbelievable bark, score!! 

I brought my boyfriend here and he had the ribs, both of our plates were practically licked clean. Great fries too!

Delicious, very affordable, quick service!

We WILL be back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and well worth the wait. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We were a party 10 which is hard for such a small restaurant but they handled it superbly. Will definitely go again the next time we are in the area!!"}
{"text":"I love the Stockyards but when I went last week, I learned that they are very recently under new management. Tom the owner, is no longer the owner. :(
Same delicious food as ever . I think it is the best burger and ribs in town, though it portions are rather small for the price."}
{"text":"I tried baby back rib, grilled chicken and a cheese burger. All are so yummy. The seating area is small so I recommend to order by phone then you come to pick up after around 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Unfinishable portions and American homestyle fried chicken to hit the spot for the nastiest of emotional cravings. I got the dinner with 4 pieces of fried chicken in a skillet with a generous side of fries. The chicken was certainly well brined and moist, tender to break under your teeth. The coleslaw was average and fries were a bit soggy and over salted. I gotta say, it's not the most communal kind of seating environment(very skinny bar table seating surrounds the edge of the shack-like diner) and you are guaranteed to come out smelling like the grease everything was fried in."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing fried chicken! The restaurant has very limited seating (around 10 people max) so we sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the cooks going back and forward and calling their orders.

The chicken itself was very tasty, it came piping hot and with a (HUGE) side of fries. It was very well seasoned and not too salty. I did find it very greasy, but I think that is to be expected.

The Stockyards is a little out of the way but well worth the trip in my opinion. Not too expensive either. If you'd prefer to eat your fried chicken in the comfort of your own home, they do take-out too!"}
{"text":"Ambience: Super busy on weekends. If you're looking to grab a seat for 2 or more, you're expected to wait more then half an hour. Most times the line up is packed at the door! Also, if you're thinking about bringing a group, the seating and space is limited.

Food: Although this restaurant is always really, really busy, their chicken and waffles are great! ($13 for 2 pcs and $16 for 4 pcs). They're a must try if it's your first time getting brunch at this restaurant. I also highly recommend their Griddle Cakes (which is only available on Sunday brunch) which comes with a whipped citrus butter, maple syrup and your choice of bacon or sausage ($10).

Their biscuits are also yum! Ask them to warm it up for you.

Service: The staff are really friendly. On the days when I am able to get seats during weekend brunch hours, me and my friends usually just watch and chat with the chefs cooking in front of or near us. 

Price: I try not to go here too often because I know I'm going to give them all of my money because the food is really good."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken. Very friendly staff. All the food was yummy. Could be a bit of a wait for a seat , but worth it."}
{"text":"Yup! Loved the fried chicken here, just wished they gave me more ; ) Crisped to perfection !"}
{"text":"I really like pulled pork and fries,very small and simple place.heard their rib and chiken fries are awsome but had not a chanse to try it cause ribs are not in menue every day."}
{"text":"Awesome. Got there at 11:45am on a Saturday morning with my kids, just in time for chicken and waffles. I was informed that they don't hold tables until everyone in the party arrived. Fortunately my family was just walking in. Sat at the counter (as there are no tables) and hung out coats under the bar. Love the maple syrup accented with cayenne. Fantastic. The kids had hotdogs and an attempt at their flat homemade sausage. The 4 piece chicken and waffles for $15 was off the hook. Everyone was super nice. The only inconvenience was having to ask for a coffee refill. Given how negligible the downside, and how high the upside, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stockyards is a southern-inspired smokehouse: ribs, pulled pork, brisket, smoked and fried chicken (plus other items) are their specialities. 

I had a chance to try the smoked ribs, brisket and pulled chicken (as a substitute for pork which they were out of) and I was very pleased with the food. We came late in the day so some of the selection (and seating) was unavailable so we decided to go with takeout and enjoy the tender morsels of smoke meat at home. 

The ribs are dry-smoked - don't expect saucy, dripping ribs - they need sauce added to them (although I did enjoy them sans-sauce, sauce definitely kicked them up a notch). 

Overall I was impressed with Stockyards - the food was good, fresh and flavorful. Having had real American BBQ/smokery, Stockyards is a great Canadian take on what it means to have food cooked \"slow and low\"."}
{"text":"When I heard that this was the go-to rib place on St. Clair, I had to check it out.  I've been to my share of rib places in my day as well as different ribfests.  This place ranks in middle of the pack.

Their ribs are not as smokey as other places, but the ribs are very meaty and reasonably priced.  I also had their fried chicken, which was disappointing as it was pre-fried and reheated on order, and served with a generous helping of fries.  They would do well to fry their chicken on order like other places.

Service was not so good, with one of the chefs talking about anime throughout the dinner.  On the plus side, they do a brisk business with their takeout menu."}
{"text":"I don't get what the hype is all about. 

Then again, this is the first time I have had southern BBQ but they make it look so goddamn good on TV I thought -- I have to try this craziness out for myself.

I found the beef brisket sandwich to be bland, full of too much sauce and frankly, nothing to write home about. I felt like it needed more salt.. or a pickle.. or.. something. 

It just wasn't great. It didn't blow my mind and make me crave it. 

I'd rather eat a Montreal-style smoked meat sandwich over these sandwiches any day and I consider those sandwiches to be of a normal standard.

The fries were very dark brown (it means they haven't changed the oil in the fryer for a long time), and were too thin / skinny which gave them a very unappealing air. I guess I'm a fry snob too ( you can chalk that up to other things I'm snobby about like cheesecake, macarons, cheese...).

I'm expecting a decent fry and I did not get it here. 

McDonald's makes better fries. I'd rather have smaller portions of fries that are of a higher quality instead of the massive basket they gave me that I didn't even eat more than a fry of.

My friend had the fried chicken and I got a piece which I found quite juicy and delicious... but the batter was gross because it was SO greasy. 

It was thin and \"crispy\".. I guess... but I basically peeled off the skin and left it (some of it was undercooked as well). 

It was better than KFC but that's not saying much.

I make a much better fried chicken at home, that's how bad this chicken was.

The batter was not 'delicious and crispy' as promised by the reviews. That, or they have no idea what good fried chicken tastes like because they have never had it made at home. *shrug* Who knows?

My other friend got the pulled pork sandwich (all 3 of us shared), and I found it kind of vomity. I can't explain it but that pulled pork with the sauce made me slightly nauseous because it was too soft.. or something. Maybe pulled pork is not my thing.

Overall, not an awful plate of food, I've eaten worse, but it is not a place that I'd trek back to, to eat. I don't get the huge line-ups and the people raving about this place. 

The place is jam-packed and tiny, so that explains why a lot of folks took food to go.

I just don't get it. My friends weren't impressed either."}
{"text":"I ordered the BAT (Bacon, arugula and fried green tomato)! I loved the lemon aioli they used, the tanginess helped cut the saltiness of the bacon and the CRUNCH on that bread was just perfect."}
{"text":"Butter burger = best burger I've ever had. 
The BAT is something special too. The only thing lacking is a place to sit."}
{"text":"My rating is solely based on the Chicken and Waffles. I wish I wrote this review earlier, since it has been over a year since I visited The Stockyards.

I remember going on a Sunday morning and having to wait close to an hour for counter seating. I vaguely remember it being a cramped and uncomfortable dining experience. But what I do recall vividly is the delicious Fried Chicken and Waffles. I guess it is true what they say about smell/taste being closely associated with memory and emotion. 

I am from Toronto but lived in Georgia for over 10 years. I've eaten my share of waffles and fried chicken individually, but never together. For the longest time, I viewed the combination as strange and could not imagine it tasting good. Thus I passed up opportunities to eat the dish at famous places like Gladys Knight & Ron's Chicken & Waffles in Atlanta and Roscoe's In LA. Ironically, I tried the combination for the first time at The Stockyards. Who would have thought I would try it for the first time in Canada.

The fried chicken is on point. It rivals the fried chicken i've had living down south in Georgia. That's saying a lot, since everything is deep fried in the South. The batter is crispy, light but definitely a little greasy. Don't expect thick crunchy breading or seasoning, since the real focus is on the chicken meat itself. The chicken is tender and incredibly juicy. 3 generous pieces of chicken come with the waffle: 1 leg, 1 breast and 1 drumstick. For $13 bucks, it's a pretty good deal. 

The waffle is soft, thick and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. It soaks in some of the grease and moisture of the chicken without becoming too soggy or heavy. Overall a decent waffle, but it definitely takes a backseat to the chicken in terms of being the star of the dish. 

What brings the dish together is the syrup. Described on the menu as \"chili maple molasses citrus glaze\", I will just call it awesome. Without this syrup, I am not sure if the chicken and waffle dish would come together so nicely. It's sweet but also spicy. This kick adds an additional flavor component to the dish and makes eating this chicken an irresistible compulsion. Selling this bottled syrup commercially would make a lot of money. Simply put, the chili maple syrup is the bomb. 

Anyways, this is definitely a gem of a restaurant in Toronto, where BBQ and American comfort food are generally lacking. I will be back to try their BBQ ribs and burgers. Just be prepared to wait for a seat. Also keep in mind that the seating is not very comfortable, due to the small physical space of the restaurant. Take out is not a horrible idea."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I took a group of students here after watching a Triple D episode. They only make 30 of the signature burgers a day. That's a bit tiny. Anyway what we did have wasn't great. Some had the fried chicken and said KFC was better?!  One of the girls had the BAT sandwich and said it was ok. The hamburger I had was good but not seasoned enough for me. Three dollars extra for fries seems excessive with the price they charge for the burgers.
The wait staff was a highlight, friendly and outgoing. They met our need and split up the bill for us after the fact."}
{"text":"The burger, the hot dog and beef brisket were amazing. Fast friendly service. Eat here in confidence!"}
{"text":"Awesome food shame on the service. That's three times in a row they've been either unnecessarily rude, forgot about our order or put our order in a to go and after they closed they remembered on ya they were sitting right there the whole time.

I run a small business, mistakes can be made but it's just too many here. Also I saw they have the buns from the grocery store (dempsters) and well that just doesn't cut it. 

There are plenty of local bakeries with much better bread. 

Too bad so much potential."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is hands down one of my go to spots for some awesome meat eating.

I've tried their steak with chimichurri and definitely recommend. I've also tried their burgers which are definitely in the running for best in the city. My boyfriend's favourite however is the chicken and waffles. We have yet to try the pulled pork because we usually just go with our faves, but definitely have to give it a try next time because everyone there/on yelp raves about it! I have also been here for brunch and while there is usually a small wait for a table? the ladies at the front are so charismatic and hardworking that you know they're working as fast as they can to flip tables.

This is a place you would definitely go out of the way to try! Will always be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great family diner feel. Friendly staff and quick food. Their pulled pork and brisket is amazing and the fried chicken is to die for. From a guy who learned his BBQ in the South, I recommend this place.

Expect a line up."}
{"text":"The place is tiny and super casual - all stool seating with an open kitchen. We went on Saturday around 2pm - waited in line for about 10 minutes and got seated...yay!

Despite the place being swarmingly busy, I found the server and hostess/cashier to keep very calm and friendly. Efficient but not frantic. 

Even more impressive was watching the chefs and cooks! They were calm cool and collected, had such great communication (no screaming like with Gordon Ramsay), and pumped out sooooo many meals in front of our eyes! They've got great team chemistry and very obvious bromancing lol. 

Delicious fries, beef brisket sandwich was okay (but not recommended), and chicken waffles were BOMB DOT COM - met the hype for sure! Super crispy, fresh and juicy chicken, nice flavour and perfect batter. Recommended with a side of bacon and extra sauce. One of my favourite chicken & waffles in the city yet and good value for portion size. 

Will def be back to satisfy chicken and waffles cravings!"}
{"text":"Good food, missing numerous things on the menu though and terrible cross-contamination. I traveled here all the way from Iowa to try this. 

We showed up at 4:00pm on a Tuesday and met a short 3 minute wait for a seat at the bar where we could watch the food being cooked right in front of us. I ordered the BAT which was fantastic. My wife ordered the pulled pork. A few minutes later we were notified that they were out of pulled pork and pulled brisket. So she orders a burger. The burger was decent but right before the cook went to put the completed sandwiches on our plates, with his bare hands,  he had just touched raw burgers, with his bare hands. There was no attempt to hide the fact that he did this and there was not even a sink in sight if he so desired to wash his hands. 

That really ruined the meal for us. We quickly ate and left disgusted."}
{"text":"Stockyards. The place ALL my NOBLO friends seem to rave about. Okay, let's try it out.

You walk in facing a giant grill-top, bar seating, and the smell of the fryer. Basically, your diet is on hold for now (they don't even carry diet soda). I went big and got the fryer, a 4-piece chicken dinner on freshly cut french fries, that could have been shared between two. 

It was incredible. I'm definitely returning (perhaps next time for take-away)."}
{"text":"WOW! Simply delightful. 
For the ones who might not know, this place is one of the only place in Toronto with a fire wood oven. I had the opportunity to eat the ribs out of the fire wood oven (I've been told that they sell out fairly fast And it's available only on certain days) 
The flavor, the aroma, the tenderness- all was spot on! Definitely the best I've had. 

Also had the fried chicken, which was pretty rad! However not as good as the ribs in terms of the flavor. 

All In all- I'm a fan of this place in one visit. Can't wait to go back to try out their breakfast items. 
 
4 stars- because I'm waiting to try other items, based on the ribs this place is a 6/5!"}
{"text":"Great find on St. Clair. As the construction goes a few blocks west of where the streetcar stops.
Very busy with a line up out front. Friendly energetic staff. The ribs go fast, and we were there on Friday which is rib night.
The place is small with only about ten stools, half at the counter watching the cooks and staff prepare the many orders.
We had rib tips, delicious, pulled pork sandwich, melt in your mouth, and the crispy fried chicken. The side was fries which were awesome. 

There was at least on vegetarian friendly sandwich on the menu and the hamburgers looked awesome, we'll have to come back.

We chatted with the staff including the owner/chef and his wife. Very, very nice."}
{"text":"I got the Fried chicken over belgian waffles with chili maple molasses citrus glaze and it was DELICIOUS. Sweet, tart, but not overly spicy, the chicken cooked just right. My partner had a cheeseburger and fries, and those were also very good. Food came pretty fast too, for such a busy place."}
{"text":"Ambience: Functional 
Food: 5/5 (Notes: Ton of choice, quality is nothing to complain about. Enjoyed the food)
Service: 3/5 (Friendly)
Value: 4/5 
Repeat: Ofcourse!

One of my favourites in the city."}
{"text":"Let me just start with I have yet  to find a burger as good as the one I get from here (and there limeade is pretty damn good too...)

Food was awesome, the burger was perfectly moist and extra bacon I ordered was definitely worth it (it was a nice thick cut too!) I also got a limeade which on its own was delicious (but would have been perfect with a few shots of whiskey, but I wont complain, haha ;))

Overall, food&drink was awesome, like an 11/10, kinda awesome.

The service is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Went to the Stockyards on Friday afternoon September 4. Ordered a fried chicken dinner and a ginger-lemon iced tea.
The chicken is delicious with lots of meat and the coating is not too thick. Fries are excellent ans go really well with the homemade hot sauce, which also makes a great dip for the chicken. The coleslaw is not my favourite but is good. I suspect a touch of horseradish in the recipe.
The 4 pieces are big and the dish is really a big portion. The iced tea washes down everything nicely. That fried chicken does not stop my love affair with Chick-N-Joy in the Beaches, but is delicious enough for an occasional fling.  Next time I will try one of their dirty 30 burgers.
The service is awesome and the staff is friendly. The vintage/old time diner atmosphere is charming and the hipster factor is firmly under control.
Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Seriously good well-done fried food and diner-style grilled cheese. This place is so unhealthy, but in a good way. An indulgence for sure. 

Faves for this Pescatarian: 
Trout sandwich (minus the bacon wrapping) on bready bread. 
Fish tacos
Grilled Cheese

They've got a butter roller on the grill- you roll a slice of white bread on the roller, which brings up some hot, melted butter to slather on your bread before making the most delicious grilled cheese ever. 
The new kitchen must-have!"}
{"text":"Food was great but server was extremely unfriendly. While I understand that it's a small location, I was all but thrown out of my seat the moment we finished eating. Not a place I would want to go back to during peak lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say that hasn't been said. The chicken & waffles, fried chicken dinner, sausage & biscuits, ribs, beast-style burger - all warrant their own visit. The brunch line can be pretty unwieldy during peak times; fortunately they serve it until 3. Chicken & waffles available daily - a nice touch. Take-out is advisable as space is quite tight with the restaurant at capacity."}
{"text":"There are those days when you get really busy and don't have time to eat until later. I walked into Stockyards pretty late, and right out of the gate, they didn't make me feel like a douche for walking in before closing. I only had time to get the classic burger, and a delicious side of Mexican corn! The burger is always fresh, and perfectly done. Every single time. The Mexican corn had a nice sweet heat and savory flavor to it. They change up their vegetable sides, so it won't always be available... Don't worry about it. Everything is quality here. It's small so showing up expecting a group of 10 to fit during peak times might not happen. They do a brisk takeout business as well. Try them out!"}
{"text":"came here for brunch. Overall I was not very impressed considering how glowing the reviews are. Fried chicken and waffles were ok. I honestly couldn't remember much about it except that there was a hint of sweetness in the chicken. Biscuits with gravy were just ok also. 

I didn't find the place overpriced at all. If it was, it was just a tad. The place was small but we got the front area which was spacious enough to accommodate a stroller so that was a pleasant surprise.

Next time ill be trying lunch or dinner. It has to be better."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch on a weekday and was seated right away at the bar table. I really like the look/atmosphere of the restaurant and the servers were great. I ordered a chicken and waffle (my first time having it) and thought it was odd but wasn't horrible.

I would come back in the future to try their other items."}
{"text":"FatCat not like to feel like FatCat eating food inside subway station. But stock yards store design remind FatCat more of St Claire station than inside of real restaurant.  But no problem for FatCat because he like the food.

 - Potions - FatCat never leave stockyards hungry before.

Things FatCat not like
 - People accidentally running into FatCat on their way to bathroom because restaurant so small.  Mr Owner, please buy coffee shop next door and use space to make restaurant bigger.  FatCat give Mr Owner 4 stars if Mr. Owner take FatCat advice.

{"text":"Decided to check this place out after an afternoon of out door skating.  Everything I read said it was the \"it\" place for bbq/fried chicken. 

Arrived around 5:30 just before the mad dinner rush.  Only 4 other people. Great,we had the place all to ourselves. 

No one greeted us, no one seated us, no one set out plates, etc. Good thing chef wasn't too busy or else no one would have taken our order. 

We finally ordered the fried chicken dinner, a classic burger and an order of fries to share. 

Chicken came almost immediately, but no place settings. Oh well, you  are suppose to eat fried chicken and fries with your hands, right??  

Burger came about 10 minutes later along with napkins, plates , fork and knife. Oh yea, and water. 

Chicken was 4 good size pieces. It had a nice crispy coating and juicy inside. Loads of shoe string fries. One order was more than enough for 2. 

Burger was really good but looked a little lonely all on its own on the plate. Chefs thumbs prints/indentations in the bun took away from the appearance a little as well.  I hate it how nice fresh  bread  gets squashed so easily, means you have to be careful, who has time for that? 

Overall not a bad \"greasy dinner\" type place. I have had much better else were in the city. Electric Mud, Big Crow, Barque Smokehouse, Hogtown Smoke, Burgers Priest. ..........

Did not live up to the hype, plus the three sad faces above, I gave it three stars and that is giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was a off night.  Maybe it was because it was snowing outside, always throws Torontonians for a loop."}
{"text":"After reading in several publications that The Stockyards was the cats pyjamas when it came to slow cooked, melt in your mouth, saucy, sticky, beautiful BBQ, I took to Yelp with a flash, tossed open my browser and counted my cash. Seeing so many sterling reviews here I knew this was a YAM in my books (Yelp Automatic Must).

Located on St. Clair Ave West near Oakwood, I recommend you park on a side street and use a map app to help you find your way (the sign is small and very easy to miss). However, use the McDonald's as a reference point, SY is roughly across the street.

As my check in tip said \"So excited for my first stockyards experience. Wings, brisket, pulled pork, burgers and ribs. OH MY!!!\"

...I was more than excited to have some ribs or brisket (as good versions of these meats is sometimes difficult to find) but alas, SY only does ribs on select days (Tues, Fri and Sun), so I stomped my feet and had a little temper tantrum while I looked over the menu glumly.

My friend knew exactly what she wanted:
The Butter Burger: 
bone marrow, blue cheese red wine butter, onion frites,butter lettuce $9

However, I was having a little trouble after having my rib tooth denied (shakes fist). Around the same time that I had cleared the tears from my eyes, I noticed the most curious thing coming out of the kitchen in waves: Fried Chicken ?? Qu'est-ce au nom de Dieu était que??????

I tore open my menu, and flipped on my Yelp app to discover that not only is the Fried Chicken plentiful but its a YANFAV (Yelp-Fan-Fav). I immediately ordered it.

For those interested here is the menu description of the Fried Chicken:
4 pcs. of Buttermilk marinated chicken (YA 4 OF THEM!!!)
served with fries, coleslaw, and hot sauce $14

It arrived in no time, piping hot and extra crispy. I've said it before and Ill say it again...OHHH EMMMM GEEEEE! My first bite released of torrent of juice that would rival a Florida Orange. Paired with shoestring fries that made me forget about McDonald's across the street. Simply ......SCRUM-TRULESCENT. 

I finished the Chicken with little trouble but my BBQ cravings have been left wanting. It was kismet what occurred that warm Saturday afternoon. I WILL be back Stockyards, oh yes I will. Voracious and Determined. But Until that day, I will survive off the pleasant memory of those 4 little buttermilk battered chickies that made me smile and giggle with delight (tee-hee)"}
{"text":"last time i tried the fried chicken  and smoked chicken, they were good, i had so many times chicken in my life, i have hard time to be impressed
this time i tried the ribs and whoua, the flavor, everything was amazing, perfectly cooked and seasoned, ultra super tender, i'm so going again this week for the ribs"}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I've ever had! I got the Classic Burger combo. The patty was full of flavour and juicy. There was a good bun to patty ratio which is key in a burger for me. The bun was soft and delicious. Not overly messy. I asked for avocado or guac which they don't offer it but it didn't need it after all. I'm not usually crazy about shoestring fries but these were salty and addictive. They kinda reminded me of Swiss Chalets but thinner. Paid $13 for my combo. 

*Please note I originally ordered the fried chicken and waffles but was disappointed when the waiter pointed out that it's only served until 3pm. Oh well, just another reason to go back, although it'll be hard for me to not get the burger. YUM!

**and the seating is limited/no such thing as personal space here"}
{"text":"Love. Love.  Love .. Ribs are good. Burgers are good  rib tips are good . The fries are good and coleslaw and garlic dip ...service is usually good"}
{"text":"Big fan of their fresh fried chicken. I order it on the phone and pick it up. Busy street so parking is difficult, so One person usually drives and waits in the car as I hop out."}
{"text":"I hate to be the non meat eater to give this place only three stars, but here goes. Everything tastes better with butter, and no, Stockyards did not come up with that concept, in fact while most restaurants are trying out healthy options Stockyards is going just the opposite way. So much salt fat and fried food crossed my plate today I can hardly feel my toes. Talk about a fat coma! 

And while I loved our spunky waitress and her cooking companions I could have done with just a little less of all of the above. I had the biscuit, you must have one of these, served with a side of house made lemon butter and jam, it was pretty much out of this world. I proceeded to imbibe the eggs Tommy sans andouille with fried green tomato. Here's what happened, my tongue couldn't taste anything after the first couple of bites. It was a salt attack, I feel like it was in the batter and the hollandaise and even the shrimp. Please know, I LOVE salt, as in I put extra on my McDonald's fries when I eat them, but this was too much. The concept of deep fried poached eggs was highly unique, but I don't think I would get it again. And the hash browns were one big mess of seasoning salt that the sweet ketchup couldn't even cut through. 

One of the tastier items were the daily benoits filled with Dulce de leche. Fried to gooey perfection and smothered in icing sugar, I really should have stopped there. Before I finish this review I want to throw out a few pet peeves. First, I know this is a mad meatery filled with burgers and fried chicken, but you can't make me your famous grilled cheese, just because it's not on the brunch menu!?! And beyond that, I'm requesting everything without meat, I am saving you money by not eating your meat, can't you pass along the savings to me? Especially since there were absolutely NO vegetarian options available. Second, it is hot as balls in there, but I can't order whatever I want to go? You are the restaurant, I am the customer, make it to go, please! 

I don't want to put across that I highly dislike this place, but I am certainly not head over heels like many of my fellow Yelpers. And no I probably won't be back anytime soon, simply because my arteries have to clear out, and I can spend $15.00 on something that really makes my mouth water. Meat eaters, from the sounds of chomping, slurping and moaning, there were several happy carnivores in the house. Shari M, Adeel O and Chris P included. 

Bottom line...this menu wasn't conducive to my 15 km a week running addiction or my vegetarian inclinations. But you should try it once at least, just take your heart healthy Aspirin beforehand."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon to take advantaged of their smoked meats.  Arrived at around 4:50pm (they open at 4:45pm on Sundays) and my friends and I managed to grab the last 3 seats.  My one friend got a burger with bacon and fries, the other ordered fried chicken while I got some smoked ribs with fries and an iced tea which was home brewed with lemon and ginger.  The fries were nicely cooked though perhaps a bit thin though for my taste.  The ribs were perhaps the finest I've ever tasted as they were amazingly juicy and bbq sauce that came with it was a perfect match (the vinegar in the sauce cuts through the richness of the meat very nicely).  I devoured everything within minutes. The iced tea was quite nice (the ginger was a great touch) but was a touch too sweet for my taste.   My friend said that his burger was the best he had ever had (it smelled incredible).  My other friend said the fried chicken was beautifully crisp on the outside while insanely moist on the inside (as if it was poached). Service was friendly but very rushed as it was insanely busy inside.  Even though it was a madhouse in there everything seemed to be well organized and in good order.  I was amazed as we were eating because the owner began shouting out at approximately 5:10pm, there was a countdown on the smoked chicken and  about 10 minutes later they announced they were out of smoked chicken and the greens of the day.  It's clear that this place is extremely popular and for good reason.  I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Visiting TO (my home town), i ate this food 3 of 9 days.
Twice at the counter, and one Sunday night dinner that friends takes out every Sunday night.
His son LOVES the ribs, and so do I.
Ribs are made on fri and Sunday, avail at 5pm..
This chef has travelled to research BBQ from the masters before he opened.
Fried chicken is excellent, and so is the burger.
Great staff.

{"text":"I love it when people write bad reviews about Stockyards or how they complain about how hard it is to get to.  That will hopefully make the long lines and waits a little shorter.   Honestly though, reading a bad review about this place is like telling Gretzky he was just an average hockey player.  You just have to laugh.  

I'm not one to heap praise on places as I feel that too many people are throwing praise around like it's candy.  To call something the best it better be the best tasting meal and that also means having consistency, freshness, cleanliness and good customer service.  I can say with a clear conscious that this is my favourite barbecue/fried chicken/burger restaurant in Toronto - hands down.  I still haven't found anything in the menu I don't like.  My top 4  favourites are:

1. Ribs!  The best.  Love the vinegar based dipping sauce
2. Butter Burger.  Excellent. Slightly greasy and flavourful.
3. Fried Chicken.  Better than any I have ever had. 
4. Beef Brisket sandwich.  Very good!

Yes the line-ups are long, the ribs run out and are only served certain days of the week and place is small.....but it's all worth it.  I love this place and I'm lucky enough to live close by.

So keep those negative reviews coming it will help reduce my waiting time to chow down!"}
{"text":"Brilliant fried chicken with a decent serving of sides. The biggest issue with this place is the constant lineup and the lack of comfortable seating space. It's time to move to a bigger space!"}
{"text":"What's with all the hype about this place? I know there's general scarcity of decent BBQ places around Toronto, but seriously this is nowhere near the level all the reviews will lead you to believe.

My personal experience consisted of a pulled pork sandwich and a pancetta wrapped smoked trout (with fries on the side for good measure). First the pulled pork. The meat itself was nothing special, a little bit on the dryer side, lacking tenderness and could definitely use some more smoking time. And no, I could not detect any of the apple/hickory flavours (and none of my friends could either). The sauce was quite a disappointment too. A character lacking thin sour-sweet mixture. You want to feel the difference try some of the sauces from our neighbours south of the border, or even go to one of the local rib fests and you're bound to encounter way better options. The trout sandwich on the other hand could have been a nice idea, had it not been for a crazy amount of salt they put into it (and into everything else for that matter). Is that salt on my fries or fries on salt? Keep going to this place on a regular basis and pretty soon you'll be feeling dryer than King Tut on his 20th birthday. So I don't know, it's either that I don't know squat about BBQ or my palate is queer, but either way I'm not going back.

P.S.
In case salt doesn't finish you off, try Boylan's Black Cherry pop. The amount of sugar in that one ought to do the job."}
{"text":"Stockyards will bring you happiness. Come eat here, and enjoy every second of it. The venue is small which seems to be a Toronto trend but it's worth the tight squeeze and the service is quick and efficient. 

I had to try the chicken and waffles based on all the other yelp pics and they were right, it's freaking fantastic!! The chicken is breaded perfectly and fried to a crispy perfection. Served over a fresh waffle that ain't overly sweet and drizzled generously with a maple chili glaze to top it off was heavenly. 

I also tried the stockyard sandwich which was bomb! Served on a fresh delicious biscuit with a DEEP FRIED POACHED EGG! Insanely good! 

They perfected their limited menu and I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The food here is overhyped. I had the chicken dinner which was a lot of food. The problem was the chicken was too dry and quite salty. The fries were great. It's the type of fries you could eat without ketchup because they had so much flavour. 

I wouldn't recommend dining in during the summer as it can get quite hot. Call ahead and order take our. The space is small."}
{"text":"On our continued tour of 'Best of Yelp: Toronto' we stopped into The Stockyards today.  At 3:45 p.m. on a snowy Saturday afternoon the place was already hopping, near full, but just enough space for us to grab a space at the bar (FYI -- only option is bar seating).  

Inspired by our friendly bar neighbour my husband got the Double burger and is still raving about it.  He ranks it as one of the 'top 3' of all time (although unable to list the other top 2....) -- and used words such as juicy, succulent, and phenomenal to describe his gastronomic experience.  I went with the cider braised pork on sourdough --equally good I do believe (although I am less expressive about my food).  The side of fries and coleslaw were equally good.

Only reasons The Stockyards didn't get 5 stars: i) $44 for a burger lunch is a bit pensy for the type of joint, ii) the sheer weight of the food and the near-induced food comas we experienced as a result of eating there, and iii) the space needs to be bigger

Note the homemade Ginger Ice tea and lemonade are worth trying too."}
{"text":"The best time to go is in the afternoon. There was no wait time for a table which was a great way to start.  

The fried chicken was crispy, tender and juicy. The fries done just right.  Brisket sandwich surprising good (I'm not a big beef fan).  We wanted to try the pulled pork sammy but they were sold out.  

The decor, street-window facing seats and Coke served in nostalgic glass bottles added to the experience.  

Would drive into the city again for the Stockyards."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is a neighbourhood favourite in the St. Clair West area. They offer everything from burgers, to fried chicken, fries, ribs, pulled pork sandwiches, ribs and etc. I've had many of the burgers and one common thing about them is that they are cooked just right. Always so juicy and delicious! I am a big fan of the fries! They are so greasy and delicious. They remind of McDonald's fries but more of a home made taste. The pulled pork is soft and flavourful and one is already so filling. The fried chicken is cooked just right. It's crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. It's a good choice for those craving kfc, but better and less greasy. 

I like the feel when you dine-in. It has an old rustic diner bar feel. The staffed friendly and approachable and their menu is simple. The only hard part is deciding what to get. Oh the choices! I will warn you though that it gets really busy here and the wait is a little long at times. I am always patient knowing that at the end of the wait, is a delicious meal. I do appreciate a good meal!

P.s. You have to try the ribs!

This is a place to check out! If you are a bbq connoisseur"}
{"text":"If you're coming to Stockyards, you MUST get the Deep Fried Chicken with Fries. Trust me when I say this, it's absolutely delectable, and you won't feel chubs after - I think they drain a lot of the grease out of it, so it ends up light, crispy, and not heavy on the stomach. I also love that they don't put a ton of breading on it. 

The fries are great! Kinda like mini-home fries. Again, no breading, which makes it a light side.

The only downside was we ordered 20 minutes ahead of time, which they told us to do, but ended up waiting 40 minutes for the food. The place was packed though, so I understand they were busy, but perhaps giving more realistic timelines for those ordering take out would be advisable. 

Staff are ok, not the friendliest place in Toronto, but honestly, I'm really only going there for the food. I would also take out as there is VERY limited seating."}
{"text":"Laughing stock. Place changed owners and went south. 

The \"bbq\" beef brisket was so meh - I had Rosh Ha'Shana briskets that were better. Not in my back yard!"}
{"text":"Had the Fried Chicken dinner.  Might have been the best fried chicken I've ever tried. 

The place was busy with activity.  If you are going to get take out, call a head and place your order.  

Can't wait to go back and try their Pulled Pork!"}
{"text":"Went out for lunch with my daughter. Although it is Christmas Eve and everyone is in the mode of when can I go home and relax for four days, the people at Stockyards were more than happy to serve and cook. Their menu was a touch less than the norm, guess they are getting ready for the holidays too! Yet, the food was nothing short of excellent. They put together a special burger for me and my daughter had the fried chicken. Both were superb. Will certainly come back again.

{"text":"I\"ve been waiting a long time to come here and it definitely didn't disapoint. 

I love fried chicken and just the thought and site of Stockyards has me drooling. I think this is the best fried chicken place that i've been to in the city (#1 would be Willie's in New Orleans). In addition, my second favourite place is Broaster's Chicken which is where the old D&J's use to be at Alton Tower's in Markham.

I ordered the fried chicken dinner here and it was awesome. I am very picky with my fries and I absolutely loved the fries....and you have to ask for the garlic mayo, it is really good!

also, the lady working at the counter was super nice. Didn't catch her name but she was really friedly which added to the experience. The burgers looked really good too, but I guess that's for another time. 

All in all, definitely a place to go for fried chicken in the city - too bad they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"If you ever watched the movie \"The Help\" you probably remember the fried chicken scene where they bite into it and all you hear is this beautiful loud crunch. Thats how fried chicken should be - a nice crispy skin instead of soggy and greasy.

Stockyards has mastered this. Great, crispy, non greasy friend chicken thats brined in buttermilk and has a very slight kick to it. The portions are great, price is even better. 

Small place, not fancy but oh so worth it!"}
{"text":"just call me pigpen

It's been a while since I left a new restaurant smiling ear-to-ear.  And by new I  mean, new to me.  It's not that I haven't tried to go to Stockyards.  I have - many times - but I always fail.  I get lazy, especially on weekend mornings and St. Clair seems likes Richmond Hill when you're all the way downtown.

But last Sunday I got my butt in gear because my sister was in town and I wanted to be sure she left with something yummy in her tummy.  She can get particularly rabid if not fed well.  

We arrived at Stockyards and found ourselves second in line.  There was a party of four in front of us.  As soon as we got seated, we were brought water.  Then we were brought coffee (in gigantic cups; I love cute big things), and then they took our order.  Pretty super and all with a smile.

It was OBVIOUS to my sister and I that we would be sharing the chicken and waffles.  We added the Whole Nine Yards and got started.  Everything on Nine Yards' plate was so flavourful.  Deep fried poached eggs, fried green tomatoes, sausage patties and the most spectacular piece of bacon. So smoky, meaty and tender.  I could write a song about that bacon. 

The chicken and waffles were bad ass. The plate was like magic served with a subtle sprinkling of rosemary.

Fluffy waffles that witheld their bounce and didn't get soggy.  AMAZING crispy fried chicken.  There is only one thing that describes what happens when you bring crunchy flavourful chicken together with belgian waffles and then douse it with some seriously lickable chili maple syrup with a hint of citrus: --------------!

I swore right there.

Stockyards is a cute spot - relaxed and welcoming, though small and a bit cramped (bar seating) - that serves up rich savoury flavours for brunch.  It just got added to my list.  My list is THE list - where fabulous people brunch."}
{"text":"- fried chicken and waffles. dont eat anything else.
- wash it down with their mint-infused lime-ade.
- btw - stop showing up. i hate waiting in line."}
{"text":"Little needs to be said about this gem on St. Clair before your mouth is watering and you're longing for the best bbq of your life:
- On site smoked meat using tried, tested, and true traditional smoking and curing methods
- A South Carolina-style vinegar and red pepper sauce - a perfect complement to the meat
- Buttermilk marinated deep fried chicken dinner (3 pieces!)
- Ribs.

Pretty much THE best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. Just the right amount of saucy mess, a perfect little bun, hand-cut fries or delicious sautéed kale and limeade infused with mint. If you play your cards right, you just may be the lucky patron who snags the last of the bacon-dipped donuts. 

This place is not for the health conscious or vegetarian-eating individuals. 
The hours are a bit weird so be sure to check them before heading over.
They should also look into shares for on-site automated external defibrillators. Just saying.

Honourable mentions:
- home-made limeade infused with mint
- Sit at the bar and watch the magic unfold"}
{"text":"The Good: It's been raining since the early morning so it would explain why we didn't have to wait as soon as we got in. Probably around 10 people were inside. No wait! Awesomeness.

We ordered their popular chicken and waffles, a biscuit, and a side of house hickory side bacon. The presentation for C&W was nicely done and the biscuit was soft and buttery. Their marmalade on the side went very nicely with it.

I liked the bacon in all its salty goodness and it was thick cut. Bonus points for that!

Chicken was crispy and juicy.

Service with a smile. 


The Bad: The chicken definitely was not freshly made. It was lukewarm by the time we cut our knives through it. The waffle was soft, but the outside was not crispy which is what one would expect from a traditional breakkie food. I suspect that the chicken was made ahead of time with the expectation that there would be more customers but since it was a slower day due to the rain, the chicken just didn't do it for me.


The Overall: Slightly disappointed by today's experience. Since they are well-known for the C&W, I expected it to be hot (especially today's cold and wet weather).


Revisit: Yes. I'd def give it a try with their pork dishes."}
{"text":"We had breakfast and we will go back for seconds. Awesome food. The sausage and biscuits smothered in gravy were very good. I am going to try the fried chicken next. We both really enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the guys work - it was intoxicating - like a dance. They are really good. Their smoked meat is excellent - I cannot say anything other than go try it yourself. You will be pleased. The place is small - expect to wait and be patient. Remember what they say about those who wait. :)"}
{"text":"The fried chicken and waffles were amazing! I thought the two would clash but the savory syrup tied everything together. The chicken was a little too hard on the outside but the insides were fresh and succulent.

Will chow-down here yet again!"}
{"text":"5/5 - Delicious

Best fried chicken in Toronto. That's all you need to know.

The burgers are damn good too. They aren't at Harbord Room-level, but just one-tier below it.

Definitely get there as early as you can because they sell out. Which will just leave you so so sad."}
{"text":"AMAZING FRIED CHICKEN !! Ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed. The chicken is juicy and well seasoned and crunchy. They use some kind of syrup hot sauce hybrid on the chicken and waffle. Absolutely the most wonderful chicken and waffles I've ever had in my life. My wife got the griddle cakes with sausage and she loved it. What an amazing find. Considering going back to Canada just for THE STOCKYARDS!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in yesterday at 6pm and snagged seats at the counter right away. The place started getting packed not long after though so timing is everything with this teeny little spot! 

I got the beast burger thanks to a VERY enthusiastic review from a coworker and my boyfriend got the fried chicken dinner. 

THE BURGER:
Juicy and delicious. Whatever that secret sauce is, it gets two thumbs up. Absolutely divine. It's a straightforward burger that involves essentially unhinging your jaw to get a proper bite - my favourite kind! The only downside though (and the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5) is that the bun... Was soggy. Big no-no. Now here's the thing: I'm not a texture eater, so the feeling of the soggy bun was not an issue. I couldn't care less. The problem is that a good, firm bun acts as a relatively impenetrable gate for the juicy, saucy meatiness it surrounds. A soggy bun that falls apart with each bite means that rivers of burger grease make their way down your hands, forearms, and eventually reach the table via your elbows, ruining a cheap sweater you don't really care about anyway but it's what you chose to wore on this particular date so it's a good thing your boyfriend doesn't own any non-stained clothing and thus cannot say a word about your current predicament.

THE FRIED CHICKEN:
Holy CRAP. I'm getting this next time. After I inhaled my soggybunburger and lamented over my poor decision not to order fries on the side (seriously, guys. Why the extra charge for fries?? It's an age-old pairing and the two should not be kept apart by a whole $2.50 when my burger itself was already $15!), my boyfriend turned to me with a shameful look on his face and muttered, \"I'm full.\" TIME TO STRIKE. I grabbed one of his pieces of chicken and dove into it, full speed ahead. Dear god. I'm not a fried chicken kinda girl... Correction, I WASN'T* a fried chicken kinda girl, but Stockyards made me a believer. Flawless batter, juicy, generous pieces of chicken, and fries that taste as though they've rained down from the heavens above.... 10/10. Bravo. I'm positive this Stockyards dish will be the reason I (very contentedly) die of heart disease.

THE DRINKS:
What the heck?? No BEER? At a FRIED FOOD joint?? I couldn't even get a Diet Coke, which is infinitely worse. So, I pitifully sipped on my water while silently cursing the fact that this little shortcoming will not rob the 'Yards (new nickname, dibs) of a star on its rating since the food is just too damn good. 

All in all: I'm totally coming back, but I'll stick to the fried chicken and leave the beer to the pubs and the burgers to the Priest."}
{"text":"A five dollar burger for Burger Week that was GREAT!  Note to self: Chicken fried steak has nothing to do with actual chicken.  Juicy, moist, flavourful, sooooo good...

We also ordered the fried chicken plate that came with four crispy, juicy pieces served with fries and slaw.  Can one person seriously eat this much in one sitting?

Everything was washed down with homemade limeade.  Perfect.

This could've been a five star review but there was no AC.  I think it was hotter inside than it was outside.

Still a fan regardless.  Get takeout and have a picnic instead!  :)"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Definitely worth the trip to st Clair and dufferin. The meat was delicious and there was a ton of options. It's a tad cramped so it may be more appealing for take out as opposed to dining in because it may be a bit of a. Wait. Overall it was good service. Love how there's an open kitchen concept where you can see the food being made."}
{"text":"It is a small place but the food is a delicious treat when you have an urge for fried foods. Pay parking is directly across the street. Fried smoked chicken is a first but I'll try the pulled pork next go around."}
{"text":"Sigh. I really wanted to try this place. But couldn't get over how disorganized they are. I understand that they get busy. But when you approach them for service, it shouldn't be met with sarcasm or insults. And when called out on it, they definitely shouldn't be confrontational and unapologetic.

I will never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever walk into this place again.

If I could, I would give it ZERO stars."}
{"text":"The food is stellar but the customer service was frustrating.  The food would be a 4.5 rating and the service, if factored in, would be a `1.0.
Granted the place was very busy on Friday night, but the person taking our order inconsistently asked customers who had been waiting, for what seems like forever, if they wanted water and apologized to some for the extended delay in receiving the food.  We did not get an apology or asked if we wanted some water; apologies should be consistent and not reserved for particular customers.

The restaurant is a landmark in the St. Clair West area and always busy.  With that, it seems that customer service can be overlooked and taken for granted.  I don't need my ass kissed, but I do expect some consistent respect from a place I am frequenting.  Being a hip, popular joint doesn't absolve you of being thankful and acknowledging the wait many of your customers had to endure."}
{"text":"Yummiest, juiciest fried chicken I've ever had! Place is small but welcoming and watching the food being made by those very energetic workers is entertaining. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Recently having discussions about \"what makes a restaurant get 5 stars?\" and then, lo and behold - Stockyards did just that.  

I haven't been here since 2012!! What have I been thinking!

Line up already forming by 4:45 pm on a Sunday.  We snagged seats by the open window, since it was lovely outside.  You do get dine-in service so you can wait here for your server.  Waters brought quickly and refreshed often.  

We got the half rack rib special and a fried chicken dinner to share.  Appreciated that the waitress told us not to order more sides because it would be enough.  She wasn't kidding!

The meat was amazing.  The dips (hot sauce, bbq and ketchup) were great.  The fries were good (we ate all the fries!!).  Coleslaw was peppery and zesty.  We ate every bite and we do not often accomplish that feat.  So juicy and delicious!!"}
{"text":"These guys make one of my favourite burgers in the city, if not THE favourite. I've always got the pimento chili burger, I love that is it griddle smashed, adds a nice crispy layer, and I like that theres not much else on the burger besides the dressing and lettuce. Their fries are also really tasty. 

I still haven't tried the fried chicken here, but I had the bbq half chicken and thought that was really good too. Also still have to try the ribs. Not sure if these guys still do the veg of the day, but when they did have it that was usually good too... Usually it was collard greens. Very tasty."}
{"text":"They get a 0 stars for customer service. I absolutely hate when places like this get ahead of themselves just because they get a bit of TV shine. The curse of Guy Fieri strikes again. Only in Toronto would, what should be, a simple authentic BBQ joint lose its ability to be personable.  

You fleckin' tell me you're sold out of ribs at 5:30pm on a Sunday that I called. I asked if you take orders over the phone and what's the best way I can get some when you DO sell them? I'm told they certainly take phone orders. Okay....

So today I call at 4:45pm but as per the rules the Rib Nutzi's don't take orders at 4:30 for 8pm pick, I suppose they don't for 5:30pm pick ups either because they don't hold orders for longer than 20 minutes it seems according to \"the rules\" or excuse me FAQ's where which apparently THEY need a beer after because we ask too many questions. Maybe if you didn't introduce all these stupid douchey rules with your new found fame we wouldn't have all these questions. Well you need to get your head out of your ass! Like seriously writing a review when you're hungry after you've followed the rules and called EXACTLY AT 5pm! with no answer, then calls that went straight to voicemail which tells me you're actually answering is like dealing with an angry girlfriend if I ever had one. Get a grip and stop acting like an uppity biotch. Swiss Chalet here I come, you still lost $ tho. Shame."}
{"text":"This may be the best fried chicken I've ever had! and maybe the friendliest staff I've ever encountered too!!

This certainly isn't a place to go if you're a health nut but if you're after some excellent BBQ then I highly recommend Stockyards. We shared the fried chicken dinner and brisket sandwich & both were incredible. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly & one of the chefs topped up our fries because he'd just made a fresh batch and he said they'd be better- so nice!! The original fries we had were still delicious!

It's a really casual atmosphere & feels like a favorite neighborhood local because almost every staff member popped their heads over to see how we were doing and have a chat. It's a small venue so time your visit we'll but definitely a must do for st Clair west."}
{"text":"Finally!...a great BBQ spot in Toronto...after hitting the Green Barn Farmers' Market last Saturday morning, we arrived at The Stockyards right as they opened. We (my wife and I) had the porchetta and brisket sandwiches with a side of coleslaw. We both though that it was impeccable, perfectly juicy meats with appropriate sauces, beautifully  fresh baguettes that were the perfect compliment to the meaty goodness. The slaw was also very good, I can't see being able to eat an order of fries with a sandwich though, we were completely stuffed after the meal. They also said that they are starting brunch, and had hash with deep fried poached eggs that day...interesting...I will definitely be making the trip back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I have gone to stockyards multiple times now and it has good food and decent service. I went today for Sunday brunch however and received such bad service that I will never go back. I was on the wait list for quite some time now and was finally going to be next. There were two tables leaving and they had cleaned the one close to the door first. I told the lady working I wanted to sit closer in. This is because it's very cold near the front and I prefer to be warm while I eat. The other table was empty for over 10 minutes, cleared, and just needed to be set. I ask the manager with glasses and black curly hair how much longer and she replied rudely one second okay? Another 5 minutes have passed and she finally sets the tables. It's a long row of tables that can fit many people. She calls the person after me to go sit first then calls me and then tells me \"you can go sit, I suppose.\" It was so incredibly rude. I sit down upset and the  worker that I told I wanted to sit further away from the door comes to tell us to move down more for other people. We move down more and she asks me if I was upset because I passed up the first table and waiting longer was our choice. And we had no reason to be upset. Instead of figuring out why I was upset, knew I was upset and concluded that I had no reason to be upset. Yes, I chose to wait a little longer but their incompetence to clean up tables 15 minutes after they leave is ridiculous. And what kind of service is it to tell your customers they have no reason to be upset? Giving attitude and calling tables after me to sit first and telling me I can sit, I suppose? This ruined my experience here for life. I will never come back to a place with such unprofessional people. It doesn't matter if you have good food if you do not have good customer service. I've seen these workers multiple times here and they have always been nice. Today, they acted like they have never been educated in hospitality. I have recommended this place to many people and I will now NEVER recommend this place to anyone ever again. I will actually recommend people not to eat here."}
{"text":"Love The Stockyards.  Southern Fried Chicken is so yummy and messy; Ribs are finger sucking good, Fish tacos are light and delish, sides are always in season and tasty.  Great homemade lemonades. Next time I'm trying one of their burgers.  Only crappy thing about this place is the wait - but hey, it's worth the wait. Hopefully one day they will move to a bigger space.  I love to sit at the counter and watch the magic being made..."}
{"text":"Worst 4 star yelp rating restaurant I've ever been to! 

186 reviews 4 star average, BlogTo's 2nd top BBQ restaurant despite having bad seating and small location, this is a sure bet if there was ever one.

Have been looking for the opportunity to go, it's out of the way but it's worth it for food this good right? Finally after a couple of months of planning we actually went today. Traffic going there was horrific but it's worth it for food this good right?

We finally got there and parked across the street in the Macdonalds parking lot because the seating is not good so we would only sit down for a bit. As we entered it was like chaos, people standing all over the place not knowing what was what. We asked the people standing against the wall and they don't know what was going on. We asked the people in front of us and they are just as confused despite being there for a while and as people entered behind us they asked where's the line to sit down. 

It was finally our turn and as I ordered take out the door kept on opening and cold wind was blowing it. Not a good experience. To our surprised she said 25 minutes total came to over $45 for two. I was surprised how expensive it was and the bad experience standing there and ordering. But it's worth it for food this good right?

We went to Macdonalds to sit and wait with a Oreos McFlurry and they great fries. I went over to grab the food after 20 mins and was surprise the food was there waiting, how long has it been. We took it back to MacDonalds to eat.

I had the first bite of the ribs and it was lukewarm at most and very dried. My friend took a bite and said to return it. He had the beef brisket sandwich and thought it was okay. We both had the fries and it was so bad, we both concluded it was not ediable. Then I had the chicken, he thought it was good but the pieces I had was dried but we both agree that Popeye's chicken was way better.

A very disappointing experience. With the high prices and back experience and decent food, don't really know why they get so much business and are able to charge so much. I suspect that all the others were fooled into going there same as us, this makes sense as all the people ordering were newbies and not know what was going on. 

As we were leaving Macdonald's we spoke to a couple who were locals and said they frequent Stockyards often but thought their prices were high. They said smoke chicken sandwich is good, said the ribs are on and off and not sure why, and never get the pull pork, it's horrible.

We did end up returning the ribs to get our money back. They offered us credit, but why? We would not be coming back. Not worth it for food this bad right?

{"text":"Alright, I'll admit it. I'm a whore for hamburgers.
With that in mind, I checked out Stockyards, as one of the first eateries in my attempt to explore the city.

When my girlfriend and I walked in, I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a tad crowded (early evening on a weekday), and we weren't even sure if we'd get to sit. Luckily, somebody finished and left fairly quick. Score!

Another thing is that there's probably more flash in the worst fast food joint you can think of. This place is pretty much just countertop and stools. I'm not one to get all wet based on atmosphere, but I suppose it bears mentioning.

That's the only negative you'll find in this review. The ladies serving were probably the nicest and funniest servers I've ever had. Not invasive at all, and never failed to pop up as soon as you needed them.

My girl had the grilled cheese with mushrooms, and I had the burger (natch!). Hands down, the best burger I've ever had in my life. My hat goes off to the cooks. The fries were probably the best I've ever had as well. The only problem was that once my girl sampled my burger, and I sampled the grilled cheese, it was a debate-and-a-half for both of us, as to whether or not to give the food back to the other! Amazing grilled cheese!

I'm so surprised I haven't made time to go back yet, but I definitely will! The only reason why I didn't 5-star this is because I could imagine the crowding to be a problem on busier days/weekends. 

Seriously, eat there, and enjoy the Burgasm that you'll be having."}
{"text":"I went in last Sunday to pick up some chicken for an impromptu father's day picnic.  It was hot, greasy and packed inside. I think I liked the chicken better this time; the flavour was good and the chicken was very moist-- especially when I put some of the hot sauce on it-- but the sauce tasted like Frank's Red Hot and Tabasco mixed together.

I would give them a 3, but the cooks need to remember that it's an open kitchen. The guy who had just started his shift was yelling at the cashier/server and seemed very irate that I had come to pick up my 10 pcs of chicken to go-- even though I had ordered it 45 minutes before via a phone call. It's kind of shitty to hear out loud that someone is pissed off to have to make your order. 

The server tried her best to quell his bad mood--even calling him 'grumpy pants', but IMO he was being a dick. People don't want to hear your rant when they're eating. And I get that we all have shitty days, but take it to the walk in and scream there.  This guy was definitely grumpy pants and call me crazy-- but in addition to customer service, I always feel that if the person cooking my food is in THAT bad of a mood, that at least a shred of his shitty mood is being cooked into the food I'm going to eat.  I don't like to eat shit.

If it hadn't been for the server doing some patchwork between customer and cook, I might have walked out."}
{"text":"Yo! Do I have your attention? Yes? Focus, make some time, and get down to this spot asap.

My first thought leaving this place was: damn, I'm full. My second thought was: wow, that was such a great experience, I need to go on Yelp & share my opinion with the masses.

I'll properly contextualize: this place comes highly recommended and you can see why. There's minimal seating so it's hard to find a spot. We managed to come by early into lunch, and snag the seats in the window. As we ate, the place quickly filled up, and the phone continually rang off the hook with takeout orders.

The service was beyond thoughtful. I was wary coming into such a popular place; sometimes, you get that indifference that comes with hype. The server had noted my partner was eyeing the biscuits in the display case, and brought one over for free. Who does that these days? 

I ordered the 4 piece chicken & waffles, and he got the chicken dinner. I also ordered the mint iced tea (delicious) to wash it all down. Our mini jars of coleslaw were refilled once, and we received ketchup and hot sauce as sides.

My chicken & waffles was delicious. The sauce was tangy with equal notes of sweet and sour. I've heard of other places drizzling in sugary sweet stuff, not this place. The sauce filled my waffle just enough for it to remain crispy.

Now, let's get down to the business of the chicken. The skin was perfectly crispy, to the point where you could hear the crack when you broke it. The inside was gleaming with moist juices, and perfectly white. 

On top of that, everything was replenished throughout and the server remained upbeat and bubbly. We'll be back."}
{"text":"How I have longed for a place that not only had chicken and waffles but who can actually make it taste as good as it sounds! Well look no further stockyards is the ish!!! Their friendly service and atmosphere just makes you want to order! And trust me you will not be disappointed! So far I am in love with the fried chicken
 and waffles, I still want to try the pull pork sandwich so I'll be back there this Saturday :-)"}
{"text":"- big portions
- pretty good fried chicken and waffles
- not good for big groups

The portions are huge and everything is made really nicely. The fried chicken was fried perfectly. 

A friend and I went for lunch on a Friday and ordered the four-piece fried chicken and waffles ($16) and the Stockyards fried chicken dinner ($15) that pretty just replaces the waffles with a huge pile of fries. 

Four-pieces is half a chicken and it's plenty. I would say the chicken dinner is better value given how many fries they give you.  

The waffles weren't great. Coincidentally, the most recent MasterChef US elimination challenge was to recreate southern fried chicken and fries. The eliminated contestant made soft waffles with not enough colour. That was the case with my waffles as well as every other waffle I saw being made during my time there. The waffle was just too soft.

The \"syrup\", which is a chili maple molasses citrus glaze tasted mostly like hot sauce. You don't get much of the maple, molasses, or citrus. I prefer a more sweet normal-tasting syrup to go with my waffles and fried chicken, so this didn't hit the spot for me. It was almost a little weird. 

While I still enjoyed the waffles and accepted the sauce, they both could have been much better.

Stockyards is small, so it's not good for large groups. They can only fit about 6 people in a row on the bar (they have two bar benches) and a few seats near the entrance where you wouldn't get much privacy, especially if there's a rush for ordering and people paying their bills. 

There are a few restaurants where I've had better chicken and waffles (Harlem, Inspire) but I would come back if I was in the area because the food was really good."}
{"text":"My idea of a perfect date is eating some seriously delicious fried chicken!  I've had The Stockyards on my bookmark list forever and was finally able to make it to the west side to get me some fried chicken.  Let me tell you it did not disappoint.  I got the chicken dinner which consisted of 4 pieces of chicken, french fries and coleslaw.  This stuff is sooooo good!  I don't normally like white meal bc it's dry but the white meat here is JUICY!!!!  If you love fried chicken you need to get yourself over here!  The place is pretty small so I would suggest coming at off-peak hours and parking can be a headache as it's street parking only."}
{"text":"The beast burger (single patty) is absolutely amazing. I couldn't help but feel blessed as I ate it. If you want a delicious burger, this is your place."}
{"text":"We like to find hidden gems when we travel. Its tough to impress us, but Stockyards did just that. We took a $20 cab ride to try the Stockyards burgers and chicken. Unfortunately no ribs the day we were there. We sat at the bar and watched the show as John called out orders, Chris and Hassan filled um all. We loved that alone. Then the food arrived and it was insanely delicious. My son had a bacon cheeseburger and said it was the best burger hes ever eaten and after tasting it I couldn't believe we found a better burger in Toronto than anywhere in the tri-state area. My husband had the green chili pimento burger with bacon that was probably the best burger I've ever had. I chose the Fried chicken which was outrageous. They pile on the fries which like everything else was made fresh on site. Add the interesting ginger iced tea and you have a perfect meal. Service was quick fun and friendly. I'd come back to a Toronto just for this place and those burgers."}
{"text":"I am  a regular at the stockyards simply because I haven't had anything that I didn't like and want to try every item on the menu. 
So far I've had the porchetta sandwich (fantastic herbed taste), the pulled pork and chicken sandwich (deliciously rich bbq sauce - the pork is better than the chicken), the burger (my favourite in the city), the beef brisket (HUGE and definitely one of my favourite items) and the ribs (I couldn't get through the half rack order).
Now they have a brunch menu I need to work though. So far I had the smoked meat hash and the smothered biscuits.
I haven't seen smoked meat hash served anywhere in the city other than my mom's house. This was a great treat! It comes with two deep fried poached eggs. I was skeptical because I like how my mom serves her hash with an oozing sunny-side egg on top; but this works because they leave just enough runny egg yolk in their poached egg to seep into the hash to make it perfect!
As for the biscuits with house sage sausage gravy, I was surprised at the strong sage taste. I was expecting a darker gravy but the menu does spell out that its a \"sage\" gravy. I suppose I still expected a dark gravy. The sage sauce is still good but I wonder if it could be better.
The biscuits alone are worth the brunch with a side of the lemony butter and fruit jam (I doubt its called a jam because whatever that fruity goodness is in the cup its wildly good).
Can you believe I haven't tried the fried chicken yet? I've never had the patience because it takes 20minutes to make (fresh per order).
If you go - make sure you get the onion rings - just do it!"}
{"text":"Hungry - check
Had too much to drink last night - check
Need grease to kick start the day - check

I am still in love with this spot.  I want an I heart Stockyards t-shirt.

I treated myself this am to the Stockyards brunch.  Trip #2 of my goal to try everything on Stockyards menu.  Again - I was not disappointed.

I had the beignets (dulce de leche), French press coffee, and The Stockyards sandwich.

As some of you know I love donuts and am always looking for some authentic deep fried goodness.  When the waitress brought me my beignet, there was a hush over the restaurant and people stared.  I am also sure they heard me say \"OH MY GOD\" with every biteful.

The Stockyards sandwich is a artery stopping combo of a deep fried poached egg and Stockyards bacon on a biscuit.  Again, I am sure everyone heard me say \"OH MY GOD\" with every biteful of this buttery pork bundle.

Now, I must say, when I eat, I typically do not finish what is front of me and I typically eat quite slow.  Today was an exception.  I stuffed my face at a pace that surprised myself and I ate all of it.

I must make special kudos to the staff.  I love all the staff here - so friendly.  I love the special touches - giving recommendations, remembering your name, checking in on you often, etc.  They are truly the frosting on the Stockyards cake.

I am also so pleased at the quality to price ratio.  For the beignets, coffee and sandwich, it was less than $15.  I would honestly pay well over $20 for the quality."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was not disappointed. 

 We ordered takeout because it was pretty busy and the seating was pretty limited.   While we were there an order was taken to a customer incorrectly and the situation was handled nicely with a little comedic relief.   I ordered the brisket sandwich and my girlfriend had the chicken.  The brisket was good but I was not a huge fan of the bbq sauce they used.  However, I heard the chicken was fantastic.   Overall, I was very pleased and will be returning."}
{"text":"Fried chicken done right. i have a few places i want to hit up when im back in toronto and Stockyards is definitely high up in the list"}
{"text":"I tried this place last weekend, and man, I couldn't taste the meat at all - everything was covered up with their special sauce, which was too vinegary. I enjoy meat, for that price I could've got a great peace of steak.
Their fries were over cooked, tasted like the oil from the deep fryer.
So the verdict: meat - tasteless; fries - tasteless.
Honestly can't understand why this is top 5 in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Incorporating all the elements I love in a restaurant - fast, tasty, and cheap - this place is as good as everyone says. 

We tried the cheddar pimento burger and pulled pork sandwich. The burger was cooked to perfection and the quality of the meat was impressive. It was relatively small, however. I'd try the mammoth burger next time which features 2 of their delicious patties. The pulled pork was massive and the meat was tender but the sauce was a little too sweet for my liking. Oh yeah, and the fries were amaaaazing! 

The place is not quite full service (you pay at the cash) but my drink never ran empty and my plates were cleared instantly. The team service was appreciated. 

I don't need to recommend this place judging by the plethora of good reviews, but I give it my stamp of approval."}
{"text":"Went here for my Birthday a couple weeks ago and I couldn't be happier with how dinner turned out. We were a group of five and decided to try a bit of everything. We got fried chicken dinners, ribs, butter burger and the spicy chili burger. EVERYTHING was sooo delicious! The butter burger was a little rich so I was glad to be sharing,but man was it good! Fried chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy outside,juicy and tender inside.I haven't been able to get it out of my head! 
It was very rammed but service was still really good and I loved the chaotic, fast paced atmosphere!"}
{"text":"GEEEEEZE this place is so freakin' delicious. 
It's a bit pricey and no fault of their own because they are amazing but the line is insane at any time of year for sunday brunch. 
That being said the fried chicken and waffles is enough to turn a vegetarian (me) into a carnivore :)"}
{"text":"...amazing place! we rushed to this place and walked in at 845pm thinking there's no way they'd want to serve us 15 minutes before their closing time. to our surprise, it was still packed with people dining in and taking out. our waitress gladly seated us, was incredibly friendly, and that alone already impressed me. 

we ordered:
stockyards fried chicken dinner, excellent.
half rack pork ribs, excellent, only available tues, fri, and sun. 
mexican street corn, excellent. 

the portions were all massive and the prices are totally awesome. i'd definitely go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I came here because of all the rave reviews because I am a follower. The place is tiny and usually packed so get your food to go if you can, and be prepared to wait.
 The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about but it was a decent meal. I had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was delicious, the portions were generous. Its kinda cool that you get to see the chefs cooking right in front of you and theres the added bonus of peace of mind over the *ahem* purity of the food... What!? Havent you seen \"Waiting\"?, im not crazy. All in all, it was a good meal, the chili syrup was pretty original and the homemade coleslaw was cool. Drop by if you can but get that ish to go."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious homemade food. Cali inspired BBQ at it's finest, my animal burger was missing the tomato other than that and the price are my only complaints. The buttermilk chicken is amazing some of the best deep fried chicken I've had(popeyes has nothing on this place). Few bucks cheaper and it'd get 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place was ok. The one thing I loved was their green chilli pimento cheese burger- holy that was amazing

Now you might ask why I would only give this place three stars. Well their service requires some definite upgrades. They were quite brusque in the way they were speaking to customers who had arrived after their 2:30 deadline for seating. I'd just like to say when I called and checked their site it said they served brunch until 3pm but when you go in they say it's 2:45pm. If they're going to stop seating 15 minutes prior to their close then they should stop at 2:45. When I showed up there were four available tables for two, and they said they were full... Odd

Anyhow overall the chefs know what they're doing here- the food is awesome. But and this is a big but, their front of house needs some serious improvements."}
{"text":"I have always raved about absolutely everything I've ever had here (just ask any of my foodie friends or family), and I've eaten in and done takeout from here for years.  But on my most recent trip here with my son, after we polished off most of a double burger and fried chicken dinner, we took home a whole rack of ribs and I have to say that they were not as good as before...

I've occasionally had slow service, but I've excused that because of the food--I mean, EVERYTHING was so damn good! Their fried chicken is still probably the best I've had in the city... The burgers are still up there with the best, as well... Their smoked chicken is THE best in the city... Their pulled pork sammie... Their chicken and waffles, even their biscuits...

But their ribs, they used to be soo juicy, so meaty, so fall-off-the-bone delicious, that we would order extra...  These did not live up to the past...  What gives???  I WILL go back to give them another chance!"}
{"text":"Some would say this place is overrated but c'mon! It's certainly worth a try. I've had their breakfasts and burgers didn't regret it. Be prepared to wait as it's always packed!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken dinner that I have had in TO.  It is crispy, satisfying and tender inside.  It is cooked well so you do not miss any nuance of the deep fried experience.  The biscuits and gravy is wonderful as well reminding you of a big Southern hug in a plate.  I was really lucky to find seating at the end of the bar so when I fell of my chair from the gustatory delights I did not bring anyone down with me.  I saved the pulled pork for a next time.  One can only indulge in so much for one day, right?"}
{"text":"A lil hole in the wall in the trendy St Clair area of town. Some of the best fried chicken that i have ever eaten. Their burgers are juicy and melt of the top softness. Be prepared to be standing outside waiting for your order as the place is tiny. Next purchase is going to the ribs. Looks amazing!!"}
{"text":"The Verdict: I'd go back! Awesome fries and chicken was juicy.

The great: the fries were thin, fresh and crispy, and the chicken was fried perfectly, even the white meat was succulent.

The good: simple menu with a good selection. Everything looks great and they have a friendly staff.

The bad: The pulled pork was \"meh\". Some of my friends like it, maybe I've just had realllly good pulled pork in my life and have become a snob. Anyways, that's my opinion :)

The ugly: If you want to be seated, the wait is horrendous. Get takeout!

The full review:

Definitely not for the healthy eaters out there (hey, it' sa LARDery) but I recommend you check out this little (I mean, little) on your cheat days. They have some of the best fries I've had in Toronto, thin, fresh and crispy, and the friend chicken is cooked well.  It's not for those that love batter (it's rather light on batter) but the meat is juicy - even the white meat! 

I've had better pulled pork, so I would pass on that. Next time I'd try their beef brisket (looked great) and ribs (also looked good).  

It's a shame they got rid of their fish tacos though (it's still on the website, but they don't serve it anymore), I heard those were awesome.

But I warn you, plan ahead and get take out, and just eat somewhere else. My friends waited about 40 minutes to get a seat (I showed up casually late so didn't wait long)!

Only reason I deduct a star is because I've had better pulled pork, and the wait time is horrid."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday lunch and i have to say one of the best chicken and waffles ive had in the city! 

Its a small place not much seating. We got bar seating to watch the chef in action. 

The service here was great! 

Cant wait to come back again for another chicken and waffle meal"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries here are made fresh! You could see the chef hard at work preparing your meal. The portions are huge, the burgers are cooked perfectly, the fries are golden and the coleslaw was creamy and tasty. This is one of the best restaurants in the area so if you're around st. Clair around lunch, skip the fast food places and come here."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the street, but come in and you'll encounter a beautiful weathered-wood interior and a heavenly smell.  Not really for the vegetarian on your list, this upscale barbecue joint is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.

Most of their business seems to be takeout, though there's some very attractive counter seating.  Maybe right now it has something to do with the heat - the ovens and grills make a/c irrelevant.

Expect to pay $7 to $9 for a sandwich without sides - but what a sandwich.  I had the pulled pork.  The beautiful fraying hanks of pork shoulder were tender and juicy, flavoured with a sweet, smoky sauce.  

Going for the coleslaw as well was a mistake - it tasted strongly of cracked pepper and sugar, and didn't go well with the sweet  barbecue sauce on the pulled pork.

I got take-out, which means that the utilitarian (McDonaldsish) bun was partially soggy by the time I get home, but I was happy I was able to balance the intense smokey sweetness with a well-balanced dark beer.  No liquor license at the Stockyards - just homemade lemonade and upscale pops.  

I did have to hang around for a few minutes while the staff in the open kitchen avoided meeting my eye, and I wondered where I was supposed to order; I suppose they'll work that kink out soon."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday early evening for some fried chicken and ribs. All ribs were sold out at 6:30! (considering they start selling at 5pm, they sold out fast). 
The fried chicken was good except there was one piece out of four that was really salty. The frites that came with chicken were so-so and soggy.  
I'd like to come back to try the ribs."}
{"text":"If u like chicken and waffles or biscuits and gravy u MUST come it was delicious ; BRUNCH..get BRUNCH!

It's a pretty busy place, but if you are willing to wait you'll be fine ;)"}
{"text":"Very tasty, very fatty comfort food. If that's what  you are looking for then look no further.  The pulled pork sandwich and buttered burger are divine.  The pork seems legitimately slow roasted and is succulent, it also seems that some of it is cut so you get some chunky pieces in with the shreds. The butter burger is epic delectable. With bone marrow,  cheese and butter,  this rich sandwich is very greasy and for the very hungry. Food aside, the joint is small and can get cramped during the rush of lunch.  All seating is on bar stools and can be uncomfortable for some."}
{"text":"I never was a huge fan of fried chicken before, but after stealing some of my boyfriend's chicken and waffles dish.. I'm a more-than-satisfied fan. The chicken was deliciously juicy and fried to perfection. The meat seemed to just glide off the bone! And finally, the sweet chilli sauce that glazed over the chicken and waffle really tied the whole dish together.

I ordered one of their special burgers for my lunch (forgot the name but it was $11 and they serve only a limited number of these per day). It wasn't as life-changing as their chicken, but it was definitely one of the best burgers I've had.

The location is pretty hole-in-the-wall and not extremely close to the downtown core, but it's not too bad a walk from the St. Clair subway station. I would definitely make the trip down again."}
{"text":"The place is tiny but well organized which is a key considering how many people want to get in! Butter buns are delicious!
Everything is cooked in front of your eyes, the servers are fast and friendly - great place either for brunch or dinner. Also take out is a good option on a busy night!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one Saturday. The wait was excruciatingly long....but worth it. We had chicken and waffles, and they were perfect.. I'm not looking forward to waiting in line for so long anytime soon, but I'd come back, sure.

The restaurant is really small and consists of two long bars with chairs. As another poster already mentioned, it's worth the tight squeeze."}
{"text":"Oh Lord of Meats, King of Protein
Why dost thou mock me?  
What hath I done to deserve such displeasure?
With profound sadness I must remove'th a treasured star from thyne stockyard.

After my review I was in much need of oh so glorious meat that I returned back to the stockyard at yester eve
The fried chicken I've heard much about was what I desired
I was happily greeted and quickly seated with service like my prior
Alas my meal, my expectations, it did not achieve

A cardinal sin they did approve
Using old stale oil to fry pieces of the hoof
My chicken and fries were over done
The batter tasted that of none!
The coleslaw tasted not of my appeal
Though the greenery of which was real

When it came time for me to leave
A server I could not find to help my heave
I waited patiently for 5 minutes or more
Until I got restless and got on the floor

I left my stuff and lined up to pay
And when I returned 'twas to my dismay
Mine fries and chicken pieces I had left to take, to go
The server had swooped in, took it and left me with nothing,  no 'mo

So half a meal was all I had
That was what which made me very mad
With great regret that this much I must do
With a flicker a star goes vamoosh"}
{"text":"Sometimes I dream about this place. Mainly because I used to live in Texas and this is the closest I've gotten to many of my lard-core favourites."}
{"text":"My out of town cousin was up for a visit so I wanted to take her to a place my wife likes called Emma's just down the street from the Stockyards.  Unfortunately Emma's was closed due to renovations for about a week so since we made the trek all the way from the west end to St. Clair and Oakwood I wanted to find a place to have a nice breakfast/brunch.  

For so long I've had the Stockyards on my bookmarks list.  I've had friends tell me that I'd like the place because of their fried chicken and I for some reason I never put it together that they were open early enough for breakfast/brunch.  Either way it was a short walk over and I was looking forward to it since I've heard so many good things.

The Stockyards is a small footprint.  The seating is basically along the wall, along the front window or at the main counter all stool and bar style.  There's no tables here and the cooking is pretty much done right in front of you as that's the kitchen as well.  It was my first time here so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as the menu but upon entering there is a display of biscuits behind glass to be oohed and awed on.  You see my wife had to work this weekday morning but she loves biscuits.  It's one of the reasons she likes Emma's and since McD's no longer carry biscuits here it's not very easy to find them here in Toronto.  Biscuits are more of a \"southern\" thing.  The USA has them everywhere right?  I mean you can't go to a place that serves breakfast and not find biscuits.  It's like going to a place that serves breakfast that doesn't serve coffee... in the south, it's unheard of really.

The menu seemed pretty simple and uncomplicated but I knew I was going to order the chicken and waffles.  The question was I going to order it with 2 pieces or 4?  My cousin ended up going witht the breakfast sandwich which included a deep fried poached egg (Scotch egg?) as well as her choice of sausage or bacon.  I ended up ordering a side of bacon too because well not only do I love fried chicken but I also love bacon.  Oh my, the bacon served here is so thick!  It's like half a centimeter thick!  So good... it's not like any packaged bacon you'll buy at any grocery store.  

So of course I'm all about the supersize so I end up ordering the 4 piece.  I didn't even ask what the chicken pieces were going to be because somewhere deep down I assumed it was going to be all dark meat.  Don't get me wrong I like dark meat but I also like white meat.  I'm used to seeing places mostly or exclusively use dark meat for the reason that it's more affordable but also it's typically not as dry as white meat but it's also not as large as white meat pieces either.  Well wasn't it my surprise when the 4 pieces of chicken were served that it was essentially an entire half chicken?  By half I mean breast half, rib and wing half, thigh and drum.  That's 4 pieces, or half a chicken.  Not the dark half or white half but both the dark quarter and the white quarter.  Being that these pieces were a mix it was a LOT of meat and it was more than I was expecting.  

The waffle which was freshly made to order was drizzled sparingly (thank you) but let's be honest, the waffle is a compliment to the golden fried chicken which is the feature and reason I ordered what I ordered in the first place.  Wow this fried chicken was amazing.  I mean as far as fried chicken goes it ranks right up there with some the best I've ever had anywhere.  Freshly made and served so it's hot, properly cooked though and though as well as juicy and tasty.  I left nothing on the plate except the bones as it was an absolute pleasure to experience the Stockyard's fried chicken.  

Going back to the biscuits, my wife loves them as I said so as far as a to go item I ended up ordering 2 biscuits to bring home so she could have them later in the day.  She told me afterwards that she thought the biscuits were in fact better than Emma's.  That's saying a lot.  She knows and loves her biscuits like I love my fried chicken.  I forgot to mention that The Stockyards has on their menu \"sausage gravy\" in that they're usually served together with biscuits aka \"biscuits and gravy\".  That's totally a southern thing and quite honestly it's the first time I've EVER seen that here in Toronto.  We just don't have that kind of love for biscuits up here like they do down there and white gravy aka sausage gravy?  No, we don't have that item popularized up here at all.  As far as I was concerned until I saw that The Stockyards had it on their menu, I didn't think it existed up here at all.

While I like Emma's I can say that I was happy to discover The Stockyards that day.  Their food is great and now my wife wants to try it out as well.  She really missed out that day but she'll get to go soon enough."}
{"text":"I finally made it to The Stockyards! That knocks my list of must-try restaurants to about 300?

We arrived around quarter to six and the place was busier than usual because of Grid TO's Burger Week. While you don't have to arrive a whole hour early, you will want to arrive well before six if you want to nab a spot in this cozy joint.  It is bar top seating only, with no more than room for 25.

The menu is simple: burgers, ribs or chicken.  Unfortunately, the ribs and smoke chicken only make appearances on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays - so mark it down on your calendars.

We opted for the 16 oz. Iced Tea ($2) and Limemade ($3.25) which could almost pass for Mojito - almost.  Both were light and refreshing.

The Fried Chicken Dinner ($14) is sufficient enough for 2, though you may not want to share.  In essence, a half-chicken coated in buttermilk with a side of fresh slaw and a mountainous mass of shoestring fries - you won't leave here feeling hungry.  Tabasco and ketchup are provided for those of you who like to eat your food like Dunkaroos.

We also opted to share the Butter Burger ($9) adorned with bone marrow, blue cheese red wine butter, onion frites, and butter lettuce.  When I bit in to the burger, I couldn't help but think of the \"Pissing Beef Balls\" scene in God of Cookery starring Stephen Chow.  (If you don't get the reference, click here and pay attention at 7:09).  It was mouthwatering - all credited to the inclusion of bone marrow no doubt.  The burgers here are griddle-smashed and Dempster's buns are used.  Keep it simple stupid.

V E R D I C T

While the fried chicken dinner came with plenty of sides, the burger seemed a bit lonely making its solo appearance.  Skillets are used as serving implements which can take up quite a lot of table space if you start ramping up the number of dishes you're ordering.

I highly recommend you try the fried chicken here as every piece (yes, even the white meat) is tender.  It's better than finger lickin' good!  The shoestring fries will have you reaching into a void only to wonder how you possibly could've eaten the entire serving.  The one thing I did miss though, was an ice cold beer!  That would've made my experience truly complete."}
{"text":"Traditional place in Toronto with great food. The only downside is that is always packed, so be patient. Pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw, my favourite!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for an alright price!

Only complaint, parking..."}
{"text":"Damn, this is a place worth the trip. It fails getting 5 stars because the service can be a little lacking but it's easily forgiven once you get your food.

The star is of course the pulled pork sammy. Slowly smoked pork shoulder until the meat can be shredded with a fork is mixed with a vinegary South Carolina style BBQ sauce then piled on a cheap bun and topped with coleslaw. It's a party in your mouth and everybody is invited.

This is a serious sandwich and you shouldn't go there unless you're hungry. I also suggest the homemade limeade with mint. It's refreshing and pairs well with the food.

Although I haven't tried it I've heard good things about the fried chicken, the ribs and the burger which I plan on having the next time I'm up there."}
{"text":"A very heavy, yet worthy, brunch experience.

I have only heard about how good their smoked meats are until I went to experience it on my own.  The place is tiny, lined with up bar stools and chairs.  But the food speaks for itself.

FRIED CHICKEN AND WAFFLES - this was sooo amazing.  It was fried chicked deep fried in perfection, placed on a bed of waffles.  Sprinkled over a tangy hot and sweet sauce that blended the flavours together magically.  The sauce is an acquired taste - if you don't like something so spicy in the AM or with your brunch, the get it on the side, but it was very Southern and very delicious!

THE BISCUITS AND SAUSAGE GRAVY was very rich and a very sizeable meal.  It came with a side of eggs too.  The gravy tasted a bit like mushroom soup, but the meal all together had a great taste.  Nothing super special or different but it was delicious.  

Both the meals very large portions, if 2 adults shared one main brunch item, it may be enough.  The Coffee and fresh squeezed OJ are delicious.

I would recommend, in fact, I would like to go there again myself for dinner or take out.  The smoked meats seems Southernly divine."}
{"text":"My love for eating out and discovering new food establishments comes with its share of lifestyle adjustments. For instance, skinny jeans on most outings are eschewed in favour of the more ahem, form flattering yoga pants or sweatpants. And any calorie laden meal means an extra 20 minutes or so spent on the treadmill as penance! Which brings me to my latest discovery- The Stockyards, a bbq joint at St. Clair and Christie that combines two of my favourite things: carnal meat and smoke. This place is dangerous folks, they do barbeque and they do it well.

I've tried a few items from the Stockyards and all have been deliciously satisfying and worth the extended trip north of bloor. The fried chicken is juicy and tender throughout and covered in superb, spiced crust. It's definitely a contender for best fried chicken in the city!At $12, it's also nicely priced as you get 4 hunky pieces with a whack of fries and some coleslaw. Fries are thin-cut and double fried however if you're getting take out careful as these tend to be rendered into soggy bits from the condensation in the containers. Ribs are not a regular menu item, they are only featured on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays but if you're lucky to catch them they are worth a bite. My roommate and I shared a half rack ($13) and we both agreed that the pieces come tastefully lacquered with the right ratio of flesh and fat. The tangy bbq sauce on the side also serves as a nice counterpoint to the rich spice rub on dem bones. In the sides department there are sweet and toothy pit beans with bits of rib ends studded in. Coleslaw is both creamy and tart but doused in too much sauce. 

This is mostly a take-out operation as there's a limited number of stools inside for seating. Further the hours are rather short-9 on weeknights and 8 on weekends. Drinks are limited to the non-alcoholic variety but their homemade ice-teas and mint infused limeades do a decent job of cutting through the inherent bbq heaviness.

Sevice is at once cheery and sassy, the manager notes during one of my visits that I've been too engaged in my order ribs to take off my coat. Ha! She's right, when you find something this good and exciting to devour everything else becomes a blur."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken, green beans and a Beast burger at the Stockyards.  Wonderful. Wish they had a restaurant in east end of Toronto."}
{"text":"Finally glad to knock this one off my list, thou I didnt have the chicken like they seem to be famed for. I had a burger and it was good from a place that specialize in chicken, you know you have winner if they excel else where too

I had the Dirty Thirsty,  sound like something that should be coated it beer like like onion.... (I dont know what they are called) but they were good. And we had a good stuffed cheese patty burger, it was melted and gooey it was good good, the meat was juicy cook right, medium well is above what I usually have it but I left it to them and it was good choice, good burger from the meat to the toppings, definitely have to be back for the chicken"}
{"text":"Gluttony. Actually, it's not that bad, but big portions, and I would suggest only coming here on a very empty stomach.

Arriving around 12:30pm on a weekday, it was full. It's small, with some bar seating, so don't expect to hang around too long. They didn't want to seat me until my friend showed up, but I had a comfortable bench to wait at. 

There's one cook and one server working there. The server loves to chat. A little annoying that she chats so much that usually there was a long line up waiting to pay at the front - I don't like it when efficient service is sacrificed by friendliness. But no one else seemed to mind. 

We had the infamous fried chicken. Tasty and moist, even the chicken breast was not bad. It wasn't greasy as the conventional, but couldn't have been healthy either. I agree with Edwin A. that it wasn't as flavourful as I would have expected it to be. I think Popeyes has more spices. Even the fries were meh.

We also shared a beef brisket sandwich. It was tasty, but nothing special either. 
Both were huge potions - the chicken, 4 pcs with lots of fries and coleslaw - the sandwich basically 12inches. We were full up, but I could have just lived with sharing just the chicken, for example. 

Meh. Not sure if I'll be back, only if in the area."}
{"text":"The beast is the best burger in the city. Consistently excellent. I prefer to go single style and sometimes my wife & I split 3 for 2. I usually go for pickup as I get too hungry waiting inside. The staff is always friendly and chatty and food is ready quickly after ordering. Fries are tasty and plentiful. Also have been for brunch a couple times and the sausage gravy is chronic. Tastes good but is a lot to handle. I have nothing but good things to say and I haven't even touched on the fried chicken, ribs, grilled cheese or whatever bacon-ized veggie of the day they are serving. Going tonight!"}
{"text":"That was some tender and flavorful chicken.

Found street parking. This place is busy, with lots of take out orders as well. There is some counter seating inside but it's a small space and it gets packed in here quick. It took some time for us to get seated. Service was friendly and attentive. Our food came out in a timely manner. Restrooms are in the back and clean enough. 

Everything was delicious from start to finish. Their Homemade Iced Tea w/ Ginger and Lemon was refreshing. The Stockyards Fried Chicken Dinner was perfect for sharing. Wow, was that chicken good! Super juicy and flavorful meat with a lovely crispy exterior. Added a little hot sauce on it and it was winner winner chicken dinner, lol. It comes with fries and coleslaw. The fries were well prepared. Initially we wanted to try their ribs, but it got sold out super quick. Decided to check out The Classic Burger and I'm so glad we did. It was amazing! The bun was so light, yet held everything together. The meat patty was juicy and flavorful. I appreciate that the burger wasn't greasy or heavy. All in all, we had an excellent meal here. 

Oh yea, and Guy Fieri was here :D"}
{"text":"\"Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong wit you. You supposed to eat that thing not scalp it.\".. 

\"Well Daddy, all the calories in the chicken are found in the skin...\"

\"Whatchu talking about where all the fats and calories is..You know where that comes from, that damn TV...Every time you turn it on you have someone talking about loosing weight, get healthy...\"

-Nutty Professor - Dinner Scene

At Stockyards, the biggest mistake would be 'scalping' your buttermilk fried chicken! mmmmm....mmmmm....mmmmm. Served in a skillet with (AWESOME) shoe string fries, the four pieces of perfectly battered, golden fried chicken are a soul pleasing, belly bursting favourite! I have never had a batter like the one Stockyards serves up. It's sweet, tangy, salty with a kick of spice. My mouth is actually watering. You'll usually get two pieces of white and two pieces of dark meat. AND that side coleslaw - Perfect balance between the creamy and vinegary kind with a mean kick of pepper! Stockyards is usually great about substitutions. When I'm feeling a little on the \"unhealthy side\" I substitute my fries for whatever veg is on special. It's usually some type of collard green, asparagus, beans, kale or brussels sprout. BUT these aren't the kind your momma makes...they're covered in butter and simmering from the skillet!

Stockyards always has specials for the day or week but you'll be able to order your classics off their menu all the time: pulled pork, pulled chicken, RIBS (every Tues, Fri and Sunday), Classic or Smashed Burger, Trout Sandwich, BBQ Beef Brisket, Grilled Cheese (always some unusual and yummy interpretation). 

** If you ever see the Portobello Mushroom Burger on the chalk board menu, GET IT! It's in my list of the top best things that have hit my lips. Imagine this...large portobello mushroom, covered in aged cheddar cheese and deep fried to a perfect crisp. Put in between a buttery, white bun, a pesto mayo and some arugula thrown on top. I dare you to try and finish it!

I could go on and on about the food. There are so many choices and so much to rave about. Actually, only one complaint. The pulled chicken sandwich can be a little too wet. You need to eat it fast. I left it for 3 minutes and the bun was soppy wet. Made it very difficult to eat.

The Staff/Service and Place
They call themselves the modern family diner/BBQ joint! It definitely has the vibe of a family kitchen. The owner is usually somewhere around. Whether on the grill or chatting with his patrons. My first time there he came up to my boyfriend and I and asked us if we wanted to try his sweet/tangy syrup he just created. We were one of the first to try it! Now its used on the Chicken and Waffles for brunch. It's a non pretentious place with kick ass food and friendly staff who love their job! If the staff are happy, you know you're going to be happy. 
There are not many places to sit but don't be shy. Pull a stool up to the bar or beside someone else on the side. During the summer they have a bench in the front with a small table. We love eating out there.

I've basically written an essay but I think you get the point. You NEED to visit Stockyards. Try their fried chicken...and bring friends so you can mooch off their skillet too!"}
{"text":"Stockyards, Stockyards, Stockyards! On a whim we finally went to Stockyards! On the unseasonably warm Saturday in January, my boyfriend and I took a stroll from the Junction to St. Clair and finally decided to get this fried chicken everybody was raving about (he's from the South, he's very picky with his fried chicken) but let me tell you, it was worth the walk! (That and we probably burned some much needed calories for this meal...)

We were sat almost immediately by the front door and ordered the chicken dinner, some Boylands and two biscuits. Big mistake. ONE biscuit is enough for two people! These delicious balls of dough are softball sized and full of flaky, buttery goodness! The meal was definitely enough for two people and they topped us up with more fries than necessary (but I definitely appreciated it later that evening!) The chicken wasn't dry, but nice and moist and it tasted so incredibly good. I'm absolutely returning here some time for ribs, ribs, ribs!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in town. Love the brunch chicken and waffles. A bit crowded on space though and I'm not sure if takeout would be as good. But if you get to eat it fresh, it's amazing. My wife loves the BAT sandwich too."}
{"text":"From the Fried chicken and waffles, brisket, burgers all made fresh daily this is a must for any food lover!"}
{"text":"So.good. Don't let the line-ups scare you. I've seen it move real quick and take out isn't a bad idea. MY dish is 4 pies coleslaw and fries. Actually very good coleslaw. some places have gone off the reservation with theirs (I'm looking at you white brick Kitchen). Fast service and food is soo good here. Definitely the best fried chicken place in the GTA. I've had the predecessors and some contenders for the throne but this place still reigns above them all with very little question. There are others that may be more \"interesting\" (Dirty Bird) but Stockyards is still the best for taste."}
{"text":"Fried chicken marinated for 48 hours, with home made hot sauce, nuf said.

Butter burger, bun soaked and melted on meat, nuf said."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and fries were extremely salty and oily. Fries were not crunchy as other reviews have described. Chicken tasted ordinary. What a waste of time, money and effort to drive out of my way to try food that ended up in the garbage."}
{"text":"this is one pretty dope spot. ordered chicken and waffles! it was bumpin fam! crunchy,juicy,and just simply well done. ron swanson would be impressed! service was also fantastic,they were in the weeds but they crushed it. really friendly folks. definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.

I would frequent The Stockyards much more often if it weren't so damn far. Even so, the food is worth the trip. Go with one other friend and enjoy each others company in this stuffy little restaurant.

I did just that and let me tell you, it's a hustle and bustle little spot that doesn't disappoint. After our great dining experience at Bairrada Churrasqueira Grill last weekend, we decided to venture to another BBQ restaurant. This time, something along the lines of good ol' American BBQ goodness. Something charred, smoked and grilled. The Stockyards was the place to be.

After a 7 minute wait, we were seated right in front of the grilling station along the bar. There are only 3 seating sections in this shack and I lucked out by sitting in the best. The restaurant was run like any other restaurant, but it's a eyeopening experience when you're able to see them grill your food to perfection. It feels like you're part of your dinner (staring and drooling counts alright...) while you sit there waiting, mesmerized by the sounds of sizzling meets, toasting bread and frying chicken.

The menu is small and will appeal to anyone that isn't a vegetarian. Burgers, sandwiches, BBQ plates, fried chicken pretty much sums it up. Everything sounds good. Anything with bacon, pork cracklings or garlic aioli sounds good in my books. Lucky, that's almost everything on the menu.

There wasn't any Porchetta left, so I chose my second option: Smoked Beef Brisket sandwich. My friend ordered the Fried Chicken Dinner.
I'm telling you now, these portions are good and hearty. They come out served in cast iron pans. It was a nice touch to the presentation.

The brisket sandwich was really good, but make sure to ask for garlic aioli on the side to dip your sandwich and fries in. It's quite a slimming meal so, no worries.

The fried chicken came with 5 pieces of crispy battered, spiced and golden brown chicken. Cole slaw and fries are your sides. The chicken was tender, juicy and moist. The crispy skin was spiced just right and reminded me of...dare I say... KFC. Just slightly.

After our meals, we were full to the max. Got up, paid at cash and took a nap when we got home.

Verdict: Stockyards is one of my favourite restaurants. It provided quality food with unique twists done right. It was a lively and different environment with great service and reasonable prices for the portions. Go only if you like food..."}
{"text":"Great little place!  Visiting from the States and found it on Yelp. Excellent burgers and barbecue!  Staff and cooks were very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty decent fried chicken, bacon sandwich and spicy Brussels sprouts! However, not worth the wait (close to an hour) or the price, for mediocre service (they forgot part of our order and our drinks as well, but were nice about it when asked) with crammed seating and slightly better than ok food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger on the way home from work, it was really good, but the place is small, so I brought my burger to the streetcar stop in the middle of the road.
Same packed problem when I brought the girlfriend, we wound up sitting on the wall across the street at Mcdonald's lol

She had the chicken, it was great too, I stuck with the burger because I love it.

Great food, but don't go in the winter, you will never get a seat, and it is too cold to be outside.

I would go five stars, but the place needs to be bigger."}
{"text":"I don't really get it. Must be a hipster thing..
Ordered: chicken dinner, brisket sandwich, animal burger and half a rack of ribs to go. 
We got there around 4 on a Friday and it wasn't busy....yet...
After reading about how great the chicken is I had very high expectations... They weren't met.. It looked great but I found it to be very greasy and not a lot of meat for 4 pieces of chicken.. I expected more flavour and more crunch.. The fries were good not great.. 
The burger flavour reminded me of BP's but not as good umami.. Beef wasn't as good.. Still it was my favourite item we ordered. The brisket sandwich tasted good but I prefer thicker slices and more tender, it had a nice smoke flavour but it's not the best brisket in town.
Just ate the ribs and they were definitely not the best in TO as per Toronto Life. It was a sloppy rib, untrimmed and I felt VERY greasy, the sauce on the side was good though. 
All this and there wasn't a line which there usually is and there weren't people hovering over my shoulder while I was eating which there almost always is. Compound this with the pretty inaccessible location and we won't be returning.. Hey to each their own.... Enjoy the lines and the less than comfortable environment to chow in hipsters!"}
{"text":"Service: HORRIBLE!!! We almost left 3 times. 
We arrived and waited/were ignored for 15 mins. 
Then when we finally spoke up the hostess had a HUGE attitude.
But she didnt just stop there, once she seated us she lectured and patronized us. She even threatened us, telling us we should beware of what we say because the regulars have her back. When really we were patient and polite during the whole ordeal. 

Food: Okish
But Ive had better chicken and waffles at The White Brick Kitchen. However the citurs maple glaze was awesome!
For great BBQ try Smoke Bourbons.
And the biscuit were way too heavy, I guess I like my biscuit flakier. 
Their coffee YUCK!!!


Won't ever go back. Shame cause I love both BBQ and brunch."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have always left full and happy.

Since I do not live in the area, if there are no seats, which is usually the case, I just head across the street to McDicks and eat my delicious fried chicken there.

This is the best fried chicken in the city. Easily."}
{"text":"Where does one begin...The staff alone make the experience of eating at the Stockyard worth the price of admission (not very much I might add) 

BUT THE PORTIONS are ridiculously huge a 'Dinner' meal (under 16.00 with tax) is enough to feed 2 ample eating persons, and for those with normal appetites 4 people can easily eat out of the box (yes they put your food in a box for consumption). If only every eatery provided such satisfaction.

The decor is wonderful with a maritime feel, the only thing i'm surprised they don't have is a trough!

I would routinely go out of my way to go and eat at this wonderful place...put it on your list of places to dine this summer, you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and nearby location make this a favourite take out spot for me. 

I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the ribs. Pulled pork was delicious, and the accompanying coleslaw was amazing. I love a good slaw and the sort of mustardy style made here was incredible. 

Ribs are in the menu while supplies last, and only on certain days. Highly recommend getting in during those rib times though as they were delicious and cooked to perfection. 

Only downside is the seating arrangement inside and lack of space to eat in."}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming in and unfortunately they were not met. I got the stockyard dinner and it was extremely greasy. The chicken and fries were pre-cooked and then thrown back into the fryer when ordered. However, the menu items are fairly priced. I had a bite of the portobello burger which tasted great so this place is worth a try if you're in the area. 

I went on a Friday afternoon so the place wasn't too busy, but the place is quite small so the seats do fill up fast!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for dinner. I was looking forward to it a lot since I really liked it the last time I was here. I was disappointed this time.

The problem with this place is they are way too busy for their own good.

I waited an hour for my order, which was not that large (2 brisket sandwiches, fries, coleslaw, and a half-rack of ribs). This time includes probably 15-20 minutes in line and the rest just waiting. They actually had the order \"ready\" almost 10 minutes before they called our name. It just sat there. When I finally got the order the coleslaw ($5) was missing. We didn't realize it was missing until we had already left the restaurant.

The brisket sandwiches were delicious, the fries were not great (likely because they sat for so long and cooled off) and the ribs were tasty but kinda tough and chewy.

I want to like this place but until they have more space and better organization to deal with their popularity I won't be going back.

Sad."}
{"text":"Heart stopping breakfast sandwiches. Can't have em all the time but once in a while can't hurt. Extremely tasty. Extremely filling. Really busy for weekend brunch. Expect to wait."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for a Saturday morning brunch visit. We were warned about the lineups, so we came exactly at 9:00 AM and the place was virtually empty. We basically had the whole place to ourselves for most of our meal, which was probably a huge positive, as the restaurant is pretty narrow and it looks like it could get cramped fast. So note - come early if you want breakfast/brunch and a more relaxing, less-wait-times experience!

We ordered The Stockyard (deep fried poached egg with bacon on a buttermilk biscuit) and the Two Egg Breakfast (deep fried poached egg with potatoes, bacon, and toast), with coffee and tea. The quiet ambiance on an early Saturday was definitely a plus, but the meal itself was actually quite good. It was the first time I tried deep fried poached eggs, and the outside crispiness juxtaposed with the runny insides was delicious - the buttermilk biscuit was also really fluffy and tasty!

For two people, we paid around $30. It was, overall, a delicious breakfast. Very casual, rustic, with an almost industrial vibe. If you're looking for a fancy Cluny-type brunch or breakfast, this definitely isn't it. But if you want something super casual, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"God it's good. I can't speak its praises high enough. Go when they're serving ribs, the meal isn't complete without it. I drive all the way uptown to satisfy my cravings. They need to open a downtown location!"}
{"text":"If you like meat made well, look no further. Vast variety of options all cooked to perfection right in front of you. Cool atmosphere with friendly staff make it a hot spot in the area. Take out options are also great. If you are in the area it's a must to check out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stockyards Fried Chicken Combo(takes 15-20 minutes) 
Buttermilk marinated Fried Chicken, with Fries and Side Coleslaw($13.50). The girl talking to her friend was correct, it was a big enough portion for 2 therefore good value and especially when it only took 5 minutes to get my order I wasn't completely happy with the GREASE factor or the flavour. I guess I'm too used to seasonings(Salt, Tabasco, etc...) for Fried Chicken marinates rather than simply Buttermilk. (-0.5 to -1.00 *Star*) 

Half Rack Pork Ribs($13.00) had everything that you can ask for as the smokiness and the juiciness where all there. The flavour reminds me of Chinese BBQ Pork or Filipino Lechon, that is if you eat the appropriate part of the Chinese BBQ Pork. I would return for the Ribs, Yup. 

BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich - Apple and Hickory smoked Pork Shoulder topped with Coleslaw and Stockyards BBQ sauce on a classic store bought Bun($8.00). I like the flavour of the BBQ sauce as it wasn't explosive spicy and with the perfectly dressed fresh crunchy Coleslaw, it made for a delicious Sandwich. The only thing that I would fault it due to a personal preference is that the Pork was a bit tough almost chewy like Jerky. 50/50 chance I would get it on next visit. 

The space is really not meant for dining in and it almost feels uncomfortable even if you do, and that's probably why they tempt you with the Take-Out Bag that looks like you just shopped at A&F or something. I was even an adventure just to get across the line-up to pick-up my order from the waiting side to the pick-up side."}
{"text":"We stopped off for a quick bite to eat last night on our way home. I was a bit disappointed after I found out that they no longer have the butter burger on the menu... However, it turned out to be a non-issue, seeing as they have so many other things to order, and it seems like whatever they choose to have on the menu, they do extremely well. 

We ordered the fried chicken dinner again, because how could you not?!? They have some of the best fried chicken in Toronto, and the fries that come with it are AMAZING! We also decided to try The Dirty Thirty burger (a burger stuffed with house made smoked cheddar, blue cheese and topped with onion frites, pickles, and house mayo). Everything was fantastic and did not disappoint. Between the two of us, we ended up spending just under $30 with leftovers to bring home! 

I overheard the chef telling another customer that they were going to be offering smoked meat soon, so that is something to look out for...
The thing I am really excited about going back to try though, is the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"I feel the need to update my review due to a visit to The Stockyards last night. Their website said they were open until 9 so I walked over with a friend at 8:30 and we were turned away because they weren't \"seating anymore\". Another group of 3 and a couple also came by around the same time and were also turned away. Take-out only! 8:30pm is NOT an acceptable closing time on a Thursday, let alone on a holiday evening such as last night. 

I wonder how the owners would react to this, knowing that several customers were turned away simply for the convenience of the staff and their rigid closing hours. If you close at 9, you should be seating until 9 and dealing with the spillover of customers like any other service business that caters to the public. This was a real turn-off for me.

That said, the food is still delicious and I would come back but only during the day when I could be certain that I wouldn't be turned away because the staff wants to go home.

Also, can you please get a liqour license? Prohibition is passe."}
{"text":"wasn't there on a y wit the much touted ribs.... but the burger was good... but not good enough to make the boot up to st Claire..... kinda aggravating they cant offer a full menu everyday....just my 2 cents..."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and I really did try to pick an apartment closer to the stockyards. I am a very happy 20 minute walk away : ) 


The best 10/10 as to why I come is the fried chicken. It's just perfection. For $16 you get 4 pieces and wonderful fries. 

Ribs on Sunday and they are really good, but for $30 it's better to get 4 piece  chicken and full rack of ribs to split for 2. 

The pulled pork is good, but the coleslaw on the bun is not great so I take that off. They just don't go. 

The briskest is saweeet 

If you call ahead to order that helps as they are limited to seating. It gets very hot inside during the summer. 

It's so f'n good."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say what I ate here in one sitting but here goes. We got there late on a Friday night, so they were already out of the pulled pork, which didn't seem to matter since one of the specials on the board was the \"In-n-Out\" burger. Now let me tell you, this burger was better than the real thing. Absolutely incredible, and VERY similar to a real In-n-Out burger. Brought back memories of Vegas... 

The deep fried chicken (with hot sauce on the side) was like gourmet KFC, and the fries were also great. 

The hot dog was pretty good, and the brisket was also incredible. Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the grilled cheese, which comes with mushrooms and apple slices in it. I've definitely had better, and this was a let down.

After this feast, I thought I wasn't going to be able to eat again for days. But then I did. Oh, and I swear this meal was for 6 of us, not just me!

This place has VERY limited seating so it's more of a take-out situation. Everything is super quick, but the fried chicken takes about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been going to Stockyards for about a year and I cannot say enough about this place - it is unreal.

They do anything meat really well, especially ribs, brisket, fried chicken, and burgers. 
The ribs are only available Tuesday, Friday and Sunday - and call early to get them to reserve a rack for you. 

The burger is \"smash-griddled\" a-la- burger priest. I'd say it's not as good because the bun they use is a kaiser bun, but the toppings are better. I like the green chili burger from them. 

For brunch I've tried the Chicken & Waffles (amazing) and fried poached eggs. I don't think there is a place that does better fried chicken in Toronto than stockyards - if there is, I want to know about it!"}
{"text":"The food is great, though your order can easily be screwed up if it's for pickup... Word to the wise. Also, the girl at the front register can be all over the place"}
{"text":"The Stockyards has the best fried chicken I've had in the city.  Same goes for their onion rings.  The chicken is always moist and juicy.  The batter is a bit spicy but not hot at all.  For takeout, I strongly recommend calling ahead.  The time that they give you will be the time that your order is ready.  Their fries are good, but don't travel well in their packaging.  I find they will stay crispy a bit longer if you leave the box open.  They won't steam, but you will want to eat them as soon as you get home (before they get cold)."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I've ever had and I've tried it throughout the states. You can really taste the buttermilk and herbs.

Brunch is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I've been dying to check out this place FOREVER, so on tuesday I saw it on the way to my friends place and I WAS LIKE WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO GO.


So a few drinks later, I convinced them, It was 8.30, and the place closes at 9. I HAVE NEVER RAN SO FAST BEFORE.

They let us, but sadly they were out of the famous fried chicken! Not to worry though, I was SO DOWN FO DA BUTTAH.

I ordered the butter burger, and I dunno what to say. My life will never be the same.

PERFECT PATTY

BONE MARROW SLATHERED

RED WINE AND BLUE CHEESE BUTTER

I ate the first bite, and I was like

FUQ

WHAT IS THIS

AM I DRUNK OR THIS AMAZING.

(it was a bit of both)

I wanted to just shove the whole thing in my mouth at once. I almost did. Juice dripping down my arm.

Ugh god.

Got the fries, delicious.

My friend got the colesalw, not delicious. But who cares. Its a bbq. 

I will be here EVERYTIME i go to my friends place near by.

EVERY FREAKING TIME.

sidenotes:

I may have asked the guy making my burger to marry me, like three times.

{"text":"So yeah we know Mr Davis spent time in the usa eating 'cue and learning some tips and tricks on his road trip...we expect that from a BBQ master and we expect the best

He does deliver it in spades with an honest to goodness attention o the craft of serving fine BBQ done righteously so.

I have enjoyed his wares a dozen times and really its all good, just choose your meal and chomp away.

The challenge is for eat it the place is kind of small or shall i say tiny so waits can be expected but it seems the take away business is busier. The other challenge is you will also be smoked during your meal so plan accordingly. A tux and the opera afterwards will be a no no and your date will resent having smoky smelling stilleto heels as well. You were warned but then in the good old states or even texas smelly smoky is kind of normal.

ok so here is the sweetness of the night. As we left downtown crying that ban mih boys was closed and we were stuck wanting piggy it was like holy moley call stockyards....ohhhh noooooooooooooo they close at 8pm and its 7:50pm.....we call and order a box of pulled porked all steamed up ready to go and slaw on the side but the rest of the fixings were sold out and they were cleaning....but hey do not worry we will wait for you to come and pick it.....whew we got there at 8:05pm and no problem...door was open and order sitting on counter ready to roll.......

thankfully i already had jalapeno, fresh portugese buns at home....so as we bounced indoors it was a flurry of eating going on........just remember the pile of knapkins should hit the table before chowing down

take 2 scoops of coleslaw (creamy poppyseed), slices of jalapeno, pile on pulled pork, dab of mayo, pour on bbq sauce.....eat the pig like a pig...wipe...do another......

sit in or take out they are true bbq artists and do deserve the best bbq in the city award

that includes the fried chicken as well and i am sure he marinates the birds in buttermilk or something.....so dont just eat pulled pork ,,, share and order both"}
{"text":"on a rainy sat afternoon  we decided to stop by. Heard so many awesome reviews and i thought hey it's time for some burgers at the stockyards. 

well first of all the line up was waaaay too long. the seating is very limited there's maybe 15 seats altogether. waiting for the table took about 1.5 hrs. so by the time we sat down we're kinda grumpy already with the 1+ hr smelling of grilled meat and fried chicken and STARVED! oh did i mention the kitchen IS in the middle of the store? so yea there's no where to hide from the smell and splatter. 

the food is good. served on a skillet. fried chicken was crispy and the bat sandwich had thick bacon and green fried tomatoes which was a nice touch. oh here's a tip, if you get fried chicken, DONT' get another side order of fries... there's waaaay too much fries. 

the environment - ok i guess. feels a bit like a butcher shop where people are yelling and food is smoking right in front of you. bad for groups also because all the seating is like along the wall in a long strip. so if you have a group of 4 people, forget trying to hear your buddy that's sitting on the other end. 

i'd give 4 star for food, but the overall experience was a 3. sorry, wont' come again unless they expand and maybe... separate kitchen from my eating space."}
{"text":"No no no. I won't be herded like livestock to be given the \"privelige\" of eating middle of the road food. With the exception of the friendly young lady who runs the lineup the staff are unanimously lost at sea service wise.  Three times during my visit the \"waitress\" cut me off mid statement as she turned her back on me and hurried away.  Really ?  There is an army of staff and about 20 seats max. Manners are free folks.  Kitchen staff also think they are the second coming. Sit at the counter and listen to them eulogize about their awesomeness. Moving on.  Had the fried chicken dinner. Properly cooked. Huge portion - I'm not a big eater but it's dinner for two.  Underseasoned on every level. Ate what I could. Had a take out container thrown at me ( ya that happened ). Bill w a coke was 19$.  Threw a 20$ back and left."}
{"text":"Came here 2 months back with some friends and had 

*the buttermilk fried chicken (delicious, crunchy and not too oily)

*Butter Bone marrow burger (this was unique and flavor packed! would go back just for this)

*Pulled pork sammy was not note worthy. 

*The french fries were really good :)

Service was quick and the place was really busy, so we took a couple of seats by the windows. In and out within 45 mins!

TIP Cash only!!"}
{"text":"My rating is on the food and service. I just wish the place was bigger. 

Highly rated and featured on a couple of occasions in Toronto Life, this place is a must try for any non-vegetarian person living in or planning to visit to Toronto. Just make sure you plan ahead and by that I mean, be prepared to wait if you're going during peak hours and especially if your party consists of more than two people.

The fried chicken is a notch above the popular fried chicken chains. Ribs are only offered three evenings a week but they are among the city's best. Lastly, if you want a great burger coupled with some tasty fries, this place should be on your to-do list. Other great items on the menu include: brisket, chicken & waffles and buttermilk biscuits.

The fried chicken is not too greasy and has a nice flavour. I usually order the fried chicken dinner which is $14 and comes with fries & cole slaw. 

Their ribs have a great smoky flavour and are very juicy.  They are only available three nights a week because they don't take shortcuts when it comes time to smoking the ribs. I've been to places before where they pre-boil the ribs and I could tell when there was a bit of an \"off\" after taste.

Lastly, the burger I had I think was one of the best the city has to offer.  I haven't had it often because sometimes I can't justify the 30 minute drive and the 15 minute wait for just a burger but if there's one that is worth the trouble, this is one of them."}
{"text":"Us: \"We'll have the fried chicken, pulled pork sandwich, the pototo salad and the grilled cheese, with cracklin' of course. Should we order a side of fries too?\"

Server: Firmly, \"No!\"

When the food came out, I could immediately see why we didn't need a second side of fries. The 4 pieces of buttermilk fried chicken were hidden beneath a sea of shoestring fries - that alone was almost enough of a meal for the 3 of us. 

But the star of the show for me was said grilled cheese with green apple, mushrooms add the addition of bacon and cracklin'. I'll work double time on the elliptical for you, my lovely lard friend!"}
{"text":"In need of a place to feed my small town father and his long-time best friend (like, 50+ years since they were chitlins long-time long-time), I settled on the obvious:  they both love BBQ.  So, where do I take them?  Sure, Hogtown has no shortage of options... but really, there was only one choice:  Stockyards.

So, armed with the assurance of a son who knows his dad can't resist a Fred Flintstone calibre rack of ribs, I dragged them out of the comforts of my 'hood to the uncharted waters of St Clair North...

Verdict?  Unabashed praise, amigos, oh yes, they loooooved them some Stockyards!

Pops had a full rack of ribs with a large serving of fries (lunacy!); best friend braved the Butter Burger with a side of said fries.  

Ribs:  They defeated my once mighty father, standing as Ali to my dad's Sonny Liston.  Still, he couldn't be happier as he bibbed himself clean.

Butter Burger:  \"What'd'ya expect, Patrick -- it was greasy!  Good though!  Greasy!\"  Honestly I think he kinda regrets not getting something else, not because it wasn't delicious, but because it was his monthly intake of butter in one sitting.  At 60+ years of age, that's not inconsiderable.

As for me, fried chicken platter.  Oh my, way way way too much food for one person, and hey, I'm pushing 6'4\" and I'm not exactly wafer-thin.  I ate about half, and took the rest home to Heather (who sung the take-away's praises while joyfully stuffing her face).

So, why not 5 stars?  Well, as good as it was (and it was good!), really, I've had better BBQ on all counts.  Better ribs, better chicken, better fries... can't speak to the burger, but I've probably had a better one of those, too.  In light of the vast praise heaped upon Stockyards, I just can't seem to take it out of context.  I was expecting the best or damned close to it, and I was... \"disappointed\", though still quite happy.  I'm sure we'll be back.

As a great place for carnivores it's hard to beat -- tiny spot but cool vibe, very friendly staff, dependable, tasty food, and prices that seemed a bit too low for what we were getting (enough that it kinda makes me wonder where all that meat is really being sourced from).

Now back to my mostly vegetarian diet."}
{"text":"All the food here is great, especially their chicken and waffles. Be prepared for a long wait small place but well worth it. The ribs and their burger are also very good. No matter how many times I go back I am never disappointed. The staff is very pleasant as well."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, my first time being years ago, where I was so disappointed by the BAT I just had to back here to give it another shot and I'm glad I did! I wanted to like this place so badly as everything about it seemed so awesome. It's such a small and lively joint.

Came here with a buddy on an early Friday evening for a dine-in and unfortunately the pit smoked chicken and the brisket was already sold out! Okay no problem, the fried chicken was there to save us. We sat across the kitchen, and it was definitely HOT. We were both sweating.

I immediately chuckled when I was the fried chicken. It was served on a cast-iron. I'm like how am I going to finish this? But it's so good you won't even have problems. Or you can share it! I recommend doing that.. or do I? So four ginormous pieces of extremely crispy fried chicken. It was some of the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Even the chicken breast, being like two inches thick was juicy the entire way through. Their shoestring like fries were also excellent and there's no shortage of it.The coleslaw was nice and had some real acidity to it. 

We also ordered ice tea which is the perfect compliment for fried chicken. It's super refreshing and went down well with the fried chicken. I loved the kick of ginger in the iced tea. 

Service could have definitely been more attentive. I know this is not to be meant as a full service kind of place but I expected just a bit more - we had to ask for utensils and water. The food did take quite a while to be prepared but it was all worth it in the end. I'm totally getting that BBQ next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Any time we are in the area this is our go to. They are a smokehouse and do an incredible job at ribs, fried chicken and of course their famous burgers. Last time I was there I had the beast burger! It was amazing! Nice a juicy with a perfect amount of pink in the center of the patties. There is something to be said about the fries that come with your burger as well. There are only two places in the city that I will eat a burger and this is one of them! Do yourself a favour and head in and grab a seat at the counter and watch them griddle smash you're freshly ground in house patties. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have lived in this neighbourhood for years and have visited The Stockyards and handful of times. Our experiences have always been pretty good.

I have to say though, the lady running the front of house was so grumpy and rude it really soured our experience. As soon as we walked in, we heard her yelling at a customer who was trying to make a pickup order about how she was out of BBQ and to pick something else. We didn't realize someone was waiting in front of us so when the waitress went to seat us, she barked as us to wait as it was someone else's turn. I honestly wanted to turn around and leave but bae really wanted a burger there so I sucked it up. I sensed the waitress knew the front of house lady was a jerk so was extra nice to us.

Since I now eat more veggies and fish, there wasn't a lot for me to choose from on the menu. I was excited to see they had a portobello veggie burger and ordered that. The waitress informed me sadly they were out of it that evening so I ended up with a grilled cheese and coleslaw instead. The grilled cheese was ok but had too much cheese IMO, and it spilled out the sides when I ate it. Overall, the food was alright but it really wasn't what I was looking for.

Given this most recent experience, we won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is solid when available, but like most hipster joints, they need to work on their customer service and keeping up with demand. Most trips here I've been faced with many items being \"sold out\", even when arriving at a reasonable hour (~7pm). You'd think that they'd keep track of volume and plan accordingly (yeah, I know it's a bbq joint and they only 'make so much' but heck, I've been to several joints in the Southern US with the same tact and they seem to be able to keep up with demand). It's just an annoyance. Each time I have a hankering for bbq I drive by and my mind always goes to the umpteen trips where I'm told \"we're out of that\" and I second guess and head to Alberts instead for jerk or curry chicken.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"The service was very down to earth and everyone was so friendly. Our server continued to joke around with us throughout our meal making it a very home like experience. 

The food is everything! It doesn't matter what you order since it'll be amazing either way."}
{"text":"The stockyards was built around Target Canada. They are slowly filling that giant gap. They just added Shoeless Joes. 
This is going to turn into a better place. Right now it is second rate"}
{"text":"This place was great...until they took out the butter burger. 

I've been there many times and majority of my visits, I have the butter burger.
A burger with red wine reduction sauce with bone marrow and topped with boston lettuce leaves. So. Good.

The place is not the cheapest. Super casual but you get what you pay for here. The people who serve are always welcoming and nice. The staff cooking are fun to watch and sometimes are funny.

I've tried almost everything on the menu but I always go back to the butter burger. The fried chicken is moist and crunchy on the outside and the portion is huge but personally chicken is my least favorite protein. Not crazy about the brisket or pulled pork. 

Although...their coleslaw is really good! I'm picky with coleslaw but everytime my boyfriend and I go, I get him to order something that comes with it so I can steal it off of him. He's the best.

You know what else is the best? The butter burger. Ugh."}
{"text":"Almost a 5 star and being one of the few BBQ joints in Toronto, it is likely the best of the limited cuisine types in the city.

The fried chicken (by the half) is really top notch. Great value, crisp and moist. Lives up to the billing.

The pulled pork sandwich was also filling and with a lovely sauce slathering the deliciously juicy meat inside.

Pulled pork sandwich was tasty but a bit dry.

Excellent service, packed in. Prepare for a fight for seats"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place was on Diners Drive Ins and Drives until I was in line waited to be seated. The staff there is very friendly and do a good job keeping everything calm in what is clearly a hetic environment. I had the ribs with fries, and they were both a home run. My wife had the pulled pork and she loved it as well. They only complaints I have was that there were no refills on drinks, no ice in the drinks, and that it was very small. Those are the only things that stopped me from giving this place a 5. Food was on point!"}
{"text":"It's not like this place needs any more positive reviews, but I need to say my piece - this place is AMAZING!! I had the pulled pork sandwich and was speechless. The pulled pork sandwich had some coleslaw in it which added a nice crisp base to the bbq flavor. My boyfriend had a porchetta sandwich which which wasn't too saucy and brought out the flavors of the herbs and spices with the pork. The rapini was also a nice added touch to the porchetta. Portions were great, and the fact that it was served in a cast iron frying pan is so novel and adds character to the plate. The shoestring fries were light and crispy. Can't wait next time to try the smoked chicken - only this time we'll have to go early because apparently it goes fast!"}
{"text":"Only been here twice, both times gotten the buttermilk fried chicken with fries. Portions were as good as it can get for chicken I guess... It was like 4 peices of chicken ontop of a plate of fries. The chicken was better the first time I went, the 2nd time the skin was too crunchy and burnt/overcooked. You can almost forget about seating as this place is small and pretty much always packed. I tried coming a 3rd time with a few friends and there was a huge lineup so we got back in the car and looked for another place."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken Review

Very good just not quite 5 stars, it was a bit salty for my liking but the meat was very tender and flavorful and the skin was crisp and not too greasy though I do wish the skin was slightly crispier. Still much better than anything else I've had in Toronto except my flatmate's fried chicken. 

Basically everything was done well, the fries, coleslaw, and chicken were all made with more attention than most restaurants in Toronto. Just don't find myself dying to go back for more. Perhaps my expectations were too high?

I would like to try many other things on the menu so will probably be back soon."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, lively vibe going on except it was getting stuffy half way through the meal because we sat across from the open kitchen. This place is small, so more than half of the customers were getting take-outs. We ordered half rack of ribs ($15) and fried chicken dinner ($15). The ribs were huge!! Ribs are only available on Tues, Fri, and Sun starting at 5pm. We wanted to get a pit smoked whole chicken but it was already sold out (got there at 6pm). So come early to claim your food before it's all gone! Lots of meat on the ribs, nice bbq sauce (not too sweet and perfect level of acidity) but they were on the dry and chewy side. I like those fall-off-the-bone ribs. The fried chicken dinner dish, oh boy, came with four big pieces of fried chicken and loads of fries! chickens were fried perfectly: juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Fries were okay, nothing special about them. We had almost half of our food left to take home. The price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. 

Overall, I would recommend this place for a casual dinner/lunch (they also have brunch) spot!"}
{"text":"I went on rib night for ribs.  The ribs were humongous and really fatty.  I don't like fatty ribs, nor humongous things in my mouth so I was a bit disappointed.  

The restaurant doesn't serve beer, which is also disappointing.  Who eats ribs without beer?  If you do, you are not a real man.  

I ordered a root beer.  It was some natural cane sugar b.s. organic soda pop.  It was alright.

Overall...with the waiting around, small cramped surroundings, fatty mcribs and a soda pop, I left a bit wanting."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed but still great food. They only serve bbq ribs and chicken on certain days so we had to settle for the fried chicken dinner and pulled pork sandwich. Both were good but i'm not a huge fan of fried chicken and the pulled pork sandwich wasn't anything special. I'm going to hold off having a final opinion until we go back and try the ribs."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot to rate this place!  I visited Stockyards in the summer of 2016 after searching for a chicken and waffle place to try.  
First impression was that this place is TINY! seating is limited.  I was so worried I might not get a set,  but to my luck,  there was room for us on the bar table right in front of the cooks!  What great entertainment,  watching them cook the dishes right in front of me.  Only bad thing is that it was summer in Toronto,  with no A/C, and I was sitting in a hot kitchen crammed with people!  Haha
Our server was great,  very high energy and obviously a people person. I came for the chicken and waffles,  my friend ordered the grilled cheese (to my server's dismay). She said that everyone HAD to try the chicken,  so she gave me an extra piece to give to my friend!  Was a great surprise! 
The chicken was incredible,  crispy,  flavourful,  delicious.  Everything I was craving.  Waffle was great too,  but chicken stole the show!  
I will be back to The Stockyards again when the mood hits for great chicken.  Only downfall is the location...  It's out of the way for me,  in a part of the city I would not have any reason to visit ( if it wasn't for this food) ."}
{"text":"If you have not tried Stockyards - then get off your butt and go!  Really original and totally indulgent food - We live near by so we have been a bunch of times.  Love the Spicy burger, the pulled pork, the fried chicken...you can count on it all.  Brunch is pretty intense...I didn't try the chicken & waffles, but they were insane looking.  I usually just order to go, but the few times we have snagged a seat it has been a fun experience...will be back many times...well not too many or my clothes won't fit!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning to try out their legendary (so I've read) waffles and chicken.  Was not disappointed!

The place is small but not as tight as some reviewers make it out to be.   We went it as soon as it opened at 9 and it didn't fill up until about 10.  The counter seating was comfortable and gave a great view of the prep/cook action.  Our server was quite friendly and we chatted a bit.  On to the food..

Waffles and chicken - niiiiiice.  Got the 2 piece, though reading previous reviews yeah maybe shouldn't gotten 4 and taken some home.  The waffles and chicken are nice, maybe a 4/5 each, but that sauce, man that sauce - that brought the whole thing together into a 5/5.  Maple, lightly spicy..  Brought the sweet waffle and savoury chicken together perfectly.  Drooling just typing about it.

One of my comrades got a burger, extra spicy - that was pretty nice too.  Came with some kind of interesting sausage-based sauce thing on the side - ok bad description, but tasted incredible.  The burger itself was on a buttermilk biscuit, which they brought us as an appetizer as well (with jam), and wow - heaven.. so good..

Let's see - anything negative to say?  Probably not.. I did get lovingly 'yelled' at for coming in the unlocked front door at 8:50 whilst being gestured to the \"we're closed\" sign (they open at 9), though when someone else went in at 8:58 with the sign still flipped they didn't get the same love.  Whatever.. And they don't take Amex - but really, who does? Minor stuff - nothing I'd ding over.  The experience was the best.  Only suggestion I have is - if you don't want people coming in before 9, keep the door locked like everywhere else does!  (keeps out illiterates like me that can't read signs)

Will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and ribs were sold out but I got my hands on the brisket...dammmmmn guy that was some fine brisky.

Go in wearing clothes you don't care about because it gets stinky (good way) in there.  I'm currently airing my jacket and scarf, fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I had a half rack of ribs and cole slaw, both excellent and both very generously proprtioned. The dry ribs were large, the meat full of flavour though the side sauce I thougfht a bit sour. The cole slaw was great tasting. This is a first rate BBQ joint, and the line up for takeout was out the door. There were, however, a few stools at the bar at 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"This is easily the best fried chicken that I've ever had.  The 48 hours brining/marinating process ensures that the chicken is moist after it hits the fryer.  The fries are crispy and the small ramekin of hot sauce is a nice touch.  The only reason I don't give htis place a five star rating is because it's so small and can be difficult to get a seat in."}
{"text":"I'll be honest: I was somewhat broke at the time so I just went for one of the cheapest items on the menu: the Classic Burger. Don't get me wrong, the burger was just fine - it just wasn't fantastic.

Only later did I realize that the fried chicken is where it's at with The Stockyards. I'll definitely be back, try the chicken, and re-write this review.

In the meantime, the major takeaway is that the burgers are decent and that the fried chicken is (apparently) freakin' fantastic."}
{"text":"Fried chicken on waffles -- that would have been SO good, if it weren't for the spicy sauce. I am a girl who does not like her food spicy, at all, not even a little -- and I would have enjoyed this so much more if it weren't so spicy. I mean come on - fried chicken, and waffles! Dream combo. 

 I do want to go back and try their burgers. 

If you like spicy food (which most of the world does!) try this place, it is pretty great."}
{"text":"You know it, you love it, it's the Stockyards. Not much more to add that hasn't already been said. Fantastic food, friendly service.

Just can't believe with the money they must be making that they wouldn't spring for a better venue, with better/more seats. I get that it's mainly a take-out joint but come on!

Anyway, best fried chicken I've ever had. YUM"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the portions are dangerously generous. If you can make it on a Tuesday or Friday, go for the ribs (they're only available on select days). It's a shame, however, that the place isn't large enough to hold tables. There are some stools for sitting, but they're in high demand."}
{"text":"Went back today after not having been for probably 6 months. Every bit as good as I remember. There is no way to debate the best burger in the city without Stockyards being part of the discussion. Probably no. 1 in the City in my book."}
{"text":"I could not believe how good this place was!

We shared an order of the Double Burger and the Beef Brisket Sandwich and both were amazingly good!  So much flavor and richness in every bite.  The smokey flavor did amazing things for those meat dishes.  Each dish had the perfect amount of saltiness and sweetness and they did it better than most other BBQ spots.

This is a must-visit spot for anyone!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a near perfect score because my pulled brisket sandwich was outta bounds, but the owner left a sour taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, the food is delish! I would've come back another night of my weekend, but I'll take a pass! Me and my husband drove up from NYC (nearly 400 miles) to Niagara Falls for the weekend, and went up to Toronto (another hour or so driving) to see the hockey hall of fame. We only came to this place because it was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives on Food Network. I merely took maybe 30 seconds to close the door to take a picture with Guy Fieri's sign, and owner scolded me saying \" We need the door open its too hot inside of here.\" Which I snapped a picture, closed the door and even fixed the mat that was behind the door! I wasn't leaving without my picture!!! 
There must be another BBQ place in Toronto because I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Stockyard for brunch? What a great surprise, short menu but to the point. Thoroughly   enjoyed the experience.. Good service, coffee, bacon, biscuits, sausage and chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Tried the 2-pc fried chicken & waffles here on a Sat afternoon - they were delish! Service is super speedy, it does get pretty crammed though, so skip the stroller/oversized bags/anything that doesn't fit on a stool.
Chicken is lightly dusted with breading, super juicy - love the spicy glaze yum - 2pc was MORE than enough for 1 person ($12)
Love watching the chefs at work (next time I must try the pork sandwich!).
Walk-in's only.
Can get pretty busy on the weekends (chicken & waffles are only served until 3)
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is some seriously good chicken. Whether it's the fried chicken or chicken and waffles (seriously, if you haven't tried it, you MUST) this place is up there with the best homemade fried chicken from the southern US. Prices are a little high but worth it for the occasional spoil-session."}
{"text":"By far the best fried chicken I've had in a while. The batter is what makes me a fan, it was light yet crispy. People say it's a family sized, but who I can eat this family size. Four pieces of juicy chicken and so much fries it'll give you a heart attack. But what a way to go.

The ribs, I liked them a lot until I saw them the next day (took them to go). If you like the fat, these ones have a layer of it between the top layer of meat and the bottom layer of meat. But that day I ordered it, so soft they fell off the bone.

And you gotta finish it off with a black cherry soda.

The decorations were cool, not too many seats. If you sit along the wall you'll be staring at yourself.

Nevertheless, come here for the chicken and ribs!"}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles were great! The chicken was perfect!! I wasn't a huge fan of the waffle (would have liked it to be a bit more crispy). Wished the chicken and waffles came with a side. Prices are reasonable. 

Small place so you may have to wait for a while, and the seating arrangement can be a little odd (a group of 4, we were all facing the wall, not each other), but it all adds to the character of the place."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is a neighbourhood joint full of character and great food! 
Went on a Tues night for their ribs special, and the ribs had a great smoke ring and bark, and came with a side of tangy BBQ sauce. Added on some delicious, not-too-heavy coleslaw, and that full rack was more than enough food for 2 people! Some may find the ribs a bit lean and not as heavily seasoned - to each their own. 
Pro tip: they usually sell out of ribs by 6:30, but if you call ahead and ask really nicely, they may set aside a rack for you! 
Counter seating only -- we had an up-close view of the cooks while they were working, and they struck a great balance of leaving us alone to enjoy our food while adding an amusing comment every now and then. 
Overall, would love to come back and try some of their other offerings, like the burgers and brisket sandwich!"}
{"text":"Had Fried Chicken Waffle here - absolutely amazing! Very close to the ones I've tried in Texas before. Go there if you're really hungry - great for hungover brunch!"}
{"text":"still good but their quality is definitely slipping.  Maybe they are coasting on their reputation but its not as good as it used to be but still very good."}
{"text":"Two of my all time favorite things to eat available in one spot. Fried chicken and burgers ^^  the Beast Burger is mesmerizing and their fried chicken is always made to order hot, crispy and juicy. MmMmm good~ Making me salivate just thinking about it. It's a tiny space and most of the seating is counter style. One tip would be to order for take out and sit outside the restaurant and eat so you're not sweating from the tremendous heat inside."}
{"text":"Fine folks rave about the chicken and waffles year after year, but I'll have me some fine burgers as well. Mmm mmm, griddlin' goodness. Throw in some of that yummy fries too, and pig out on the decent prices.

Small as it is inside, The Stockyards is big on keeping the classic neighbourhood diner vibe going. I was more blown by the hospitality than by the food here. The host strikes a word or two with everyone, many of which appear to be nearby resident regulars. Comforting food flies into the hands of a steady stream of advance order takeouts, which seems to be a popular way of enjoying their goods.

{"text":"We went to eat their last week and sat at the bar. We watched the cooks in the open kitchen and were shocked at how unorganized things were and the lack of quality in the food preparation. 

The guy with the big hole plug things in his ears seemed to be the leader but I have never seen such a poorly organized operation. 

After sat there for 40 minutes and watching them take care of all the take out orders and walk ins and ignoring all the people sitting 2 feet away from them. 

The guy beside us walked out after earrings gave him a vague answer on if the 20 orders on the grill contained his order and the people behind us were waiting an hour. 

I saw the cooks send their prized fried chicken out to unlucky take out orders that had been sitting in the frier basket for minimum 1 hour. 

I asked where our order was twice and and when they finally paid attention we watched them plate up the old dried up chicken for us. We told them to make a fresh batch and throw that old stuff out am stop serving it. What a joke. Though we had the fresh chicken it still is a step down from KFC. Pretty bland. 

When I told the cashier about what a joke it was she blamed on the new guy but he was the only one actually doing a good job. 

Think twice about eating at this place. And definitely don't bother eating in. After watching for over an hour I wouldn't eat anything but a burger perhaps because that was the only thing they actually prepared fresh."}
{"text":"I tried their pulled chicken sandwich, which was a special that day--maybe it's not on the regular menu for a reason...at least the fries were good.

I really wasn't impressed with that sandwich. The barbecue sauce was vinegary, and frankly, was the inappropriate sauce to toss the chicken in. I know these folks are famous for other things. Perhaps my advice is \"skip the pulled chicken sandwich\""}
{"text":"Well, Stockyards has been a staple go-to when i'm in the area since I've first came here. The fried chicken there is amazing. It was lightly battered and juicy when you eat it and the fries were salted well. There's only a few cons that I can list about this place. 

First of all, space. Unfortunately, this location is incredibly popular, so you can't go to it during a peak time otherwise you will be left waiting for over 30 minutes. They do NOT take reservations. If you live closeby, then yes, you can definitely do take out, which they do quite a bit of btw. Seating is bar seating and you are crammed. So, honestly, if you want to take a date here, that's probably not going to fly too well because you probably don't want both of you to be intimately touching other random people. But it is good to take a casual friend! 

The food is great and for the price, it's something worth having as a comfort food or special brunch. I felt the service was a bit lacking in terms of, they were trying to get you in the door, served and then once you're done, out the door. I can understand that, but I felt rushed, but then again, when you have enough people to fill your restaurant again waiting outside the door, you gotta move quick.

Had the fried chicken dinner, was plentiful and great. I would get it again. My partner had the dirty bird, which was a fried chicken on a waffle with a mayo-like sauce/eggs/bacon/etc. That one was somewhat heavy, but filling. Although I say it's a bit pricey, it's definitely worth the value. They also do ribs on a few days and i've had a consistently good meal here everytime i've gone.

Price: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 5/5
Price Point: 5/5"}
{"text":"(sob) No ribs available. (louder sobbing) 
 No smoked meat available. (even louder sobbing) 
Buttermilk soaked fried chicken is available! (sigh of relief) Fuck the Colonel and his finger licking KFC, get your ass up to St. Clair and Christie Street and eat some real kick ass fried chicken. 

Did a quick pit stop on the way home to the rolling hills of Caledon and grabbed up an order of their house specialty fried chicken. It's still 12 bucks for an order, a 20 minute wait and comes with a freaking sky high pile of crispy, skinny fries. La dolce vita. I opened up the box on the way home to let the steam out so the fries and the chicken wouldn't get soggy. Couldn't help but to toss out a chicken leg bone as I cruised up Hwy. 50 (hey c'mon, it's compostable so don't be giving me any of that don't litter the highway grief). 

Got home and my SO was lured away from his 52\" plasma tv and Monday night football by the aroma of this chicken. I just love it when something as simple as fried chicken, not just any fried chicken mind you, we are talking the Stockyards fried chicken, can get such good loving out of a man! :) 

By the way, they are now offering a very interesting Sunday special. Black Angus Prime Rib Dinner in a box for FOUR. You get medium rare meat, smashed spuds, green beans and some sort of apple crispy dessert. Major meat, we are talking Grade A Black Angus Beef, with all the fixings. Price tag $90.00. If it's meat from the SY's....it'll be worth every single penny. 

Go to the Stockyards. Go now. Go by streetcar. Go by foot. Go by car. Hitch a ride. Crawl if you have to. Just go. Best BBQ in the city. Best smoker in T.O. It'll be worth every minute of the effort. Call first though to see what's available. Ribs aren't there every night. Some smoked meat, like Caplansky's is subject to availability."}
{"text":"(accidently missed posting this from 12/25/2015)

I used to be a Saturday and/or Sunday morning regular at stockyards when I lived in Toronto, and they have the best comfort breakfast/brunch menu. 

Enough people have talked about the food, I wanted to give a five star shout out to the service from the guy working the flat top today. He overheard me talking about how all I wanted when I was back in Toronto for the day was to get some biscuits and gravy from stockyards but unfortunately it's a weekend thing and today was Tuesday.  They had biscuits  so I got some to go, and before it was wrung up he slipped in a container of the sage/pepper sausage gravy.

It made my day. The rest of our day totally sucked but I was reminded about getting the surprise gravy and it totally redeemed it. Kind of service they try to teach knuckleheads in seminars.

Keep up the good work / lifelong customer here."}
{"text":"I just went to the stockyards and tried the fried chicken dinner (4 pieces + fries + coleslaw + hot sauce side)...  My only complaint would be that the chicken was a little bland for my tastes... that being said the chicken was very tender and moist and probably the best I've had in a while... If they spiced up the buttermilk marinade I'd definitely give it another star...  I'll probably go back occasionally as it was overall a good chicken meal and a great value as it could easily feed 2 people...   The place was pretty busy and the ribs looked good; I think I'll try those next time I go and post another review then...  Cheers..."}
{"text":"no doubt it's good food, maybe the best fried chicken i've had.
negative; pricey and the small spot is jammed (good for them, or maybe be better in bigger location...) but not great for the customer, who may ultimately avoid it cuz it's more hassle than it's worth..."}
{"text":"So I tried this for the first time the other day.  Yummy.  Went for the beef brisket (delish) - they were out of pulled pork.  It was a rib night, at about 6:30/7pm, while waiting for our order, we watched several people leave in dismay about ribs being sold out.

Totally check this out - it's supremely yummy"}
{"text":"As we waited almost 15 minutes for water, we waited another 15 minutes for coffee - with no offer of a refill. I order the burger with baked beans - the burger came with cold fries. The asked the lady (Who I assume is the owner) for my beans...she seemed super put off by this. They came quickly, however I had no cutlery. I asked her for some and she brought me a fork. She had a knife in her and I was reaching for it, but I was scolded by her - she says \"what do you need a knife for to eat a burger?!\" Sorry miss, but I'm not a savage and I wanted to dip my burger bun into my beans and a knife would come in handy...this is a restaurant and we aren't camping...She was appalled, but handed over the knife. At this point I have no coffee in my cup, and no napkin - this is rough, and I felt I was inconveniencing her for simple things that I need I order to enjoy a meal. All the while she's yelling at the cooks from the opposite end of the place while people keep calling (no ones answering the phone) and people keep coming in the door (no ones there greeting them). It was pure chaos and not an enjoyable atmosphere. Dirty dishes all over the front cashiers area and I never once seen them wipe any tables off after clearing them...

They need to step up the customer service big time.

Soooo then my bill comes - and I'm charged for two sides, when I clearly just asked for one. I point this out and they said that they left it there because I had ate some of the fries on my plate. I have worked in restaurants all my life, and I have never heard of the server charging for something even though the mistake was on her end...I admit that I had a few fries, but they were taking up half my plate. They were cold and droopy, so I didn't get to deep into them. At this point I'm just fed up and wanted to GTF outta there. 

I asked if the service was always like this and she replied yes in a very bitchy tone. I replied well at-least the food was good - and she responded - \"I just stand here and smile when customers complain\" 
I wasn't complaining, just stating the facts about how my experience was. It's like they know the food is good and don't need to impress the guests on anything else...super annoying to deal with a restaurant that operates under this idea.

I won't be back - that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I think this place is amazing but I cannot give it a full five stars for a few reasons. The place is very disorganized and hectic, due to the turnover of cooks mostly. The servers are seasoned and been there a long time. They have to carry the load for the new people which causes them to make mistakes. They often have issues with their POS system which makes them cash only from time to time. Although that sound bad, they are still four stars because of the overall experience. Food is outstanding, it is consistently prepared despite kitchen turnover. It is a neighborhood favourite, everyone in the area knows and loves stockyards, it's a place to go on Friday night for a burger or on Sunday night for a pulled pork or ribs. They have Sunday brunch too. Their customer service approach is genuine and laid back. If you sit up at the bar near the grill, you can have a chat with the cooks and the servers. They get to know their regulars and treat even newcomers like family. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are healthy. I have never had a bad experience here, despite them running out of things often and mix-ups with orders here and there. Don't expect them to have everything always, they make their burgers in house and only cook a certain amount of pulled pork, brisket, ribs based on what they expect to sell. But this means a fresh and amazing tasting product when you do get there in time. It's an amazing feeling to get the last rack of ribs of the day. Definitely a must go place for any Torontonian, especially anyone living in the St Clair West Community."}
{"text":"This place is tiny, very minimal. I went for Saturday brunch so I have no idea what the BBQ is like but I hear amazing things!!!! I has the smoked trout and scrambled egg sandwich on a bagel. It comes with onions on a poppy seed bagel. GAHHH IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!! I never thought of mixing smoked fish with scrambled eggs like that... It was (i think..) $7, didn't order anything to drink because they bring you water so there was no need. 

It was really busy, there was a bit of a lineup but nothing crazy. There are no separate tables inside, there's a bar-type seating arrangement along the wall, at the window and also right in front of where the food is being cooked if you're the kind that likes to watch. Service was nice, quick and sweet. I don't think it deserves any points taken off for décor because the place is small and cozy, it's good if you're on the go and want something delicious. I would go here again to try the BBQ because everything was fresh and delicious - AND they weren't stingy on the trout. You DO NOT want to feel the wrath of Anastasiya when she's been ripped off of smoked fish.

If you're on St Clair West - do it up. Seriously. A tiny restaurant like this being as busy as it was? You know it's a not-so-secret gem!

P.S. I went here without Abbas. I will forever regret it and words cannot express how guilty I feel. 

xoxo."}
{"text":"It's been a while since someone has put in a review. 

On my first note, it was quite a long wait even at 1:45pm and they close brunch on Sunday at 2:45pm. If you're looking to chit chat with a good friend for hours, this place isn't for you. There's very limited seating and many people in line to try their food. 

The servers are extra friendly and super loud! It's actually pretty entertaining. The kitchen is in the front so you can actually get a seat where you can watch them cook up the meals. The songs they put on is super old school and it creates a really nice atmosphere.

I ordered the famous chicken and waffles (there's 2 or 4 servings of chicken depending on what you feel for). I guess I'm bias with my opinion of the chicken and waffles but I'm not quite a big fan of their chicken breading. It fell apart and it was quite thick. I did really like their Belgian waffles and their spicy maple syrup. That was absolutely delicious. 

I think you can give it a try as I sat right in front of where they cooked and plated and it was very nice to see so much soul and heart go into a plate of food. It would be a 3.5 if I could give that."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, so I frequent this place a lot.  In my view, it is the best BBQ in Toronto.  I highly recommend the Pit Smoked Chicken.  The Ribs are also very good.  The BBQ sauce is excellent.  They only serve the Smoked Chicken and Ribs on Tues, Fri, and Sun.  Don't ask me why.  They should serve it everyday, as they are the signature items on the menu.   If they did, they would get even more of my business.  The organic greens are usually a good side order with the meat.  Unfortunately, they do not always have them, because they insist on using produce that is local and in season (I cannot quibble with this).  The value is incredibly good for very tasty food.  The service is pleasant and attentive, considering that they do very brisk business.  The place is completely unpretentious (which I like), and the food is clearly the focus here, which is as it should be."}
{"text":"This place is really good but I'm honestly a little surprised by the five-star reviews which drew me here. I went with a friend and we ordered the fried chicken, pulled pork sandwich, and bbq brisket sandwich. We sat at the bar, and we both thought that the service was good and the ambiance was what we expected. Prices are a little high for such casual food, but not unreasonable at all. We had both read many reviews before going to The Stockyards, and were very excited for some good heavy comfort food. Perhaps our expectations were too high, as neither of us were blown away by the food (save for the fried chicken).

Fried Chicken - 10/10 - moist and juicy and flavourful and large portion
Fries (with the fried chicken) - 5/10 - they looked good but were very mediocre
Coleslaw (with the fried chicken) - 4/10 - no real flavour here
BBQ Brisket - 8/10 - very tasty, although the condiments on the sandwich kind of overwhelm the beef taste. also the baguette was an odd choice to hold the brisket - a roll would be superior.
Pulled pork sandwich - 6.5/10 - did not live up to the hype at all... the bbq sauce was very bland and the coleslaw added nothing. I was severly dissapointed by the pulled pork.

I probably would have given this place 3/5 stars but the fried chicken really was fantastic - not sure if I'll go again, but the burgers on the flat-top intrigued me a lot, so maybe another visit is in the cards..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I would recommend the fried chicken. The only thing I would not recommend was the brisket sandwich, I found it way too sweet."}
{"text":"You'll wait 20-30 minutes when you arrive, this is normal, deal with it, and I really suggest you do as you will not be disappointed.

I had their burger and my wife had their vegetarian mushroom burger.  Hands down one of the best burgers I've eaten, and I'm Texan.  The meat was so tender it was falling apart in the bun.  There was no small amount of fries on the side as well, which were also extremely good.

The only reason I'm giving this 4/5 is that I ordered a half chicken to go, and found it to be very dry.  Having said that, I didn't eat it until a few hours later so it may just be that its one of those things you need to eat fresh to really enjoy it.  It was smoked which already dries it out quite a bit, so I will try the chicken next time I go to give it a fair shake.

Would definitely go again and again, as well as recommend."}
{"text":"Wow.  Delicious chicken.   
Best BLT I have ever ate. 

The only downside is the lack of seating as pointed out by others.  Otherwise 5 stars.  This is almost an attribute that makes it special. 

Been to Nashville for hot chicken and this is as close as this gets in the TO.  

Can't wait to make it one of our regulars and will try the burger next time!"}
{"text":"soo many reviews yet such high rating . i have nothing significant to add as i feel the same as the majority of these reviews .

thee BEST fried chicken in toronto . period . i'll never feel the same for popeyes ever again .

i dont enjoy white meat . i especially dont like chicken breast . i dont find the appeal of it . its dry and chewy no matter how its cooked . at stockyards, this isnt so . stockyards converted me for the good, forever .

PS . they only have their big brunch menus on SUNDAYS . SUNDAYS . NOT saturdays . ONLY ON SUNDAYS . NOT SATURDAYS . i went on a saturday . :( secretly, i was a little more super extremely excited about fried poached egg than the chicken . but even so, i wasnt disappointed cuz thats just how good their chicken turned out to be . i'll give them 5 star ignoring this fact but i know when i go on a sunday, i'll love them even more .

PPS . dont be afraid of the sauce that comes w their chicken & waffle . theyre finger licking good !"}
{"text":"They no longer have the butter burger. It was replaced by something called the \"dirty 30\" which has blue cheese, but a weird sort of unappetizing pastiness. Feh. Did not hit the spot and left me feeling disappointed and gross."}
{"text":"\"What can one say about The Stockyards that hasn't been said before, other than it is still great? This was the dinner choice last night. Seating for about 16 at a time, this barn board room is more kitchen than dining. The floor show is always entertaining. Barstools along the wooden bar overlook the grills and fryers and those who man (and lady) them. Who needs the Food Network when you can watch the grill live while you clean your frying pan? Yes, the food is served in skillets. It's kitsch and it works perfectly here.......\"

{"text":"You have to try their fried chicken and waffles!

 It looks small from the outside, but it's actually pretty long! Be careful it's cash-only, but so is every brunch place now-a-days. 

Great service and exceptional decor. Try to get a seat near the window, it's soooo nice!"}
{"text":"3.5 / 5

The stockyard's was sort of a mixed bag for me.

To make things clear right off the bat, the quality of their food is definitely one of the good things about this place.  I got a burger and fries and both were well above what you'd get from most burger places.  The burger was juicy and had a really good unique taste to it, and the fries were crispy and tasty as well, and they gave you a huge amount of them too.  Another really cool thing is that they give you your coke in a glass bottle, not really a huge deal but it's sort of unique considering all you ever see nowadays are plastic bottles.  My meal came out to around $15 in total, nothing too overly expensive for a gourmet burger.

My issues kicked in when dealing with the service of this place.  To begin with, the lineup went all the way outside and we had to wait a good 15 minutes before reaching the cash register.  Normally I wouldn't have an issue with this because other popular burger places like the burger's priest and Holy Chuck also have lineups so I'm used to it.  My problem was the fact that me and my friends had to wait probably another half an hour or so even after making it to the cash register to place our orders, so in essence we spent about 45 minutes total just waiting for our food.  On top of that the girl at the cash register didn't seem very enthusiastic at all and the rest of the staff seemed sort of stressed out or overworked, which may have been why our food took so long.  The inside of the place is decent looking but it's really small so you'll have to bring your food somewhere else to eat.

Overall this place is pretty good but you may be turned off by the wait times and lack of quality service.  A good burger but your best bet is to go to either Holy Chuck or the Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich with rapini and the onion ring tower and the sweet potato fries.  YUM! Something about freshly cooked plain and simple food. It was great! Just go in there knowing whatever you are wearing will smell like bbq. The ventilation in that place sucks. I love the homely feel of the iron skillets and mason jars."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Tenoch being closed last Wednesday (I really had my heart set on satisfying my craving for some Mexican food but had to walk back down St Clair when the lights weren't on and the door was locked), I would probably have missed the chance to check out the offerings at The Stockyards.
I had been meaning to check out this place but have been setting it aside on my \"save the best and reasonable eateries for last\" list.
The Chicken and Waffles is what I usually read about on the reviews here, and having a weakness for that, I ordered the two pieces meal.
The presentation was simple: two moderate sized pieces of golden, crispy friend chicken on a fluffy, non-greasy, round beligium-style waffle. The fried chicken looked like something that your mum or grandma would make from a family recipe. The coating was crispy and went well with the waffles and the chili molasses syrup. The meat was just moist, could be easily cut up.
The flavors and textures of meat, the waffle and the syrup all complimented each other. 
On the other hand, service was somewhat flightly and something to laugh about.
The order was served very quickly which was a thumbs up, but a fork I asked for was given to the wrong customer and when I went to pay for my meal, it took awhile before the person tending the cash register realized that I was waiting for my change.
But the small space and quiet atmosphere makes up for going back there for another late lunch."}
{"text":"I was actually underwhelmed with this place given all the positive reviews. We ordered the burger and the fried chicken. The chicken we thought was a bit dry. The burger was quite good and juicy though. The fries were nothing special. The place was really busy when we went on a friday night, but the line up wasn't too long and we actually got a seat! service was good as well."}
{"text":"I've had take out from the Stockyards a few times now.  It's BBQ good and it's awesome. God damn is it awesome.  Basically everything on the menu is a safe bet, but if you have never been you really need to try the ribs. You reach into a box and pick up a rib and the bone slides out it's so tender. They only make them on full moons or something like that, for reasons I don't know. The food is messy and greasy. I don't know if there is a way to make good BBQ food that isn't. Go here already."}
{"text":"Had the chicken dinner.  Portion wise, very satisfying but found a couple pieces were not fully cooked (but not raw)   A little more time in the oil woulda helped.  Other pieces were dripping in oil, and coulda used a little more time in the basket hanger.  The spicy sauce was tangy and vinegar based.   Overall I gave it 4 out of 5.  Staff is friendly and smiles"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends craving BBQ.  I was dying to try the ribs and my bf really wanted the buttermilk fried chicken.  Too bad neither were available.  We read the reviews and knew it was going to be really busy - so we didn't mind the line up.  The menu is small, but even smaller when they run out of things.  

We were disappointed to hear that the ribs and chicken were sold out by the time we got there, but we thought we'd stay anyway.  What was incredibly frustrating though, is that people after us kept ordering chicken, and we kept seeing it come out of the kitchen.  It seems like they are sold out here and there - you have to place your order at the extra right time.  That annoyed me b/c once we sat down, if they said I would have had to wait a bit longer but could order chicken, I would have said yes.  That's why we came there!  But instead, it was sold out when we were in line, back on the menu, but then sold out again when we sat down, and back on the menu after us.  

The atmosphere was really cool, getting to see all of the food cooked in front of you - we sat at the bar - though disappointing when you see all the food you can't have go by you.  Service was okay, but not great.  But I guess it's too be expected in tight quarters when it's incredibly busy.

My disappointment aside, the brisket and fries that I did eat were delicious.  Lesson learned, plan to have dinner at 4pm and I'll probably get what I want!  The food was so tasty, it's worth coming back to try again."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because of all the hype on here and chowhound.  I should have known better than to fall for the hype.  Burger priest was a let down and that was really hyped up.  When will I learn !!!

Ever seen a store that has tons of people lining up that people have to wait outside?  I see that and I always say to myself 

\"Hey that place must be pretty good, otherwise why would there be so many people there?\"

but then I wonder...

\"Maybe those people are lining up to see what everyone else was lining up about\"

I think in my case, I need to learn not to listen to what people say...

I've been looking for this place for a few days being in the St. Clair W and Bathurst area for a few days.  Anyhow, after missing it twice on two days I found it (I thought this place was on the same side as McDonalds according to what I remembered on google map)

The place is small, we were going to sit in the back of the restaurant but it was too hot today.  It wasn't that hot today 29C, I can only imagine how hot it gets in there when it's a heatwave 33C+

The service was sort of prompt I guess.  After we got a spot at the front we both ordered the home made iced tea (I usually prefer the fake stuff over real brew anytime, but a starbucks shaken iced tea lemonade changed me the other day).  Anyways, the drinks came cold but they were only 3/4 full without any ice.  We didn't like it, the ginger gave it a odd after taste.

I settled for the classic burger combo, while my dining companion got the beef brisket sandwich combo.  Our fries were very crunchy  (dry in the words of my companion).  I was in the mood for dry fries, but the problem is they were also cold.  How they got cold I don't really know or understand because I presumed they made everything fresh on the spot.

My burger was just ok, nothing fancy.  A good burger should stand alone on itself without any bells and whistles or add on's and for me, this burger wasn't the best I'd had.

Companion didn't really like his beef brisket sandwich either.  His fries were not really eaten.  HE had to get a coke to wash down his sandwich over the iced tea.

I'd like to come back and try the fried chicken but I don't think I want to waste more money here.  Meal for two people including 2 iced teas was $33 including tax.  

No thanks"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times over several years and this used to be one of my favourite spots to eat in Toronto. That first time I had the fried chicken with the side of hot sauce and mountain of shoestring fries. The first time my teeth sank into those super juicy and tender ribs that I felt lucky to have since they were only offered three times a week and sold out fairly quickly. The surprising realization that I love fried green tomatoes from my first experience with them in the BAT. All this was topped off with really friendly staff, who were attentive despite how busy it would get, and equally friendly chefs who would chat us up while we ate and they did their magic.

Those days are gone.

I've been back here a couple of times this winter and things have changed for the worse. The white meat pieces of fried chicken have been dry in my last two visits and the brisket isn't as flavourful as it once was. I'd love to go back and compare all the food I had before to it's current state, but there's one thing stopping me from wanting to give any more of my money to this restaurant - the lady at the front.

Not to be mistaken with the energetic one with the positive vibes that has been there for a while now, but rather this lady with glasses (occasionally on her head) that I had never seen working there in years past but have noticed her not greeting guests, not checking in on them during their meal even when it's not busy, not saying \"thanks\" or \"have a nice day\", and just all-round seeming like she doesn't want to be there.

If the post from Tammy T is correct and the place is under new management, I pray that either:
1. she isn't one of them,
2. they get rid of her, or
3. she finds some joy in seeing people show up at this restaurant wanting to eat good food and have a good time, and reciprocates that with some positive energy of her own towards the customers."}
{"text":"Stockyards is AMAZING. Everything on the menu is crave-worthy and incredible, fried chicken and ribs are the best in TO. Worth making a pilgrimage up to St Clair for!! Tiny joint, there's usually a line, but you can always call in for takeout. Love. LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken! Gotta say, it kinda beats white brick kitchen's fried chicken by just a little! Casual place to eat at! Definitely will go back and try their bbq. The ice tea wasn't bad. Really tasted the ginger flavour. Not sure if it's worth $4 though."}
{"text":"This is my dream place.

This is also my dirty little secret.
I send my boyfriend on a mission, every Sunday night to this place.
He drives all the way to St. Clair (we're at King/Spadina), to get me dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing chicken and waffles. The chicken is tender, juicy with the sweet sauce on the waffle, they're a fantastic combination. When I went a while back ago, they had a burger with bone marrow sauce and it was probably one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. It was definitely on the heavy side, but well worth it. Too bad it doesn't seem to be on their menu anymore! There's limited seating as the place is quite small, so coming with a big group may not be a good idea."}
{"text":"WELL. This place rendered me speechless. Good food. Good company. Good presentation. Love the atmosphere. did I mention good food? 
The fries melted away in my mouth. So did the ribs - I don't like ribs at all - but this was great. so were the fries....and SO much fun just watching them cook up the order while sitting on the stool and eating the fruits of their labor.  Nice service. I need to go again. Now would be a good time."}
{"text":"My friend stumbled upon this gem of a joint last week and boy were were satisfied after our meal. It's a tiny place, there is counter seating and a couple bar stools at the window. I think it is meant for takeout and casual stand up and eat type fare. We ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and lemonade (they were out of pulled pork). Scrumptious. They serve the sandwiches in cast iron skillets with checkered paper. The sandwich is marinated in apple juice which gives it its sweet flavour. The pulled chicken is topped with some coleslaw (mayo kind) and served on a fresh bun. The lemonade was also pretty rockin. There was a mint flavour mixed in with the lemons and a bit of sweet, maybe honey. Very refreshing and a nice complement to the pulled chicken. I would totally go back and try some of their other menu items like the hamburger, grilled cheese sandwich or ribs."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was good...but nothing special. We had the 4 piece chicken and waffle and it was very average. I didn't really taste anything different about their chicken. We also tried the burger and it was quite mediocre as well. Not sure what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and ordered the Brisket Tostada and Chicken and Waffles. Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. It's a very casual setting and we sat at the bar counter facing the kitchen. It was fun to watch the different foods being prepped and it gave me ideas what dishes I want to order the next time I visit. I saw they had amazing biscuits and had to take one home because I was too full to eat more. The biscuit was so good. It comes with a lemon butter and berry compote which took it to the next level. Stockyards has amazing comfort food. I can't wait to come back and try the ribs and other menu items!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place I imagine would be featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The fried chicken is legendary, as are many other greasy spoon delights. However, make sure to arrive early, because I have more than once been faced with out-of-stock menu items after 7pm. 

The mint sugar cane lemonade is a must-have accompaniment!"}
{"text":"Where do i begin.... I went here with some family of mine as they saw this restaurant on the show you gotta eat here.

Arrived outside the restaurant at 4:49pm on Sunday and noticed a line forming outside already thought wow this must be good.

When the doors opened at 5pm the crowd rushed in it was like playing a big game of musical chairs and especially fun when having a pregnant wife with you.

Grabbed our seats literally and the waitress zoomed by and gave us the menu and took our drink order. I went for the ribs others went for pulled pork.

Ribs were truly amazing cannot find fault at all.

Service was great.

Would i come back again... Definitely but not sitting in will order take out next time. I dont like the idea of dropping elbows to get a seat.

Whilst in the restaurant noticed two men arguing over who snagged whos seat.

Food is A* though and the owner is clever small restaurant limited seating creates that buzz instead of a large restaurant with empty tables. Not as enticing.

Would have got a 5 but took one away because of the seating aspect"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place!! They probably have only 10 seats in the whole restaurant but the line up is well worth the wait. 

I've only been there once, I ordered their chicken and waffles, and let me tell you that  out of all the places that I've tried in Toronto, this was the best! 
Most of the places that I've tried left me disappointed because the chicken is always flavourless and dry, but The Stockyards definitely know what they're doing. 
The chicken was fried to perfection, juicy and tender. The waffle was soft and fluffy, and the spicy honey sauce that they drizzle over everything still makes my mouth water to this day.

The most wonderful part of this whole experience were the servers. Now, I'm not sure whether or not they were the owners, but the two wonderful women who work there are the most passionate, fun-loving and charismatic people I have ever met. 
Their energy just filled the room, the customers and everyone else that worked there. It was a great atmosphere that you have to experience for yourself!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place today after work since I've read countless positive reviews. I don't fully understand the hype.

The restaurant is small and their table service is at bars lining the perimeter of the public area. There is an open concept stove and fryer with a separate person taking orders and cash at the front.

I ordered the fried chicken dinner which consisted of four pieces of fried chicken, fresh-cut fries and coleslaw. The chicken's spicing was not even among all pieces the first three didn't have a kick at all, the final piece had a bit of heat and had me chugging two glasses of water to put it out (I have a low tolerance of heat/spice so I know it wasn't ALL that spicy). The chicken, however, was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and overall very delicious.

The fries are fried in the open area and it's obvious they use fresh-cut potatoes. They don't overly salt them (salt is mixed in after the frying) and they salt them right in front of you. The coleslaw was the creamy variety which isn't usually my favourite but what really got me with this coleslaw was the overwhelming aroma of one particular spice, maybe dill? That took away from the overall taste.

Staff are quick and friendly. They've got talented and experienced chefs behind the counter doing the cooking.

Price point is high! Although, the portions are a very reasonable size it's still not big enough to justify the $15.80 (after taxes). I may go back one day to try their Sunday brunch but for lunch/dinner I'll go along if one of my friends want to go but I certainly won't be recommending it."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering, crispy fried chicken and skinny fries that are better than McDonalds. I shared the 4 pc dinner + fries with a friend and it was more than enough food ($15 comes with cole slaw and hot sauce).

Staff are super friendly and chatty. There aren't a ton of seats and it gets pretty packed during the lunch rush so TIP: call ahead to pick up your chicken! They mixed up my order but offered me a yummy black cherry soda from the fridge. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"My bf and I both ordered the fried chicken dinner and they came out pretty fast. The pieces of chicken were huge and they had a nice golden brown crust. The skin and the batter were super crispy on the outside and the meat was very juicy and tender on the inside. The flavour kind of reminded me of KFC (which I like) but obviously better quality. We loved it! The only thing I didn't really like were the fries. They were really hard and tough to chew, maybe from too much frying? My boyfriend said it felt like being stabbed in the mouth lol. The coleslaw tasted great and I liked how the celery seed flavour was strong, balancing the greasiness from the chicken and fries"}
{"text":"The Stockyards is a tasty option along the barely moving St. Clair Avenue West. Here are a few good, bad, and indifferent points:

1. The BBQ and the fried chicken are both flavourful and delicious, but are also just a bit too greasy. The chicken and waffles are a signature staple.  The biscuits are true to Southern form. They also brew great coffee.
2. Brunch on Sunday is a good way to get acquainted with the place. The line/wait diminishes around one (the same time pay parking goes into effect).
3. Prices here are reasonable. On the Sunday brunch menu, 4 pieces of chicken on a waffle is 15$. This is the most expensive item. Everything else is cheaper... In the 8-12$ range.
4. Seating is all uncomfortable bar stool counter seating. It is cramped, but not to the point of abject misery.
5. Service is average at best. They do rush you to leave as soon as you are finished. This is NOT the place to catch up with old friends or hang out. It is simply eat and leave.
6. Takeout is available. This may be the best way to approach this place."}
{"text":"I thought I didn't like chicken and waffles.

I was so wrong.

I had just never had them done right, until I went to the Stockyards. 

Go and see for yourself! There will probably be a huge line but it's worth it."}
{"text":"So glad that I found myself in the area on a random Tuesday as the food goal was fall-off-the-bone tender ribs and Stockyards delivered. With words like elusive, sold out and long lines floating around on reviews, I was prepared for a long wait and possibly disappointment.  Luckily, there was no lines, plenty of seats and slabs of ribs on display in the front counter. Sometimes being random has it's perks.

We ordered 1/2 rack of ribs and the chicken fried dinner. The knockout winner was definitely the ribs, although the chicken did put in a bit of a fight.  The ribs come cut up in a pan with tangy hot sauce and bbq sauce in little paper containers on the side. You will be asking for more hot sauce, but the friendly staff will be happy to refill for you. Great portions, four large ribs with plenty of tender meat along with a couple peices of ends thrown in. Really well smoked, not too sweet but delicious even without the sauces. The chicken fried dinner was good also. The skin is lightly battered but crispy while the meat stayed moist and flavorful. The fries were a bit on the soggy side (they weren't freshly fried for us) but we devoured them anyways. A great dinner of meat and fries. 

Moral of the story: come on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Okay - so I haven't been out and about to eat for a while because I don't seem to get out of the house as much (and plus I'm trying to save a few dollars).

I've seen this restaurant on blogTO as one of the best cheap eats in Toronto of 2010.  My friend and I just happened to be in the area and was craving a load full of meat.

The restaurant is a little shop, but turnover was great.  You can sit at the bar or sit away on little stools.  We ordered the following:

1) BACON DIPPED DONUT: Okay - so curiosity was peaked.  I was lucky enough to have the last one.  It was pretty much a donut, glazed on top, with bacon bits on it.  It was okay - not epic or mind-blowing, but I sitll enjoyed it.

2) CUBANO SANDWICH:  It was the special of the day.  Basically ham, pork loin, with a pickle, mustard, garlic, and some other stuff in between two pieces of bread.  I thought it was okay, but a pulled-pork sandwich would've been better.  Sadly, they ran out that day.

3) FRIES: The shoestring fries is definitely one of my favourites that day.  I couldn't stop eating them.

4) FRIED CHICKEN + WAFFLES: My friend ordered this, but I didn't grab any from him.  I'm not a big fan of syrup, but he seemed to really enjoy it.

Would I come back here? Yes.  The food was really delicious, service was awesome, and the turnover was fast!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly..

Took a couple friends here for some chicken and waffles

We ate:
- Chicken and waffles (5/5): I cant even believe...how good.. this was
- Eggs with sausage and biscuit (4/5): Homey and lovely
- Smoked salmon egg sandwich (4/5): Fresh and yummy

I would haul myself up here because it full of FLAVOR!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time the food was sooooooo good. The ribs are absolutely mouthwatering and the fried chicken is perfect! I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"I had their fried chicken dinner. It's really good. The chicken surprising is fresh not frozen as you can taste it. Their batter is very light and the chicken is not oily comparing KFC, Popeyes or Mary Browns. Lightly seasoned to perfection as I'm a light sodium eater. The fries are killer (portion) We also ordered their original burger. As it made fresh not frozen as it light as well.

After leaving the place for a few hours, i felt there was MSG/ a lot of essence used on their food because i need to drink water...... Maybe this is why the food is pretty good.

Sitting is very small and you are unable to take your jackets off as there is no coat hanger or sit are all benches"}
{"text":"I don't give out many 5 stars, but this place deserves 5 stars because it really is as good as it gets for Toronto. As good as it is, it's around a 3-4 star in the south, but that's the south and this is the north. That's not a slam btw, that's a testament to the fact that they can hang in there and run w/ the big dogs.

The Stockyards gets its 5 stars on the strength of the fried chicken alone. It's basically the best in Toronto. Four juicy, crispy pieces, served w/ fries, really good slaw that isn't neon green, hot sauce and ketchup, all in a skillet. The limeade and iced tea both get thumbs up and do well to wash it all down. The burger's good too, but seriously, why are you coming here for burgers when there's bbq and fried chicken to be had? 

Service is good and friendly, and the owner gave us a taste of good things to come which is exciting cuz  this is stuff you can't get in Toronto, cuz it's the north, and not the south. I'd tell you, but then I'd have to wait behind you in line and that goes against everything I believe in.

tl;dr - Get the fried chicken and the bbq. Park close and eat in your car if you can't get a seat."}
{"text":"OMG!  So wonderful -- I tend to come for Brunch -- and if you are a fan of Southern food, you must try the Biscuits and Sausage Gravy!

This is something you normally only get south of the border but it is magnifique!

I have had their sandwiches - the pulled pork, porchetta and brisket have my vote.  To keep it authentic - go with Po' Boy style (slaw on top).

Some day, I have to get there for the ribs.  

So -- summarizing:
- love, love the food
- good food is worth it!
- premises are small - take out is best
- if you do eat in -- the counter works -- but the raft of awesome odours will drive you nuts!  :)

These people have the Southern food thing DOWN!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for months finally went today. Have to say it was so worth the wait. The only problem is seating but we got seats pretty quickly as we went early. We had the Chicken and Waffles, Beef Brisket Sandwich, The Dirty Thirty,  and The Green Chili Pimento Cheese. Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"So I've heard about this place ever since they've opened and just never made it there - until recently. This place is small - like perch-at-the-bar-at-all-seats-in-the-place-small - however, it's worth it. We totally lucked out because there were 2 seats at the bar, so you could watch em cooking up a storm in the open kitchen. We had the chicken and waffles and pulled pork. The chicken is done right - cooked in hot enough oil so that it's not greasy and the consistancy of the breading is melt-in-your-mouth-awesome! We were too stuffed to buy any biscuits to go but we'll grab some next time! Would love it if this place expands - there's definitely a demand for it! Yaay meat! Oh, and Rebecca was our server - she ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I tried chicken, burger, and fries. went there because I heard from people they have both the best fried chicken and the best burger. In my opinion it is probably the best fried chicken and you get more than enough of it with the chicken dinner plate. the burger may not be the best I've had in Toronto but it has got it all right, though you do have to pay quite a bit extra if you want to build it yourself to get some of your own toppings there, probably better to stick with the options they give you which in my opinion ( again) could use more toppings.
finally the frites, up to the standard, and a lot of them, I shared them among two people, hope they don't reduce the amount in the future."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure what I tasted here was the best fried chicken I've ever had in Toronto. If you haven't been here... it's hard to explain. It was the right consistency of buttermilk batter; the fries were doled out in massive portions and crispy but not overly so -- the price was AMAZING -- the fact that they're not paying a ridiculous amount in overhead because they're not many places to sit doesn't deter from the awesome you get from The Stockyards.

If anyone else wants to tell me a fried chicken place that's better, feel free, but this was AMAZING."}
{"text":"SO GOOD.

Not sure if my review makes any difference since everything here is so positive as it is, but this place is great. Amazing chicken and waffles, and the biscuits with sausage gravy are also tasty.

Do yourself a favour and go here!

I want to try their burgers and more of the sides next time I go."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch and it ended up being a bit disappointing. FIrst of all, the seating situation is very cramped and limited. Not really a place you would enjoy eating and chatting with whoever you're with on a Sunday morning. 

It's a complete madhouse in the front with people lining up for seating, people lining up to place to-go orders, and people waiting for their orders, and people just doing nothing at all. 

The food itself was only okay. It's staple sweet fried chicken was very sweet and the waffle was very soft and soggy (no crunch at all!) - not what I'm used to but that may be a preference thing. The butter burger that was recommended was not as gluttonous and flavorful as the waiter had made it sound... something about being coated with bone marrow and soaked in wine.... the star of the brunch was the breakfast sandwich with a runny egg. Delicious!

Seeing as the average wait here on a weekend is probably an hour, I would definitely find other places for my fried chicken fix. Was not that satisfied and felt cramped and uncomfortable..."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in toronto!! The crispy skin and juicy meat was to die for. Too bad I came a little later and could not try their famous chicken and waffle. Next time. We also tried the pulled pork sandwich and that was juicy flavorful and presented very well. They also gave us a basket of fries which was a delight.

The friendly staff were always asking if we loved the food and if everything was ok. They really care about how they represent their business and that's great to see.

Wish that it could've been a little bit more comfortable with the sitting area, but I can't complain, they got us a seat right away.

But back to the main point, the food. Everything in the menu looked so good. That I don't think that you can go wrong with any choice of meal. My girlfriend and myself will definitely be back to try out the rest and get more friend chicken."}
{"text":"This is one excellent joint for Burgers and Brisket, but they have bad customer service, and they they need to coach their front staff at cashier. Food with terrible service means A-OK despite the fact the food is outstanding! 

I've been here twice, once on a weekend and they were so packed, it took 35 minutes to get my order ready to go. 

The second time it was during the week, and the place was not full, I made my order with a clearly disgruntled employee, who made a mistake in my order and had to correct it, took about 25 minutes for order to be ready. 

The person that took my order/screwed order - had no consideration whatsoever, and the second person acted the very same. They did not apologize for the mistake, or the long wait, and never once said Yes, Please, or Thank You!

The staff are not friendly, they never greeted me when i walked in n both occasions, they just stare at you, really uncomfortable. They desperately need to be trained in customer service. 

The chef lady is talented and brilliant. The grilled cheese, brisket, hot-dog, and the Beast (Bis-Mack Burger with Coleslaw) are delicious, but with the trashy customer service, wont try them again.

Food: 9/10
Service 0/10

{"text":"Had the four pc chicken waffle and smoked trout sandwich. 

The deep fried chicken was delicious! Love how it was so crispy on the outside and juicy the meat is!  Def a must get if you love deep fried chicken 

It's a small joint, so go early!"}
{"text":"Went at Sunday just before the mega-rush (Thanks Google!) and so we were seated with 15 minutes, but it was chaos as we left. 

We had chicken and waffles. The chicken - moist, crispy. The waffles were just okay, soft on the outside, soft on the inside. The biggest mistake imho was the amount of syrup / sauce they put on the dish. Ginger mint tea was pretty good. Staff were pretty nice but it was brisk as it was packed. They could clearly do with one more person but employees are expensive and people seemed perfectly happy to wait in line so I see where they're coming from. 

Personally feel Korean style fried chicken tastes better, and if I really wanted waffles to go with it I would just get some toaster waffles or get an waffle iron. 

Overall I wouldn't make a trip out of it, but if you're in the area and it's not mega packed it's worth it. Ask for less sauce on the chicken though."}
{"text":"Dropped by for breakfast and our server had the energy & slang of a Carla Hall type (who I've never liked), but was incredibly hospitable and both our dishes were great, even if the experience was mostly very odd."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed.

Best Pulled Chicken Sandwich in town! C,G&L left a big void when they went out of business (actually, it was before that.) This fills that void. The homemade ginger iced tea is also a rare find."}
{"text":"The food was incredible, loved the decor and sitting at the counter and watching the cooks was fun. Got there at 9am on a Saturday and had no problem getting great seats and food was out in no time. The spicy maple syrup on the chicken and waffles was amazing."}
{"text":"Made a special trek to the Stockyards from the Danforth upon recommendation by a good eater friend of mine. 2 subways and a streetcar later, I was in. 
The staff and the vibe they bring is worth a visit alone. There were a lot of them for a late afternoon Wednesday, at least 6 roaming around in such a tiny place. I'm thinking one was the owner, and the rest were there for a shift change. Still, they all came across as dedicated employees, interested in making up some good, good food.
Ordered a classic with sautéed onions and aged cheddar, which also came with traditional toppings and mayo. 
Place your order, grab a stool and they do the rest: bring me napkins (which you'll need), a fork (?), a metal cup of water and, when ready, your burger. 
Instead of the traditional silver platter most of these burger joints deliver their fare on, these guys offer it with a cast iron skillet.
So I dug it and, since it's a flattop fried burger, it instantly filled the skillet's wax paper line with a combination of liquid toppings and fat. 
This was a good burger. Not a fan of the fried burgers but this one was tops. I will return."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something that was smokey and reminded me of a summer barbecue. Thanks to BlogTO, I found The Stockyards Smokehouse & Larder.

Their food is great, full of flavour and fun to eat. Try their deep fried chicken wings (if you don't mind waiting 15-20 minutes), or their burger combos and wash it down with some Boylan's Cherry Cola. The great part is that you get to see the cooks prepare your meal right in front you. I warn you now, though, the place gets really smokey and hurts your eyes, but it's worth it for the type of meal you're getting. Get there early because the place packs in like sardines."}
{"text":"Finally ventured out here to try the fried chicken. The space has limited seating and seemed busy even on a Thursday night for dine in and take out. I didn't really like sitting in front of mirror but oh well. 

We were attended to quick with glasses of water. I ordered the chicken platter and my boyfriend ordered the burger. The chicken dinner comes with four pieces- a whole chicken, fries and coleslaw. The burger came with the same. Generous amounts of food, probably too much fries for one person to handle. 

The buttermilk chicken was good but what really blew me away was the homemade hot sauce. Perhaps that's why the chicken was good. If I had Popeye's and that hot sauce, I wouldn't know the difference. 

The burger was good as well. Juicy and full of flavour. Can't leave it untouched too long or else it will be soggy and fall apart."}
{"text":"Two piece fried chicken and waffle $12

The sauce - simply amazing. Its sweet, its a bit sour, its light and its totally drinkable.
The fried chicken itself had a very light batter if any at all and was super crispy even though it was drenched in the drinkable sauce. Meat was moist and tender. The waffle was made fresh. Really soft and went well with the sauce. But heck you can put the sauce with anything and it would taste good. 

The inside has some bar stool to enjoy the food but limited seating. Service was friendly however a bit slow but understandable since everything was made fresh. Street parking available or you can take you chances and park by the McDonald's across the street.

Just a note: This place is so good that it was featured on an episode of Diners Drive-ins and Dives. I consider this place a Dive"}
{"text":"Oh my Lord,...
This place has the best fried chicken in Toronto by far! So juicy and crispy and so so perfect. The shop has limited seating, so if you're in a large group,... think takeout.

Also, the fried chicken combo is super American sized, so be hungry, or share.

Anywho, I love this place. Go Stockyards, Go Stockyards, Go Go Go Stockyards!"}
{"text":"Most likely the BEST burger I have had in my short life!!! Undoubtedly the best in Toronto!  The fries were AMAZING! The only downside during our meal was the fried chicken. :( now being from the south (Good Ole Atlanta, Georgia) I wasn't surprised to see some fried chicken that in pictures looked like the real thing giving the location. Unfortunately the chicken was pre-fried, cold, and under cooked. I would have said something but being that my girlfriend is Canadian she shys away from conflict/complaining. It was our first time there so many it was just a one time thing. Also if you claustrophobic you may want to get your order to go because it is packed and in a small area. But through the negative that burger and fries were UNREAL!!!!!!! O_O The service and staff were super friendly and nice. I will definitely go back for the burger and fries and try some other foods."}
{"text":"The staff are super friendly and seem not only passionate about their food, but also about the community they work in.  I used to live near their establishment, and often times would see one of the waitresses chatting up a local shop owner, like she was a close friend or family.  

I've never had a bad meal here.  I find their breakfast to be exceptional.  Chicken and waffles are a must, and the homemade chilli lime maple syrup drizzled on top is out of this world.  Another delicious breakfast option is the breakfast sandwich with the CHICKEN FRIED SOFT BOILD EGG. It's magic.  The trout sandwich is great as well.  It's all great."}
{"text":"Do you want greasy, cheesy, bacon covered goodness that will leave you feeling empty, alone and disgusting? Then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place hit the mark. I'm a big fan of BBQ fare, and I'm slowly making my way through all of the best BBQ places in the city. This may be the best one yet. 

First a note on the establishment itself: as you might have heard, it is very small. They only have 2 bar style tables. We originally came here with 5 people, and 2 left because it was too small to accommodate us all. It was no biggie because it was a nice day and there was a park nearby, so we brought our food there.

Three of us split the ribs, 2 fried chicken dinners, the brisket sandwich, coleslaw and 3 buttermilk biscuits (I know, I know. We were hungry, ok?).

The fried chicken was some of the best I've had in Toronto. Crispy, flavourful skin, juicy chicken, and a generous helping of 4 pieces. What more could you ask for? The fries were also very good; almost as good as fries can get (if you're into the thinner style fries). The coleslaw was about the only thing that wasn't that impressive. We all agreed that it was a bit too sour, and it had a strange taste to it that threw us all off. Also, the coleslaw that came with the fried chicken was packaged in the box along with the chicken and fries, and so by the time we ate it, the coleslaw was pretty warm. Coleslaw should always be served cold.

The ribs are definitely the best I've had in the city so far. Fall off the bone, succulent, well seasoned, and all around just damned good. The BBQ sauce that came with it was nothing short of stellar as well. 

The brisket sandwich was also tasty. I liked how the brisket wasn't killed with sauce. I find many BBQ places hide the quality of their brisket by loading it with too much BBQ sauce. The Stockyards didn't need to do this since the brisket was very tender and flavourful by itself. The bun it was served on was soft and fresh. It was a unique style of bread that you don't see around very often (some sort of sesame style bread), and it added just that extra little bit to an already very good sandwich. 

The buttermilk biscuits were also well done. Soft, moist and with a little sprinkling of salt, it tasted so good that it was easy to forget how calorie-laden it was. 

In summary, very impressive. Other than the coleslaw, everything we ate ranged from very good to stellar. When you order that many things from a restaurant, you're bound to get at least one thing you won't like. The fact that it was one of the least important items didn't detract much from the overall meal. Everything that mattered (all the main courses) were very well done. 

Also, I tried their breakfast sandwich earlier this year, and it is one of the best in the city. I hear their burger is very good too. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Chicken dinner: Large portions, super crunchy outside and juicy inside. It doesn't like fried chicken in other place which is taste nothing inside. The chicken in here also taste great. Definitely worth 17$"}
{"text":"their chicken will blow your mind, but my favourite is their house-cured bacon. their deep-fried poached egg, bacon sandwich on their delicious biscuits are SUBLIME. for sunday brunch, go in groups of 2 or smaller, or be prepared to wait for 2+ hours."}
{"text":"I worked next door at Wychwood Open Door and so got to taste a lot of their offerings. Amazing 5 star service. The female manager of this store is bursting with energy. Just wish the food was as well. I've had burgers, a hot dog, fried chicken and a sandwich from here. Everything was alright. I don't get why though they always had a line-up especially on evenings."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night for dinner and it was quite busy despite it being a week night.  However, table turnover is quite fast and the person taking our order was very quick as well. 

Of course, we had to try a couple of things but here are two notable ones: 

a) The Beast Style burger - The description on the menu says, \"two mustard seared 
patties served w/ secret sauce, caramelized onions, lettuce, american style cheese 
and pickles. 

You have the option to opt for a single patty and if you're considering eating other things on that menu, definitely go for the single because that double was very intense.  Personally, I found this a great burger but I didn't find a \"wow\" factor to it.  Maybe I also didn't eat fast enough - but the bread became quite soggy too.  It is a very messy burger...so either prepare to wash your hands or eat your burger with a knife and fork.  

b) Fried Chicken Dinner - Now this...this was scrumptious.  Probably the best friend chicken I've had in Toronto.  The skin was crisp, well-spiced, and not too salty, and best of all, they were able to retain the juiciness of the chicken.  There was a very generous portion of fries that came with the chicken as well as a generous cup of slaw, both of which were delicious!  

Overall, a great little place!  Definitely worth the wait time - I'll be back again!!!! For sure!"}
{"text":"This place is SOO TASTY! If you want to try the best American style BBQ in the city then you have just hit the JACKPOT! 
I highly recommend the fried chicken dinner it is out of this world. I also recommend the RIBS as they sell out within minutes....people literally line up to get them.

Go early and make sure you try it all."}
{"text":"Second visit here and wait time was about 30mins. Very small restaurant with limited seating, but the food was worth the wait.

Hostess was very friendly to every customer and a bit entertaining to watch as we waited for seats. 

We were seated at the bar infront of the frying station so be prepared to be a little squished and have your clothes infused in fried chicken aroma! 

Dirty bird: crispy chicken smothered in gravy on top of a waffle.
Chicken and waffles: crispy chicken with waffles covered in sweet maple glaze. 
Biscuit: sooo fluffy and buttery, can with orange butter and grape jam which was just the perfect combination- yum!

Only preference I would like differently is the waffles consistency - batter was very dense and had a soft/soggy texture vs a crispier crust and soft interior."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Waited close to 15 at our seats with no one taking our order. Wanted the burger where there was only 30 per day, 3 people sit down next to us and order the last three. Every restaurant I've been to serves people on a first come first serve basis. Guess this place doesn't know proper customer service. Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! My family and I stopped here while on vacation and I'm so glad we did! Everything was so good! Most of us ordered burgers and fries, my mother in law ordered the ribs and I ordered a couple of pieces of fried chicken just to taste.....we ordered the burgers first and my goodness they were amazing!!!! Juicy, seasoned great and buns was grilled just right! The fries had a nice crunch to it and seasoned well. My mother in law really enjoyed her ribs with the dry rub. But let me tell you...... that FRIED CHICKEN WAS EVERYTHING! I was so full by the time the chicken came out so I wanted it to go. The owner said I will give it to you to go as long as you take one bite here.... just taste it.... let's just say I didn't have any left to take home! That was one of the best fried chicken I've ever had..... EVER! Crispy skin, well seasoned and juicy! This is definitely Top 2 best fried chicken I've ever had. Everyone there was so nice and friendly. The owners even took time out to chat with us. This place will always be on our to do list whenever we are in Toronto. You can tell that everyone there has a passion for food and it shows up on the plate!"}
{"text":"Simply Love... Haven't had anything on the menu that I did not like... Fried Chicken, Ribs, Burger, Pulled Pork were all delicious!

Recently had Sunday brunch there and that is a must...

Go! Enjoy! Now!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is the bomb. Fast, pleasant service makes it all worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Price very reasonable I just wished they added more bbq on the menu but what they have is phenomenal the chicken and waffles are dynamite they give you so much for 16 dollars and their ice tea is amazing also their beef brisket sandwich is dynamite with homemade bbq sauce one if the best bbq place in toronto"}
{"text":"I love BBQ.  And all things being honest, i would rather make my own.  But that said, I jump at the opportunity to come here!

All the meat is delicious!  It's not healthy! It's... It's beautiful!"}
{"text":"It hurts my heart to give Stockyards such a low rating.
I would give it five stars, I honestly would.
I LOVE fried chicken with all my heart, and I had heard amazing things about the chicken here.

They didn't disappoint--the chicken was warm, crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. (I had the fried chicken dinner...or something with a similar name.)
It comes with coleslaw (meh, I don't like coleslaw), fries (nice), ketchup (for the fries, of course!) and hot sauce that tasted suspiciously like tapatio.

But I'm sorry. We waited over half an hour for our chicken, because our order was forgotten. A few minutes after we ordered, the woman came by to give us napkins and forks, saying the chicken would come soon. It didn't.
It didn't.
It didn't.
We didn't know what to do--it was pretty busy and we didn't know if we were delayed because of the business or if we were forgotten.

And then it became pretty obvious when the woman walked by, saw us with empty table, and yelled \"I'M MISSING A CHICKEN OVER HERE!!!\" and the girl behind the counter working at the grill said something like \"WHAT? I NEVER GOT THIS ORDER\" or something.

If it were anywhere else, I'd give one star. But I can't bring myself to give such amazing fried chicken one star...
And, like a doof, I would so TOTALLY come back here in a heartbeat.
The things I do for fried chicken so heavenly."}
{"text":"One piece of bacon, a very small egg, a house made biscuit that tasted day old and cheese.
Cold coffee, an annoying server, open at 9am according to signage yet coffee was not brewed.
Server was familiar, has been there since day 1, talks very loudly, left restaurant to go to her apt. to get lettuce.
Came back and proceeded to cook food for herself and for whoever else was working; I only know this because she gave a play by play.
Please, don't refer to me, a 40 something woman,  as \"young lady\".
$15 with tip.
Bravo to the Owner. You are killing it."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life! Would definitely come back again, to try something else from their amazing menu!"}
{"text":"Maybe I hyped it in my head but I came here for chicken and waffles. I got the two piece chicken and it was good but still average. I've had better chicken and waffles elsewhere. The place is small and it can be a long wait if you decide to dine in. We sat along the countertop because we wanted to watch them cook our food. However, the lady making our food looked miserable. I'll probably give this place another chance and try out their other food items."}
{"text":"This ranking is for the burgers only. Not a place to eat a gourmet burger. I haven't tried the smoked ribs or chicken"}
{"text":"There is no better place in the city for southern style buttermilk fried chicken, yet the real star of the show here is the ribs they serve three times a week. The ribs are smoked for 48 hours and come in gigantic portions. Absolutely colossal in size and smoked to perfection. Although sometimes, the fat content can detract from the experience depending on which piece you get. The ribs tend to be dry rub and packed with spices you won't find anywhere else. BBQ sauce is offered on the side if you require a bit more tang. You'd have to have an enormous appetite for finish a full rack of ribs and a side of fries in one sitting, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"I really want to sing the praises of The Stockyards, I really do - because honestly, the food was phenomenal. 

But the service... oh, the service. I have never received such horrible service. Yes, the restaurant was busy, and as such, so was our server, and for that, we tried to exercise patience. My date and I both work in the industry, so we know how it is - but this was completely ridiculous. She was prompt with taking our drink orders, and then quickly brought them over to us - but didn't say a single word when she did and walked away without taking our order. We waited for close to fifteen minutes, at which point we got up from our seats and found her so we could order. The food came promptly, delivered by someone else, and as I said, was great. That said, she never checked on us to ask how the food was. After we finished our meal, with napkins in our skillets, she checked up on the table next to us that had just received their food, and then walked away. We sat with dirty plates in front of us for another ten minutes - a waste, if you ask me, when they had a waiting list of people looking for a spot to eat. Eventually our plates were cleared by another staff member, and we sat awhile longer waiting for our bill.  Eventually we just paid at the front. 

After hearing so many great things about this restaurant, I'm astonished at the experience we had. While we really did love the food, our experience was absolutely ruined by the (lack of) service we received."}
{"text":"Bit of a late review. 
I have been here once to get their famous chicken and waffles. It did not disappoint.  Their fried chicken is just wonderful. Reason I have not been for the second time is due to the fact that you would be waiting awhile to get a table on the weekend. (duh) and I hate listening to my stomach growl. 
As for the food, 5 stars no doubt"}
{"text":"Delicious food
Tried the 4 pc fried chicken and the beast burger
Both were delicious 
The fried chicken is the best I've had so far in Toronto 
The burger was also super juicy, tasty and a perfect bun. Meat was well seasoned and it all worked so well together 
Also had the ice tea and enjoyed it - definitely has a kick of ginger 
Prices were also very reasonable 
Came around 6pm on a Saturday and got a seat right away 
Casual place with delicious food
Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fried chicken and ribs are amazing. Creamy peppery coleslaw is also fine. On the ribs -- you need to be there early! They go quickly. Easily the resto with the best food in the area."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in the city!  Succulent and crispy!  I love the chili syrup that's poured over them.  Waffles are just plain waffles.  Maybe get a little more creative with them?

Though really the best thing here are the biscuits.  I've travelled through the US South a few times.  These biscuits could beat most of the ones I've tried there.  So warm, and buttery!

The wait was a bit long considering it was 2pm when we arrived (I thought they'd be done with the lunch crowd!).  But the food is worth it because the servers were sweet and the food was really tasty."}
{"text":"We had the fried chicken and the pulled pork sandwich.  The chicken was fantastic, very moist and flavourful.  Served with a huge side of fries and a pretty good coleslaw.  4 pieces for 14 bucks makes this an awesome value given the quality.  The pulled pork was equally great.  Everything you want in a good pulled pork sandwich, moist and a big serving.  Again served with a massive side of excellent fries.  This place is a definite must-eat.  Be warned about the crowds though.  They only make what they have for that day, so they were out of both the pulled pork and fried chicken by the time we left at around 8 on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Checked out this place today, I had The Dirty Bird, and my boyfriend has the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Both were absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend this spot for brunch/lunch. Will be going back to check out their dinner menu soon. The staff is fun and outgoing, and they work their asses off! The only downside is the place is a tad small, so the wait time was about 45mins at 1pm on a Sunday. The price point and flavours were worth it though!!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was delicious, just the right amount of BBQ sauce, great bun-to-meat ratio. Fried chicken was very crispy yet moist. Must try spot in toronto! 
Definite return spot"}
{"text":"This place is listed on the top 100 restaurants in Canada for a reason. It is always busy and they run out of food! They probably have the best fried chicken in the city, so do yourself a favour and go there. If it was located more downtown I would go there a lot more often.... but at least the people of St Clair West can benefit from their location."}
{"text":"I've alway wanted to go to this restaurant to try out their famous fried chicken on waffles drenched with maple syrup. I wasn't disappointed! The chicken was spicy, and with the syrupy waffles, made a decadent delish experience. The waitress serving us was very knowledgeable & attentive. I definitely would come back again & try their pulled pork."}
{"text":"Among the many options on St Claire, this is the go to spot for your chicken and burger fix. 

Regulars swear by the burgers as the best in the city, but the fried chicken should not be overlooked. The dinner comes with a mound of fries and a side of coleslaw. The chicken is tender and juicy. This is more than enough for enough for 2, or if you are feeling gluttonous like myself, for 1.....

What makes stockyard unique is the fact that pretty much everything is made from scratch; From the sauces to the biscuits and even the bacon. 

If not for anything else, this is worth the trip just to brighten up your day. The folks at the Stockyard sure know how to put a smile on your face, treating every customer who walks in with the upmost hospitality. 

Keep up the good work my Canadian friends"}
{"text":"3.5* for what I ordered, pumped up for neighbourhood feel, & casual, but friendly/professional service!

\"There's nothing 'DIET' about this menu\", says the guy running the place to a lady who asks for a Diet Coke.  That about sums it up.

Before you all throw stones at me, I do NOT order the fried chicken.  Now, after the fact, reading all these reviews, I probably should've ordered it, would've loved it, and could've given this place a more favourable review.

I came here after OktoberFEAST at Wynchwood Barns got rained out.  So myself and my partner in crime used our trusty Yelp app to find a place nearby.  Since we were both starving, I didn't really have time to skim through the reviews to see what was worth ordering here.

We ordered:

Fries ($5) - Really good!

The Beast Style (single burger $7.50) - It tasted like a Big Mac, with caramelised onions, and a bigger patty.  You do what you will with this info

\"The Castro\" (a.k.a. Cuban sandwich) - contained 2 kinds of pork based cured in-house meats with cheese and some citrus-based flavour.  The 'beige' meat was super, uber fatty.  Not sure if that was on-purpose, but not my thing.

The meat was seasoned, but it needed SOMETHING, perhaps a sauce of some sort.  I really wouldn't recommend that item.

Place has a really nice feel to it!  Guy who was running the joint seemed really cool.  Seating only at bar, no tables.

I guess not ordering the fried chicken gives me an excuse to go back? ;)"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is GOOD. This was a destination for me on our recent trip to Toronto, after reading about it on Serious Eats, and it was definitely worth it.

We came specifically for the burgers, but I would love to go back to try the other delicious looking menu items, particularly the chicken and waffles. We arrived on a Sunday right before they closed (they close for a couple of hours between brunch service and dinner service). We felt very lucky that we were the last party able to place an order! Many people came in after us, but they were all turned away.

We were not able to eat there since they were closing, but we ate at a nearby park and it was no problem. The ladies who run this place are friendly, charming, and very welcoming. They were enjoying themselves and chatting with customers, and everyone was having a good experience. They had actually completely run out of fried chicken (which makes me wish I had the chance to taste it even more!), and they were able to deliver this news to customers with complete grace.

The burgers were fantastic. We had a couple of classic burgers, a beast, and the burger with pimento cheese. The beast totally stole the show, and I recommend you get this if you're in the mood for a burger. The fries were abundant and delicious, and they have ketchup, regular vinegar and malt vinegar for your dipping pleasure.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My friend highly recommended this place because of the chicken n' waffle. And its so disappointing that they only serve it til 3pm! Well we got there at 5ish. Anyhow, service was a little slow and the food that we ordered which was the chicken dinner was a little bit over the average. I would update my review either for better or for worse later on because I wanna give this place a second chance. Toodles!"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and found this place was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives. Happy I made it there. I don't eat fried chicken often and this was delicious. Fresh, crispy coating and really juicy inside. Huge pile of fries with the chicken. As I sat at the \"bar\", I watched people come in one by one to buy ribs to go. And once they're sold out, that's it. So I added a half rack to my order and they were delicious too. Slightly spicy sauce, fall off the bone meat, wow. Just awesome. Washed it down with the house made ginger iced tea. I've only been to Canada once (in 40 years) but if I ever make it back to Toronto, I'll be stopping by the Stockyards."}
{"text":"My friend took me out for my birthday. She asked what was my favourite meal. I thought about it and asked for fried chicken. I have seen this restaurant on the food network, and it got really good reviews.

We walked into the restaurant, and the lady behind the counter was very welcoming. I need to say that this is not your typical restaurant as there are no tables. You sit at the counter. I didn't mind sitting at the counter because I got to watch the gentleman behind the counter cook all the meals. He interacted with his customers while cooking. He smiled the entire time. The lady behind the counter took our order. I told her that I saw this restaurant on television, and I really wanted to try the fried chicken. I got the fried chicken (4 pieces) with waffles. My friend got the butter burger. The chicken was crispy and crunchy yet very moist. The chicken was also seasoned very well. It was garnished with a sweet and hot sauce (but not too spicy. However, my friend can't take any heat, so she found it a little too spicy.) Her burger was very moist. I took a bite. It had blue cheese, sauteed onions, wine, and bone marrow. I will say that it was very rich. Also her fries were fresh cut. It was not frozen.

Overall, I am very happy that I came to this restaurant. I enjoyed my meal. I am going to tell my friends/work colleagues about this restaurant. I would also like to try the brisket next time that I am dining at this restaurant.

Unfortunately, the lady who worked behind the counter is leaving today. She and the cook definitely made the restaurant. I have been to several restaurants where the food was fantastic, but the service was horrible. I only remembered the horrible service. I have been to restaurants where the food was meh...However, the service was fantastic, and we had returned to the restaurant. I can honestly say that the food and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I was here for Burger Week and ordered the burger plus fries as I've heard heard good things about both. 
There were a lot of people here, presumably for the special and seating was packed and available only under reservation which really made no sense as this isn't remotely upscale dining. There were quite a few servers just standing around and a reasonable amount of kitchen workers so it baffles me how long the wait actually was. Amidst the stuffiness and lack of AC, impatience and hunger seriously took over.
I was standing pretty close to the counter and I could hear a couple servers complaining to each other, saying something along the lines of \"never again\" and \"I bet you wish you were somewhere else right now\". It's no picnic for customers to stand for half an hr in the heat either but since the restaurant chose to participate in this event, they needed to keep up with additional demand in a professional manner, which they didn't do successfully. Complain in the privacy of the back rooms, not in front of the patrons unless your intent is to purposely make us uncomfortable...
Onto the actual meal: the fries were nothing special and were actually soggy after I opened the box just 5 minutes upon leaving the place. The burger was kind of small and the patty literally fell apart when I picked it up. 
I really wanted to love this place based on the countless rave reviews but it seems a little less than average to me. A burger, even when bad is still pretty damn good but this just wasn't doing it for me. 
Final verdit?  If it weren't for all the hype I would never have came here and stood for the insane wait. A tad overrated."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time I go, whatever I so happen to order. Brunch is definitely the best-- chicken ginger waffles sound appalling but are phenomenal. Although the atmosphere is nice, be warned that the stockyards is always busy, always packed with people. However, this is to be expected, as this restaurant totally deserves the reputation it has earned. Hearts be eased, they do do take-out."}
{"text":"There's a wait. Sure. The foods great. Yup. But the staff is awesome! From the attitude to the energy to the singing, they made my meal a full experience where I felt like someone who actually cared about me was feeding me. 

I highly recommend this place. It's a great stop when you're craving that chicken and waffles. It has a really warm feeling and if it's a nice day, just get some take out and sit outside on the bench. awesome! thanks guys!"}
{"text":"\"The Dirty 30\" once it touched the lips it felt so good, orgasmic..."}
{"text":"Good stuff: Have been here for brunch and dinner; it's been a brouhaha both times. Despite this, staff are level-headed and jovial, so it's easy to forgive them for occasional slip-ups. 

Better stuff: The homemade \"extras\" like sandwich sauces, jams and ginger iced tea add a lovely touch. But let's face it, we're here for the....

Best stuff: ... MEAT!!! The fried chicken is simply delicious - moist with a spicy/crunchy batter. Pulled pork is slow-cooked stringy goodness. I could eat the bacon and arugula sandwich every day. I probably would, but I'm trying to keep my weight slightly under three hundred pounds. 

No, one can't have a health-concious meal here. But when you're craving chicken n' waffles for breakfast, this is the place to be. 

They do lose a star for a few misses on the menu. The burger is nothing special, and the sausages aren't too exciting either. Also, the gravy looks like vomit. To be fair, it probably tastes really good, but it's hard to visually overcome the chunkiness factor.

Logistics: The place is small and meant to be a takeout service, but unfortunately the chicken and ribs aren't as tasty when re-heated in the oven. If you're planning on eating on-site, be prepared to wait for the goods (especially at brunch). 

Definitely call ahead if you want the ribs... they only have them on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays, and often run out.  

Funds: Brunch for two with coffee, ginger iced tea, tip and takeaway southern biscuits was about forty bucks."}
{"text":"I came here for my last meal in Toronto before heading off to my new home in Shanghai. My dining buddy had convinced me to get the fried chicken which it is known for. And it was amazing. But waaaaay too much. Between the two of us, me with a decent appetite and him a taller than 6' dude, we couldn't have finished one serving, let alone the 2 that we ordered. 

Three things that would make it better:
1. Being licensed. Duh. This greasy deliciousness needs to be washed down with beer.
2. More sitting room.
3. Poutine. How do they not have poutine?? The fries are phenomenal. 

I will probably go there again but only for take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Had the burger and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were incredibly tasty and juicy. If the outstanding food wasn't enough for you, the staff are extremely kind and you can talk to the chef when it's not too busy. The stove and flat top can be seen easily from the counter and there are seats so you can watch while your food is cooked. This place is on my absolute favourite bbq places."}
{"text":"Shady business practice: if you order out they automatically make your meal a combo for $2.50 extra. Should've asked before doing that. Food doesn't taste as good when you take out either."}
{"text":"Third time eating here and always enjoyed. This last time burger was a little over cooked for my liking but good none the less. I have had a better pulled pork but wont complain for one."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said, but I want this gem to maintain its high average rating!  The burgers are delicious, the fries are crispy, and the fried chicken is among the best I've ever had (and I used to live in the south).  All this place needs is beer!"}

{"text":"Perhaps a continual theme of my other reviews, a common thread if you will; stems from the fact that I moved out of Toronto for nearly 7 years and then returned in the Summer of 2015. There were certain locations that I remembered all those years later and re-visited and then there were places like The Stockyards, who I probably went past hundreds of times the first time I lived here, was one of the spots I had heard a lot of really great things about. Last night, my craving for fried chicken finally came to a head and I had to sesiate my hunger. Recalling this place I visted to pick up two friend chicken dinners to go. The cook and current front staff were extremely nice, like visiting old friends. Talking at length about this and that while I waited for my orders, then while I waited for my uber to arrive after snagging two of their amazing biscuits near the check out, the front staff person gave me a free ginger tea on the house while I waited. Now don't assume that is standard :P  I just gave a good tip when I paid for my order and appreciation is a tennis game.

Rant aside, come out and check out the best friend chicken in the city.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  

The Beast Burger has flavour beyond words.  It's that kind of delicious mess that you don't want to end but if it was much bigger,  you'd never finish it.  A plethora of seasoning and piquancy that has your taste buds begging for more.

The Deep Fried Chicken and mountain of Fries makes other fried Chicken places seem like beginners.  We were fortunate to be rewarded with a ramekin of chiliglaze sauce - an in-house special sauce normally served with the Chicken n Waffles... To Die For!!! Amazing to dip the chicken and fries in - WOW!!!

I would absolutely 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone if you're in this neighbourhood and they would even be worth the drive to come across Toronto just to enjoy one of those beast burgers!! 

Another one of Toronto's Hidden Gems!!"}
{"text":"What better person to pop my Stockyards cherry then Mr Yelp Toronto himself Vivek S. I was surprised to find that the eatery was more like a takeout joint with barstools then an actual sit down resto. Luckily, we had no issues getting a decent spot by the wall. 

Our orders were taken swiftly and the food came really quickly. I ordered the fried chicken after hearing raves about it. I found it slightly dry but still tasty. The fries were overly salty and the coleslaw was very mild. I prefer my coleslaw to pack some punch. I found that I had to resort to dipping my food in the equally bland hot sauce to get any major punch of flavour. 
The iced tea was delicious, I almost want to bathe in it because it was that delicious. I couldn't finish all of my food and had to ask twice for a takeout container to bring my extra food home. 

Vivek's burger looked delicious, it prompted much conversation about childhood memories of eating marrow bones at family meals. 

I guess I'm a bit of a bbq skeptic/snob, I will probably be back to try something else but I'm not in a huge hurry."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great American southern cuisine, the Stockyards is the place to go. I had this place on my radar for a while and was finally able to make the trip to the Toronto! I came in with the goal of ordering the chicken and waffles. However, I wasn't aware that they stopped serving this after 3:00pm everyday. What a bummer right!? My server was very sweet and insisted that I order the friend chicken dinner, which came with fries and coke slaw and a sweet spicy chili glaze. I was so happy with the turnout. The fried chicken was so juicy and filled with flavor, and the chili sauce added an extra kick to it. The only downside is that this establishment is very small. It's bar seating only, so not good for people who want to come with groups of 3 or more."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a little bit of a wait, depending on what time of day you go. There are only 18 counter seats but I have always been seated within 20 minutes or so. Be patient because it is WORTH IT! 

A note about the limited seating and service since many of the previous reviews have deducted stars due to this - it is a family style diner and authentic BBQ joint: you come here to embrace all the goodness that comes out of their deep fryers and wood fired cooker, not to sit at a white linen table in the candlelight served by staff in suits. That being said...yes, it is tight in there so be prepared to make friends with all your neighbors and exchange \"mmmms\" and \"omgs\" over the ribs & fried chicken.

The Fried Chicken dinner = $14 = PERFECTION. Brined & marinated for 48 hours, the skin is crispy and the chicken is juicy. This is a MUSTY-TRY when visiting. It is paired perfectly with their Grape soda!

Make sure you come here on a Tuesday, Friday or Sunday evening (after 5pm) if you want to try the ribs. They only offer ribs on these days and again, SO delicious and totally photo op worthy for you Instagrammers #gluttony

Lastly, I was lucky enough to receive good, efficient service. Was it the best and most polite I've ever received? Of course not. But the team there is in good spirits, able to handle takeout orders (a lot of them), while accomodating all the hungry people in the store. What's really worth mentioning is that the owners were working the night of my visit - one took my order and the other brought out my food. They are both incredibly hard working and passionate & proud of the food they produce. I would be too! They seemed so dedicated, clearly experts in this category of food and very deserving of the 5 stars."}
{"text":"ah the Glory.

A friend of mine told me about this place.
I went.
I told my friends.
They told their friends. 
Now other friends tell me about this place like i never knew about.

In all seriousness, if you need meat - this is the place to be. 
Their buttermilk deep fried chicken puts all other deep friend chicken to shame.
Their smoked chicken (if you're lucky enough for it not to be sold out) tastes like pork but white meat.
Their bbq smoke ribs - well i would go to bed with them.

Everything else is also bloody good. Always always get their side day special vegetables becuase its always been great and i've ordered it more than 10 times. 
They don't serve their ginger lemon homemade ice tea anymore, but i've been promised it will come back in the summer - wait for it and buy the damn jug if i were you (although it is a unique taste).

And the best part of it all, i've never spent more than $25 there."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm normally a vegetarian. But, I've read a bunch of great reviews of The Stockyards recently and I've never tried Southern BBQ before so I thought I'd check it out. To ensure a rigorous review I brought along my most carnivorous friend Dan and I've added his comments below.

I had a half rack of ribs and a side of fries for a little under $20, a bit pricey in my opinion. I'll leave comments on the meat to Dan but the fries were awesome -  shoestring style, just salty enough and not at all greasy. The service was quick and the staff were friendly. I really love the space and atmosphere at The Stockyards. We sat at a huge wood counter overlooking the kitchen area, which allowed us to watch all sorts of delicious looking stuff being prepared. All the side dishes being served looked amazing: brussel sprouts, beans, potato salad, and coleslaw. Food is served in cast iron skillets - a nice touch.

Anyhow, over to Dan for a carnivore's opinion:

\"The one major drawback of this joint seems to be their unusual inventory management system.  Flagship dishes, such as BBQ ribs and chicken, are only available three days a week and with questionable availability.  We arrived at 5:40 on a Sunday for ribs that begin serving at 5, and got the second last rack; both ribs and BBQ chicken were sold out by the time the dinner crowd started to arrive.

The food itself is not at all bad.  Their barbecue sauce is quite nice -- tangy but not overpowering, with a strong vinegar flavour.  The ribs are overall very tasty, but not quite as tender as they could be, with the meat pink and fall-apart flakey at the edges but grey in the centre.  Perhaps a longer sojourn in the smoker would be an improvement.  The french fries were excellent, crispy and salty but not unduly greasy.  The pulled pork, which we didn't try, looked lovely, and was properly served in a bun together with the Stockyards' unique and tasty coleslaw, but they could have done better than a convenience store hamburger bun.\""}
{"text":"Dinner at the Stockyards was a highlight of my trip to Toronto. Siting at the counter up close to the flat top and the entrance to the kitchen, I had one of my best meals ever! Sharing the generous portions with friends, I enjoyed the brisket sandwich with crispy, just made fresh green bean salad and real french fries.  By \"real\", I mean the kind cut recently from fresh potatoes rather than pulled from the freezer.  

And when the chef set the fried chicken on the table, I knew I was in heaven.  The coating was crunchy and tasty and the chicken inside moist and tender.  I washed it all down with a delicious ginger drink prepared in house.  

More than anything, we enjoyed the staff.  They were genuine and fun while tending to our every need."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and ribs! My only complaint was that this place doesn't have a lot of seating. But the food was worth siting elbow to elbow to the person next to me. I heard the chicken was really good too but will try that the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"I don't even think there is a need to review this joint because everyone knows what's up!

Been here twice: 1st time eat in 2nd take out

Eat in: I ordered the fried chicken (obviously) lol it was AMAZING!!!!! Fries are great I love shoestring! 
Boyfriend got fried chicken as well, he loved it aswell, thought it was juicy and great chicken. But my boyfriend has some weird thing about eating chicken off the bone he hates seeing the bone while eating. And he doesn't like dark meat too much. So we cook a lot of chicken breast at home and if I cook it with bone I take it off the bone before I put it on his plate. Cause we all know bones= flavour! :)

Great experience but tight squeeze eating in so we said next time we go we'll take out.

2nd experience: take out- 
It was a Sunday I believe and the have rib special so we order 1 rack of ribs soooooo good! Fall off the bone tender, juicy and not saucy (not a big fan of sauce)

I ordered fried chicken again, how can I not when it's that good.

Boyfriend ordered pulled pork sandwich. I tasted some as well and it was Delish!! He still raves about it till this day, I make pulled pork in the slow cooker but doesn't compare to stockyards lol

I got to admit this place is a bit pricy but I feel like its worth it once in a blue moon.  And you get good portions. Haven't been since beginning of last year when I lived over by davenport. But since I'm in the York area now I may need to go back down and check it out again. 

I would recommend anyone to try this place. I would love to try their burgers, I gotta tell myself not to order the fried chicken lol

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What an experience. It first started when I walked in to order takeout. There was one person ahead of me & I was told I would get my food within 20 minutes (I know it's not McDonald's so 20 minutes is not that bad). After those twenty minutes passed I was told multiple times that my food was on its way. I guess it's the norm for them to have walk ins wait 40 minutes while everyone that ordered online/over phone (9 customers in total as I get angrier and angrier) got priority. So I got my food after the long wait, get home and start working on my hunger. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries (I'm a regular rib fest fiend by the way), the fries were wrinkly with absolutely no taste/flavour, my sandwich was dry and not up to par with other pulled pork spots in the city. I left half my food untouched so I will not be making a second visit to The Stockyards."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Easily one of my top favourite places to eat in the city. Yes, it's small, cramped and you may have to wait for a seat; or wait for take-out. But it's worth it.  The staff are efficient and friendly.  Plus, Hello! Wychwood barns is around the corner and it's the perfect picnic spot. 

I EAT/ATE 
I come here once in a while because I'm not in the neighbourhood. Their buttermilk chicken is one of my top five favourite meal s of all time. It's always cooked so perfectly and their fries have just the right amount of flavor. Add some of their homemade limeaid into the mix, and you've got a meal that will incite cravings for months on end. 
Their burger is one of the best in the city. I've had their basic cheeseburger and it was more flavourful than the Priest's and I struggle with which one is better. 

Where they miss: their ribs. I heard the hype and was ready to try and came super early to avoid the line up (unnecessary before 6:30 p.m. on a weekday).  They were a bit dry and lacking flavor for me. I was wishing I got extra BBQ sauce (the sauce was delicious!). 

Overall, their food is a solid 9 out of 10 and I'm excited to try their animal burger, another tasting of the chicken and their brunch.  It's one of those places I continue to go back despite the commute. Added bonus: I get to go shopping at the Joe Fresh on St. Clair on the way. It's one of the best locations in the city and they always have good stock there.  I should try to go BEFORE eating though. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Their milkshake may not bring the boys to the yard, but their buttermilk chicken certainly does (and the girls too!)."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after a photo shoot down the street. I've been here before however I wanted my family to experience it too! 

Mom - Stockyards Fried Chicken Dinner
Dad - Pulled Beef Brisket Sandwich
Sister - Chicken and waffles
Me - Grilled cheese w/ bacon and a side of fries

The hostess/ waitress was really pleasant. I appreciated that she remembered people's name as they were leaving and made it a point to call them by their first name. It shows that it you care for your clientele. 

All the food tasted flavourful! Personally though my grilled cheese was more on the \"wet\" side as in the sourdough bread was not toasted long enough and there was too much onions inside. The fries were not hot on anyone's plate but they were very good regardless. Perhaps maybe one of my favourite fries ever??? Yeah probably. Let's not forget me being me I had a bite of everyone's food and it was delicious. I also appreciate the glass bottles for the carbonated beverages. 

Overall I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A lot of people seem to like this place for their fried chicken. I tried it but thought the chicken to be quite dry. The seasoning was good and quite tasty though.  The waffle was only so-so, kind of hard.  

This place is always packed and there is very limited seating. It is more of a take-out place."}
{"text":"Wow.
The decor is rustic yet well-kept, true testament to the affluent neighbourhood. Love how they serve things in cast-iron pans. Keeps the food hot as I eat and looks neat to boot.
BF had the famous chicken dinner. Crispy and tender.
I had cider braised pork, very flavourful, loved it! Also cooked well and filling with good fries.
A little on the pricey side but probably comes with the area. Can't help to recommend it since Guy Fieri left his mark on the wall. Haha, he's great."}
{"text":"Whatever they focus on making is amazing, from the Burgers, Pulled Pork, Smoked Brisket, Fried Chicken to their amazing Rib nights. Only knocks on this place is they don't have a liquor licence and getting a table some nights is a long wait."}
{"text":"What a neat place. I had been wanting to go to this place after seeing all the great reviews. I ended up going on a Sunday for brunch. The wait was about 15 minutes which is reasonable for a brunch lineup. This place is super tiny, which is not at all what I was expecting but felt very intimate. The servers were very friendly and obviously at home in the place. They were very lively. Food was delicious and I can't wait to go again to have the chicken!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here last night for dinner after hearing plenty about it from friends, and have to say it absolutely lived up to the hype. We decided to split the fried chicken and the brisket sandwich, both of which were great. The cole slaw that came with the chicken was so delicious that I ended up ordering a whole portion just to get more. It was creamy but still had a solid vinegar bite. The chicken was incredibly moist but still crispy outside and every bite was full of flavour. The fries it came with were thin and soft, which is my favourite way to make them. No complaints there. The brisket sandwich was moist and came with more of that wonderful cole slaw on top, and the barbecue sauce was punchy and rich. My only wish here was that it had been a little saucier, but that's totally a matter of personal preference. 

Service was friendly and fast, and they didn't bat and eyelash when we requested a pitcher of water instead of ordering other drinks. I can see it getting really hectic on weekends, so I doubt we'll be trying our luck for brunch anytime soon, but for another early dinner we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The issue with ordering food when you have been starving yourself for this moment since the night before is that you want it all! Plus, I have a habit of always studying the menu the night before, so I had a pretty good idea coming into The Stockyards of what I wanted. According to the online menu, they also sold beignets (otherwise known as fritters or donuts) and since I always like to have something sweet with my savory breakfast, I asked them about the beignets even though I could not find them on the menu. \"I am sorry,\" said the hostess, \"we stopped selling them for about 6 months now.\" What?!!! NO! I had dreamt of  hot, gooey centered, fried beignets all night! You can't do this to me! Well, apparently the chef that used to make them is no longer with them, and no one could make them like her. Talk about a tease! I can only imagine how good they must have been. Sigh.

\"So.....do you have anything sweet,\" I asked. I know what they were thinking, \"do you know how much food you have ordered? Enough for a small army, and STILL you want MORE?\" Well, yeah! I needed something SWEET! \"Sorry,\" said the hostess, \"I can't think of anything sweet.\"

Several minutes later we got the whole 9 yards. Literally.  And wow, we got our food within 5 minutes. Crazy quick! It consisted of fried green tomatoes, bacon, hash browns, sausage patties, refried beans, 2 deep fried poached eggs and a massive buttery biscuit.  My friend and I stared at the food in awe. That is a lot of food! Where do we begin? So we strategized (i.e., he started with the chicken and waffles and I started with the whole 9 yards).  But that is not all folks. As I maneuvered around the food feeling absolutely giddy, the chef put a pancake in front of me and said, \"this is for you.\"  Awwww really? For me? But in all honesty, I was not sure if what I was feeling was appreciation or plain old panic. How am I going to eat ALL this?! Ha! But I am brilliant! Whatever we do not finish, I get to take home. Duh! So I got back to business and attacked the feast.

My friend and I had a great time at The Stockyards. The portions were plentiful, the taste was delicious, but what I will remember the most about this great restaurant was the service. I highly recommend that you pay them a visit. I plan to visit them for lunch next. I heard their burgers and pulled pork sandwiches are amazing and so naturally I need to determine the accuracy of these rumors for myself."}
{"text":"I came to The Stockyards about a year ago, and i was unfortunately in a rush so i couldn't wait for an 1hr long plus, for a bar stool.  Ever since i have been itching to come back, well yesterday that itch was scratched.  We came for their brunch, i have been eating chicken and waffles for years in the states, however most Canadians have never heard of this treat.  This version is quite nouveau, usually the fried chicken is served on a waffle with a plastic package of syrup, not at at the stockyards.  The chicken came and it is honestly one of the best fried chicken i have ever had, the crunch was there, it was moist, and the dredge was very flavourful.  I wish the dish was as good as the chicken, because on its own the chicken is a five.  The waffles need to be the vehicle for the chicken, however they were just flavourless, and somewhat soggy, they needed to be crispier.  There was also way too much sauce, the flavour profile was molasses, chili, and citrus.  the colour was like orange koolaid, and tasted like an Asian sweet chili sauce, definitely didn't taste the molasses, it would have really helped cut the sweetness.  

The seating is very sparse at the stockyards, and be prepared, unless u are lucky enough to grab window seats, or seats overlooking the kitchen  otherwise you are staring at a wall a foot in front of you.  The final nail on the coffin was the service, we waited at least ten minutes after for our meal for the bill, and another waitress had to bring it, ours completely disappeared.

Overall go for the chicken, but avoid going on the Sunday for brunch unless u have time, and you do not mind tight dining quarters."}
{"text":"Had a super satisfying meal here after a long morning and afternoon!

I ordered the butter burger, and my lunchmate the BBQ beef brisket sandwich. We ended up trading because we like the other's sandwich better. The Butter Burger was a bit disappointing because the marrow blue cheese had melted into nothing by the time it reached us and didn't leave much flavour, but it was still yummy enough. The BBQ beef brisket however was super delicious, tender, moist, and flavourful. It really did the trick that day. The homemade iced tea with ginger was also a nice treat: refreshing and a little spicy. 

The place itself is pretty small and cramped, but it offers and pretty intimate dining experience especially if you're eating at the counter. It was fun to watch the boys cook and do their thing. Wait staff are speedy and courteous, if at times a little curt, but a busy place like that needs to be quick. We missed the cut-off time for chicken and waffles but would definitely go back to try it out.

Had a super great meal in a fun place, and the owner's back story (he was a former model!) was a super fun touch to top it off."}
{"text":"The Stockyards food was very disappointing for all the hype that it gets. We went on a Wednesday evening, and had the pulled pork sandwiches. 

Overall, I found the Stockyards and interesting food experience, but for me personally, it was barely average, way overpriced, with extremely slow and not so friendly service. Also, waiting for 30 minutes on a ricketly barstool while cooking heat and smoke blows on me is not a pleasant dining experience. I could handle the stool and smoke for fast food, but it seemed they were processing the take-out orders faster than the eat-ins. 

I'm from Memphis, and grew up eating pulled pork Barbeque and ribs. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with high hopes, and was very dissapointed. 

It seemed that they dumped a extra greasy fat over the meat after it was cooked, which completely ruined the flavor (if there was any!) and texture of the meat. I could barely take two bites! For people looking for a fatty, satisfying sandwich, this might hit the spot. For REAL barbeque, you trim the fat and smoke and spice properly, the flavor is all in the meat.  

$5 for fries, which were nothing special, (could have been bagged from costco!) seemed like a huge rip-off.

Hopefully their ribs etc. taste better. After one $11 sandwich, I\"m not a fan and not returning. True southern barbeque includes friendly service, and beer, neither of which the Stockyards offer."}
{"text":"After a friend raving about the stockyards BBQ on St Clair ave I stopped by today and tried their butter burger. Being as this was my first time trying this place I did not know what to expect. The atmosphere was really nice and the staff was very friendly. I came a little before their scheduled lunch hour and despite that they still made the burger for me. The total cost of the burger after taxes was close to $13 dollars I thought was a little high. When I received my burger to go it came in a paper burger container witch you would get from any burger place when you order to go I was surprised when I was given my order and was not asked what I liked on it. When I opened it up I noticed it just had lettuce and deep fried crunchy onions on it. I was blasted by one of the staff ( in friendly and smiling way ) for requesting ketchup and mustard for the burger. She said no you eat that burger the way it comes your first time and then next time if you want ketchup you can have have it. I tried the burger just the way it comes and omfg without a doubt it is the BEST!!! Burger I have ever had in my life. The burger was so moist from start to finish very nice blue cheese and butter flavour threw out. The crunchy onions playing their own part and helped make this burger sing. I said earlier I thought $13 dollars was a little high for a burger but after trying this it is worth every penny and then some. I will be going back and can't wait to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite and we were not disappointed.  The BAT or blt was freaking awesome.  Thick bacon and the fried tomato and dressing brought it all together.  The fried chicken had a glaze on it that was amazing.  I would highly recommend this place and I would even go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Wow. Finger lickin amazing. $14 two piece chicken and waffles. Every bite was unbelievable. You might have to wait a bit, but it's worth it. Got a very homey feeling. Super casual and chill. 

I need to eat it again asap."}
{"text":"Detoured some ways out to dine here, my partner and I had this restaurant on top of our list for a while. Ordered our meal around 7PM. Hoped to order the fried chicken dinner as well as barbecued ribs, but... womp, womp... barbecue isn't a menu option on Thursdays. 

Ordered the fried chicken dinner between 2 people. You get a 4-piece plate with a more than generous helping of french fries and a side coleslaw salad. The chicken had good flavour and breading and was tender to the bone. The french fries were the best part of the meal... they were well-salted and cooked... however the fries on the dish we were initially served with were obviously out of the fryer for a while, because the server apologized before we had even fully looked over our plate and brought us a freshly cooked side of fries without us even asking. Sadly, the coleslaw was underperforming - easily brought the platter at a 4 down to a 3.5.

We chose a pair of bar stools by the window after being ushered to sit where we pleased. After settling the server came to prepare our cutlery and plates. At this point I noticed she wore strong perfume. It seems we caught them on a less than review-ready day because when she arrived with our food, she spilled ketchup onto the counter in front of us, said \"shit\" out loud, and instead of wiping it clean placed a napkin over the spill (it wasn't a just a smidge either...) and placed the side of coleslaw on top of it. I was famished and ready to dig into the food so I tried not to mind, but when she returned to top up our drinks the smell of her perfume literally overcame the taste of fried chicken in my mouth. I had to pause and put the drumstick down until I could no longer smell/taste her perfume. Wasn't horrible service, wasn't good service either.

The restaurant is small but cozy so you can eat your comfort food in comfort. On top of it being very dimly lit, we did dine in the evening, so we chose the bar counter by the front window by a table lamp so we could see our food. Mirrors, wooden furniture, and all kinds of charming signs make up the store decor, but the point of focus is the exposed kitchen to gawk over while waiting for your order.

In summary, I would not dine here again but my partner says he would. It was an average experience for a just above average plate of chicken."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and they never disappoint.
This time i got the chicken and waffle 4 pcs . I know I cant eat all four but i bring home the two xtra pieces n pop it in the oven when im ready to eat it still as delicious as before.
chicken is seasoned so well n crispy on the outside. I am not a fan of the sauce they use so i just get maple syrup on the side instead but my boyfriend loves it and gets xtra sauce lol
we also always get biscuits to go which are soooo delicious."}
{"text":"My go to chicken and waffles place.. You Should definitely try the biscuit.
The place is small and cozy, but the portions are large and the owner is super friendly! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Stockyards. Food is outstanding! 
The fried chicken is amazing and they give a very generous portion. Their burgers and pulled pork sandwich is great too. Went for brunch today and had the biscuits and gravy, delicious! 
Staff are always friendly and courteous.
You MUST try The Stockyards."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried some take-out from The Stockyards and it had its pros and cons. I ordered the grilled cheese, which I found delicious for the first few bites but it quickly got that rubbery cheese feel and became soggy. On the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork and it was absolutely incredible.

This is definitely a 'MAN FOOD' kind of place, and I've recommended it to those who I know will love it. Also, the portions are not for the faint of heart, so be sure to go with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Went in a couple of weeks back for an early lunch.... the joint was empty but for 2 employees.... took a seat.... ordered pulled beef brisket sandwich with fries.... a goodly amount of food arrived a few minutes later... bbq sauce was heavy with vinegar and yet very sweet.... not a style of sauce that i had hoped for but still tasty.... fries were well cooked .... a good experience but i have had different styles of bbq sauce that i prefer...."}
{"text":"We recently came to Toronto for a wedding. While we were here we tried a lot of the top recommended places to eat while visiting Toronto... to be honest not one was a place that I said I wish we had this at home... UNTIL we came here to the Stockyards!  

Everything we had here was great.  My wife had the chicken and waffles and they were amazing.   I had the brisket sandwich and it was a home run.  I only wish I could go back in time and have all my meals here while we were in Toronto so I could try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Stopped by this place during my brief visit to Toronto, recommended by Yelpers. 

So glad I took the long cab ride up to The Stockyards.
Although it took a while to be seated, and was seated at a small bar-style table facing out the storefront window, the food was amazing and fast!

I ordered the Porchetta Sandwich, which was heaven in my mouth. MUST TRY if you go there. I also got a side of the greens of the day, which was Roasted Brussel Sprouts w/ Sriracha Sauce, SUPER GOOD. Boyfriend got Animal Burger, which wasn't bad either.

GO GO GO GO GO!
I would take the trip up to Toronto just to eat the Porchetta Sandwich again, and maybe try their famed BBQ ribs and brunch menu."}
{"text":"Stockyards introduced me to the joys of on-line food criticism. A neighbourhood joint with a  DIY aesthetic, it's the kind of place I'd walk by a thousand times without notice. Well, I wouldn't notice it if I didn't have a nose (with which to smell sizzling burgers and smokey barbecue), or a laptop (on which I read the near-evangelical reviews of my colleagues). 

Believe the hype.

Recently, an indy magazine proclaimed a new nickname for the City of Toronto. A lame piece of wordplay, it need not be repeated here. Instead, I propose that we live in Brunch City, and I am the Mayor of Brunchkinland (THAT's how you do lame wordplay, junior). As such, I award Stockyards with the Fork to the City for their Southern-style concoctions, fortified with strong coffee. Fluffy biscuits smothered in creamy, sausage-flecked gravy come sided with fried green tomatoes and perfectly runny scrambled eggs. It's a meal that will last you the whole day.  

The tomatoes themselves are worth balancing ones behind on rickety long-legged stools: admirably crunchy and golden on the outside; crisp and almost citrically tart on the inside. I still don't know if their creation requires a special kind of tomato, or any under-ripe thing from the local grocer. If you're a helper yelper and can provide an answer, drop me a line!

I'm sure the smoked ribs and chicken would be great, but they're still not consistently available, and sell out before I get there. Instead, I must content myself with Stockyard's strong contender for the best burger in Toronto. Griddle-smashed rather than flame-broiled, they're ridiculously juicy, served fresh with toppings that range from standard fixings and cheese, to more creative versions. A pimento-cheese laced option is spectacular, especially when the fattyjuicygoodness spills onto accompanying twice-fried shoestring potatoes. Add a tall glass of cool limeade and you're spoilt for anything else. 

Well, almost anything. A giant basket of fried chicken sees half a bird marinated in buttermilk and spices; then floured and deep-fried. Most days it's entirely worth the wait. The chicken's skin fuses with the breading, making for an addictive dinner. Occasionally, the bird's texture is off, as though it sat too long in salt or the buttermilk's enzymes. Kitchen staff may also be a bit free with the salt shaker, but since it's all prepared fresh in front of you, you can ask them to go easy. Easily the best fried chicken I've tried in Toronto. 

What. they serve desserts? I'm sorry-I couldn't eat another bite."}
{"text":"Praise the lord! Because dat chicken is off da chain. 

Okay so, I went here with my cousins for brunch and I split a plate of Chicken & Waffles + Brussel Sprouts with my sister since we were going to have a a huge dinner at a super early time. But anyway, it was honestly the best fried chicken I've ever had.

So, I'm not a fried chicken connoisseur and I am satisfied by Popeyes so if you're on the same page then read on if you are judging me then...well.... fu too. 

I was here once before for their fried chicken dinner and I definitely did not enjoy it as much as I did this time. First of all, I do not like their fries so it's a no-go but man their WAFFLE was delicious. Fluffy and fresh along with the moist, tender, well-seasoned, not-dripping-with-oil chicken, I was sold. But what really tied it all together was that sauce they put on the chicken 'n' waffles. It just made the dish with a tangy and sweet flavor.

Also, the brussel sprouts were delicious as well. Perfectly cooked, but just one minor complaint - it was a bit greasy. But hell, I was having fried chicken already. SPLURGE!

PS: this is a tiny place and you will have to wait in line unless you are lucky. We got there at like 1ish and had to wait like 20-30 mins and after we were done, there was STILL a line up.

Overall: I'd definitely come back when I'm craving dat chicken. NOMNOMNOMNOM"}
{"text":"Here's something for all you confirmed meat-eaters to consider: the whole hog.

What do you get a guy** who can eat so much his jaw starts hurting from chewing before he actually feels full?  If you are his girlfriend, you invite a dozen of his closest friends over to share a 40 pound piglet from the Stockyards.

Fred and I arrived a bit late and the piglet which, with the smoking rack and tray, took up the entire dining room table, looked like it was already mostly consumed.  But that's only because the other carnivores went right for the ribs.  There was plenty of meat to be had.  

I have to admit that it was a bit \"Wild Kingdom\" to see a whole animal splayed out as the people grabbed with their rubber gloved hands at the meat (box of gloves and jug of bbq sauce provided by Tom, the proprietor).  However, once you remind yourself that it is pork, not pig, and crackling, not skin, you get over it and enjoy the fall-off-the-bone tenderness of the meat.  Tom came by later to pick up the rack, stayed for a beer and you really get the passion and enthusiasm he has for his work.  Smoking a whole hog (which takes the better part of a day) must be pretty exciting.

We were lucky to get a tupperware of leftovers (of which there was plenty) and have been assembling our own pulled pork sandwiches for lunch and dinner.

--

Also to add to my compendium of Stockyards reviews, I've since tried \"The Stockyard\" breakfast sandwich.  My previous favourite breakfast sandwich was the one from Tim Horton's mostly because it comes on a biscuit.  The Stockyard kicks its ass to Tuesday.  With a deep fried poached egg (runny yolk!) and a thick slice of bacon, it is a breakfast sandwich to end all breakfast sandwiches and worth every penny of its $6 price tag.  Get an extra biscuit on the side 'cuz you'll want more of it.

{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS NOT ABOUT THE FOOD AT ALL. Because I wouldn't know what the food tastes like. I debated even writing this review at all because it's not about the food but it has to be said. I'll be sending an email to the management as well. Note the date I'm writing this review, because up until today every time I tried to write it I just got mad.

I wish someone had the thought to leave an outgoing message on the voicemail saying they were closed on July 1st. There was NOT a word about this - on their website, on their phone. Just on the door...so you knew once you made the trek there. Who the hell was in charge of that? I was so dissapointed.

I just don't get it. What's the point of having a voicemail service? Of having a website? To get information out there. So let a potential customer know you're closed before they make a 40 minute trip there.

Completely put off from returning there anytime soon.

Update: So it's been about two weeks since I sent the Stockyards an email with about the same comments/concerns as what I wrote in this review. I haven't received a reply and I don't expect to. I work in the restaurant industry (pretty low on the totem pole) but every restaurant I've worked at or been to responds to guests and potential guests. This one doesn't. They're not interested in you if you're not already in their seats, that's a big one for me. Bye Stockyards!"}
{"text":"(3/29/14) We decided to venture from The Falls to Toronto for more sight-seeing. Relying heavily on the GPS since Verizon's cost to use global data is $2.05/MB. Needless to say cellular data was off. We took the QEW and in about 1.5 hours we were there.  We were hungry and in an effort to accommodate my friend (who's less adventurous with food), we landed at The Stockyards. The line was almost out the door.

This is technically a no frills -hole in the wall, but has strong Yelp reviews. You can walk the entire length of the restaurant in less than10 steps. However, the owner has won many awards and since their fried chicken is a big draw, I ordered their chicken & waffle entrée. It was excellent and this is coming from someone who have tried this dish many times. The taste & texture of the chicken plus their Canadian maple glaze had a slight edge on other places.  I asked one of the servers to find out what was in their version of the glaze.  We had to fight the throngs of patrons awaiting tables to settle our bill and get out the door, but enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"Curious to find out what the hype is all about this place.

Nobody greeted us when we walked in. Then later we were told to wait as it was full.
Very limited seating, and loud atmosphere. 
This is more like a take-out place than dine-in. 
After waiting around 30 minutes, we were seated by the kitchen area where there was just enough room to move your arms to eat. 
We ordered their famous Chicken&Waffles, and Biscuits with sausage and gravy.

Chicken&Waffles: it was a disappointment for me as I had a high expectation since that's what they are known for. I didn't like the chili powdering flavour as it was too strong for me. It was just mediocre, and I had better chicken&waffles elsewhere. 

Biscuits with sausage and gravy: I really like the gravy sauce which was very meaty and creamy with a strong flavour of pepper. It went well with the biscuits. 

Service: Understaffed, not attentive. The staff were not friendly, especially the black middle-aged lady that cashed us out. Had some attitude issues. 

I just wanted to know what the hype was all about. 
Not worth it, and probably will not return."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I decided to come here for lunch before heading to the CNE. Probably not the brightest plan since we were so stuffed that we could't eat anything deep fried and extra sugary when we got to the ex, which was extra disappointing (*thumbs down*). On the bright side I did get an amazing burger out of the experience. 

The seating here is very limited and extra stuffy with the added bonus of being super hot inside. Although, the seating was not as comfortable as my liking the general atmosphere was very lively. I loved watching the people do their magic behind the glass preparing all the amazing food. I ordered the classic burger and my friends ordered the pulled pork sammy and the fried chicken dinner. I tried each of theirs and I must say both were absolutely delicious. The definite standout was the fried chicken as it was oh so juicy and oh so crispy. The portion on those bad boys were actually quite large so bring your appetite. Overall, I had a really enjoyable experience but if you're not in the mood for waiting in a long line or having to stand around for seating then this place is definitely not the place for you. BUT with that being said I will visit this place again very soon!"}
{"text":"Don't really fancy the casual atmosphere. The situation is rather messy. Ordered the chicken waffles for take out. Might have tasted better if we had it there but there was no seating available so we went elsewhere to finish it."}
{"text":"3.8 for now; I have for sure to go back to try burgers and chicken!!

Probably better for take out (I went to eat there). BBQ ribs are far better than many of the ones from most of the booths at the rib fest: they are well smoked and spicy (but the BBQ sauce is colder and not genereously brushed on the ribs, thus why I think it is probably better for take out, so you can reheat it with lots of BBQ sauce on them!). Burgers and sandwiches are probably also good - they look so (but you will need your big bottle of coke or beer to swallow all of these relatively dry items). French fries are very good; coleslaw is good (but creamy for those who don't like creamy things).

staff is nice and efficient.

still... meat is not falling from the ribs and does not melt in your mouth, full of qnd moisted by BBQ sauce (BBQ Dallas in New York remains my number one, then Baton Rouge, then Jack Daniels ribs at the rib fest).

IMPORTANT update: now ribs at Camp 31 and Bibb's at ribfest are much better than there with perfect fall-of-the-bone meat!"}

Get the BAT and have them add a fried egg on top

Can't decide between which form of pig to get on The Stockyard? Ask for all of them

{"text":"Rich and testy food. Be warned, it is a heart-attack on a plate, but then again, you only live once.  The jalapeno burger is very good as are the fried chicken and the ribs.  Unfortunately, some things on the menu are only offered on specific days, and even then they are often sold out."}

Food: the fried chicken was tender and filling. It was fried just right. The sauce definitely added to the flavour. 

Ambience: casual and staff was super friendly and happy. 

Staff: definitely good vibe and chemistry among staff working there. They were joking with each other and kept the environment light and friendly. I arrived 5 mins to closing, and they accommodated me without hesitation/question. This is true business. 

Overall: impressive chicken and a pleasant experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"yery good food , Yes it will be busy and might feel cramped at times but the food is awsome!"}
{"text":"I know i'm super late to the party BUT! I have actually been making this fried chicken from the recipe that the Toronto Star published a couple of years back (google it). I advertise my fried chicken making abilities on OkCupid, between that and my milk shakes, I bring a LOT of boys to my yard. This is the Stockyards, I am the Stackedyards!  Yaaaas, this Double D bitch sizzles that chicken to perfection, moist on the inside, crispy on the outside.

Btw, the recipe is actually easier to make than you think but it's time consuming what with the brining process. And the only scary part is getting the oil the right temperature. There's something else but I like to have my secrets,

I've been dying to try the original to see if mine \"stacks\" up but I'm never in that neck of the woods, except for today. I had a job interview near Yorkdale which went very badly, thank you  very much. I felt like I was being interrogated with rhetorical questions by a tiny, ugly Russian man: \"What do you know?\" He kept saying over and over. I don't..... know.....anything.....I got that dry mouth thing happening, all I knew is I needed to fly out of there and get out of those panty hose and into sweatpants. There were cops blocking the highway though, so I took the scenic route down Dufferin and across St. Clair,  which how I remembered my life's vow to try Stockyards fried chicken.

So yes. I am thrilled to tell you: MINE IS AS GOOD! And this really and truly is the best fried chicken ever. Nice winning touch here: the hot sauce dip! smart thin fries (as opposed to my dumb fat fries), and a lil bit of vinegary coleslaw to cleanse the palate. But! my coleslaw is better, it is creamy, as all good things should be."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place after hearing all the good feedback. One thing to note is that I am not a huge fried chicken fan - or chicken fan (crazy, right?), but putting that bias aside, I still felt the meal here was just ok.

We arrived around 5pm, after hearing that there is minimal seating and the place can get quite busy. Even with our early dinner time, the place was already packed and the wait time for a table of four was one hour. Wondering if we should just leave, the server kindly mentioned that she could take our number down and call us when our table opened up so that we could go grab a drink nearby (love when restaurants offer this!). So we went across the street for a beer and 45 minutes later we got a call saying our table would be ready in 15 (not bad - exactly one hour, as estimated). 

We were seated on the bar style stools right in front of where the food was being prepped. A little uncomfortable (the stool were heavy and boxy, made of wood, so hard to maneuver, and not the greatest to sit on), but the counter space was quite large. However, the stools also had no backs so nowhere to hang your bag/jacket! The floor was pretty dirty with pieces of fallen chicken, so all of our gear ended up on our laps. Made for an awkward meal to say the least. I get that this is not really a sit down place, but something as simple as installing bag hooks under the counter would really make a world of difference.

Between the four of us, we ordered two of the fried chicken meals to share and one pulled pork sandwich for the table, just so we could have a taste of something else on the menu. The two chicken meals were more than enough, and we sadly had a lot leftover.

The pulled pork sandwich - amazing smoky flavor and good quality meat. Piled high and with some slaw in the sandwich, it was a dish I would definitely order again. Only con was that it was a tad dry and could have used more sauce...pulled pork sandwiches should be dripping with sauce :)

Fried chicken - came with four pieces of chicken and a ton of thin cut fries. Chicken was alright. A little under seasoned (thankfully it came with a side of hot sauce, which was much needed) and the meat was a bit dry. The batter was a good consistency, but it really lacked a good, savory flavor. Fries were amazing - thin and fresh and salty. I ended up wishing I skipped the chicken so I could have eaten more fries. 

Price per person worked out really cheap and we left stuffed, with a lot of fries still sitting on the table. Great value for the money but food was meh. I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again, and if I return, I will likely stick with one of their sandwiches and fries and skip the chicken."}
{"text":"3.5/5

The pulled pork sammy was sweet, smokey and savoury with a hint of vinegar coming from the slaw. The tenderness of the meat and crunchiness of the slaw created a nice contrast of textures and flavours that played harmonically off each other. 

The fried chicken is a colossal meal, definitely a two person job. Four pieces of chicken served on a bed of fries capturing the grease. The chicken was moist, with a light coating and minimal seasoning. I can appreciate the detail-oriented approach taken to cook the chicken but I couldn't exactly find the wow factor in terms of flavour. The fries were abundant but underwhelming. The coleslaw was very nicely done. 

The frantic take-outers buzzing around the cash made the checkout painfully slow. When I binge eat, I would like nothing better than take my deep guilt and shame and leave the scene as quick as possible. I don't like waiting, wandering around, looking for people who would take my money."}
{"text":"I need to come back and try a dine-in experience here. Or at least next time not spend an eternity at the LCBO trying to figure out which beer will pair best with my greasy food while my food sits on a counter waiting for me!!! AHHHH

Okay so as party to toronto life's burger challenge this ranked #3 on the list. We decided to order 3 different burger and split them evenly amongst three of us. We ordered the classic, the butter burger and the beast burger. 

The beast burger - our fave out of all of them. Love the mustard and the cheese. By far the bets out of all of them.

The classic - boooooring. cant see how this could be #3. It was exactly like The priest except the priest kicks its ass with the option! 

the butter burger - ughhh this thing was not....read NOT good. it was super greasy and oily. and i did not taste any bone barrow anywhere on that thing. I was expecting a delicious masterpiece as other yelpers have nearly orgasm-ed over it... not here. not for me. or any of us.

We also ordered 2 orders of the fried chicken. It came with an abundant portion of fries and coleslaw (aka. SOULslaw). This slaw was AMAZING. best slaw in life. So bloody good. the fries wer eokay but became addicting after i went into a  fried food zombie state. The chicken was amazing. BUT it wasnt a shot as i wanted. Next time ill dine in for it. But regardless, moist, perfect batter, crispy crunchy skin! Awesome!!! 

Cant wait to come back for brunch!!"}
{"text":"ordered 7 buttermilk chicken dinners (shared with friends ofcourse) over the weekend and it def lived up to all the fried chicken hype. chicken was so very tender on the inside. The crispy skin was well still very crispy even though i didnt get a chance to eat it for an hour after picking it up. such a contrast from KFC and popeyes where they plow the sodium on to enhance that flavour. This place is is worth the trek if craving quality fried chicken. Service was very friendly as well. The building is quite narrow and the sign is small so it can be easily missed."}
{"text":"As much as Stockyards is billed as a barbecue place, I really have no idea what their barbecue's like.  I came here because I heard they have the best fried chicken in Toronto and to that end they did not disappoint.  

Fourteen bucks gets you four pieces of juicy chicken brined to perfection, seasoned, lightly battered, and fried to a perfect crisp.  The chicken barely carries a hint of grease, the skin a mouthwatering pane of cracks-in-your mouth deliciousness.  It flakes off the tender flesh in big salty chunks as you manhandle each breast, thigh, and drumstick, crunchy and crumbly and oh sweet god why am I not eating it RIGHT THE HELL NOW?  ;_;

The fries are a perfect match, and you'll be given enough of them to choke a small draft animal to death.  The coleslaw's flavorful, fresh, and light, cutting through the heft of the rest of the meal with a vinegary bite and a bit of added flavor from caraway seeds.  I could eat it by the bowlful, and since it's available as a giant side order in addition to the small bit that comes with every order of fried chicken I occasionally do.   Be aware that the sides here are ridiculous - it's like coleslaw for a small family of people who really, really like coleslaw.

The barbecue's probably very solid.  The burgers look pretty good.  I hear the brunch is inspired.  One day I may try them when I get tired of the fried chicken, which I'm sure will happen eventually.

...Probably shortly after I grow tired of breathing.

Best fried chicken in Toronto.  Bar none."}
{"text":"Is more praise for stockyards really needed? Possible not. But since I was lucky enough to enjoy breakfast there just a few days ago, I thought i would write my review about that. Let me preface the breakfast review with a quick rundown of their menu.

1- Fried Chicken- Its great, its just as good as any fried chicken joint in the US
2- Beef brisket - best ive ever had
3 - Fries - top 5 in the city
4- Porchetta - unreal sandwich
5- pulled pork (i am not a pulled pork fan at all, but friends that are love it)
6 - Pastrami- this is a toss up, the meat itself is unbelievable, just simply the best in the city and rivals schwartzs of montreal which is the best in the world, but unfortunately (and i will be bringing this up on my next visit) the rye bread they use is second tier. 
7- burger- you actually cant put it down, i tried, couldnt do it

Now on to breakfast - 
I was having trouble deciding between eggs tommy (Deep fried poached eggs on a fresh baked buttermilk biscuit with andouile and shrimp lightly drenched in fresh hollondaise) OR the corned beef hash (cant explain it, it is just heavenly).  
The lady (co-owner) offered me the best of both worlds, I got the eggs tommy with a side of the hash. Let me tell you, this was the best breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. This was better then brunch at the four seasons, this was better then jinky's in santa monica, this was everything breakfast was meant to be. Deep fried poached eggs are gods gift to man. 

To summarize, Stockyards is God's gift to Toronto. He has graced us with 2 of the kindest and hardest working and creative individuals I have ever met."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I do love the food but really wish this place was bigger!!

I first went on an evening and got a seat after about a 20 min wait.  I ordered the beef brisket which was tender and amazing.  The next time I went was for brunch on a Sunday and the line-up was out the door.  I ended up getting the chicken and waffles to go and it was pretty delicious but I wouldve enjoyed it more sitting down and eating it in the resto and not on a park bench lol

Great food here but real pain trying to get a comfy spot to sit!

Friendly staff though :)"}
{"text":"CHICKEN AND WAFFLES?!$*#($&*#($&

It has been a whole week since I tried it.. so let me read you the text history while I excitedly told my friend Jamaican friend, Kurt, about it: 

me: I found a place with chicken and waffles!
K: sickk i've been there .. only had their fried chicken which was amazing. Gotta go back for   the chicken and waffles 
me: *sends picture*
K: ur eating it now?! How is it?!?!?!
me: I close my eyes to savor the moment of each bite
       The maple glaze soaked right into the crispy battered chicken 
       the juice of the dark meat exploding in your mouth......
K: You got BACON with that too?!
Me: Smiley face** Yup ! Go big or go home!

That pretty  much sums up my experience :D"}
{"text":"Though I am not a vegetarian, I am not really a person that eat a lot of meat and I am not crazy about greasy food. So this is personal for me to give Stockyards a 2.5-3 stars.

I do love the Ribs! I am glad that I came on the day they serves them. They are nicely flavoured, juicy and fall of the bone tender. One of the best ribs I have. 

The Fried Chicken on the other hand is a disappointment. I found it really greasy.. when I look at the bottom of the takeout box and see grease floating in it.. I am going to talk about cholestrol, saturated fat and calories any time. For the taste, it does not really worth it.

Pull Pork Sandwich though a little dry but it goes really well with the coleslaw. I really like the coleslaw, a little crunchy, a little bitter and not drown in mayonnaise and the only healthy option we ordered.

It will be nice if they will provide some sort of utensils not just napkins with our takeout. Though the food can be finger linking good, the coleslaw with the fried chicken does prove to be a challenge to eat with bare hands.

Stockyards is a great restaurant for meat eater, so go ahead and have a good time if you are one. For me, when I know how long and how hard for me to get rid of those fat and grease I just consume, it will not be some place I will visit regularly or be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"The Stockyards has been one of my longtime favourites. Excellent fried chicken and one of the best brunches in the city, including maybe the only biscuit that's better than it's neighbour Emma's Country Kitchen.

It also has an underrated burger menu. Stockyards was one of the original spots in Toronto's burger trend (along with Burger's Pries etc.) and is still going strong. I was in last week for the green chili pimento burger and it was awesome. Lots of beef flavour in the patty (which was not overcooked) and the chili pimento gives some nice kick. The fries on the side were on point as well: thin, crispy, flavourful.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"When my fried-chicken loving friend asked \"If you don't like popeyes, what IS good chicken?\" I knew where we had to visit. The Stockyards delivered some fantastic fries and chicken, but little else.

Let's start with the good! That chicken. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. I was also blown away by the fantastic fries! I have made and eaten a lot of fried potatoes and these some of the best I've been served. And oh boy do they serve a lot of 'em! They're even great reheated.

Then there were the disappointments. The menu restrictions are annoying. Ribs are only served Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday after 5 while the waffles are only available before 3. Stuck going for a Thursday night birthday, we ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich and the Dirty Thirty burger. The pork was average in being both bland and dry, and the burger was ...forgettable. They felt like menu fillers for days rib aren't served.

Then there were the little things that led to 3 stars. It's a small space with bar seats and no tables (bad for groups), no liquor licence, the blunt and unwelcoming service, and paying at the cash with very high tip percentages (this is a diner, I'm not about to tip 40%). 

I liked our experience at The Stockyards and I'm so glad they delivered on the fried chicken. I will probably be back for brunch or ribs, however I'm not in a rush to get there."}
{"text":"Good food, limited seating. Expand. Please! I need more of that fried chicken!"}
{"text":"They didn't have any fried chicken and waffles for breakfast when I went but suggested the 'Stockyards' sandwich with in house cured bacon and in house made sausage. Yum yum and yum again!!

{"text":"Amazing staff. Really friendly and considering I had two children with me Under the age of 9, the staff made sure the kids were entertained. 

The food was great.  I was a little disappointed that the ribs weren't on the menu for a Saturday night, but overall, the experience was fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place! The ribs and whole chicken are sensational, unfortunately they are only available on specific days. The burgers are as advertised, one of the best in the city. But, it seems like every time I go and the ribs or whole chicken are not on the menu, I can't help myself from ordering the fried chicken! The prices are quite high here, and the $14 price tag for four mouthwatering pieces of chicken, huge amount of great fries, coleslaw and yummy hot sauce, best deal in the house."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I traveled from the US. We found stockyards online from the good yelp reviews and wanted to try it since it was close to the activities we were doing that day - casa Loma and ROM. We decided to park at the pay station across the street. We had no problem finding parking around 530 on a Friday. When we entered we decided to sit at the \"bar\" or countertop. We were greeted by so many different workers who were so welcoming. We both really wanted to try the fried chicken platter so we did and it was the. Eat fried chicken I ever had! Yum!! One of the workers, Connor, recognized a band logo on my boyfriends shirt and they realized they had similar music interests. They talked about venues and bands which was really nice and comforting. The customer service there was outstanding! We decided to order another order of their fries to go to have at our hotel; and then the guys through in an extra order of ribs for free! We were stunned! Thank you to all the kind workers at this restaurant! You made our first night in Toronto very memorable!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. Just go!"}
{"text":"The staff was very accommodating in giving me exactly what I asked for (a very specific choice of dark meat chicken and fatty, not overcooked ribs.)

The staff was pleasant and helpful in going back and selecting another rack of ribs for me when I remembered to ask them for ribs that had NOT been sliced into individual pieces (because I've found at other places that the ribs dry out by the time you get them home if they are all divided up.)

The ribs were amount the juiciest I've had anywhere, and the chicken was about the moistest I've every had anywhere.

This really is great bbq with great service.

I look forward to trying more.

My only complaint was the bbq sauce was kinda average."}
{"text":"The Stockyards has gained the reputation of being one of the best places in Toronto for fried chicken. It is a modest size restaurant offering comfort food on St.Clair West. I came here for dinner on a Thursday to try out their ribs and chicken combo. However, I completely forgot that they only serve BBQ ribs three days a week (Tues, Fri and Sat). The reason for this is because \"the smoking process of their wood fired cooker takes up to 18 hrs\". 

Eventually, I opted for the popular Stockyards Fried Chicken Dinner ($14.00). The dinner came with four pieces of buttermilk marinated chicken and served with fries, coleslaw and hot sauce. The buttermilk that the chicken was marinated in made the chicken quite tender. Overall, all four pieces of fried chicken were succulent, moist, and tasted delicious when dipped into the provided hot sauce. I also liked the shoestring fries which wasn't overly oily. 

The Stockyards' decor is pretty minimalistic with an open kitchen concept. If you're lucky enough to be seated in the bar area facing the kitchen; you can watch the chefs make your food. As for their service, I thought that it was quick and efficient. My friend and I were quickly seated, and our waitress took our food and drink orders. Occasionally, she came back from time to time to our seated area and asked how we were doing."}
{"text":"The pimento cheese burger lived up to the hype. One of torontos best. The fried chicken was unreal, fall off the bone good. Staff were friendly and accommodating to our group of 6 and somehow got us seats together. Will be back to try the ribs. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Being squooshed in the front of a store like 16 year olds in general admission at a Motley Crue concert doesn't really appeal to me.

I see this place often from the street car and it is always packed with people standing at the front.  So I walked in at 2pm on a Saturday to try the pulled pork sandwich.  All the seats are occupied, can't eat in.  \"Sorry, we're out of pulled pork, would you like to try our pulled chicken\".  \"Eh, ok\".  The pulled chicken sandwich was fine - at $9.04 including tax for a take-out sandwich, it better be.

I noticed one of the staff, very politely I may add, asking people sitting at the benches at the front if they could move so that people eating in could sit there.

Look, I want to like this place and I will definitely return one day to try the at once horrible-yet-delicious sounding fried chicken and waffles (together at last!).  I just think they should pay attention to the fact that just because you can squeeze in a few stools doesn't make you a restaurant - clear out the front of the store so people taking out have a place to stand while waiting 17 minutes for their sandwich.  It would make me much more likely to go there on a Friday or Saturday night to pick up something for dinner.

Recommendation - call ahead and take out."}
{"text":"Two words, fried chicken!! Seriously good. Interior is intimate(ok it's small and tight) but the food makes up for it. Super friendly service."}
{"text":"I can't eat anything at this joint. The food is totally garbage. Everything is filled with sugar."}
{"text":"Add another upraised thumb to the chorus saluting this meaty joint. Just writing this is virtually filling my nostrils with the smell of their crispy fried chicken. Three of us snagged a window seat and split the buttermilk fried chicken, the pulled pork and slaw sammich and the apple and bacon grilled cheese. Mm.

The fried chicken was unlike any I had ever tasted, so crispy and flavourful. And the pulled pork served with coleslaw on a \"store bought bun\" is awe inspiring. I wasn't as big a fan of the grilled cheese, which tasted very heavy to me. But combined with a mountain of delicious fries, it didn't matter much: we were completely stuffed.

The homemade mint-infused limeade is a charming touch, and served with real paper straws lined with wax. Neat!

I can't wait to come back.

Obligatory Title Pun: I want to devour the menu here: lock, STOCK, and barrel.

Menu Readability: Helvetica and Helvetica Neue? That's worth a whole star right there.

Need to mention: Seating is impossible here. I recommend take out.

What this place teaches me about myself: I went my entire life not realizing that bendy straws are an innovation."}
{"text":"I went, I ate, it was okay. 

So, the food was probably a 4 out of 5.  I had the chicken and waffles which was absolutely delicious. The chicken was on point and the waffle was good too. I also had some special ginger iced tea, which was out of this world. My partner ordered an entree that was supposed to come with bacon, which they served us without. When asked about that, they said that the type of bacon they normally use for that dish had run out. They did give us a side of bacon after we enquired but that just rubbed me the wrong way. 

The woman working the cash can be very loud and somewhat obnoxious.  That's obviously just her personality but it can be a deterrent. 

Very cute interior. I love the decor and the diner-like setup of the place. It does get very busy and cluttered so don't expect a spotless restaurant. 

Not the first place on my list to revisit but I wouldn't shoot it down if suggested by a friend."}
{"text":"Small but cute place where you can watch your meal being prepared on the flat top. The workers here are super friendly and awesome people. We had the fried chicken meal which came with 4 pieces of chicken and a load of fries which was crispy and the sauce was flavourful - this could be enough for two people or takeaway if needed. We also got the mustard burger which was one of the best burgers both of us had ever tasted - a delicious flavoured and still juicy patty with fresh toppings-amazing! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Service:
The servers were fast in taking down your name and cleaning up the tables. If you are heading up during the weekend, be prepared to wait as the place is small.

Ambiance:
It has the retro hipster kind of decor which is really nice and matches the area its in. I wouldn't recommend going in a big group, as there are only bar seating. Having a conversation would be difficult in a big group, 2-3 people is the optimal.

Food:
My friends were all talking about Stockyards is the place to go for brunch, and it didn't disappoint! I ordered the \"Dirty Bird\", and it basically takes original waffles and chicken to another level! The fried chicken was crispy and the waffles was fluffy, but cream sauce with sausage and bacon in it sealed the deal. The portion was also enormous for my appetite, so I would suggest sharing it if you have a smaller appetite."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised. All the food was delicious and we didn't have a very long wait. Chicken and waffles are probably the best in Toronto. The burger was fantastic. Great southern barbecue / comfort style restaurant. We came with a group of 5 of us and everyone was very pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"I had Sunday dinner at Stockyards and it was so good!  For 2 of us we ordered the fried chicken dinner and pulled pork sandwich.  The fried chicken was moist with a crunchy outer layer. The fries were crispy and complemented the main dish very well. Don't forget to ask for garlic aioli sauce for the fries, you will not be disappointed. Portion wise the fried chicken dinner is enough for 2 people. We were so full that we couldn't even take a bite of the sandwich and had to take it home."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and we thought the vibe was rad. It wasn't fancy but just a cool spot you can walk in to, grab some good chicken or a pulled pork sandwich which is what I had. It was so flavourful and probably some of the best pulled pork i've had. The portion was just right for the $$. I loved the coleslaw too. The waitress is amazing. She runs around helping each and every person with such respect even though it's busy! The owner noticed my boyfriend didn't finish his chicken and personally came up to him and asked him if everything was okay even though he was in the kitchen cooking up a storm! The chicken was perfect, the portion size was just so big we needed a doggy bag =) How often do you see the owner of a joint take care of their customers this well? I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Buttermilk Fried Chicken:  Mmmmm!  Most people will not finish an order on their own, so be prepared to share!  Be advised - it's soo good you probably won't want to!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, but only got in once. Yes, getting in The Stockyards is like going to the Roxbury - where you are lucky not to wait in line. Yet, you must keep your inner Steve and Doug Butabi, and stay in line, because the wait is worth the while. 

I'm from the hood, so you could catch me outside of Popeye's eating chicken and fries. But, The Stockyards change my view on life. I now live in Parkdale, dress at Gap, and left a Leshaniqua for a Natasha."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is one of my favorites. Their fried chicken dinner is a standout, but I've been delighted by pretty much everything I've eaten here. I wish there was more seating because long waits can often be an issue. The wait is absolutely worth it. Its a blessing and a curse that I live about an hour away."}
{"text":"Place is legit. Closest thing to eating Bbq joints from the south USA. Buttermilk chicken is the best bang for the price tag. Showed up at 6:30pm on saturday and had a table within a half hour. 

FYI: Ribs are on tues, fri and sunday at 5pm and are usually sold out within 3 hours. It's a dry rub, which is how ribs should be done. Best BBQ in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is so unorganized and let me tell you why!

At first, there was a line up and no one to tell us where to go since this was the first time we arrived mid morning and there was a line up. 

When the lady at the cash register deliberately screamed at us and told us, \"folks, you don't know what you're doing\". We questioned whether we should stay.

We stayed and we had the Waffle Fried Chicken and some chicken on the lunch menu. These were great! We loved it!

Just not the service. I would steer clear of the lady at the cash register."}
{"text":"From out of town. Picked this little place because it had way too many reviews!!

Holy crap! So freaking awesome for a hole in the wall little place. Their fried chicken platter is generous with fries and perfect for two. The seasoning/ breaking on chicken was perfection. 

Also had the pulled pork sandwich which was good but shadowed by the perfect friend chicken. 

Dang, such a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try the Stockyards' famous fried chicken and ribs for a long long time! I had a fabulous brunch experience and couldn't wait to come back for dinner! This time, I managed to drag my mom along on my little food adventure. The restaurant itself has very limited seating, so if you live nearby, take-out is highly recommended.

After a grusome 45-min wait staring at some very enticing rack of ribs in the display case, we were finally seated, and right in front of the deep fryer too! I was super excited to see all the action in the open kitchen.

My mom and I totally underestimated how substantial a half rack of ribs ($13) was. It was definitely a sizable portion, and I couldn't imagine trying to demolish a full rack. I had previously read many reviews that described these ribs as extremely tender. To my surprise, they were not fall-off-the-bone tender and had a good bite. My mom actually preferred it this way because it maintained the integrity of the meat (she's not a big fan of mushy meat). But above all, the ribs had an incredible smokiness that was simply scrumptious! The flavours were amazing and minimal sauce was needed. I especially loved the charred ends and the fatty bits. 

And of course we had to order their other specialty- Stockyards fried chicken dinner ($14)- four pieces of buttermilk-marinated chicken served with fries, coleslaw, and hot sauce. I'm not overly picky about fried chicken, so I thought these were delicious, but they weren't mind-blowing. In fact, I preferred the fried chicken in the chicken and waffles brunch version that I had last time.

As expected, the portion was massive, especially that pile of thin cut fries. My mom and I both enjoyed the fries a lot, as they were fabulously crispy. But even after devouring one too many, there was still a mountain of fries left in the basket. In the end, the only item that we managed to finish was the side of coleslaw. 

My mom happily consumed our leftovers over the course of the next two days. I think it speaks a lot that my mom, who never showed much interest in barbeque ribs, actually liked these ones. I will definitely be back to try out their sandwiches and burgers!"}
{"text":"So we just went to Stockyards on St. Clair West. I've heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to try it out.

Our intention was to go for their ribs. But I guess we shoulda read the fine print - that they only serve ribs on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays :-(

Not the end of the world because I also luv good fried chicken. So that's what I ordered. One order comes with four pieces of chicken and a mountain of fries! The fried chicken dinner - not the chicken and waffles. (I've never understood the concept of the chicken and waffles combo but maybe that's just me Lol.) And I ordered a Boylan black cherry pop. Wow, does it ever go good with fried chicken!

The Good
- a friendly, hole-in-the-wall type joint
- personally, I liked the counter seating so I can see all the action in the kitchen
- the chicken is THE best. I normally don't like white meat because it's too dry for my tastes but these folks manage to keep the white meat moist
- the fries are good

The Bad
- we didn't much like the spicy sauce that comes with the chicken
- my friend didn't like the counter-only seating
- the place is small so if u go during prime dinner time like we did, there's quite a line-up. It would be less of a problem if I wasn't that hungry but I was starving so it made the wait seem almost unbearable

Next time I go--and I definitely will go back--I'm not going during prime dinner time! Lol"}
{"text":"Best burgers and fried chicken in town. Come at off peak times, it gets seriously crowded."}
{"text":"Fantastic fried chicken but the star is 'The Stockyard' sandwich on their Sunday brunch menu (runs until about 3pm).  A fried poached egg with bacon or sausage with cheddar on an amazing buttermilk biscuit.  I am salivating thinking about it.  In general; their biscuits are incredible.  The size of your fist; they addictively good.  

The inside is very small but we usually are able to get a spot going in early or very late (for their Sunday brunch). Never been anywhere but at the bar.  It's cozy but comfortable."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had outside of Austin Texas.

Not that this place needs more hype, lots of glowing 4 & 5 star reviews since it opened, but man, it's tasty.

Split a Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8? on its own!) and a half rack of pork ribs ($13) with a friend.  Along with an order of delicious coleslaw (a bit too saucy though), and an order of delicious, perfectly cooked & seasoned fries.

Best part aside from the flavour was walking out not feeling really heavy, greasy or gross.  

Staff are still working out the kinks in the ordering/logistics.  Lots of confusion around which order is take out, has what sides etc., however kinda added to the charm.  Although the staff did seem a bit on edge this is probably something they'll work out as they get more comfortable.

Homemade (?) lime-aid and ice tea were delicious - a nice touch that they let you sample before you choose which to get.

Will definitely be going back, probably have to mark the day on my calendar so there is ample time between BBQ servings (in interest of my cardiovascular health...)

Can't wait until St. Clair isn't a total mess and this place is easier to get to (and park)"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  My son had the burger and fries (xtra fries as well which he was very thankful for), my daughter and I had the Chicken and Waffle.  Excellent taste with the sauce on top of the chicken and waffle.  Customer service was exceptional and as I said, I can't wait to come back.  If you are in Toronto area, you must stop by here to enjoy very good food and some of the best hospitality you will experience."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken! big portion. I have to say the butter burger is greasy but it did bring out the real taste of beef. The fries were also good. However, the 2 times that I was there, both times the fries were a little  different. Once it was good, the other time was a little dry. Overall 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food at The Stockyards was quite good however the location is quite small. The over all experience felt rushed and a little tight to have a good meal and conversation. We found ourselves rushing through the last part of our meal to leave. 

It's unfortunate because we would have stayed there for much longer and maybe ordered something else. While we were leaving we over heard some people giving similar feedback to the front end staff. Over all a good personalized experience where they kept using our names and knew exactly what we had ordered without having to tell them. 

I would return but with the expectation of a quick tasty meal."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is SO good!
Went for Saturday breakfast, knowing of their reputation, and expectations were FAR exceeded.
The operation is simple: two sides of counter seating, streamlined menu, chefs cooking your meal to order right before your very eyes.
Staff were very easygoing and accommodating. No one was phased by our request to have our little guy's car seat on the floor near our seat while he napped.
But the food is what kicks it over the top. Had the chicken and waffles; deliciously crispy coating which came with a spicy syrup and a generous sprinkle of thyme. Also got a breakfast sandwich which came with a slab of house-made bacon, a fried poached egg (it's like the best of both worlds! Genius!) and served on an amazing, huge biscuit. So good.
Very pleased. Thanks for the fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Today is the rainiest most ridiculous day Toronto has seen in a while. Union Station flooded, North and Southbound trains closed, many branches on the ground, it's a real Torontopocolypse out there!

But I've wanted this fried chicken for a while now and nobody could stop me from getting there. I was 40 minutes late for my date, but, as you've probably guessed from my 5 star rating... IT WAS WORTH IT! 

Adorable little place, packed to the brim at 2pm. I had the fried chicken (oh so perfect!), fries, slaw and a cherry soda. My friend had the porcetta sandwich, and I had a few bites of that. It was all greasy goodness. But not make-you-feel-guilty greasy, more like grandma added extra butter greasy. 

Next time I'm going to try a burger, and the time after that I'm going to have the ribs, and then after that the chicken fried steak. I was perfectly happy with my meal, while simultaneously being jealous of those around me.

5 well deserved stars. I'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Well I had been waiting to write this review until I had tried most of the items on the menu and now that I have completed that wonderful feat I am ready to say that I am one of the lucky ones that lives within walking distance of one of the best restaurants this fine city has to offer. I have yet to find an item on this menu that is not worth having over and over again. This restaurant doesn't have much space to sit but it is still very much worth the wait and the trek no matter where you are in the city."}
{"text":"Just had ribs from the Stockyards. 6.5/10. Points deducted for lack of smokiness. I think they were side ribs too. The sauce had a nice vinegary kick. The rub seemed to be kind of tasteless. They were tender though. Perfect level of doneness as the meat didnt fall of the bone but came off with minimal effort."}
{"text":"Good value for money.  I had a burger with fries.  I'm definitely coming back to try other items , especially the fried chicken.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious! fast service, perfect little spot for a bite to eat.
We ordered the fried chicken and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were great! Well priced and big portions. I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Chicken an Waffles!  I've tried one meal here multiple times and it only gets better."}
{"text":"Just wish there was a little more sitting place...."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried chicken in Toronto. Their fries are huge in portion for the fried chicken dinner, so I suggest sharing if you can't finish. The half rib combo is also tremendous. For the price you're paying, this is probably going to be the most filling restaurant you'll run into in Toronto!"}
{"text":"*** a breakfast review only ***

had a friend in from out of town, he highly recommended this place for breakfast in our high energy day that we were to have, he also previously lived in this neighborhood, which made his recommendation more prevalent. he sold his girlfriend on Chicken and wafffffffffffffles, im not a fan of this personally but i knew their had to be other awesome combinations at this establishment. 

a fairly awesome location, from a transit standpoint, directly on the 512 streetcar line makes this location easy to get to, but also easy to get back to the \"central\" subway system. we drove this time around so we had parking right on the street, which was \"metered\" parking.

this place on the viewpoint of the outstand is fairly small with a long and narrow eatery. they had alot of \"oldschool\" touches to the inside of the resturant, ranging from an old pepsi fridge *complete* with a bottle opener, unfortunatly broken, but a nice looking piece of history, as well as an old TTC collector box, for which people dump in coins and bills as tips. 

id be shocked if this place sat 20 people, which is fine, but when the waitress bumps into you when your eating, because the walkway is too narrow, it gets a bit annoying, another compliant of mine was i had requested a glass filled with ice, and i got a \"shaker cup\" barely filled with ice. *my only complaints about this place*

we got the menu, and i was very surprised to see the differing variety of items on the menu, defiantly not a mcds style menu, which is fine, when i go to a sit down restaurant, i don't want normal food, speaking strictly on a food standpoint, it was amazing, and it was quick to come to our table, the flavors were very bold and balanced, i had the smokedtrout, with a side order of bacon and a side order of sausage. my significant other had biscuits with sausage gravy. 
we had the food brought to us in quick fashion, maybe ten minutes or less, i cannot stress enough that the flavor of the food i had was very spectacular. there was four of us eating breakfast and we probably said five words to each other, because we were all engrossed by the sheer flavor and balance of the food. i think we were so focused on the food that we were a bit annoyed with a lady across from us speaking loudly.

i was a tiny bit standoffish about the pricing of the food, but the flavor was absolutely worth every penny. aside from the waitress that was bumping into us, and not listening to my request. the food is defiantly worth it :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. I don't know where these (low-star) reviewers got their meals but I can't imagine it was at this place. We were there on a HOPPING Friday night and still the staff was pleasant, fun, and the food was literally churning out, yet still of the best quality I've had from BBQ in Toronto. The porchetta sandwich is to. die. for and the ribs were amazing; our party also had the brisket sandwich and everything was just stupendous. 

The meats were all highly flavourful, tender and juicy. Seriously. Best animal we've had in ages.

Homemade iced tea was a great touch for someone wanting something tasty to drink and slightly sweet without corn syrup, and we loved the green-ness of the business too. Wish they had more places to sit; we would love to bring big groups of our friends on a regular basis, but alas, the place is really better suited for take-out (locals, or to a local park during good weather) or dine-in for two since there are only about 8 seats in the whole place. We've got our fingers crossed the owners will either expand or, even better, open another location in Toronto with more seating!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite place of all burger joints I've been to.

We had the Pulled Pork Sammy with fries. The fries were so crispy and delicious delicious! so delicious!!! The sandwich was really good too. Awesome how the entire sandwich comes together with so many different tastes. 

It was packed when we went! There was a line... and we had to wait... there were no seats... and it was soooo cold outside. I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"No words to describe this place, food is very fresh and tasty, highly recommend for the best burger in the city !!!"}
{"text":"Totally kick-ass burgers! Wow!
Price is definitely on the high-end but when you see how fresh the patties are you understand why this is a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"Came here Friday evening around 6 for BBQ. Got half chicken half ribs for 2 people. Chicken was really good and tender, but I wasn't a fan of those ribs for they were dry and hard for my taste. It was really busy and the seats near the window were nice."}
{"text":"Small joint but great place. Menu is very small but all of the options hits the right mark. 

Last time we went was on a Saturday for brunch. If you get there early enough, before everyone starts crawling in, you get to get a good seat at the bar watching the masters cook. Waitresses are friendly, fast, and very efficient but they don't work at a pace where it seems like they are rushing for you to leave. 

We ordered a burger and chicken and waffles in total and both were good. Next time, may just do two burgers instead as burgers definitely trumped the chicken and waffles. 

To pay, you go to the cashiers and they take credit card.

For parking, park across the street at the McDonalds parking lot."}
