{"text":"Lovely little Indian restaurant on Ontario.  I saw the good reviews on Yelp, and decided to give it a try even though there was literally no one else in the restaurant the night we went.  So glad that didn't keep us from eating there!  Everything we ordered was delicious -- shag paneer, a chicken dish (can't remember which one), paratha, raita -- and pakoras to start.  The service was very friendly and welcoming.  This place should not be empty!"}
{"text":"Sooo good ! Tellement bon et ce peut importe la saison ! Même mes amies Pakistanaise et indiennes raffolent de cet endroit ! ça vaut le détour !"}
{"text":"I had a little craving awhile ago. I went by the place to check if they have any good soup. I found the soup dal very good and their vegetable samosa very tasty. 

The customer service is good and the food was made immediately after you order, so the freshness is guarantee.

In total, I paid 5,18$ for a soup and a vegetable samosa. I finished the meal satisfied. Will come back for another taste at the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Indian food! But I have to say that I've eaten the worst shahi paneer and the worst chicken tikka masala possible at this restaurant. The shahi paneer wasn't creamy at all, it was like water and have absolutely no taste at all. 
For the chicken tikka masala, the pieces of chicken were good and tender but the sauce was liquid and tasted so artificial that it ruins the chicken. 
To finish on a good note, the naan was just perfect, fluffy and tasty and the waitress was really friendly and the service was impeccable, to bad that the food is a no go!"}
{"text":"Enfin un resto indien dans Centre-sud! Excellent rapport qualité/prix. Les samosas, les bhajis à l'oignon et le thali végé sont très bons. Le service est chaleureux mais quelque peu maladroit. Comme ça vient tout juste d'ouvrir, on peut probablement s'attendre à une amélioration rapide. On y retournera certainement!"}
{"text":"went there today and there was a sign at the door, temporarily closed. also, it's called a different restaurant, yummy Indian, i forgot."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with me lately but all I want is Indian food. This restaurant was in my to try list and I was so happy that it's not too far from my appointment. I had to stop by for takeout before going home. I chose two thalies. One butter chicken and on lamb curry. Both came with curried chickpeas, side salad, basmati rice and a chicken drum or thigh tandoori. It was good and flavourful but lacked the spiciness that I usually crave in Indian food. I'm glad that I asked for extra hot sauce! I'm kinda disappointed that the hot sauce is nothing more then green chilli peppers that had blended into a paste. Thankfully I have about 15 different kinds of hot and very spicy sauce at home lol!!! The service was super nice and welcoming and the food was done within 10 minutes. I would definitely come back here if I had no other options."}
