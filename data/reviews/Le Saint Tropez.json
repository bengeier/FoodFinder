{"text":"We were here for our anniversary dinner. We had made a reservation but they had made no arrangements. We were initially seated outside with the heat vents pointed directly on our heads, we moved tables to go inside and were quite literally sitting with another couple next to us. Both couples were awkward but there was just no room for privacy. The wine was ok, my risotto and the creme brûlée were quite good but the rest of the food was very average (brie croquettes and lamb chops). Service was lacking but the live piano was awesome! Its alright overall but I bet you can find better in Toronto for the same price if not better."}
{"text":"A south france style place. Had the Prefix menu with garden greens salad, sole, and some custard no quite like creme brule. The rice and vegetables were good and buttery! It was really hot in Toronto, and they had the front wide open and no air conditioning. Other than that, it was pretty good! The staff was good, but forgot to bring out half of our desserts, until we asked for them (when the other desserts were all finished)."}
{"text":"Reasonable pricing, but don't expect to much French  kitchen or any surprise. Was OK for a sandwich and quick stop. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here a few years ago when we first started dating. Back then (10 years ago) I remember the food being better then what I had today. 

I ordered the croquettes de Brie. When I had them years ago they were warm, there were 4 pieces and the sauce served with it was a nice accopienment.  This time it was bland only two pieces and was very disappointed.
My partner ordered the escargot, which he said was bland and rubbery.

For the main I ordered their special: seared salmon with dill cream sauce rice and vegetables. Not impressed. I found the salmon salty and their wasn't enough sauce.
My partner ordered the duck which he said was tough and tasteless. The potato what ever that came with it didn't impress him either.

The waitress did ask us how we liked it and we did tell her how we felt.

For dessert I ordered the proiferals with chocolate and ice cream. Not doing that again
My partner had the creme brûlée which he enjoyed.

Overall I left disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very nice ambiance with live music and friendly service. 
But the food that my husband and I ordered was no good. I had a steak which was burned at two sides , basically taste carbon and fries was awful.  

My husband had cod, tasteless basically."}
{"text":"Solid French cuisine... but it's the exceptional courtesy of the service that really stands out. Our desserts were taking too long to come out (which the maitre d' later explained was due to someone cutting their hand whilst the profiteroles were being prepared... seemed legit), so they ended up giving us the dessert and second round of coffees for free! 

We didn't even have to complain! I have literally never encountered that level of classiness before."}
{"text":"Stopped in Le Saint Tropez on a Sunday evening after seeing a movie, by myself, for a quick dinner. I had a Prix Fixe menu. Started with escargot which were very good. Had the pork scallopini which was tough, and the sauce really didn't do much for this. And finished with profiteroles with the ice cream for dessert. The dessert was ok, actually, the portion seemed a little large.

Its a nice place to sit outside, watch the busy street and the passers by (including a man who was trying to parallel park his car and managed to hold up three streetcars in the process) and relax.

If I'm looking for french food, I'll likely look around a few other places before coming back."}
{"text":"Start with Warm crisp Brie, with apple ring and a wild berry chutney. Then Grilled lamb chops with roasted garlic, rosemary jus & seasonal vegetables and finish off with Crème Brûlée. All the while, drinking the most delightful sangria. Congratulations, I just described the perfect meal from my [current] favourite restaurant.

This place is a triple threat: 1. Gorgeous decor and setting (the back patio is  a lovely oasis). 2. Fantastic service (attentive, accommodating and very pleasant - he noticed the table was a bit wobbly and immediately rushed to fix it). And 3. The food (cooked to perfection with a beautiful presentation).

The evening was also filled with live piano music that didn't compete with conversation. Truly, the ultimate date experience... without going to first base, that is.

All items on the menu look fantastic but if I could suggest one thing to all new comers to this place, try the Warm crisp Brie, with apple ring and a wild berry chutney appetizer and the sangria. Your palette will thank you."}
{"text":"The nicoise salad was not quality tuna; it was cheap tuna from a can.  Tourist trap!"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good. Desperately. I've worked nearby forever, and I've never been in. Now I know I shouldn't have bothered. 

When my dining partner and I got in, we were seated promptly enough. Water to start? Sure. Wine? Interesting question - we hadn't ordered our food yet. How could we make an informed wine decision without knowing what we were eating? 

In any case. We ordered the appetizers, entrees, and wine all at once. The appetizers came and went, still no wine. Entrees arrive - no wine! This is now 20 minutes since we had ordered wine. We had to prompt the wait staff to bring us our wine. Not a great start. 

The food was \"alright\". Not the greatest I've ever eaten. I mean, it's chicken and rice on some level. We had gotten through the bread - and had to request a second basket of bread, which was never brought to us. 

Dessert arrives. We both order profiteroles and a cafe au lait. In case folks don't know, profiteroles are supposed to be ice cream balls covered with *piping hot* chocolate sauce. After, again, prompting the waitstaff to bring us our desserts, ours was lukewarm at best. Cold coffee. 

All of that, plus some inattentive waiters, for far too much money. Folks - don't waste your pennies here. Go to Gabby's."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last week and was unimpressed. 
I ordered the omelette and salad combo with an added croissant. We both waited a very long time, and when my food finally did come, the croissant was burnt and almost inedible. I didn't bother sending it back, but  I definitely don't think I'll ever return. Overall, overpriced, bad food."}
{"text":"HAHA !!! With a name like that, it must be a chinese restaurant for sure...eeeuh french sorry! But let's begin with the beginning. I went to that restaurant with a couple a friends coming from all around the world : Brazil, Lebanon, Syria, France. 3 girls, 2 guys. We are not especially fussy about food. So we decided to order the salad, the saucisse de Toulouse, and the Penne pasta. The food was good, but please, do not compare this food to what you will find in France. Nothing to do with the french food you'd find in France, except the names! Of course, it does not taste the same. Moreover, the service was very long, we waited like 1 hour to get our food :( 
10$ for a salad which cost in reality 2$ is really expensive... 
One positive point : the atomosphere and the place is very nice. The guy playing piano makes you feel like you're in France... or not XD!

Cheerios !!!!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience at this restaurant at all. I went to this restaurant with a group of 7 friends on a Friday night. Most of us ordered the seafood linguine and the daily pasta (farfalle with shrimp and beef in rose sauce). First of all, the food is extremely bland. They seem to use the same bland sauce on many pastas, which make them taste pretty much the same. The price was too high for the quality of the food. Second of all, refills on pops are not free, and they do not inform you that beforehand. Only when you get the bill you find out the two little glasses of ice tea cost about 6 bucks. Third of all, the service is just awful. Our waiter was plain rude to us at the end of the meal. He almost just threw the bills on the table. And finally, the overall ambiance is mediocre at its best. Needlessly to say, I will never set my foot at this restaurant again. The only upside to eating at this restaurant is that you don't need to wait to be seated. Well, one can only wonder why..."}
{"text":"2/5. The ahi tuna sandwich is horrible! Extremely overlooked. Do not recommend any of the restos in theatre district."}
{"text":"I expected great things after seeing an average of 4 stars for this joint. There is definitely a Parisian/French feel to this restaurant with the textured pastel-coloured walls and the art work, don't know if the live piano player adds to it or makes it less Parisian, but it was a nice touch nonetheless. 

Having a group has it's advantages as I got to sample a number of dishes. The French onion soup I ordered was absolutely delicious, full of flavour with ample amounts of cheese, onions and bread crumbs. My main dish while it sounded good \"Aiguillette de canard a l'orange et au Grand Marnier\" (duck breast with orange Grand Marnier sauce), did not taste good at all, extremely disappointed. The duck meat was chewy and the orange Grand Marnier sauce was bland and had a hint of bitterness - like eating the zest of an orange. I think a splash of orange juice would've sweeten up the flavour and would've made the sauce more enjoyable. The gratin potatoes and vegetables that came with the dish was really good and done well. I also sampled the risotto with seafood, that came out very soupy, which made the risotto very mushy, as my friend described it, \"it reminds me of congee\". Another dish was a pork tenderloin with a red wine and blueberry sauce, it was ok, meat was tender but the sauce was missing something. There was one main that was really good - one of the daily specials, a swordfish done in a orange dill sauce. Overall I still had a good time at the restaurant, it had more to do with the company I was with, than with the food. The wait staff is attentive and the ambiance made you feel really comfortable. On the fence about coming back here again, maybe just for the french onion soup I would. There are better alternatives: Coquine Restaurant (on Yonge), Cafe la Gaffe (on Baldwin) and Jules (on Spadina)."}
{"text":"So it's the summer and I had planned to meet a couple of friends for lunch in the downtown area. My friend chose the place, knowing that we wanted to explore the many restaurants along that street. Safe enough to say that although there wasn't anything terribly horrible, it was just O.K.

The place was virtually empty, although granted that it was 12pm on a weekend afternoon. It filled up as it went later into the afternoon. The staff were pleasant enough.

Because we could only take about an hour for lunch (the joys of work), I went with the lamb chops with red wine glaze and chose the frites ($19). My friends chose the liver and the ratatouille. When they came, I was midly surprised by the salad which accompanied my lamb. I asked the waiter and he said, \"Oh alright, I'll grab you some.\" Well then, that's fixed. The lamb chops themselves were pretty burnt; I guess it would've tasted nice (it was nicely cooked on the inside, medium-rare) but all I could taste was the charcoal. At least I doused it in the glaze to smother the burnt taste. My friends enjoyed theri dishes, so maybe it was just mine. The fries came a while later, and to be honest they tasted like fast food fries, similar to Mcdonalds. So I wasn't very impressed, but hey. Apparently that's what the french do. 

All in all, it was just 'meh'. I would've expected something much better for the price and the 'high-quality' it promotes itself to be, but it didn't stop the afternoon crowd from filling up the place. Probably wouldn't come back if I had a choice."}
{"text":"My partner, best friend and I decided to go to Le Saint Tropez for dinner before going to see a show on a Thursday evening.  I wasn't expecting anything exceptional, but decent French food.  Unfortunately that didn't quite pan out.

My friend got there first and was standing in the doorway for 5 minutes before anyone came up.  I made a reservation, but apparently they don't keep records!  When he got seated, he wasn't offered any menus, not even a drink menu.  We got to the restaurant a few minutes after that and after sitting down, waited for another 10 minutes to get a waitress to notice us.  Now, I am not a fussy customer and I will typically let that go - it was busy at the time - however, when other people who came in after we did had menus and drinks before us, that ticked me off.

As for the food, the mussels appetizer was very good.  The main courses were another thing:  I had the veal, my partner had the duck and my friend had the lamb shank (special).  The veal was tough, the duck was dry, and the lamb was 'sub-par at best'.

Now for the kicker:  It was obvious that the Maitre d' was in a hurry to get us out so he could have a good turnaround, however, we had the same intention as we had the show to catch, but my wine glass was literally snatched from my hands by him!  Granted, I had less than a sip of wine in there but that took me aback.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  Mr. Maitre d' (or manager?), I would suggest that you lighten up, smile a little, and perhaps learn a little customer service.

I don't have any intentions in coming back to Le Saint Tropez, nor will I suggest to any of my friends, or enemies!, to spend their hard earned money at this establishment."}
{"text":"While we were in Toronto, we had drinks and aperture at this place.  We had Very good server, good jazz music, piano player, good wine, good location."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day - so happened to be during the WC and the France game was on. A bit noisier and more crowded as usual, but it was interesting to watch a France match in a French restaurant. Quite authentic feeling and decor which moves it from 3stars to 4. 
The service was relatively OK for a jammed lunch during the match so was quite impressed. The menu is interesting but rather thin and had a bit of trouble choosing something. The chicken sandwich with goat cheese and spinach was actually OK. But just that. OK. Kinda of a 3 star type of rating. But ultimately the decor and decent service made me put that extra star in there..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and interior decoration was gorgeous.  Also, there was a pianist present.

However, our waitress was very rude and inattentive.  Other wait staff was kind enough to assist us.  The manager also came by from time to time when we looked helpless."}
{"text":"I ate here in the summer because the man standing outside had enticed us to stop by as we were walking past.  We sat on the patio and the only thing I remember about my mediocre and  unmemorable meal was that it was overpriced.  The service was decent if not a little slow.  Not the worst dining experience ever but I feel it explains why they have someone standing outside to lure customers in."}
{"text":"Comme ci comme ca (see what I did there?). Wasn't particularly wowed by anything, but nothing was really all that bad. The most notable thing was the cold coffee I was served the first time. So take that as you will. I'd go back, but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"Came across this cute restaurant after some sightseeing in the city.  What a cute place, with what looks like french flair (not that I've ever been to France).

I ordered the Riviera Sandwich which was absolutely delicious!  I'm not partial to mushrooms at all, once I finished the sandwich my husband mentioned there was a portobello cap in the sandwich...I didn't even realize, it was all so yummy!! Grilled veggies and goat cheese on a ciabatta bun, fantastic! 

The creme brûlée dessert was the perfect end to our meal.  Great little place!"}
{"text":"Mep yes should have read the reviews. adequate but overall dissapointed as I've experienced so much better for the price. food came in under 5 minutes and while not cold yet not quite hot was left with the attention not much care was put into the meal. One yes one half mushroom on one of the veal tenderloins and a few scraps of artichoke hearts on the other. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place late evening with a couple friends. Found the food to be surprisingly good for the price, and quite authentic. Service was friendly and just the right pace. Really cool live music at a perfect volume to allow for casual conversation. We were inside, but the patio looked nice - great location. Would definitely recommend or go back."}
{"text":"I am basing this review solely on the dealings that I had with the manager and staff of this restaurant. 

I called a couple of weeks in advance and set up a television shoot here. The person I spoke with on the phone said he was the manager and was more than happy to accommodate our request. 

A couple of days before the shoot I called to confirm and everything was still a go. It was a little annoying calling into the restaurant (everyone seemed so flustered and I ended up waiting on hold for quite awhile until they got me in touch again with the same man I had previously spoken with), however since everything was going to work out at the logistics end of our shoot, I didn't mind spending so much time setting this all up. 

The day of the shoot, literally 5 minutes before we were all getting into the crew vehicle to head over to the restaurant, I called to let them know we were on our way. I asked to speak with the man I had been corresponding with for the past two weeks and was VERY rudely told on the phone that he was NOT the manager. I assured the person that I was speaking to that he had told me he was and the actual manager continued to ream me out on the phone. I asked him how I was supposed to know that someone who claimed to be the manager of the restaurant was not in fact the manager, but the actual manager continued to tear a strip off of me and told me that he refused to let our crew come and shoot at their restaurant. 

Um... EXCUSE ME?!?!?!? Two weeks notice and 2 confirmation calls and 5 minutes before we're scheduled to arrive you're going to pull the rug out from underneath me? REALLY?!?!?!? 

Well yes. Thank god a neighbouring restaurant agreed to have us last minute. 

As for Le Saint Tropez - they are going down in my VERY bad books for eternity. The fake manager, the actual manager, and all the other poser managers can take a stick and SHOVE. IT."}
{"text":"Excellent little place with amazing food and great people. The service was wonderful. A little bit pricey, but with the quality of the food and the serving size you are given, it is well worth the pay.

The food at this restaurant was great but it was the fabulous singer/piano player as well as the exceptionally entertaining staff that will bring us back to this establishment again. An outstanding evening!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now (once with family, and once with a friend I hadn't seen in 18 years.) In both cases the food was wonderful (if you've ever been to Provence, you will recognize much of the fare on offer; pastas, grilled meats, fish - not all the sauces that people often associate with French cuisine.) 

Last night it was a delicious cold peach soup and succulent grilled lamb. My friend had a salad and a perfectly grilled salmon.  The manager helped us choose a perfect red wine, and the meal-ending cappuccino was flavourful with no bitterness. The ambiance is \"classy-rustic\", with a fantastic terrace at the back.

As much as I like all this, I am also a real fan of the service. The manager was quite happy to answer all our wine questions, and the servers have always been more than cheerful and accommodating.  Last night's \"reunion dinner\" meant we sat for a long time after we finished eating. Our server was gracious about checking in from time to time, but in no way making us feel like we needed to get out of there. Another server was happy to take the obligatory photo for us.

So I am nothing but a fan. Our dinner for 2 with appetizers, wine and cappuccinos came to about $120. Not bad at all for such excellently prepared food and accommodating service. The only draw-back is that it makes me long for a few weeks in  the south of France. At least this is a great substitute."}
{"text":"Loved this place.   Great ambience.   Had a nice dinner accompanied by piano.  The sweet potato soup was amazing."}
{"text":"No good!  The food here is really bad!  Whyyyyyyyyy.

I had dinner here with a friend visiting Toronto, and we ordered the brie croquette, the shrimp in Pernod sauce, and the orange duck, and we both agreed that it tasted like Stanford dining.  Which isn't bad, but Stanford dining is all you can eat for $10 bucks each, and I was a little saddened by the fact that we were paying so much for food so mediocre.

The deep fried brie was not a great idea because the flavors don't match (wild berries + brie that really tastes like a jalapeno popper?). The duck was done medium rare as the chef suggested but way worse than what you'd get at a Chinese deli, and both dishes were served with standard blanched zucchini and broccoli.  The shrimp was done in your usual red sauce.  Very whatever.  There are better, cheaper eats out there, Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here on a blustery Christmas Day as it was the only place that was open for dinner that wasn't $100/head.

We were very relieved to get a spot a 5:30pm, as the place was already packed. We were seated right away and enjoyed some nice music from a piano player. It was a really nice atmosphere and the service was great.

The food, on the other hand was pretty subpar. I started with the escargots, which were rubbery and bland. Plus, they were served in a tomato sauce with bacon rather than garlic butter. I knew this going in, but I thought that anything with bacon had to be good. I don't actually think there was any bacon in the dish.

For the mains, we had the duck breast with potato gratin and the sausage and frites. They were nice enough to sub the potatoes gratin with rice, since I can't have dairy. I ordered the duck breast medium, but it came beyond well done. Once again, there was a lack of flavour. It was a tough piece of meat on a puddle of salty sauce. The sausage was overly salty and pretty ordinary. The frites were great, but you don't go to a restaurant purely for the frites.

So atmosphere and service were great, but I don't think we'll be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"I ate here solo while on business.  I ordered the steak and frittes along with a few glasses of wine.  The service was fair and the food was not good.  There was a guy out front offering coupons for a free appetizer or dessert...that should have been a clue.  The food was tasteless, the steak was fatty and tough.  Try other places and don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Looooong wait, but the waiter was very personable. It was incredibly busy. The escargot was very tasty. Seafood linguini was good, but not spectacular (granted, why would I choose Italian at a French place?), but the waiter recommended it over the other option I was thinking about (the chicken with goat cheese and spinach... so...). Really, it was a pleasant night sitting on the back patio with good ambiance, but the service was slow and as the definitions for the ratings go, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Great location après film viewing.  We really enjoyed the live piano music and friendly staff.  The steak was so French and flavorful. The 2009 Haut Medoc was well priced for that great vintage year.  Overall very nice time and authentic French restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Incredibly average meal for the price. I had the duck which was cold a rubbery, my friend had the lobster, steak thingy which they didn't have any lobster so they gave him shrimp and charged him the same price. For dessert I had a chocolate mouse and he had a creme brûlée which once again was nothing special. It was all very plain and with a bottle of wine and tips came to $132 for the two of us. I could think of a lot better places I could go to for that price."}
{"text":"Ehhh, I've had MUCH better. I almost felt like I was eating a frozen dinner meal. The lamb I ordered was ok, and the veggies on the side- NOT so french. It was steamed cauliflower and carrots with salt and butter. I don't believe I have ever seen that in a french restaurant before (especially in France). This place almost seems more like a tourist trap and we fell for it even though we're not tourist. LOL

Not a fan. Don't plan on going back. I make better food at home."}
{"text":"Came here randomly for brunch on a Sunday.

Service was ridiculously slow, so slow that we were getting mad the food hadn't arrived, and even after we got served there were people around us who had been there a lot longer who didn't get served yet! They should have been served first.

The food was meh. My wife's eggs benedict was ok. My mussels were disgusting. Old, beards still on, in a sauce described as \"White wine cream\" but just tasted like a bowl of milk.

Think about that.

Bearded Mussels in warm milk.

Fuuuuck that. UGH."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and decent prices. The service and cozy ambiance were perfect for a romantic anniversary dinner, right down to the mellow piano music. I had the chicken breast stuffed with spinach and goat cheese, my husband had the lamb - both dishes were cooked well and full of flavor. Right across the street from the Hyatt where we stayed, great find and surprisingly not all that expensive!"}
{"text":"One of the most over-priced and underwhelming restaurants on the tourist-trap area of King west. We got wrangled in with the lure of live music (a pianist who was actually not bad) but ended his act 10 minutes after we sat down.

The food is pretty pricey and VERY mediocre. There's nothing exorbitantly 'French' about it and the flavours are very bland. At half the price I wouldn't have anything to complain about but when they're charging $22-35 / main I'm expecting something special!

Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I find the atmosphere to be tacky and outdated and completely tasteless for an upscale restaurant. The waiters were rather unprofessional on this quiet night, stolling around and whistling as if they were bored out of their minds.

I could go on and on, but regardless this is one place you SHOULD not drop by into after watching a show on King St.!"}
{"text":"We found Le Saint Tropez by accident on the way to the CN tower.   We ate there due to the \"special\" -order an entree and receive a starter.  My youngest child likes escargot and does not get it often.  He enjoyed it.   The salmon was a small portion but not bad.   The quiche was also very small for the price but good.  It was a hot afternoon and we had to ask twice to have the awning put down.  The special was only good if we sat outside.  The pate was ok, but served with only 2 crostini and we needed a couple extra pieces.  Overall an ok experience, but if you are on a budget, try a different place as we were soon hungry."}
{"text":"This place was just fantastic. Food was so good. I got the Beef Tenderloin and my boyfriend got the Duck. Both were super tasty and authentic. My favorite part about this place was the piano player. He played so well and was constantly smiling. You could tell that he was really enjoying himself."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My friend Michele and I meet for dinner about once a month and no longer go anywhere else. They never let us down here. The servers are all charming, and efficient. I usually have a fish dish or their liver [which I love, but rarely find in other places]....they cook both of these to perfection. Their house wines are well chosen and suit both our tastes. I have been going here for many years now, and to Marcel's , upstairs. Not surprised they are still around. they never let me down.  Both restaurants are a real treat for me. I favour St Tropez, having grown up in the South of France though. It takes me back.... I have introduced many people to their delights, over the years..They have all been pleasantly surprised.."}
{"text":"More accurately 4.5 stars. I had an excellent experience at Le Saint Tropez last fall. 
First thing to note is that the restaurant is one of the two joint venues (upstairs is Marcel's Bistro) overlooked by the very professional and tasteful chef Siebert! The small space is beautifully decorated, and the live French piano and song are sure to take the mood and experience to the next level. 
As for the food, the lamb and veal are highly recommended as is the liver in white wine and garlic butter (surprisingly!)
The wine list is fairly extensive and the waiters are helpful with suggestions.

Our waitress could have been more attentive, but at least for me, everything else made up for it. Probably the best choice on the King W strip of flashy restaurants."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, just the worst.

Appetizer - the Croquette de Brie looked like fried mozzarella sticks and was served with the smallest piece of crostini ever. It was big enough for two bites. Are you supposed to eat Brie plain? Was the crostini just for decor? 

Entree - I ordered the sole that was stuffed with shrimp. I wanted to throw up after my first bite. It had a strange gelatinous texture to it. The only thing that should have that texture is JELLO! Coworker ordered some pasta special which he summed it up in one word, \"Sucked\". I even took a bite and I'd have to agree. Flavorless, flavorless, flavorless. I offered him my sole and he quickly denied. heh.

Staff - the waitress was not very attentive and was very defensive when she brought out the wrong dish to my coworker. She did not seem very knowledgeable when I asked her questions about certain items on the menu. She just stated that everything was good (obviously not based on what I stated earlier about my entree!)

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Le Saint Tropez is a cute French restaurant within the Entertainment District, but I struggled to compare the food to that of France. I came with a group of coworkers, and we each ordered appetizers and main courses to get a good sampling of the menu and use our company's meal compensation. 

First, I had the mussels, which was the most generous portion of mussels I've ever gotten in a restaurant. The bowl was piled high with juicy mussels in a white wine sauce. This was definitely the highlight of my meal, with simple seasoning used to elevate the natural flavor of the mussels. For my main course I had the fish special of the day, but it wasn't particularly memorable at all. Although the fish and a nice sear on it, the sauce was too heavy. The sweet potato garnish just made the entire dish more heavy as well. Overall, I think it's hit or miss here, so be careful what you order!"}
{"text":"I would give Le Saint Tropez 2-1/2 stars.

I really wanted to like this place, as the service was very courteous and friendly, and the restaurant was very charming.

I love French food, however I was extremely disappointed with the food. I ordered the venison (medium-rare), which most of the pieces were overcooked and chewy. The veg on the side was overcooked, bland and lost its color. The other side of scalloped sweet potatoes was nice, but strangely looked like a whole boiled sweet potato (the slices of potato molded were back into its original form, how funny).
My friend ordered the salmon, which was also dry and overcooked, and the side of basmati rice was undercooked.
I didn't find the food very French-like, and the presentation was rather bland and boring (like banquet food).

The tulip nouget dessert was very nice. The ice cream had a lot of vanilla and you could tell it is homemade. It was served in a phylo-dough tulip and a light mango coulis.

The prices reflects the King Street/theatre district locale, unfortunately the mediocre food didn't doesn't quite live up."}
{"text":"We've had a great time every time we've been to Le Saint Tropez. The place is usually crowded, but they are still able to maintain an intimate atmosphere.  I've had the steak frites which can in an absolutely delicious sauce. The beef tenderloin melts in your mouth. I also enjoyed the grilled marlin which was both tender and delicious. The entertainment with dinner is often very good and adds to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you want a front row seat in my heart, just offer me a bowl of soup with rice. I WILL NOT TURN YOU DOWN. I adore any kind of rice-y soup and before I became vegetarian, the chicken/tomato bisque with rice soup at Sandwich Box and I were regular lovers. 

When I saw vegetable soup with rice on the menu at Le Saint Tropez I just had to order it. It was served in a fancy, french onion soup-ish porcelain chalice and it alone could have tided me over till the next meal, but I had to click things up a few notches by ordering the marinated grilled vegetables with goat cheese - also quite good, though I wasn't a fan of 50% of the vegetables (green peppers, red onions and eggplant). 

NOTE TO STAFF: The use of Comic Sans on the awning is not appreciated - by anyone. Also, the restaurant's tagline is \"the best of France under one roof\", which seems ballsy until you notice the French typos on the menu. Not exactly a beacon of authenticity."}
{"text":"I went here with M after strolling around after dinner.  We wanted some dessert just before we go watch a movie at TIFF.  I thought, well it's French and French people normally make good desserts.  So we went in and I saw the words \"mille feuille\" on the specials and proceeded to order it.

I was so hoping that this would be better than the one at Cafe de las Alas in NYC because I personally don't like going to NYC except for that one dish at that one restaurant.  Unfortunately, NYC still holds the throne on that dish.

The one we had was excessively buttered, granted I like buttery stuff, I don't like the feel of eating a stick of butter.

The layers were not blended correctly, and it was small for $7.  So for dessert, I don't think I would come here again.

I ended my meal with an espresso just to keep me up for TIFF after a long day of work, I needed it.  It was good, but it's just espresso.  Same as I would get at the Maple Leaf Lounge at Toronto Pearson Airport (only I had to pay for it).

Service was still exemplary, but you can't eat the waiter service (I don't swing that way either ^_^ )

Probably won't go here again, unless invited."}
