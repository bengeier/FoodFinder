{"text":"What really impressed me about this place was the owner. He was so nice and you could tell he has a real passion for what he does. He took the time to explain to us the different sauces and whats truly authentic and offered us some sweets while we waited for our food to be done.

The food was great and the bubble tea was amazing. It actually had flavor! I grabbed a few of their menus and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Authentic yummy pho. My boyfriend & I grabbed pho to go on a rainy September weeknight when I was suffering from a really bad sore throat of an oncoming cold. This was the perfect cure! Delicious and soothing, this is going to be my go-to sick soup supplier. Staff was friendly, though when we arrived they were taking up 3/4's of the tables to eat their own dinner. Most customers came in and picked up their food to go, so this probably isn't the right spot for sit-down dining if that's what you're looking for. Nevertheless, a great little spot and somewhere I will definitely be back to!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite takeout pho place. The sate beef noodles soup is very yummy, I usually order this.. unless it's a bit of a warmer day I will opt for the sate beef with spring rolls and rice vermicelli (dry noodles you get a little bowl of fish sauce to add to the mix). The prices are very reasonable, only charging $8.95 a bowl, I don't know many pho restaurants that can beat this. The service is quick, I typically call 10 min ahead for my takeout. The staff are friendly and they are good with packing your food in a easy, no mess manner. The only issue is parking can sometimes be difficult on 17 Ave.."}
{"text":"Its one of my favorite Pho place.  They are very customer friendly. Spicy sate chicken pho is my favorite."}
{"text":"During opera season this is my go-to place for a quick bite after work and before evening rehearsals as it's just around the corner from the Mamdani Opera Centre. The food is fresh and cheap. My favourite is the sate beef sub but I've also tried the Ph and the BÃºn, both decent size servings and all under $10 after tax! The service has always been excellent and most recently the nephew of the original owners have taken over the running of the place. The people are just nice people. One day a woman and a child came in speaking Chinese and none of us understood what they were after but with much patience the owner figured out  that they wanted water for the child. Some people might have just pointed to the cooler where there were bottles of water for sale but they very obligingly gave the child and adult a free bottle of water and made the pair feel welcome. Saigon Baguette is tucked away just off 17 Ave with several other small take-out places offering a variety of foods. There are some small tables great for people like me who need to eat and run but it is really meant to be a take-out place. The parking lot is run by Impark but they have a pass they can give you to display on your car if you're staying in to eat so that you don't have to pay, just don't forget to return it to them before you drive off."}
{"text":"I don't usually write a review after trying a place only once but these guys totally deserve it!

Great, healthy, hearty food and fantastic service ... can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Small shop, was a little taken aback when I saw the patio decor, and not very busy for a Friday at dinner time, but the spring rolls, Pho and Vietnamese style iced coffee (with coffee imported from Vietnam) were all delicious - probably the best of all 3 I've had in Calgary. This place deserves a go, although very limited seating makes it more appropriate as a to go or delivery location. Also of note, very friendly. Had many a great pho experience with abrupt or unpleasant service, this was just excellent start to finish."}
{"text":"Founded by the original owners of Saigon Y2K as retirement was driving them batty out of boredom, this little sub shop that could has gotten even better than ever.  They've added some tables inside the take out shop so you can eat and relax to the tv (I noticed they seem to like Bite Comedy Channel a lot) and expanded their offerings on the menu.  More importantly, while it had been operated primarily by the daughter of the Y2K owners originally, the owners have completely come out of retirement to ensure that the recipes are given proper justice and are serving hoardes of hungry teens all day from the local Western Canada High School and the nearby residents of the surrounding area. 

I still try to drop by here at least once a week, as the Sate Chicken Noodle soup is simply awesome, and it's a great warm embrace on a cold night.  The Spring rolls are always stuffed with excellent pork, veggies and vermichelli, and especially crispy with that kind of perfect yumminess that only well done home style vietnamese can deliver.  The Pho soup base hits the right note of salt and echoes of lime and thai basil, and just lifts whatever meat or seafood to a new level.  And more importantly, with any and all of their Sate dishes, there's just a right level of spiciness that gives a slight kick with every bite.  Just awesome. 

By the way, they now even offers delivery for all purchases over $30.  Definately worth noting if you don't feel like braving the cold.
