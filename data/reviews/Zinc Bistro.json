{"text":"Chocolate soufflé with Grand Marnier sauce was amazing. They split into 2 dishes for us to share. Cappuccinos were very good. French onion soup was way too salty. People at the next table didn't like theirs either. Spinach salad was wonderful too."}
{"text":"Very happy with our dinner. Food was delicious and the service was superb. Loved the atmosphere. It was a memorable meal. Thank you."}
{"text":"Dined here for dinner. November, 2017.  Food was good, service was sub par.  Fresh oysters to start - pleased to have a couple of Kumamoto oysters. Really good with the mignonette. Main - Salmon was cooked perfectly; I didn't get to taste the gazpacho, but the socca cake was soft and flavorful. Main - Scallops were cooked nicely as well. Corn and chorizo risotto was very savory and a really good balance of flavors (sweetness of corn and saltiness of chorizo) as well as texture (risotto vs chorizo). Plating was nice. Dessert - Chocolate souffle. This is a must (and should be ordered ahead of time as it takes 20-30 mins to make). Opted for plain chocolate and it was perfect. Not sweet at all, which made us appreciate it more so.  As for the service...let me enumerate: 1. After letting our server know that we needed a few minutes to go over the menu (and drink choices), we were given more than a few. Without waters. Tables were seated and cleared around us before the server came back with the comment, \"Oh they haven't brought you water.\" As if to shift the blame to others. Asked us if we'd prefer they get us waters before getting our orders. That should not have been a question at all. I said yes, water was delivered, orders were taken, which brings me to... 2. No draft beer. This should have been communicated beforehand. 3. This is minor and doesn't really matter as much: no white wine glasses. My sancerre was served in a red wine glass. Again, no big deal. I just found that curious. 4. Our oysters came without that small bottle of tabasco and without a spoon for the mignonette. The server came and commented that it should have arrived with the tabasco and motioned to grab it. Before they left, I mentioned the mignonette spoon as well. The server came back with the spoon. No tabasco. And asked if we wanted it. At that point, we were already staring at the oysters for a bit. So eff it, I said \"No,\" and went without. 5. Our side dish never came. We ordered the peewee potatoes. As we tucked into our salmon and scallops, we noticed that the potatoes never came. After waiting for our water, finding out they didn't have draft beer, and no tabasco, we thought, for the second time: Eff it. And kept going. The main dishes were solid and filling that we opted to just let it go. This would have been a bigger issue if it was on the bill (it wasn't).  Thankfully, no issues with the dessert.  So there you go. I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time, unfortunately, the experience did not really live up to my expectation. Food was the saving grace."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Zinc Bistro when I came here for lunch.  First of all, the decor is wonderful.  The interior really does remind me of bistros I frequented in Paris.  That put me in a good mood right off the bat.  We chose to eat on the terrace because it was a nice, sunny day.    I ordered the chicken and brie sandwich, which was absolutely delicious.  The flavors were wonderful and it was quite a substantial meal.  My friend ordered the macaroni and cheese, which she described as amazing and decadent.  We split an order of the house fries, which were good but not out of this world.  I also had a bellini, which was nice, but not $12 nice.  Service was polite and efficient.  Menu featured some really delicious options, most with French influence.  I would definitely come here again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had great meal last night with the fam. The Foie Gras was made perfectly. Salads and Entrees were terrific also. The Grand Marnier and chocolate souffles were delicious. The coffee service was French Press, nice touch. The service was absolutely spot on. After all these years, this place still delivers a great meal,  in a great atmosphere with great service."}
{"text":"Im a fan.  Their sliders are really good and the atmosphere is cool also.  If you go there during the day you can see the Real Housewives of North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the valley for sure.  Food is amazing.  We had foie gras and squab appetizer, scallops, filet and fioe gras rossotto.  Everything was very good.  Very romantic atmosphere too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Bar is cool!  Great chocolate soufflé! Wonderful ambiance.  The soufflé is huge so nice to share with someone. The sauce You can add orange grand marnier .  The sparkling Eiffel Tower so beautiful and elegant.   Wine and Chocolate, doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Nice decoration and style choices, nothing else to recommend it.   Went here for lunch on our wedding anniversary. Looked like it would be a nice dining experience from photos. The restaurant was more than half empty, but we were placed at a table right next to another couple, close enough that if we all stuck out our elbows, we would be touching. Other people who were seated after us were scattered around, so I don't know why the hostess crammed us together but didn't do so with others; the servers worked various areas of the restaurant so I don't think it was to fill up a specific person's tables or something like that.   Food: okay. The organic greens on the menu was a handful of a salad pack you can buy at the store. We asked for the dressing on the side so it was obviously a literal handful of the salad pack. I think it was $8. Rest of the food was good but not something I'd go out of the way for. Other prices were reasonable.   Service: slow, forgetful, and unapologetic. Took a while to take our orders, couldn't answer questions about how the seafood was cooked and was unwilling to ask the kitchen. We asked to split one of the entrees (soup) and was told that was fine (and we were ordering 2 other entrees as well). It didn't come split, and when we asked for it to be split, she brought an extremely shallow bowl and suggested we pour it as carefully as we could. She would not take it back to the kitchen or bring a larger spoon to help it out. 4 of the servers, including ours, spent a lot of time standing in the back of the restaurant talking, with their backs to the rest of the floor. When we were trying to get her attention, none of them looked over or made any effort to look around the floor. Someone from the bar area noticed us first and walked over to the group to let them know people were waiting for service. We had ordered drinks at the very beginning, she forgot about them completely until AFTER the bill came; they didn't charge us for the drinks and did bring them out shortly after the bill, so we got a few sips of them, but we weren't going to stay around just to drink them.   Management: When we handed in our bill and payment, we asked to talk to the manager. No one came. So when we were walking out we asked the hostess to talk to the manager. She was the manager. When we told her the issues, she said \"well there's nothing I can do about it now.\" No apology, no horror or surprise, no offer to make it better. We said it was a disappointing experience, especially for a special occasion. She said that it was our fault for not mentioning it was our anniversary, they would have given us a dessert. We didn't want dessert, just an acceptable lunch! And, it didn't occur to her to offer this dessert to go. One last attempt to get any reaction from her was met with a shrug and slight roll of eyes.   This was in September 2016, hopefully they have found more experienced and professional management by now."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Food is very nicely preepared.  I have had a few of their chicken dishes, short ribs, lamb, and their omlette a couple of times.   Service is always stellar and on the warm side of professional. One of my favorites for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Really an amazing place with great food, and a great bartender, Sean.  The one downside is the owner, Thierry, who treats the restaurant as his personal fiefdom, ignoring the fact that his patrons pay for his existence.  If you want to do business at the bar, and you have patrons paying for your liquor, and that their exuberance disturbs you, take your business to your office.  I find it shocking that a person who owes his existence to paying patrons treats them badly - perhaps a small course in cultural sensitivity wouldn't hurt.  This is America, and not France - keep your attitude for the French.  The customer comes first, but of course, we can't expect everyone to understand that.  I've nothing but praise for Zinc Bistro's bar staff and cooks, and the great food they serve, but nothing but contempt for the owner that they report to."}
{"text":"So dissapointed!  I m french and i enjoyed to eat on the zinc bistro to eat french cuisine. We ordered two oyester plate fot apetizer. We were horrified because they smelled so bad! My wife eat one and was sick all the day! The manager came , take back the plate and told us he don't count the plates on the bill, thank you so much! Id certainly prefered apologizes. After that i took a ribeye with peper sauce. The waitress gave me my plate and immediatly took it away because the size was to big for lunch! This size is usually for dinner.! I never see that in any restaurant in my life. We went out very irritate and disspointed with our bad experience. I will never return in that place"}
{"text":"So.. the background story...two months ago I made reservations at Zinc Bistro to celebrate my boyfriends birthday.  To make sure I had the perfect evening planned I called the restaurant and spoke to the awesome event coordinator to plan a very special dinner menu.  In taking her advice on the best dinner items, we set the birthday menu.  When we arrived to the restaurant we were seated at a nice table in the beautiful courtyard and once we ordered our drinks the five course meal began.  Wonderfully prepared, the meal was amazing and a perfect mix of flavors! The onion gratinee tastes as good as it looked on the food network.  Warm, cheesy, and full of flavor. The duck confit with roasted corn and foie gras appetizer was amazing.  For dinner we had the diver scallops and flat iron steak, fabulous!!! Definitely the meals of choice.  Finally my boyfriend was presented with a chocolate ganache soufflé steaming hot and fresh from the oven.  I definitely earned the GF of the year award for this experience.  Thanks to the staff at Zinc Bistro for helping me create an evening BF will never forget.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went to Kierland Mall in hopes to dine at Ocean Club, only to find a 1 hour 50 minute wait, next stop North, who had a 45 minute wait. By chance I walked over to Zinc where I was seated immediately! I should have know there was a reason and I found out very soon.  Although the place was half empty, the manager insisted our party of 2 sit at a tiny table that was soon over- crowded with just a bread basket and a bottle of wine. Where were they going to put the food? Well after they spilled a glass of wine on the both of us while trying to set down our appetizer, I got up and moved us to one of the larger empty tables. The bus staff (who was excellent) help us gracefully make the move. The manager (Ben)  however, still tried to hassle us even though the place was now even emptier than when we first arrived. In spite of all this, our barely-existent waiter took our order after I had to send for him twice. He was not helpful at all in explaining any dishes, and could not make any recommendations when asked for suggestions. He was very bothered by the whole process and seemed more interested in talking to his manager between ever course. I continually had to keep asking for him to keep the dinier moving. When the check came, I caught two mistakes, he over-charged us for a bottle of wine I didn't order and added an appetizer that was supposed to be for someone elses bill. The prices are high enough, there is no need to pad the bill, but double-check it for sure.   The food was outstanding! The best short ribs I've ever eaten and I order it everywhere I can. Too bad the dining experience ruined the night. Obviously, the word must be out. High prices, very dim lights (always makes me suspicious about what they are trying to hide) and horrible service explains why there is always a table available. Do yourself a favor, wait the hour elsewhere, it will be better than ruining your night."}
{"text":"Have dined here a number of times over the years.    There is patio seating for people watching, dining room seating and a fabulous secret garden type French courtyard, too.  My favorite is the huge cheese/olive/nut board with a choice of 10 different exotic cheeses from various countries to choose from.  The cheese is served with warm olives, spiced walnuts and crisp bread. This usually ends up as my meal -- along with a glass of fine wine.  This is a wonderful place to just sit, relax and enjoy the afternoon with a friend on the patio -- or for a simply romantic date night in the courtyard."}
{"text":"I took my daughter for a late lunch (she was visiting from LA), because we have good memories eating here when she was younger.  We were seated outside, maybe three feet from the entrance door- and some tables are too close together. I don't want to hear in public about a stranger's (or anyone's) recent surgery, especially while eating (and I am a nurse). The server immediately seemed rushed and inattentive. My daughter ordered the crab crepe, which was excellent- it should be for $21. I ordered the burger, based on the \"gourmet\" menu description- it was nothing special- maybe a dollop of Dijon would improve it, but no condiments were offered. A local Delux burger is much better, for half the price.  The server asked once, long after we were served (by a kitchen runner- not him) how the meal was- in that affected, fake manner of not really caring what the response was, because he was rapidly turning and walking away as he asked. I said it was \"ok\" but could have said it was repulsive and he would have had the same far-away, no eye contact gaze and robotic response, \"great\". He then disappeared for 20 minutes after our meals were finished. My daughter had left to make business calls in our car, and I had to ask the water server to please chase down the meal server. I would have asked sooner, but a gaggle of four noisy, older male doctors (they were talking about their jobs) were then crammed around the two-top cafe table next to me- with one shaking my hand (?) and chatting with me (I think prompted by pre-meal cocktails elsewhere). Zinc Bistro's French influenced choices seem to be as consistently delicious as remembered, and the weather was beautiful for outdoor dining, but the service was lacking. A $45 lunch without alcohol is not modest in Arizona. Perhaps the bored server needs to \"un-bore\" himself in a job that doesn't require being attentive to customers."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Zinc and it was wonderful!  The service was great and my only complaint is that the seating is not very comfortable (too close to the neighboring tables and the chairs are slightly awkward).....but I will overlook this discomfort for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Great little French bistro in Kierland Commons. Sea Bass, Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is in  Kierland Commons, an upscale mall. It has a noisy main area with a bar and outside seating areas that are quieter. We went there on a Sunday night and the place was half full. The menu is French-like, adapted to the Southwest. After an uninspired paté maison -tons of bread slices, two capers and a bland piece of the paté, I had a wonderful halibut, one of the best I've ever had.  The service was adequate - not great. Seating out in quiet was really nice. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"just had dinner at the zinc bistro and the food was good, but the  management really needs to be improved.  This was a place where i have had numerous good lunches so I knew what was expected. We had our appetizers and drinks without any problems, then the long wait for the entrees occurred with the waiter repeated apologizing and saying the food will be arriving in a moment due to being very busy, but after over an hour these excuses was wearing thin.  No manager in sight and it appears many other patrons were experiencing similar delays. Most upscale restaurants would have a manager offering free drinks desserts or something to make up for the delay . When we left we mentioned to the. hostess our disappointment all she can do is smile and say sorry and many of the other diners also complained but she has no power to do anything.  \"Have a nice day\" attitude  does not deserve another chance."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and just haven't gotten around to writing the review....  Noticed that a number of people rated this place very low.  The only negative thing I have to say is that it is expensive.  But it is in North Scottsdale, in the heart of Kierland.  What did you expect?  I love the pate, and the duck entree is fantastic.  The last time I was there my date had the fish (a special that is not on the menu) that simply melted in your mouth.    I will be back."}
{"text":"Well, when I pay $18 for a glass of sparkling I expect my server to care a little. Asked for check from server assistant, host in ear shot and they said they'd send the server. Well, that never happened. Wasn't busy either. Pass."}
{"text":"We liked the ambiance a lot. It had a cool feel to it. Also, the decor was very French, which we enjoyed.  The food was good, but we are not sure why everything is priced so high? It is definitely more expensive than it should be. $12 for a cup of onion soup? What?!"}
{"text":"Started with an appetizer of pork bellies, which we liked a lot.  And the scallops and halibut were very good.  However, while the filet mignon seemed to be cooked a decent medium, it was very chewy for a $44 menu item.  They can buy a better cut of meat for that price.  So the prices are high for the delivered goods, at least the entrees."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick late lunch based on the good Yelp reviews. It happened to be our anniversary and we had dinner reservations at another restaurant late that night. We ordered a bottle of wine, mussels, and crab crepe - outstanding!!!! The food was absolutely perfect and we were even given a soufflé on the house for our anniversary! The service was above and beyond! We will be back for dinner very soon!"}
{"text":"Zinc is one of our favorites; good food, excellant service..."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with my dinner at Zinc.    Our waiter was cordial but inattentive.  The food presentation is beautiful, but it stops there.  It doesn't matter how good the food \"looks\" if it has no taste.  I ordered the dungeness crab omelet.  It was terrible.  The omelet itself was thick and chewy and the crab I'm  pretty sure came from a can.  I am from theChesapeake Bay area and I know what crab looks and tastes like and I know when it is not fresh.  The good news was that there was maybe a scant tablespoon of it in the omelet.   If you're going to put a crab omelet on the menu I think you should actually put some fresh crab in it. Didn't taste any truffle and the hollandaise was minimal and tasteless.    If you want to \"See and Be Seen\" go to Zinc Bistro for an expensive drink - AFTER you've had a lovely and delicious dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. I have never ordered something that I didn't like. I take my out of town guests here and they all love it too. Highly recommend. I never thought that a french restaurant would be my favorite, but definitely give it a chance."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I really loved the food and staff UNTIL my last visit. There was a man behind the bar being incredibly rude to a few older women at the bar. When interrupted on their behalf I was told to mind my own business! I could not believe it! Then I asked the bartender why they were allowing this to happen and the response I got was \"well he is the owner and does this ALL the time\".  Needless to say, I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Somewhere amidst the warmhearted sunlight and shady palm trees of Phoenix lies a mirage-like discovery: 'Parisians' crowding the perimeter of a corner brasserie, lounging on the terrace, luxuriating in white wine and hearty salads.  The mise en scène conjures up a choice scenario from the legendary Bewitched (1964-1972) starring Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York.1 In Season 2 - Episode 24, \"Samantha, The Dressmaker,\" Samantha and her mother, Endora, take to the streets of Paris for a lunch date at a charming bistro around the corner of Rue de la Paix. 2 Accordingly, the two model regal fashions of the epoch - Samantha's café au lait capeline particularly caught my fancy - but what's equally essential in the iconic moment is Endora's assertion: If you're going to have lunch, have an excellent one.  Zinc Bistro made Food & Wine's Top 10 list of new bistros in North America, and locally earned the title of Best French Restaurant in Phoenix by the Arizona Republic. Tempted by the prospect of a Paris getaway if only for the afternoon, I found Zinc Bistro the ideal location for a bewitching lunch with my mother."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.  Great people watching from the front patio (they have 2) and fantastic service...ALWAYS.  The steamed mussels are fabulous as well all of their salads but my go to lunch item is the basil chicken sandwich.  Incredible!  I will continue to return again and again as it appears that the atmosphere and overall experience is impossible to get burned out on."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some clients, and fell in love with their fries! I think we had sweet potato fries and truffle oil fries, very yummy! Along with the fries that were almost a meal, I had the Zinc house salad with goat cheese, the dressing was so delish! Great spot for lunch or dinner, GREAT decor, very hip!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Top-notch service amazing food a little loud so if you're wanting to have conversation with somebody probably not the place"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of french cuisine, but Zinc is pretty good.  We had their oxtail entree. There was not as much taste to it, not as flavorful as how the Chinese make it. Not sure if that's supposed to be how French makes the oxtail, or just so happen the one we got.  The interior is very nice though, plenty of tables and very well thought out decorations.  Prepare to pay quite a bit (since it is after all a French place)."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the high rating of this restaurant. Frankly it is just okay when it comes to food.  My review is not based on the price since I totally was prepared to pay good money for a good meal.  But the food was underwhelming to say the least.  We ordered:  1 dozen oysters - They are fine.  No complaint  Fragois - very good, perhaps the best dish of the night Pate - Really stale and bitter tasting.  I've had pate in different places - this is by far the worst.    Crab crepe - bland - it has no taste at all and we expected chunks of crab meat but you could have just used imitation crab meat and there is no difference.  The sauce was also bland.  Sea scallop and shrimp - scallops were big but again had absolutely no taste.  The texture suggests that they'd been frozen for a long time.  Shrimps were tiny ones that were fried.  But again, they were not fresh.  This is not what I would expect at a restaurant like this.  I think you can say they are the quality of what you would expect from a cheap Chinese restaurant.  We were beyond disappointed,,,  Short Rib - good  Flat Iron Steak - good  Dessert - they are also fine.  Souffle and semi-fredos were good.  But with the appetizers and main course being disappointing, I won't come back again."}
{"text":"Last night I had the unfortunate experience of choosing this restaurant.  The saying that I learned years ago in the hospitality industry is \"don't fight, make it right\".  Unfortunately, the manager on this particular evening decided the proper way to deal with poor timing standards from his kitchen is to invite my guest and I to leave and go eat pizza or whatever, somewhere else.  The pizza comment I assume came from the fact that it was already about 8:15pm at this point and well over an hour from the moment we walked through the door.  I suppose that I shouldn't expect better from this manager since I am certain he never once \"table touched\" our table and I never saw him walk the floor during the hour plus we sat waiting for food.  The truth is that when I went to personally find him, he was camped out in his office.  I tried sincerely to find the owner Terry Ellisor's contact data as I would have preferred to address this personally, but Mr. Ellisor's team is reticent to give out this type of information and it is pretty difficult to discuss such a management issue with the management.  Mr. Ellisor, I invite you to look at your security tapes for July 23rd."}
{"text":"best croque madame I have ever had.ever. the bread was so soft and came out super warm,it literally melted in my mouth. the sandwich was huge though so make sure you come hungry! I also would recommend the side portion of Mac and cheese. it has Ham in it that is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, and the courtyard seating is really a treat.  I hadn't tried the ahi steak tartare before and I'm a big fan.  Service seems a little disjointed on our last visit:  plates coming to the wrong person, and forgot our souffle order on the shift change.  However they did make up for it with an extra desert, albeit the bread pudding had too much nutmeg for my liking.  Still a great place to experience a modern twist on French cuisine."}
{"text":"I had a lovely time here. Came at 4 pm when their off-hour menu was being served. R had the burger with pomme frites and I had the flat-iron with matchstick fries. It wasn't busy at all so the service was quite good and attentive. The food was excellent. The atmosphere was spot on and romantic in a non-gag way."}
{"text":"Paris In The Desert.  Love this place... just like being in Paris :-) The duck sandwich and chicken salad [ with side of fries in a paper bag ] was delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner at Zinc for Valentine's day dinner. This place is pretty darn authentic to a Parisian Bistro. We ordered the fois gras risotto to start, followed by the onion soup, the poivre steak avec frites, and finished with the souffle chocolate. Over all I would rate the food as some of the best I have ever had. The risotto was AMAZING.  Expect a very delicious, relaxing, high quality meal. This is no place to have a rush meal. Also, don't expect the massive quantities of food you may be used to getting at Cheesecake Factory. But do expect enough tasty, high quality food to be very satisfied.   I would return to the Zinc Bistro again in a heartbeat. Great overall experience. :)"}
{"text":"This atmosphere at Zinc is strangely casual for what many would consider an expensive, upscale restaurant. The walls are busy, the ceiling is jammed with fans and enough lights for you to question why it's dim inside. There is a rather tacky eiffel tower in the center, but the cuisine of this place isn't very French at all.  The food was good, a bit salty, but good. The spinach and frisee salad was very simple. The egg on top was perfectly poached and the dressing was great.   The cheese selection was good, as was the drinks. Some of the meat was improperly served ( cuts that should not be sliced), but tender.   Overall, a good dinner but overpriced IMO. It was not special or delicious enough to warrant the high price tag."}
{"text":"We were a bunch of French people  I must admit the lunch was absolutely fantastic we really enjoy all our meals and the desserts, amazing   Thanks to the chef and to the servers  for the very good service."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever! The food and ambience is perfect. Our server was Mitch...he was very knowledgable and we enjoyed our time. Can't wait to go back! Definitely my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale last week and went out for dinner at Zinc Bistro. (On a technical note, Zinc Bistro really isn't a \"bistro\" but is a \"brasserie\" which is fine as I am a big fan of a good brasserie.   The atmosphere at Zinc Bistro is upscale but not pretentious, warm, inviting and energetic. It was Saturday night and the place was full with a nice mixture of people.   We started out with the mussels and \"matchstick frites\" in white wine, leeks, toasted rosemary and French butter. Absolutely excellent. For our main course we both had the Seared Dry Pack Scallops Risotto. (This dish came so highly recommended, including a recommendation by the couple sitting next to us who couldn't hide their enthusiasm for this dish.)   With our meal we enjoyed a bottle of Delaporte Sancerre. Not only did this Sincerre (which is quickly becoming my new \"go to wine\" ) pair wonderfully with our meal, but at $44 it was a bargain.   Our server was very professional and the kitchen was accommodating. Not only did they split our chocolate souffle, but they cooked our risotto without the Spanish Chorizo it ordinarily comes with.   Zinc will certainly be on my \"must go\" list next time I find myself in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We ordered and our soup was delivered in 30 seconds - no time to even talk. They forgot our appetizer and delivered the main courses within 10 minutes.  Do they microwave everything?  What's the hurry?  We had to send them back and ask for our appetizer first. The fish was dry and the short ribs were like mashed potatoes - obviously over cooked. The waiter wanted to argue with us after we told him about the food quality, with no apology.  A very disappointing and unpleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the best creme brûlée around. I would drive back just for the dessert. #Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Just an excellent experience at this wonderful Scottsdale bistro. Excellent menu but what sets it apart is the service. Frankie is an excellent waiter with a terrific personality and completely knowledgeable of the menu choices. Dylan is the epitome of what a restaurant manager should be. If you have a chance, do not pass up an opportunity to meet these 2 professionals"}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro -- very French.  Indeed a favorite of mine.  Love the onion soup and the chocolate souffle; good bread and French style butter -- a slab -- not that whipped garbage.  I ask for French slab of butter everywhere I eat and some places say it is not available.  I always say \"ask the chef.\" And, suddenly it appears."}
{"text":"Holy cow, if you like French food or even the idea of being in Paris for an evening, this place is a great choice. Inside looks darn near identical to a Parisian brasserie, including the authentic sidewalk cafe bits as well.   The food - incredible! I have had the steak au poivre and the chicken confit, both were amazing. What really shines are the desserts though - the Tahitian vanilla creme brûlée was out of this world. Of course, add on a solid wine list (both with new world and French selections) as well as good champagne choices, and this place is a winner.   Hands down, one of my favorite places in Arizona."}
{"text":"I've been to Zinc Bistro numerous times, and I can't say one negative thing about the food, but after my last service encounter I will say that I will NEVER GO AGAIN. I've sat at the bar and had a fantastic time, the bartenders are fun and the service was great, but my last meal at Zinc was in the normal dining area and I had the most atrocious service imaginable. I believe her name was Lizette (blonde, medium age). She was the kind of waitress I would expect at Denny's on the 3am shift, not at a nicer place in Scottsdale.  She did not check to see how our food was, ask us if we wanted any more beverages and spent more time sneering at me then attending to me.  I will say that the cook who brought us the food was very nice, the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was decent. But I can get that somewhere else. This woman completely turned me off of this place.  On a brighter side: Compliments to the cooks and bartenders! The steak is fantastic, and salads quite good and I really enjoy their martinis as well."}
{"text":"OK, so the reason this review is getting five stars is because I went here for one reason, and ONLY one reason, and that was to try their French Onion Soup.  I saw this reviewed  on \"The Best Things I Ever Ate\" on the Food Channel, and since it is near where my mom lives in North Scottsdale, I decided to give it a try whence I next visited her from Cali.    The soup is without question the best French Onion Soup I've ever had!  The stock had a deep, rich, developed flavor, and was topped with bubbly Gruyere cheese and chive garnish.  The cheese melts over the edge and down the side of the bowl, and scraping it off with the spoon at the end provides a bit of a fun treat - nice caramalized melted cheese snack!  So, based on this one thing, I'll rate it five stars.  It would have been nice to have had the bread served warm, but it's bread - yippee - not the make or break of a meal.  The soup was what this visit was all about, so no need to be overly picky.  Now, having said that, the rest of the menu, while featuring some interesting selections, seems a bit overpriced.  Most of the restaurants in this area are a bit on the pricey side by about 20%, so I can't say that this is a surprise, but it's more than I'd like to spend, even for a quality meal.  The place is fairly noisy for what one might want for an intimate dinner for two, but it is a bistro after all.  The wait staff was very courteous, including the bus people, outgoing and friendly.  One of those in attendance entertained with a story from his past.  When learning I was in from California, he related how he used to play professional soccer and had lived in LA for a time.    Not having had anything but the soup, I might be tempted to rate Zinc Bistro at four stars, but I can't do that in all fairness.  I came expecting an excellent soup, and that's exactly what I got.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Service horrible....Crab crepes inedible....entrees luke warm...way overpriced for what you get...after telling us the food would be just a few more minutes...watched waitress slip out the gate in the courtyard and not return for 10-15 mins food arrived in another 20 mins"}
{"text":"The owner/manager gives French people a bad name  If you want good service Go somewhere else  Xo"}
{"text":"I will agree with most of the reviews so far.   The food was quite good, I had a special, swordfish with gnocchi.  The atmosphere, patio, and appearance is great!  The only drawback is the service.  Our server appeared uninterested and annoyed that we weren't ready to order within five seconds of sitting down.... There's hope though with the food."}
{"text":"The owner is a complete a hole The whole restaurant staff and manager told us he is an alcoholic that beats his wife I live in the kierland flats and have never had worse service in any establishment. The food is nothing great. Feels like you are a tourist in paris during world war 2"}
{"text":"3.5 for my first visit..  I've passed by this place for i don't remember how many times, and it finally came to the time that i decided to try it after several friends' recommendations.   Restaurant decor is pretty standard bistro looking (?), and the little (well, not that small) Eiffel tower in the center gives a bit more of French taste, though i'd much prefer the patio seating with people watching.  Food was great, we had the Scottish Salmon with asparagus and the Braised Lamb Shank. I really liked the salmon, slightly sweet with fresh asparagus, a delight dish with mild flavor. The lamb shank on the other hand was very flavorful, and somehow with the strong lamb taste too...  Now come to dessert, I'm a big fan of souffle, and of course we had to order the chocolate souffle..I was surprised that the waiter offered to split our souffle because they can make it to a smaller size and that takes less time to bake (normal size takes about 25mins)..i mean really? I'd like my regular-sized souffle, please! And to be honest, i've had a lot better ones. This one turned out more like a chocolate cake rather than the soft fluffy souffle, the bittersweetness dark chocolate saved the cake, i couldn't imagine if it's sweet milk chocolate.   I've heard good things about Zinc's lunch, especially the duck sandwich, hmm, I love duck, so it's on my to-go list for 2011!"}
{"text":"I love to go into Zinc in the afternoon and sit at the bar. The staff is very friendly and attractive :) The food is pretty good too but its  a limited menu."}
{"text":"We went here for something most people don't order at a place like Zinc...the mac 'n cheese, which is becoming an increasingly popular item there. I was told it was the best in the valley. It was a great, comforting rendition to be sure, but I've made better myself. My friend ordered the dry packed scallops, which were delicious, but again, nothing to write home about. All in all, it felt a bit like zinc is trying to hard, or just can't decide of it's a quaint cafe/bistro, or wannabe fine dining. This feeling was reinforced by the holier than thou attitudes of the staff, and the very \"rushed\" vibe we got when dining an hour before closing."}
{"text":"Take your lover or BFF for the dinner for two on the patio in March.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Their duck, foie, steak, lamb... I've tryed and loved it all.  Only other five star in Phoenix (NOCA is the other) for me..."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is home to the best burger I've ever had. It's so good that every time I've visited, I put nothing on it. The Zinc Burger does not deserve to be tarnished by other ingredients. It's perfect as it is & I've enjoyed it that way since 2004. And if you're not in a burger mood, the Mac & Cheese is excellent! As I love to write on the paper table mats whenever I eat there ¡Viva Matt Carter!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch. Cute atmosphere and decorated nice around the holidays. My fav is the ham omelette with potatoes that reminded me of scallop potatoes. Outdoor courtyard in middle of rest cute. Definitely senior citizen crowd though and the inside smelled like it too last time I went.  I think fluke. I drank at the bar one time w friend and had good time."}
{"text":"OK, This is my wife and I's absolute favorite date night destination, when we can afford it.  Even then we usually just sit on the patio and order a glass of wine, the amazing cheese platter app and then share a french press pot of coffee while we wait for the bake-to-order chocolate sufle' with choice of toppings.  I would add that the back patio is probably the most romantic dining space in North Scottsdale. We usually prefer to sit out on the front patio and people watch. I have eaten diner here twice and both times where very good. A bit noisy on this inside and your going to feel real unconfortable if you bring the kiddos."}
{"text":"A staple favorite restaurant for me. Always a St. Germaine cocktail and I die for their flat iron steak au poivre style with fries. It is always cooked to a perfect medium rare. Super flavorful. I usually start with a French onion soup (which was featured on the food network) or the mussels. Everything is made in house. Oh and make sure you save room for their perfectly cooked french soufflé, cheesecake or beignets. They always have good music playing the nights I'm in with a fun bar atmosphere. Beautiful heated court yard or dining room if you prefer."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in maricopa county bar none. If you know French food at all this is it."}
{"text":"I decided to take the wife out on a \"date\". Zinc Bistro was the choice for dinner. Used Opentable for the reservation, flawless. We were seated right away and Sally our waitress was very good. We were in the courtyard to start but with the threat of rain she moved us inside.  We had the iceberg salad and onion soup for starters. And for entrees the flat iron steak with pomme frites and the short ribs with a potato gratin. WE shared a lemon souffle for dessert. The food was delicious. The portion of the short ribs seemed small until you realize the bones have been removed, all meat. But be aware the gratin has a strong nutmeg flavor. I liked it but was turned down by my wife.  My only disappointment was the background music selections. The decor is french bistro'ish, the food is french influenced then tell me why I had to listen to base pounding club music while eating dinner? Not the kind of background tunes you expect with this atmosphere. They should at least take note of the music they play on their website. I gave experience a 4 star because there are no half stars. Change the tunes and it's a solid 4 star."}
{"text":"Gist:    Classy food and atmosphere at a reasonable price.   Service was decent.   Only downside is that the food is on the salty side.  As out-of-towners during Thanksgiving we weren't really sure what to expect from Zinc Bistro.  But the review here looked great and we were staying across the street so we decided to give it a shot.  And I am REALLY glad we did.    Its got a good vibe to it - classy, but not stuck up, dim lighting so its kind of romantic, but spacious so you don't feel like you're right next to your fellow diners.      The dungeness crab crepe was amazing.  Two little crepes in a lobster sauce, a perfect appetizer size so you don't feel stuffed after the first course.  Definitely leaves you wanting more.     The purpose of this review is really to mention the Filet Mignon Sous Vide.  It was the most tender, flavorful mignon we have every had!  Granted I don't get filet very often, but for $30 something, I couldn't pass it up.  Our waitress kindly explained the Sous Vide cooking method.  The meat is slow cooked in a vacuum sealed bag, keeping all the juices soaked in the meat.  Delicious!   Must try it!  We also had a french onion soup as well as the pork tenderloin.  I must say the downfall of this place is that their food is on the overly salty side.    So just prepare to drink a lot :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. Often at lunch my wife and I will split the flat iron steak and fries which is only on the dinner menu but is still available."}
{"text":"I stopped at the restaurant while shopping with my girlfriend. We both split the crab salad and a chicken curry on rye sandwich. The coffee was delicious and nicely presented. Nice atmosphere and quite busy at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Very good, but not as good as it once was.  A few years ago I would of given 5 stars.  Great oysters.  The cheese, fruit and nut appetizers are still wonderful.  When making a reservation, make sure to ask for courtyard seating."}
{"text":"Ok food here, probably living a little too large off the tourist traffic in Keirland Commons. Had the fois gras raviolli, it was pretty so so - not enough goose to make up for all the pasta; the duck consume with it was very good. My wife's French onion soup was good by her account, I thought the smoked gruyere cheese overwhelmed the flavor. The main course was good, pretty small portion though. I had the RACK of lamb, which was two cutlets with a couple of bites of lamb belly. Both had a nice taste. My wife had the short ribs which were pretty good, had a nice slow cooked taste to them. For dessert we shared the beignets, which were very average. And where I previously read that there French press coffee was THE bomb, I thought it bombed. It hardly had a coffee flavor, it was made very weak. Overall, I'd give Zinc 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to go for an experience! Typically good service and the food is always very good. If the weather is nice sit out on the garden patio."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. It's a bit on the expensive side but worth it. The service is quick and attentive. I give it only 4 stars because there are other places that out shine Zinc. Try the duck confi or the curry chicken salad, you will not be sorry"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been going to Zinc for several years and look forward to going for years to come.   It's dark?  Well yeah, that's the point! Those who are uncomfortable in the \"beautiful people\" world of North Scottsdale will not be happy. BTW they have someone the best bartenders in town. Go on a Friday afternoon/evening, sit at the corner of the bar and have fun."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was really excited about this restaurant because the French Onion Soup made it onto Food Network. Le boyfriend said he was impressed (although it took the 2nd try since the first try the cheese was not completely over the soup). So the mission was accomplished! In addition, the food was superb!  Excellent location and I'm impressed that there was an alternate option to chain upscale restaurants in the Kierland Commons area. The food was all very yummy--from the dungeness crab salad, dungeness crepe, duck confit sandwich all in a casual atmosphere. They ask if you want fries for your order and unless you have more than 2 people or really like fries, it's a lot of fries although they are delicious. The chocolate cake dessert that my boyfriend and I had was also worth saving room for! We will definitely be back! There is also a 10% discount if you stay at the Westin Kierland!"}
{"text":"Stopped in randomly for lunch with my dad, and had an AWESOME meal! The decor is super cute and instantly makes you feel as though you've been transported to a bistro in Paris. The menu is sophisticated (but isn't stuffy), and they actually serve French cuisine - not some American idea of French food.  Try: The salad with salmon puff pastries (can't remember the name!)"}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of my favorite culinary experiences!  The French Onion soup is simply superb!!!!"}
{"text":"A week old review but nonetheless we must give Zinc their props for A+ quality ingredients in traditional recipes and mostly an extra half a star for keeping my mobile that I left at the dinner table and realized was misplaced over an hour after my departure...Oops, kudos to the front of the house and we'll be back for a late nite snack of truffle fries for sure!   Hubby enjoyed his protein & foie combo, however the Madeira sauce was a bit too prevalent in the dish for me, but I was quite content with my own selection. The broth was divine and quality of mussels sourced from the great Washington coast added points to the dish for nostalgia (having called the Puget Sound area home for some years.)  Reservations are a must for weekends and be prepared for intimate seating as I've enjoyed in many a Parisien bistros. I miss the selection along the rue Saint Martin but if I can't have Alain Ducasse in AZ, I'll continue to be a beggar and not a chooser!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 45 minutes for a sandwich and fries. Asked the waitress what the hold up was and was told we were up next. After another 15 minutes flagged down the waitress and were told it was coming right up. We told her we would wait 5 more minutes and then we would leave. After an hour, still no lunch. Stopped and told the girl seating guests what happened and were told we should have found her to tell her. No apology. What?  Won't be there again."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner and service! Ate here with a friend last night for my birthday. Sparkler candle was a great touch, along with the amazing chocolate soufflé.  For dinner had the flat iron steak, which was super tender and very flavorful. The server paired my steak with a fabulous wine. It was perfect! Can't wait to go back and order the same thing! I would also like to request the same server as well!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The fist time I went with my husband for dinner. It was the first place we dined after moving here from Chicago. As always we started with the oysters which were good quality and delicious. He loved his French Onion Soup as well. I had a special, the Halibut which had a lovely and inventive presentation. The only issue was the seasoning. I do not think it was seasoned at all. My husband had the same issue with the Short Ribs.  Maybe the kitchen just missed a step.  I do not like things over seasoned but this was bland.  The  Zinc Valrona Chocolate Souffle was simply amazing. I am not a chocolate lover, except for souffle. It was the perfect exclamation point to our dinner.   I went for lunch with my mother who only eats plain burgers, plain chicken and pasta with marinara. I don't know how she manages to stay thin. We settled on Zinc. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a lovely arugula and tomato and a light sauce.  She of course had a plain burger which she raved about.  We split an order of frites, that were crisp and full of flavor. I loved the spicy sauce!   I love the bistro decor and the service was good on both trips.  Glad I live close!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here on Thursday Evening with a Party of 9.   I had French Onion Soup, Pome Puree,  A 5 derivative cheese board, Watermelon Three ways Foie Gras, Truffle Omelet, and the Mussels.  A bottle of cote de rhone with a glass of Bordeaux, and the Souflette and Creme Brulee with ice wine for desert.  Sat and dialoged with a St Germaine Cocktail following.    Very good food, feels maybe a tinge less hipster the house brasserie(it's in kierland so nice coupling with this decision),  come here if you're starving and feeling hedonistic.  It doesnt get the justice it deserves if you come here for one dish.  Definite 5 star and a great dining experience.  Chef Carter and his peers have great concepts.  I had a taste of my friends filet & foie with reduction and it's baiscally hedonism as a dish.  Be prepared to sleep like a baby after and eat veggies only for the next 48 hours."}
{"text":"Definitely not \"a taste of Paris\".  This is just another over-priced, trying to be trendy Scottsdale restaurant.  Cold sour dough bread with even colder butter was the first hint.  The pate had so little taste to it it's no wonder they had little dollops of spicy mustard to go with it.  The chicken was tough and whatever the melange of things that came with it was just didn't help or work at all.  Don't bother!"}
{"text":"On so many levels, this is THE place to go when in the neighborhood.  Why?  Because it is always sincerely friendly, has a great French atmosphere, has wonderful food, and a really good bar.  Then add to that they can make excellent espresso drinks to go with their superb deserts.  (I find that very few places can make espresso to rival that found in Europe)  The street-side patio is also well designed and comfortable.  Another comment seems appropriate here. My wife and I have been regulars at Zinc Bistro for about four years.  Yes, we did have one incredibly clueless waitress one time out of all the times we have dined there.  But we also have had occasion to observe some of the best customer service in town, as was the case when we met our son's family of four there for dinner, but arrived 40 minutes late due to a freeway accident.  I apologized profusely upon arrival. But they said everything was OK, and that our grandchildren had been given Shirley Temples, and that my usual Saphire martini was just taken to our table (prompted by my son).  Of all the very good restaurants in Scottsdale, I put Zinc Bistro up there with the very best.  What are the other best places in town?  Please see my other reviews."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the service prompt and friendly, and the coq au vin is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place and not just because it was the site of my 1st date with my BF.  It's quaint, romantic, and the food is generally excellent though we tend to order the same things every time - truffle pomme frites with 3 dipping sauces including house made ketchup, frisee salad, oysters, and any of their souffles.    The bar is fun though it can get loud.  We generally avoid the dining room unless we can sit next to the windows or the mini Eiffel Tower.  Several of the tables have an unpleasant view of the service area and are in the pathway of the restrooms.  Our favorite is the garden patio which has great ambiance with nicely situated tables, twinkle lights, plants, heaters or misters depending on the season.  Very romantic if you're not sitting near some of the loudmouth Scottsdalites who apparently are 'regulars.'  The front and side patios are fun too - great for people watching.    Service is generally good but can be spotty in the dining room. That's the only reason it's not 5 stars for me.  There's a great waitress on the patio - tiny, blond young woman whose name escapes me.  She knows the menu, always has great recommendations and is incredibly attentive to all her tables. Bar service is always fantastic.  So happy to have this has our neighborhood French place - great food, great ambiance, great people!"}
{"text":"The appetizer french fries were tasty, esp. with the sauces that accompanied it. For lunch, I had the duck confit sandwich. Great flavor! I'll have to go back and try out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This was a treat. I had the mussels as recommended by another reviewer. I didn't even think I liked mussels but the sauce was incredible. Followed by the Dungeness crab crepes and finished with a green salad. Service was lovely. I was so happy to find this gem amongst the expected high end chain restaurants found in every city. I will definitely be back if I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"This may be the best kept secret in North Scottsdale.  It's petite location and dining area is easy to miss.  Located within a outdoor mall, it's easy to drive this place and never visit.  I finally gave it a try, after meeting one of it's chefs at a Baseball game.   Boy, I'm glad that I did.   The food was amazing, and for not having a children's menu, the waitstaff was uber attentive to my children's wants.  Everything we ordered was fantastic.  One of my kids ordered the Mussels.  I tried one.  The mussels were divine, and the broth flavorful.  The grilled shrimp were of hearty size, and the side of mac and cheese was awesome.  My other child ordered the pork-chop, and I'm not a pork guy, but my wife said is was the best she ever tasted.  Many dishes you'll find elsewhere, but the play with unusual ingredients really works.  I ordered a wedge salad to start, and thought that the added toppings would take away from the overall wedge experience.  But I was wrong.  The toppings really worked and it was the best wedge salad that I've ever had. The filet topped with foie gras was simply to die for.  My wife said that her chicken dish was great.    Frankie, our server, was simply the best, and I would recommend that you ask for him.  He knew the menu well, and knew what our children would enjoy.  Thanks, Frankie, if you read this.  The overall experience was a 10 out of 10.  We will be back.  A special thanks to Chef Martin.   Had I not run into him at that baseball game, I wouldn't have known about this little gem of a restaurant.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat when I come to Scottsdale. The fries and aioli are to die for. I love the Chicken, Pesto & Brie Sandwich! Zinc's is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Everything my wife and I had was fantastic. Also our first time trying foie gras which is now my number one favorite food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for a good night out with friends with great food after reading the reviews. Visited on September 6th and won't be back. From the second we arrived I could tell that wasn't going to happen. It was pouring rain and when we walked in the hostess had her back to us and was having casual conversation with another staff member. She made eye contact and kept right on talking. When she finally stopped talking to her friend she didn't even say may I help you just looked at us like we ruined her night. Told her we were meeting friends there and gave her the number of people and the name and she corrected me because I was off a number and said that \"party has already been seated\". Duh! that's why we said we were meeting people there. She walked us half way to the table and said they should be in the back on the right, which was wrong but we found them anyway since the place is so small but would it have killed her to walk us to our table. Our waiter was only half bad and just seemed overwhelmed which I won't fault him for because they did get busy but I only received one refill on my glass water after asking twice and the wait time for our food took longer than it should have for what we ordered. The food was just ok nothing to write home about. My husband ordered a simple salad and was the last one at the table to be served.  My salmon was cooked so oddly (over cooked in some spots undercooked in others) I only ate half. I usually will give a place two tries before writing them off because everyone can have an off night, but I was not impressed at all and won't be back"}
{"text":"Onion soup was very good but at $12?  Coco vin was good, but not great.  Service and atmosphere were both good.  Priced too high.  Will try another place next time when I'm at Kierland Commons."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here!  The food is French with a modern flair, ambience is fabulous whether you dine inside, on the outdoor patio or in the garden courtyard.  Excellent service and delicious food with a nice variety of wines.  Lunch is lovely, but the garden courtyard takes on a romantic quality at night with the twinkle lighted trees. A sure bet!"}
{"text":"I can't count how many birthdays I've spent here or how many times I've dined here just because I needed a little pick me up. It's like a little slice of Paris in Scottsdale. I've actually been to Paris three times, and have not encountered a more delectable cheese board than at Zinc Bistro. To say I love this place would be an understatement."}
{"text":"5 stars! We had French onion soup, curry chicken salad sandwich and beignets. The three dipping sauces with the beignets were all delicious. French press coffee was amazing. Spectacular service."}
{"text":"Great service! Diverse menu! Fun location! My lovely bride & I make this an anniversary destination but we keep promising ourselves we'll visit more frequently. Tonight we threw caution to the wind and split Le Grand! So fresh & well-prepared. Don't forget the onion soup app! Big shout out to Frankie; a waiter with an understanding of excellent service, professionalism, empathy, and the intangibles that separate great waiters from the good ones."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that has been on my list of places to try so when a friend suggested meeting here for lunch, I was ready!  My husband started with the French onion soup which he said was full of onions, cheese, and flavor.  He then had the chicken salad sandwich which he said was very good.  I had the \"cool Dungeness crab, lime, pickle, chopped egg salad\".  It came on a very long plate which made the portion size look bigger than it was (it was still a good-sized salad).  The salad was very good, although it could've used more crab in it.  We had to request bread, which was yummy.    I really enjoyed lunch here, although lunch for the two of us did cost more than the dinner we had in Glendale a few hours later.  I will definitely be back, but it'll have to be a special occasion in order to justify the cost."}
{"text":"My roomie and I decided to go shopping at Kierland mall to torture and remind ourselves about all the money we DONT have.... And despite the holes in our pockets we decided to still divulge in the holes in our stomachs. A girl's gotta eat! We ended up at Zinc Bistro which is a french inspired restaurant. My roomie is vegetarian so she got a boring dish(the house salad) and I got the bistro boulliaise( I cant spell) and it was DELICIOUS! risotto and this soup and scallops, rock shrimp, and salmon although I did substitute salmon with more scallops. Service was decent and I loved the atmosphere. Not too over the top despite the uh giant lit up Eiffel Tower in the middle of the restaurant... Everything went well and I would love to go back there soon!"}
{"text":"Best truffle fries and biengnets in town.  Their menu is delicious, no matter what you order.  Even if you don't understand the menu, order it, you won't disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never gotten anything here that I didn't enjoy.  If you're there on a cold day try the French Onion Soup.  It is delicious.  Probably not a place I'd take my little kids though."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars years ago when it first opened, however it has been going down hill fast!! Ever since the old miserable woman who \"runs\" the place in between the bottles of wine she drinks while on duty took over, I've seen a drastic change. I wish the owner could see she is running the place into the ground. Her pissy attitude wears off on the servers in turn causing an overall bad experience for the guest. I have seen her yell and scream at the hostesses and at one point saw her push one. This was one of my favorite places until recently. Whoever owns the place needs to look at these reviews and realize she is killing your business!"}
{"text":"Cosy and romantic and a cool bar to grab a drink. The deserts are to die for! Didn't try the food! :-)"}
{"text":"I was taken here because of the French onion soup, and liked it, but honestly on parity with others. I like their creative \"bistro\" takes on certain foods (very good tuna), but it seems like the portions are tapa sized. Appeals very strongly to scottsdale-ites I'm sure, but if you don't have money to blow then pass this place up because they have exorbitant prices because of commercial rent they must pay."}
{"text":"Decent french bistro.  The Parmesan truffle fries are delicious the Monte Cristo is excellent.  Great place to have a nice lunch outside and people watch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places here.  I ordered the Zinc burger and a side a macaroni and cheese, a change up for me here.  They have a large bar selection, and Chimay beer on tap.  My sister loves their French onion soup, and of course the frites."}
{"text":"After days sight seeing the Grand Canyon, Navajo National Monument, Monument Valley, Canyon De Chelly, Petrified Forest/Painted Dessert, Sedona and eating okay food - Zinc Bistro hit the spot.    Ordered the french onion soup and duck sandwich.  Both of them were great!"}
{"text":"Over-priced and over-rated!  So disappointed.  In from San Diego and had heard good things.  Setting is cute, food is mediocre.  Short ribs fatty, moules, too much rosemary, salmon, fine, wine selection limited.  Chocolate souffle probably best part but at $200 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome service and delicious food. We love the cheese platter for an appetizer. This last time we were there they surprised us with a delicious chocolate souffle for dessert since they knew it was our anniversary. Also, they have an awesome garden patio!"}
{"text":"I took my mother in law to Zinc Bistro tonight to celebrate her 5 year anniversary of being cancer-free and it was simply devine. Our waiter, Frank, was helpful and friendly, but not pushy. We ordered two glasses of champagne which was crisp and refreshing. We had the wedge salad and crab crepes. The salad was perfect and the crepes were exquisite. We finished our dinner with the chocolate soufflé which was the perfect dessert. Overall, we had a charming and delicious dinner celebration. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Today was second visit. Last time I enjoyed the Mussels a lot so I ordered them again. The Bistro is a beautiful place and I wish I could say the food was the same. Maybe today they had different chef as my mussels were very bland neither were they nice and plump by smallish and shriveled. My husband ordered their famous onion soup which was salty and sour. He sent it back all disappointed as he loves the soup.  Our service was very good! Won't be back."}
{"text":"A really great way to end our vacation.  Service by Martin was exceptional and garden courtyard beautiful.  Both appetizers were delicious, braised oxtail with homemade pasta and duck-pork pate.  Generous portion of pate nicely plated, would have loved a little more of the pasta with the flavorful oxtail.  All three entrees fantastic - beef cheeks, flat iron steak and duck confit.  Big flavors in sauces and moist perfectly cooked meats.  Tried the French Merlot from their carafe program, definitely needed the carafe airing as it was a young 2016.  Enjoyed the chocolate  soufflé to end the meal and nice they will split into two smaller ones to cook faster.  Only disappointment all night was they brought chocolate sauce and we requested gran marinier, really would have liked the orange-chocolate pairing.  Wish we had something like Zinc in our hometown with this level of quality service, food and atmosphere at affordable pricing."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch on the dog friendly patio.  The food was excellent and the service was very good!   Can't wait to go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Service was a joke. It truly, absolutely took 11 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge my presence.   No happy hour menu.   \"Communal bar table\" is a great idea but situated that you get bumped in to by staff with no apology. Or at least I didn't.  Food is good but no thanks. Won't return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the Valley.  True French atmosphere and a nice bright courtyard.  I've always had great service and food.  I mostly go for lunch as it can get $$$$ but if you get what you pay for, this place certainly provides excellent quality."}
{"text":"Like many other reviews, the experience depends A LOT on your server. The first time we went we had Frankie. He was incredible!!! Attentive, knowledgeable, and has a great personality. We returned a few weeks later and had the opposite experience. The hostess was rude (and a bit trashy) and the service was terrible. The food is great either way, but to give Zinc 5 stars, they need to have more consistency from their staff."}
{"text":"Wow ! Love this place. The mussels are amazing . My favorite birthday spot !!  Dessert, wine, service, it's all wonderful :)"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale on business and my hotel recommended the restaurant. I had the misfortune of eating here for lunch based on that suggestion.  We both ordered the French Onion Soup. When the description includes \"Bubbling Gruyere\" you expect the cheese to be hot, and melted. It came out as a congealed lump of cheese on the top of warm soup. The only flavor that I could detect from the soup was salt. It wasn't overly salty, I just didn't taste any of the other flavors I've normally had in such a soup.  For my main course, I was considering multiple options and the server recommended the duck confit. I've had it many times at other restaurants. (If you're in LA, I would recommend checking out Bouchon in Beverly Hills.) The duck confit came out and it was incredibly dry and stringy. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't eat any more of it.  Between the two of us, we ate about half of our soups, and I ate one bite of the sandwich. No one asked us how our meals were, or even noticed that 90% of my sandwich remained uneaten.  Had it not been for how quaint the restaurant is, or its central location, it would have gotten just one star instead."}
{"text":"MIght very well be my favorite place to people watch in AZ.  Post up at the Zinc bar with your girl and a martini on a Friday night and just watch the people.  Wonderful place.  Get the French Onion soup."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu"}
{"text":"Just ate here  atmosphere was wonderful, the onion soup IS NOT THE BEST ITS JUST OK  The truffle fries great the pate app also very good good drinks great bartender and the cheese plate was excellent it's not cheap but it's good value I would say when in Scottsdale TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"This place was better than expected. It is small but nicely done. The prices are not too high, and I could see myself coming back to sit at their tables outside.  This inside is dark and very bar like, yet hip & comfortable enough. The outside patio is nice, lush and well done, but both areas are very small. We had to play musical plates, glasses (well everything that was on the table) as we were being served our main course. There is just not enough room on the tables and they have gigantic plates - not much thought put into that one.  But in general it was nice, the food was good (not great) and the prices were not too crazy - although paying $10 for a \"large\" avian water is totally ridiculous!  If you go, sit on the patio. It is a pleasant experience. They have mirrors, plants, misters/heaters and candles everywhere - really nicely done and has a romantic ambiance."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I had the onion soup and ravioli with oxtail! Raw bar is excellent even coming from New England. If you go, ask to sit in the courtyard; the ambience is incredible. Service and food was amazing! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Was at Zinc again last night and have to say the place keeps getting better still.  Started with the crepes again, perfect again.  Then shared the scallops and lamb shank for dinner.  I'm not usually a huge fan of lamb OR scallops but they were recommended and I was feeling adventurous.  The lamb -  AMAZING.  Melt in your mouth wonderful.  More like a stew than anything with classic fall off the bone tender meat over creamy cheesy polenta.  Their bread is perfect French bread too.  This time of year (winter) there is a festive, buzzy energy with a good crowd but not TOO long of a wait.  Make reservations though for sure.  Oh, and Bobby's across the way in Kierland is a nice spot for a pre-dinner drink (400s Hollywood glamour meets The Jetsons with cool live jazz your parents or grandparents would have enjoyed back in the day)."}
{"text":"We've been to Zinc one before for lunch and left with a good enough impression to try it again for dinner.  Our server recommended the Dover scallops, so I ordered that.  I have been to many restaurants in and out of the states and I have to say that the flavor was good, but for a $40+ plate, the portion size was ridiculous.  You basically get 3 scallops - small in size - and a small fried shrimp on each.  Each scallop sat on a bit of slightly undercooked and acidic risotto.  I left hungry and frustrated.  Presentation was great but that didn't help.    Soufflé was amazing, not too sweet but I just couldn't get over the entree size."}
{"text":"Got seated right away (had reservations) 20 mins to get drinks  25 mins after that to get cheese plate 25 mins after finished with cheese plate to get soup/salad 18 mins to get entree after finishing soup. Scallops came out cold.  They replaced it in less than 3 mins (food for me, bad for someone else).  Vegetarian option is 1 pasta dish or salad...no ability to make a veggie plate.    Really need better wait staff.  Doubt we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Get the mussels.   Really, be sure you get the mussels. Oh, and I dare you not to pick up the bowl and drink the white wine/butter/garlic broth. Amazing.  I recently had a great business dinner here. Everyone was happy. I enjoyed their flat iron steak, which was recommended by our waiter. My guests had the filet mignon and the scallops.   All of this, plus some great wine ... it was a good night out!  If the weather is nice, sit on the back patio. It's gorgeous and will make that Bistro name come to life!"}
{"text":"If I had never gone to this place for lunch this would probably be a four star review. Unfortunately, my last two experiences have been 2-star lunch time experiences. It's lunch, people! We don't have time to wait 45 minutes for our food!   Both times the servers took their sweet time acknowledging that we'd been seated. Both times the food was ultra slow coming out (I actually thought the girl forgot to put the order in the first time this happened). A couple months ago I sent a drink back because there was a bug in the glass and the waitress actually rolled her eyes at me. This time even the food was mediocre - over-broiled onion soup and over-dressed salad that, despite the very fancy description, was just a Caesar salad. Oh, and they forgot to bring the drinks for half our party.   My recommendation - go for dinner and stay far far away from lunch. The dinner menus is better and they usually have great specials. The wine list is worth checking out. And it seems they put their more experienced (or just their less apathetic) servers on the dinner shift.  Also a bright spot - the food runners and bus staff. More than once now they have offered to go get my server or check on my food. I feel bad, because they probably get tipped out off the crappy tips that people leave the wait staff."}
{"text":"They put paprika on the frites and have American flags behind the bar. 50% French 50% ?  For real French food check out the French grocery on 7th ave in downtown Phoenix. They didn't have as much $ to sink into the ambiance, but quality is top notch."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Zinc recently on a first date. At first I was a little apprehensive, expecting a hoity toity atmosphere and snobby employees, but I am pleased to agree with other reviewers that that was simply not the case.   It was pretty quiet when we arrived around 8pm on a Tuesday, but we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and given a nice little \"date table\" on their patio.   I started with a delicious glass of Sauvignon Blanc; my date had a Pinot Noir. Our server recommended the ahi tuna \"steak tartare\" appetizer which was absolutely yummy. I was a little sketched out to see it served with rye bread, but somehow all the flavors meshed very well together.   After debating between the salmon and the scallops, I went with the latter. I am a huge sucker for scallops *wink wink nudge nudge to any prospective dates ;)* To be honest I'm not even sure what all the pretty sauces and garnishes on my plate were, but I liked it! I know the black sauce was squid ink, after being cautioned by our server that it has a distinct taste that you either like or you don't. I didn't find it to be offensive, and actually dipped one of my lightly breaded shrimp in it. The scallops themselves were very good. I cleaned my plate! (Is that bad first date manners? I couldn't help it!)  My date had the flat iron steak which came served with truffle fries. He's a Zinc \"regular\" and claims the steak is his favorite thing off the menu. I didn't try it, not a huge red meat eater. But I did steal a few fries which were tasty with their house made ketchup.   It was a very pleasant dining experience, unfortunately I didn't save room for dessert. Our server was there when we needed her and absent when we didn't. The busboy was prompt with water refills and removing dirty plates. Although Zinc has a heftier price tag than I'd probably pay for myself, I'd go again if asked on a second date!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous patio weather! Had a French press coffee which was very good to start lunch with.  Very attentive and on point service especially with the table assistants.  I ordered the Ham and Gruyere omelette with a Radish Frisée and potato strings.  I am insufferably picky about how two things are prepared 1) steaks 2) eggs!  The omelette was absolutely perfect fluffy yet substantial and the ham was perfectly carved and more authentic than the usual deli meat tasting cubes that are usually tossed into omelettes.  The salad was very good my only complaint was the potato strings are more of a garnish as they are tasteless and awkward to eat.  My friend had the Avocado, Marcona almond, shaved red onion, tomato, ricotta salad with cool Dungeness crab, lime pickle and chopped egg....delicious! Very fresh, colorful and crisp.  Next time I have to order like a cliche American tourist and try their Croque Monsieur (France's version of a grown up ham and cheese sandwich) I haven't had one since I was in France."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with Mom before a long road trip home. Now I can't wait to go back when I'm in town again!   The house frites were soooo good. Crispy and well seasoned. I'm a big fan!  If you're looking for a good salad, try the spinach & frisee salad. I had a similar salad at Mon Amie Gabie in Vegas so I thought I'd give this one a go. The dressing wasn't as good but this was definitely a great salad. I'm a poach-egg-on-things type of girl so this was right up my alley. I even saved a couple lardons for my puppy. She sat quietly through the whole meal and was rewarded for her behavior. Scottsdale is definitely a dog town, most of the stores in this area had dog bowls full of water for their patrons.  I hope to get back here on a Sunday before 2:00 so I can take advantage of their brunch. A couple at a nearby table had great looking plates of food. Don't worry, I didn't ask them for a bite. I wanted to but didn't."}
{"text":"My first five star in Scottsdale...if you love classic French bistro fare...sautéed Fois Gras, pommel frites double fried...bistro salads etc this delivers at highest level.  I had a bone-in pork steak that was the best entree of the year...heirloom Berkshire beastly ribeye that was heaven...almost as heavenly as their Fois Gras...ooh la la.  Wine list was not five star but there are so few wine lists in AZ that are J don't hold it against them.  Loud and boisterous as many French bistro's are in France...this was a trip to Paris without the long plane ride. Tres magnificent!"}
{"text":"My favorite French bistro even if the food is a little too much \"evolution\" to be real French! Products/offers are great and very creative. Wine choice is a little limited but prices are honest. Our waitress Maria was great: attentive, fast and lovely. A place where we love to come back over and over."}
{"text":"Wow. Just happened by this place with my friends. We were seated quickly right in the middle by a cool lit up eifel tower. Loved the ambiance and the food was AMAZING!!! A little pricey with small portions but so elegantly prepared. We waited a little longer than usual between appetizers, main course, and dessert, but it was worth it, and it was also a busy Saturday night. Everyone was friendly, the food was to die for, and the decor and atmosphere was so very nice."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but it has really gone downhill. We went here tonight to celebrate our anniversary and birthday, which we made reservations for earlier. I ordered the salmon, which was overcooked (I had to use a knife to cut it) and smelled extremely fishy. My husband ordered the scallops, which were okay. He ordered an iced tea and never received one refill, even after asking 3 different staff members. We made reservations and you would think they would even mention happy birthday or happy anniversary, but not one comment. When we left no one said have a good night or anything. Not a friendly environment and the food was less than mediocre. Not that it mattered to them, they didn't even come by our table to ask how it was. Our server took our order and that's it, he was gone the entire time. Just a total lack of common courtesy and is sad that this establishment lost its charm."}
{"text":"OMG.  This was amazing. I hardly remember what I ate in specifics (it was the day we made a transatlantic move) but my mouth is salivating just thinking about my return when we visit for a family wedding in the fall.  It was a Thursday for lunch. The restaurant was rather quiet, the service a little slow and it was HOT outside. I had a glass of wine to sip and enjoy and my husband decided to go with the onion soup just because. It's a French bistro, you have to. It was by far the best onion soup we've tasted. And we went to Paris last year for our anniversary.  Croquet monsieur was definitely the pick of the afternoon and amazing. The chocolate soufflé was to die for and all I want to do is take that restaurant and relocate it to my new city in England."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last year. I had walked by here numerous times and always wanted to eat here. Finally I did. The restaurant is pricey for dinner. If you want just a taste of it I recommend going for lunch. However, for dinner it was pretty good. Everything was a la carte of course and the mac and cheese was very good. They were also really accommodating of my sister who eats gluten free.   I think it is too pricey for dinner and I was not totally blown away. I am eager to get back and try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"We have eaten as Zinc several times with a consistent amazing experience.  We enjoyed oysters, crepes, flat iron steak and frittes in our last visit.  All were well prepared and very tasty.  We closed out our meal with the choc souffle and were pleasantlysurprised by the best bottle of red wine I have had in years.   Sean the bartender took care of us.  A great experience and one of my favorite stops for thies foodee."}
{"text":"had a fantastic/delicious experience at zinc. i went with a friend for lunch, we were seated promptly and our charming and downright adorable server, aubrey, was helpful and wonderful. she made great wine pairing suggestions and made the experience delightful.  as a non-meat eater, i had to be choosy, but the kitchen seemed accommodating and everything was divine. down to the last bite of two mouth-watering desserts."}
{"text":"OMG my friends ... Zinc Bistro was dynamic from beginning to end !  Service and management were spot on ! We started with cocktails and Pork belly appetizer followed by a cup of onion soup and house salad .  Our featured entrees ...Ricotta Gnocchi ,and hubby had  Beef Cheeks . Each dish was a plethora of popping, bursting flavor ! Dessert? Absolutely, we had Chocolate Scuffle! It was everything and more  expect to spend around $150 .00 for two . as always if you go let me know . Enjoy"}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is an interesting French brasserie style restaurant. They clearly went out of their way to give it a French feel with the interior decor. We had reservations, and were seated at a nice table in the back near the kitchen. We had a team of two servers (apparently they were training a new one), which was fine. Both very sociable.   I ordered lamb shanks, and my mum ordered the scallops. To start we had the Zinc House Salad, which we asked to be split, and they did into two places (plus points for this). We ordered wine with dinner (I had a Bordeaux and mum had Vouvray), both our selections. The food was excellent. My lamb shanks were tender, and had a very tasty sauce. The scallops were also very tasty and the sauce it was in was very good.   As we were dining, mum noticed that the banquette was dusty. We could see this because the sun was just at the right angle. This was a major issue at the prices we were paying for this meal, and really is a ding that this restaurant could have easily avoided (by dusting the banquettes daily??).   Positives:  Great food, good service, nice atmosphere and decor.  Negatives: Price, dusty banquette.   Grades  Overall:  B-   (This would be a \"B+\" however, the dusty banquette merits                        a grade reduction)  Food:     B    - It was great food, but the prices were a little steep.                        The menu was also fairly limited.   Drinks:   A-    - Good selection of wine here mostly French / Italian,                         and pricing is good. Beware though, no cheap wine here.  Service  A-     - Our servers were social, and very nice. Formal table                           service akin to France. Plus points to our server for                          not recommending just the most expensive things on                           the menu."}
{"text":"I really loved my server Ashley and the lit Eiffel Tower in the center of the restaurant.   Now for the bad part. We ordered the spinach/frisee salad, duck confit with white bean cassoulet and steak with \"frites\"  Two drinks were ordered: a bloody mary and a french martini recommended by Ashley.  Both drinks were well prepared and strong.  The spinach/frisee salad was fresh with bacon dressing, a poached egg and lardons.  It was fresh but nothing to write home about.  The duck leg confit was ABYSMAL.  While my husband  was eating  I saw his unenthused expression, so decided to take a taste of it.  THE DUCK LEG HE WAS SERVED HAD TO HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND THEIR REFRIGATOR FOR A WHILE PRIOR TO BEING SERVED.  I cannot believe that Zinc Bistro would serve such an unappetizing, unflavorful , dry \"meat\".   When we got home, I asked my husband why he didn't tell the waitress how bad his food was and his answer was that he didn't want to spoil my birthday dinner.  I would have been kicking and screaming before I would eat anything so vile.  My steak and frites were NOTHING LIKE I AM USED TO IN PARIS!!!   The steak was cooked medium rare,  au poivre but the meat had no flavor whatsoever.  It also had an excessive amount of peppercorns.  A person who sat across from us returned his steak because of this.  I have eaten steak au poivre many times both in the US and abroad.  This is definitely an excessive use of  peppercorns. None of the restaurants I have experienced do it this way.  Doesn't mean that Zinc Bistro can't be unique.  But, it must be unique and edible.  The frites  were a total disappointment.  They could NOT HAVE BEEN FROM FRESH POTATOES---NO WAY, NO HOW . No WAY, NO HOW... HOW MANY TIMES CAN I SAY THIS?  In Parisian bistros the frites or fries are to die for---simply sprinkled with salt and they are amazing.  Zinc Bistro's fries had this or that sprinkled on them but this did not improve the lack of flavor from the potato.  OMG,  what can I say about a restaurant that  charges more than a Parisian  bistro but none of its flavor.   One saving grace was that they gave me a complementary mini-chocolate souflee as I was celebrating my birthday.   Zinc Bistro management.... check that duck confit dish.... go into the kitchen right now and taste it.   Get ready to spit it out.   I am feeling super-uber guilty that my husband ate that vile dish and kept quiet about it so he wouldn't spoil my birthday dinner.   Zinc Bistro,  how long can this quality of food continue before Scottsdale patrons realize that they are not eating anything like what is served in a Parisian Bistro.   I have to give Zinc Bistro one star--earned by Ashley and the complementary chocolate souffle."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've eaten at Zinc Bistro quite a few times.  It isn't somewhere I think to go often, but when I do, I really remember having great meals, so I'm not sure why I don't pop in more often.  Anyway, we decided on Zinc for Sunday brunch on Father's Day, and I was glad we did.  We all ordered drinks and I had a bellini.  It was quite tasty and refreshing.  For lunch, I ordered a salad and the rest of the party all opted for the steak frites.  Everyone really enjoyed the steak and frites, especially the sauce it came with.  The salad I had was their take on a caesar, and I really enjoyed it, especially the added touch of fresh dill.  The service and overall experience was awesome.  I would highly recommend this spot for a \"fancy\" special lunch/brunch and even dinner.  The patio seating outside is also nice, but not for the summer months!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I have family or friends in town and want to take them somewhere classy for a great price. And that serves amazing French food!  I love sitting in the garden off the back of the restaurant. So peaceful, it almost feels like you are no longer in a busy city.  The food, from the french onion soup to the Jidori chicken. God the Jidori chicken! I have dreams about that dish. So amazing!  The crab stuffed crepes are to die for. I could just go on and on!  Service is okay, probably the only reason I do not give it a five star. Everything about this place is on point!"}
{"text":"Service:  For a lunch hour it was the place to be!  However, we split to items on the menu and it took for EVER!  We ordered a salad to split and a hamburger.  We sat for a good 15 minutes between finishing our salad and the delivery of our hamburger.  And it was a bit frustrating when then table that sat down next to us was brought their meal way before ours came out! Quality of Food: My grandmother and I got the house salad to split and a hamburger.  The salad was brought out on separate plates; a bit smaller than I had thought...and definitely glad that I didn't get it just for lunch.  The hamburger was small!  Not cooked to our liking.  While they did take it back and \"re-cook\" the burger it seemed dry when it was brought out again.   Service: it was OK.  When we brought our problem to the manager's attention she blamed the kitchen and how their ordering system worked.  I really didn't buy it as I had worked in restaurants before.  To her credit, she did take care of the meal. Cleanliness: The restaurant seemed clean; it was the restrooms that were in need of attention!"}
{"text":"Love Zinc!  I get my Parisian fix here.  The French cuisine is top of the line, and the waiters are on their game.  The ambiance evokes a true bistro in Paris, complete with the bar in the front of the house.  The soups, salads, and entrees are all wonderfully prepared and presented.  I have had only the best at Zinc Bistro!"}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE ! This place was so dark! I couldn't read the menu! I asked both the waiter and the manager if we could turn up the lights and they just said no. They brought me a flashlight to read the menu!  Stupid and just plain silliness. The guy and his girlfriend had to get out their phones to read the menu.   We walked out.  **NOTICE** the trending details for this place has gone down dramatically over the past 4 months.  What does that say!!  Service sucks.  ** NOTICE** One of the reviews mentions that there was a COCKROACH just not once but TWICE in someone's salad. Health department needs to come out to this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!  Went here on a recommendation and couldn't have been more pleased.  I had the salmon and it was just wonderfully prepared and delicious.    The service very polite and knowledgeable.  I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I have a love affair with a sandwich. The basil chicken sandwich is the best thing that has ever entered my mouth. My taste buds do the jive when eating it. The fries with truffle oil are delicious. The Parisian atmosphere is authentic. The wine is plentiful. The \"secret garden\" patio is gorgeous. Go treat yourself, you derserve it!"}
{"text":"This place is as close to sitting on the street in a Paris bistro as you can get. Instead of Parisian snobs you get Scottsdale snobs, and instead of historic buildings you get teenage girls with victoria's secret shopping bags giggling as they walk past, but at any rate, you get the drift.   I was expecting the service to be more pretentious than it wound up being; the host, server, and bus boy were all really straight forward and made us feel quite welcome.   I only got to try the Zinc Burger which I must say is one of the best burgers I've ever had. Zinc Bistro proves that a burger is defined by the quality of the beef and not by all the extra sauces and spices. I think I remember trying the French Onion soup the first time I came here a few years ago and it was great as well, but it is excessively expensive in my opinion ($10) for a bowl.   Overall I think this is a great place to go especially if you have some time to enjoy the patio and sip a cocktail."}
{"text":"Awesome spot with impeccable service. Went in on a Wednesday during lunch.  Had the Crab Salad, Mussels and Pomme Frites, Truffle Parmesan Fries and finished with the soufflé.  Everything was brilliant.  Really recommend a patio spot especially during March / April."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and I love the place, great pates, mussels, and oysters.  Nice wines and wonderful service, when I am in town this is the place for me."}
{"text":"Dropped in late after a disappointing stop at another restaurant and we were pleasantly welcomed by Jesse the bartender and although it was late and the kitchen was closed he managed to get us a cheese and meat board .  He created a drink based on our tastes- nailed it and had a genuineness that is refreshing.  We were fortunate to have walked by and discovered this gem.  Can't wait to comeback."}
{"text":"The BEST omelet I've ever tasted.  Zinc Bistro's Gruyere omelet is not to be missed! Normally I order the steak or the onion soup, but I decided to try the omelet for a change of pace. It was so good ... I can't wait until I go back so I can order it again. It's THAT delicious!!!  For dessert, as always, I must order a chocolate soufflé. This time with chocolate mint sauce.  Zinc makes the best soufflés on the planet. Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Lovely!!! Great little French spot! i enjoyed all the appetizers and sat outside. great service. the"}
{"text":"Been here many times and food is always excellent. Prices have skyrocketed on some menu items. Example... Flat iron steak. Their web menu shows $28 but we were charged $34. That's a lot for flat iron steak, I don't care how good it is.  And what's with the Mexican music in a French Bistro? I enjoy Mexican music but not in a French Bistro. Service was excellent until our serve disappeared for a while (must have been break time). I have always given Zinc 5 stars but this experience was far from worthy of 5 stars. The only reason I gave 3 is the food was very good. Don't miss the chocolate soufflé."}
{"text":"Food and atmospheres is great. Unfortunately we had terrible service. So bad that we will never come back no matter how great the food is. Maria D was our server and had the worst attitude and hardly saw her. Everything took a while to get including water. It was all blamed on the kitchen even when she forget to put in our order."}
{"text":"Really Really Good!  Mussels were outstanding which are steamed in a really good sauce.  Crab Crepe was really good. Like a crab and cream cheese filling.  Oysters were fresh.  I had 3 kinds.  Blue Points, East coast. Fanny's and I forgot the 3rd.  I don't think an Onion Soup can get much better than theirs.  Perfect flavor in my opinion.  The house salad with the goat cheese crouton was good.  Dessert was really good.  Hard to choose between all the goodness.  We settled on the chocolate suffle (takes 30 min to cook) and the Binette with 3 dipping sauces.  Sooo good.  We sat in the garden.  Such a nice atmosphere.  We will be back! Only thing I would say is they need to update their prices online because half the items we got were a few bucks more than what they have stated online.  Kinda pricey but for how good it was It didn't bother me..  You get what you pay for.  Made reservations online which worked out great."}
{"text":"Words can't give justice to the filet with foie gras.  It's pure bliss.  Creme Brulee was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"This was one of our regular spots. But unfortunately during our last visit it was an absolute cluster. It took about 15 minutes for anybody to acknowledge us once we were seated, another five minutes to get water, approximately 30 minutes for entrées to came out. When my duck confit sandwich finally did come out, it was an absolute joke. The waiter agreed that the quantity of duck was absurdly small. Sent it back. Would have been a one star review but the manager was smart enough to comp our small check. Not sure if we will ever be back or bring friends here again."}
{"text":"I and 3 friends had dinner here on Saturday night. Service was wonderful and food was amazing! Love this place, keep up the good work. We will be back:)"}
{"text":"Food mediocre at best. Really... Scallops and coleslaw? Tasteless scallops to boot. Salmon over cooked. Mushroom ravioli in tomato soup.....not what I expected. Doubt the tomato sauce was homemade.   And don't even look at the website......hasn't been updated in over a year! Oh, and they ran out of the featured dinner for two at 6:30 on a Saturday night.....::poor experience. Will never go back. Big money with poor presentation.......too bad......"}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is my go-to restaurant to fulfill my after dinner / late night dessert cravings. Zinc Bistro makes from scratch an amazing Chocolate Souffle that comes with your choice of chocolate, mint or Gran Marnier sauce. If you decide to dine in make sure you place your order before dinner as it takes about 30 minutes to prepare. For dessert goers who have dined else ware, Zinc Bistro's souffle preparation time is perfect to make a little room while enjoying a glass of wine or coffee."}
{"text":"Had a nice Cab last night at Zinc. Love the atmosphere, great service and great food. Flat iron steak salad...awesome. Really great signature drinks as well. The seafood sampler platter...wonderful as well as their cheese boards. Truffle fries...wow...they have won awards with their fries!! Also, a great place to lunch....they have an atrium room with brick and fountains that is open to the outdoors from above...quaint...you feel like you are in a small french bistro. I have been frequenting this restaurant for the last 4 years...regularly for lunch and dinner...not once have I had poor service or a meal I had to send back to the kitchen. :)"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a quality French Bistro experience, look no further than zinc Bistro. This is my go-to place for french onion soup, a good sandwich or salad, and a craft cocktail. The patio is beautiful on a nice weather day, and the bar offers a unique French style experience."}
{"text":"If I lived closer to Zinc I would be a regular. Instead it is the spot me and my husband always end up going to for date night, anniversary's, and birthday's. Great atmostphere, amazing food. Sometimes it's a little bit of long drawn out meal, but I think thats part of the fun and it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times over the years. I'm such a creature of habit that I've usually only had the flat iron steak or the filet, and of course, the french fries.  But for our most recent visit I tried the Halibut. I had no idea what I was missing out on! Even the cauliflower was outstanding.  At the end of our meal I told our waitress that \"every single bite of everything I ate tonight was outstanding.\" And I meant it.  From the Organic Salad to the chocolate soufflé, outstanding."}
{"text":"I stopped in from the cold (yes a cold winter's night) for a beer and bowl of their famous French union soup. The soup is hardy and with the bread is a meal. The ambiance is upscale nyc bistro complete with tin ceiling, rich woods, and stainless steel bar top. It's pricy. A cup of soup was $12 and one beer was $10."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Wednesday evening at 5:30.  Just a few parties were there when I arrived.  Service was excellent.  Sat on the patio and enjoyed the quiet view.  Most parties chose to sit outside.  Muzack inside was a bit loud and seemed empty and lonely inside.  Food was very good.  Delicious spinach salad with bacon dressing and lots of pieces of bacon along with a perfectly soft poached egg.  Followed this with delicious, super fresh mussels  in white wine, cream, and herbs which were perfectly cooked.  The mussels were an appetizer size serving, but in combination with the other things I ordered, I had plenty to eat.  Finished off with the chocolate souffle with Grand Manier chocolate sauce and french press coffee.  The coffee was disappointingly weak (water to coffee grounds ratio was wrong).  The chocolate souffle and sauce needed to be a bit sweeter and richer and did not live up to the other reviews that I read.  Next time I would skip the souffle and coffee and try something different. Cost of dinner was $38 including tax, before tip. It was a very enjoyable evening and I would definitely go back. I agree with others who have said the prices are a little high.  I kept the price of my meal down by ordering 2 appetizers rather than ordering an appetizer and an entree. This saved $10-$15.  I also did not order anything to drink.  If you plan on ordering a 3 course meal with a glass of wine or a cocktail, you should plan on spending about $70-$80/person."}
{"text":"service, atmosphere, and food are all perfect.  this is one of my very favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  as a resident of LA, i don't often get a chance to dine at Zinc, but every time i'm visiting family in AZ, i make it a point to make my routine visit to Zinc.  make sure to try their duck confit sandwich, truffle parmesan fries, and chocolate souffle -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would probably only go to this place during restaurant week. Their regular menu is overpriced, and their wine selection by the glass is poor. They do have some good wine by the bottle, but if you're not interested in dropping $$$$ you may be disappointed. The patio is cute and the food really is authentically french, but it's mainly the wine selection that's disappointing.  Overall the place is good, but not 5 star good."}
{"text":"I like the foo-foo French cuisine every once in awhile, but Zinc is fabulous b/c its every day French and not overly priced for the quality and creativity.   Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Reminiscing about my dinner at Zinc Bistro makes me feel all melty, like slipping into a hot bath... Very decadent. I had the onion soup - it's remarkable how when onion soup is not loaded with salt it actually tastes oniony! Followed it up with the duck confit. I preferred the sliced duck rather than the crispy duck, but both were delicious, and the risotta was out of this world. Do I want the souffle? Yes please! We had the chocolate with Grand Marnier sauce, and the kitchen pre-divided it before baking so we each had our own perfect portion.  Two small complaints: 1. Despite having a reservation, our party was seated in the crappiest table in the house - the booth next to the kitchen door. We were promptly moved as soon as we requested it, but the worst table in the house should never be given to a (extremely polite) party with reservations. Save it for your rude, self-important, entitled Real Housewives of Maricopa County walk-ins. 2. The butter for the bread was rock hard. That's one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves, and it irritates me even more when it happens at a restaurant of this calibre. I need full and equal butter distribution on my bread. One giant hard chunk in the middle, or a wad of bread shredded by trying to spread icy butter, is a total buzzkill. It's the little things, guys."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one day and it was great.  Food was delicious...wine was good.  i suggest going here for nice lunch or dinner.  The service was also very good!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale for work and my coworkers chose since as our dinner option. The ambiance on the courtyard is beautiful, calm, and quiet. The food was delicious, our table ordered the muscles and pork belly apps which were a huge hit. Then I ordered the short ribs sand the sauce and a simple salad for my starter, the portions are relatively small, it is a French restaurant. The meat was cooked perfectly, I  was happy with my decision. The salad was literally a bed of lettuce with I asked for no crouton that was supposed to come on it. I expected them to have some variety of raw veggies when I asked for the simplest salad with the most veggies. When it came out it was literally a ramekin of dressing.. A small plate of lettuce..$10 for that! I would order that again. My coworker had the French onion soup and the other the spinach salad which they were happy with. The there's ordered the scallop, rock shrimp entree with chorizo risotto. They were very happy with their orders but once again surprised by the small serving size of 3 scallops and 3 spoons of risotto. We get so a custom to our very overly large servings of food that small or \"normal\" servings that are quality become a rare site. Overall, good food that was not a nice ambiance. Don't come here expecting large portions, or to get your fix of veggies and salad. The dishes are tasty and the staff are attentive."}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot for us in Scottsdale, both for an intimate dinner or a family meal (teens to my elderly mom.) I wouldn't bring small children here.  Service is excellent and the menu is dependably French. Love the cheese board and charcuterie: great way to start a meal with a crowd."}
{"text":"I was on my way to catch a Southwest flight out of Term 4 gate C-18 and noticed this place. I ordered a shaved grilled chicken with \"gem lettece\". It was iceberg lettuce with chicken, some shaved cheese for $16.50 + $3 for a quarter of an avacado.  It was iceberg lettuce which costs $2 a head. While the salad was delicious, I found it a bit overpriced for a salad with iceberg lettuce. I also had a cup of coffee for $3.29 which was weak and lacked flavor. Lunch was $29 including tip. No booze was ordered."}
{"text":"Good place with a great selection of champagne and decent menu.    Typical Snottsdale crowd (materialistic, ordinary and boorish BUT wearing a Rolex and driving a German car because it matters to them).    Fun place which reminds me of Paris dans le desert (except for ze peeple)."}
{"text":"Well, i cant really tell you how the food is because i didnt try anything. I walked in they sat me down in the patio like i asked got me a glass of water. I drank my water looked at the menu and the busboy brought me more water 15 mins later no one asked me if i wanted to order. No one even asked if i was ok! Waiters kept passing by i dont know maybe it was the way i was dressed in a baseball cap and under armour wear. Anyhow i just got up and left without saying anything. LoL"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my Scottish salmon and oysters; however, I felt really bad for my hubby. He had the ravioli, and it was not cooked long enough. My hubby was so hungry he ate it, which I felt bad. The ravioli was chewy. We came for our 5th wedding anniversary, and expected decent food. I'm appreciative for my food, but wish the money spent was well worth all the food."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in years! The ambience matched the relaxing atmosphere mixed with amazing customer service is what made it a 5 star experience for me. I will most definitely be returning and will let my friends and family know of my awesome experience here. I highly recommend the French press coffee and house made biscotti. Did I mention excellent service? My coffee was always warm and water glass always full. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Great vibe and attentive staff.  Two must haves... the macaroni & cheese and the short ribs.  I am not much of a meat eater but you could feed me the short ribs every day (with a side of mac of course).  The wine list is extensive and updated often and the staff knows which wines to suggest."}
{"text":"Charming and Delicious, French Onion Soup has great depth. Mussels, excellent. I would  have given 5 stars if the French Fries served with mussels had been like their side of French Fries vs a shredded pile of potatoes."}
{"text":"zinc bistro holds a special place in my heart.  i love patio seating as long as wafts of cigarette smoke isnt blown into my face as im enjoying my meal. the service can be a bit spotty here, but pretending youre on a parisian sidewalk makes up for it. ok maybe youre stuck in the scorching hot arizona desert, but zinc will bring you there for a couple hours. even for a drink or two or three, zinc is the perfect place to round up your pals and throw back some greygoose martinis in hot 115 degree weather.  choice dishes: duck confit sandwich side order of mac & cheese croque madame flatiron steak illy coffee  bonjour scottsdale-ites."}
{"text":"Best Mac & Cheese and Fries...WOW!  Nice quaint corner restaurant in the heart of Kierland!  Makes you feel like you're in Europe somewhere!  Staff is awesome, very friendly!!!  I believe they also part own the Mission, which I've been dying to try!!!???!!!"}
{"text":"I hosted a party of four at this terrific restaurant.  We enjoyed their garden room that really is the best in indoor/outdoor dining. Menu is still creative but also includes classic bistro fare like mussels and French onion soup. Service is top notch. The sole reason for four instead of five stars is that it is quite expensive. It is the perfect 'special occasion' restaurant."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a night out with good company. My first time at Zinc bistro was incredible. The partisan feel, the staff and the food were all remarkable. From the moment we walked in, I was in complete bliss. I tried the duck confit, and it was delightful. Cooked perfectly, poised on top of a bed of beans, sauces and deliciousness. I ended our stay with a cappacino which came with sugar cubes on the side as well as a biscotti. Give yourself a night out and come here."}
{"text":"It's very rare that we are able to go out to have a nice dinner with our busy schedule/strict diets so we decided to go to Zinc Bistro for the occasion.  We were seated in a strange corner booth that awkwardly faces another group of people.. Just the beginning of a terrible dining experience. The service was absolutely dreadful. Our server was very brief; she didn't bother to go over the menu with us nor did she even spend more than 30 seconds interacting with us. She brought us very warm, watered down \"hot brewed coffee\" that was some of the worst coffee I've ever had.  When I asked her what she would recommend for an entree, she gave me a stony look and responded very rudely. After she finished taking our order, they brought us cold/chewy bread that was hard to eat. When our entrees finally arrived, our server stopped by to ask if everything was okay, she turned to walk away while I was in the middle of answering.   Although the service was unpleasant, our food was quite the opposite: appealing! I ordered the Duck Confit and would go back to order it again. So many different flavors that balanced very well together. Tender/ juicy duck leg, delicious bean cassoulet and cherry tomatoes to cut through all of the heaviness of the dish. The foie gras sausage had no liver taste to it at all which I loved!   After dinner we were pretty stuffed but wanted to try dessert. Having a hard time deciding, we thought our server was coming by to help out but she came over to say \"are you going to order the soufflé because it takes 20 minutes to bake and we close in 20 mins\".  We decided against ordering more food and asked for the check.   Our server didn't come by to pick up our payment for a while. We weren't sure why she was being so friendly to the table a few feet away and being so cold to us. We are pleasant people and can be very generous when it comes to ordering and tipping. We would never act rude to people working in the service industry so it was just awful to have this experience.   Although we had a rollercoaster of experiences here, we would definitely come back to give them another try, the food is very good!  The hostess was friendly and the server assistants did a good job refilling waters and clearing our finished dishes. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Arrogant, a-hole bartender with a condescending attitude.  Not one compelling menu item.  Intelligencia sort of atmosphere, that was not appealing to me.  Very comfortable patio chairs...great view for watching people...but if you are craving dinner, walk 100 steps to another Kierland establishment. I will never darken their door again. Very French in their attitude....if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is \"American\" French food establishment. Translation, non pretentious french dining at a reasonable price. I have tried most everything on the menu over the years and have yet to be disappointed. The crab omelette and the steak frite are my two favorites. Their onion soup is wonderful and pretty darn big."}
{"text":"My boyfriend chose Zinc Bistro for a Friday date night spot for two reasons. 1: The quaint Kierland location and 2: The mussels appetizer. He was right about both.   The mussels were divine... Dipping the bread into the tangy juice followed by a glass of Merlot was just heavenly. If our meal ended there I would be back in a heartbeat.   I did not care for the dish I ordered. At first glance the crusted black sea bass sounded perfect but I soon remembered the reason why I avoid the daily specials. Shame on me. The bass was tasty but the mushrooms and endives did not pair well with the fish. Separately, these three would be a delight. But something was off and the flavors just did not blend.   The boyfriend was happy with his filet topped with a generous portion of foie gras. Two bites of his rich meal with the side of mac and cheese made up for my lackluster entree. If we try Zinc again I'll be sure to ask for recommendations."}
{"text":"What a nice, quiet, cozy spot to unwind after a long day. This place has so much character! I went late in the evening. They were out of their favored teas but the plain green tea was delicious! The bartender was very helpful in choosing alternatives. Outdoor and indoor seating available. I will go back and try some of their dishes."}
{"text":"We like this restaurant and return frequently when we are in Scottsdale as we did today. I had mussels and my wife had pate along with a side order of matchstick potatoes. We also shared a bottle of rose from Provence. Everything tasted great which was no surprise. Service was great, as usual.  During the meal I knocked over a glass of wine spilling it and breaking the glass. It was my fault. Not only was the manager very kind, she brought me a replacement for my spilled glass: unnecessary but a very nice gesture. There is something special about this place!"}
{"text":"Great French Bistro! We were told by locals to make this a definite must do for lunch on a recent trip to Scottsdale. Service with a smile is the mantra at this small crowded bistro. Close quarters make the atmosphere even more authentic. The décor and the menu are very much like several spots we have dined at in Paris. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch of mussels, salad and wonderful French rolls. Reasonable prices and friendly service made the hour spent at Zinc Bistro even better!  Can't wait to return for dinner on our next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We walked in with a baby in arms and was greeted with less than a happy face from the hostess   We asked for a table away from other diners. (The baby was  well behaved )  we sat out the front away from any other diner and promised to move the stroller if another patron needed the table next to us.    The food was very average  the curry pumpernickel sandwich was okay nothing to rave about. The mac and cheese was pretty good   The chocolate soufflé was good. Hint : order this when you are placing your food order and ask for whipped cream at that time also."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite restaurant in Arizona.  Been 3 times in the last year, not a bad thing to say about this place, not even close to a bad thing to say.  Food is unbelievable with a ton of options.  I love the a la carte seafood.  Great beer choices too - I don't drink wine but the wife raves about what she gets every time.  Quiet and great mood.  Servers are among the best I've ever had. It's not cheap but totally worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Zinc to celebrate my son's new job.  After having made reservations, I was a bit non-plussed at being seated one table away from the kitchen.  Aren't these the tables for late comers?  As is my usual practice on a first visit to any establishment, I just suck it up and wait to get on Yelp.   The servers were very good and friendly - a bit touchy - lots of shoulder taps - which was okay, I guess.   I really couldn't decide whether this bothered me or not.  For about ten minutes, we had the sun directly in our faces.  The servers suggested me move a little to be out of the sun and assured us that it would only be a few more minutes until the sun would be out of our eyes.  I guess they can't afford window coverings.  This is when I noticed the extremely dusty banquette - I even stood up and ran my finger through a healthy accumulation!  Good grief - I am sitting there, eating 32 bucks worth of scallops and staring at dust.  Geez.  Food was good.  It was expensive.  I felt okay about the prices, though I was not wowed to the point that I would make this a regular place.  If you look at Marie-Eve's review, they came in late, without reservations and were seated in the PATIO!!! Maybe we should have done that.  The wine list is pretty good, but no bargains there.  I might give it  a go for lunch some day, since my son's new office will be near there.    Anyway, to make myself all better after this not so great experience, we went to Delux Burger for dessert and nightcaps, otherwise, I would have pouted all night."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with a group of 10 ladies over the weekend and absolutely LOVED IT! I had been years ago and was quickly reminded that my visits here need to be more regular.   It's a fab spot for a lunch meeting or girl's outing. And at night I'm sure it's so romantic for a date night! They have 2 lovely patios and the food is amazing. I ordered their shaved chicken salad and oh my heavens, it's the best. We also split their truffle Parmesan fries because, you can't say no to those!   There were so many hearty salads on the menu that it was hard to choose what to order. I will absolutely be back with my hubby soon! My only complaint was that our waitress was not the friendliest but we didn't let her rain on our parade! We had a great time. Their French {literally} bread is also amazing!   See you again soon, Zinc!"}
{"text":"Just brought some friends from out of town (NY) and their only request was to sit outside to enjoy the weather before going back to the snow. Told the 1st host we had 7 people but forgot to mention \"outside\" but she had left to check out the table already so we followed up with the 2nd host (Asian girl) and asked if we could be sat outside and she said \"We'll see what we can do\". Ok. 1st host comes back and our table is ready and 2nd host (Asian girl) who we've been with the whole time walks us back to the table inside which prompts me to ask \"So I take it this means we can't get a table outside?\" To which she says \"No\". She didn't even try! We were with her the entire time!   I look out on the patio to find that there was indeed plenty of seating so I just asked the busser who was about to set down our drinks if we could sit outside and he took the initiative to go find if we could. Sure enough, it was no problem and 1st host made it happen (who was never informed of it in the first place).   So long story short, thank you to the busser and host #1 but Zinc Bistro, please tell Asian host lady that ignoring and blatantly lying about patron requests is no way to treat frequent diners.   All that said, after many times here, this was the first time we've ever experienced anything close to poor service. The rest of the meal with our friends was great. Don't let lazy Asian host lady ruin your rep.  I'm keeping a high rating because the food is great and the service is TYPICALLY good. It wouldn't be fair to let one lazy person ruin the overall experience."}
{"text":"Okay, so I love to eat at great spots with an amazing atmosphere.  But Zinc exceeded my expectations with all that and a reasonable price. I am definitely going back. The wines are great, the food (try the Salmon ) was beautifully prepared and the service was incredible.  Sherry j"}
{"text":"Great atmospere.....excellent food.......and awesome desserts. I always get the duck confit it is to die for......their french fries are great, they come with 2 different dipping sauces........you can sit indoors, out on the back lush patio or out front on the sidewalk...very French atmoshere......"}
{"text":"My parents and I had a last minute change of plans on Christmas Day so we drove around looking for a place to eat dinner.  Luckily, we came across Zinc and they had an available table for us.  With the very small exception of my oyster appetizer coming extremely late, the service was perfect.  My mom enjoyed her swordfish, while my father and I both ordered the tenderloin topped with fois gras.  My favorite part of the dinner was the wine, which was very reasonably priced.  I selected a 2005 Chateau Gloria which drank beautifully at its youthful age.  The crowd can get a bit loud, but then again, it's a bistro and this was Christmas.  I can't wait to go back, drink more wine and enjoy more wonderful food."}
{"text":"Over priced generic salad with a very little crab for $20 WTF very disappointed will never go back lunch for 2 was $60 and we left hungry"}
{"text":"love, love, love their basiled brie chicken sandwich and fries. the souffle is amazing. the mac and cheese is amazing. never been disappointed. only sad thing, not good for take out, the food gets soggy."}
{"text":"Good food, good steak, good fries. Really good French cuisine with an upscale flair. I loved the service and it felt like we were in Paris for the evening. Overall, I wouldn't say it was family friendly, but I think it would make a great date night."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the costumer service today. This party cut in front of us, and even after I had mentioned it to the hostess, she still proceeded to help them first. Where's the courtesy nowadays both professionally and personally, especially on Christmas? The excuse I was given by the manager?  \"It's stressful right now because the reservation system is down.\"  Needless to say we took our business elsewhere. No accountability here. #lumpofcoal"}
{"text":"The only reason I come to this place is the little patio, I love sitting on the patio while grabbing a bite with a friend.  I think the menu needs updating.  It feels a little dated.  Last time I had the chicken salad sandwich, because nothing else seemed appetizing.  My friend had the same.  Kierland is one of my favorite malls and this spot can offer some good people watching."}
{"text":"Best onion soup in PHOENIX. Actually it makes me think that I am back in Paris. Year in and year out this restaurant maintains it's quality and high level of service. A sidewalk table is quiet and somewhat romantic."}
{"text":"Ignore that 5 star rating I just gave Zinc Bistro.  You should avoid this place at all costs. That way I will never again have to wait for a table at my favorite French restaurant.   While your at it - stay away from the DMV too. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"Went back in August (for Birthday dinner).  After Mission I had huge expectations, and unfortunately not one was met.  Almost empty restaurant but service was terrible.  On multiple occasions had to seek out an employee for a basic request (silverware and water kind of thing).  Food was ok, but considering my expectations that ended up being disappointing.  Everyone has an off night so I'm hoping this was the case here, but I doubt I'll return to find out."}
{"text":"My father and I went to lunch on halloween here and ordered two hamburgers and on order of garlic fries. Starting off with the good, the fries were very good. Crispy on the outsides, soft on the inside, very good flavor. I will say for $12 the should be good. As for the burger, I would highly suggest to not order any burger here. Both of our burgers came out and I felt like it was the Wendy's commercial all over again...where's the beef? The beef patty was at least 1/3 smaller than the bun and that's being generous. I've eaten here in the past and it was wonderful. However, the burgers lacked taste and were not filling at all. In addition, when we asked for extra lemons and ketchup, the wait staff seemed to forget these. Maybe they were too excited about being dressed up for Halloween. Overall, great place for dinner, but I will never be back for lunch."}
{"text":"We went for Restaurant Week. Both the service and the food were fantastic. The lamb was so good I requested a momment of silence to enjoy it. Every dish was an explosion of flavors. The desserts were perfect comfort food. I came with friends but the outdoor garden would make for the perfect date atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Zinc last night for dinner. The decor and ambiance turned out better than I thought. I was expecting trendy sit-down restaurant place, but it ended up being more vintage and it had a pretty nice Bar area which was really popular on Saturday night. It was a bit noisy, but it didn't interfere with our dinner. I'd say it was about 50/50 split between people having full on dinner, and people just having some drinks with cheese and appetizers.  Now onto the food ... We ordered the onion soup, which must have been one of the best I've had. Not salty, the broth wasn't heavy, onions were cooked perfectly. I'd say this one is \"a must\" at this place. Main entries: 1) Seared Ahi was excellent - seared to perfection; 2) Pork Tenderloin was great as well. We just got their House White wine to go with the food. Generous pour of the wine was nice and lasted through the meal.  Overall: I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"I'll give two stars because my husband enjoyed his lunch.  I used to love Zinc and have eaten there many times for lunch and dinner.  After today I won't be going back. I had to send my lunch back.....how can they ruin a Gruyere omelet? It was barely warm and the cheese was hard.  The side salad was microscopic and the potatoes were insulting. It was a bad lunch and someone was asleep in the kitchen. Not acceptable.  The service was just OK. Not acceptable either."}
{"text":"My partner and I have dined in France so we really like what Zinc Bistro is doing for French cuisine here in Scottsdale Arizona.  The decor from floor to ceiling is spot on.  I love the inner patio.  When the weather is nice I like to see \"the ladies who lunch\" in their hats/bonnets.    On my last visit to Zinc I ordered a sandwich.  We were there for lunch so it was a sandwich that day.  Curry chicken salad to be exact.  Just the right amount of spice and curry.  I had a side of truffle Parmesan fries.  They were so good.  I couldn't stop eating them.  To drink, I ordered a Duvel.  Its a Belgian beer/ale.  It has a high alcohol percentage.  Boy does it ever.  One was enough.  Zinc Bistro is our French lunchtime getaway."}
{"text":"came here one night alone.  the hostess sat me down and kept staring at me as if there was a problem eating alone! i found that a little rude.  my waiter, however, was nice.  I only got the french onion soup and chocolate souffle for dessert since i heard good things about their soup.  it came out in this cute little cauldron, piping hot, cheese all gooey, and several crispy chucks of cheeses were tucked near the edges.  it was good french onion soup, although i have not tasted enough different french onion soup to judge it as one of the best.    the chocolate souffle took a while to make but it was quite delicious.  my server brought it out and poured this warm choc sauce infused with some sort of liquor.  the etoh didnt evaporate so there was still a strong taste to me, which i dont prefer.  the souffle itself was soft and fluffy which was good."}
{"text":"If I had to get lost in a corner spot, this is it. I have a thing for the French and Zinc Bistro makes my top 3 places here in Scottsdale. Whether it's lounging on the terrace with my girlfriends or determining the compatibility of flirtations, you'll find me happily sipping on wine and soaking up sunshine. Otherwise, plant yourself in the darken room or back terrace for mysterious adventure.  I don't think their menu items have escaped my insatiable appetite. My favorites are the beignets, pork belly, and truffle fries for starters. Trust me, you will perk up instantly with these. I never pass up the mussels because they know how to seduce me with the leeks, rosemary and garlic fries. I will almost loose my ladylike composure and pick up the hot pot to drink up the sauce. It's that frickin fantastic. My fave dinner item is the duck breast. Fatty goodness with black truffle. How does one go wrong with that?   Your wallet might cringe but then I guess that depends on how you value self investment. I'm all about the return and this place is a sure thing for me. Service is always attentive and friendly with top notch quality food. Bartenders are fun and lively so you are never short of conversation or company. Seriously, you instantly become a Parisian dining here."}
{"text":"Ok I will be short but what I have to say is not so sweet. I am astounded that this place is still in business.  We went this last Saturday night and were treated horribly. After an hour of waiting for our food and not having been acknowledged by our waitress. My husband & I got up to leave. (The people next to us had fininshed thier meal and they had been seated 20 minutes after us.) We asked to speak to the Mgr. He did not come, only sent the bill for our food ( that we never had recieved) and said that he would have it wrapped up for us to go. When we stated that we wereonly going to pay for what we had been served the Mgr (then suddenly appeared &)   said that he was going to call the sherrif. I think everyone has expereinced bad service but this place literally takes the cake."}
{"text":"Over the seven years since we've been coming to Zinc Bistro, we have never had anything less than a Five Star experience  Whether it's lunch, dinner, drinks, or just a quiet Valentine's Day night out, it's always been great.  Beef, seafood or chicken, it doesn't matter because everything is delicious.   Zinc is modeled after a Paris bistro. The prices are inline and appropriate, with such a wonderful fine dinning experience.  So sit back and enjoy, because you are in for a treat.  We made reservations for Valentines's Day for about five-thirty.  The bar area was packed and all the tables along the window were full.  There was a small line outside, but we were seated immediately.    Our server Frankie introduced himself and we knew the night would be special.  He was from North Bergen, NJ and to say he was character, would be an understatement.  He was warm and funny, occasionally touching shoulders while making a point.  He seemed to know instinctively what we wanted. We would come back just for him.  Amazing!   We started off with a glass of New Zealand Pinot and a glass of French...  and finished sharing a petite Chocolate Grand Marnier Soufflé and some decaf expresso. Wonderful meal, wonderful Valentine's Day night out.   Expect to pay $55 to $85 each, depending on how many courses you try or bottles/ glasses you drink.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This replica of a Parisian bistro serves up bistro classics such as the flatiron steak, cassoulet with duck confit, and delicious pommes frites. It's a great place to sit outside at the patio cafe.  Excellent wine list with many reasonably priced French wines."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Zinc Bistro! We went for my husband's birthday and had a wonderful evening. Absolutely no wait on a Friday night at 7 pm, which was a nice surprise, and even got seats in their beautiful hidden little courtyard. (Make sure you ask if there are tables available out there if you want a quieter, romantic evening as it can get rather loud inside when the place fills up)      For dinner my husband had the french onion soup to start,  which as always was the best you will find anywhere around, and the flat iron steak with zinc potatoes (their version of au gratin potatoes but with no cheese) He loved the steak, a perfect medium, and the potatoes were creamy and perfectly cooked. We do miss the cheese though!    I started with the tuna tartar, which is served with rye toast points and a cornichon paste, it was so good my husband, who refuses to eat raw fish, even tried a bite.... and liked it! Then I had the short ribs, which were melt in your mouth tender, as short ribs should be. My only issues was the amount of vegetables with the ribs... I think I literally had three slices each of carrots and celery... But they were delicious as well :)    We were then surprised with a little birthday treat for my husband which I will not ruin for anyone else who decides to celebrate their birthday here. I will just say that it was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.    Overall, I will have to say that Zinc Bistro is honestly one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley and I have never been disappointed in anything I have had there. Not to leave out that the service is always amazing and the staff is fun and friendly. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Great French bistro with elegant dining room, romantic enclosed patio, plus street side tables.  Wonderful ambiance and service.  Long nickle topped bar with large wine list.  Excellent French themed food with lots of creative dishes.  Oysters are terrific as is the French onion soup.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance and their fries, seriously they are that good!  My young daughter likes the tuna at lunch too and they have several other dishes that are great!  It was busy and they did accommodate a last minute reservation for dinner which was nice.    The salmon salad which is really not a salad, was just ok.  My husband and daughter liked the marbled rye bread that came with it.   Husband's steak was undercooked and had to send back, which we hate to do but can't eat it raw either.  Our waiter was ok and who said he only knows Italian not French ( I didn't ask just heard him tell this to others..) was busy running around but seemed perturbed when taking our order, that did it for me the entire night.   We wanted the chocolate soufflé but he didn't offer it as a dessert ahead of time but he did for the tables around us and we didn't get since it takes 20 minutes..  I think it was just an off day for them not sure just sharing what we went through.  It was the first time for my husband to come here and I was sad that he didn't like it other than the fries.."}
{"text":"We are dining here right now (7pm on Saturday August 23) .  Apps - my wife had the pate which was more of a terrine than a pate.  TAsted good but was dry and just ok.  I had the foi gras mousse which was also just ok and a bit watery.  The duck special included a duck sausage that had a southwestern flavor.  A bit odd in  a French bistro, the duck breast was cooked correctly but was a small portion.  I had the scallop which had 3 medium sized scallops that had a bit of an ammonia flavor usually indicating that it was not fresh.  And, at $36, that made each scallop $12. All in all a bit over priced and over rated.  This is a Scottsdale attempt at French bistro that comes up short."}
{"text":"Now this place has a great menu! Came for lunch and was very happy with the food. Sat at the bar and had a nice beer and sandwich. Food was seasoned well, prepared with care and tasted dang good. It's not somewhere most people will want to go for lunch every day. It'll probably cost you around 20 bucks and that's a bit much for most. I do think that their food is worth the money. Fries were great and so was my salad.   Bartender was nice and the place was full in the middle of the day with a pleasant afternoon crowd. It's a fun place."}
{"text":"I hate when a restaurant screws up an order, one of our guest asked for her grouper without sauce. She was kind but emphatic to the server...no sauce. Of course her meal came out covered in sauce. Now this causes a dilemma for everyone. Whether to eat their meal while it's hot or wait for the guest dish to be remade. No matter what happens it ruined the evening for everyone.    The food was outstanding and I would have given a five star review except for inexcusable mishap. They didn't even offer to comp her meal.  This was a major faux pas for the restaurant in how it was handled.  When you spend this kind of money for an entree you expect better service.  There are numerous places to dine in Scottsdale...won't be back."}
{"text":"Just got done with lunch and service was horrible. Julienne my server was very inattentive. She came around to check on things hardly at all. When I finished she took my credit card and ran it and then slapped the check down on my table with a \"here you go\" remark and off she went. If Julienne worked for me she would have been FIRED!"}
{"text":"Love this bistro because of the food.  It seems quite authentic, too - sort of like being in France except the service is faster than it would be in France.    My favorite item is the duck confit sandwich - it is not always on the menu.  You can also get a great glass of wine here.  I've eaten at the bar and that's a fun experience - you can talk to other customers and the bartender.  It's a friendly place with nice customers.  When I want to treat myself, I come here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner last night.  It was a Monday night at 8pm and the place was not too busy at all.  There were only 3 or 4 other parties in the place so we were seated quickly.  The decor of the place is actually pretty neat.  I got the \"France\" vibe even though I've never been there before.  It also goes without saying that I'm not super experienced in the ways of French cuisine.  While almost everything on the menu looks decent and pretty unique to my American eyes, but my wife and I decided to try something simple.  We split the flat iron steak.  It was very good and perfect to share.  We also shared the truffle and Parmesan fries and they were AWESOME.  I also had the iceberg salad to start and it was unique and delicious.  I would get it again.  I know, I know - I didn't go all out and order some hardcore French cuisine.  Next time I come I promise I will be more adventurous.  The service was friendly but a bit off.  Our waiter asked if my wife wanted more wine which she declined because she had 1/2 a glass left.  When her glass was finished, they took it away and didn't ask if she wanted another to accompany her entree (which she would have liked).  Also, a half hour went by after our salads until our entree came and there was no sign of our waiter who seemed to abandon us.  The place was almost dead by now so it was odd.  All-in-all it is an ok place and I would return.  I'm not sure if I'm going to rush back but I'm not crossing it off my list just yet."}
{"text":"Tried to make a reservation for three on New Years Eve & to inquire about the menu for the evening. She told me to \"call back later because I can't assist you with that right now.\" Haha really?! What a customer service disappointment in one of my favorite spots in North Scottsdale. Guess my wife and I will have to find ourselves a new favorite. R.I.P. Zinc."}
{"text":"Ok, I went here a while ago so i dont remember exactly what i got. But it was along the line of steak. It was delicious. Very crowded atmostphere and noisy. Service, eh it was ok. But food was amazing! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice, but otherwise not super impressed. We came on a Friday night at around 7pm and were seated immediately. Patio and courtyard were full.  Plenty of open tables on the inside. Service was extremely slow. It took about 20 minutes to order and then another 40 minutes before our food arrived.  My steak came out rare instead of medium, so I sent it back and waited some more... The steak was smothered in peppercorn which I thought was a bit much. It was a quality piece of meat, but seemed to lack flavor (other than the peppercorn). I will probably give them another shot, but not eager to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food at Zinc Bistro is absolutely fantastic! I went yesterday for the first time and had the curry chicken sandwich and bites of my family members meals. Everything was great.   The reason I'm giving Zinc Bistro three stars instead of five is  because the service was horrendous. After looking around, it seemed that it just might have been our waitress as the people around us didn't seem to be getting great service either.   Everything was fine until our food arrived. When it did, I asked for another glass of water and my sister asked for some french fries. Neither came until the end of our meal. We would have asked again, but our waitress didn't come see if we needed anything and it seemed nearly impossible to flag her down. When the fries and water finally came, the waitress put the rim of the pitcher right onto the middle of the glass where my mouth had been! She continued to do this for the rest of my family! This pitcher serves the entire restaurant, it was definitely unsanitary.   However, I again stress that it just seemed to be our particular waitress."}
{"text":"This place never gets old...I love everything about it.  You feel like you are walking into a genuine French bistro...amazing food, great location in Kierland Commons and great staff.  Our bartender this past visit was amazing...great personality and he hooked us with drinks."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, \"umami\", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! That's one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine."}
{"text":"ZINC is one of the most consistant places to eat in the valley. Zinc is the only place for a late lunch = bottle of wine and no time commitments! The entire menu is delicious and the decor makes you feel like your in a French bistro (especially once the wine kicks in). Weekend evenings are too crowded and busy. Go non-peak and savor the moments."}
{"text":"We came in for a drink and stayed due to the armosphire.. a great place!  Ended up with Mussel apps and was pleasantly surprised with the cilantro accent.  Drinks..service .. food A +  Make this a stop."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is a little piece of France right here in the desert. I am constantly missing my life I once had in Paris; it was such a growing period for me in so many ways. Culturally , learning diversity , to survive in a country not my own! THE FOOD! THE WINE!! But, I can't afford to travel back every month as I would like to! The one thing I've found in the valley, where I am always impressed with the food and drink scene is the lack of French eateries. There aren't that many! Recently on a Sunday afternoon , my husband and I popped into Zinc Bistro for a glass of something on the patio. It SO reminded me of cute bistros in Paris and really throughout Europe, where the people 'take' a relaxing drink or tea or cafe in the afternoon and bistros like this are everywhere! I always loved this way of life while living in Paris, cafe or a wine in the afternoon whilst sitting in a cute cafe people watching or getting in touch with a friend. This is that place! It may be in the rush of Keirland Commons.. but, use your imagination and you almost COULD be in Europe! We sat on this patio and enjoyed perusing the ample wine list that has an amazing assortment of French wines , from all over great regions of France. There are a few French and European beers too. Great French champagnes by the glass and by the bottle ... yes. Please. There are a few special wines from California too. We shared the Moules Marinière et Frites. It's under the hot starters , but we shared this and we were full! Especially when they kept replacing the lovely housemade crusty bread that is delectable for dipping into the garlicky broth!! There are many amazing starters and an amazing charcuterie and fromage starter on the menu too. If you only wanted to do what we did , which is enjoy the beauty of the fall weather and pretend for a little that we were back in France! This was a perfect afternoon for disconnecting from the world and technology, and just enjoying each other over wine , and not feeling rushed. NO one rushed us ! We even dined next to a famous retired NFL player , ( hint, he was a winner on DWTS!) .. so it must be good.. he seemed to know the wine list well! I can't wait to come back and try the Chateaubriand dinner pour deux.. $130 for 4 courses is not bad !! This was a great French find in the valley and voilà ... j'adore Zinc!!"}
{"text":"I agree with A.B:  Overly pretentious clientele Food does not deserve the high prices Snotty staff  I think the only redeeming factor for this place is the patio.  If you want French-inspired Bistro food head over to Coup des Tartes. If you want REAL French food, go to Vincent's. If you want to be insulted, overpay for your food, and regret your evening, go to Zinc."}
{"text":"I was watching food network and they featured Zinc for their French Onion Soup.  I happened to be shopping at Kierland Commons with my mom and grandma and putting two and two together I stumbled upon Zinc.      Zinc is an adorable little French bistro great for lunch or an intimate dinner. We ate in their courtyard and they had flowers, candles and all sorts of unique decorative pieces to observe.     The food is as good as the bistro is cute! I had a amazing salad and we shared the souffle for dessert!  Next time I am going to try the soup!"}
{"text":"we were in n scottsdale yesterday and decided to have lunch we ended up at the zinc  bar in kierland commons not our normal m o but were always up for an adventure zinc was not our first choice but it was a good choice we ended up having thecheese platter a choice of 3 or 5 cheeses out of 9/10 to pick from served w/bread  olives in a warm olive oil....    yum... a modest portion of sliced meat some walnuts/apple/grapes a nice noche for 14/24 dollars a bottle of wine and great service at the bar which is where we sat"}
{"text":"I went there wanting a snack around 5 pm. Their happy hour lasts until 6. I had an amazing seared Foie Gras appetizer. It went perfect with a Moscow Mule! If you're staying in the North Scottsdale area and don't want to trek down to Old Town, this outdoor mall is a great alternative, and you have to hit up Zinc!"}
{"text":"I have came to a realization why they decided to call this place Zinc Bistro, or at least I think. But boy oh boy, this restaurant is delicious. Dined for lunch with the Varzi salumi salad and butter leaf champagne with a glass of a refreshing red sangria. Salad was extremely tasty and the sangria was light and perfect for a sunny day. I contemplated giving 4 stars since our server was not the friendliest nor did the hostess allow us to sit where we wanted. But the food was so delectable, I have decided to wave that off (which never happens)! Great atmosphere and outdoor patio in the Kierland area.  Every time new dishes were brought out to the tables, my mouth watered, yum. I can't wait to try Zinc for dinner one night, it will be worth it! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. First night in town I walked around the area which in itself is worth seeing and found the Zinc Bistro. Being on eastern time I was ready to eat at 4:00 so stopped in for a meal. Limited lunch menu but still some great choices. I opted for the burger and it was very flavorful. Frank was my waiter and he was terrific. A group of us, 6 in total, went back two nights later, we had a lovely table outside all to ourselves. Perfect for conversation and the weather was delightful, it's been a while since this Michigander sat outside to eat. Again, another great waiter and everyone was thrilled with their meals. I had the halibut and it was prepared perfectly. One ordered a salad before his entree and it was huge, really a meal in itself, so advise it be shared unless you have a big appetite. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants and I always go when I'm in Scottsdale! I would give this 5 stars but am reluctantly giving it 4 stars because it seems the service has gotten a little spotty. It's not that the service is bad but you really notice when it's \"ON\". They've spoiled me on past visits so I may have unrealistic expectations. Seems unfair doesn't it? The food is consistently good. The crab and mushroom crepes are always a hit and the chocolate souffle is a treat! For entrees, I always order something new and have never been disappointed. Their specials are always good. It's great fun to sit outside and people watch while you're eating."}
{"text":"Waiter was very friendly upfront. After we placed the order we never saw our waiter again. This was at 5:30 pm on a Wednesday. The place wasn't even busy. After I received my order it was not what i ordered. I asked where our waiter was and they said he was busy. I have been to Zinc about 10 times and now we will never go back. The waiter never came to the table. The manager came to say sorry for the multiple mistakes but I asked where the asparagus we ordered was ... Multiple and multiple mistakes throughout the night. This is not the service you would expect when your sending over $200.00 for 2 people. I will never return."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the reviews on Yelp.  Here is what you really get.   A very small portion that hardly is enough for a child. Everything is ala cart.  Salad, is very expensive, Side dishes  very expensive, and entries are ridiculous. A small piece of chicken is 30 dollars,  a steak very small is 48 dollars. Service is OK, taste is good, but I would never go there again."}
{"text":"Really good burger and French onion soup. Nice cheese's too.  Good Parisian atmosphere and menu. All imported wines by the glass. Saddle up to the bar and hang out & people watch."}
{"text":"Great food and classy feel.  Walked in not knowing it would be a $200 meal for 2 but rolled with it.  Stands outs were the charcuterie and cheeses.  Good wine by the glass selection and a scallop dish that was seriously one of the best I have had in a very long time.  Good eats at elevated prices but with great quality.  Not bad for a Monday, but even better for a romantic Friday."}
{"text":"Good food most of the time. I have not had a bad meal there. It does not wow my socks of or anything but I would go back for sure. The owner is a bit of an idiot at times, drinking and hitting on girls in the bar is pretty inappropriate but I guess he can do what he wants."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a light dinner on a very hot day and ordered the cheese and meat platter with a glass of wine.  Everything was great!  There were so many cheese choices that I didn't know what to pick but the server was nice enough to help me choose."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is fantastic eatery serving French Cuisine. I always go here for their amazing onion soup. It's a definite must have if you are into soups. The melted Gruyere cheese on top makes this soup one of the best I've ever had. The ambience is classic French with a cute and quaint court yard tucked inside. Eating in the courtyard makes for a very romantic experience. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at Zinc. Wow. A treat for a special occasion or everyday high quality experience. Something special for everyone's taste. Today was no different. I highly recommend this restaurant indoor or outdoor dining."}
{"text":"another phenomenal dinner at Zinc Bistro. The Flat Iron steak special seemed like an excellent choice along with sharing some of the Fruit de Mer--specifically, Shrimp and oysters. Everything we ordered was excellent!  Great meal and very good service!"}
{"text":"This is more of a place for desperate housewives to be seen than a place to get authentic French food. That being said, the food on the menu is decent for what it is, and if you can ignore the caddy, dramatic women talking way too loudly as they scarf down their crab salads, it's not a half bad dining experience."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but we had a great New Year's meal. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing - authentic French food! You can choose to dine inside, dine outside for some Kierland people watching, or they have a private patio lit with lights and candles for a more romantic setting."}
{"text":"Although it is registered under the French restaurant category, the food is more American French. We ordered mussels for appetizer, which is cooked with white wine, herbs, and lemon. For entree, we ordered duck with risotto and halibut with corn bread. The duck is tendered and the halibut is fresh. The food is decent, but it's not special.   The restaurant has a lot of sitting areas (outside along the street side walk, garden seating, and indoor seating). The staffs are friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"We tried Zinc Bistro for the Restaurant Week Menu.  We both started with the Vichyssoise (Classic cold potato leek soup) The Zinc Bistro's version of this soup was kicked up a BUNCH with these tasty Salmon Croquettes topped with PASTRAMI CURED SALMON topped with radish and lemon pickled onion. The creamy soup was laced with what I think was leek oil and what I think was Esplette and was great alone but with the addition of the adorned Croquettes it became amazing and really was one of the best things I had anywhere this year. This soup was OUTSTANDING and should be on the summer menu as it was PERFECTION for a summer meal.    I sure didn't mind ordering Scottish Salmon for dinner as it was meticulously well crafted with many little details. They took the time to roast a baby fennel till it turned caramelized. They Pickled a pretty red Endive and turned it into something interesting and pretty. The nicely crusted and seasoned Salmon sorted of popped a little with the addition of sweet and tangy Kumquats. This all at on a pillow of creamy rich puree studded with Beluga Lentils that pop in your mouth like caviar.   The Confit Lamb Shank was just as wonderful being melt in your mouth perfect and was a gastronomic journey of Moroccan Style Seasonings with interesting crafted vegetables.  The Hazelnut Toffee Chocolate Torte was good and rich! The creamy Ice cream seemed to lighten it up a bit and the Burnt Orange Honey Carmel complimented it very well.  The Show Stopper Dessert was the Canelles De Bordeaux with Vanilla Brandied Cherries, Espresso & Valhrona Mousse. The little Cake Towers were delicious and had a texture like no other. They were firm and almost caramelized and the inside sort of melted in your mouth and had a rich pastry cream taste and soaked up the light very chocolate Mousse and Cherries. It was maybe the best dessert I had this year!  Service was friendly and efficient.   This was a Great Dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner last night and really enjoyed our evening.  We started with the Ahi Steak Tartare.  I would come back for that dish alone!  I normally order the tartare where ever I go, but this has been my favorite!  As my entree I had the scallops and risotto and my husband the filet.  A little pricey, but good.  We ate indoor, but will probably try the garden next time. My husband ordered the french press coffee...just fyi...the open small white cup with the small spoon is not sugar, but salt! I ruined his coffee.  LOL"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years.  Love the outdoor patio and the garden."}
{"text":"Service here sucks. I love the food still.  But the service is so bad, I never want to come back. Honestly.  Sorry Zinc, ya'll need to get new servers or some shit.  AWFUL service. AWFUL management."}
{"text":"Bummed, the only thing that was truly amazing was the foi"}
{"text":"The food itself is ok. The dessert is to die for and the atmosphere is awesome. A favorite place to have.dessert and wine at the end of the night"}
{"text":"I had a party of approximately 15 people out in the garden area. Honestly probably a nightmare table to take care of because my friends tend to be high maintenance but our server handled everything well! The menu was difficult to read so I recommend looking at images on Yelp first!! In the end everything was delicious and the ambience was amazing.. my only complaint is that one of their staff members was harassing us. When we sat down he was going on saying how he just turned 18 and honestly stayed way up in our personal space throughout the experience making some of my friends uncomfortable"}
{"text":"This place is great! Went for a lunch date with my fiancé. Between the two of us we had the French onion soup, Dungeness crab crepe, Jidori Chicken, hangar steak, soufflé, and the creme brûlée. Everything was amazing. My fiancé was not fond of the soup, he says it had a sweetish aftertaste. I enjoyed it though! The crepe was straight from heaven. And the creme brûlée? No words. It was all so amazing. We had a good lunch experience. Didn't feel rushed and the food didn't take long to make it to the table. Our server even made sure to let us know that if we wanted soufflé, to order it early as it takes a while to make.   The only reason for 4 stars is because the hostess at the time didn't seem to really know what she was doing. She may have been new though, so I won't be too harsh.   This was only our first visit so I will update when we go again - because we will!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to spend Christmas Eve here...we've walked from our home and had cocktails before and just love the atmosphere, so it was an easy pick for this special meal.  While the decor and atmosphere set this apart from many restaurants once again, the meal my fiancee got and the illness after made this a less than great experience and we won't be risking a return visit.  Most of the meal was fine, although when she received her entree of short ribs it was cold.  She sent it back and received what seemed to be a slightly warmer entree, but we both deemed it warm enough to eat since I already had my steak in front of me and the issue set the flow of our meal back.  The server was nice enough to remove the entree from the bill, but my fiancee spent the next two days (including Christmas Day) in bed dealing with food poisoning.  We had the exact same food and beverages, except for the short ribs...and she was unable to celebrate Christmas or enjoy our Christmas meal.  There is no contact email on the Zinc Bistro site or we would reach out directly.  Hopefully this helps prevent such a situation in the future for other folks, and I do hope they reach out to us directly."}
{"text":"Given the positive yelp reviews we were anticipating a night of fine French dining; however, that was not the case.  While the food was good the service was not. It being the Saturday night before Easter it's understandable the restaurant is busy and service can be slow. Once our party had all arrived we were promptly seated and our drinks were quickly brought. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. We were seated in a booth table in the bar. The bar had about 6-8 other patrons. The music was loud and being seated near a speaker it was difficult for our 88 year old father to hear. We asked for it to be turned down a little. Our waitress informed us it couldn't because it was in the bar area. We asked again and the manager said because our table was the only one that could accommodate a party of six we would need to stay in the bar area and the music couldn't be turned down. One look around the restaurant and we saw multiple tables that could have been pushed together to accommodate us.  Once the bar emptied out a bit someone lowered the music only to have it turned up again a minute later. It was really weird.  It took a long time to get our food, over a half hour. My husband and daughter ordered the $130 meal for two. They had a choice of sauces for the chateubriand and ordered the red wine sauce and it came with béarnaise. A little thing but for the price that is something that should be checked by the server before the meal goes out of the kitchen. My cassoulet wasn't hot and missing the foi gras sausage.  At least once I told the manager it was promptly brought out.  While the manager checked in with us our server was nowhere to be seen. In the end they did comp us with two desserts which was a nice gesture. Nonetheless, it wasn't the evening we were hoping for - a disappointment."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and everything on the menu is super good.  The service has always been great.  I recently tried the crab salad with some hesitation but was pleasantly surprised.   This place is much better for lunch than it is for dinner.  There's a funny sort of crowd that comes here for dinner, plus I think the lunch menu is better than the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I took my daughter this past week-end for lunch.  While being seated, I mentioned to the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday.   Once seated,  we ordered the french onion soup to start.  Delicious! Lunch for us was the gruyere burger and the pastrimi sandwich. Both were made to perfection.  The best part of the lunch, however, was the surprise chocolate soufle with syrup.  Not only were we pleasantly surprised (we did not tell the waitress we were celebrating a birthday, just the hostess).  Also, that same hostess came over to our table during our meal to check on us.  From the lovely lady who cleared our dishes, to our waitress, to the excellent hostess, we enjoyed a memorable lunch and we left with a very strong desire to return."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Zinc for the first time recently right as they were opening.  Considering they were not yet busy, we had pretty mediocre service.  To begin with, we were not offered bread.  Since it was our first visit, I wouldn't have necessarily assumed we would get bread, but I noticed other tables had it, so naturally I felt slighted.  And then the cardinal sin of serving.  I was maybe 25% through my meal, when our server appeared with our check and asked if we would like dessert.  Well, I don't know.  I haven't really eaten yet.  My husband wasn't even finished, and he eats like he's still in the military.  Needless to say, I just took the check and short-changed her tip in return for short-changing the time I was apparently allotted for eating.   As for the food.  I had the macaroni au gratin with smoked ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffle fries.  I liked the mac and cheese.  Not the best I've had, but pretty good.  The fries were okay.  But I've never understood the concept of dressing up plain 'ole french fries and serving them with ketchup.  If I'm not going to get a nice aioli or some other special dipping sauce, I'd rather just have the fries sans all the other crap.  I wouldn't necessarily object to a return visit if I'm in the area, but I won't be breaking down their door.  Just as well, I doubt they would care."}
{"text":"If you love mussels, you have to try their featured appetizer in a wine sauce. So incredibly delicious. My husband is an oyster fan and he says they are some of the best. Great wine selection, ambiance and the servers are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant with my daughter because we were shopping and happened to walk by.   It is very nice on the patio, lots of people watching, but it can be a little loud at times from the occasional car driving through the intersection. People like to bring their dogs on the patio but seem to keep them on the sidewalk so it didn't bother us. They have a fancy indoor dining room, probably popular for dinner. They also have a heated courtyard with small trees and birds.  The service was a little slow but was friendly. The food was pretty standard. I had the curry sandwich which was more like an Americanized chicken curry and it was good. The only real \"kid\" option was maccarroni and cheese which my child ate, but it was more of a tart/bitter pasta for adults."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at Zinc Bistro, and it has wonderful outdoor seating (unfortunately it was all taken).  French Onion Soup ($10):  I'm a sucker for FOS, and it's pretty much a guarantee I'll order it if it's on the menu.  For $10, I had high expectations, but sadly they were not met.  There was just a little too much vermouth for my liking.  Crispy Duck Confit sandwich ($12):  Now this was a winner.  Crispy duck, garlic aioli, and onions...YUM!  Picture:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2lP2q37FzGh__FEb-vrlig&userid=WMLaiOmjm-Y8EUWZ_edJlA  Our waiter talked us into getting this \"amazing\" fries and went on for a couple minutes about how they make them and what not.  I thought they were average at best. *shrugs*"}
{"text":"I felt like I should have been in France. It is beautifully decorated. I came here for brunch and had a french press coffee with (whatever they call it in France)... basically a fancy scrambled eggs with salmon and toasted baguettes. It was amazing! I also tried the pesto chicken and it did not disappoint. I will be here again..."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!!! Frankie our server was the best! Foie gras is superb! We will definitely be back again. We tasted all of the desserts and we were surprised at how great it was.   Their breakfast is my favorite! The creme brûlée French toast was my fav! It didn't need anything!   When you go, ask to be seated with the best waiter there, FRANKIE!"}
{"text":"Overall: 2.0 Ambiance: 4.5 Food Quality: 4.0 Food Quantity: 3.5 Value: 2.5  Conclusion - I may try again but this experience was such a let down I might spend my $ elsewhere instead.  What I tried:  Scallops -  2.0, NOT recommended! Cooked properly but the chorizo way 300% too overpowering on a dish that had all very light flavors. The executive chef should know better!!! I expected a 'hint' of chorizo, not half a sausage diced up and covering the risotto. Might have been a decent dish otherwise but who would know.   Cheese Plate - 3.5, recommended Nice cheeses and noshing items - grapes, olives, garlic, etc. Would have scored higher but they need to increase the additional items (especially olives/garlic) a lot as there was not enough to go around for the 6 of us on the largest plate they offer.   French Onion Soup - 2.5, so-so I've had much better. Maybe it was an off day or it was leftovers but it was bland and tasted like it was a few days old. I have had French Onion Soups from at least a hundred different establishments... It was not bad, but I'd not get again here.  Braised Lamb Shank - 4.0, excellent This was what I was was expecting from all the food. Well done in every way.  Poppy Seed & strawberry souffle - 1.0, no flavor at all very disappointing. I love poppy seed muffins and would have taken a muffin over this flavorless mash any day. The strawberry filling was lacking much flavor itself but what it did have 100% overpowered the nearly non-existent poppy seed flavor."}
{"text":"Pass this one by. Not worth it.$14 for French Onion Soup! Sean, the bartender, only pays attention to people he knows, don't expect much service at the bar. $10 for a small draft. Guess their rent is high, so they have to over price everything!"}
{"text":"Average food on a very limited menu.  Service was barely adequate, and the prices were very over-priced.  Location is convenient, but parking can be an issue.  Seems to be very popular with the trendy high school crowd [something I shied away from even when I was in high school]..."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westin Kierland next door and came to the Commons to get our grub on.    We decided to go with Zinc Bistro because we saw some beignets on their menu!  What we ordered:  - Grilled Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich  - Dungeness Crab Salad - Crab, lime, pickle, iceberg lettuce, tomato - Basil Grilled Chicken, Arugula, Mushroom Sandwich - Truffle Fries - Beignets  Food:  Everything we ordered was delicious.  Our one comment is that the basil chicken mushroom sandwich... had one or two mushrooms.  We were a little disappointed.  The beignet weren't really beignets.  They were like mini donuts.  Still good.  We were just expecting something a little different.   Service:  Very nice.  Water service was good as well.   Ambience:  Casual.  Outdoor seating is the way to go if it is nice and sunny outside.   Overall:  Great lunch spot.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a good sandwich at a decent price."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  service was great.  food was just ok.  ordered oysters, tuna ahi, filet, and rib eye for two.  the rib eye came out already cut up.  didn't like this as I like to cut into my own steak!  a little bit too much salt on everything for our taste."}
{"text":"Lunch on the patio  78 degrees outside. Thought I was in French bistro. Food delightful and service spot on."}
{"text":"Très chic. Wonderful Food. Candle light mood. Over 30 and foodie person!! Hit it, you'll love it"}
{"text":"The pork belly was phenomenal, in addition to the filet with foie gras.  The pork belly was actually the best I have ever had.  I will be returning to order both of these items again."}
{"text":"This is another over rated place. Good mussels and really good Farro salad.Now let's get to the misses. The$35 steak is of mediocre quality. The Short Ribs are fatty.Lastly the Ahi Tartare misses the mark. Good bread though. Not worth going."}
{"text":"Oh My Freaking God i love this place...i have never had a bad meal here before and have great certainty that i probably never will. For starters, i have always had EXCELLENT service and warmth from the servers, secondly my food is always prepared wonderfully and finally, the ambiance is perfect for lunch or dinner and being able to have good table conversation. I ate there again just yesterday with some friends and had almost forgotten my love for this restaurant.  Their Macaroni and Cheese, truffle fries, duck sandwich, zinc burger....uuugh, i could go on about everything on the menu but whoever is reading this I'm sure would be very annoyed and overwhelmed so i will just describe my meal yesterday... We all started with the macaroni and cheese for the table with some truffle french fries...(without trying to be over the top I'm going to go ahead and say they are the best fries EVER).  for my Entrée i had the scallops with rock shrimp, carrots, corn, peas and potatoes in a light corn cream sauce...i was in heaven (please note that i was told that particular presentation of the scallops is seasonal so if it sounds good to you, go get it before the end of summer).  I would have loved to have enjoyed some dessert, but i was so full i enjoyed a simple espresso instead.  My friends and I all shared bites of everything (the duck sandwich and smoked tuna appetizer) and we all Mmmm'd and Aaahhh'd at the flavors in our mouths.  If i haven't conveyed my love for the food at this restaurant, please, go visit it for yourself.  I hope you become as much of a fan as i am. Cheers!"}
{"text":"When you are looking for a Parisien flavor both in the food as well as the ambiance, Zinc should be on your short list.  My last experience was a positive one but that was almost 2 years ago. My son and I dined here a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed our evening.  The menu is comprised of a very good collection of French favorites ranging from croque Monsieur and croque Madame to chateaubriand for two.  We opted for the chateaubriand which is offered as a 4 course prix fixe.  The meat was excellent. Prior to the entree we were served French Onion soup which was delicious.  We chose the chocolate meringue as our dessert. This was the weak link in this set menu. There was nothing meringuey about it. More of a molten chocolate filled cup cake in a small bowl.  Service was quite good. Frankie, our server, was friendly and knowledgeable.  Be prepared to pay Champs Elysee prices.    Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"Why do birds suddenly appear?  Every time you are near (in the garden room cause their waiting for you to feed them) Just like me they long to be close to you (especially when you start feeding them bits of fries)  This place is amazing especially the garden room.  I wish I had a better camera phone, but just one small shot of the place doesn't do it justice.  The Food is awesome - had me a Duck Confit sandwich and a side of fries.  Yum yum yum all the way (didn't feel right feeding the birdes duck so I didn't -- it's your cousin man!)  Service was top and on the ball.  They were there when I needed them and they were gone when they needed to be gone :) Zinc Bistro thumbs up! - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Just got back from a lunch with a girlfriend, neither one of us had been to Zinc before but I chose it and now it's our new favorite lunch restaurant.  Go for the food.  Go for the multiple atmospheres to choose from; patio, indoor or garden cafe. Go for the drinks. Go for the food. Go for the service.  Go for the frites.  We had chicken sandwiches and every bite was the best. The chicken itself tasted fabulous.  This is the perfect place if you are eating alone or with a small group. Can't wait to return for dinner and cocktails soon."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I didn't realize until yesterday when I was uploading pictures.  Ever since I had my oysters here six or seven years ago, I fell in love with this place and dine here several times a year.  First thing I always order is a bottle of pink lemonade. Lorina Sparkling Pink Lemonade is well made sparkling drink nicely complement my meals whatever i might have that day.  I like their oysters, and other seafood appetizers. Everything I had has been very good.  I also like to order cheese trays.  They normally have about 10 different cheeses to choose from and I like to try different cheese, and eat with olives, nuts, apples, and some bread.  For main course, I tried everything on the menu... Omelette is always good, they do cook with my favorite gruyere, of course it has to be good. Another my favorite is risotto. When I can't think of anything else, I order this risotto.  Sauce they serve is very tasty.  They rotate some menu from time to time and yesterday, I tried their salmon, and was very pleased with my choice.  For desert, if you want to order their signature chocolate souffle, order 15 mins before you finish your meal as it takes time for them to cook.  Whatever you order from the desert menu, don't forget to order French press coffee. It sure complements the sweets.  Service and ambiance is always good. I like they way they decorate the inside with many books. Server and other staff are very attentive and they know how to take care of the guests.  Always happy after my visit here."}
{"text":"Ahhh... Zinc.  It's been a while since I have left Paris.  Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.  Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.  The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.    The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.  On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.  So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as \"picky customers\".    One more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff.  Don't miss:  Dining in the courtyard, or the sidewalk. Skip: Specials that are simply trendy"}
{"text":"I've been here a million times and usually have lunch at the bar.  This is the classic french brasserie style restaurant.  With a nod to Balthazar restaurant in NY's Soho this is a fun place.  This visit I sat at the bar and had the curry chicken sandwich on toasted sourdough.  I think that toasting the bread on any sandwich makes it better.  The sweet curry flavor make this sandwich a winner.  Sean may be the best bartender in Scottsdale.  He is always friendly and very efficient.  Definitely stop in here the next time you're at Kierland Commons."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere.  Had the squab and foie gras for an appetizer and the braised lamb shank for my entree.  My significant other had the scallops over risotto. The wine selection is great and all of the food was to die for.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and was great at making recommendations.  I would absolutely come back here again."}
{"text":"Yummy for my tummy. I was here for  a special lunch with my coworkers and let me tell you this place was PACKED! I was happy I made reservations because it was was butt cheek to butt cheek packed. I order the Crispy Duck Confit Sandwich that was so good, if I was at home I would have licked the plate. The regular house fries were delicious to the point that we were almost fighting over the last one. Sad but true. The chocolate souffle was just ok considering that they talked it up to be something great. I was expecting amazing but it was just ok. I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner real soon. I have got to try that French Onion soup because it looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"Pro- Amazing soup!  Also good vibe in the restaurant.  There is nothing worse than screaming Scottsdale uncontrolled children, which there was not!  Con- Some of the dishes were overpriced & I could have made them at home."}
{"text":"On Saturday, a friend and I hosted a surprise baby shower in the Garden Room... which we made the reservation around the end of February. We first tried Arcadia Farms, (awful response and not helpful), then went to the Farms at South Mountain, (Ok if want to sit at picnic tables outside with a buffet of sandwiches), and then we had the idea to try Zinc Bistro. The moment we walked in to discuss our plans they were extremely helpful and we knew we found the right place and it would be fabulous.   The staff was exceptional, we wanted for nothing during our event; the food selection they help select for the event was fantastic and accommodated everyone's taste. Since we had a large party, they even choose not to seat anyone else in the room to give us some privacy... their choice, not ours. To accommodate us, they made suggestions to make the event even more personal by setting up a cheese table and later changed it out for our cupcakes instead of taking up more room on our tables. It was the little things that made the event so special and we never felt rushed to leave so they could seat other guests.   At the end of the event everyone commented how lovely it was, what a perfect setting, and how impressed they were with Zinc Bistro's staff, and the delicious food.   As for previous comments on price, I found this very reasonable for the quality and selection. It would have cost us more at the Farms in South Mountain for a stack of sandwiches, and Arcadia Farms starting price was absurd. I highly recommend contacting Zinc Bistro for your next intimate lunch or dinner, or large event. I wouldn't hesitate to come back again and again...   Thank you Zinc Bistro for everything, it was perfect!! Special thanks to Cat Frankel, who helped coordinate, and Frankie our server, who everyone fell in love with."}
{"text":"I check in with open table and like that I can leave a message. I checked Anniversary because we are celebrating many years of marriage. No one noticed or bothered to acknowledge.  Water was dumped right away and ran. I do Not take ice and favor a lemon slice so when our waitress appeared I politely asked for a new glass. She did take the water with ice away but failed to return any water to me.  The place is charming looking however the thumping of a beat was awful and annoying that alone will keep me away. I asked the busboy to turn it down but that failed, it got louder.   I ordered the onion soup gratinee, for $14 one gets a cup but since it wasn't that good I'd rather not have more. There were way too much onions, not enough cheese. It is Not the best I've had.   My hub liked his duck confit sandwich which I didn't taste because I wanted to leave.   I smiled at the two hostesses as I left and neither said thank you or good bye, well adieu I won't return here."}
{"text":"You gotta give credit to those who deserves it and Zinc Bistro definitely deserves all the 5 stars. If I could, I would even rate them higher.  My AZ restaurant week adventure took me and my wife to our second upscale restaurant in 3 days. Our taste buds took us to Zinc Bistro on a rainy Saturday night.  From the outside, the bistro looked very ordinary. A simple restaurant sign, glass and wooden door, and some patio seating for the romantics. Nothing intimidating and nothing too fancy.  Inside the bistro, it was different. You are immediately transported from AZ to NY. The place turns from ordinary to exciting. The vibe becomes alive. Unlike other upscale restaurants, this one is upscale but not a stuck-up. In fact, this one is quite inviting. I felt like I can laugh around my friends while enjoying my wine and enjoy some stories while not rushing my meals.  Ambience... CHECK!  We were greeted at the door, then the receptionist led us to our corner table. The usual. Nothing extra ordinary. Soon as we settled at our table and our server (Dylan) greeted us and gave us the menu, from there on, the service was quick, efficient and VERY attentive. I can't even remember when and who filled our glasses with water. I usually measure service by how attentive the staff is, if your glass of water is always full and ice cold, that means someone is always looking after your table. At Zinc, my glass was never empty. For me, that says a lot about their service. Our server (Dylan) was also at the top of his game. He made sure we our enjoying our food and also made sure we enjoy our experience by offering the best that they have. You always feel comfortable when servers approach your table with a smile. Service was simply EXCEPTIONAL...  Service... CHECK!  Ever had a meal that made you nod your head every time you take a bite? As if telling yourself that you made the right choice and you did a good job choosing the right meal. That's Zinc bistro food for you. You know you made right choice on every bite. We ordered the Smoked Duck Terrine and Pastrami Cured Salmon Burrata. The smoke duck terrine filled my mouth with all the texture you would look for. It had both a crunch and velvety bite from the terrine and pistachio. Also gave the salty flavor from the duck while balancing it out with the apricot and vinaigrette. You also get the freshness from the carrot and arugula as you mix all the component in one bite. The pastrami cured salmon on a burrata did not fall short as well. There perfect balance of texture with the burrata and salmon while you get the freshness from the roast beet and butter leaf salad. The appetizers alone made me nod on every bite. The main course was just CRAZY GOOD! The flat iron steak was perfectly cooked. The crust from the outside complimented the tender and juicy medium rare center. Make sure though that every slice you take has some caramelized shallot or else it might be too salty for your taste. The caramelized shallots balances the flavor to the sweet, salty and partly tangy perfect bite. My wife had the confit lamb shank. The lamb was so tender and the meat falls off the bone easily. It was perfectly complimented by the Beluga lentils, medjool dates, roasted turnips and crushed almonds. Again, the texture and flavor was well balanced. We also loved the slight touch of the crema fresca that cut through the gaminess of the lamb. If you hate lamb, this meal might just change your mind.  Lastly, the dessert. I alway want my dessert to be sweet but not overly sweet. I want it to make me feel like it satisfied my sweet tooth without making me like I ate a whole box of cake. We had the brown butter cookie w/ peanut butter nougat and salted caramel. It was a very sexy Snickers bar on a plate. When eaten w/ small bites of mint leaves, it takes the sexy snickers over the top. We also had the grilled pineapple tarte tatin w/ toasted tahini and cardamon ice cream. The cardamon ice cream cuts through the tanginess of the pineapple. Since the pineapple was grilled, the natural sweetness of the pineapple comes out. Oh and the chocolate soufflé ( their top dessert ) is a must have. How was it? It was so good that only tasting it on your own can explain the experience.  Food... CHECK!  Overall, it was a perfect experience. Which is worth the money you are shelling out. The food was awesome. The service was exceptional. The place was alive and inviting. Truly deserving of a 5 star.  more reviews at  http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Got the touted burger.  It was good but a little over cooked at MW.  Definitely order the medium.  Truffle fries were good.  I'm a sucker for truffle fries.  They were a little salty.  End o the day I will be back looking at the coq au vin and onion soup staples... Unless they decide to add a braised rabbit to the menu!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, even though I don't get over here as often as I'd like.   First of all, the interior is stunning. I love coming here when the weather is nice enough that the opened windows let in fresh air and crisp white light that fills the place. I've never been for dinner but that will have to be next.  The first thing I ever tasted here had me trying to recreate its magic at home - a basil chicken sandwich: a large grilled chicken breast on fresh crusty bread smothered in brie aioli, basil and mushrooms. Their fries - truffle parmesan and otherwise, with tasty unique dips - are addicting. The zinc burger, mac and cheese, hanger steak are all very good. I loved the haricot verts and shitakes and ate the whole plate myself.   However, the best thing I've had here, which is in the top things I've ever eaten in my life I'm so enamored with it,... is the dungeness crab crepe. If you like crab (which you should if you have a tongue) you have to try this and savor every little bite.   I am a fan! Please continue making deliciousness forever."}
{"text":"We have been going to Zinc Bistro for years....went there April 23 and as always had a wonderful meal...HOWEVER...they have raised their price of a cheap cut of meat called Flat Iron Steak by $8 in just a few short weeks. Even the internet  menu (as of yesterday) still shows the price at $26.  AND...here we were in a French restaurant and they were playing Spanish music! What's with that?!?! That was a first. I have nothing against Spanish music when it's playing in a Mexican restaurant...NOT a French Bistro!! Very disappointed to say the least! I'm sure it will be awhile before we can bring ourselves to go back"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants we've ever eaten in! From the front desk, to the beautiful outdoor (heated) patio with candlelight, to the service & food. The oysters & grilled shrimp were perfect. The sauce was great. The dinner for two with homemade onion soup (OMG!) amazing chateaubriand and yummy dessert were all excellent!! Pair this unbelievable service and you shouldn't miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is not really a vegan friendly place, the chef did make me something but it seemed like a very very special undertaking, and the dish was just OK. However, 3 stars because of service and my other meat friends liked this place."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   As I've mentioned before, my dad lives for the latest and greatest in fine dining, and this time, he picked Zinc Bistro in Kierland, North Scottsdale.  ZINC BISTRO  In 2016, Central Bistro in Phoenix sold to New Owner Group, that includes Chef Matt Carter of Zinc Bistro.  Bistro Partners, the group that now owns the restaurant, comprises partners James Shough, Mark Drinkwater, Brian Raab, and Matt Carter; the last being the well-respected chef behind three other restaurants in Scottsdale: Zinc Bistro, The Mission, and The House Brasserie.   Osio Culinary Group founder German Osio says selling Central Bistro, which he opened in 2012, gives the company a chance to \"sharpen our focus on aggressively expanding SumoMaya at a national level,\" according to a press release.   The Osio Culinary Group still operates three other restaurants in metro Phoenix: Local Bistro, SumoMaya, and Kale & Clover.  So what does all that name dropping mean for Zinc Bistro?  Firstly, it means that all of the places listed aren't individual places with individual owners; that many Phoenix/Scottsdale restauranteurs, in fact, are all in bed together, creating some of Phoenix/Scottsdale hotspots.  In regards to Zinc Bistro, it claims to be a \"true New York style Parisian Bistro\" located in the heart of Kierland Commons, in Scottsdale, Arizona, featuring Chef Matt Carter's modern French cuisine.  Owner Terry Ellisor was the first restaurateur in Scottsdale to feature the now popular communal table, which you can find at Zinc Bistro. Whilst sharing with friends you will be overlooking Zinc Bistro's oyster bar.  Zinc Bistro's Chefs, are under the guidance of Chef/Owner Matt Carter and Chef De Cuisine David Bowman.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   My dad said he was taking me to Zinc Bistro and to call for reservations.  When I called for reservations, I was told they had nothing available that day. I told my dad what they told me, so he called, and they immediately got him right in.  So, we popped over for a late lunch.  My immediate impression: Cute but not worth all the drama.  I got the Monte Cristo coffee, which was served with a bowl of salt with a spoon, instead of sugar. Obviously, they replaced the drink. A funny aside, but why serve a $12 coffee drink with a bowl of salt?  My dad tried their delicious cheese board and fries. I tried their freshly steamed mussels In drawn butter, which were very good.  Zinc Bistro's Claim: \"Each of our servers has been accredited as a level one or above sommelier and can offer sincere suggestions based on your preferences.\"  But the service we got was eh, not that great.   I'll be generous and assume it was a one off, but NOTHING about our service/server was at any accreditation level in any topic.  CONCLUSION  Their Motto:  \"Come and spend a day reminiscent of a daydream trip to Paris, be greeted and remembered by a staff that truly strives to give you a very special dining experience, we promise you won't be disappointed.\"  NONE of their motto was accurate.  Nothing about Zinc Bistro is reminiscent of Paris, the staff was rude on the phone and not efficient nor accurate in person, and I was disappointed.  It seems like this establishment is looking to be seen as exceptional. To be considered exceptional, one must be exceptional. At least that's my opinion.  I'm being VERY generous with the rating.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *It's In Kierland: Parking is comme ci comme ça.  *For more information: zincbistroaz.com"}
{"text":"My portion was about 2 spoons full and $21. It's was cold and also under cooked. Nice staff and have enjoyed my experience in the past here. However extremely underwhelmed today."}
{"text":"Had been here couple of times and Always enjoyed my visit. The French food was almost the best in town. There are couple of dishes that I can still name them out that are worth trying -- wine cooked mussels, scallop risotto, foie gras, seafood platter. Never had anything bad here. Server was professional and they can help to make good recommendations on the menu. Decor and ambience makes it a great place for girls night out or a date night."}
{"text":"Wow their food has massively improved since my last trip here. I will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for special occasions!  My family's favorite place as well.  Flat Iron steak is wonderful.  Love their asparagus too.  The bread they serve, freshly made by a local bakery, is wonderful.  Make sure you order the chocolate souffle with your dinner since they make them to order, which takes 30 minutes (mmmm chocolate goodness). Ambiance is very elegant, white table clothes, dim lighting, and wonderful tables in the courtyard."}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times now and have never been disappointed with the simply devine cuisine. Favorite place to sit is in there inner patio, the ambiance is beautiful. Perfect place to go for lunch or early dinner on Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Sean is the most professional and respectful bartenders in the Arizona area! He remembers his regulars and makes the best speciality drinks!    Zinc is definitely a go to spot for late lunch, happy hour and dinner. They have amazing fresh pick of the day oysters, delectable French food and an ambiance that is addicting"}
{"text":"Best place EVER. We travel to Scottsdale every year! And zinc is a must. Especially amazing this time around. Food is fantastic. New manager was a wonderful pick! Love love love! I recommend the mussels as an appetizer...delicious. Servers are knowledgeable about dishes and even wine pairings A+++++++ thank you again for a spectacular meal"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had, and I'm a foodie... The ribeye was sliced, cooked to perfection, and ideally charred and flavored. For dessert, I had a stick made from Frozen lemon custard, rolled in toasted coconut and served over toasted marshmallow sauce drizzled with blueberry coulis. Might just have been the best desert I've ever had....like Baked Alaska, but better!!!!!!!!  The iced tea was berry flavored and delicious."}
{"text":"The place is noisy but that's typical for a bistro. It's just too pricey. We travel often to Los Angeles, where we lived for many years after moving from Paris, France and our bistro in LA, Le Bizou (The Kiss) has the same menu offerings for far less and the owner, Phillipe, is actually from France. Onion soup for $14 is outrageous, we all know the ingredients and the price is not justified. Le Bizou offers the same Steak au Poivre also with pommes frites for $17.95 not $28. If a bistro in Los Angeles can offer the same dishes at a reasonable price why can't Zinc do it. Certainly the overhead in LA has to be much more than in Scottsdale. I am not asking people to travel to Le Bizou but just pointing out the difference in prices compared to the locale."}
{"text":"The spinach and frisee salad followed by the boullaibaise with a glass of alsatian pinot blanc= the perfect meal"}
{"text":"Service = good.  Food = bad.  I ordered the scallops over chorizo risotto.    I would recommend not getting this as the two food main food elements created one salty dish.  2 other people in my party had ordered this and mentioned it was salty.  At the beginning of the meal, I thought it was just fine, but as I got to the middle and end of the meal, it was starting to get really difficult to eat.    Price - on the expensive side for the amount of food we got.  Scallop and Chorizo Risotto  + a Chimay beer = $55.  Everyone was a little dressed up... missed that memo.  Dressed up meaning sports coat and dress shoes.   Would I come here again?  Probably not, uncles I'm absolutely forced to go."}
{"text":"Very bad service and super late notice about closing for the super bowl!! I came driving from Gilbert for 40 minutes!! And reached their by 2:40pm and surprise!! We are closing!!! Defiantly wont come here again!"}
{"text":"Going to keep it short and sweet!  Nice place and cute ambiance.  The burgers and french onion soup are worth trying.  The burgers here are probably one of the best I've had...and so is the french onion soup!  The french onion soup here is a leading competitor to Thomas Keller's at Bouchon in Napa."}
{"text":"Zinc has amazing Mac n' cheese with bits of ham in it, and if you get there early enough for brunch, try the croque madame. The atmosphere is very cute but some of the staff is not very helpful. It really depends on who your server is.   Great food, a bit pricey, and service will either be fantastic or very disappointing depending on who has your table."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's a bit pricey, but if you're looking for great french food this is the place. I love the tuna tartare. I get it every time!"}
{"text":"all i can say, is I am in heaven every time I go there  either lunch or dinner both menus are great!"}
{"text":"A classy little bistro in the upscale Kierland shopping venue, this is the perfect stop for a meal or a snack. Absolutely our fave when in north Scottsdale. The latest treasure was for brunch, softly scrambled eggs with marscapone and smoked salmon piled in a crock...divine! We've never been disappointed here...be sure to ask to sit in the courtyard!"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot of great things about this place, so the hubby and I decided to try it for Valentine's Day this year.  Not sure what happened in the communication, but I am sure that we won't be going back. To start out with, I was upset about the FLYING COCKROACH that crawled out of my salad.  I had to flag down three waiters to remove the item from my table.  No one wanted to help until I actually found my own waiter.  They replace the chopped salad with a new one, which was mediocre at best.  After the salad and before the entree, ANOTHER COCKROACH walked off of our table, which is when I yelled for help.  The owner came by and made a joke of it; there was no apology.  In retrospect, I should have walked out.  Perhaps I'll just call the Department of Health?"}
{"text":"Um, I really expected better. I came here for lunch today and I got the shaved grilled chicken salad based on our server's recommendation. He stated it was a popular salad so I went for it. I was not impressed. It was practically a Caesar Salad that tasted like nothing. With tip, I ended up paying $20!! $20 for a tasteless salad.  Maybe if I ordered other items off the menu other than the salads, I would be happy..."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Phoenix! Come on the Chef/Owner used to be the Poissonnier at the French Laundry! AKA the fish Chef for one of the best restaurants in the world. So obviously I would recommend the Mussels appetizer and Scallop entree. Service is old school great, you might have 3-4 servers quietly hovering around your table anticipating your every need. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant hands down! Great ambiance, amazing food and service. Have been coming here over 10 years and still exceeding expectations!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed for a couple of reasons.  One, the service was mixed, our waiter was ok but had to be reminded of what we wanted.  Then the food took over 45 minutes to show up.  And no one seemed to remember who ordered what, they seemed confused and busy even though the restaurant was nearly empty.   The food was pretty good, depending on what you get.  I had to re-order my green beans and it still wasn't correct."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro needs a reboot. Once delicious, light, precise and innovative, the restaurant has completely become complacent...and now proportionally too expensive.  Scottsdale is a foodies playground.  Diners are relatively sophisticated and frankly, Zinc is doomed on this path.  I haven't enjoyed Zinc Bistro for two years , and even then, it was only for lunch.  Dinner with close friend willing to meet around Kierland plus a recent, perhaps overzealous, review in Phoenix Magazine put Zinc back on the agenda.  Hostess Desk and Bar:  both are strong in service and perhaps the highlights that are keeping Zinc from the one-star category.  Drinks are creative and the bartenders truly demonstrate they know their craft.  But a perfect score in this category is hindered by the owners/managers that have decided straight bourbon pours should be $14 for a stingy 2oz and copious ice.  Bar sales are the backbone of any restaurant profits.  Selling volume is the better approach than this money-grab pricing.  Dinner/ Wait Staff:  the menu is shallow.  It does not sell technique nor invite the diner to be daring.  The wait staff, even listening in on the adjacent tables, clearly do not command the cooking techniques nor have sampled the entire menu.  Again, this is a managerial failure in poor training and probably an extension of the thrifty focus to squeeze a dime.  Our meal was quite drawn out.  Drinks took a very long time to arrive and it killed the usual impetus to order broadly.  Partially defeated, we ordered a halibut that, now two days later, I can't even recall enough of an impression to comment further, salmon that twice came to the table dried out like smoked Norwegian fish and the chateaubriand.  Buckle up, because I am going to rant hard about this dish they are overcharging and drooping folks called \"chateaubriand.\"  Classically, this is a thick French center cut roast for two or even three people cooked no more than medium, often served with potatoes.  They got the potatoes right...in that they were served, but utterly flavorless.  The not-even-two-inch-thick meat came cooked well done, no hint of pink nor juices on the plate and I sincerely question if it was even a center cut as one edge contained a partial rind of fat.  This is one of the most expensive items on the menu and in no arena should it command this price tag nor such kitchen butchery of a French classic.  Dessert:  We had no patience to try.  Waiter comped the salmon and \"meat dish.\"  Manager never was present.  I left embarrassed that I suggested this place to meet.  Cheesecake Factory performs better.  Eat that."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been a few times, never disappoints. To be fair, I have only been for brunch and lunch.   This place is very popular. Make reservations!   French press coffee is excellent.  French onion soup is amazing. It's a little pricey when you consider that it's just a cup of soup, but it's worth it. Kind of hard to justify getting an entree after spending $14 on the soup though.   This time I skipped the soup and had the ham and Gruyere cheese omelet. Light, fluffy, great flavors with cream fraiche on top. Served with a small house salad and matchstick potatoes on the side. Delicious! I want one now just writing this review.   Be sure to ask for bread service. They get it fresh from an outside local bakery daily. Excellent!   Next time you are up by Kierland Commons stop by Zico Bistro!  I can't wait to try it for dinner!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING!!! I ordered the coq au vin and my wife ordered the pastrami sandwich. It is hard to find good French food in this area. Both were prepared perfectly and the waitress was very polite. The staff were accommodating and seated us away from the loud are up front as we requested. The pricing is very reasonable and the staff were all wonderful and polite. We will definitely be back very soon, we might even make it a weekly date."}
{"text":"Overall, we had really good food and drinks for dinner here. Hit a bit of a snaffu when I ordered the halibut (they didn't have any) and an aviation (they didn't have one of the liquors that goes in the drink), both of which are on their menu. Ended up splitting the smoked salmon (AMAZING - definitely get it!) and getting the scallops for my main (really good). One of my friends thought her steak was overly salty, but it may be a personal preference."}
{"text":"I love the dungeness crab salad and their burger and fries!  The French Onion soup is also delicious!  I love to sit outside in the garden, or if I am by myself, the bar is great and you can meet a lot of nice people as the bartenders there are terrific!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat!!, excellent service and food and a nice outside table view!! Very courteous service and great food!"}
{"text":"the truffle fries are amazing, the pink lemonade too, the service, just everything. this place was so great we came here twice on our trip! once just the two of us, then again when my mom finally came in. I also loved the dipping sauces."}
{"text":"This is an update from my previous review. Had to attend a business lunch last week and thought \"oh no\" when I found out Zinc Bistro was the chosen destination. There were ten people in our party we sat outside in the back garden patio area. As stated in my previous review service was very very slow. No prompt refills on iced tea. Delivery of appetizers, entrees etc... took an exorbitant amount of time to be delivered. It was recommended by another member of the group to try the \"Duck Confit\" sandwich. Worst sandwich I've ever had! The duck was dry, tasteless, shredded \"gunk.\" The group ordered the mussel appetizer which was served in a flavorless broth. The \"Pate Maison\" tasted like it was weeks old with, again, no flavor. Other members of the party commented that the food was average at best and overpriced. It's a good thing I didn't pay for this meal out of my pocket. As I said in my previous review, \"don't waste your hard earned money at this lousy place.\""}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the service.  Ashley attended to two of us on Friday night, in a wonderfully professional manner.   She allowed us to taste 2 wines before we settled on a bottle choice.  I  recall it was a bordeaux (and offered by the glass)  at the $60 point and very drinkable.  I had a special of the evening, the veal chop.  And I always enjoy a good veal chop when offered.  It was a nice piece of meat an cooked expertly accompanied by some mushrooms and sauce.  The only drawback of the dish was the side potatoes were only warm at best accompanying the dish.    Also ordered were the scallops which were again very well prepared and served.   Good work Zinc, see you in a future visit!"}
{"text":"All I'm going to say about this place is that I've seen the workers multiple times in the trash area at Kierland Commons storing/preparing food back there. Items included lettuce heads, breads, and macaroni and cheese.   DISGUSTING. I'm not making this up.    Unfortunately, I contacted Health Services about this, and when someone came to inspect the trash area there was no food back there.  (I, along with co-workers, noticed this on the daily back in high school when I worked at Cold Stone)."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Scottsdale I make my friends go with me to Zinc Bistro it is my tradition and one of my favorite French restaurants I have been to. Here are some observations....  * super cute ambiance definitely urban Paris compared to rustic countryside. * Location is great in Kierland for shopping before or after * Amazing menu and the most amazing Lemon Souffle I have ever had in my life. I pretty much dream about it and wake up drooling. * For all of you saying its \"snobby\" wake up, really though? You are in SCOTTSDALE everything is snobby so just take it in and ignore the snobbery and enjoy the ambiance and food.  *yes it may be slow but why do we have to be fast?   I can't wait to go back its a top fav for me."}
{"text":"Lunch here is delicious and well worth it.  Dinner?  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.  If it's easy-earned money and you don't care to spend then by all means enjoy the authentic atmosphere and above average French food... just don't order the flat iron steak."}
{"text":"I wish I had better things to say about this place but I don't! The atmosphere is wonderful as we sat in the courtyard. However, our server was terrible. He rushed us to take out order and he had a nasty attitude to boot. We ordered a bottle of wine and had soup and salad. My soup was great but our salads weren't anything to write home about.  Once I got home, I checked my account balance and out waiter charged me twice for the meal! Wth!"}
{"text":"We were doing some shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and around Kierland and had decided to eat lunch here. I had read past reviews and had always wanted to try it. It was also really cute decor. I have been to France several times and felt they really nailed the \"bistro\" look so I was excited. However as soon as we walked in, the hostess immediately stopped us and explained that they have a dress code: men in tank tops are not allowed. As she's saying this, I see a family with small children wearing regular, casual clothing and another young woman dressed about as casual as you can get.  Let me preface that this was late June with temperatures over 100 on a Saturday at lunch. I can understand a dress code for dinner but lunch? Here in Phoenix? Really?? I've been to weddings where people wore flip flops. I've lived all over and phoenix is by far a very casual place because its so hot. I was pretty surprised. Granted, the hostess wasn't rude about it but I guess I didn't see the place as being that high end. Needless to say, we left and went to North instead. Their staff was incredibly friendly. What a difference. I guess Zinc is taking the French thing literally."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere!  We stopped by chance on our way to the movies. 3 different meals and all where outstanding. Ask for Frankie, he was an amazing waiter. He was knowledgeable, friendly and entertaining.  Try the Foie gras, so delicious!"}
{"text":"For a French wine bistro this place is not too shabby.  The restaurant has a nice, parisian ambiance and the food is excellent.  After really good suggestions from our waitress, I ordered the sous-vied filet w/ fois gras, my fiance got the scallops risotto and we split the onion soup.  I was initially hesitant about sous-vied meat, and since I'm from New England, I don't really get my hopes up with seafood in the desert--but both hit the spot! My one negative is the sloooow, but excellent service.  Good thing we had bread to chow on."}
{"text":"Very nice French  atmosphere . French cuisine, beautiful outdoor as well as indoor, in the heart of the great Kirkland outdoor mall. Food and service great as always. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bloody. Hell. Total #mindblowing eatery, here. For realz, yo.  Great location, nestled at Kierland in N. Scottsdale. Decor and ambience breathed quaint (but not pretentious or stiff) cafe in rural town somewhere in France.  Two, yes two, patios that patrons may dine. There's a pation to the left of the front entrance that is pretty practical and allows ample ppl watching, or there's an \"atrium\" like patio that's to the left of the inside dining area which looked amazing. Lush greens and shaded area. *swoon*  Tried the 3 cheese sampler plate (a Blue Cheese, an uber creamy Brie-type, and another hard Havarti like one). Cheeses were paired w/variety of breads (rye, wheat, etc), along w/walnuts, fruit spread, and warm (yes, warm) green olives. NOTE - this is a bit naughty... I thought I was gonna jizz in my pants, it was so good. Yes, I went there.   I had the mac-n-cheese and it was an epic moment. The shizz was served piping hot w/ham slices and homemade cheese chunks.  Service was attentive and helpful. OMG, Zinc, you are so it for me. I'll be back soon.-"}
{"text":"Great ambiance.....nice patio area....good bar.  Nice wine list!  While not in France, it's pretty much as close as you'll get in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"If you haven't caught on yet, get the mussels! I was very hesitant at first because all I had heard about mussels were that they were generally slimy and hard to swallow. Not here! They were AMAZING! The broth that they are in is easily THE best broth I have ever had! I ate at least two of their bowls of bread dipped in the broth alone! Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Ive found the food to be very good here and the service to be above average. What I do see are alot of ridiculous people eating there. Just fo your info, it's annoying when someone sits at a table in a restaurant and only orders espresso. That table is for people who want to EAT and that table is where the waiter earns a living. It's not a park bench. I've found that waiters are generally only rude to rude people. Treat them and their space with a little respect.  I think this is an above average restaurant with nice wine prices, good (and sometimes great!) food, and good service."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place with my best girl friends!  The food is always delicious and fresh and the highest quality.  I seem to always get the same thing (basil chicken and brie sandwich with a side of french fries -- hands down the best chicken sandwich in Arizona.)  But the entire menu is appealing.  If you love good food and a relaxing experience, you'll love it here.  When the weather is nice, the patio is the way to go."}
{"text":"What a great place to bring a date and sit on the outside patio in watch everybody walked by.   Food is pretty good also but the service in especially our waitress was great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs was there recently service great food terrific. All salads are great. The deserts very yummy and has a bit of a bar scene"}
{"text":"We came here during Restaurant Week and were not disappointed! We liked it so much, we came back another day for lunch and can't wait to come back again! For Restaurant Week, we made reservations at 6:30pm. We made the mistake of thinking Zinc was inside the Scottsdale Quarter, not Kierland Commons. However, it was a short walk over and it was nice to see the different shopping areas. Upon our arrival, it wasn't necessary for a reservation, as the place wasn't too busy. They had seating both inside and out - we chose outside since it was still cool enough to enjoy the weather.   We were brought water and bread with butter. Our waitress showed up next and she was super nice and helpful. We placed our orders - I chose the onion soup, medium rare flat iron steak, and chocolate soufflé with Valrhona chocolate sauce. My husband ordered the pork torchon with grilled Brussels sprouts, grilled swordfish, and chocolate soufflé with Gran Mariner chocolate sauce.   Our first course arrived shortly and it was fantastic. I loved my soup - with the crisp and goey cheese on top and warm oniony goodness below. I didn't want to share. My husband's pork torchon was good, but not my favorite. (It was like a pate - he liked it but said he'd order something different next time.) Then came our entrees. My steak looked and tasted amazing. It had a peppery sauce on it and it melted in my mouth. It came with pomme frites - which my husband liked more than me. My husband's swordfish presentation was beautiful and just as tasty. The swordfish was like a steak in itself - sort of like a tuna steak. It wasn't a flaky fish at all. Then the cous-cous that came with it was delicious with tiny bits of pork in it. Both entrees were delicious. Finally, dessert. Oh man. I poured all the chocolate sauce on my soufflé and dug it - it was so warm and delicious. My husband's Gran Mariner sauce was just as delicious but not as thick as mine. Overall, it was a great experience.  Our next lunch date here was just as good but definitely not as decadent. I ordered the omelet with ham and gruyere cheese. This came with a side stack of potatoes au gratin. My husband ordered the seafood bouillabaisse which I thought was tasty.   We will definitely be back for dinner again soon. I can already taste the steak and soufflé!"}
{"text":"Having a lovely glass of Burgundy! The service is great, wonderful hosts and bartender!!"}
{"text":"Great place if you are craving french onion soup. Delicious chocolate souffle. The main course wasn't amazing but the soup and dessert is worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Amazeballs. That's French for something good, right?  It's not...It's English for freaking amazing, which is the best way I could possibly describe Zinc Bistro. Top to bottom, a fantastic meal.  Started with Duck pate, my wife had a salad,  we each had the flat iron steak at the recommendation of the server, and we shared a chocolate souffle for dessert.  Going piece by piece...Salad was very good, fresh greens, vinaigrette and a warm chevre crouton that was delicious. The duck pate was very flavorful and rich, served with marbled rye bread, an herb infused creme fraiche, cornichon, and some sort of meat gelee (which weirded me out). That was a dynamite appetizer, incredibly rich and satisfying.   Our flat iron steaks were cooked to medium rare perfection, pepper crusted, and finished with a red wine reduction and shallots, which created an awesome sauce to dip the pomme frites that came with the steak. Special shout out to the chef(s) at Zinc, the steaks were really cooked perfectly. So often even at really top end steak houses, medium rare can mean medium. This was not the case at Zinc, which I appreciated. Pomme frites were great, crispy and flavorful, and were awesome when dipped in the sauce.  The souffle to finish was incredible. You get your choice of a finishing sauce (we chose chocolate), so you get the cakey exterior, warm, soft interior, molten center and then the sauce that pairs well with the whole thing. A wonderful way to cap the meal.  I had a Manhattan after dinner that was good, service was very good, timely and attentive, with spot recommendations as well. I also love the atmosphere at Zinc. They do a nice job making it feel Parisian (without the smoking and the judgement...I kid, France...I kid).  All in all a wonderful meal, and I am sure to be back to Zinc soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped here the other afternoon for a quick drink - It was a beautiful sunny afternoon in Scottsdale and I was out shopping and maybe quite possibly afternoon restaurant/bar hopping! I was slightly enjoying the fact that everyone else in the country was in a deep freeze and here I am in beautiful sunny 75 degree in January Scottsdale Az. We sat down and ordered a couple bloody mary's and then my eyes rested upon the fresh oyster display they had next to the bar - I LOVE oysters and frankly I had to try some! I ordered half a dozen oysters - I can't remember exactly where the oysters were from, but I ordered two of each of the available oysters. All 3 varieties were fresh and delicious! Service was great and our bloody mary's complimented the oysters perfectly! I can't wait to come back here for a leisurely lunch."}
{"text":"I spotted Zinc Bistro while shopping at Kierland Commons and it reminded me of Balthazar in NYC, which I love, so I just had to come back back for dinner. From the beginning I really wanted to like Zinc Bistro however the service was pretty bad and the food was subpar at best.   We came for a late dinner on a Friday night without reservations and were immediately seated at a lovely little table on the patio. The mood was festive and lively...so far so good.   Unfortunately it all went downhill from there. Our server wasn't the least bit friendly, attentive or accommodating. The only times I actually saw her was when she took our food and drink order and dropped the check. She never checked if we wanted another round or how our food was. The food took forever after we placed our order, like 45 minutes, and once it was finally brought out it was not only wrong but cold as well. I was tempted to just leave and go a few doors down to The Greene House where I had a much more enjoyable lunch.   Overall I wouldn't recommend Zinc Bistro for anything more than drinks and maybe a light snack. It has potential to be a charming brasserie but they really need to work on service and quality control."}
{"text":"I probably would have given it a 3 star rating (very trendy and spendy not a \"bistro\" see review by TT) but my date loved it so I had better give it 4 stars. I had the lamb shank which was more than slightly over done. The scallops were however excellent. The mussel appetizers were good but pretty hard to blow that. Service was solid but a little slow. I had the house french bordeaux wine which was also good. They also have a nice Sancerre by the glass. The bar area looked \"interesting\" and was moderately crowded with elderly Manthers all hooked up with women half there age. Oh that famous Scottsdale bar scene!  I may return for a cocktail or three :-)......"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Their patio is beautiful.  Staff is fast and professional. Big 5 stars"}
{"text":"The food is fanatic here. The outdoor sitting is just perfect for a glass of wine and light lunch in a sunny day"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Went here with a friend. Really enjoyed the foie gras and cheese selections. I had the chicken with gnocchi- though this is a French inspired restaurant they have a nice mix of entrees and appetizers. Wine menu was decent.  Had a French martini. Definitely worth coming back to"}
{"text":"The food was very impressive. My table got a dozen oysters (Price Edward Island) and the presentation was done to perfection and the flavor was great. I got the French Onion Soup and the Pate and it was as good as I have had.   We were seated on the outside patio and the weather was in the low 90's and it was really nice. The people watching is great because it is part of the outdoor mall... Kierland Commons."}
{"text":"I. loved. this. place. my favorite spot I tried while in AZ this week. it was so good I was longing for my favorite Uptown girl to be there dining with me.  i started off with a cocktail called rye direction. that was definitely a step in the...  I had the Scottish salmon with onion ravioli. every last bite had more flavor than Public Enemy. I was blown away and damn near licked the plate clean. and then to follow it up with the bread pudding - which is such an understatement, because it is so, so much more. I forget how it is referred to in French; please accept my apologies.  my colleague ordered the chocolate soufflé that was oooooowee goodie good. (I finish off all of her desserts after she has a couple bites.)  this would be a great date spot.  I would definitely come here again if ever in the area. *rubs magic lamp*"}
{"text":"FRENCH BISTRO STYLE STRAIGHT FROM PARIS. FINEST QUALITY MODERN FRENCH TO BE HAD IN PHOENIX.  In the vast wasteland that is North Scottsdale, there are but few jewels among the cookie-cutter chains. Zinc Bistro stands in defiance of those mere reflections serving the most excellent of haute cuisine in its stalwart selections at lunch or dinner.  Whether it be TRUFFLE OMELET or the ZINC BURGER or the newly added TOMATO BISQUE or the perennial CRAB SALAD (ladies-who-lunch revolted when chef updated the presentation), combined with the fabulous bread (served on request), a glass of Chateau Greysac, and the heavenly CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE (don't forget to order it in advance), it's a meal fit for a proper two-hour French luncheon.  The daily specials never cease to amaze. Just be sure to arrive by 11:30 if you hope to get one; they go fast!  My other favorites include the scrumptiously delicate and rich SCALLOPS WITH LENTILS, the PRIME FLAT IRON STEAK with a delectable reduction and aromatic rosemary, and of course, the ONION SOUP GRATINEE.  Chef Carter's pedigree shows in his food, meticulously prepared: Cordon Bleu, Chef Christopher Gross (of Christopher's, now at the Biltmore Fashion Park), and Chef Dennis Keller  Not to be missed. Whether you find yourself in Kierland town or looking for an excuse to explore what used to be Frank Lloyd Wright's \"desert view\" turned city, Zinc Bistro is the crown jewel."}
{"text":"We went in at that odd hour when happy hour ends and the lull before dinner service starts.  That could of been reason to not get good service or food but Zinc didn't miss a step.  The food was great, I love their baked French onion soup!  The duck was amazing and my wife's short ribs were so flavorful.  Highly recommend zinc"}
{"text":"I've never been to Paris.  But if this is just a fraction of what an actual french bistro is like, then sign me up for a trip.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed a very pleasurable Valentine's Day meal together at Zinc.  We actually went out on the night before Valentine's day because we have odd schedules and we wanted to avoid the crowds.  But as you can imagine, a highly regarded french restaurant was still fairly slammed.  The dining room was packed and it was very noisy.  I don't know if there is anything they could do about the acoustics, but it was awfully tough for me to hear our waitress at times.  It also is pretty dark inside.  Not quite as bad as a couple of Yelpers have complained about, but I could image why it may be too dark for some.  The french onion soup was a reputation for being superb.  I'll agree that it's excellent.  Not the best.  But you won't regret ordering it. I had the seared ahi, which was awesome.  Not only was the fish cooked perfectly, and the thinly shaved ham, crab, and potatoes compliment the tuna quite well, but the presentation of the dish was a work of art.  It was almost a shame to eat it.  My girlfriend tried the short ribs.  Zinc continues to prove my theory that there's no such thing as bad short ribs.  The bread that's served with the meal is also great.  It has that burnt bottom crust that just tells you it was made right.  When we ordered our meals, the waitress advised us to give her a heads up early if we wanted the chocolate souffle (like any good souflle, it takes a half hour to bake).  Yes, please!  And we were sure glad we did.  Both of us were quite stuffed when it arrived, but that didn't stop us from devouring it.  It was light and sweet and the chocolate sauce was to die for."}
{"text":"As a general rule it is a bad sign when a restaurant is too dark to read the menu (and presumably see your food). Another general rule is that a waiter starting with a terse \"no\" will lead to a bad evening. Lastly the manager not acknowledging an issue and even trying to deflect it indicates that no good will ever come from the dinning experience. Fortunately we left before getting started and am better for it.  Having researched Zinc Bistro  I was excited to eat there. Unfortunately when we got there in the evening we found the interior to be very dark. Dark enough that it was hard to read the menu (I have very good eyesight). My wife politely asked if they could turn up the lights and the waiter responded with a terse \"NO\" and then proceed to offer to get us a flashlight. I talked to the manager about the waiters attitude and the issue of the lighting and he was dismissive and deflected the issue saying that they had alot of flashlights around. We also noticed that other patrons where using their iPhones to illuminate the menu so it wasn't just us. All I have to ask is why in the world if you know it is an issue (to the point of having several flashlights ready) would you subject your patrons to the inconvenience. We left and will never return. There are so many options for great dining (e.g. Roka Akor) in Scottsdale, don't waste your time on a restaurant that doesn't deliver even basic customer service. The choice is yours."}
{"text":"Incredible meal, service and atmosphere!!!  Our server Frankie was outstanding....his recommendations were perfect for every course and his warm personality was wonderful.  My scallops were a highlight and my wife said the French onion soup was the best she has ever had.  We finished w/ the beignets....better than Cafe Du Monde and paired w/ 3 incredible dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Table for one..nice wine list..fresh oysters..fresh bread.  Spinach and frisee salad with poached egg is amazingly delicious.  The flat iron steak is very good...heavily pepper crusted and undercooked at the med rare, but tasty.  Pomme frites are nicely seasoned with smokey paprika, but need to be much crisper to be called frites.  Nice place, pleasant atmosphere..would come back."}
{"text":"09/23/10  My first of two Restaurant Week 2010 experiences began at Zinc Bistro.  Let me preface that I took Mom w/ me, and it was this meal's experience that I have learned never to take her to a place that ranks higher than a \"moderate\" in terms of costs.  It doesn't matter that she's not the one paying, and I refuse to let someone, not even my mother, dissuade me from enjoying a great meal!  We'd arrived 30 minutes before dinner service, and Mom was already hungry.  I tried stalling for about 15 minutes, looking over the off-hour menu for something for her to nibble on.  (We also found it difficult to flag down someone to help us during our stay here, even though it wasn't busy!)  I decided I'd get her the open-faced Zinc Burger, which was listed at $13.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A#MgpZeM3N2f8wi6EuEbjd3A  The menu didn't list a side dish accompanying it, so I asked our server if there were any fries or salad that came w/ it.  No was the answer.  This angered my Mom, who did not wish for me to pay $13 for just a burger.  She only had the ambience (of which she thought wasn't great) and the arrogance of our server to go on; I knew of Chef Matt Carter's reputation, as well as Chef Beau MacMillan's endorsement of the best French onion soup (at Zinc Bistro) he's ever tasted on Food Network's episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate: Cheesy.  Those 25 minutes waiting for the burger to arrive were the longest 25 minutes I've ever experienced in my life, no exaggeration!  Thank God that when the burger finally did arrive, that it was a VERY tasty burger!  Of course, she wouldn't admit this to me.  No... I only learnt of her approval when our server had asked us later on if we were enjoying our food-- a very enthusiastic yes was her reply!  My restaurant week meal thus followed:   1st course: Smoked Scottish salmon tartare- green apple, creme fraiche, and toasted brioche.  A truly lovely dish to gaze at, and even more wonderful to taste!  I loved the texture of the salmon- very creamy, and the cubed hard-boiled eggs added some fun mouth-feel!  This dish made me think I was eating salmon sushi w/o the rice!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw#z--Qcv88vRbjCa_KUDY7Hw  2nd course: Seared Ahi Tuna- preserved lemon creamy orzo, roasted beet, and fennel.  Another winner!  Great presentation-- seared ahi tuna chunks, w/ red centers atop wonderfully creamy orzo (Mom's first time trying orzo... she loved it!), with a beet reduction glazing the dish.  Really enjoyed the meaty tuna chunks, which tasted fresh-from-the-sea and not \"fishy\" at all.  Again, the orzo added great texture contrast to the meaty fish-- I enjoyed this dish so much, I had the leftovers for breakfast the next day! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg#SHDk_-fvZRXr4O82qOEKFg  3rd course: Apple \"Tart Tatin\" Brown Butter Caramel, which really wasn't a tart tatin.  It wasn't even a pie, which was a bit disappointing.  It consisted of a cake that looked like angel cake but had the texture of a pound cake, apple-flavored, and quite dry.  Not even the brown butter caramel sauce nor the house-made ice cream could save it. :( [I was told it was either a cream cheese, sour cream, or buttermilk- based, but all I tasted was vanilla.]  My favorite components of this dessert were the three, caramelized and very thin-sliced pieces of apple.  We also enjoyed the French-pressed coffee, which also came w/ one piece of biscotti each, that I chose to accompany this \"tart tatin.\"  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw#M8rhOQyLbDHHNTSq7nF6gw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zinc-bistro-scottsdale?select=sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ#sXKSvx7P8pLPKLeZPdLHeQ  4 stars overall for the food, and less than 3 stars for the arrogance and absenteeism of our server and for the ambience.  (We didn't like the flow of the rooms: the tables were too close to each other, and while there was a lovely mini-Eiffel Tower on display, on its base sat containers filled w/ artificial sweeteners- a bit tacky, I thought.)    I wouldn't mind ordering the Zinc burger again, but please add a side dish to it!  And lose the arrogant servers.  Unless, of course, they have sexy French accents to go along w/ their dispositions!  (Pa dum dum!)"}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and stopped in Zinc Bistro for lunch, per a friend's recommendation.   I'm a sucker for duck, so it's no surprise that I was completely enamored with the crispy duck confit sandwich. It was prepared superbly - every bite was to be enjoyed!  I got a side of the fries. The fries themselves were good (nothing spectacular, but when ARE fries spectacular?), but the sauces they came with were outstanding. One appeared to be a \"fancy\" ketchup (small tomato chunks! seasoned!) and one was a mysterious cup of heaven. I devoured it, despite my best efforts to look respectable.  The service was similarly outstanding. My waiter, (Jason B? I could be wrong - skimmed the receipt for a name) suggested a great wine, was prompt, charming, and let me sit and enjoy my meal without pestering me as some other waiters are apt to do.   I sat outside and enjoyed the fantastic weather - it wasn't loud, and everyone kept their conversations to themselves. It was a polite, slightly upscale crowd and everyone seemed to have a good time.  I will absolutely come back here next time I'm in town - and I will enthusiastically recommend it to friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"After dining at Zinc, I felt like Tina Turner after being beaten with one of Ike's boots; in  a word, defeated.  Oh, the food was good. And the service, splendid. But the price for lunch with tip was seventy-five dollars which, doesn't mean anything until I tell you how there wasn't enough food between the two of our selections to feed an anorexic teenage girl.  Seventy five bucks in this case bought a bowl of bouillabaisse, a small salad and two glasses of water. When we realized we were going to need more food, (about the time the entrees arrived) we went for the pomme frites.  We left hungrier than when we arrived - how is that possible?  I wished I had an entourage of Guantanamo Bay Marines with me that day, I'd have ordered a \"Code Red\" on the maitre d' and his staff for gypping me out of my 75 bucks."}
{"text":"Forgot to eat lunch at lunch time again.... Stopped by Zinc to find they were only serving from their afternoon menu but it looked good to us so we decided to give it a try.  Can recommend the Zinc Burger....open faced with bacon and blue cheese...very tasty! The Pate was not quite what I expected...it was very flavorsome but I had expected a different texture and taste...it was served  as a slab that needed to be cut rather than spread...I also would have preferred a plain baguette rather than the marble bread that it was served with....the Bordeaux that I had was very good though...cannot remember the name and it is not on their online menu.  But this is the BEST part .... Dessert! : ) Once again not meant to be ordering dessert till the holiday indulgences are paid for but oh well .... this was yet again one that was not meant to be missed....THE ZINC VALRONA CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE with warm Grand Marnier Sauce : ) .... Chocolate heaven.   Their cappucinos are also very good and served with biscotti.   Zinc is a lovely little spot whether you are sitting inside or outside and the staff are five star."}
{"text":"I got a sandwich that was bathed in butter for $16. Next time I think about going here I'll just eat two butter sticks from the fridge and visit my grandmothers house."}
{"text":"Dined here twice....or tried.  Once for lunch.  Which was delicious and a wonderful experience.  Great lunch menu and the waiter was super.  Went back for dinner this evening....and the waitress was so pretentious and unhelpful and downright rude that our party of five left before we ordered. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The reviews do not lie!!  Truly the best French Onion Soup I have ever had!!  The entire menu was great!  So many options.  We also had the Mac and Cheese and a Risotto dish.  All were good enough to make us want to go back really soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been excited to try Zinc for years, and for whatever reason I always forget about it and we always end up walking to Green House. Next time we'll keep walking and I won't give Zinc another thought.  What I liked: the cheese, the wine, and the atmosphere. Problems: The food and the service.   After enjoying the cheeseboard the server highly recommended the scallops. They turned out to be very southwestern, which seems weird for a French restaurant. Also of note: the house salad is a pile of lettuce with dressing, and some toast with a smattering of goat cheese. Not bad, but not actually a salad in my opinion.   Other than that they did rectify my husband's over-cooked steak.   Lastly, the server told me why I didn't understand that the scallops were good, told my husband to order his steak differently, and licked the wine carafe after pouring my glass of wine.   If it weren't for the service we'd go back for cheese and wine aps before dining elsewhere, but now we'll just skip it all together."}
{"text":"Every bite was amazing!!! Our server had the best suggestions!! If you didn't like this place - stop being so stuck up. The menu, preparation, and service was worth every penny."}
{"text":"The wife dragged me out shopping last weekend, and insisted on Zinc for lunch. I was skeptical at first, but as we made our way inside I was reassured by the atmosphere. We were able to get a table in their inside/outside section and it was really beautiful. A great day for lunch and I fully recommend eating in this part of the restaurant if you have the opportunity.   The menu is very interesting and very French, ranging from steaks to sandwiches. I ended up going with the Confit Duck sandwich. The wife tried to talk me out it, \"you always order duck and you never like it\" she claimed. But there was something about sizzling pieces of dark duck meat sauteed in their own fat that just had my attention so I went for it.   It came on a brioche bun, that was soft and delicious. The confit duck and pickled red onion was fabulous! I loved every bite. We had a side of frites (fries) that were also very delicious. That and a couple of beers on their inside/outside patio dealio with the sun shining and I could not complain. I will definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"The staff us second to none.  They know the wine and the food. Awesome place to have dinner."}
{"text":"This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so don't be surprised if you eat something you like and it's not there next time."}
{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale I loved dining here.  It can be pricey put the food is worth every penny.  Best Souffle and french pressed coffee I have ever had.  The entrees are small but rich in flavor where you savor every bite.  Definitely a must if visiting Scottsdale.  You will never guess you are in the middle of the desert if you're sitting out in the quaint patio with the romantic lighting in the evenings.  It will transport you to Paris France with the ambiance, service and of course the food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal, great service and very relaxing despite the uppity area and restaurant type.  The grilled chicken Caesar is perfect and recently I enjoyed the tomato bisque paired with a crostini LOADED with crap tossed in a light vinaigrette that was seriously OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the bar and outside seating at this place.  I haven't eaten here, but love the atmosphere.  It was nice to find a place that feels so cozy and romantic and not like a giant chain restaurant, like the rest this city.  It's a great place to share a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Excellent menu and authentic French cuisine, true bistro-style! Superb wine list, amazing desserts, and all of the food is A-1! Great patio to people watch."}
{"text":"Ok but not great. Everything was over salted. I ordered the crab crepe appetizer....salty!  The scallops entree were so salty I nearly sent them back.  Portions are small but you'd expect that in a place like this. It's strange because after living in France for ten years I never experienced the super small portion phenomenon like you do in French bistros in the states. It is a very busy and loud place but the service was still good. Ordered the French presse coffee and it was really weak.  We let it steep longer and it was still weak. If you want to go to a busy place, people watch and linger at your table it's a good location. I should have gotten the moulles et frites!"}
{"text":"I give Zinc 4 1/2 Stars.    I have been to Zinc three times now - Once for a lovely date dinner, once for lunch with my mom, and once with the BF for an anniversary lunch.   The first time we went we did the whole appetizers, meal, dessert, wine.  It was lovely and tasty evening.  Service was spectacular.   Both lunches were up the the same level.  But this last time we discovered the key to what put this place over the top for me.   We decided to split the shaved chicken salad and house frites. I had a glass of savignon blanc.  Very enjoyable lunch to enjoy while soaking in some January Scottsdale sun.  So we added on dessert - the apple dessert.  It was delicious and will be one of my favorite apple desserts available at a restaurant.  It is a moist apple cake, with carmel crisped apples at the side and a light with wonderful flavor gelato at top.  So wonderful.   Zinc is wonderful - would fully recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Our waiter Nick was helpful with food and wine recommendations.  The food was amazing, everything from the foie gras risotto to the creme brûlée impressed the palate.  This also seems like a nice place to have a drink at the bar.  I also had the filet with foie gras on top and was blown away by the flavor, and I am a little hard to please when it comes to steaks, this exceeded my expectations!  Will be back next time I visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice! Mussels are a must and the onion soup is also a great option. They also offer good choice of French wines. We went in the evening and were delighted to have dinner in the garden. Desserts are also delicious: we tried the Zinc souffle and the vanilla creme brulée."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is a wonderful French Bistro. The salads are very good. One of my favorites is their cheese, fruit and nut platter. They have an amazing variety of cheeses and they are delicious.  The flavors come alive when you eat them with a piece of fruit, nut, olive or jam. I love outdoor sitting. It is cozy. If you love chocolate, order their chocolate dessert. It takes about 20 minutes to bake but it's worth the wait. Rich and flavorful. Will definitely continue to return."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for lunch!   First time here and was greeted instantly at the front door. Enjoyed French soup, the basil chicken sandwich and a bottle of Trimbach pinot Blanc.   Everything was very delicious and the ambiance is even better! Eiffel Tower in the center of the restaurant, huge bulbs that illuminate the restaurant throughout.   Glenn our waiter was superb with every recommendation, swipe of removal of plates and every wine pour.   Next time will certainly try out the chocolate soufflé, sadly no room this trip!   Will surely return. 5/5."}
{"text":"We just went to this place for restaurant week. This was our last choice but because the other places were overbooked we decided to come here.. there was probably a reason it wasn't overbooked like the others... because it was horrible... the waiter was not very friendly and then after we were seated and had drinks we asked for the restaurant week menu (which was never offered to us) the waiter informed us most of the options of the restaurant week menu were unavailable.. basically they just had steak or beef cheeks no fish option... I don't eat red meat so obviously could not eat anything else ...I ordered an.onion soup that was inedible... so salty that out of respect for my kidneys I did not eat it and sent it back (first time I ever sent anything back in my life). Then I ordered the mussels... they tasted strange and fishy... i.am still praying that I don't get food poisoning, if I do I will update the review! I am so sad that we wasted our date night in this place... ugh .. even the lemon souffle was gross..."}
{"text":"Wanting traditional French Bistro food, we found ourselves here again. Our reservations were on a Saturday for a party of 3 at 7:30. The whole entire Kierland Commons area was bustling  including the restaurant. Our table was perfect, more toward the back in a corner so we were able to hear each other.  Our server Martin was fantastic, very friendly, informative, and service was right on par. We ordered drinks while looking over the menu. By the way they make a perfect Cosmo. For appetizer we ordered the Classic Creekstone Steak Tartare. Entrees ordered were the Classic Steak and Pomme Frites, Grilled Aged Duroc Pork Ribeye and the Dungness Crab Crepes, Tomato Lobster Cream. We finished the night with their famous Chocolate Souffle. All the food came out on time and was spaced evenly along with tasted great. No complaints at all!  Great service, great table location and great food! Perfect evening!"}
{"text":"The Zinc Bistro is definitely a place worth checking out.  Their grilled hanger steak served with greens, roasted red bell peppers, and blue cheese is sheer perfection!  The Valrhona chocolate soufflé with Grand Marnier sauce is worth the 20 min. wait but next time I'll order it ahead of time. How wonderful to have a place that makes a dessert on the spot!  The entire Zinc Bistro staff was very attentive and always ready to refill my drink, I couldn't be more pleased. The atmosphere is great, relaxed and fun.  My waiter, Glen, is one of the most profesional waiters I've encountered...in fact, I asked for his name again because I was so impressed with his manners and attentiveness without being intrusive while I enjoyed my lunch. The Zinc Bistro has met my every expectation!  Definitely will be returning.  I highly recommend their Scottsdale Kierland Commons location."}
{"text":"Had a great great boys night out with my 6yr old son. Our waiter Nick took great care of us. Whole staff was awesome. Zinc is always our goto place for relaxing and consistent meal."}
{"text":"Another spot I love & can't stay from!! A foodie's absolute delight! Modern, but classic French, with an occasional twist.  This is another place that my husband and I  frequent regularly, order something new every time and love every time. I adamantly never ate pork until I relented and tried the fig & espresso pork belly at zinc last year.  And I have to say I've seen the other side!! Amen, hallelujah!!  Pork belly is absolutely as heavenly as people make it up to be...  The scallops & chorizo are amazing, short ribs, sword fish, crab crepes, omg!!  Just order and you'll do fine!"}
{"text":"Normally have had great service & food here, but on Father's Day, Nicole H was simply horrible.  Rude, slow, non-helpful, etc.  Just a total fail.    A different food-deliverer brought out food and \"auctioned it off\" (didn't know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didn't bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didn't notice, so I had to bring it up to her.  Their bloody Mary's taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME.  The coq au vin was great.  WHY IS THERE NO \"CONTACT US\"/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????"}
{"text":"Our little crew was looking for a fun and different place to have a birthday lunch celebration. Zinc fit the bill perfectly. This french bistro is nestled in the center of Kierland Commons, well suited for a tasty shopping intermission. My two girlfriends and I each got something from a different section of the menu ( salad, sandwich, and entree) and shared a side of the mac and cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was superb. Our food came quickly and our server was friendly, funny, and helpful.   My recommends: The Basiled Chicken and Brie Sanwich Mac and Cheese  We were even treated to a nice Brandy Alexander in honor of my friends birthday.   Definitely worth many many visits in the future!"}
{"text":"My name is Ha, and I am a Francophile. I've been to France several times and know what a French bistro should be. This place looks the part: dark and romantic. It's not supposed to be so loud that you can't hear the people you're with. It was 9 pm and not very crowded. I had to yell across the table to be heard. On to the food part; just ok. I really just came for the soufflé and ended up getting mussels and Mac and cheese while I waited. The mussels were nothing to write home about, but the sauce was delicious. I used my bread to sop it all up. The soufflé was nothing fancy though; not worth the 30 minute wait. The mac was a side and overpriced at $9. Not impressed."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale for a few years now. Charming French atmosphere makes it an intimate dinner setting! Really interesting mix of ingredients that you won't find anywhere else.   A must-have: the truffle fries. They come w/ 3 different sauces, all to die for.   The prices make it more of a special occasion spot for me, but I would highly recommend Zinc Bistro. Well worth the cost. The wait staff is superb, and they are attentive even when the restaurant is packed."}
{"text":"We hopped down to this little French place after dinner at the Greene House to grab dessert. We had the chocolate soufflé and the pistachio tart. The tart was dense and rich, and the pistachio flavor was just strong enough to hold its own. Really well done. The soufflé was probably one of the best we've had. Light and fluffy inside, not under cooked inside, not burnt on top. Dark flavor. We were on a strict timeline and they even split the soufflé in half to speed up cooking. So grateful. We chose the chocolate sauce, but I'd like to return and try the Marion-berry sauce some time as well. We can't wait to come back and try the food - everyone's plates looked yummy."}
{"text":"Waitress super rude    All my friend did was ask to change her order (from a $16 app to the au poir) When we asked for the manager he was completely ignorant.   We Have been there Several times prior.  It was like they Were Trying to be rude for no reason.  II cannot believe all the good reviews here because I've heard many stories about how terrible they can be."}
{"text":"Fancy dinner, super rich, little salty and kinda pricey but I thouroughly enjoyed my food. Cozy patio. Loved the charcuterie."}
{"text":"Yummy mussels! Ask for Catherine or Alex- friendly, fast and attentive service! One of the managers is very friendly and greets guests coming in as well, named Glenn. Great wine selection and French food if you're feeling fancy. Patio & indoor seating."}
{"text":"Dinner last night had all the ingredients for misery if even one thing wasn't perfect.  The group I was with was full of picky eaters and loud complainers.  Zinc did everything right, service was amazing, and dinner was a huge success.  Put it this way - my son claimed his meal was \"Like the second coming of Christ\".  Uh - ok, at least he liked it!    Every item we ordered was amazing, from the flat iron steak to the chateaubriand for two to the lamb shank, from the chocolate souffle to even the green beans which turned out to be a hit, \"Mom, I would eat your green beans if they tasted like this.\"  Zinc is a great date spot, but is also good for older children because there's a good selection of \"normal\" food and staff are accommodating to kid-like requests such as sauce on the side."}
{"text":"A pleasant place in Kierland Center, but has gone down hill from earlier visit.  Good house wine by the carafe, we had the French Merlot.  Very inconsistent food quality.  I had the spinach and frisee salad.  The poached egg was overcooked, so no yolk to add the a very dry salad.  No enough bacon fat to wilt the salad properly.  An average quality lamb shank without any evidence of the olives and other seasonings promised.  My friends filet of beef was ordered medium rare and served med. well.  Rather dry.  They refused to subsitute for the brussels sprouts, then the waiter came back and said they could do it after all.  Desert souflles were ordered by two diners, both were dry and flavorless.  They need to pay more attention in the kitchen.  Overall, a very average experience at above average pricing."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is, quite simply, our favorite lunch restaurant in the area.  What makes it so?  Ambience - check.  Outstanding service - check.  Amazing menu - check.  Delicious, well-prepared food - check.  This is a place we take friends and family from out of the area.  Every one of them have been impressed.  Prices are reasonable, and they have a nice variety of wines by the glass.  On our last visit, my wife's curry chicken sandwich was prepared as a salad for her as she is cutting out most carbs.  My flat-iron steak salad was magnificent.  Even though the flat-iron steak is served cold, it had been cooked to a perfect medium-rare, just as I had specified.  What topped off the whole lunch experience was the service provided us by Nicole.  A personable, efficient, competent, and pleasant server, Nicole made us feel right at home and that we were, indeed, valued customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to ZB yesterday to have dinner and celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary.  As usual, the service was stellar and the food was perfection. I had the short ribs and my husband had the red snapper special. The waiter surprised us with the chocolate soufflé. Thank you for making our night so special. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious shaved chicken salad. Love this place for lunch and the lively scene. Thank you for whipping up some fresh whip cream for my doppio, service was the best!"}
{"text":"This is seriously good food in an atmosphere that is pretty hard to take seriously. Between all the Scottsdalians dressed in their finest D&G and Tommy Bahama and a decor that seems more Disney's version of a French bistro, I didn't have high hopes when entering the place. The wait staff further cemented the impression when two different waiters tried to wait on our table leaving us completely confused. They got it sorted out and the service improved from there. However, once the food came, I cast all doubts aside. The Man started with the foie gras first course while I had the ahi on rye. Both were outstanding. For our seconds I had the duck and he had the steak. The steak was nicely cooked, maybe a little too salty. The duck was a very large portion with intriguing complex flavors. Very good. We also had a great and reasonably priced Cotes du Rhone. I came in skeptical but I left impressed."}
{"text":"When they were in construction I was miffed that they were removing the glass walls and installing the new facade.  I'm a lover of modern architecture and thought they were destroying the original Kierland design.  But after eating here I understood that they wanted a classic French feel, so I forgave them about the windows and settled into many years of fine food.  Great place for a non-hurried meal, good wine and good prices.  Save room for dessert--pre-order the chocolate souffle, I like mine drizzled with chambord liqueur."}
{"text":"Loved the crab and truffle omelette. Was a little bad and got the truffle and Parmesan frites which were amazing. They come with three sauces and those were a great addition. Definitely will go again"}
{"text":"Excellent oysters and French onion soup! Highly recommended! We enjoyed the waiting staff and the upbeat atmosphere. This is a great date night restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was contemplating dining here versus another restaurant a block away. The other restaurant's prices were comparable, but served Californian cuisine. Having lived there a few years, I opted for the French style fare instead.   Shared a bottle of Wild Rock Pinot Noir, great value for the price. Tried the scallops, which were cooked perfectly. Shared some sides including the mac and cheese, asparagus, truffle fries and haricots verts. Can't remember what I had for dessert but do remember it was fudge-like.  Service was great. Atmosphere was cozy. It was a nice, slow European style meal. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was shopping at Kierland Commons when I stumbled upon Zinc Bistro. I was famished after doing some major damage shopping so I decided to stop in for a late dinner. Actually, I took notice Zinc as I was walking through the mall and coming upto it because of the music playing and the ambiance. I recognized the song being played was from the Hotel Costes collection (very French lounge/chill sounds)...so I was definitely going in.  I sat at the bar and the bartender immediately brought over the menu. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Steak Tartare. I've had this dish numerous times, but this one was flavored heavily with cornichon, which I was not a fan of. I felt bad returning it but the bartender quickly noticed I wasn't eating it after I had mentioned to him earlier I was famished. He offered to bring me something else and recommended the Crab & Mushroom Crepes w/Lobster Sauce. O-M-G...they were phenomenal. I was so pleased...I even scraped the lobster sauce leaving NOTHING on my plate. For dessert, the bartender recommended the Beignets and these came with 3 different dipping sauces (chocolate, grand marnier, and caramel/dulce de leche type). The beignets were lightly powdered with sugar and were very light and fluffy with a crunchy outside. Perfection!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here yesterday and it was delicious! I had the crab crepe and he had the basil chicken sandwich. We also shared an order of fries.   The food was great and so was the service! We would definitely go back. The only thing I wished was different was how they kind of crammed everyone who decided to sit inside together in the front. There was plenty of room to spread everyone out a little, however we still really liked it here!"}
{"text":"Food has gone down hill. Chared burgers, French onion soup had so much salt in it that such a.small bowl could not be finished by two people. The staff is good, water and drinks good. The food is terrible, was.not the Zinc I.once new. Save your appetite.for a place that when you order a.medium blue cheese burger they dont over cook and is.blue cheese that much.that all you can see is maybe a tablespoon. Wow what a joke. You make in and out burger look like gourmet cuisine. BRAVO"}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is one of my 'go to' restaurants for our family celebrations.  We seem to always go here for birthdays, holidays and anything else we are celebrating.  I think we do this because we love the place so much.  Chef Matt Carter has done such a tremendous job of providing a consistently outstanding menu.  Last night we enjoyed a family birthday dinner and had our usual wonderful experience.  My starter was the Spinach Frisée Salad (for me, sans Frisée).  Delicious.    My wife's entree was the Diver Scallops, Rock Shrimp, Corn and Chorizo Risotto...and it was perfectly prepared.  Mine was the Prime Flatiron Steak and again, perfect temperature, flavorful and delicious.  The brandy peppercorn sauce is so delicious that I always ask for a little extra.  We finished up with a Chocolate Soufflé with the Grand Marnier Sauce.  The rich, creamy, chocolate marnier sauce on the Soufflé was amazing.  Other items we have had here that are also phenomenal include the Onion Soup, the Pinot Braised Short Ribs, the Dungeness Crab Crepe and the Pate Maison.  Bottom line, you cannot go wrong at Zinc Bistro.  Also, a shout out to our regular waiter Frankie.  He has been there for years and is an absolute delight.  Frankie, you rock!"}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro is a must  if you visit Kirland Common, this restaurant is no stranger to awards and recognition.  Why I love it, Four and a half Stars, So close to Five.  I worked at Trio in Chicago and really enjoyed learning about French fine dinning.  Notice how many tables are served and how much detail is given to service and especially to each dish.  Most Fine dinning French restaurants are very small but Zink takes on an enormous challenge to satisfy each customer.  I really like the flat iorn steak and the wine selection is sure to please those who enjoy French wines.  I tend to order the Chateauneuf Du Pape.  Dessert, If you like chocolate order the Souffle and make sure you order it 1/2 before your ready."}
{"text":"Tried to grab a dessert with the fam (4 of us) at Zinc. Got denied by a rude Manager(?), who told the super cool hostess that we cannot tie up a table in the patio or courtyard if all we wanted was dessert. Bummer, the dessert was supposed to be a special treat for my daughter who just recovered from being in the ICU for a few days."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Zinc for dinner, but their lunch menu is amazing! They have a crispy duck sandwich that I absolutely crave sometimes. Their Zinc burger is also very good and the fries you can get compliment both meals very well.   I do enjoy the dinner menu as well. I would suggest ordering the iceberg salad which comes with bleu cheese and then adding crab to it. It might seem out there, but boy is it worth it."}
{"text":"This was for my boyfriends birthday. We are both foodies and we loved every minute of it.  The french onion soup and the short ribs were the best things I have every tasted.  Our waiter was amazing.  He really made us feel at home and gave us the best suggestions for ordering food and wine.  His name is Frankie C and he works Tues-Sat 4:30 - 10pm.  He made the experience so I highly suggest asking for him.  He brought my boyfriend a chocolate souffle that put his birthday cake to shame.  He really knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night during restaurant week. We had 8pm reservations on a Saturday but didn't ended up getting food until 9pm so be prepared if you come on Saturday night.  The waiter forgot about us for a while, when he went to check what desserts were still available for restaurant week, he came back like it was us that took forever to decide. Although he was nice and was able to substitute the preset apps for mussels since they were out of all but the onion soup. Same for the dessert.  Apps- Onion soup gratinee, traditional onion soup with bubbling gruyere Moules marinieres and frites- mussels  Entree- Crispy confit duck leg, flageolet bean cassoulet, smoked bing cherries, blistered  tomatoes, roasted hazelnut and pepita granola, olive bordelaise Braised Wagyu beef cheeks, grilled sweetbreads, roasted artichokes, mirepoix, candied  tomato, Jus de Viande Dessert- Rhubarb semifreddo, lemon poundcake croutons, vanilla bean and matcha tea anglaise, strawberry compote Creme Brulee The onion soup was such a disappointment, it smelled particular and not appetizing. It was too salty and the cheese just added to that; it had little to no onion flavor. The mussels were the highlight of the night. The broth was rich and flavorful and the mussels were fresh and cooked perfectly.  I would not classify the duck leg as crispy- I was hoping for peking duck crispy- it was separated from the fat but didn't have that satisfying crunch. It too was way too salty and hid any flavor of duck. The granola did give it the sweetness I craved for, but it still couldn't be saved. The beef cheeks were very tender, but the sauce was not to my tasting. The vegetables were the saving grace of the dish.  The desserts were good, the semifreddo was interesting and a refreshing end to the meal.  A good attempt, but not really worth the $100+ bill."}
{"text":"I suggest Zinc Bistro to any resident or visitor in Arizona. Located in the heart of Scottsdale, Zinc is placed in the center of the outdoor shopping mall Kierland. They have an outstanding staff that always pays attention to detail. Did I mention the atmosphere at Zinc? It is impeccable! Decorated as a café in Paris, it invited you to dine and enjoy a lovely fresh, French meal. Every time I go there it is hard for me to stray from the normal. That is one thing about Zinc that I love, it is always consistent with the flavor and taste of its food.  I usually start off with a sparkling pink lemonade that prepares my taste buds for a whirlwind of flavors. My mom and I often order the cheese plate to start, which never fails to amaze us. For my entrée, I usually order the basil brie chicken sandwich that is always cooked to perfection. The sauces warm, gooey consistency leaves your mouth watering for more. My mom usually orders the shaved chicken caesar salad, which never disappoints. We also place an order of the truffle fries, which are the greatest fries your taste buds will ever experience. Topped with fresh parmesan, the fries are cooked in truffle oil and served with a house made ketchup, thousand island, and mayo.  Needless to say, Zinc is definitely one of the top restaurants in Scottsdale. Whether you are out for a stroll through Kierland, or shopping for your graduation dress, there is no question you should stop at Zinc. Its service, quality of food, and ambiance are definitely worth experiencing! If you are in the area, Zinc is a must!"}
{"text":"Just saying it was delicious and a wonderful dining experience isn't enough. Zinc just does it all right. Our server Cara did a great job of explaining the menu and while attentive, she did not hover and allowed a relaxing experience. Dinner of flat iron steak and the crab omelet were perfectly prepared, a carafe of wine, and chocolate souffle for dessert. The bread was crisp and warm. We sat on the outdoor patio with other couples and business associates nearby but the atmosphere was quiet and pleasing. It is in the Kierland Mall among shops and apartments, yet you felt far away as if in a sidewalk cafe. This was our first visit but we will go back. We both saw a number of other menu items we would like to try."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Entire family enjoyed everything we had with special compliment to the Cajun project belly appetizer.  Staff took real pride in quality of food and made perfect suggestions."}
{"text":"I have never been a huge fan of French food, but my friend lived in France for 12 years and knew just what to order.  Everything we ate was right on and fantastic including the wine.  Spinach salad with poached egg, plate of cheese comes with bread, apples, nuts, jam and olives and the duck sandwich was just enough mixture with duck to not be to overly rich. My friend said the decor looked just like if you were in Paris.  We sat at the high-top next to the bar, light breeze coming in and great service from the bartender.  Sorry, cant remember his name, but he has been there a long time and is always friendly and not to mention eye-candy.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really do like Zinc, if I could find the time I would go more often! Great everything, just go!"}
{"text":"Great bread with French butter. The mussels (a bistro classic) are killer. I come here often and like to get the rotating fish special, I've yet to find anywhere in the Valley that does fish better.  My wife loves the filet topped with foie gras. The beignets with cream and berry sauces are amazing. Top both cappuccino, you can actually taste the espresso (illy). Service is great"}
{"text":"I went to Zinc last week for lunch.  I went for the mussels.  Their mussels can be spectacular.  They weren't on this occasion.  The broth, as usual, was superb.  The mussels, they had no flavor at all.  Tasteless.  What a disappointment.  My dining companion had the mac & cheese and the French onion soup.  The mac & cheese was very average tasting.  Like what I might expect at a local diner.  It should have been a $6 side not the $14 that it was.  The onion soup was equally unimpressive.  I lived in central Europe for several years, I know how good onion soup can be.  On a positive note, the butter was wonderful.  Zinc has this cultured butter that they serve with their bread that is exceptional.  Additionally, the service was excellent, as it always is."}
{"text":"We chose Zinc Bistro for Restaurant Week last month - lucky pick!  I was expecting a lot of snobbery, but the waitress was very polite, not condescending at all, and helpful. She brought me wine samples without me asking, which I've never had happen before.  We had the foie gras ravioli and one of the salads for starters; both were fantastic. Our entrees were the salmon and filet. Oh my God, they were both AMAZING. I could eat them both every day. The filet was melt in your mouth tender, and my salmon was bright pink and hot all the way through. I've never had such great salmon. The vegetables served with were delicious as well.  For dessert, the beignets (with blackberry and caramel sauce) and chocolate souffle were both divine. I mean, I am a chocoholic and I was scamming beignets off the boyfriend left and right, they were SO DARN GOOD with the sauces.   It was pretty pricey even with the restaurant week menu, but then we also had wine and cappucinos (the cappucino was even executed perfectly! Gah!)  Now, excuse me while I go dream about Zinc..."}
{"text":"Spent an extra long time walking around Phoenix airport looking for the best place to get lunch and settled on here since the menu sounded the most interesting.  I had the burger -- definitely nothing to write home about. The patty is large but not particularly flavorful. Toasted bun and fries are tasty but don't salvage this dish enough to recommend, especially for the price.  One friend also had the burger and was similarly disappointed, but another friend seemed to be satisfied with the chicken entree.  I wish I had spent less money at a faster establishment, and you may as well."}
{"text":"Delicious halibut special last evening.  Great taste and healthy dish.  Super service."}
{"text":"This has been a great spot that I frequented many times, up until today. Ordered the fresh seafood that tasted like it was still frozen. Oysters were okay but the quality of food does not merit the overly priced items. Service was great but the food was mediocre at best. Very disappointed as this place used to be a favorite spot but seems to have gone down hill."}
{"text":"Still great space.  Our waiter needed to have either brushed his teeth or chewed tic tacs. . My wife's salmon was a salt mine.  My spinach frisée salad had no dressing, no lardons, no frisée.  This used to be excellent at  $9 and is terrible ar$12.   The table next to us sent their entrees back as inedible. This chef has lost his way.  Living on laurels and over charging for less than average food. Also, I do not know why this is considered  a French Restaurant as there are no French staples except for the fries."}
{"text":"I love ZInc Bistro's enviornment. Its beautiful. I HATE the Service. And most of the food is meh. Be advised if you go in for just some espresso's with friends you will get  treated poorly by your server. They aren't very cheap either. I usually avoid going there mainly because I feel like punching the servers square in the face there."}
{"text":"I had a truly lovely lunch at zinc with a friend while shopping in the commons. I was blown away by the delicious cheese plate and have craved it ever since. The scallops were bright, beautiful and yummy. I especially loved the four older ladies lunching at the table next to me, all of whom had ordered the chicken curry salad sandwiches! I'll have to try that next time. I had excellent service, from the drinks to the desserts. If i lived closer, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I know it's sad to order a burger at a French Bistro, but I needed a snack. The burger was fantastic! Juicy and perfectly cooked medium. The iced tea was the best ever."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 8pm on a Thursday night and was surprised to see how lively it was. I was led to the back of the restaurant and sat at a table with a view of their grand Eiffel Tower replica that stood at the center of the restaurant. Ceilings were softly lit with red and white rounded hanging globes. So gorgeous!  The room screamed Paris and all I needed was the room to fill with cigarette smoke to feel like I was no longer at the scottsdale commons.   My server was extremely helpful. I went with the flat iron steak and matchstick potatoes. Huge!  But sooooo buttery delicious. The matchsticks were a little hard to eat at first but once I discovered that I can mash it down with my fork it was a potato party on my mouth. I had a great glass of Pinot noir (earthier of the two options offered) and was in a frenchy bliss as my mind bended 1) from my food coma 2) from the wine and 3) from the nostalgia of my own Paris adventures once upon a time.   Definitely recommend!  Would definitely come again if I visit scottsdale."}
{"text":"nice consistent casual french dining in  Kierland shopping ctr.  top picks: crab crepes, scallops and shrimp in a broth,rock shrimp salad, duck confit sandwich, fries, house wine by the glass or carafe.   Sit outside and people watch or they have a pretty cool courtyard patio when it gets hot but you want to be semi outdoors.  Just watch out if ordering the boullibasse  is different than most, no broth and has a paste on top which I did not expect but they gladly replaced."}
{"text":"This afternoon my wife and I were shopping at Kierland and we decided to pop into the Zinc Bistro for a cold glass of wine and some lunch.  To my shock, I was refused service inside of the restaurant because I was wearing a sleeveless shirt.  Not a tank top, but a $75 sleeveless Harley Davidson shirt.  I asked why women were allowed to dine with sleeveless shirts and tank tops, and I pointed to at least 8 women in the restaurant wearing such attire.  Even the hostess was wearing a tank top.  Hell, it's 101 degrees today, who wouldn't be wearing a sleeveless shirt!  I was told by the manager that this was a policy and the way that it has been for 14 years, that all men must have a shirt with sleeves.  That may be so, but based on state and federal law it is outright discrimination!  Yes, a business may have a policy, but it must be applied equally without regard to race, gender or sexual orientation!  I urge anyone who reads this NOT to dine at a zinc Bistro, a business that discriminates at will.  I was horribly embarrassed and was made to feel like a dog that had to be kept outside.  Just because it's been that way for 14 years does not make it right or acceptable.  What if female, racial and sexual equality had never changed??  Wake up Zinc Bistro and join the 21st century!!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Zinc today, we get there every year or so.  No problems - good, friendly service. Everything seemed well prepared and fresh."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my parents. Food was delicious like always. Mom had the mussels (loves them), Dad had the Lump Back Carb Meat Salad, and I had the Flat Iron Steak with Frites. Everything was great except for our server. It just seemed like she was too busy to pay attention to us. She is the reason for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Saturday nigh.  I had the steak au poivre.  Awesome!... absolutely delicious.  My wife had the chorizo scallop risotto.  Double awesome!  They were more scallop than risotto.  In fact, they were about as thick as a hockey puck and were done perfectly.  The creme brulee was outstanding for desert.  Service was great.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is outside my area of town so I frequent ZB only a couple of times a year.  That said, I've done this trip for a few years and in all my meals I've yet to be anything but pleased.  ZB gets a lot of things right.  You might notice that all the salt and pepper shakers are placed in the same location at every table or that the wait staff answers questions with clarity and professionalism.  Both are examples of the standard of excellence exhibited by the owner of this excellent establishment.  I've had most of the salads here and always opt for the pommes frites.  Truly excellent.  If you love chocolate (and who doesn't?) order the chocolate souffle with your entree.  It's decadent, gooey and absolutely delicious.  The gripe with ZB is that it's so popular some people are turned off by the wait, scottsdale crowd, etc.  Don't be.  Zinc is the best bistro in town and worthy of a visit.  I'm sure you'll come back for more."}
{"text":"I really like Zinc. The food has been excellent every time I have been here and the service has always been great. This is a great place to go on a Sunday afternoon to sip champagne and people watch.   The decor is awesome, looks very authentic, and they have a great patio that is perfect when the weather is nice.   The prices aren't anything out of the norm for this type of restaurant and considering it is in the middle of Kierland, it is fairly unpretentious, something I love about it.   One thing I have noticed, though, this would not be a vegetarian friendly restaurant. I am a bit of a picky eater when it comes to meat and sometimes I have trouble with the menu. But, that is with all French food, they like their meat. However, the staff has always been very accommodating to my eccentricities:) The onion soup is fabulous, by the way, and my friend loves their mussels, he gets them every time we go."}
{"text":"After several occassions of enjoying expensive wine on their patio, we were asked to leave after objecting to the blond Matre d's ecouragagement of smoking by females outside the restaurant doors. His attempt at flirting was more important to him than keeping customers and unfortunately we have many other fabulous options in the Kierland area for enjoying  dinner and wine."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  The ambiance is sooo pretty (I am obsessed with the huge, lighted Eiffel Tower in the center of the room...just trying to figure out how to sneak out with it), and service was excellent.  I came with 5 other gabby girlfriends for dinner at 7:30, and we chatted our way through apps, dinner, drinks, and beyond.  When the bills came, all were separated individually for us, and the server made sure to let us know that gratuity was already included.  Even with the disclaimer,  several girls tipped more than the allotted amount, and the manager came back to the table with the bills to verify a SECOND time that we knew gratuity was already included (I was WAY impressed with this).  What stellar service!  After the bills had been paid, we continued to chat for almost an hour before realizing that they had probably closed at least 30 minutes prior, and we were the last table in the restaurant.  No one said a word, or made us feel as though we needed to leave (which we did immediatly when we realized our faux pas), and in fact gave us a friendly farewell when we left.  I will say the place is pretty spendy (try about $28-$55 for an entree, and all ala carte), but worth it for special occasions, especially when the service is so great.  The menu was interesting and enticing, and everything I tried was delicious (INCLUDING the Mac N Cheese!!)  I will definitely be saving up some money to come back soon!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there for my B-day... Service was great... he helped us with the wine... Not to impress with the food... the asparagus were burn... the pate platter wasn't that good as it sound... Very romantic courtyard although it can get crazy depending who's seating next to your table... Not sure if I'll go back???"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner with some friends. I recommend sitting outside. The server was very pleasant, helpful and communicated well. The wine was very good. The food was good, nothing special about it. Overall we might go back, we might not. It was a good experience, but the prices are high so not a place you would go to often."}
{"text":"Great place to go, my favorite   Ask for Frankie the Server he is great.   Never had a bad meal...."}
{"text":"If you are snotty, you would like Zinc If you like high prices, you would like Zinc If you like lousy onion soup, you would like Zinc If you like snotty service, you would like Zinc If you like waiters with an attitude, you would like zinc  Drive a little further south, and go to \"Metro Brasserie\" - it will be well worth the extra time - and you won't regret it - or even better yet, go to France - they are even that rude there.  This negative review is a result of visiting Zinc on several occasions, over an extended period of time - only to find out that the service was still as bad or even worsened. Sorry, but until the restaurant improves quality across the board, and attitude drops - I am unable to recommend this restaurant at this time."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have done romantic dinners here as well as drinks and raw bar. Never disappointed.  They craft food... no stove slinging. If you want a romantic evening full of amazing food and lost time, eat in the hidden patio area. Their valentines  day  dinner has always been perfect. For happy hour or hang outs with friend, the sidewalk patio affords good people watching fodder along with the fabulous  food. Don't  forget  to save space for dessert. ... if they are serving their beignets.... do not miss!!!"}
{"text":"This reminds me nothing of the cafes I ate at while in Paris. Sadly, however, I wasn't in France, but Texas. Yes, Paris, Texas. My car broke down. I believe I had a cowboy omelet and a large ice tea while waiting for the repair. Here, at Zinc Bistro, I pretend I'm Paris, France. A glass of Burgundy with the French onion soup and some pomme frittes and I say WEE WEE! I've had good service here. Although I've seen larger tables having issues with flagging servers down. It's like they can't rememeber to ask for everything at once and the servers is doing some serious wind sprints from the kitchen to the table. The manager is way cool and always remembers me. I do love the bistro style atmosphere here and love hearing other peoples conversations when I dine a lone. I know. Shameful. But one couple was actually signing their divorce papers over a steak and a bottle of champagne."}
{"text":"BEST mac and cheese EVER.  BEST Pomme Frites EVER.  A place that gets a visit every time were in Scottsdale.  Always crowded, but great european atmosphere (and \"backyard\" patio seating).  Come for the excellent side dishes and a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! The worst Lemon Drop ever $12. The CHICKEN @ $26 was mushy, potatoes and celery were mushy.  The Beignets were also \"way\" mushy in the middle almost wet, ick! The chocolate leather around the \"tiny\" cheesecake was weird as in chocolate aspic with no flavor. The French atmosphere was very nice except for the Eiffel Tour in the middle of the restaurant lit up like a Christmas tree! To be fair, the sauces were very yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite French Bistro in the country. Great service, especially at the bar and the food is delicious. My favorite is the salad when I'm eating clean, and when I'm not, the frites are to die for and the chocolate soufflé is so decadent. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The truffle fries are delish. I also ate the flank steak salad. It was fresh and tender. We sat on the back patio and it was adorable. This was a great little lunch bistro."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the BEST French onion soup I've ever had!  Great service and the great ambiance made the evening effortlessly lovely. I will be going back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Another Food Network find....   Supposedly the best thing cheesy \"Chef Beau\" ever had was the onion soup from here..... In looking at Zinc it boasts some local awards for its French cuisine... I am on vacation sure why not.   Service Stellar. Frankie was super funny, polite and ensured we felt like we were his only table.   The food:  I did get the onion soup and it was good.Yes the crispy gruyere was yummy and the soup was good but not the best I have had....HOWEVER the scallops were probably the best I have had in a while. I got the scallops with black lentils and mustard cream... I give those two thumbs and a snap around the world. They were perfectly seared, sweet, buttery and huge. The lentils were firmer than I am used to but not unpleasant. The mustard cream was a perfect topper. We also got the parma/truffle fries were good. The fries were not greasy, crispy and the aiolis that accompanied them were a good complement. The curried chicken sandwich was well liked by my boyfriend. Other things ordered at our table: duck confit sandwich, chicken salad and house fries.    Overall: great place to grab some lunch, excellent service, don't believe the hype about the onion soup."}
{"text":"Zinc Bistro used to be my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Sadly, no longer.  I was there recently with two friends, and we had the WORST service I've every experienced.  It was clear they did not want our business.  I will not go into every gory detail of the really bad and condescending service - it seemed they were interested in serving only the under-30 age group, and I've got news for the owner: that group is not interested in a restaurant like Zinc!  The owner was rude to me once before when I told him I loved everything about his restaurant except the overly-loud music.  His reply was, \"I guess you won't be coming back here then.\"  Well, it took me awhile, but I finally got his point.  No more Zinc pommes frites pour MOI!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at the bar for early New Year's Eve drinks.  The four bartenders are without a doubt the best and most friendly in town.  Great guys with terrific customer service.  We love the atmosphere of Zinc Bistro - always good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience every time! The food is incredible and the service is exceptional! Highly recommend it. Try the Swordfish or the Scallops they are the best in town. ."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm and it was not that busy at all beautiful decor and a very romantic setting, For those who were complaining about the lighting they might want to get their eyes checked it was fine, The menu offered a number of tasty meals, I had a flat iron steak and my boyfriend has the roasted chicken with gnocchi it was amazing , We sampled some different wines and had a great waiter Frankie he was very good never let our glasses go empty and had lots of recommendations for us we can't wait to return again."}
{"text":"Reasonable lunch prices. Refreshing cocktails. Pretty good Croque Monsieur. I'd go again to try their dinner specials."}
{"text":"Changed my view after Dinner there.  Great Food, Mediocre Service, Excessive Prices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal. The food is just as good as it is in Paris. This bistro is adorable decorated and the food is absolutely delicious. I especially love getting lunch here. Make sure you get the French onion soup!"}
{"text":"Kind of disaapointed after our meal here last weekend.  I do have to say the service was excellent and that was the saving grace. I ordered the filet which had a very heavy sauce on it and it was charred. Was not expecting that.  The spinach salad wasn't that good and the oysters were okay but pretty small. No gluten free options for desert :/ Just don't think it is worth returning to."}
{"text":"This place is great all around with a strong representation of French cuisine with an adaptive flair."}
{"text":"Approaching ZB for a sunny February lunch I was struck by the crowd at the tables outside seemingly trying their upmost to convince themselves they were in St Tropez and not the Keirland Commons shopping mall. It was such a motley crue of Burberry wearing Benz drivers that it was quite an effort not to burst out laughing. Needless to say I asked for a table inside!  Greeted by a surly host we were shown to a table for two which in classic Bistro style was on the small side but it wasn't a busy Thursday so we had plenty of space. ZB has done a good job with the recreation of French bistro decor but you had the feeling it was more American French than French French. As if they had been to Bourdain's Les Halles in New York and tried their best to recreate the look and feel of his authentic bistro.   I ordered Moules Marieniere with stringier then usual shoestring fries (frankly they were so thin they were worthless). The mussels were tasty and the buttery white wine sauce has a nice kick to it and stood up well to bread dipping at the end of the meal. The mussels themselves were a little rubbery but if you order seafood in the desert I always think you have to be forgiving.  My fellow diner ordered a burger and the small taste I had was a delight, one of the best tasting burgers in some time and a nice lunch size, not huge so you wouldn't be weighed down for the rest of the day.  This was my second visit to ZB. Last time I ordered a really unimpressive Duck Confit sandwich and so I was hoping it would be a better experience all round this time, sadly not ... should a burger be the thing that impresses you most at a French bistro?  This joint is a classic example of having the look but not delivering the product. French bistro food should be fresh and simple but my second time here delivered just an 'OK' dining experience. Small things like the waitress pronouncing the 's' on Moules and the wine menu offering George DuBoeuf 'Morgan' when the wine is actually a 'Morgon'. If you are going to attempt French authenticity you should make sure the details are correct.  The final reason I won't be back was when I turned round and saw the same surly hostess taking her shoe off and rubbing her foot before putting it back on and handling menus.  Non merci."}
{"text":"Try the Mussels in the hot buttery sauce and then dip your bread in the leftover sauce... just amazing! Ive been here three or four times and it's still one of my favorites. Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars since our server was actually very good, but the food was kind of underwhelming for the prices for lunch, especially compared to the competition in Kierland commons. We had the duck confit sandwich and the bouillabaisse. The duck in the sandwich was cooked well but the sandwich felt very heavy, with the aioli and the foie grad just loaded on top, and accompanied by waffle potato chips, which just weren't good. They were not crisp and way too greasy - even if the chips had been the right crispness, a bit of greens would have worked better with this heavy sandwich. The bouillabaisse on the other hand was a bit more balanced, but on the salty side. The bread it came with didn't need any of the sauce since the soup alone was really good for dipping. I really wanted to like this place, but based on lunch, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really am a fan of this place. In a city full of restaurants and relatively high turnover, Zinc has proven its staying power. It can get crazy around lunch time (and the evening for that matter) but if you don't mind getting there soon after they open at 11 you won't need a reservation.   I've never had anything bad there but I can definitely recommend the grilled basil chicken sandwich. This thing is heaven on earth. Their burgers are also good with a really thick patty of beef and the tuna salad sandwich actually comes out as four miniature open-face sandwiches. Points for presentation and taste. Get an order of fries for the table. They are definitely worth the splurge.   If you have time to hang out, grab a stool at the big center table. Order some charcuterie and fromage, accompany it with some wine and enjoy the people watching."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place for lunch! The truffle fries and pesto chicken sandwich are to die for..."}
{"text":"good service.  food was ok.  soup was not good.  souffle was GREAT!  also had the ravioli w/ox tail (eh) and foie gras risotto was ok."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at zinc bistro at least 20 times, during the three out of the last six years I wasn't overseas, and only ever ordered the duck confit sandwich, because it is so exceptionally outstanding.   However, I try to get dinner there at least once a month, and have never been disappointed in the slightest.   Recently I've had rabbit there, and a lobster special that came with ravioli that were the shape and color to my sinicized eye, due to the superior quality of their wrappers and sauce they were served in, of dried stewed abalone. They weren't any less precious or savory.   It's a restaurant where it's hard to recommend one dish over another because of the uniform excellence, so have whatever appeals to you, and don't be afraid to try something new, because it will surprise you with just how good it is.  You will become convinced that it is one of the very best restaurants in the state.   They've got a tarte tatin, which is a sort of french apple cake-tart, served with cream that has just the slightest, most surprising and delicious hint of brie in it. So if I have to recommend something beside eating duck sandwiches there every chance you get, then I recommend that."}
{"text":"This is a good place to meet up for drinks and some appetizers. Small cozy place with a european feel."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the whole valley to eat! Every time I come I try something different and I'm always extremely pleased! The ambiance is amazing. Such a relaxing place. And the staff is AMAZING! All around amazing place for brunch, lunch, or dinner.  P.s.- the Bloody Mary's are sent from the heavens above. I'm SUPER picky with my Bloody Mary's and was in love with theirs."}
{"text":"I love this place!   My husband & I are born foodies, we found this gem accidentally.  The mussels are a must, everything is good and my favorite is the vast wine selection.  We eat here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"My wife has been trying to remember this wonderful little French bistro she ate at about six or seven years ago. Somehow we accidentally ran into it and we are so glad we did. The service is impeccable. The food is wonderful. Sitting outside on the patio with the misters going is such a treat. The fried chicken and gruyere sandwich is not to be missed. Try this place if you're in town. You won't be disappointed. Speaking of management and waitstaff, Jesse who has been here 13 years made us feel at home and everything he recommend was too notch. Thanks Jesse!"}
{"text":"Good food (but limited menu) & darling French atmosphere. I love the interior courtyard for peaceful outdoor seating. It's a bit over-priced for what you get though. $14 for cup (NOT a bowl) of French onion soup? Come on, now!"}
{"text":"I was there last night with my roommates. The mac n cheese was excellent as was the souffle desert. What was also incredible was the service. The waiting staff was incredible. I wasn't that hungry so I didn't get a full entree, but if I was it would have cost quite a bit. That's the only downside, you gotta have some serious cash to have a big dinner here. Luckily their food and service is well worth it."}
{"text":"The St-Germain Cocktail was perfect on a warm spring day in Phoenix. You can immediately tell the quality of ingredients here is superb. Enjoyed the wide selection of French menu options from Provencial Bouillabaisse to Gascon Duck confit and Burgandy Coq au Vin."}
{"text":"This is a Sex Kitten spot... meow.  Great wine select, just NO Pinot Syrah... so went with the Cab.  Waiters are responsive and your not left sitting around waiting to reorder and the location is purrrr'fect"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, well a little too dark... But my burn and dry steak were not worth the money or the Mac and cheese or my husbands fish, we will never be back, so pricy for something that we didn't really enjoy."}
{"text":"I adore the French culture and food, so therefore I like it already. Hehehe! =)  The first time I came here, I had ordered this seafood tartare.  One had foie gras, which is fatty Goose Liver! Sooo good, but can only have a bite size.  Came with a side of duck frites, just fancier fries, but not sure if they drizzle like duck grease or something.  Second time I had ordered a filet mignon with foie gras, was prepared well.  I also tried this crepe appetizer with lobster sauce! yum!  Very very nice French decor! They got a nice, cute little garden area deep inside the restaurant for outside seating to remind you of Paris.  Oh, they have a small scale Eiffel Tower to light up the interior space of the restaurant to add a nice touch! =)"}
{"text":"Really good food.  The designers actually succeeded making this look like an old Parisian bistro.  Once you are inside you can almost forget that you are in Scottsdale... at a mall.  Can't go wrong with a burger and fries here."}
