{"text":"The worst Chinese food I ever had in my 40yrs of my life time I'm sorry it took forty dollars to find out. The service is as horrid as the food. Please do not go there. I implore you."}
{"text":"It seems like a very simple restaurant. There was a couple dining in so that looked promising, although I've been there once before and the food was okay I'd never seen anyone dining in before. I order the Chow Mei Fun and two Spring Rolls did not get the sauce that is usually given with the Spring Rolls and did not miss it until I started to eat. The food was good but not much flavor it was just kinda bland. I will return again and try another dish and make a final decision then."}
{"text":"I ordered to go and when I got home there were bugs in my fried rice. The restaurant itself didn't seem particularly clean so I suppose it makes sense. Never again."}
{"text":"I am easily impressed by mediocre Chinese food.  This place isn't horrible but its not good either.  You get a lot of food per dollar and it comes out quick but it just doesn't seem even remotely fresh.  Honestly, I liked the Lo Mein, it was just that the sauce was overly salty.  The veggies were possibly frozen and the shrimp was just a bad idea on my part.  Its close, its cheap, and I like \"Chinese\" food.  But Lotus on Harris is only a couple miles away so that will stay as my local go to."}
{"text":"Lets get to the highlights, I ordered the beef and mixed vegetables and the general tso's chicken combos (with egg roll and white rice) and four egg rolls for my kiddos. Total was $21 and some change. Good price for how much food we got. The combos were HUGE and both were really good. I loved the general tso's sauce, it was unlike most other restaurants in the best way. The only downside was the egg rolls. :/ They were small and soggy and the tiny amount of filling was not flavorful in the least. I'd order from here again and skip the egg rolls in the future."}
{"text":"Pagoda is a good place to go to for Chinese food. Delicious meals, friendly staff. Restaurant is listed in a nice quiet area and food is always fresh."}
{"text":"It's great for last minute cravings. Good location near NorthLake. Food is not consistent. I've seen them change staff every few months. I have been eating here for two years. Large portions at reasonable prices. Best things are the Pork Friend Rice, Prok LoMein, Chicken and Broc, Hunan Chicken, Egg Drop soup, and Hot and Sour soups. The Wings are gigantic but always have white feathers on them. It freaks me out to remember what color the feathers were.   They are very friendly but their English is a bit limited. So be patient."}
{"text":"Being I am from New York City..raised in NYC where a Chinese restaurant is like almost on every block... I asked a co worker.. I want Chinese Food that is served from behind a bullet proof glass..'  They told me that this is where they go and the food is great.  NOPE!! ANY Chinese restaurant who SOAK it's rice in soy sauce..yep, it will taste like soy sauce. I ordered Shrimp friend rice with chicken wings with a $1 of extra shrimp. I got 7 pieces of shrimp..frustrated, didn't want to do the math on what I would have received without the one dollar extra shrimp. Chicken wings were good, I mean..how can you mess up chicken wings.  Here is the run down..entering and exiting this place. It was empty..on a Friday afternoon..go figure. The woman who took my order... Remember the Undertaker..his manager who carries that urn..the color of his face but he was in make up.. THIS woman's skin color was THIS color. I thought she was sick or was just bought back from the dead. I had second thoughts about ordering, but went ahead with my order. She was quick to point out that it was dinner menu time, not lunch..that hard up for selling higher priced items huh? Her attitude was nasty, like I was doing her a favor by ordering. My order came to about $20..no free soda, egg roll or soup offered. I mean WTF?  ONLY if this was the last remaining place on the face of the earth would I EVER eat at this place again."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. I ordered Orange chicken with Lo Mein over the phone. I wasn't expecting it to be a container of orange chicken and a small side of lo mein separate. It was enough chicken for 3-4 people. I also wanted to try their Crab Rangoon. It comes in an 8ct and the shell is super crunchy. At first I didn't mind the crunch, but then it became too much once i got to #3. I wanted to use the restroom when I first arrived, but I went ahead and paid for my food. The doors were open to the restrooms as if they had just cleaned them and were letting the floor dry. When I was about to walk into the women's the light was off. That didn't stop me from seeing the huge brown ring in the toilet. I know they don't cook the food in the restroom, but it makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like up close. The food was ok, but probably wont be back."}
{"text":"What are your expectations for Chinese fast food?  I've been going to Pagoda since they opened almost 8 years ago. I'm not sure why someone said their food is not consistent. To me, it's been consistently good for 8 years. But I don't get wings there. To me, that's not really Chinese food. But then again, what Americans call Chinese food really isn't Chinese food.  They do change staff about every few months. But they are all the same family. Daughters and/or sons go off to school or go do other things. Sometimes they come back. I've known the main cook in back for 8 years and he's always been there. The people that change are the ones you see behind the register, not the cooks.  English language is....good enough. But, yeah, if you have a special order or want something different, be patient, because they really do want to serve you well and will try to understand. It may just take a few extra minutes.  Portions are huge. House Special lo-mein is excellent and enough for two. Shrimp Egg Foo Young is very good. All the soups are good. Crispy Scallion Chicken is very good. Egg rolls are not chewy like you so often find in Chinese places. They are crisp and fresh.  Yes, it is Chinese fast food. Want perfect rice? Cook it at home and eat it immediately. But this is very good. There are a tremendous number of fast food places in this area, and I could go anywhere else. But I've been going here for 8 years and will continue to do so. I've never once been disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in today as I'm in the area... Yes it's cold out, but you wouldnt excpect to have to wear your jacket inside!   Only stayed due to time for my lunch.  Food is reasonable."}
{"text":"I was in the process of moving furniture to the house I was about to rent. I was starving. This was close by....so....I ordered Gen Tso, to be on the safe side. OMG that kitchen is so disgusting. I was starving, but I don't know why I followed through with the order. I tasted something like soured grease taste coming through the chicken and then some other rancid flavor. I lost my cookies. I couldn't hold this down. You know how you get food, and the smell is just wafting through the car, and gets the flavor buds going? Not this. I don't know what to say bc some people are saying they really like the food, but I honestly would rather dumpster dive for food than take a chance on this health violation. I mean that with all my heart, not as a joke. I'm with the other older reviewer. I'm 47 years old and this is positively the most disgusting food that has ever touched my lips."}
{"text":"Americanized Chinese Eats.  I placed a to go order and a big one at that. I was picking up for a few other office coworkers and they told us ten minutes. Kind of didn't believe that. But I pulled up and walked in ten minutes later and the food was hot and ready to go. They were pulling the last of our chicken wings off the fryer.  I was able to split up the payments for the orders no problem. And the food was well packed and still steaming hot when I got back to the office. They were very busy when I went and that definitely surprised me. I guess I just expected them to be a random hole in the wall spot that only a handful of people went to. I was wrong.  I ordered chicken wings and fried rice lunch special that came with an eggroll. The eggroll was filled with veggies and slightly greasy but with some duck sauce, it was decent for Americanized Chinese food. The fried rice was very basic fried rice, cooked with only soy sauce. I would pass on this if getting the lunch special again and probably go with French fries. The chicken wings were a pleasant surprise and very tasty.   If in the mood, I would definitely come to this place again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I was very impressed by Pagoda. I ordered the steamed chicken with broccoli combo. The portions are huge, and they provided ample broccoli and carrots. The chicken fried rice was tasty, and the whole meal was incredibly filling."}
