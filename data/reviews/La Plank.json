The service was kind and our orders arrived in a timely manner. The prices were more than reasonable and the food was on point. There are two outdoor eating terraces and indoor seating. 

Everyone at my table had a poutine and the gravy was one of the best I've ever had. The cheese curds were perfect; at the point where some were still squeaky but others were starting to melt under the gravy! It was the first poutine experience for one of my friends and he was happy the dish matched up to the high expectations preached by all the locals."}
