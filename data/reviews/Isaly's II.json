{"text":"Lived in the area for years and years and never knew this place was around.  They only do breakfast and lunch, and now they're closed on Sundays, which is a little odd.  A lot of people (like us) only get a chance to go out to breakfast on the weekends, so I'd think that that would cut into their business, but they seem to be doing fine, so what do I know?  Most days are \"seat yourself,\" so there's always interesting jockeying for position if there's a wait.  Counter seating is fun for kids to watch the goings-on in the open kitchen.    Never had any lunch items, but breakfast is always consistently good, and the servers are fast with a coffee refill.  As the previous review says, there's only one cook at the grill, so things can get a little slow sometimes.  Just chat with the people you came with or bring a book if you're solo."}
{"text":"Cool little place. Exactly what u expected. Cheap, good food and a cool small diner feel. If that's what your looking for this is a great spot"}
{"text":"This place probably had one of the best atmospheres and food of any of the many breakfast joints in town. I am an avid breakfast eater and this Isalys II has become a staple in our weekly lives."}
{"text":"Have your breakfast or lunch made by Stow's own Ron Swanson (aka owner Ed)! Trust me when you go you'll know what I mean. Never had to wait for a good breakfast here. The lunches are so-so but I've never been a fan of diner lunches anyway so I may be biased (I hear the soup is great). The service isn't overtly friendly but they're speedy and they've never made an error on my meals once in the many times I've come. Ed even made me a specially made turkey Reuben after giving me a hard time asking \"is it on the menu?\" It has a cute retro 50s look to it (although some things could use a good dusting) complete with diner counter and little bar stools. Overall a good, hot, cheap local breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place if you are in the mood for a classic breakfast. It is everything you want it to be - tasty, easy, delicious! This place is locally owned and the food is made by one guy at the grill so if they are busy it may take a couple extra minutes but it is so worth it. The hash browns are sooo good and crispy!! I will always eat at Isaly's!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years because of the service and prior bad experiences with the food not being prepared correctly. I went to meet a friend for breakfast. The scrambled eggs were very over cooked and like rubber. The hash browns had very little flavor and under seasoned."}
{"text":"Delicious, very reasonably priced food. Italy's II is tucked away in a back corner- we've driven by often but only this morning found it online. Our waiter was friendly & courteous. The owners are working alongside with a couple young people- not a hoitytoity place at all! We will definitely come back! The one drawback was the smell of glue that was very strong. This is because a new roof was being put on. It did NOT detract from a great tasting breakfast though!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years! This is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast and lunch! They have delicious soups, sandwiches, breakfast you name it. It is a good old fashioned diner. Breakfast is the best time to go in my opinion but you can get breakfast at anytime, which I love. They do not have a lot of seats so you might have to wait for a table but it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Perfect, tiny, little diner.  If you're looking for an old-school feel, and just simplicity in your life one morning, come on into here. They certainly have their regulars who are just a couple of older gentlemen that sit at the bar and order their \"usuals\" (usually black coffee and some toast). I think this place has pizazz. When I'm craving a good, cheap, old-fashioned breakfast and just want to quiet the craziness in my life, this is where I go. It has a 50's vibe, just because it's so laid-back and simple, which I love."}
{"text":"Tried to go there this morning as I keep on hearing about their breakfast.  Pulled in at 7:25. The sign says 7-2, the hours on this site says the same... but not a soul stirred in the darkened restaurant."}
{"text":"The greatest little restaurant in the area.  Great service always.  Food is always good.... and they do not skimp on the specials.  Great experience every time."}
