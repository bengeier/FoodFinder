{"text":"Never, ever again.   Let me start with the postitive: the Margherita pizza was good.  It's small, and expensive at over $11, but it was fresh.   Now the bad....I ordered the fish tacos. I took one bite and immediately knew something was wrong. They tasted like garbage smells...ugh!  It was one of the worst things ive ever had at a restaurant. I sent them back for the pizza. No apology from staff, no money off. Nothing.   We also ordered the big bang shrimp appetizer to split. The menu claims it's a \"generous portion\". At over $10 I expected more than 9 small shrimp on a plate!! I regretted it as soon as I saw it. It was decent but when an appetizer is $10, it should be enough to share. This wasn't.   My friend got the chicken Alfredo and thought it was ok. Severely underseasoned.   For the shrimp, pizza, and alfredo, our bill was $27.50 EACH with tax and tip!! With no alcohol or dessert!"}
{"text":"The Pizza, salads and burgers are fantastic. The staff is very professional and the owner is always there. Although I don't recommend taking your wife there for your anniversary this is a great restaurant for any other time."}
{"text":"Just ate the most incredible avocado bacon cheeseburger. Incredible. Definitely recommended and will come back again for it."}
{"text":"Stone Pepper's is the place we fall back on when we can't decide where to eat because we always have a good experience and go away satisfied.  They have a gluten free menu which meets my wife's needs.  Among the menu items we've tried, I would recommend the pizzas (pepperoni and Margherita), salads (apple-walnut chicken is my favorite), and the burgers.  I also like the seafood bisque."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this restaurant on our drive down Washington Rd between Pittsburgh and Washington. We arrived mid-afternoon, well after the lunch rush and were seated promptly.  We sat in the lounge area where there was 1 other table being served. Our waitress was really friendly and chatty and tried to help us figure out what we wanted. There is so much on the menu to choose from we needed a \"couple extra minutes\" at least twice.  There are several options for appetizers, stone oven pizzas, soups, sides, a gluten-free section, chopped salads,burgers, pasta, sandwiches & desserts.  I ended up getting the lettuce wraps off the appetizer menu since we weren't too far from dinner time. (see photo) The wraps were delicious. Chicken, water chestnuts, almonds, and celery in a soy sauce served with lettuce leaves. Yummy, but a little messy. So good.   My husband ordered the chicken quesadilla and said it was really tasty too.   We also had the spinach artichoke dip. As all spinach artichoke dip should be it was creamy and cheesy and very tasty. Served with multi colored tortilla chips.  Great place for lunch or dinner (I'm guessing, but would definitely try it for dinner)."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went here. We were completely disappointed with the service. We had to flag down the waiter for everything and when he came to the table it was like \"why are you bothering me\" we also had to wait an extra 15 minutes for the check after we were finished eating and another 8 minutes for him to bring it back for me to sign. The salad dressing was warm like it was sitting out since lunch and I couldn't even eat it. The crab cake could have been substituted with cardboard and I don't think I would have known. My wife's pasta was actually great so I just helped her eat it. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to Stone Peppers on a number of occasions and overall, the food an service have been good in the restaurant.  They have a large selection of pizzas, sandwiches and salads that all have fresh, quality ingredients, and it is a relaxed atmosphere.    My review would be better overall, but the bar has never been a good experience for me.  On one occasion, I went with a friend during a Penguins playoff game.  It was crowded, but not excessively so.  Since no tables at the bar were available and all the stools were taken, we stood near the bar and waited.  It was next to impossible to get any of the bartenders to respond to order drinks.  We ran into some other friends who were sitting at the bar and had requested more beers and had been waiting for 20 minutes for their drinks.  I had another similar experience when the bar was not crowded; the bartenders just seem to not be interested in serving customers.  In both cases it seemed like they were more interested in talking to their friends or flirting with regulars.    I'll go back for the restaurant, but never again for the bar."}
{"text":"As far as the food I'm usually satisfied however this place is missing quality staff. Either people seem like it's a hassel to wait on you or there's something just a little off about a few people there. I've only gone there a few times but rather take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cobb Salad Heaven!  This place has a great assortment of salads.  I am sure it is not good for me but what other way to get my vegetables in my diet!  I had something similar to fire cracker shrimp on my salad and it was quite good.   All the veges were fresh - no crazy rust spots on the lettuce.   The server was attentive.   The meal was quick and needed since it was during lunch.  The overall experience was really good.  I need to go back for a Happy Hour and see what it like.  Cost:  Salad - around $10 Service:  Awesome - quick and attentive Atmosphere:  Nice - I cannot wait for a Happy Hour there :-)  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My dad and I check this place out for dinner.  We ordered the chili shrimp, the \"full house\" pizza, and had the brownie/ice cream desert.  I often passed this place when driving on Route 19/Washington Road and wanted to check it out.    My experience in one word: underwhelmed.  The shrimp was ok, nothing that great especially for being marked as one of their well known items.  The pizza - blah, the sauce was too sweet and it tasted like a pizza chain pizza...what's all this about being baked in a brick stone oven, well I couldn't tell the difference.    I think the highlight of the meal was the brownie/ice cream...but really how can you get that wrong.  Take brownie, make warm, scoop vanilla ice cream, serve, enjoy.  Recommendation: keep driving."}
{"text":"I am a food snob who generally doesn't like American restaurants but I liked this place. The menu has a lot of options including burgers, pasta and pizza. Their burger selection is very similar to Red Robin because there are like 13 different types of burgers you can get here. The interior is pretty nice and the service was pretty good and friendly. I had a bleu cheese burger with fries. The fries were exceptional, but I realized that I am really burnt out on bleu cheese!  I will try this place again in the future.  Food Quality/Taste = 4 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Relative Price = 3 Stars Service = 4 Stars Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 3 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes"}
{"text":"Beyond mediocre... Sub-mediocre food, questionable cleanliness, non-motivated staff and apparently uncaring management that couldn't be bothered to make something right when she was told that a customer had a problem. Too busy hanging out in the empty wine bar with the two young, bored, male employees to actually help out the overwhelmed and untrained hostess, waitress, and frustrated bartender.  We won't be coming back, and hope that something better will take over the space some day."}
{"text":"Went at 7:30 on a Saturday and the wait was only 10 minutes tops.  Good prompt service.  Had the Pasta Jambalya. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Not just bad--weird, too.  We should've known that when the dining room was empty at 8:30pm on Black Friday--it was doomed to be bad. But we were a hungry family of 5 and stayed. We ordered some burgers and beer. When one on my daughters (21 years old) ordered a beer, she was asked for ID but since she did not have her license, my daughter asked for water. The waitress spent the next 40 minutes (our entire meal) watching us. The waitress was hiding and peeking around corners. It was so weird, it was funny.  Then when I offer my daughter a taste of my beer, a swat team pounced on us.  A manager stood at the table and tells us \"nobody without ID can have a sip of beer...\"  We were agreeable and moved on only to see staff gawk and gossip like they had caught major scofflaws.  I hope the Stone Pepper staff gets a major award for catching criminals but they are creepy and will not win customers.    The food was subpar, the atmosphere was perfect for a college sports team, and the staff was ridiculous.  I tried to give 0 stars, but apparently the minimum is 1."}
{"text":"This is your run-of-the-mill suburban chain restaurant. Friendly staff, nice outside deck when the weather is fine, nightly drink specials... but the food is... meh... at best. I usually get a salad and it is decent. This place is convenient and consistent and kid friendly so we eat here from time to time. Especially since there is a dearth of top notch restaurants in my 'hood. Don't go out of your way for this place."}
{"text":"You MUST TRY their pizza!!  Sooooo good!  I could eat this every single day and not get tired of it.  In fact, I wish I COULD eat this every single day.  Management, if you are reading this, please consider opening a location in the DC area.  I can pretty much guarantee that I would single-handedly keep you in business. ;-) Aside from the food, which is reason enough to make this a go-to staple whenever I'm in the area, the service was also excellent.  Our waitress was great.  I also like that they didn't keep their AC at ridiculous levels... I didn't have to wear a sweater over my outfit and sit on my hands to keep warm, which is usually the case at 95% of restaurants during the summer."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Patrick here that this place has a great assortment of salads.  Usually I would never think to order a salad, but after a non-impressive crab cake sandwich, I think next time I will try what my mother ordered: the Bang Bang Shrimp Salad.  It was absolutely phenomenal.  It definitely made the meal for all of us   The lettuce wraps were passable but nothing special, and my mother's Bisque soup was complete broth: it was terribly watered down.  When she said something to our waiter, he did not even offer a reason or a suggestion to get her another soup.  He just said, \"I will take that off your bill and tell the manager.\"  Well, the manager never came over to apologize or give a reason for the watery soup.  What really bummed me out was that the soup was what my mother had been bragging about and what she had been so excited for me to try.  Maybe we will have to try again someday."}
{"text":"After a long morning of house hunting, we were set on heading to Bado's, but the GPS wouldn't cooperate, so while driving aimlessly on Washington Road, we came upon a Stone Pepper's Grill location and decided to journey for sustenance no longer.  SPG is a local chain whose bill of fare is centered around burgers and brick oven pizza, with pasta, seafood, chicken, and beef entrees hanging around for diversity's sake.   Look, it's not that I'm unadventurous. I'm the kind of guy that'll order eel if I see it on a menu just because it's...weird. However, I am also a connoisseur of certain foods, namely burgers and pizza. Thus, I'm always searching for the perfect take; the ultimate patty or pie or whathaveyou.   I honestly couldn't decide, so I just went with their Bacon Avocado Burger, one of a baker's dozen of burgers that SPG offers.   Aaanndd...overall, it was merely a notch above serviceable. The bacon strips were plentiful and jutted out from between the buns like legs on a spider, so much so, my wild imagination allowed me to believe that it might leap from the plate and scamper across the table and onto the floor. I think the primary issue with this slab of ground Angus was that it was cooked well done when I ordered it medium rare. Bear in mind that I was asked by the server how I wanted it to be prepared. The bun was hearty enough, the cheese had a nice melt, the veggies (including dill pickle chips)  were fresh, and the 3 slices of avocado combined with the chipotle mayo was almost magic. The entire burger, while good enough, would have been magic had it been cooked to my specifications. He coulda been a contender...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKTsQoPTbVg  Their \"crispy fries\" were just that and more, coming off as beautifully battered (?) shafts o' tuber gold.   Our appetizer may have been the best part of our meal, The Maryland Crab Dip being a crock of tangy, milky, meaty (no skimping on crabmeat here), succulent mire that our finely toasted triangles of pita bread willfully wallowed in.   Once again, that quest to find the perfect take on something prevented me from ordering the Cinnamon Bun Pizza for dessert.   Indeed, they had a hot fudge brownie sundae on their menu, and I can't resist those because again, I want to find the very best one I can. This one would easily rank near the top. The brownie was flat, cut like a pie, and served as a luxurious platform for that union of frozen vanilla heaven and dark, luxurious hot fudge hell...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Yekv-onqE  There's just something about the juxtaposition of warmth and cold onto the palate.   SPG is a chain that doesn't feel or taste like a chain. Fool your friends!  I just hope they cook your meat the exact way you want it when you go, and you should.  P.S. Skipping breakfast, we ate at SPG around 2PM yesterday and haven't eaten again since. This was one filling meal."}
{"text":"We went for a Girls' Night Out, a party of 6.    Right away we noticed how unfriendly our waitress was, never smiled, didn't offer us specials, seemed like we were a bother to her.  We ordered appetizers, and they were really great - came out fast, very delicious.   When our entrees arrived, one person from our party didn't get hers, another was missing oil and vinegar for her salad, my chili was stone-cold. The waitress didn't come back for more than 10 minutes, to the point that one woman from our party went to find the manager.  He went to check on it and the waitress came back to ask if she'd ordered a half or full portion, but told us that it was made already.  Another almost 10 minutes later, she returned with the entree, but not the oil & vinegar.    We didn't see our waitress again for more than 1/2 hour.  She never came to check on drink refills or anything.  When we did find her and ask for our checks, two came back wrong.  The food was hit-or-miss, some was great, some average, but the service was horrible.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I have enjoyed several meals here in the past 3+ years, but the service I received tonight, will ensure that I will NEVER return.  I actually left before ordering due to the complete and utter lack of courtesy and respect my party received this evening.   One guest of our party was very late.  The wait staff was rude and quite disrespectful in our waiting process.  I caught the server complaining, although she failed to return to the table so we could order an appetizer.  My plastic cup had two different colors of lipstick on it, and the server never returned in 20 minutes to take an order nor address the dirty cup.  I left due to the lack of attentiveness and I lost trust they could/would be able to deliver an meal of quality, or the server would spit in my food.   The only reason I offer 2 stars is due to the previous number of meals that have been significantly better.  The stares was completely unnecessary.  The simple server would have benefited by a $10+ tip, just from me, but her negative attitude and rude behavior cause her to lose that plus the cost of an overpriced meal.  Sucks to be her!! Never again!!!"}
