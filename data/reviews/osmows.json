{"text":"It's very low grade sharama's and restaurant!prices seemed ok but I won't be back because u don't even get to watch or see what topping or sauces they put on ! SCARRY!!"}
{"text":"There is one guy that works here that totally ruins the experience. He's skinny, short, nervous, works the cash register, always wears the Osmow's baseball cap. He sucks. Has no idea what to do if you make the slightest, minor change. God forbid you ask for rice instead of fries, or an extra something for an added cost. He has no idea what to do, gets flustered and then ends up overcharging. He's also incredibly slow, he punches things into the computer like an infant. There's two other shawarma places in town that are overwhelmingly better. Bolton Osmows is absolutely horrible. Fire that guy.


UPDATE: I reluctantly came back, and to my surprise, the service has come a long way! New owners? I don't see our skinny friend anymore. Staff are seriously on top of things and know what they're selling and how to manipulate a standard menu item. Welcome back Osmow's!"}
{"text":"So, I've never been here... But I have to say..It wasnt at all what I expected. 

I got some type of half and half meal that had beef shwarma, ontop of fries and rice.

They put a greek sauce all over the meal. Its kind of like a comfort food Poutine in all honesty. 
The large was 14 bucks and it was WAY too much food for one person!

I had the beef and it was so tough and chewy. I was gonna huck it and be pissed and my wife said to get them to change it to chicken. Im not the type to do stuff like that. I rarely return food.  In this case she convinced me and the gentleman was apologetic and replaced it with chicken which was absolutely delicious. 

Great service, Great food."}
