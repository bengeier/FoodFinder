{"text":"I don't know why some gave this place bad reviews. I think the food is creative (and gets more creative every time I go) and very tasty. For reviewers who said the food was flavorless, I wonder what sort of restaurants they go to. Either that or my taste-buds are broken (or theirs are, so they need 5 times more spices than everyone else).  I think it's nice that the menu includes some fake meats. I gave up meat for different reasons, but I do like having fake meats once in a while, especially if I'm craving it. So even if those dishes aren't the most creative, it's a great thing to have for people who miss meat (or non-vegas/non-vegetarians).  I've had their lavender cake, fibbish and chips, various salads, soups, spaghetti/meatballs, and their \"random creations\" specials only for valentine's day. I liked everything I had.  I have NOT tried anything with vegan cheese yet. All vegan cheeses I've tried elsewhere taste like sour feet, so I'm hesitant on getting one of the dishes containing vegan cheese - mostly because it'll be a waste of the dish if I can finish it and because it's a little expensive. I'll try it one of these days though."}
{"text":"I came in nutrient-deficient, craving fruits and veggies. I've been back a couple of times and really enjoy their smoothies.  A couple reviews mention the smoothies are overpriced, but I think they're quite reasonable, given the high quality (real, fresh) ingredients -- if you want to save money, go to the local mega smoothie franchise and enjoy your blend of ice and artificial high-fructose concentrate something-or-other, but personally I'm glad places like this exist!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasure to have delicious vegetarian options in Urbana! I had the black bean and tempeh tacos with a quinoa corn side dish. Delish!"}
{"text":"Very good for vegans or people wanting to try vegan cuisine. The smoothies here are wonderful, me having a Blueberry Pineapple Love. Although it is a small restaurant, it is open, and has a lot of seating. The servers are all very prompt and energetic, giving good recommendations of meals. Lastly, for deserts I recommend the vanilla lavender cake for a sweet delicious taste."}
{"text":"After spending over a year researching vegan eats all over the east coast, I knew the thing I would miss most about NYC and Philly is the array of vegan dining options that central IL is severely lacking. Luckily, this Dog came dancing into my life and did more than soften the blow...  Specific favorite things about DD:  1.) Dessert: Ever heard of Vegan Treats in Bethlehem, PA? It was named one of the top 10 bakeries in the world. I can honestly say that after trying ~ 20 treats from there, I have had DD desserts that I've enjoyed more than many at VT. DD has new desserts every day, so it's my favorite part each visit to walk in and see what's on display. Some days have a better selection than others, so I wish the pastry department would expand to guarantee at least 2-3 cakes/cupcakes each day (always so moist and decadent). Some gems I've tried are GF vanilla lavender cake, \"ricotta\" cheesecake trifle, peanut butter fudge, and an oatmeal cream pie that would make Little Debbie abandon her reign and go veg for life.  2.) Lunch/Dinner options: I'm happy to see the menu is expanded, although I certainly don't have a problem with the kitchen continuing to experiment with even more options for me to try. (; Here are some highlights:  -- Soups. They have an actual soup wizard working for them. One Soup of the Day I was particularly impressed with a couple months ago, humbly titled \"mushroom\", was full of beautiful shiitakes, shining in a rich and silky umami broth of love. The chili is offered daily and it is also very tasty, hearty yet light and full of vegetables in addition to the beans.  -- Down & Dirty Dog.  This dog isn't made of random appendages from who knows how many species of animal. Nor is it the beige rubber stick that vegans have been begrudgingly choking down at bonfires for years. It's the best dog I've ever had. And the slaw and baked beans are even better, offering a hint of sweetness and a creamy crunch. There's also a pickle involved if you want even more crunch and tang, but I kind of liked eating the pickle separately because the slaw and beans are too good to be \"speared\" like that (ha).  -- Seitan Rueben. I've had other versions of this, including the famous Chicago Diner one, but DD's is special in its own right. I love that the seitan is made in-house because I know many vegan restaurants (even Vedge, the best vegan restaurant in the country) use seitan from outside sources. Plus DD's thousand island relish is crazy good.   -- Quinoa Scoop On A Bed. I once heard another customer tell a server the salad should be renamed to \"Mound of Goodness\". I wouldn't disagree. Mostly because of that tangy avocado dressing, but also because I when I want a salad, I want a legit sized bowl full of dark green and purple leaves, not a handful of lettuce with a tasteless tomato on top.   3.) The Veggs Bennedog for Sunday brunch. The Hollandaise sauce is insane. Who needs egg yolks ever? Even better with spinach!  4.) Staff: Everyone I've met here has been awesome; not just knowledgeable about the food but actually excited about it too (an unfortunate rarity in the food industry). I've even had a some interactions with the owners Linda and Brian (who are usually around - another sign of a great restaurant), and I can tell they are wonderful people who care about the food being served, and treat their employees well.  Overall, the Dancing Dog executes well what it has set out to be: a place where vegans and non-vegans can happily mingle with plenty of satisfying and tasty options, mostly reminiscent of traditional cafe/diner fare. They're still new and have a ton of potential to grow, which is exciting because they are off to an excellent start. This being said, the main suggestion I'd like to see more of in the future is fresh produce shining in more dishes.. Especially seasonal; it is winter so I'd love something like sweet potato gnocchi and roasted kabocha squash in sage brown butter sauce. (Also I hope real lemons are used in lemon cakes, not lemon extract, for example.)    (Final note, in response to a previous comment about using items from the vegan section of a grocery store... First, only a few menu items here even contain faux meats, certainly not the majority of the menu. And much like how non-veg restaurants do not construct chicken cutlets out of pantry ingredients and witchcraft, I'm guessing DD chooses certain faux meats because they cannot produce them in the kitchen. No, vegan restaurants do not NEED to use processed faux animal products, but the truth is that many vegans and non-vegans alike are intrigued by dishes that resemble childhood favorites, for instance, that we no longer eat because of the poor practices of the meat and dairy industries. Regardless, while 3-4 dishes on the menu use such \"meats\" as a component, the kitchen does their own seasoning/treatment to them, and all the accoutrements they are served with are house-made and delicious!)"}
{"text":"Food is good, vegetables fresh, place pleasant etc. But the prices are too high for what you get in return (amount-wise)."}
{"text":"love the dancing dog. Food is amazing, you don't even notice that your meal happens to be vegan! I love the sunshine salad and their house red wine :) don't shun this place because it's different than your usual palate, open your mind to some amazing food that makes you feel great!"}
{"text":"Desserts: fantastic taste, creative recipes, generous proportions.  Juice: tasty, fresh as can be, but overpriced.  Entrees: To put it simply, it's just fake-meat versions of bar food + salads.  Vegan cooking is so much more than that!  :(  I always feel gross and bloated after eating here... I stopped going after 5 visits (2 lunches, 3 dinners).  This food just makes me feel greasy and bad inside my body, and I am sorry, but I can cook better healthy vegan meals at home.  Don't try to compete with Crane Alley.  Instead, go deeper into the world of creative vegan cooking, please.  Staff: friendly, patient, helpful, seem genuinely happy to be there.  But every time I've gone (and this is consistent among at least 4 servers), I've noticed an air of awkward unsureness that's a bit unnecessary and annoying."}
{"text":"Short staff so my server rarely checked on my table. I ordered fries & never received it.. Turned out she never placed my order, server did not apologize. The food was not good. I will not return or recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed juices! Thank you for delivering healthy options. Nice cozy spot to get some lunch and work done."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Did i mention i love this place!? I literally dont have one bad thing to say about it! Wonderful food! Great service! Good atmosphere! And ALL VEGAN!!!!"}
{"text":"I have visited five times and each time the food and service has been wonderful. Linda and Brian do an amazingly creative job with vegan fare. The fruit is always ripe and the smoothies are divine. My favorite is the burrito - so good. Love the cole slaw. We had our company Holiday Party there in January and it was a big success with great appetizers and wine. The prices were very reasonable, and the atmosphere was great with candles on all of the tables and festive music. Such a welcome addition to Chambana."}
{"text":"I only write reviews after I have been to the business at least twice. This meets the bar because we liked it so much for dinner that we went back the next day for brunch.   Vegan deep dish pizza was freaking awesome. Just be sure to get a spicy topping for it (we got vegan sausage) because the base pizza alone needs a kick.   Allow extra time for the deep dish pizza because, like all deep dishes, they take at least 45 minutes to bake. Plenty of good appetizers to snack on while you wait!  The table service during dinner was terrible. Only one server for the entire restaurant. She apologized profusely and explained that someone hadn't shown up to work. The apology plus awesome food won them our sympathy. The next morning for brunch everyone scheduled to work was there and service was great.  Heavy brunch menu. Waffles. Biscuits and gravy. Tofu scramble. All were excellent! I'm glad we had hit the gym between dinner and brunch -- both were very filling meals.   Recommended. Go there!"}
{"text":"How is it fair that Urbana has a vegan restaurant, and all the way in Naperville I have to settle for my infrequent trips to the city in order to eat at a restaurant that actually serves food I'll eat???!!! Yes, I'm jealous!!  The menu here wasn't super extensive, but I actually really like that in a vegan restaurant. I spend less time agonizing over what to order, and more time looking forward to eating it. I got a seitan reuben, and it lived up to all of my expectations. I did think it was on the rather small side, but it was still filling, and came with a nice, heaping pile of fries. Yummmmm.  I guess I'll just have to be back to visit my good friend in Urbana more often and try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"After some incredibly disappointing food over the past few days, we stopped at the Dancing Dog on a long drive. We had a smoothie, fries, and tacos. The food was delicious and hit the spot. The only thing maybe not so great was the hummus (the bread was just too hard). The tacos were fabulous! Also, the woman checking us out was super friendly. We definitely will come back whenever we are near Urbana!"}
{"text":"DUDE.  So good.   We came in on our way back from Indiana, and on our way to the vet clinic at the U of I to pick up our sweet Abby's ashes (too much information? oh well).    When you've had so many black bean burgers you could barf, and so many salads that you're afraid you might turn into a head of lettuce, it's really nice to see a vegan place think outside the box and give you something else to choose from.  We came in for brunch on a Sunday and we were the only ones in there, but some people came in and grabbed a juice and left.  I guess it should also be taken into consideration that school's out for the summer, so I'm guessing they're busier during the school year.  I had biscuits and gravy with eggs and the husband had chicken and waffles.  Both were fantastic.  I fix fake chicken at home all the time, but they do it really well here.  The waffle was fluffy and chewy and wonderful and the cinnamon \"butter\" it came with was also awesome.  I wasn't quite as blown away by my biscuits and gravy, so I'll try something else next time or just get the chicken and waffles instead of eating off of my husband's plate the whole time.  Looking forward to trying the lavender cake next time too!  Overall, reasonable prices, good food, and no worries about accidentally eating meat.  It's a winner for me!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend who is a regular here. I am not vegan, but I love to try almost anything.   I really wanted to try the Fibbish and Chips, but they had run out. So, I ended up going with The Down and Dirty Dog with the quinoa and corn salad as my side. I also had a Pineapple Blueberry smoothie. Just drinking that smoothie made me feel healthier (technically one smoothie won't make you healthier, but that's besides the point).   I get my smoothie first and they had made it wrong, it tasted a little off and looked kind of not right in color, but I actually wasn't going to say anything. They knew though and had another made for me that looked much better when I got it.    Then, my food came. The quinoa and corn salad is very light. I like it, although I think if they use lemon at all in it, maybe a little more. The Down and Dirty Dog is delicious! The beans and slaw on it are the pièce de résistance. I love the slaw! :)   I decided that I might as well finish with a dessert since I was going to do a review. I was going to get a piece of their double chocolate cake, but someone literally ordered the rest of it before I was able to acquire a piece. Oh well, another time. I did however, get one of their big chocolate chip cookies. It has walnuts in it and I don't normally like walnuts in my chocolate chip cookies, but the walnuts added to the flavor and texture of the cookie. It was a little crispy on the edges and nice and soft otherwise.   It was a really good food experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"Sooo good!!! The  desserts are unreal and they're healthy!!! It's a must to stop by this local gem. Don't leave Urbana without doing so!"}
{"text":"Passing through and got to experience their Sunday brunch. The juices we ordered were the sweet  beet juice and it is wonderful! Also got the breakfast nachos which are more like potatoes and all the nacho toppings but it is absolutely out of this world! Friendly staff was really happy to find this place :-)"}
{"text":"Wait..... is this actually a vegan restaurant?!?   A quick glance at the menu and any carnivore would be fooled.   The options on the menu are not items most would typically think of being vegan but mmmmhmmm they sure taste everything but vegan.    I ordered the vegan Reuben sandwich with the salad and it was amazing! The food was prepared fast and that was great because it was kind of busy. I loved the slightly crisp taste on the bread and the texture and flavors all went great together.   I tried a bite of the grilled veggie and cheese sandwich, which was also vegan. Well everything is vegan at the restaurant and it was really tasty too. I liked the ketchup for the fries, it was a little sweet. But some Siracha would have been nice too, which unfortunately they don't have.   A lot of people came in and ordered cake and we didn't get any but they looked really good, especially the lavender flavor.   The area is really nice as well, there's art galleries, stores, and lots of restaurants. Lots of easy places to walk around too.   Highly recommend this restaurant to appease a vegan, but any foodie as well! Just don't tell them it's vegan they have ate all their food.   As always,  Go Vegan!"}
{"text":"Had the FIBBISH sandwich......very good. If you are non, or part time vegan...this is the way to go. Comes with choice of sides...we had the home cut French fries...also very good. Smoothies are good. And the salads were HUGE.....well worth a trip, and reasonable. Fibbish plate was around $7.00, but had nice huge portion, plus big tomato slice,and more. Love the serving sizes."}
{"text":"I must preface this review with the following: I am not a vegan or vegetarian. With that said - this is the most amazing food I have eaten in a long time! You must go. Now. I mean it - GO!   I have had their amazing Quinoa salad (twice), lavender vanilla cake (twice), Fibish sandwich, cheeze fries (OMG-how did they do that?), and something else equally amazing that I cannot remember because I'm thinking about their lavender vanilla cake right now and cursing that they are closed and I live out of town.   I'm almost contemplating giving them 1 star to keep them all to myself... but then they would go out of business, and I couldn't get their amazing food anymore."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times so far. First time we ordered the Reuben, Fibbish sandwich (both with fries), juices and a cheese plate starter. Second time the deep dish pizza, cheesy fries, sprouts and a vicken sandwich. Their sandwiches are delicious and really well done - I believe all the sauces are made by them and they're really good (garlic aoli, thousand island, tartar, ketchup etc.).   Onto the bad, the deep dish pizza was utterly disgusting. I simply don't understand the positive reviews for it.. It's filled with a jelly like cheese - super cornstarchy and gross looking with absolutely no cheesy flavor. This comes in huge chunks and honestly is like semi transparent frogspawn. I will say the tomato sauce and base of the pizza are pretty good.   The sides of brussel sprouts and the cheese plate were pretty good. The cheesy fries were ok but a bit drenched in a liquidy cheese.   Hey I'm not expecting the cheese to be exactly like real cheese, but I know there are good vegan substitutes out there and the cheese on the cheese plate was really good and delicious.  Overall it is a nice place to go, the juices are delicious and there's no where else in town to get a fresh juice. I would like to see them introduce a few vegan dishes that aren't just recreations of traditional american cuisine without animal produce. E.g. a buddha bowl, vegan curries.."}
{"text":"Love this place! On a road trip, I checked Happy Cow for a vegetarian restaurant for lunch. The food rocks! My husband and I tried the two soups and they were great. I had the sandwich special--roasted veggies, pesto, a nut cheese--and it was delish. Meat-loving hubby had the tacos and he couldn't believe how much he liked them. We were on a roll, so we got dessert too: a gigantic oatmeal & chocolate cookie and German chocolate cake. \"Try it, you'll love it.\""}
{"text":"The dancing dog. Don't let the name fool you, if your looking for high quality food to feed to your canine, you've found the place. However if your looking for a place to satisfy your hunger, keep searching."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is great. My boyfriend and I came down from Chicago to visit family and decided to check this place out.  We started with the hummus plate and the hummus tasted fresh and so were the veggies.  I got the dirty dog, which is a must-try. It is a veggie dog with baked beans, coleslaw and a pickle on top. Yum!!! My boyfriend got the tofu scramble burrito and it was delicious as well! We weren't expecting to find such an amazing vegan cafe in Urbana, everyone needs to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The pizza, fibbish & chips, and Reuben are unbelievable! And this is coming from non-vegans."}
{"text":"Vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free hotspot!  Try ANYTHING on the menu and your tastebuds will rejoice!  If you are looking for the versions of food you miss from your carnivorous days, this is the place: vegan chicken sandwich, vegan fish and chips, etc. You won't believe your mouth is munching vegan chow when you dig into these classic offerings.  The quinoa salad is great, but I like it better with extra dressing and avocado.  The nachos are fantastic and come in a serving that is actually large enough to share with my hungry, hungry husband! Bonus points for that.  Wine and beer available makes this a perfect spot for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in downtown Urbana.  I'll be back to this place many times!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and kosher guests! However, if you are new to being vegan or vegetarian, choose your meal wisely. My advice is to steer clear of the cheeze or replacement items if you are still new to vegan food and textures. Otherwise, this place can be awesome for non-vegans too :) There is a downstairs area where people can dine and an upstairs area that is more relaxed and chill. You can eat up here as well. The restaurant has a hip, laid-back vibe."}
{"text":"This place is very cultural and cozy. Just chilled and spend my entire afternoon there on Friday."}
{"text":"Everybody including the meat eaters were happy with what they got. Attention to detail, comfortable place. The desserts are worth planning a trip around , call ahead."}
{"text":"Great spot for vegans looking for a quick and excellent tasting meal. Casual attire and wonderful atmosphere. Parking is a little hard to figure out and there is usually a spot near a local restaurant or on the street. I look forward to visiting in the future."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I got the Pesto Grilled Cheeze and it was really delicious. I am not vegan so I was not used to the texture of the vegan cheese but it tasted similar to normal cheese. I also got the side house salad with my sandwich and it had this amazing dressing. I am dying to try their smoothies and juices and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is NOT an exaggeration... Worst experience EVER had due to a childish negligence of the recruited staff...   Every chef should be well aware at least of common allergies and take precautionary measures when preparing a meal. My girlfriend and I decided to add this restaurant into our lovely day. She got the sandwich she usually gets which has (ALMOND mozzarella) in it but since they were out, they decided to replace it with (CASHEW based cheese) which my girlfriend happens to be deadly allergic to, WITHOUT notifying us. My girlfriend immediately began to have a SEVERE allergic reaction and I had to race her home for her to take her medication in order to save her life..."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as I'm a vegetarian and this place is very conveniently located for me, and I like the vibe/atmosphere.  However, after eating there twice, I can say I found the food really disappointing.  I got their lentil soup and it was totally flavorless! I asked the waitress if they could add some more spice to it. She said okay but then didn't return for another 15 minutes. By then I had given up and just added salt to the bowl and ate it.  I also got one of their smoothies and was similarly unimpressed. I'm not sure why they are so expensive; I don't think they even use organic ingredients. Really surprised by what a high rating this restaurant is getting.  To me the food and smoothies severely lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Everything on the menu is great! Love the nachos! Everything on the menu is vegan which is a super plus for me. My favorite place to get a smoothie. The cake is great, the banana colada is one of my favorites as well as the lavender. Yumm! Prices are good, some think they are in the high side, but what do expect from a place that's vegan and healthy....you can also order on GrubHub too"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious!  I had the brussel sprouts and cleared the plate!  The black bean burger was seasoned well and not dry.  I am not vegan or vegetarian, but do enjoy vegetarian restaurants on occasion. This is on my list of places to dine when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great for our dairy-free family! Such a treat to be able to eat everything, this vegan restaurant knows how to appeal to omnivores' taste buds, too. Everything we had was delicious and reasonably priced. And top it all off with a PB&J cupcake for my dairy-allergic son (who never gets to have restaurant desserts), this was a real treat. We will stop in next time we're back in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I always find ourselves going back to Dancing Dog. The restaurant is tiny, but delicious. I like to eat healthy and don't eat meat a lot of the time and this restaurant is perfect to fulfill those needs.   Each dish I have ordered has been surprisingly tasty and I can't say I didn't like any of them. I've done the stew, the roasted red pepper soup (careful for allergies-made with cashews), and numerous of their salads, but my favorite being the sunshine.  We always grab juices as well while we are here, either stopping in and just picking up the juice or ordering it with our meals. They're very good, but could be filled to the top a little more considering the cup they are given in is tiny! The last time I went I took a cookie dough jar to go and it was by far one of the tastiest and not too over-the-top sugary treats I have tasted in awhile. I highly suggest visiting this restaurant if you're in the area. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Everything is off the charts.   Being plant based in Champaign is hard. Luckily Urbana has clutch spots like Dancing Dog with vegan options. DD is my #1 choice when I'm in the area.   If you could only eat here one time, make it on a Saturday and get a pizza. They're deep dish and super fresh. I'd def get extra marinara if that was an option.  At this point, I think I've tried everything on the menu and you can't really go wrong. Even their ketchup is notable.  Legitness."}
{"text":"The vanilla lavender cake tastes exactly like the weird cakes from Strawberry Fields :/. Dry, far too dense, overpowering amount of sugar, particularly the weird taste of powdered sugar. This didn't taste much like lavender. It tasted like a fudgy brick of flour and sugar and hard frosting. Exactly like the Strawberry Fields cakes. Cakes are supposed to be fluffy and airy and creamy. Not so at Dancing Dog. Also costs over $5 per slice... Totally does not make sense considering the taste.   Cole slaw tasted like coconut milk, which was a really off-putting flavor to have in this kind of dish. That is, a vegetable dish that is not supposed to make its substrate the star. The slaw was super watery too.   The spaghetti and meatballs was mostly pasta. Flavorless. What meatballs there were dry.   The reuben sandwich was the only acceptable part of this meal. I actually traded my spaghetti and meatballs dish for my friend's sandwich. If you ever find yourself here because you got lost on your way to a restaurant that serves good food, order this.   Everything was overpriced for the quality of the dishes as well as the portions. This is the worst vegan cooking I have ever encountered. They actually do worse than meat-centered restaurants at vegan cuisine.   Dancing Dog is one of those places where I would never come back of my own accord. Wow. I'm just blown away by how these foods passed the design stage. How... How..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and ordered The Tingler (with kale, beets, lemon, and ginger) along with the vegan lasagna (which came with a side salad).  The juice, lasagna, and salad were all excellent.  Portions seemed generous and fresh.  We also ordered the German chocolate cake and the frosting was delicious, but the cake itself was a little dry and had a sawdust texture.  Otherwise, it was decent.  Overall, however, this proved to be a better experience than my first time dining here, when it was becoming very chilly this past winter and I ordered a tempeh wrap thinking it would be a hot sandwich--only to have it arrive cold.  Not appetizing.  I hope they continue to experiment some more, and consider offering more rice or quinoa dishes that deviate from the expected (spaghetti, for example)."}
{"text":"So amazing to have a vegan restaurant in Urbana. Everything I have tried is delicious especially the scones!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear- part of the reason I marked this a half star lower than I would, is that it is relatively more expensive. That could be because of ingredient sourcing. Now for the food: lovely gluten-free almond cherry cake that's just about sweet enough to compensate for the lack of flour for us folks with regular digestion, and fresh, flavorful, balanced texture on that burger! I wiped off the coleslaw too. I plan to try the tacos and quinoa salad, and the seitan Reuben next! I have a feeling I'll be convinced to bump this up to 5 stars then.  UPDATE: Lovely tacos, but the quinoa salad did me in! The Reuben wasn't all I'd hoped it would be. But here's the thing that will have me become a regular customer- their shakes and juices- because I'm rarely so stocked with fruits & veggies that I'll have the 12 ingredients that go into one shake!"}
{"text":"The Dancing Dog has a nice lunch selection, and some good tasting beer to go with it. I especially liked the casual atmosphere and classic rock playing at just the right volume in the background. I will have to return for dessert ad that looks delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of vegan places in the area, certainly a gem in town. Good vegan food and awesome dessert!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for lunch one afternoon and I am so glad that we did! I was very excited to try an all-vegan menu. I enjoyed their broccoli soup, a fresh glass of orange juice, and the dancing dog nachos. Everything was great from service to taste. My orange juice and soup were exceptional!  The ambiance that afternoon was very calm and perfect for the two of us. I love the decor and the wait staff is very kind! I finished my meal with a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie - which was easily one of the best cookies I've ever had. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian restaurant in Urbana??!! What!?! It's actually a really awesome place. We started off with some nachos, which weren't anything too exceptional, but were good. I had their reuben with thousand island dressing. It was delightful. The \"meat\" had a great texture and the dressing added some tangy flavor to the sandwich. I also really liked their iced tea -- is that weird? It was a fun flavor. If you're down for some vegetarian adventures, I'd recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Reduced menu* but still fantastic. Tried the black bean burger ($11) which seems to have a hint of cumin or curry. The hand-cut fries were superb as usual. And because my appetite is perpetually vast, I had to have a slice of vanilla lavender cake ($5.50). It doesn't ever disappoint.  * So no tofu scramble unless you come in on a Sunday for their brunch menu. But their fries still satisfy my french fries fetish. Dessert is always good."}
{"text":"The food here is just okay. I cook vegan a lot at home, and am always surprised at how bland the food is at The Dancing Dog - with the exception of their vegan pizza. The menu is pretty uninspired and not too exciting, unfortunately. For me though, even if the food was stellar, I'd be hard pressed to return because the service is always awkward at best and passively hostile at worst. I've visited 4 times over the past year and always get treated like a nuisance. I've gone with my husband and with friends and each time we've all left feeling unwelcome. This kind of thing is what gives us herbivores a bad name."}
{"text":"A very nice vegan restaurant with nice calm interior. I have gotten variety of their juices, and they were some of the best I have ever had. One specific drink being The Reviver. I have tried their Garlic Vicken Sandwich and it was also very good. The only thing I can bring up other than the food and the atmosphere there is the prices, and they're high, and I don't expect anything less than that for vegan restaurants."}
{"text":"Super delicious. The French dip was waay too salty, but I appreciated the effort! The quinoa salad is a favorite, and juice is delicious. Love this place, love vegan food."}
{"text":"Excellent Eggs Benedict and DD Breakfast Burrito. Glad to see healthy alternatives for your traditional breakfast."}
{"text":"Really great experience my second time here. It seems they have worked out the kinks in the menu. Fish and Chips were excellent. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stumbled upon it and found fresh and creative smoothies, crunchy veggies, well seasoned soups, baked fries of high quality, friendly service, and a quaint environment. Need I say more?! This place is the real deal and I highly recommended it. I'll be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I have to revise my earlier statement. I would still give this a 4 stars because for the most part, I found everything to be very good. However, maybe the mixed reviews is because the food isn't made consistently every time. I had the tacos recently and there was much less flavor than there was i the past. So unless they changed the recipe, maybe the chef on that particular day didn't make it right."}
{"text":"Great ambience, it's a quirky restaurant that you can take out or dine in. Awesome juices and vegan dishes. Their soup of the day (veggie chili) was great and their tofu scrambled burrito was out of this world. It was so good we went back twice in 2 days!"}
{"text":"We shared buffalo cauliflower, the nachos ( with soy chorizo) and the Mediterranean salad. Everything was fresh and really delicious. We were so full but we managed to force ourselves to share a piece of the vanilla lavender cake. It was really hard to believe that that was vegan.. So incredibly good.. The atmosphere is very pleasant and service is very nice as well."}
{"text":"I don't know, I liked the food here but I was also somewhat let down because I hold vegetarian and vegan food to a higher standard than what they seem to serve here. The food here is alright but it has so much more potential to be great, and more flavorful, especially for such a price. I think they need to become more creative and up their standards here until they can be compared to the trendy vegetarian restaurants in Chicago."}
{"text":"The blonde server needs to be retrained or simply let go. Been there twice and she does no formalities of serving: doesn't ask for what you'd like to drink first or mention specials, just rushes into asking if you're ready to order off the menu. Second time we were there was a busy day, but when your food for just a 2 top takes 50 minutes, the server should update you and apologize rather than avoid your table. The table next to us spent their entire meal complaining about her rude attitude towards them, which we too witnessed. Positives are the food is great and flavorful, and a special kudos to the hostess(maybe manager) that handled a rush with class and kindness, helping out the servers when needed."}
{"text":"This adorable restaurant was colorful and cozy to dine in. The server was very friendly and helpful in describing menu items we wanted to try as first time diners. I highly recommend the cashew cheese plate, Reuben sandwich, and the pasta Alfredo! All excellent dishes! Their fries came with this really unique ketchup that was seasoned with spices and brought ketchup to a whole new level. They also have a quaint upstairs lounge where you can read, knit (yarn provided), and chat if you wish. You just have to bring your food upstairs since they don't have table service up there. Definitely will be coming back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended me this place. The Lasagna and chocolate cake with vanilla frosting both were great. Overall everyone loved whatever they tried. I have heard that Tingler is good too, although I haven't tasted that yet. Great place for vegan food, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I like how calming and casual this place is. And the food is great. I got this one type of carrot juice that I think about often."}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are alright for the price and the fact that it's a niche market. But the staff seems to be made entirely of people who have never worked in a restaurant and are trying to figure things out on their first day. The hosts are perpetually wandering around with confused looks, as if they can't remember which tables they were serving. They also seem to constantly swap tables with each other, which just seems to confuse them more. Back of house staff sometimes come to the front to set wet dishes on the counter, and the smoothie/ juice bar worker had apparently never considered the idea of prepping fruits before they were actually needed, thus eliminating the need to spend fifteen minutes chopping for every drink ordered. Would like to come back if I wasn't going to be irritated by incompetent staff."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm saying this upfront...I really liked the food a lot!!!!  BUT...we had a really long wait, 60+mins, and I'm not really sure why. Had to get it to go so we could get back for meetings.   So, overall it gets a lower rating only for that reason. Food and Juice would rate 4-5 stars.   The black bean burger and quinoa and corn salad was absolutely delicious. I also got the Chihuahua juice and will come back just for that.   There are several items I will eventually try, but will plan to not be on any time limit just in case next time. Maybe in a weekend so I can try a few of the possible adult beverage combinations...."}
{"text":"Very yummy and very friendly staff! Have been there for dinner and Sunday brunch. The chai snickerdoodle was huge and the best snickerdoodle I've ever had vegan or otherwise. It isn't cheap but it is yummy and fresh with a nice selection."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! If you are vegan and living anywhere in IL- I highly recommend taking a road trip to Urbana for this restaurant! My gf and I ordered 3 meals because we wanted it all! Their brunch was awesome! We had vicken and waffles, seitan hash and eggs benedict. They were all amazing!! And the coffee was great, too. Seriously, go here. It's so good!"}
{"text":"I've been back to Dancing Dog and I can say that they've greatly improved their menu! I had the burger which was satisfying and the service I experienced was great! The burger had a great taste and texture. The best thing was the \"goat cheese\" made from cashews. I will add that the food is still a bit expensive in my opinion but at least it seems like more of it is made in house!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Rude and slow. Glad I don't live in the area. Definitely won't be stopping on my way through town again. Waited 15mins for a smoothie that had 3 ingredients and there were 3 people eating. I guess they are college students who don't care."}
{"text":"I usually dis vegetarian food/ place, but this place is different. I had the quinoa on a bed, which was just like salad you would find anywhere - it was ok. However, my friend had the vegetarian chorizo, and it was awesome. It tastes just like meat!! I think the type of vegetarian meat that they serve changes every now and then. We also had the lavender cake for dessert. It was a little too sweet, but it's still yummy!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a weekend conference and was excited to check this place out on the Friday when I arrived. I stopped here for a quick snack before a (non-veg) dinner party. I ordered a half portion of nachos, which actually turned out to be a pretty generous helping. Not big enough to share, but it could work as a meal for a lot of folks I know. The nachos had lots of nice, fresh toppings, as well as satisfying gooey cheez.   It's too bad they're not open on Sunday afternoons/evenings, otherwise I would have come back to try more of their offerings. But the staff were super nice and helpful in recommending other veg-friendly places in the area that I could try for Sunday dinner.   Also, they get bonus points for the nineties playlist that they were rocking that night. Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, etc. I was especially entertained when the (presumably) college students next to me were reacting to Billy Corgan on Zero:   \"What *is* this?\" \"I don't know. But I kinda like it.\" \"Yeah, me too. It's kinda edgy.\"  Thanks, Dancing Dog, for educating the youths."}
{"text":"Who would have thought, that an amazing vegan restaurant would be nestled in the main street of Urbana, IL. I had not eaten all day and I was ready to chow down. Usually in situations like this, I think Mexican food. But my friend Issac said we have a cool vegan place 2 blocks from where you are playing you should check it out! Oh man Im so glad we did. I got this wonderful Peanut Butter thai veggie bowl with rice that had the most amazing flavor and totally hit the spot for a perfect dinner option!  The place was cool, you can order anything off the menu vegan, and they have amazing looking deserts! I went back the next morning to get coffee for the road and I loved how they had Soy Creamer (not just soy milk) for the coffee!  Really wonderful spot! I must stop of the highway next time I'm driving through to hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful vegan food! The tacos, quinoa salad, bruschetta and hummus are all delicious! The desserts; specifically the mousse was great. The wait staff was very friendly. Whether vegan or carnivore this place is a great spot."}
{"text":"So nice to finally have a place dedicated to cruelty-free and people with special diets. The nachos are amazing.  I hadn't had a Reuben in 5 years and finally had the vegan one which was awesome.  It's a great place for an intimate lunch or a dinner out. My husband took me there for Valentines Day this year and we left so happy. The desserts are amazing too."}
{"text":"I visited The Dancing Dog this evening, had an excellent meal, and the service was wonderful as well. The staff are very friendly, and everything on the menu (including the wine) is 100% vegan. I had the vegan fish and chips. I think the vegan fish pieces (there were three) are Sophie's Choice brand, and they are deep fried, so if you are looking for vegan health food, this might not be the dish for you. However, if you want the closest thing I've ever tasted to British-style fish and chips, this would be it. The tartar sauce was tasty and the coleslaw was some of the best I've had anywhere. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate chocolate chip, cookie, which was also excellent. Dense and chocolatey, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I will definitely visit here again the next time I'm in Urbana. Any vegans and vegetarians in town should feel lucky to have this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent. Since going vegan the thing I missed the most was a good, hearty sandwich. This place is my new go-to when I need a junk food fix. Would recommend to anyone looking for delicious plant based food."}
{"text":"Urbana has a vegan restaurant! Definitely a fan. Their desserts were GOOD; my favorite is the carrot cupcake! You must try it if you go! Their food is very tasty; however, I'm hoping in the future that they can expand their menu to include some creative vegan dishes that don't depend on fake-meat. There's a plethora of options available! Until then, I'm sure this will satisfy any vegan and NON-VEGAN's taste buds. :)"}
{"text":"So good! We got the garlic vicken sandwich and the soy chorizo tacos. Both were amazing! The tacos were very flavorful, had a strong taste of cumin and the vicken sandwich was super crispy and juicy. The bread they used for the vicken was amazing. Such a nice compliment! I asked for a side of vegan cheese to dip my fries. To me, the cheese was was the star of the meal. I poured it on everything.   We also got a slice of the carrot cake, which was the dessert of the day. Super moist and perfectly sweet, not over sweet. I was really blown away by our visit. They really know how to make food delicious!"}
{"text":"Driving thru and needed a lunch spot. This place did not disappoint! I had the classic burger and soup of the day. Soup could have used a little salt for my taste but otherwise the combo was pretty delicious. I also had the reviver juice which was tart and refreshing. The cafe is also super cute, great reclaimed wood floors/counter facade. I took the death by chocolate to go and I'm sure it will be as good as everything else! Staff was super friendly and food was fast. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy little spot with a great menu. It's not the cheapest option, but it's a worthwhile one. The \"chicken\" sandwich is one of my favorite things and their vanilla lavender cake is also pretty spectacular. Definitely a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"Best for lunch in Urbana. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE VEGAN TO LIKE IT. EVERYTHING IS SO YUMMY! You won't be able to tell you're eating vegan. Everything is made fresh from scratch. Service is fast and friendly."}
