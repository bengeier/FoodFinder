{"text":"This is a market/restaurant kind of deal, with a grill in the front and small aisles in the rear. The real attraction here, though, is their insanely good chicken pita. The meat is well-marinated and slow-cooked over wood coals. It takes a little longer to make than your average pita, but those with that extra little bit of patience will be greatly rewarded."}

{"text":"I live in San Diego..about as far away from Montreal as one can get.  However, I wanted to give props to the owner for offering free food to those that need it!   Everyone deserves to eat, no questions asked - that's the motto at Marché Restaurant Ferdous.  The restaurant on Ste. Catherine St. W offers free food to those who can't afford to pay for a meal.  \"People sometimes come here, you have no idea by their look that they need the food and they're shy or they don't believe in such things. So we told the cook, 'Don't ask any questions; do not judge them.' If they ask, just give them the food, that's it, that's all,\" said co-owner Yahya Hashemi.  The owners posted a sign months ago after noticing a number of homeless people in the area asking for spare change and in need of a warm meal  \"Especially when it's cold, they just want to eat,\" said Hashemi."}
{"text":"I stayed with no money like a week and I finish my last food I had .  Today went for asking free food , they gave me and I'm so so happy they did it . May Allah bless you and reward you ."}
{"text":"Great little spot near my university. I go there for lunch. Food is good and they are so kind and welcoming.   Good job on giving back to the poor. They give away free meals for people who can't afford to pay."}
{"text":"If I lived any closer, I would make a point of visiting your restaurant just on principal....thank you for your policy of providing meals to those who cannot afford them.  I'm impressed, and appreciate the values behind such a policy.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant that serves excellent Middle Eastern food, they have delicious chicken pita sandwiches with the chicken grilled on real charcoal, fresh sauces, fresh salads and all the food looks good and tastes better. It takes a bit of time to have the sandwiches made because they grill the chicken on the spot but the wait is worth the time. The service is friendly and courteous, so what;s not to like ?"}
{"text":"Marché Ferdous est un hybride entre une petite épicerie ethnique et un café--resto de style Moyen--Orient. La bouffe est super bonne, les assiettes sont généreuses et les prix sont plus que raisonnables pour le centre--ville. Il y a toujours un plat du jour, des sandwichs et des grillades. Les assiettes sont garnies de salade et de légumes marinés délicieux, sans compter la sauce! Bonne à s'en lécher les doigts! On peut manger sur place ou emporter. Le service est gentil et rapide. Un bon endroit pas cher pour casser la croûte dans le coin de l'université Concordia. Avis aux étudiants et aux curieux!"}
{"text":"Love this little joint for the facts that: 1/ They let ppl with no money eat for free, no questions asked. It's so kind and wonderful to see them giving back to the community 2/ The food is flavorful and is affordable 3/ The staff is nice and friendly I come here for lunch sometimes and if you bring your tupperware because you want to be eco-friendly, they'll accomodate and put the food in it for you :) I highly recommend it, for reasons mentioned above. We should definitely support them helping those in need while having yummy food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some live charcoal grilled kebabs laid into freshly wrapped pita bread with your choice of garlic sauce, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickled turnips and sliced pickles this is your place. They have a few choices of meat pitas for $3.99 plus tax (chicken, kebab and kofta). I asked the guy at the grill as it was my first time and he suggested kofta (which is a marinated minced meat). I was tightly rolled and the meat was well cooked. I enjoyed it walking down the street and wished I had another one to wash it down. The Market is filled with authentic Middle Eastern treats, dry goods, sweets and drinks. The sign out front mentions Halal. All in all a neat place."}
