{"text":"I was lucky enough to get to try this place at an event sponsored by 19North community group.  I'm not always that big a fan of Hawaiian food.  I think it can be a little bland, but that is definitely not the case hear.  We had the 2 option combo plate with coconut shrimp and pork. Tthe coconut shrimp which were perfectly fried and had a good taste and texture of coconut while not being overly sweet so the shrimp came through really nicely.  Chose the hot option for the sauce and really enjoyed the contrast of it with the hints of sweet from the coconut and shrimp.  Pork was solid - really tasty, well seasoned, and lots of earthy richness.  Nice contrasts on one plate with some good rice and killer side of kimchi cucumbers that were the perfect foil to the pork.  Since there were two of us we also took a shot on the Spam fries.  This is a good thing to share because it is really heavy duty.  Deep fried spam, bacon, sauce etc.  Definitely delicious.  The real topper with it is the obvious time and care put into cooking the elements and then composing them really nicely in a Spam can for serving.  I wish I had taken a pic because it was a nicer presentation than I have had at many excellent restaurants.   The topper of course is that their friends  - Happy Honu Shave Ice truck was there with them, but I will get them their own review soon enough!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time at the Food Truck West Friday night in Glendale at Sam's Club parking lot. I had the lobster tacos. For $12 I got 3 tacos which were very good."}
{"text":"Have had Flyin Hawaiian a couple of times now and tasted a few different things on the menu. Chicken teriyaki is bomb, pork katsu is too. Boyfriend has had the chicken katsu and the mahi tacos which were both great.  The plates come with rice and a choice of green salad, macaroni salad or chips. All very tasty with yummy sauces to boot. Theres also often an option to order a salad with any of the meats on top which I will be exploring next time. The specials change depending on the day but they will often post those ahead on Facebook.Great food and personable people. Also love that there is someone (friendly and helpful) up front to take your order face to face at an ordering table where you also pay, so you don't have to shout your order into someone's face through the food truck window like you might at other trucks."}
{"text":"I am always leery of food trucks... but holy Lord was this food delicious!!  Super friendly staff, and the flavors were amazing.  If you see their truck, GO ENJOY THEIR FOOD!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised on Oahu and constantly miss the food there. No need when this cart is around! \"Broke da mouth\" is the term to use for ono (delicious) food like this. Flyin' Hawaiian is LEGIT. Their sauces are off the chain, mac salad is just like home, their menu has plenty of options, and they aren't holding back on their portions. Don't miss out on trying this cart. Despite now being located in Portland with an abundance of food cart options, this is the best one I've ever been to."}
{"text":"They were at my office building today.  Nice Guys.  Had the Teriyaki Chicken   It was great !   Just like back in Hawaii.    Mahalo"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying these guys are totally professional.  They are friendly and worked with me to park their food truck outside of a tiki party I was helping with.  They arrived on time and were serving delicious food at reasonable prices the whole night.  So, about the food - holy Hawaiian,  it's tasty.  I had the Kahlua pig plate which was huge! I was stuck at a raffle table all night,  but person after person walked by with authentic Hawaiian food that smelled so good,  my mouth was watering.  I also made a point to ask people what they thought of The Flyin' Hawaiian; everyone mentioned how friendly they are and how on-point the food was. They have a fan for life in me.   If you like Hawaiian food,  like truly genuine mix plates, you won't regret stopping at their truck."}
{"text":"OMG the Pork Belly. This is the pork belly is what bacon wishes it could be. This is the kind of pork belly you dream about. Pork belly is not something everyone eats, their loss! If you have never tried it, this is a great introduction. Whenever the Nieces are with me (Haylie & Steph) we try to go on a food Adventure. Food Truck Friday is a great place for that. We tried several trucks and even though I had no room left in my stomach I could not help myself. It smelled so delicious. Now I get mistaken as the Rocks uglier cousin all the time. So I felt the Ohana. Everyone thinks I'm Hawaiian but I'm not and it's probably the best part about it cuz you get treated like family everywhere you go. This was no exception the customer service was amazing. She directed us in the right direction cuz we weren't sure what he wanted and she highly recommended pork belly. I was just lost in the flavors in the sweetness and the Char was perfect. The kids dug in had never had it before and also loved it. The mac salad was demolished along with the rice these kids never eat that stuff. Excellent all around experience would recommend and will see you soon again."}
{"text":"Food truck came to my apartment complex last night.  They offered Kahlua pork and mahi mahi tacos.  I chose the mahi mahi tacos ($11).  Received three, 5-inch tacos (bigger than traditional street tacos) packed to the gills with cabbage, pineapple, cilantro, and onions.  You could choose either a spicy or sweet sauce and I went for the sweet.  Man, those tacos were delicious.  The mahi mahi was cooked perfectly and the combination of the ingredients on top were fabulous.  My girlfriend also ordered the tacos and loved them as well. I was stuffed after eating two of the three tacos and took the last one home for lunch today (yay).  Definitely give this food truck a try."}
{"text":"Just got coconut shrimp and teriyaki steak on food truck Friday 83rd and Union Hills. Food is delicious and the owner was super helpful in what options he had to serve. Would recommend checking out what locations they will be at and trying out their food. I will be back for pork belly!"}
