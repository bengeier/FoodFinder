{"text":"Always friendly staff and fresh sushi grade seafood! Our whole office staff craves Poke Eats and wats there for lunch all the freakin time! Seriously if you love poke and want to give this Chandler spot a try, you'll have a new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ahi tuna, crab mix, avocado, Sweden's seeds, cucumber, sprouts, jalapeño, ginger, house sauce and Sriracha cream sauce poke-rito. Very fresh, very good. They let me sample the tuna and octopus first too! Will definitely be back to try the rice bowl and salad options."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Poke joints I have eaten at. Great price, great service and amazing food! The fish was fresh and flavorful. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great stuff. I'm hooked on poke. This place has what it takes. Fresh ingredients, good options, good service. If you haven't had poke yet, try this place."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Great food and staff were so friendly and eager to please!  Treat yourself to a delicious treat."}
{"text":"Want sushi but don't want to deal with slow unfriendly service? Go to Poke Eats! It's just like Chipotle except much, much better. Super friendly owner and staff. And most importantly their food is fresh and delicious. Highly recommend to those who live nearby.   Quick tip- there are variety of things you can do with their sauce. Let them know what you like (sweet, spicy, etc), they will hook you up."}
{"text":"Really great concept and execution . First off I was skeptical to eat at another trending Poké fast casual concept ...... but I had to try it since it just opened up so close to my dads house . We were so very pleasantly surprised , The fish tastes fresh the options for sauce and toppings are plentiful and you get the feeling that the owner know his way around this style of food . Easy to order easy to understand the menu you just have to now what sauces to use . Don't be timid mix and match a few ! Good job Poké eats I'll be back !"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have eaten here twice. The first time we both for Pokè-ritos and they were great. That was probably 4 months ago or so. Today was the second time and we both got pokè bowls. I'll save the details but within an hour of consuming the lunch we both were holed up in the bathroom dealing with some very unpleasant stomach issues. I can't pinpoint exactly what it was but that was the only thing we both ate today. The food was not nearly as fresh as competitors like Ahi Pokè where I eat frequently and have never had a problem."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. This was the first place that I've ever tried Poké and I now see what all the hype is about, this place was delicious! Definitely will be a regular visitor."}
{"text":"Best Poke place I've tried in the valley. Their sauces really set them above the rest"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and loved it! Restaurant was clean, staff was friendly and the food was delicious. So many different toppings to choose from! My hubby and I are looking forward to our next visit and trying a new poke bowl combination. Welcome to Chandler, see you again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I didn't know for sure if I would like it but he let me taste the Hawaiian tuna and the spicy tuna. It was great!"}
{"text":"Got the half spring mix and half brown rice base.  They had 6+ kinds of proteins, I got the spicy tuna and a special ahi style.  And you get a scoop of crab mix.  Everything was delicious .  I'll be going back!!"}
{"text":"Very good poke! This was my first time here and since it was my lunch break i needed something fast.  The food was fresh and delish and the staff was very friendly . Now the food is a little spendy but worth it. I would definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Great food. Ahi and salmon were fantastic.  Very clean. Friendly staff. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this was the place I went to try poke for the first time. It was so good! Everything was so fresh and healthy you just feel good eating it!"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. The gal who helped me knew how to make a bowl. I said heavy everything. She didn't just put a squirt of sauce. She drizzled that shiz all over! Everything was fresh and delicious. Best bowl I've had in the area. The other employees were very nice and had good energy. When I encounter things like this I always tip extra.  Will definitely be back here once a week."}
{"text":"First Off I love Poke, I'm a poke fanatic, but not all poke joints are the same and not all deliver. This place delivers.  Poke Eats is solid, they have good fresh ingredients, good combinations and toppings, good fish, and I like their options. You can get a sushi burrito, you can have a classic white rice bowl, you can have a brown rice bowl, whatever you want. I also really like that they have sliced mango and good crab meat, everything comes together very tasty and best of all the portions are right!  I cant stand when people skimp and give you tiny little bowls like they do at Poketrition, I never feel satisfied there, but this place gives you a good helping and you will leave satisfied.  The service is really family oriented and friendly too, you're greeted and treated well, it's a family run place and their attitude and work ethic is great, all class.  It's about time we had a good poke place in south chandler, it's close to everything and anyone looking for a great healthy lunch hour bite or one tasty poke dinner should come here.  Cheers to many more visits"}
{"text":"It was a good fast food poke place; it was better than other competitors in the valley."}
{"text":"Honestly speaking, @poke_eats is probably at the top of my list for poke in AZ now. I was pretty satisfied with the portion size. As you can tell, the bowls are generously filled. The food was also very fresh which is important cause you know, raw fish I also liked how there were a large variety of fish and toppings to choose from. They even had mango which is awesome cause I only know two places that have it. I believe the other place is @pokitrition? Oh, and I think this was actually my first time seeing a poke shop have Yellowtail available, at least in AZ so yeah. You should try it! If not, you can also go to @ahipokibowl cause it's fairly similar"}
{"text":"Overpriced and no ambience at all. The flavor of the poke was good but way too little of it. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Great spot. Delicious, healthy portions, really clean, and friendly staff. Definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Bring your wallet because they will nickel and dime you to death. Portions are very small. Very disappointed for a meal that's $9:00 ended up paying $13:00 for \"Extra dollar\". When getting additional items besides Poké. Many of these types around that much much better."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Poké in town. You can taste the freshness, serving size is plentiful. Each time I've been in the staff has been friendly and nice. One time one of the business partners served me, he was friendly and pleasant. Fresh brew ice tea is also great! -the last time I went it was quiet maybe turn on the music a little louder :)"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! Well then, AMAZING, healthy & extremly fresh . This is the best place we have been to in a long time! The staff is extremly welcoming and knowledgeable. The owner Billy is very nice and knows his stuff. We will be customers for life! I wish I could give a million stars but for now I give a million thanks for opening this amazing place!  Highly recommend, the prices are great, very clean and fun atmosphere. See y'all soon."}
{"text":"I got a 2 scoop bowl with rice, salmon tuna WASABI Cream, both crabs (+1) extra masago, seaweed 3 ways, radishes, daikon sprouts masago and cucumber.   The employees were super nice. The ingredients were very fresh and the portions were great. So glad to have a poke place closer to home! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Lots of options to come up with your own Poke creation."}
{"text":"The food was delicious here. The servings are HUGE and the owner is a great guy. Anytime I see owners really engaging with customers, it makes me want to support them more. I went the tofu & shrimp route and the hubby got spicy tuna and another fish. I love the variety that is offered in these massive bowls. It's like a MASSIVE sushi roll unloaded. I loved my bowl with unagi and sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"Fantastic new place. Great staff.  Healthy and affordable.  Why there isn't a line out the door amazes me."}
{"text":"With the many poke places popping up all around the valley, there are few that makes me go \"eh\". But poke eats is quite good with their nicely wrapped \"sushi burritos\".  The selection is on par with others and good flavor and nice fish."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the poke bowl here. Ingredients are fresh, portions were good on the three item. Marinated ahi, salmon and octopus on half and half white rice and salad. Sauces were great, love that they have Wasabi cream sauce. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super nice crew and really yummy Poke! :) recommend to anyone looking for some fresh healthy eats!"}
{"text":"I am so glad Poke Eats joined the neighborhood. They have some of the best poke I've had. The veggies are fresh and crisp, and the fish tastes high quality and delicious. They also have a big sauce variety. I love the creamy wasabi and creamy Sriracha. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Best poke in Chandler. I've tried Pokitrition and Ahi Poke - Poke Eats beats them in freshness and portion size."}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up a bite to go. Interior was clean and comfortable. It was my first visit so I had some questions and the friendly staff was helpful. I picked my base, protein, and veggies then I was out in no time. Spicy Ponzu sauce was mild on the heat but very tasty. Overall the bowl was good. I would like to see some chef recommendations or maybe a recipe or two for ideas on different flavor profiles as there are a lot of possible combinations. A good experience I will be back."}
{"text":"I started eating poke in NYC 3 years ago. This place is as good and around the corner! Lucky me. I love the added noodle option. Great mix! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean, when I walked in there wasn't t an overwhelming fish smell.  The portion size was really nice for me.  I opted for ahi and Hawaiian ahi, both were cut nicely and fresh.  There was a large variety of toppings and sauces.  Actually after reading reviews that's what brought me in and I was not disappointed!  I did opt for avocado add on but I found I was at the end of my bowl and hadn't eaten it yet.  The fresh flavors and the wasabi cream sauce were so good, I think avocado creaminess was overkill... my fault I never turn down avocado lol.  The staff were very friendly with smiles on, which makes all the difference when dining out regardless of price point.    I added on a drink and avocado, so my order was about $15.  Seriously the ahi at this location is competitive with RA's Sashimi.  There were a dozen or so people who came in when  I did about 2 pm, I think more people got bowls than burritos (avocado is a must in burritos).  I definitely recommend for eat in or take away."}
{"text":"Went during soft opening. Very helpful staff, food all fresh and delicious. Had them add extra sriracha mayo to my rice before the toppings, but that's just how I roll. Got tuna and shrimp. Both tasty, fresh. I tried 2 pieces of tofu (on the house!), and I think it will be my new fav. Hope this place succeeds; great alternative to sushi."}
{"text":"It's not very good. It lacked flavor and depth. While the poke itself is mediocre they did provide ample toppings. Sadly I don't think my family and I will be returning"}
{"text":"The poke burritos are amazing.  Big portions and very fresh.  The service is always extremely friendly and helpful .  So glad this is a neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff are incredibly welcoming and delightful. The food is high quality and as fresh as it gets. The food is ready pretty much as soon as you order it so it's a great place to get something quick and tasty but if you have time to dine in its a nice place to eat with friends or chat with the staff while enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Much better than AhiPoki! Crab meat and seaweed are free! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm having a white rice bowl with yellowtail and octopus, topoed off with crabmix, ginger, edamame, seaweed (2 kinds), the Spicy Ponzu, topped with Nori and a little Unagi sauce. Feels like Im getting a salad AND having sashimi.  Win Win!  Cannot wait to try something different here.  Gluten free is easy here. Added bonus was the 30% off. Don't be pokey or you'll miss all this goodness."}
{"text":"This is a great poke place! The portion is large with big pieces of fish, and employees are always generous with sauce and toppings. My favorite sauce combo is sriracha cream and spicy ponzu. You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Hesitant to try to place because I have a favorite local Poké place. But my son was hungry and wanted to just eat here. Fish selection was good and tasted fresh. Except they charge for everything and fish servings is smaller than my favorite place. We will be back because my son loves their ahi tuna!"}
{"text":"For years I have heard of sushi burritos and eagerly waited the day I could try one. I live nearby this place so I popped in randomly craving a poke bowl. Their bowls are great and they have a bunch of toppings and sauces to add. I love the bowls because you can get salad with it so it makes it feel healthier haha. But halfway through adding everything humanly possible I realized they have Poké-ritos which already solidified me coming back another time. I now eat here at least once a week. Their food is great quality, fresh, and delicious. The staff is super nice and helpful (I have celiacs disease and they have gluten free soy sauce available!) if you haven't tried it yet you have to go now! They also have stamp cards so you get your 9th bowl or burrito free!"}
{"text":"Yummy goodness! Ordered the spring salad with Hawaiian poke and spicy crab with the fixins. If you're not a fan of raw fish then I wouldn't recommend, but being from HI, missing local eats this is one to try. Little pricey but to be expected with Ahi. Worth every penny. Will definitely be back. Finally one in Ocotillo!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Poke place in the East Valley. I love the atmosphere as I walk in, cleanliness, friendliness of the staff and all of the options offered for fish, and alternative proteins (chicken and tofu anybody?).   They offer bowls as well as burritos. My only wish was they had yellowtail (maybe they usually do but not on the day I went). Poke Eats has the largest selection of fish and toppings around, even compared to Ahi Poke Bowl.  I could eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"The fish was incredibly fresh, the establishment is clean and everything was full of flavor and delicious. The fish was so yummy it felt like I was eating poke right in Hawaii. Will most definitely be going back, and recommending to people."}
{"text":"Good poke spot! I am usually going to another poke place but I was in the neighborhood today and decided to give it a chance  Not disappointed. Fresh. Flavorful. I love the topping selection.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Back again. The only suggestion I have for this place is that they use a salad spinner so the lettuce isn't so wet.   But the Hawaiian Tuna is my absolute fave!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean decor, and flavourful Poké. Highly recommended. Would definitely make the trip back."}
{"text":"Billy is a super nice guy and this place is really good. I'm glad one opened up right in this neighborhood so I no longer have to drive 5 miles out of my way.  The only thing I wish that they would add in is furikakae I believe it's called. It's a spicy flake that goes on top of your food. Very good"}
{"text":"Typical Poke bowl restaurant. Food was good. Place was clean and staff was fine but not particularly engaged with patrons."}
{"text":"If you love or want to try poké definitely go to Poké Eats. Since I started my sushi burrito obsession in Portland, I've been wanting to try every place that has them. This place has the freshest ingredients, more options than other places and they are very generous with their portions at a very reasonable price. When it comes to this type of food, it is hard to feel full and not end up with a hefty bill afterwards so definitely a win!  Aside from their food, their customer service is on point. The first time I came here was with my family during their Grand Opening. They were doing 30% off and the owners were very friendly and engaged with the customers. We got to talking to one of them and he ended up giving us a stack of 30% off coupons for future use. They really care about their customers and value their feedback.  I've been coming back here with my teen niece who is picky but loves Poké Eats. Being someone who likes to try different restaurants, there's only a handful of special places that I will frequent. This place is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"Simply awesome!  Light and fresh alternative for lunch. As much as I love burgers and sandwiches, a lighter alternative is always welcome. This is it!  I heard people talk about sushi burritos and sushi bowls at work and how fantastic they were, but I never knew where these things were being served. I found this place by accident and I'm assuming this is the place my colleagues were raving about. The food is stellar!  The service was fantastic!  I will be back here again. In fact, I may stop here again after work and get a bowl to go."}
{"text":"Excellent food - high quality yet reasonably priced. I loved the ahi tuna and spicy tuna. I also loved the large selection of veggies and sauces."}
{"text":"Wow! Rare to find a place that lives up to it's ratings. I tried the 2 scoop, with Hawaiian tuna and ahi tuna. Tasted perfectly fresh and clean. Nice salad mix, scoop of rice, scoop of tasty crab mix. Man serving was very obliging, as was the Lady at register. Will definitely be returning, this food is delicious and wholesome. Not cheap, $11 for a take out lunch, worth it  though."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is always fresh & the portions are huge. The people who work there are always friendly. I will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"We loooove Poké and used to drive all the way to Ray and I10 but now we just have to drive a mile down the road. We have been twice to Poke Eats and it is so delicious. The bowl they give you is large and they pack it full. Worth the price! The employees are always very helpful and nice as well. Can't wait to go again soon."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try a \"Poke\" closer to me. I am SO HAPPY I did!! Not only was the food delish, the service was even better! EVERYONE there was so super nice and also helpful. I tired something new and really enjoyed it! I intend to recommend this location to everyone!!! Thanks Poke Eats!"}
