{"text":"The food was nothing short of spectacular. The chef even came out to greet us. Jeremy, our server, was wonderful too. Have already been three times in the past couple of weeks. The quality is that flavourful, that fresh, that good. Recommend it without reservation."}
{"text":"Finally a good Indian restaurant in Toronto!

We had dinner here on a Sunday night. Despite being short staffed they were attentive and efficient.

What we ordered:
- Pomegranate Chat (light and crispy with great flavour)
- Cheese pakoras with tamarind sauce (not oily like most pakoras found in Toronto, very light in batter)
- Mango lassi (tasted like what a lassi should taste like: yoghurt with hints of mango flavour not overly sweet, just right!)
- Madras chicken curry (rich flavour, meat was juicy)
- lamb biryani (the highlight of what we ordered, the rice was infused with flavour) 
- okra (cooked perfectly, firm in texture)
- naan (might be the best naan in Toronto next to Lahore tikka house)

I'm South Asian and I rarely eat at Indian restaurants in Toronto - all of it seems to be watered down and lacks in flavour depth but this place was unlike those. Thank goodness my husband insisted we try it because I now have a go to place for Indian food."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. Order for delivering and got it after an hour and a half. Called to the store to ask and they said the delivery guy left 20min ago, but when he called him he didn't pick up his phone so they didn't even know what's going on."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited over an hour after we ordered. We were at the point of walking out, and let our displeasure known clearly. More than the tardiness, it was the sheer indifference that got us. The food, when it did come, was quite decent."}
{"text":"Very tasty Indian restaurant in the upper village.   Great service.  Large size portions.   Chef/owner  went out of his way to make this a nice evening."}
{"text":"If if you looking for rotisserie chicken or flame-grilled chicken, this is the place to come. Incredible chicken, potatoes, salads, rice, and vegetables. This is now a staple in our house - and exceptionally affordable.

This restaurant used to serve Indian food, but recently changed to rotisserie chicken. There are still a few tables to sit at, but it is incredible for take-home.

Little tip: while it is not always available, try their honey-garlic sauce. Incredible."}
{"text":"The good is very tasty here and the service is fantastic. The servers were both attentive and courteous!"}
{"text":"Now sells Portuguese Churrasco chicken.  We order 2 grilled chickens, fresh and grilled veggies, roasted potatoes and rice.  Everything was so flavourful and fresh.  Will definitely return.  Thanks Billy - amazing service.  We did take out"}
{"text":"This is my first time having authentic Indian food and I was amazed at how the food tasted! I loved the fact that they were so adjusting to our different needs; i dont do spice very well and I was recommended the Butter Orange chicken (i dont remember if that is what its actually called) it was fantastic, the curry was not spicy but it had the spice flavourings yet it was sweet with an orange flavour. The Naan is definitely a worth it add-on to eat with the butter chicken. It was made fresh, and made by hand in store. The place is a little small, and for fine dinning, the service was wonderful- very pleasant server, we had great conversations with him through the meal. I hear the place gets pretty busy, but my friends and I had gone on a rainy day so it was a very quiet and intimate dinner we had. 
They had a very spacious washroom ( its is wheelchair accessible) it is a single men and women washroom rather than stalls.

Overall the restaurant gave had left me with a full stomach and a love for Indian food. Will definitely go back. 
(Sorry didnt take any pictures, we were starving and the food looked really yummy!)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was horrible. Got a steak sandwich which I was told was \"lean\" but that usually means the meat is lean, not the portion size. When I pay for a steak sandwich I expect to get more than one thin slice! Also tried the mushroom soup. I was hoping it wasn't Campbells but after tasting how watered down it was I think Campbell's out of a can would taste better! Not returning and don't recommend!!"}
{"text":"At some point when I wasn't looking, Empire Grill transitioned from a second-entrant Indian restaurant on Eglinton West to a Portuguese Chicken joint. 

I'm glad that they did. 

Recently, I popped over for takeout. 

I had heard that they operated a peanut and tree nut free kitchen. Since we have allergies in our family, our dining options are somewhat limited; if you can promise me decent food without a side of terror, my life for you! 

Service was pleasant and lightning fast (it probably helped that it was Saturday evening, shortly before the dinner rush). I chatted with the owner and confirmed their nut-free-ness. I asked about their previous incarnation. Turns out the family had a history in the Portuguese chicken business but had wanted to branch out and try something new. Relying on imported talent, they swiftly realized that they preferred to run things entirely their way and shifted gears. 

I never made it out to the Indian version, but I can advise that they do know their chicken. We ordered two combo dinners-one quarter white, and one half chicken (for me. I was hungry). The chicken was moist and tender, deeply flavoured with crispy charcoal-tinged skin. I fell on mine like a lion devouring a gazelle made of tasty Portuguese chicken. Sides were standard rice and parisienne potatoes-the latter a highlight for soaking up whatever pan goodness they'd been cooked in (I guess fat, salt and crack). The owner threw in a few small plastic containers of house pirri-pirri, which you could spread on just about anything not named Trump and want to eat. 

All told, it was a happy dinner for a few bucks less than a couponless jaunt to Swiss Chalet up the road. I will go back...unless they change identities again."}
{"text":"The service is HORRIBLE! It has been 2 hours since I ordered my food and it is still not here. It literally takes less than 20 minutes to get from the place to my home, and I called the restaurant 30 mins ago, and they said that the driver was on his way... STILL NOT HERE. I really hope that at least the food tastes good... if it ever gets here."}
{"text":"Delicious dishes. Finally Indian food that packs a punch in the neighbourhood."}
