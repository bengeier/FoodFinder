{"text":"Always a line up at this place. The food covers the range of Afghan, Persian and Middle Eastern cuisine. Randomly enough there are hints of the Netherlands in the pictures and decor. The 2 brothers who run it take great care in their food plating. Makes it feel very gourmet.  P.S More people need to discover \"mantu\". It's the Afghan version of ravioli except better, yes better."}
{"text":"I thought they were very stingy with the toppings... I ordered a chicken shawarma and they were literally counting each topping they were putting. When I asked  for more of a certain topping they only put like two extra of it... they were very generous with people who spoke their language though, so felt like i wasnt wanted there..."}
{"text":"Everything they serve here honestly is good from the sambosas to the shawarma all their meat and veggies are always fresh and the best tasting , I don't know how else to say it but defenitely one of the best shawarma I ever had"}
{"text":"Not bad.

Was at the plaza so I decided to give this place a try despite no reviews of note.

Tried the beef shawarma and while it was well seasoned and the sauces were nice it was really more gyro type meat than anything I've ever tasted or seen off the spit.

May be a decent place but I'm dropping my proposed three stars to two as I would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"friendliest service, gets super busy at peak times 12 and after 5 , huge portions! not your typical shwarma , more of an afghan touch"}
