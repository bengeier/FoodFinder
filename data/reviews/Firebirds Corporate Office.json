{"text":"I would like to see more organic food choices and non GMO ingredients. I am very allergic and have to be gluten free. I am willing to pay the price for better , healthier food ingredients.  At least have a organic salad available and non GMO tomatoes. I would also like wild caught fish not farm raised. I was very DISAPOINTED  in the quality of food choices on the menu. The chef was very nice but had nothing I would eat.  I hope to see your menu with new options for the consumer who wants to eat clean and healthy. Thank you"}
{"text":"On Easter Sunday I ate at your firebirds restaurant in Glen Mills Pa. The quality of the food was acceptable however as I indicated to some friends before your places lack emenities. Nothing indicated it was Easter Sunday for starters.
I resent paying your prices when there are not even placemats on the table. One must put utensils if need be on a bare table that was swished with cleaning fluid .
No bread plates were put on the table we had to ask. An appetizer was brought to share and no utensils accompanied it. There was alot of slaw to be dispursed. No saucer for our coffee and of course not a hint of a refill. I realize it was Easter ,however at the time we were there the business was not crowded in the least. When our drinks were brought the waitress immediately pressed for us to order. We did not. You need to see your servers are more based in their skills and do something about a few emenities. I realize time is money ,however I do not plan on returning to your place of business.

{"text":"Has anyone bothered to read Firebird's latest marketing effort called \"Scratch and Win\"? Let me preface this with we are big fans of Firebirds Woodfired Grill in Ballantyne. Love the staff, the food, prefer the covered patio because it is covered and QUIET!! But corporate recently started this \"Scratch & Win\" campaign to bring more people into the restaurant chain, and we are laughing hysterically because we did what most people don't do - WE READ THE RULES AND REGULATIONS!!! We could have read The Declaration of Independence in the time it took to read all their warnings. . .and many paragraphs just repeated prior things already written. One thing fo' sho' -- in case they don't tell you when you get there and excitedly scratch off your card when it arrives, you don't get SQUAT because the rules state you have to scratch it off during your next visit to the restaurant in the \"presence of a manager\". Despite the prizes they are offering, they reserve the right to change the prize you might get. . .the lowest being $5, and since a prize is guaranteed (unless you are under 18 or 21 depending on the state you win it in), better read those rules. BTW, the Firebirds in Ballantyne really has GREAT FOOD & STAFF. But corporate . . .REALLY? Did anyone read those \"rules & regulations\" before publishing them on your website?"}
