{"text":"Free wifi, magazine shop right next door, good coffee, pleasant atmosphere. It's quiet enough to have meetings or chat with friends comfortably. AND, the pastries, smoothies, sandwiches and salads are tasty. A definite fave."}
{"text":"They purchase their coffee from Fratello which is a five star roaster the whole way and is local in Calgary. When the product is fresh then the beans they sell are five stars. Try the Oromia Sidamo, it is one of the top four or five Sidamos I have tasted. It is also not over roasted because Russ at Fratello is a world class roaster.

However, this place has a freshness problem. I have seen beans on the shelf that are up to six months old. Sorry, but that is stale. Fratello, their supplier, will sell nothing more than 20 days old. Correct the freshness issue and I will give it a 4."}
{"text":"The first and original Good Earth Cafe.

I love this place.  Very open, lots of space, lots of natural light.  The food and beverage fair is the same as with every other Good Earth location in the city, so decor and location are pretty much the differentiators.

My only complaint is a lack of power outlets.  There's only about three accessible outlets in the entire place despite all the seating, so if you're plugging away on a laptop and desperately need power, it's sometimes difficult to get that.  But the wi-fi is free (no password) which is always nice.

One of the many places you'll find me if I'm looking for a coffee shop to work at for a couple of hours in the beltline.

{"text":"Contemporary reno & decoration, Make sure check out their no-caffeine \"Vanilla Rooibos Latte\"!"}
{"text":"I don't normally go to Good Earth as my first coffee option, but sometimes I will stop by this location when I am in the neighbourhood.  It's got a lot of space for a coffee shop with nice tables or comfy seats, but what I really like is the outdoor seating.  When the summer hits, I like to enjoy my coffee/tea outside with a book and this is a good place to do it.

Occasionally I will have a treat here and have never been disappointed, the coffee is pretty good, and I love that they have almond milk as an option - take note my fellow lactose intolerant folks!  Their lattes with almond milk are pretty good, so worth a try even if you can have milk.  But, like another reviewer mentioned, I cannot come here everyday as the prices are a little bit higher than competing shops.  Either way, it's a nice stop for reading a book alone or enough room for a gathering of friends!"}
{"text":"The drinks are always good. I can usually find a spot to sit. The only thing I don't like is live music on Friday nights when Im trying to study there."}
{"text":"Yeah this Good Earth is like the family dog, always willing to relax and chill with you. Lots of spaces to bring a laptop, comfy couches to relax in, delicious sweets, good coffee, convenient hours and the occasional pretty lady to pretend not to look at."}
{"text":"I stopped here because I thought this was an environmentally conscious cafe, as the name would imply.  I came in at 6:21 PM on Monday January 15th.  The shop was empty except for one customer who had already received their order.  I asked for a small coffee to stay. The barista grabbed a paper cup and I repeated my request \"it's to stay\".  The barista replied that near closing time they don't give coffee in a reusable cup.  I indicated there's still 40 minutes until they close, and she still said it had to be in a paper cup.  I asked \"isn't this store supposed to be environmentally friendly?\".  The barista responded that because of the wage increase the staff hours were cut and they have to use the paper cups now.  I was one of two people in that cafe, the barista was not busy at all, and there were a number of clean ceramic mugs behind her.  It's pretty awful for management to use a \"wage increase\" as an excuse to produce more waste - compostable or otherwise.  This was the first - and last - time I visit \" Good Earth\".  It's a greenwash.  Note to management: if you'd like to learn what a environmental conscious cafe looks like and how to run one, visit a Bridgehead Cafe in Ottawa...that is if you even care."}
{"text":"Cozy ambiance, yummy London Fog (Earl Grey latte), fresh pastries, and live local music on a Monday night. Perfect for an intimate meet up."}
{"text":"One of the biggest Good Earth Cafes I've visited in Calgary so far, and it's a REALLY happenin' place. Steps away from 17th avenue, and attached to 'With The Times', a magazine/newspaper shop where you can buy a few mags to peruse while you sip your java, this Good Earth Cafe draws in a crowd like nobody's business.

The service is great and their selection of baked goods is pretty extensive. Plus they carry a mean pumpkin spice muffin that I'm actually obsessed with right now :)

My only qualm about the place is that it's a little too busy for my liking. Sometimes I like to retract into a quiet place with a book and a coffee and there's just too much goin' on here to find that recluse."}
{"text":"This is a really great place close to the Ryerson campus. Their lattes and brewed coffee are definitely a step above Starbucks. You have to try the honey lemon squish cookie, it's soooooo good!"}
{"text":"7/30

This is the Good Earth Café that made me first fall in love with Chai, back when I used to work on 17th Ave.

Don't misunderstand, I have had Chai way before that first encounter, and disliked it immensely. The overly syrupy, chalky concoction that barely resembled tea in any shape or form that I had been served in other places (even Indian restaurants! HDU!) that I won't mention now... doing so will only get me in to rant mode, haha :).

But then one day, while waiting in line in the wee morning hours, a lady walked past me with a thermos full of fragrant deliciousness. 

\"What is that? That smells amazing!\" I asked her. 

\"Good Earth's Chai,\" she responded. And before I could accost her and run away cackling with her thermos, she was safely out the door. And I had mentally changed my order from Almond Milk Latté, to Almond Milk Chai Latté. No pre-mix Chai powder abomination in this place; Good Earth whips up their own housemade blend, and it is spicy and scrumtralescent. It's all I asked for when people visited me in hospital this summer, as Rockyview has their own Good Earth on site. It was definitely worth risking the migraine that cinnamon sometimes gives me.

Chai aside, their coffee never disappoints. It's not the best coffee in town (for that, I tip my hat to places like Beano and Bumpy's), but it's reliably good and! They have almond milk here! Vegans rejoice! They also have a variety of pastries and breakfast/lunch menu items on quell your rumbly tummy. Also, there was a hot guy that used to work at this location that promptly brought out my inner \"hurrrrr durrrrr\" every time he was behind the counter while I was ordering drinks. I never told anyone about that because I'm a big weenie. Yelp confessions!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, and the staff is great. I'm pretty much a regular! The only bad thing is they don't have a huge amount of gluten free options when it comes to food. The coffee and the stroganoff is amazing though."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened cafe that opened in the downtown core and conveniently close to my campus (Ryerson University). Came here with a classmate to get some work done for our final year independent study project; and we both enjoyed the space and food selection. Staff was friendly and service was fast. I definitely recommend the granola bars, Italian soda and the Ginger snap cookies - so good! Upbeat music was playing which kept my spirits up as the winter weather was pretty rainy and dreary outside."}
{"text":"Constantly looking for places that are good meeting spots...  this is a favorite.

Easy location to get to.  There is always parking.  Free spots can be hard to find, however price for city meters in this area is beyond reasonable.

Three is background noise playing but it is never to loud, so easy for groups for 6 or more to meet.

Lattes are awesome.  I bring my own cup and always pay less than posted.  When I am really hungry I have a hot chocolate, with WHIP of course - always hits the spot.

When devices need juice, there are plug-ins in various spots thru the venue - so usually able to top up."}
{"text":"This cafe is a convenient walk from my apartment, and I enjoy coming here because I never have to fight for a seat! It's a great spot to come and catch up with a friend or to study. The staff has always been very friendly, and the food and coffee is decently priced. If you're looking for a coffee shop that won't be overpopulated like a lot of other trendy coffee places in Calgary, this is a great place to visit."}
{"text":"Good solid coffee place with a good selection of breakfast and lunch items.

I had the Flat White today.  Good coffee plus and bitterness violence by the latte.

I also had the Apple muesli muffin - healthy and delicious, definitely high fiber.

I recommend Good Earth coffee house for a quick breakfast for a quick lunch stop while you're in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Good Earth Cafe for a number of years.  On the most part, I am a pretty happy customer.  I usually go there for their lunch menu.  

However, this morning on the drive into work, I was thinking about the omelettes that I use to have occassionally at the Good Earth Cafe.  They use to be baked in a large pan and scooped out.  I'd be discreetly jonesing for them to hand me that omelette full of eggs, veggies and cheese, while the barista took, what felt like forever, to get it into my excited little hands.  It genuinely looked homemade, sloppy and absolutely delicious.

So I took a sharp right off Crowchild to go by there for a quick breakfast.  When I arrived, instead of the big pan with the gooey omelette in it, they had a \"southwest bake\" that looked like it was baked in a large muffin tin.  So no more gooey mess.  This was sadly, perfect looking, pre-measured and pulled out of the muffin tin with a spatula, and dropped into the take-out containter in its perfect form.

It tasted okay, but it was a distant second from the gooey omelettes they use to serve.  This omelette had all the fixings, including potatoes baked into its perfect package.

So needless to say, I left their satisfied with what I had, but a little bit disappointed that they dont serve up omelettes like the good ol' days. 

So after that big rant, why did I give them four stars anyway?

Lots of reasons!

I do primarily go to Good Earth for lunch, and that is where they get the majority of my business.  I have never had a bad meal there.   I really do enjoy their variety of salads and their hot food.  I have tried a number of their soups and chilis, and of course, I am no stranger to their coffees and lattes either.

I am also really happy with the renovations that they did in there.  They have really spruced up the place.  They even have a magazine shop attached to the coffee shop.  Smart. :)

I also like what this company, as a whole, stands for.  Good Earth cares about the environment and they have stayed true to their mission - to be a coffee house, and to serve good food (but please bring back the omelettes...)"}
{"text":"Dear white chocolate and berry scone,

I was introduced to you the other week. You looked much like your other baked friends but with one bite, I knew there was something different about you. Your berries were plump, your white chocolate melted in my mouth and your dough - oh how moist! 

I should warn you, my new friend, (may I call you my new friend?) I think you're more like cake then scone. But that's a technicality. I just wanted to let you know that you're my favourite part of an Albertan morning. And the fact that you have plugs, wi-fi and tables galore makes me smile even more. 

Thanks for the yum! 

Your scone loving fan,
Crystal"}
{"text":"This place wasn't closed (but maybe it should be). If you're looking for good (drip) coffee, this isn't it. 

I'm in town for a work conference, so I've been trying to find decent coffee around downtown. 0 for 2 so far. 

I order a light roast drip coffee. They were out - medium and dark only. Medium was roasty and cardboardy, really bad. Not undrinkable, but barely above Dunkin Donuts. 

Service was slow - only one person working there. Pretty poor experience overall."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a quick cup of coffee. Service was good, as the baristas were a little crazy, but fun. 

Coffee was good and strong, although not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Went to the Bankers Hall location. Had a drip coffee.

My friend got a latte and said it was the best he has had."}
{"text":"Nice place, decent coffee. Atrocious service. It was infuriating to be the only person standing at the counter while three people were walking around behind the counter literally doing anything other than serve me. Anther gentleman walked in and stood beside me for another 4-5 minutes before someone felt it was time to serve us. 

The second time I went in (I always give another opportunity) I asked if they had any dairy free baking/treats. The girl recommended a chocolate macaroon. I responded that there is chocolate, so that wouldn't do, and she replied with \"there's no dairy in chocolate\". Brutal! I'm so glad that I don't lack that sort of brain power or else my allergy would have had its way with me."}
{"text":"New, clean, large space. The trend in Toronto has become coffee shops in the bottom of the million new Toronto condos.. 
Feels more corporate than local, would return."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Good drinks. friendly, comfortable, relaxing. Free wifi & there is a newspaper, etc. store next door. What more could one want? Best in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really nice flat whites.  The soy milk is pretty sweet, the almond milk a bit less so.  For the espressos, they knew to ask \"short pull\" or \"long pull\" -- bonus points for that.  They had one vegan pastry: a pumpkin spice muffin.   I'm a fan; we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"We really like Good Earth Coffeehouses to begin with. Now that there is one in our neighbourhood, we couldn't be happier! Free wifi, and great food options, along with a great beverage menu and a relaxing ambiance makes this a fave place!"}
{"text":"I figured it was time for a Good Earth update. A year since my last review, it's still one of my solid go-to spots to hang out on my laptop or meet a friend for a nice hot bevvy. This location in particular is spacious and well laid out, with a mixture of tables, comfy chairs and larger community-style tables to choose from.

The white chocolate scone remains one of my fave snacks here too.. and is also one of the first things to run out if I wait to long to come get one!

The staff are always friendly, and ordering remains a positive experience. The coffee is alright. If you're a coffee snob, you may not like it. But if you like something that's just a decent cuppa joe, this is your spot. The selection of food includes sandwiches, salads, soups and even mac'n'cheese, You can even get a panini and a small soup or salad for under $10.

For awhile, the wifi was a little sketchy, popping in and out of service, but that seems to have remedied itself.

So... the good news is, not a whole lot has changed at this location!

{"text":"J Cullen- Good Earth has brand new Simonelli Aurelia machines in almost all of their shops (U of C and Eau Claire being exceptions) and with the new machines, better barista training and the general renos at this location, I think you'll be a bit more impressed. Espressos do run a little long at GE but if you ask for ristretto you get ristretto- as chains go, GE is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Empty coffee shop near Dundas and Jarvis. Very noisy because of the endless cars on Jarvis. This is the second time I been here. Friendly staff. Ordered a large coffee and a nutty chocolate croissant. The croissant and coffee was very good, but expensive.

The dance music playing was too loud and not suitable for a coffee shop. I think the young staff chose the music.

To be honest, the place was kind of dirty. I wish somebody would walk around and remove the dirty dishes. It can't be that busy.

Would I come back? Maybe since it is a nice place. But the music and noisy car traffic ruined the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This location is a nice little meeting place, just next to the \"middle of the city\".

Coffee and everything are, well, Good Earth (meaning - decent). What is really nice is an overall setup - with tables for couples, tables for groups, high chairs next to wi-fi and charger stations... Entire location is built to make it easy for people who need to connect in person.

Parking is surprisingly easy, given that it is a downtown of a major city! And all of that city is, literally, just around the corner.

The place is not particularly crowded, even though busy - and Staff is nice and helpful, to the best of their abilities, so overall this location feels great to be in."}
{"text":"Chai latte with soy milk+pumpkin spice muffin (vegans take note of this muffin as it is the best ever)= love
Good thing Good Earth is so bloody expensive or else I'd feast on these things every morning."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Sunday morning. While it's a good looking place and they have a pro environmental and fair trade aspect which is great, they are really slow in service and product processing needs work. I ordered a breakfast panini, very berry bran muffin and coffee. The coffee was alright, the muffin was actually pretty good, not much sugar and the berries are plentiful. The downfall was the panini. The panini came to me with warm bread and cheese, cold egg and tomato. Gross. I expect this place to be good eventually. I'll visit again at the end of summer and hopefully they'll have their processes fine tuned by then."}
{"text":"Good Earth Coffeehouse is a Calgary-based chain of coffee shops with several locations in Calgary. The first location opened in Calgary in 1991, and they now have over 45 locations throughout Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario.

Earlier this year, they expanded into the Toronto market with a new location on Jarvis and Dundas Street East. They are situated in a prime location as it's steps away from the Eaton's Center and Ryerson University. Students and workers in the area can grab a coffee and a quick bite in the morning.

The new location is an open-space concept with lots of natural light, and has a decent seating capacity. Good Earth Coffeehouse also offers free wireless Internet to their customers, so people are welcome to use it to work or study.

Good Earth Coffeehouse's coffee and espresso menu are based upon the Italian tradition of espresso drinks. They chose the Italian tradition because of its integrity, simplicity and authenticity with respect to espresso drinks. I didn't get their coffee, but I will try it next time. Instead, I opted for their Caffe Latte (frappes) ($4.75) from their cold handcrafted drink menu. It was a nice smooth drink that contained a good helping of caffeine. Not expensive either!"}
