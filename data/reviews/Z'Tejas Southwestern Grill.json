{"text":"Long time yelp user, first time commenting.  Felt obligated to comment bc this was the WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!  Please do not go here... So bad!"}
{"text":"The service was mediocre. It took for ever to he refills on drinks. The corn bread was the best thing there. The salmon dish in the under 550 calorie menu was decent. The pasta dish was really heavy and not delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and will probably come here again. That said, tonight was not their best night as far as I'm concerned.  The food was less the expected. I've eaten here before and it was much more enjoyable then this specific time. All our meals seemed...lacking. Nothing to write home about either way. Service was definitely off. The waitress herself was completely fine. We were only 3 and at the end of our meal we sat around and continued talking. They were expecting a large party and asked us if we didn't mind moving, not excited about it but definitely fine. We moved. As their large party started to arrive, they noticed they were missing some chairs. When one person from my party got up to use the restroom the waiters took the chance and snatched her chair without so much as asking the other 2 of us left at the table! Completely rude!"}
{"text":"Never used to be a fan of this place...apparently they've changed their menu in the past few years, or my taste buds have matured past grilled cheese and pbj, which is a high possibility.  My hubby and I stopped by for lunch/brunch once and again a few weeks later for a late lunch.  I honestly can't remember what we ate for brunch/lunch but I know it was good (quite a bit of food though - recommend sharing if you can or doggie bag it).  The staff is all very friendly and welcoming as well.  For the late lunch we split the chile pork verde.  It was very very good (in love with Renegade's green chili pork stew though.)  We also split Leo's Street Tacos.  Both of these were very filling and absolutely amazing.  The salsa/sauce that accompanied these dishes had so much flavor - in fact all the ingredients had flavor.  These two dishes combined with the corn bread...too much good stuff!  There were more items we would like to try so we will def be back.  For dessert, we found out the apps were 1/2 price due to happy hour.  What a sweet treat."}
{"text":"10 year vet here, and, this is not even close to what I remember.  Like the one in Bellevue, food, service and consistency have all hit the sewer.  Used to be a big Samoan dude there that knew exactly what we wanted from cocktail to apps even only seeing us 3-4x/yr... now it is as if we, no not loud mouthed college kids, have to pull teeth, to get simple, basic, kindness.   Prices up service and food quality down and more and more fake rolexes.... becoming p.f. chunks."}
{"text":"We are regulars here for a reason.  The staff is great, the food is great and this business is originally from my home in Austin, TX .  This location is more geared to the middle aged folks, which is good for us. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"It used to be one of my favorite places to go. The frozen margaritas and signature drinks are still as good as always that is why I rated it with 2 stars. However once they went through revamping the menu they took off their best dishes. One for example is the cast iron skillet dumplings. The food is basic but the drinks are the only thing about this restaurant that makes it worth going to."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Best tex-mex in the valley."}
{"text":"yummy appetizers on happy hour and very decent drink specials! food was top notch and service is better than i could ever ask for!  i had the pleasure of being served by Derek, he was patient, there when i needed him, always smiling and engaging and most importantly informed me of the specials that weren't on the menu right away!  i will be back!"}
{"text":"Food: Pretty good. Like others have suggested, we started off with the Happy Hour app's: Tejas Trio, street tacos, and shrimp pesto. Food came out within minutes even after our waiter said the kitchen was slammed and it might take a few more minutes. The guac tasted fresh and we all loved the queso (cheese dip). The shrimps were't chewy or over cooked, and the steak in the street tacos were tasty and tender. We also ended up getting one entree, the baja fish tacos. The fish again wasn't over-cooked or over battered. I'm not a big fan of the mango salsa - next time I'll ask for it on the side.  Drinks: We ordered the skinny margarita, not bad, especially during happy hour.   Service: I think this part is were it shinned the most. We arrived early to our reservation and the host was happy to accommodate us. We have two small children and she offered the booth, which is perfect. She also gave the kids crayons and paper to help past the time. Our waiter, \"Chaun\" was awesome. He explained Z'Tejas and even said kids eat free tonight (Sunday's). He was also the one that mentioned that happy hour was about to end soon and that we should take advantage of it.  He was very polite and courteous. Always checked in with us and made sure our orders came out correct. He also checked if it were alright to slightly delay the fish taco order so the kids would have time to eat first.  I've read that the service can be hit or miss, but Chaun is solid. Ask for his area if you visit."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal on Friday night and fantastic service! I wish I could remember the servers name! We had chips, salsa and guacamole that he was very quick to refill, even with a table of 5 chowing down after a tough workout. I had the Crab Cake Salad which was phenomenal. The Jalape√±o dressing had the perfect amount of kick! Everyone at the table was impressed with their meals, Street Tacos, Nachos, Tilapia Salad!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and it's been really good both times! Today my friends and I were served by Pete who was really cool and definitely a great server. Very personable, quick, and professional. The best part was that he had good knowledge of the menu and made great suggestions!  I had the Parmesan Pecan-Crusted chicken salad which was delicious! A little bit on the sweet side but all in all a great salad. It filled me up and then some and I'm 6' 200 lbs and eat a decent amount of food haha.   One of my roommates had the chicken artichoke and mushrooms and catfish beignets which he enjoyed. His girlfriend had quesadillas which she liked. And my other roommate had the ribs with a side of fries which he devoured and loved.   We also are 3-4 cornbreads which is one of the best parts about going here. I was too full from the salad to try a dessert but maybe next time. We will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is one of those places (for me, at least) that I totally forget about until someone says \"hey, what about going to Z'Tejeas?\" Then, I remember \"ohhh the margaritas!!:   This past Saturday night, this is just what happened! Living only a mile from the Phoenix Open, there wasn't a place around with less than a 90 minute wait and some friends and I were starving. One friend reminded us of Z's and they got us in for a table of 7 quickly. No apps were needed as we devoured the cornbread. Even my little baby boy gobbled some up, too!  I got the wild mushroom enchailada and a pomogrante margarita. DE-LISH! I devoured it all! Then, I ordered margarita numbero dos. For someone who doesn't consume a lot of alcohol, I became Miss Chatty Cathy. But, I like this place a lot. There can be a lot of people there, but you don't feel crowded because the seating is nicely spaced. I've even sat at the bar seating before and never felt like anyone was in my personal space.   Now, I have just got to remember to think of it when going to dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before and it was much better than this time. We got a trio of dips with tortilla chips.The Guacamole was sub par. The service was slow with getting our drinks and cornbread, especially since we got there at 4:30pm and the restaurant wasn't that full. The rest of the meal was really tasty and the overall dining experience was good."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a number of times with few complaints. Sat at bar and got drink ok. Sat for 20 minutes before anyone got close enough to order food. Not happy. Paid for drink and left. It wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"This place was fun and made for a good meal after a morning of shopping.  Conveniently located in Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall.  We ordered the salsa trio as an appetizer and all 3 were very good although our favorite was the avocado tomatillo.  the waiter asked us several times if we wanted cornbread and we said yes because we wanted to try it but it never arrived which was ok because we had plenty to eat and our table was quite small but I'm still left wondering how it would have tasted.  I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas at the recommendation of the waiter and I was not disappointed.   while we didn't have any drinks there was a fun make your own drink bar with all the fixings you could ever want to mix with your alcohol.  would make for a fun happy hour place.  overall a very nice restaurant for a lunchtime shopping break."}
{"text":"Had no idea we were going to a mall to eat to begin with! We were told that we should go here for the chambord margaritas. They were very good! The guacamole and queso was delicious. No need to get dressed up to eat here. If you were shopping and needed a place to eat, not a bad choice. Any of the other restaurants would be just as good. Would have been better just for happy hour."}
{"text":"The fajita I had was good and the margarita was real strong so that's a good thing as well ;) Very friendly atmosphere, I would talk with people sitting next to me and then with my server.  Since it was Sunday, it was a bit empty but generally a nice place! I recommend!"}
{"text":"We went for the Bloody Mary bar and we discovered they use no-name house vodka when the one at Fashion Square uses top shelf for the same price. Disappointing. Also, the pancakes are terrible. I gave it 2 stars because they HAVE a Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"We eat at both the Tatum and Shea location and the Scottsdale Fasion Square location.  The service is always friendly and the food is always very good.  It is a staple restaurant for just our family and when we are entertaining guests from out of town.  My husband and I also try to have a drink on the patio at least once a month.  Happy Hour is very good.  You won't be disappointed in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in here after a day of power shopping.  She swears by the fish tacos here (*sigh* she has never been to Wahoo's . . .). Service?  Inattentive, though friendly.  I hate to give a bad review to a nice server, but I also hate getting to the bottom of my water glass without a refill. Food?  Fish tacos were tasty - but the best part about them was the dipping sauce.  We also had little grilled shrimp with guacamole on corn chips - yum.  These were super satisfying! Drinks?  I had the pomegranate-ginger margarita, and I think it was my fault for making a bad choice.  It wasn't super-special, but I would be willing to go back and try another marg. Overall impression?  My knife wasn't clean, that is never a good thing.  Apparently people were smoking in the bar, which you can smell throughout the entire restaurant - gross.  The servers seemed less than thrilled to be at work, and that really comes across and makes your guests feel uncomfortable.  All in all, it really came across as a southwestern Applebee's to me.  OK, ok, maybe a bit better than that, but not great.   3 stars for the yummy shrimp appetizer and the decent fish tacos."}
{"text":"In LOVE with this place. No really. it's a little embarassing being in love with a mexican restaurant but they say you don't choose who you love right???   Z tejas...I have no idea what that means but it sounds nifty. They have a wonderful happy hour that is honored throughout the whole restaurant but the thing that keeps me coming back are the tenderloin street tacos. DELISH. not to mention their chips and salsa!   one thing I dislike is that you have to buy their chips and salsa its not complimentary and its not exactly cheap. They do however redeem themselves with the complimentary skillet cornbread that is absolutely delicious. This is the one restaurant I cannot stay away from as those damn street tacos keep calling my name. They also have a pretty mean frozen margaritas that can be stiffened up with patron floats!"}
{"text":"Every time we venture to Scottsdale, my mom and I stop at Z'Tejas. Their food portions are rather large, so we split our meals. She loves the spinach salad. Everything we have tried here has been delicious and worth the money. They also have a wide variety on their menu (including hamburgers) for the picky. We tend to visit Fashion Square during busy times (such as around Christmas or Black Friday), and we have never had a problem with the service."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been loyal customers at the Tatum & Shea location for twenty plus years! We absolutely love the atmosphere, food & of course stellar service! We always order our favorite Queso dip & yummy salsa appetizers or tostada bites & our usual entrees are the delicious jerk chicken salad & the amazing filet (medium rare) with Gorgonzola and we love to indulge on the yummy desserts also! Our favorite go to servers are Mike, Bubba, Angela, Stephanie, & Bailey! We truly feel our experience is based on the great management that has been in place over the years! Way to go Amedeo & Mike!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the first time of my visit.  Was surprised at the quality of the food and drink... for a mall restaurant. The shrimp & guac tostadas appetizer was our favorite."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I remember Z'Tejas when it was first created by Guy Villavaso and Larry Foles in Scottsdale. I ate there yesterday at one of the chain's generic locations and was very disappointed. The place wreaks of a casual dinning chain. Gone is the cutting edge southwest cuisine that made it great. If you want a southwest style Marie Callender's by all means give it a try."}
{"text":"Went here with my 2.5 yo son, 2 girl friends and their 1.5 and 2 yo children.  So since I'm a momma any place that \"allows\" children (really, just has paper menu and crayons and little juice cups with a lid and straw) and is patient, is automatically a 3 star.   But even better the food was delicious - had the chicken quesadilla (from appetizer menu) and a southwest caesar salad since my toddler prefers salad to chicken strips! Ah, saves me about $6 in uneaten kid food. Yay kid.     Another plus: Staff was nice, didn't feel rushed even though it was busy. Oh, and cornbread. YUM cornbread! Oh and the chips and salsa.  I think we had probably 3 chip basket refills, probably mostly because of moi."}
{"text":"Frozen fusion margaritas are awesome!! Love them! Cornbread and food is also all incredibly great here?"}
{"text":"The manager is psycho, i dont know how they let her work there. The corporate office was no help. Much much better places to eat in this area. Worst experience ive ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Very positive experience. Despite the mall setting, this place has a stand alone feel. Very nice patio. Dinner choice pinned down to two options. Waitress solved it for me with her \"the rellenos is awesome.\"  It was. Not much not to like about this place. Solid 4 stars plus. Make sure you have a Chambord margarita."}
{"text":"We used to come here quite often, usually for brunch or happy hour, sometimes for dinner.  The food is good and the service is good.  The prices have gotten higher and no more Bloody Mary bar on Sunday.  I feel like they are regressing rather than progressing.  About $100 for brunch for 5 with 2 adult beverages.  I used to be excited to go here but I am no longer finding decent value in their product, unfortunately."}
{"text":"My wife and I sat outside to eat (we are from Michigan and it's March), which was pleasant.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  The food was very tasty, although it was not as spicy as I would have expected for the type of restaurant that this is.  Gluten free friendly menu.  I had the seafood enchilada and it was prepared wonderfully, with the food flavorful and cooked just right (e.g. the shrimp was nice and tender, not overcooked like so many places unfortunately do).  The cornbread was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great! I could live on their Happy Hours. Food quality is always the best, friendly place with nice atmosphere. Best cornbread ever"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a chain restaurant! I like this one better than their location in Scottsdale Fashion Square as it is livelier and brighter. The food is consistently good; not amazing but fresh, generous and nicely presented. Their Happy Hour is a real plus."}
{"text":"I've been to this Z'Tejas a few times. I typically enjoy their catfish but today I found it rather bland and tasteless. The Chambord Margarita I had was awfully watery; they are usually quite tasty (this was good, but not great). Now, my Tejas Mule was absolutely delish! The service was pretty decent as well. 4 stars  There'a ALWAYS interesting sites at the Scottsdale Z'Tejas.  Always!"}
{"text":"Only giving them a 2 star because the Food was amazing  Service SUCKS! 5 star on the food! We order food and drinks waited 30mins before the food was delivered by the manager. We mentioned we never got our Wine. He apologized and said he said would take care of it. One would think the MG would have  came back to confirm how the  food of service was! Nope! This was our first and last time we will go back., No wonder with a manager who  can't follow up to see how your meals was after a complaint you can't expect the staff to be any different"}
{"text":"I think I'm just going to stick with drinks and corn bread. Nothing here that I've ordered has ever really made me want to come back (minus the corn bread). I've had the mushroom enchiladas, baked seafood enchiladas, and the relleno. Although I always finished, I never left satisfied. I will give them props for making a dish with mushrooms that I didn't get disgusted over. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, usually."}
{"text":"I love this place.. Steve Harvey will too; 0) Nice mature crowd, just get here early.  I  come once a week after visiting with my mom.Happy hour is the best time of the day for me.And the sheared ahi tuna is delicious and the martinis are very tasty..."}
{"text":"I had the Pecan crusted trout and It was fantastic. it have great flavor and was really moist. The corn bread was also excellent. The service was also good."}
{"text":"No Vegan selections what-so-ever...Plus, what i was able to piece together came soaked in butter...  What made matters worse, waiter was listening into our private conversation on a veganism subject, then interrupts our conversation to make a derogatory comment about it - not realizing what he was actually implying!! He is lucky i wasn't paying for the bill cause his tip would have been zero...  Definitely, not a Vegan friendly place...No Mas Z-Tejas for me...."}
{"text":"My wife arrived approximately five minutes before me. When I arrived I was greeted by the hostess and shown where my wife was seated. After ten plus minutes we left. In that time no one acknowledged us. Brought water to the table or anything else. My wife had orders an iced tea before I arrived. We had to hunt someone down to lay for that. If this is typical of the level of service at your establishment then it's easy to see why you have the negative reviews you do."}
{"text":"I was in town on business, and friends of a friend invited me to dinner here.  Excellent frozen margaritas.  Very tasty.  I had the green chile enchiladas which were nicely prepared, and not your typical Mexican restaurant fare.  Cornbread was a nice touch, and very good, as well.  Caramel cheesecake was huge and shared by three people.  Nice place.  Service was good.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Scottsdale, and I always get the same thing: smoked chicken chile rellenos. The chicken is clean and the smokey flavor is just the right intensity. The chile itself is cooked to perfection, but it still has the right amount of juice, and the delicious mix of nuts and apricots inside really takes it to the next level. Add all this together with a great cream sauce on top and you have one fantastic chile relleno. But be sure to bring a little extra green to Z'Tejas, it's a little on the pricier side but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the queso dip tremendously. The guac tasted and looked too processed- like store-bought guac. The salsa had a good flavor. There were four of us eating and the pasta was the best: jerk chicken was great and just the right amount of heat.  The grilled chicken burritos were good: nothing special about them but nothing negative to say either.  Very spicy! The steak burrito was ok. Chambord margaritas were good bad strong. Would've liked more chambord in mine though. Overall, it's good, but didn't have exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Enjoyed being outside having dinner.   The only disappointment was they didn't have all of the wine selections that they said they had."}
{"text":"Long day at work? Family coming to town? Need some drinks to put a break up out of your mind? Head to Z Tejas and order a Chambord margarita stat!!! The refreshing, frozen treats are so potent that the restaurant and bar will limit you to three. And while you may think you're not feeling more than a case of brain freeze after your first one, you're sure to feel the effect soon enough.   If you're with a big group be sure to grab a booth or a patio seat at this cool Scottsdale Fashion Square nightspot. The patio is a fun place to people watch and take in the fancy rides that people valet. If you're inside with a couple of friends, grab a seat at the bar and say hello to Jerrod Sands. He's one of the best bartenders in Scottsdale. But don't hate on him when he cuts you off after that third Chambord margarita. You're probably slurring by now and he has your best interest in mind after all."}
{"text":"One of my best friends, Renee, has been in town for a few days & I still hadn't seen her so I knew I had to meet up w/her for dinner last night, or else I'd be the world's shittiest friend. Any way, I hate Scottsdale (no offense) so I had a lil trouble getting there & parked kinda far from the restaurant. Fashion Square is such a nice mall though, I don't think I've been there for at least 2 years!  Renee & a couple of her friends were sitting on the patio outside. Since I live 25 minutes away I was way late & they were already done eating. Thankfully, they were in no hurry & sat w/me while I ordered some grub & they ordered more drinks. I decided to order 2 apps instead of an entree, I got the catfish beignets & leo's street tacos, both signature dishes. They were both so yummy, I really can't decide which one I liked better! I really wanted a marg but since I had such a long drive decided not to. I did try Amy's chambord marg though & it was delish! I hear there's a 3 drink limit w/them & I can see why-super strong!  I would love to go to the Tatum & Shea location (much closer to home) & have an actual entree & a DD so I can have a tasty marg (or 3)!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. My husband and I came here to have dinner but due to the fact they have absolutely nothing to serve someone with a gluten allergy we had a drink and left. Who claims to be a Mexican restaurant and serves flour tortilla chips and no corn chips??? So disappointing, and we can never eat due to this! Thanks but no thanks Z'Tejas!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  You have to order the Jalapeno margaritas!!  Service was on point and the food around the table looked and tasted fantastic...we will make this an annual stop to our Spring Training trips."}
{"text":"I am usually a huge \"Z fan\" but this experience was not up to par.  As expected, we waited 1/2 hour for a table on the patio (why they have that beautiful glassed in patio for smokers is beyond me!)  The waitress was obviously slammed and our service was atrocious.  The food was mediocre at best.  I am not sure if this is indicative of this location but, my experiences at the Chandler Z have all been much better."}
{"text":"Didn't eat but had margaritas... Good drinks an enviroment! But the friends that were in town with me for the weekend ate there twice an recommended it... PS the cornbread is great!"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is kind of what you would call a mini chain restaurant. My husband and I gave them a try the other night at Fashion Square (I had been to Tatum for drinks only) and were very pleased with our experience. The only think lacking was being seated practically on top of another couple, to the point I think we were all trying to speak much quieter than normal so as not to interrupt coversation. Our server was nice and friendly, and very prompt, and bought us a free dessert, totally out of the blue! The shrimp tostada bites we got as a starter were out of this world fantastic! Everything was piping hot, fresh, plated well, and tasted delicious! I had chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin which was cooked perfectly, and my husband had a homey, southwest style macaroni and cheese. All were great. Our favorite was dessert, the ancho fudge pie. Rich, sweet, salty, spicy, warm, chocolatey, heaven. Now, it does still have that chain restaurant vibe, but overall, we were really pleased and will be back again for sure. Good value, great food, great service."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in AZ.!!!! NO MORE!!!!!!! I  last ate there 3 months ago and feel remiss in not writing this sooner. Apparently a corporation bought them out and then proceeded to change the menu!!!!! What an incredibly stupid decision to make...some corporate guy who thinks he knows all. Change some things that aren't working-fine,  but  THIS?Their signature dish, the Vodoo Tuna is GONE, they charge extra for the cornbread, the menu is much shorter and NOTHING is special... The servers were also upset as the customers are always complaining. I will never go there again..even with a free meal!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and service were great. Food was mediocre. Good for a evening with friend but no culinary delight."}
{"text":"Great Skinny Margarita loved chicken tortilla soup!"}
{"text":"2 words... Chambord margaritas  Nate & Ana are awesome! The cornbread for charity is a great touch and the chicken burrito and jerk chicken salad are the bomb! Great indoor/ outdoor patio for people watching."}
{"text":"Go for lunch or dinner, not breakfast! The service was fine and our server was accommodating despite the disappointing food. She did try to make it right and took one of the items off our bill but we will never return for breakfast. One person (out of our group of seven) had warm food and that was because it was in a skillet. My meal was not cooked as requested and when it came back, it was undercooked. My husband wasn't even able to eat his meal. On a positive note, the queso we ordered for an appetizer was good and the bloody mary's were delicious. If you visit, go for lunch or dinner. They just shouldn't do breakfast."}
{"text":"It was the worst meal ever.  Used to go there alot but took away bloody mary bar and pricing is crazy expensive. Never again"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location (Tatum & Shea) for years, but were really stunned today at how bad the food was!  The menu recently changed and we were excited to try some new items at brunch.  As soon as my biscuits & gravy arrived it smelled like seafood; turns out it was the grease? used to cook the scrambled eggs.  The biscuits & gravy were ok, but could not eat the eggs or the sausage links.  Muffins which used to be good were now awful.  Had ONE blueberry in my muffin and it was a bland white mix muffin.  Not sure what happened here, like did management change along with menu?  But beware, the brunch has gone seriously downhill.  I doubt we will ever try it again."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick to go lunch or sit in when meeting my friends! I love that as a mall employee they offer a great discount and provide exceptional service! I suggest the Jerk Chicken Salad, Catfish Beignets and Chicken Quesadilla! Everything comes with warms cornbread! One of my favorite chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service for my first visit!!! I had the Chambord Margarita ( a must have), corn bread, guacamole and the mushroom enchiladas and lets not forget the queso dip:)) Can't wait to go back on my next visit"}
{"text":"Love me some Z'Tejas!!! I have been going for years. Amazing food made fresh every single day, great margs, plus an awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Fun lunch place. Good beer and Marg selection. Jerk chicken salad was amazing"}
{"text":"Went here after a movie on a Saturday afternoon.  Take your movie stub and you will get a free appetizer.  I am not sure why we had not been here before.  It is really nice inside and was packed.  They bring you cornbread to start - were were not expecting that, so had to re-evaluate what we were going to have.  We had the trio appetizer, which was huge, so then we decided to split the steak burrito - they brought it out to us already split on separate plates - like that !  Everything was delicious, and we are now kicking ourselves as to why it has taken us 2 years to go here !"}
{"text":"I was expecting a bit more from this joint. The complimentary fresh salsas at the bar were the best part of the meal. And that they have Negro Modelo (dark) on tap. The seared ahi tuna (appetizer) tasted metallic, and the presentation was a mess. The pecan-parmesean crusted salad tasted good, but get the way-too-sweet dressing on the side. Presentation was also sloppy. Extremely nice barkeep!"}
{"text":"Old reliable is going downhill fast.  Margaritas aren't the same and just an overall tired feel at a much higher price.  Time to move on"}
{"text":"The dumplings are finally back!  For the people who used to be regulars, now is the time to come back. They're bringing back the original items.    Please bring back the dumplings. And, please bring back the dumplings. Greatest restaurant in the Southwest. The margaritas are phenomenal, as well as the steak burrito, wild mushroom enchiladas, the achiote salad. This place is my favorite non-steakhouse restaurant. But please, bring back the dumplings. I'd gladly pay more if needed to add them back to the menu.  Ryan"}
{"text":"Waited for 20 min at a table for someone to offer us water or drinks. One server went to serve a table that came in after us and two other servers were sitting at a another customers table talking (Literally right next to us). Very disappointed. We left after 20 min."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the thing. This place is the favorite of one of my co-workers, so she always wants to head here after work (for the famously strong margaritas everyone else raves about.)  However, I'm a beer man, and there are only about 5 choices here, which are a whopping 50 cents off during happy hour. When my waitress first told me that, I just stood there and looked at her, waiting for her to tell me that she was just kidding. She didn't.   Of all the things I have eaten here, probably the most memorable was the pulled pork nachos which I just had yesterday. I was expecting a plate piled high, but to my surprise they brought out the plate and there were.... 6.  Six nacho chips, arranged in a circle on my plate.  I felt pretty cheated at first.  However, they were pretty big chips... and they were loaded with heaping helpings of pulled pork which was really pretty good.  Often I think this place tries to be too fancy with their food, but these were just mounds of bbq goodness. Throw a little guac on top (a combo I never thought of trying) and I was extremely satisfied. Of course the 3 beers (which I saved 50 cents on - each) helped out with that.  So minus one star for the happy hour specials, lack of beer choices,  and the pretentiousness, and the rest is all good."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas just catered our at home Wedding. They were amazing. Marissa was so helpful helping decide the best menu and answering my many questions. Cheryl and Marissa created a seamless service. The food was delicious! All of our guest commented on the exceptional food and service. I would highly recommend Z'Tejas, Marissa & Cheryl for any event you need catered."}
{"text":"This place is a lifesaver.  Whenever we go to shop at Fashion Square, I plop myself down in at one of the tables on the patio at Z-Tejas, and I'm good.  I have tried following the shoppers around, and I actually got blisters on my feet.  So I am now kind of the designated package drop off station.  I sit there and drink, and the shoppers go buy, and when they get tired, they bring the packages to me to watch, have a quick drink, and they are off again.  So I sit at a table on the patio, drink my Dos Equis Amber, if they have it, or Newcastle,  if they don't,  and watch people coming and going.  I always drink the same thing, so I can't vouch for their drinks, but they seem to have a wide variety.  The food is average, but interesting. They have a variety from burgers to steaks along with their southwestern specialties. Their appetizers are great, and I have had them all at one time or another. And I love the cornbread - I eat the whole pan within five minutes.    I drive the servers crazy with the bottomless basket of chips for $4.49 - I am there for hours, so they don't make any money on that. And I know they wonder where the bags and packages keep coming from as they mysteriously appear at my table.  They also have an happy hour from 3:30 to 6:30 on weekdays and 3:00 to 5:00 on weekends. If you go to Z'Tejas sit on the patio - I will be the one with the packages around me."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends for a bite and some drinks.  Very social atmosphere and the food is really great.  Service did not disappoint and the prices are really fair."}
{"text":"Food is not gourmet but the margaritas are good and the atmosphere is usually friendly and fun.  I'm a fan of the pork chile verde, and of course - the cornbread."}
{"text":"Corn bread--good.  Street tacos--very good.  The baked seafood enchilada--not so good (tasted very fishy).  Tortilla soup--not so good, but maybe be average for a tex-mex style."}
{"text":"I stopped in to this place after a long day of shopping. I really enjoyed their margaritas and the food was not only delicious but the presentation was incredible. Rarely do you find food that looks as good as it tastes! Highly recommend his place, especially their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Came here today. Got seated by the host and never got service! After about 20 mins of servers walking by and others being served that came in after we did we decided to leave.. Maybe we smelled bad???  but still gonna give it 1 star for being seated"}
{"text":"Location and service was great but the food mostly lacked flavor with the exception of the mini shrimp tosatadas which were amazing!"}
{"text":"Having been to several locations in TX, I was familiar with the menu...this was a very busy location.  We got seated quickly and had a very personable waitperson.  She was busy so service was a bit slow but her personality made up for it.  The food came in a reasonable time, we did start with a trio...guac, queso and a salsa- all very good.  The mains came and I ordered the diablo pasta, it was really good but even better when she brought chipotle sauce to spice it up a bit more.  We were too full for dessert.  Good food and fun atmosphere...    I would not recommend if you are a stickler for prompt service but good service you will get."}
{"text":"Really great tex-mex! The outside seating was very nice and relaxing.  There's a lot to do in this area.  When back in Phoenix I will be looking this place up."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is horrible from the hostess to the waitress.   They don't say hello they don't great you. Wierd and rude."}
{"text":"Love it, Love it every time I go!!!! :) They are known for their corn bread it is so good! The other food is very good too."}
{"text":"Disappointing, small Margarita, dirty glass and hair on the chicken enchilada plate. Small portions for the price. I've been to other Z Tejas and it's been fine. Not sure what's up with this location. The manager did come over and replace both entrees on the table. Gave a 10.00 discount on a 54.00 bill. Don't know if we will come back to this location."}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time for Happy and Reverse Happy Hour, staff seemed to go down hill the past years...but gave it a try again with a group of friends.  Our server (Jason) was great, he seemed to have quite a bit of tables in the outside patio, but was very attentive to everyone's needs, the drinks always so tasty (just wish they didn't raise the prices soooo much for Reverse Happy Hour, used to be $5 Chambords and now about $7.50, while other places around, you can find at better deals), the manager stopped by (and impressively recognized us from the days he use to serve/Bartend in the Tempe area)... I can say we will be coming back again, must try this place if you have never been and try the patio out!"}
{"text":"I go to the Z'Tejas at Bethany Home. I'm a vegetarian and I love the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take visitors, it has delicious southwestern food and amazing margaritas!  The prices are resonable and I havne't had a bad dish yet.  My favorites include the Tostada Shimp Bites and Diablo Chicken Pasta.    They cut you off after 3 margaritas, which believe me is a good thing.....they are strong yet worth it!!"}
{"text":"To steal a phrase from another reviewer, definitely a solid experience. We rarely go to any sort of chain restaurant for a nice dinner and were pleasantly surprised by Z'Tejas. This one is located in Fashion Square, a beautiful and very busy part of Scottsdale.   We had a couple frozen chambord margaritas...wow. Absolutely delicious and somewhat lethal! Had a wonderful server, all smiles and at our table just the right amount of times. Started with the table-side guacamole, where the server brings all the ingredients and you choose what you would like to be included. We said \"Just throw it all in!\" and were not disappointed. A little less \"authentic\" than some would like - it included cheese and jalapenos - but we thought it was tasty nonetheless. It also included a bowl of salsa that was on the good end of pretty standard. The cast iron cornbread that they start you off with is pretty drool worthy - has pieces of corn in it and is perfectly warm and moist.   For dinner we ordered the Southwestern Caesar salad with Ruby Trout instead of chicken. The dressing definitely has a little kick to it. The salad was huge, definitely big enough to split between two people. The fish was well prepared, very tender and a perfect addition to the salad. It arrived tossed in the dressing and we both asked for an extra side of dressing as it was a little bit dry.   Medium price range for large servings and very good food/drinks. Happy with our experience and will probably go back at some point if we have a visitor in the mood for southwestern cuisine.  EDIT: Went to the Tempe location last night, split the seafood enchiladas and they were VERY good. Of course had another Chambord margarita, just as good as the last ones! And oh, that cornbread...wow."}
{"text":"One word: margaritas!  This is a spot I always suggest on date nights because I love the margaritas and food here!  We came here most recently on a Friday during happy hour.  Fortunately happy hour is available through the entire restaurant!  We of course got the Chambord margaritas, only $5 during happy hour.  This would be one of the most perfect margaritas in town if I never found out the calories: over 400!  Too bad because 3 of these babies will have you down & out!  We shared the shrimp guacamole bites first which were very good & not too heavy.  The shrimp has a delicious grilled flavor that really enhances the bite.  Next we did the catfish tacos, really yummy!  These are two flour tortillas rolled with catfish avocado & cabbage.  Lastly we shared the pork tostadas which were decent but not as light as the first two apps.  The best thing here is the achiote chicken chopped salad!  Usually this is what we order, and I love how they will mix it at your table.  Usually I keep the dressing on the side & don't let them mix it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the outside, next to the street that goes from the parking lot to the garage, patio. Entree I ordered had very fatty steak."}
{"text":"Attention margarita lovers- you MUST order the Chambord Margarita. Delicious (and dangerous) and oh so tasty!  The restaurant is always busy because it is at Fashion Square but the service is always prompt. The patio/bar area upstairs is open seating so you can usually snag a table up there even during busy times.  The cornbread they bring to your table is really yummy but sometimes you have to ask for it to make sure that they bring you some.  I have had a large variety of of things on the menu and never been disappointed. The seasonal menus they offer are great as well and i definitely recommend branching out and ordering off of that menu every once in a while.  Definitely our \"go to\" place for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Waited an hour. Waitress \"forgot to put in our order\" restaurant was dirty. Food was cold when it came out. Expensive for the level of service and quality of food. Stay away. So many other options in Scottsdale to eat at."}
{"text":"We supported this chain as they were going through bankruptcy but as soon as new ownership took over, this place headed down hill. They did away with kids eat free Sunday and complimentary cornbread but the service is now horrible. They took popular dishes off the menu to get rid of \"Asian flare\" - referring the crab cake salad. The lines management has drilled into the wait staff to spit out are comical ( there's no classing this place up). We've had the same waitress twice and she's a hot mess. After today's brunch, my husband and I decided that we will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I we looking for a different restaurant and saw this place and decided to give it a try. The service was GREAT. Our server was very attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Our family went here tonight to celebrate our daughter's birthday.  We ordered two of the Tejas Trios.  They were OK, a little skimpy though for the price.  There was a thin film of the queso cheese sauce on the bottom of the skillet, one small scoop of guacamole and a half full dish of salsa.  We ordered a beer and a house margarita, no problems there.  We each ordered a smothered chicken burrito.  I wouldn't describe this burrito as exactly smothered.  In fact, it was rather dry and the end of mine was so hard I couldn't cut it with a knife.  There was barely any chicken inside and the scoop of rice was minimal.  Very disappointing for a $77 dinner.  We will not be back.  I even commented to my husband that we would've had better food at a Taco Bell drive through.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Nothing strikingly good or bad about this Tex-Mex place  Service is very slow - took us 1.5 hours to get our meal  We had the house pasta - \"Was OK, not outstanding, not as good as an Italian restaurant\" Trout salad \"tasty\" Stuffed pork loin \"average, not alot of flavor and a small expensive meal\" Corn bread was great although not alot was brought out for us to try - but comes with the meal.  Mixed drinks were good  Overall and OK place and might be worth trying again, but only after trying some of the other places around  Expensive for what you get  Nice surroundings"}
{"text":"This has been a favorite \"chain\" of mine for quite sometime. For some reason whenever there is a family gathering we go to Zzzzs. My favorite part about this place is the hot waiter that I always get lucky to have-I'm pretty sure his name is Chase. He's beefy, just like the burgers! Also, try the killer margaritas, they will definitely kick your ass (especially the next morning)."}
{"text":"Today I'm going to have baja fish tacos guacamole beans and chips all good stuff and great service"}
{"text":"Bloody mary bar that kicks butt!!! Beautiful waitresses too...."}
{"text":"Great service from the girl who led us to our table, and also our server Jacob!! He was so sweet and friendly, and always made sure our drinks were filled and we were satisfied with food.  Margaritas were just as great as I remembered.. I just wish there was a slightly better happy hour deal on food.. I feel like it's still pretty expensive for happy hour but I love Z Teja's so of course I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but what happened to all the normal good appetizer and menu items?? Really the dumplings still aren't back? That one of the whole reasons I come here! I thought maybe it was temporary but seriously it's been a year! Get it back on the menu please!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great ambiance!  The outdoor patios have a jungle feeling with the street closed off by large trees. It's very quaint. Always busy."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This place exceed my expectations for sure! The prices were reasonable and the food and service was outstanding. They had awesome healthy options too. And a good kids menu. The two year old I care for LOVED the veggie quesadilla!"}
{"text":"What a nice time. Scott was an amazing server.   We started with the pork verde appetizer - slow braised pork chunks in a mild green chili sauce. This was served with a hot cup of perfectly seasoned black beans and warmed tortillas.   I had the trout for my entr√©e. Wonderful. It  was perfectly cooked and topped with a portion of mango salsa. The vegetable medley was grilled just right bringing out their natural sweetness without being overdone.   For a cocktail it was the tejas mule - a tequila themed Moscow mule. Refreshing.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh Z'Tejas and your addictvely good appetizers.  Came here for the first time in frever after having been to one in Seattle, WA many years ago.  The service was good, drinks were good, and food was as good as always.  A little disappointed that the corn bread oven was \"broken\" but they offered a free dessert to make up for it.  We'll be back for sure in the future.  Margaritas are what they're known for here so make sure you order one."}
{"text":"The absolute best Margaritas in Arizona! My favorite is the Patron Fusion. There's a 3 drink limit on these. Trust me, you'll need a designated driver for sure!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. My mom and I stopped by here after some late afternoon shopping, as it is located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, and we were looking to party for our last night in town. We ordered a couple margaritas, and they were intensely sweet and too strong to enjoy. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting my money's worth when I order a drink but there is a difference between a stiff drink and one that is so strong you don't want to drink it.) We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer while we looked over the menus. Again, we were prepared to stay a while. It actually took 20 minutes for us to see our chips and salsa. The presentation was nice, and it included 3 different salsas to try. The chips were crisp and fresh. We were not offered any cornbread that other tables were getting. By the time we had finished the bowl of chips, we had not been offered any more drinks, or asked for our food orders. It wasn't very busy, so I was confused as to what was taking so long. Since I work in the industry, I think I show more patience than most, but this was just pathetic. Finally a second bartender came on and asked if we were doing okay and we asked for our bill. From the moment we sat down, we spent over an hour there, and all we had to show for it were some chips and salsa and a couple of bad drinks. It was a total mood killer for the two of us who were prepared to party and spend our money at Z'Tejas. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, management is very bad. There are far too many options for good food in Scottsdale to deal with stupidity. The manager here tells his servers not to give paying customers free kids entrees on Sundays after 4. We have been here 6 times and all six times they did not comp the Children's meals as per their Sunday menu after 4.  Our bill is well over $150.00 each time and yet each time they \"forget\" to take it off.  Won't go again."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight with my wife and we absolutely loved it! We will be repeat customers for a long time to come!!! The staff was amazing and catered to everything we needed, the atmosphere made the night feel like it was our first date again :) Then the food, it was cooked to perfection! Overall outstanding restaurant in a perfect location. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. Our waiter was extremely rude and disrespectful. When asked for simple things, he kept us waiting and continued serving other tables as if we did not exist. No chips or salsa was brought (while other tables had it), and we asked him twice for lemons for our waters. When he FINALLY brought them, he brought them on a soggy cocktail napkin. For a higher class place, it was an absolute joke. Coming from Los Angeles, I know good customer service, and this is NOT it. It was a disgusting experience and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food but service could have been a bit better. Try the dumplings on the appetizer menu... They are the best! Also the blended margaritas are stiff so watch yourself because before you know it you will be riding a nice buzz!"}
{"text":"Those tostada shrimp bites were delicious, I wasn't excited about paying for chips & salsa. It is a great HH spot but the dinner menu was underwhelming"}
{"text":"It all started two weeks ago when I fell asleep rather early on a work night.  I usually have pretty vivid dreams, but the most unusual thing about this dream was that it was about food, specifically, peach cobbler.  Everywhere I went in this dream there seemed to be an imperative to eat peach cobbler...  I jumped from place to place all over the world enjoying the different types of cobbler.  Upon awakening I was disappointed that it was just a dream.  Yesterday, Sunday 9/4/16 me and a few friends decided to grab some dinner at Z'Tejas.  We frequent this particular establishing because of the fine margarita selection and the delicious dip trio.  Upon entering this fine Sunday evening, the board with the specials listed those 5 magical words I had been anticipating for the prior two weeks, \"Today's dessert special: Peach cobbler.\". Butterflies immediately filled my stomach in anxious excitement for I knew that this was the cobbler I had been waiting for.  The libations of the evening were to be several rounds of Dos Equis lager...  The flavor was crisp and the carbonation was satisfactory.  It was the perfect beer after a long day in the Arizona heat.  For our appetizer we requested the Tejas trio, which came with 3 professionally sized portions of dip and a basket of tortilla chips.  The melted queso, my favorite, was delightful as always.  As were the salsa and guacamole, but my mind at this point was only focused on one thing, the peach cobbler at the end of the tunnel.  For my entr√©e I enjoyed the chicken fajitas.  They were well seasoned and saut√©ed with peppers and onions.  The tortillas were nice and warm, and accompanying sides were bountiful.  I devoured the fajitas knowing that in a few short minutes the waitress would come by to receive my peach cobbler order.  Upon finishing my guests were prepared to get the check and leave, but I explained to them how important it was that I have this peach cobbler and they understood.  After a few short minutes the cobbler came out in a hot skillet similar to my fajitas earlier.  There it was, almost exactly as I had imagined one if the cobblers in my dreams.  The perfectly shaped scoop of ice cream majestically topped the perfect display of crumbs and luscious peaches.  The waitress asked if we would need more than one spoon but I assures him i would be handling this one on my own.  I jubilantly gashed the ice cream with the spoon scooping the the brilliantly yellow peaches up on the way into my mouth.  It was everything I was waiting for and more.  The crumble was perfect, not too toasty, the right amount of sweet, and the perfect amount of crunch.  Each bite was devoured with enthusiasm.  The peach danced across my tongue accented by the slightly melted ice cream with the crunchy topping.  All in all it may have been the best peach cobbler I have ever experienced.  For I think I must retire my desire for peach cobbler going into the future as I have reached the pinnacle of peach cobbler existence.  TLDR:. Peach cobbler was fucking phenomenal."}
{"text":"I love Z' Tejas!  They always have prompt and friendly customer service.  I also love their cornbread!  I went here for my sister's birthday on Halloween.  I tend to be a bit of a goofball, even in public, lol.  I used their candleholder as a hat, and instead of getting mad about my unconventional table manners, our server laughed with us.  The servers and staff treat you right, they don't expect you to be the overdressed over done-up folks that feel like they need to spend 3 hours getting ready in order to come to the mall.  They treat everyone the same there, even if you just worked 12 hours, and show up in your work uniform, like I did that day.  Relax, go to Z'Tejas and enjoy a drink and some food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for happy hour in old town!   My boyfriend and I come all the time. Their cornbread is to die for. Seriously it's the best corn bread in all the land (or at least this side of the Mississippi).   We always split the Tejas Trio and a side southwestern Caesar salad. Service is always great and we love to sit on the patio. We tend to usually have the same server as well who recognizes us every time which is another plus.   Also, their strawberry mojito deserves 5 stars on it's own. Sadly, it's not part of their happy hour menu but still freaking delicious!"}
{"text":"Try the Diablo pasta with shrimp,you won't be disappointed. The pepito chicken was also delish ( my wife's words, but true!)"}
{"text":"Service is usually slow and the food is meh."}
{"text":"Bomb ass queso dip. Good drinks. I seriously need for you all to taste the damn queso dip. Its legit AF. I wouldn't mind being asked to go to this spot again in life to try something else on their menu. The bartender was good and checked back often enough to make me smile. But dat queso dip doe....OOOUUU."}
{"text":"This is my solid \"go to\" restaurant. You only need to know three things: Diablo Chicken Pasta, Corn Bread, and Margaritas. All their food is good but these are guaranteed good.   Great for take out as well!"}
{"text":"If I had to ask for cornbread and bread pudding 4 times each, and water 5 times, after waiting an hour and half to get my orders taken, and another hour to have my entree on the table, the food better have been jizz-worthy.  Unfortunately, the guac was terribly blended, diablo pasta was bland as F, pumpkin bread pudding tasted nothing like pumpkin.  1 star for wasting my patience and ~5,000 calories that I could've better spent on Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We stopped by for drinks and appetizers and it was great. Fantastic service and we shared the pork nachos. Delish! But watch out, loads of jalape√±os!"}
{"text":"Wow. Buzzkill. I use to live in Scottsdale and was a hard core regular of the Z Tejas in  Scottsdale. Use to be an event to go to Z Tejas. This location not so much. The chipotle salsa use to be heavenly. No more. Bland and boring. Stuffed pork tenderloin - use to be incredible! Flavorful! Now - not so much. The night I went I felt like I was at a Chili's or TGIF's on a Friday night... major buzzkill all the way around....   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple of years,  I had a chance to stop in for lunch with a girlfriend. The Ruby Red Trout was wonderful. With so many new restaurants in town it was good to revisit a very good restaurant I've neglected to visit in a while. My husband and I used to come here regularly and have tried just about everything on the menu,  other than your own personal food peculiarities, I'm sure you could find something that would make your palate very happy. They have a varied and excellent menu. Sorry we've been away so long."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a basic chain Mexican restaurant, this is your place.  It's certainly an upgrade from somewhere like On The Border in terms of style and quality but it's still usually always located in a strip mall and I'm pretty sure both of our servers on two separate occasions were stoned.  The good things: awesome happy hour, awesome guacamole, really great green chili served with tortillas and the chicken pecan salad. The bad things: everything else. Every other salad was terrible. The catfish tacos - really terrible. The corn bread they serve up free of charge is ok, but anything free of charge is considered ok in my book.  Overall, it's not bad, really. If you just want a well priced margarita with your buddies on a nice patio, this is your place.  But if you're looking for somewhere special to go with people in town or on a date, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"OMG...I have been going here with my famiy since I was very very young!  I love this please!  They have these shrimp dumplings that are brought out in this skillet with this amazing sauce!! OMG i love it!!  The Chambord margarita is a must here!  It is an amazing frozen margarita and they are just better and better everytime!   I am not a fish person, but their fish tacos are delicious and they are different.  My favorite item that I get almost everytime is the jerk chicken salad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone should try this and they will die and go to heaven.  Then you should try the cobbler at the end!  It is sinfully delicious dessert that changes with the season but the peach and berry is my favorite!  It comes with ice cream of course...  Do not forget to eat the cornbread that they bring you it is hot and moist and with the butter it is great!  You might even want to fill up on it but dont because you will miss out on dinner and dessert!  I love this place!  I always will and it has a special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Bueno Queso...Tex Mex style.  I like it a lot and it is 1/2 price apps before 6:30.  Our service was super slow, but overall a descent experience.  I enjoyed the wild mushroom enchis."}
{"text":"Love the Margaritas, service is always efficient and friendly. Only a couple times i had issues with the food."}
{"text":"Disappointed as usual. I thought I would try them again being the last time I was at a different location. I ordered their Chopped Salad. The chicken was good but it was served with sunflower seeds... This was a bland salad. Served with cooked black beans. Yuck.  I was expecting something else I guess when I hear chopped salad. The chicken and the red cabbage with their dressing was the only thing I ate. Not a diet restriction friendly place."}
{"text":"Always dependable, a little on the expensive side for dinner.  Try happy hour."}
{"text":"Wow the food was good but not worth the awful service we had.  Even informed a manager and wrote in and no one wants to so much as apologize which makes me write this review.  Went in and was seated right away.  Took forever to get drinks ordered.  Then we ordered cornbread, an app and meal.  Well they all came out at ONCE!  We were at the smallest table ever so no room.  Was pretty annoyed as we wanted our dinner after our app to enjoy it hot.  The server even noticed we had no room and didn't say a word (like sorry that came out so fast!).  Actually never came back to refill drinks.  Waited a decade, or so it seemed for her to get a check, forget dessert at this point.  then i swear i told my husband she left with my debit card bc she wasn't coming back.  Had to get a manager and still took forever.  He didn't even seem to care!  A simple I'm sorry goes a long way.  Really disappointed in the bad service and just not caring at this location.  Shame bc the food was good."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Very limited menu and no kids menu (8 bucks for 2 eggs and 2 strips of bacon for the kiddo - wth!). Food was all right but nothing special and  way overpriced. Service was decent, but couldn't overcome everything else. Will not be back."}
{"text":"If you want mad diarrhea even before you're done eating m, this is the place to go too. I came here with some friends and it was OVERLY priced. My salad tastes like it came from a bag. My boyfriend ordered an enchilada but he got a crepe pretty much. My other friend who has a gluten allergy had to get a burger with no bun since this place is not gluten-free friendly. AND THEY CHARGE YOU EXTRA FOR CHEESE?!? Even though there was no bun? My boyfriends sister got three bite sized tacos but they cost 13 bucks?!? What?!? Cornbread was cold... Soda is three bucks... I could of gone to circle k and gotten a thirst buster for 86 cents. Super disappointed. Don't go here unless you want to be broke and want to be sick the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy hour + Chambord margs = even more awesomeness!  I love this place. Even full price their amazing margaritas are still a bargain. But go for happy hour, regular or reverse, it's the best!  Southwest Caesar is aces, so is the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Eat in person. Don't order Postmates or to-go. They perpetually mess up the order. Ordered the Texas Trio tonight to go- got the queso and salsa, no guacamole. This is the second time this has happened. Guess it's my fault for ordering it again. The guacamole is the most expensive part of the trio so forgetting it twice feels intentional.  Ordered an extra side of sour cream, and when I put it on my food....it was whipped cream.   The food is great, and it's a good experience in person, but my Postmates orders have been consistently screwed up. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"There is such a great variety on the menu, it makes it easy to come back and try different dishes. Last night I had the grilled chicken with artichoke hearts, spinach, mushrooms with a wonderful cream sauce and pumpkin seeds on top to finish it off. It also came with mashed potatoes and wonderful grilled veggies, included corn. It was VERY GOOD!  The happy hour is also a great value and again has many different options to choose from. $5 chambord margarita is sweet and strong! I only had one, but already felt the affects when it was empty.  I have tried a plethora of items on the menu and have not been disappointed in any of them. (The salads are great too!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come here for a date night and wanting to try somewhere new. Our server Steph was wonderful! She was very knowledgeable and sweet. They had accidentally put chicken instead of steak in my burrito and they were very apologetic and got me my correct order within 5 minutes! Because of the mix up they gave us dessert on the house!! It was fantastic service! Our drinks were never less than half full and the margarita was awesome! I would recommend this place to anyone, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"The happy hour here is great! Lots of appetizers to choose from at great prices. We had a shrimp and avacado on a tostada, street tacos, a pork dish, and several drinks and the total was around $35.The shrimp and avacado was my favorite!  I am looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"I too had the privilege of dining here this evening and found the food and service to be the best its been in years.  I have always had a great experience dining at Ztejas.  Normally I tend to take a first date here as the margariatas can turn a 5 or 6 into a 10. (no explanation necessary).  Anyhow, tonight i didn't drink as I wanted to fully appreciate the food and focus on giving it a thorough evaluation. Our waiter was great, my water was consistenly being filled and the GM was very hospitable.  I had the grilled shrimp and guacamole tostada bites for an appetizer.  Wow, were these delicious.  Fresh guac, shrimp was grilled to perfection and tostadas were fresh as well.  I also Inhaled my own cornbread.  If you are looking to carboload before a big cardio day or race, this is for you! I then had my normal  red chile and mango steak salad as the main. I typically have an appetite fit for a pro wrestler, but tonight after my own cornbread and shrimp tostadas... I couldn't finish my main course. I also believe the portions are generous.  for 11 bucks a steak salad with fresh meat and mangos is a very good deal and certainly economical compared to most restaurants.  Anyhow, it was a fine dining experience from service to food and I will definitely be back there to take down some ritas, tortiallas, and maybe some chicas! just kidding."}
{"text":"this place is great for happy hour i loved the chambord margarita and the tejas trio the margaritas are limited to 3 so be careful lol"}
{"text":"We had a large group and the service was quick and friendly. The chambord margaritas are the best. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I ate here once and swore never to come back but since it was my friend's birthday and this was where he wanted, this was where we went.  We decided to do reverse Happy Hour and none of us came early to get tables to the 10 of us waited a fair amount of time to pull 3 tables together.   The food was just okay, nothing special or anything. My friend ordered almost every dish that didnt contain meat off the HH menu. Food came out pretty fast. Just everything seem to contain guacamole and chips.   Service was not that great. They seem to never be around and they messed up on our checks several times, and took them forever to fix."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for anything even resembling Mexican food, so it was a pretty sure bet I was going to like Z'Tejas.  We went for happy hour and while I thought that 1/2 off appetizers was a great deal, I felt that the $1 off margaritas and 50 cents off beers was a little on the stingy side.  Call me cheap, but 50 cents?  I mean....c'mon!  The appetizers were yummy.  We especially liked the catfish tacos and the quesadilla.  The cornbread was delicious, as well (oh, sweet, sweet carbs....)  I had heard friends RAVE about the Chambord Margaritas and let me say, mine was STRONG.  I can see why they cut you off at 3.  If I had put down a couple more of these, I wouldn't have been able to remember my name.  All in all, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I like this place for Happy Hour.  The shrimp tostadas are terrific and mini steak tacos are fun.  The atmosphere is ok and the wait staff is friendly and service is professional and fast.  Great first date place."}
{"text":"Bad service. Cheapo management. Overpriced. Full restaurant lunch Ties. Only 3 servers."}
{"text":"Aaah! This place, which was known for its very strong margaritas, is under new ownership. And the drinks are WEAK, people! Very, very sad. Not that I probably need the extra alcohol, but still.. My husband and I went here over the weekend, used to the margaritas we've had for years (chambord for me, sixth-street for him). We tasted them and, blech! They tasted like they came from those Tastee-freeze machines at a state fair, or something. When my husband complained to the waitress, she simply told him that if he wanted a strong drink he \"should order the frozen ones.\" Right... Seriously, the rude waitress thing was something new, too. Usually people there have been really friendly. Then I had the same wild mushroom enchiladas I've always had. I was dismayed to find that the enchiladas now include squash and carrots and other veggies inside. It really ruins the flavor. Not only that, but the yummy black bean and avocado-onion-tomato salsa that used to come as a side dish has been replaced with -- carrot and raw onion strips. Who the hell eats carrot sticks with an enchilada??? Ugh. They've ruined this place, which used to be my favorite standard Happy Hour/cheap food place. So, so sad. Any recommendations for a new happy hour, anyone?"}
{"text":"Cornbread: good Drinks: good Service: good Street tacos: good  Trio appetizer: good   Always have a good time with friends here but it might be because I drink a lot.. Gets super busy around weekends but weekdays are usually no problem. Do not be afraid to sit around the bar if hungry during busy time as the servers there are really good. If you like to drink the Chambord Margarita is amazing and a must try."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The food is overpriced and mediocre at best. The service was horrendous. We waited an hour for food with no communication from our server. We finally said something to the manager who never came back to follow up as she said she would. Go to Uberrito next store, better food, better value."}
{"text":"The menu is fairly diverse. Most of my friends ordered some Mexican dishes but of course, I would be the strange person to order pasta.   The mojitos here were fresh, light & delicious.   Average entree is around $12-15.  It's only valet parking, but inside it's great for big groups. This location is right in the heart of downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Where to start, where to start. I don't know if it deserves four stars or not. I am definitely stuck in the middle.   What I liked: atmosphere, free piping hot corn bread served out of a skillet, and its been so long I remember liking the flavor of the food (but don't remember what my party ate).  What I disliked: \"Mexican\" restaurants charging for chips and salsa (see corn bread comment above, though), their prices were definitely on the higher side, and not knowing who was serving me also bothered me.   In my opinion, this is a very pricey \"Mexican\" restaurant. Though I may go back again, will I? Probably not a good sign if I doubt my self returning here. There are plenty of Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurants in Arizona for me to go to, before this one pops in my radar again."}
{"text":"They just revamped their menu recently, and added some new yummy things and got rid of some less yummy things. Also the cornbread is delish, but they no longer bring it out to you without asking - no big deal. Drinks are strong, I couldnt wrap my head around the vodka-diet coke they brought me, I think I would have left drunk, so I didn't touch it, but maybe I'm a weenie. If strong drinks are your thing...then have at it. Definitely try the table-side guac (YUM!). If youre looking for a healthy option, they have roasted veggie tacos on the new menu. Definitely good food, strong drinks and sometimes live entertainment. It does get really packed on the weekends, and the service is kind of iffy, which is why the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Was worried what type of first experience we would have here since it was Easter but shouldn't have. It was noon when we walked in after church and were greeted by a friendly hostess in bunny ears  we were sat immediately and greeted promptly by a wonderful server named Frankie. She was nice, fast and helpful. The muffins were awesome and we had a solid breakfast (kids chocolate chip pancakes and a breakfast quesadilla). Love the make your own Bloody Mary/mimosa bar. It was the visit from the Easter bunny that sealed the deal! He made our sons while day! Thank you Z Tejas we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Love the food and the place is well managed. The staff is excellent and bartenders are great. They have these unique margaritas call the Shambora I think they're called and theres a reason they limit a few to a customer. I've tried most of the menu and everything has been excellent. I love very spicy food and its hard to find a place that when you ask if they can make it hotter and actually can without just throwing tons of jalepenos or crushed red pepper on everything. Really shows the talents of the chef. I highly recommend the Diablo Pasta! Dang is that frickin good!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here please! The waitress, while nice, had no sense of health regulations.  Our table side appetizer, was made with her thumb (no gloves) inside the bowl the entire time.  Ingredients added were added with ungloved fingers.  Bread was delivered with a bowl on top of it that held butter.  Enchiladas were more of a lasagna and not enchiladas.  No communication about this. Chicken street tacos were slightly warm when delivered.  To top this off, the waitress had very low jeans that showed too much (if you get my drift).  This place was empty on a Sunday night and now I know why...."}
{"text":"Went here tonight in a group of 11 including 3 kids.  We didn't have reservations but scored a booth at 6:45 PM without a wait.  Wait staff was attentive.  Ordered the kids choices and appetizers/drinks.  Kids were preoccupied with the kids menu/games with crayons.  I had the million dollar margarita and my wife had the margarita with the chambord.  They didn't skimp on the alcohol!  Chips and salsa were great - fresh and spicy!  I ordered pork tenderloin stuffed with chorizo with wasabi mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  It was very, very good.  Wife had the scallop special and it tasted great too.  Overall we had an extremely nice meal and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend, the service was quick and the food was okay. We ordered steak burrito, street tacos & a chicken quesadilla.  The steak burrito & chicken quesadilla were ehh could've used some flavor into it. The street tacos was by far the tastiest thing we ordered."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour..had a delish mixed drink (can't remember what it's called, but it tasted like grapefruit...very good!! Just had the amazing complimentary cornbread and chips and salsa...I was on a blind date and my date didn't offer to buy anything else!! Lol But what we had was good!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Z Tejas since '96 at Fashion Square (Tatum is closer to us now.).  Normally always good.  Awesome table side quac!!  Wish they would bring back the original orange peel, spicy fajitas!    ****Don't try to run in 15 minutes before they close and order food -- They tell you on the phone they are still serving, but at least 3 times we've gotten there and they say it's too late to order:-(.   Very annoying, especially as a long time customer."}
{"text":"I've frequented this location of Z'tejas a few times and usually have a great experience and enjoyable meal.  This trip, however, was my worst experience there. The restaurant was only half full so we got right in on a Saturday night and that led me to believe that we would have great service. It took us awhile to see our server to order drinks and even longer to place our food order. We realized later that she had tables scattered all over the restaurant, including outside. Poor planning on the part of management. My order came out incorrectly and my husband's burger was way over cooked. We all ran out of drinks in our glasses and had to stop eating to wait to get refills. It probably took 10 minutes from the time our glasses were empty to the time we had refills. When we were done eating, we were not offered dessert and were just presented with the check. Disappointed in this experience and hope this isn't the norm for this restaurant now. If so, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a great birthday celebration meal and adult beverages tonight.  Table-side guacamole was fun and delicious.  Shared the Mushroom Enchiladas - delightful.  Our server, Louis, was great - attentive, prompt and responsive to our questions.  The GM, Mike, was very helpful in providing us assistance in resolving a problem using a VISA gift card.  Wonderful service and special food.  We'll dine here again."}
{"text":"This is probably the most amazing restaurant in the city. Service is super fast and all the staff are very knowledgeable on the menu. Food was excellent. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the drinks weren't great"}
{"text":"My first time to Scottsdale - visiting from out of state. Stopped to have a quick lunch and drink at the bar. Bartender was wonderful and knowledgeable. Had the peach berry margarita, which was fabulous. For lunch I tried the tortilla soup and it has to be the best I've ever had. Cornbread was a hit. Would come here again if I get the chance to come back to Scottsdale. Plus it's great it is right in Fashion Square."}
{"text":"A group of co workers went here for Happy Hour last Friday. It was my first time here. The value for the Happy Hour menu was comparable to other restaurants. I had Green Chili Verde and a couple of beers. While m coworkers had some chips, salsa and guacamole . The additionally had banana's foster and some drinks. It was buy for a Friday , however it was still enjoyable. Our waiter was attentive and efficient. Food was ok nothing to write home about. But I would still go back to try something else or another Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I was at Z Tejas with a small group, 5 people total. I was excited to go to Z Tejas because it has been about two years since I was at the original in Austin. I was a frequent flyer at Z's in Austin, it was walking distance to my brother's house and it was fantastic.   This location is certainly not on my list of places to revisit.  1 - Very slow service, my water glass was empty more than it was full the whole time. Plenty of empty tables around us.  2 - 25 minutes to find out they had no Moet, no alternatives offered other than \" we have good frozen margaritas\".  3 - Portions are small, come on... this is a Texas restaurant. My Mom finished her whole meal and that doesn't normally happen.  4 - Food wasn't really good. Baked seafood enchiladas were more like canned tuna quality. The Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchiladas were meat and sauce layered on a tortilla. The Spicy Baja Shrimp Skillet had four shrimp total, yes four. The one decent dish of the night was Green Chili Barbacoa Enchiladas, it was like a chef actually prepared this dish!"}
{"text":"i mentioned in my review of the Tempe Z-Tejas that i like their food. What the Scottsdale location does better than Tempe is service and location. You can either enter from outside or from inside the mall. i prefer to mix my pure hatred of shopping with a delectable tortilla soup and some sweet corn bread served with honey butter.  every time i've come here, i've come alone. i've never been mistreated as single patrons sometimes are, and i've always been surprised at the quality of my service."}
{"text":"This place is (usually) great.  They've recently updated their Happy Hour menus and removed their late-night happy hour option.  Now it's 3-7 M-F and weekends 2-6.  Not bad overall, but I used to LOVE coming here for late-night happy hour.  The happy hour food specials aren't too amazing.  Everything is still between $6 - $8.  The best deal is their $5 Chambord Margarita.  It packs a serious punch and is incredibly tasty.  I'd say come here for that, and that alone.  Service is usually great, the food is usually pretty good, and when it's nice out, the patio is amazing.  My wife's favorite food item is the Street Tacos.  I love the Tejas Trio, but don't really like their Quesadilla, Nachos, or Tortilla Soup too much.  I would recommend Z'Tejas for Happy Hour, but not really as a regular Lunch/Dinner place unfortunately."}
{"text":"Every restaurant in this part of Arizona should expect to be busy during super bowl weekend right? Well apparently our waitress didn't appreciate the extra customers that helped pay her wages and tips. In fact, after waiting at our table for a menu and politely asking her for one she tells us \"just a minute, I have 20 things in my brain.\"  Food was actually REALLY good.  The waiter, not so much.  Eventually, we asked her why she was being rude or whether we had offended her because of her attitude.  She says she felt we were having an attitude with her...BLANK STARE!!!  We eventually talked to manager who was very nice/apologetic and even comp'd some of our appetizers.  When we were leaving we overheard another table complaining about same person.  I think her name was Molly...if she happens to be your server, I won't say leave the restaurant but I'd definitely either move to bar or a different section because she certainly puts a damper on what could be really great food/drink experience.  We were party of 4 and thought that happy hour appetizers were small plates, so we each ordered one (some of us ordered two).  Portions are LARGE and probably enough to share with 2-4 people, so I would not recommend each ordering one appetizer.    I'd also avoid the potstickers but EVERYTHING else (and yes I think I tasted everything else) was great."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times over the years and the food and service have always been excellent. Over the last few months, however, we have noticed a decline. Servers who had been there a long time are gone - replaced by some very incompetent ones. The food does not seem to be as fresh as it used to be. The famous corn bread is dry anymore. There always were highly visible managers wandering around but haven't seen them in a while, even when we were there on a recent Saturday night. On that visit I think the server started several hours prior to our arriving. He did not know the menu and service was painfully slow. All we wanted to do was get out of there. Our son's hamburger was not cooked as requested and the dressing on my Caesar salad was too spicy to eat. Shame on the server for not giving me a warning.  This restaurant had a lot going for it especially with it's happy hour anywhere in the restaurant and was always crowded. I hope they get things turned around before it is too late.   Yesterday the local newspaper ran an article that this chain had filed bankruptcy."}
{"text":"I don't get the love for Z'Tejas.Yes, its better than chains like On the Border, Chevy's, or Olive Garden but its still a chain and really nothing special. The appetizers aren't bad, but nothing on the menu blows my socks off.   The atmosphere is, well what atmosphere? It's just kind of a generic restaurant. Plus the servers seem so artificially peppy that I'm tempted to ask if they are wearing the requisite amount of flair... I know, I know, they don't actually wear flair, but it has that feel.  Plus, I hate it when the manager is clearly tasked with going around to every table and checking on your meal. Do it because you care, not just because its a required part of the job.  Both the waiter and the manager came around numerous times during our meal and the question was always \"Is everything great!\" I wanted to respond that you both keep walking up at inopportune times and interrupting our conversation, so no its not great now, but I was with coworkers and decided to be his nice.  That being said, with so many other good restaurants nearby, I see no reason to go back to Z'Tejas anytime soon."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past decade and the food/service has degraded slowly. The last visit (this month) the waiter never once came over to see how the food tasted. The shrimp with guacamole appetizer tasted very good but the design is bad, they have a 2 inch tortilla topped with 1/2 inch of guacamole with a large shrimp on top. You either have to cram the whole thing in your mouth or get avocado all over your fingers trying to bite the thing in half. The chicken sandwich was equally messy trying to eat, way too much melting cheese and sauce dripping all over your hands. Better places to spend $40 on lunch."}
{"text":"So apparently Z just added wine to their happy hour or I have never been offered the special in 2+ years. I'm not sure. Our waitress we had was one whom we had not been served by in the past and she said they had always been on special! If so Z' Tejas owes me about $300.00. Anyhow, the house wines were 3 dollars a glass last week as opposed to the usual 6 or 7. This made me pretty excited for future, though a little confused about the past."}
{"text":"If I am at Scottsdale Fashion Square this is my go-to place to eat, and I happen to usually end up there during happy hour!  The Raw Ahi Chipotle bites are fantastic!  But, it is not a lot of food to fill you up, so I recommend getting it half price during happy hour.  The pork nachos are good (but my favorite are at Fuego), and the street tacos hit the spot.  It is always pretty busy in here due to it being attached to the mall, and the servers always seem to deal with it in stride.  Their margaritas are fabulous and they have a great variety.  The sampler is always a good way to start if you have never been to ZTejas.  The only reason it gets 3 stars is I never seem to crave ZTejas; it is simply my go to place at the mall that has good food and a great happy hour... No complaints, it just doesn't wow me either."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  Service is lousy.  Took us 20 minutes to get drinks.  When the meal was done, the server didn't offer any dessert, coffee, or after dinner drinks.  He just brought us the bill and said \"adios.\"  (More or less).  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"It was an ok brunch experience. We did the build your own bloody mary bar. I choose the Spicy level, I should have tasted it first. I love hot pepper up to the Trinidad Scorpion Moruga pepper but this blew out my palate it tasted like it was 70% chipotle. My wife had the one with horseradish and it was excellent. We both order the enchiladas, one with chicken and one with beef. Both were ok but we found them to be flat in flavor and under seasoned. The rice and black beans were well prepared but could not carry the one note enchiladas. We liked the menu and will return to try some dinner items as it smelled delicious when we were there, a nice smoked meat and wood essence."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times and it's pretty good food. I don't think (so far) its good enough to pay regular prices, but I am pretty picky. I have gone most of the time during happy hour and the prices are reasonable. I love the queso dip.They have a good assortment of appetizers. I like the layout of the restaurant. It's a good place for a casual meal, to watch a game and or just to hang out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, every time and fantastic service. If you make it to the bar be sure to say hi to Mike, he is a fabulous server/bartender :)"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is like old faithful.  I know what I'm going get, and it's usually pretty good.  The last time I was here I had the guacamole appetizer, Hickory Burger, and a Patron Margarita.  All of it was good (although not excellent), but most disappointingly, I thought the margarita was over-priced for the quantity I got.  Z'Tejas isn't  my favorite restaurant in town, but the service is consistent, and it's a safe choice for dinner or Happy Hour with groups of friends with different tastes."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 20 years and I still say they have the best margs in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Um at the bar. Not that busy and didn't even get a how are you doing.... I had to ask for the glass of wine and to order an app. Why? Don't have the answer."}
{"text":"Worst hostess-management.  Arrived about 9 pm on Saturday-only about 6 tables filled .  Hostess was short tempered about seating - we sat on patio. She actually dropped small plates and silverware from about 4 inches from table and spun around and left without saying a word.  We mentioned we were there celebrating a birthday.  Waiter wishes her Happy Birthday-he is actually a good waiter, very pleasant and on the spot.  Just before 10 manager comes out with a couple workers and they put down umbrellas on patio - then start to clean the patio while we are finishing our food.  I said we would be leaving soon - he said \"it's ok\" and I said actually it's not and asked them to clean after we finish eating.  Check arrives - no asking if we would like dessert or anything for birthday celebration.   Food was good - probably better for happy hour prices - but will definitely go to another location. Management at this location is terrible."}
{"text":"Want to give 3 1/2 stars, but will round up because of great Happy Hour surprise on a Sunday!  Chambord margarita was very good. We had the Chips and trio with quac, salsa, and spicy queso dip, and really enjoyed that.  The chicken fajitas were ok.  Not bad, but just not much flavor to them.  We will definitely be back for Happy hour and will try something else. Nice patio and good service."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a happy hour and it was an awesome experience hence it is connected to the mall.   Happy hour food was great, fast, and fresh! Beer, I don't have to talk about that... Never disappoints:-)   We sat at the bar and my boyfriend was happy as he could watch the goofball game while I was writing this review. Our bartender was really friendly, exposing menu to us and helping us pick the right choices.   Music could be little louder and air condition lower.   We are for going to swing by next time we are at the mall!"}
{"text":"PATRON FUSION!!!! Wow. Love it!!! This place has really figured out how to make a margarita. It is the ONLY place that I enjoy drinking a margarita. Their food is very good & I have always had great service. Keep up the good work! One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Foods recommended....tejas trio, catfish tacos, smothered chicken burrito an more. My wife and I come here often and love the food. The margaritas are real good, but real strong.   Only downside is the patio. Good people watching, but it's in basically a parking garage.   All in all you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We decided to try Z-Tejas on Tatum as neither my husband nor I had been before. Walked in without a reservation and got a nice table by the window. Our server, Jack, was excellent. Friendly and knowledgeable and knew the art of conversation. We ordered drinks and their renowned cornbread (for a cause) and of course the complimentary chips and salsa. Cornbread was warm, moist and delicious. House salsa was rich,  flavorful and not watery like some places. I ordered the Achiote Mahi Mahi with saffron rice. The chile and strawberry compote was amazing ( don't order if you do not like heat from the chiles). The Chef (my husband is a retired Executive Chef) ordered the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin with really smooth mashed potatoes and chiles. Pork was tender and the chorizo was not too spicy. Presentation was well thought out and not \"shot-gunned\" onto the plate like a lot of restaurants. Nice execution! Dinner was great and Joe, the manager was knowledgeable and personable. Joe surprised us with a slice of their ancho fudge pie which we thoroughly enjoyed. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love their spicy pasts, also all meals come with endless cornbread and it is amazing. I definitely recommend eating herr."}
{"text":"Love the smothered chicken burrito. The drinks are pretty good to. Recommend happy hour great deals on drinks and apps. Just wish there was one closer to my house."}
{"text":"An average experience in an average restaurant. They did handle our party of 7 adults + 2 young children graciously, but to order was to slow in delivery given the only half the place was full at mid-day on a Sunday. Most everyone felt their meal was average to good....lots of better choices within a 5 to 10 minute walk"}
{"text":"After a long day/night of work my group of 4 found ourselves here for dinner. Although Phoenix may be busy with snowbirds this time of year, there was no wait for a table on a Monday night. Or perhaps we just missed the early bird special!  We began our meal with some of their ridiculously tasty cornbread and a chip plate. Guac, salsa and queso (my fave when visiting the Southwest). I'm a bit of a chip-o-holic and even more so when queso is involved.   For my entr√©e I went with the crab cake salad. Good, although I admit to being a bit envious of my colleague's miso salmon. On my list for next time! After eating a bit of the salad I was very full...likely from all the chips.  The service was good. We were seated, fed and paid within record time. There are so many good restaurants in Phoenix to choose from, but I\"d go back to this one if looking for a spot in the mall."}
{"text":"Okay before I get into the drinks, I'll start with the food.  My fave is the peppered turkey avocado sandwich, with these delicious fries.    Or, (Amber: note the paragraph change) you could get the chili verde appetizer, or the grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, or the tejas trio with guac, queso, and salsa and chips.    Bottom line is the food is solid, all the way up to the fruit cobbler for dessert.  Settle for nothing less.   For drinks, Z caps you at 3 margaritas so make it count with the chambord rita before you switch to beers.  It's good, you'll be flavored, life is perfect."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, had a salads can't remember the name but it was pretty tasty!  Plus they give you free hot cornbread yum!"}
{"text":"Horrible service won't be going back there is something wrong with this location ever since they came out of bankruptcy!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice! Being from out of town it was our first time here and we were going based off reviews.   We ended up driving by another Z Tejas to get to this one because of the reviews and boy are we glad we did!  We were greeted by Amedeo and was instantly  treated with A+ service.  The excellent service didn't stop there.. Gavin also helped us and was just as great!  The food was good, but those Margaritas- mmmhmm! Max of 3 is understandable - strong but delicious!"}
{"text":"I joined friends for lunch at the Tatum location and was really, really pleased.  The service was friendly.  The atmosphere was really nice, and the food (I had the taco lunch special) was outstanding!  I will definitely be back to this location, and it has me curious enough to try some of the other locations as well."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends and we each got something different. Every single entree looked and tastes delicious. I got the chicken artichoke and mushroom stack and are every bite."}
{"text":"Sorry Z'Tejas I've heard a lot about you so we gave it a try, not good at all.... My husband had the Ribeye and looked and tasted as if it were cooked in a mircrowave or boiled. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box and the veggies were like a bag of steam fresh mixed veggies that you microwave. I had the trout with rice and veggies, again nothing special, very mediocre.  I seriously felt like I was eating a meal from Denny's and just paid a lot more. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have food allergies, which they could not accommodate (but lead me to believe that they could).  I was sick for 2 days on a business trip.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Z'Tejas.  Z is conveniently located in Fashion Square.   You can meet up with a friend for happy hour and take care of a few errands all in one evening.  I've had lunch at Z, dinner, drinks, etc and can't remember a negative experience.  Food is consistently fresh and tasty.  Service is always friendly and prompt.  Luckily, the menu offers a wide range of options where not everything is spicy or with a Mexican flare if someone doesn't like the spice.  I like the spice!  Favorite options:   Trio App Skinny Margarita! (rox/salt) Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad Chicken Sandwich Can't Go Wrong! Shrimp and Guac Bites"}
{"text":"If you're looking for traditional Mexican this is not your place. Though there are some traditional dishes. It's Americanized. Had some great margaritas, queso, shrimp fajitas to share. There were 6 of us at the table and everyone enjoyed their meal. I wish I could remember what we all had but everything was fresh and good and the service was good with all drinks kept full!!"}
{"text":"The salads here are big and flavorful and I really enjoy the warm cornbread that they bring out before your meal.  It's a nice difference from breads and rolls most restaurants serve.  I've never had to wait and the service this last time was great.  My water was continually filled (and I drink tons so it's a challenge with me). The first time I went I sat in the bar area and the service was significantly slower, but considering it was a weekend night I suppose it's somewhat understandable.  I will continue to meet up with friends here."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food!!! I actually forgot my purse this evening. I returned to the restaurant and the manager had it in his office. Nothing was taken, and the staff were super friendly. I can't express enough how classy this establishment is. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite chain restaurants!!!  Obviously their margaritas are to die for (I prefer the sangria swirl...or whatever that is :-)  Appis are awesome and very fulfilling...shrimp tostada bites are always a fav as well as the green pork chili w/warm tortialls.  The Jerk Chicken salad is always safe, but then again, I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal here....great happy hour, sunday brunch (i.e., bloody mary's)...can't go wrong and you know what you're getting!!"}
{"text":"Z Tejas is one of those places where you know what you're going to get, you have a really good idea of what it's going to cost, and you know that pretty much everyone will be able to find something that they like.  I have to say, I'm a sucker for the corn bread, and their Diablo Chicken Pasta is guilt-inducingly good.   The Z has a wide variety of beverages, including their supposed killer margaritas, although if I'm being honest I've never really found them dangerously strong (they'll allow you to have a mere three).    The patio is the place to be, and while I'm not a huge fan of it being underneath the parking garage, it is a great place to do some people and Lamborghini watching."}
{"text":"The place I have loved for years has discontinued the MLB baseball package, very sad that we will have to go elsewhere to watch our Cubbies. We will still stop in for an occasional Chambord margarita, no one makes them better."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is awesome! They had me at the free cornbread, which is delicious and moist...and free. There are many vegetarian options, most of which are a lot more interesting than the standard veg tex mex fare, which is a large part of why I think this chain is great. The veggie chopped salad is chock full of yummy and fresh toppings, and there is well enough protein (cheese, nuts) to be quite filling, especially with the cornbread starter. The guacamole is fresh and spot on delicious. The interior of the restaurant is really nice, especially around the holidays where they deck it out in string lights (very festive). Service is quick and friendly, parking is (as expected at this mall) a giant pain."}
{"text":"The Z chicken salad was really good! We had the appetizer that came with chips and three different salsas. That was really good too! Everyone I was with said they enjoyed their food; the only complaint was that it was a little on the spicy side. The reason Z Tejas loses a star from me is the service. It was super slow! I was surprised because it looks like a place that would have very attentive servers. Overall it was an average experience that probably only deserves 3 stars but I'm feeling generous today so I'll give it 4."}
{"text":"This Z' Tejas on Tatum and Shea in particular has great staff and THE BEST CHIPS AND SALSA! I love their Salsa Verde and could drink it by the gallon! =) Their Chambord Margarita's are par to none and they have a great Happy Hour for appetizers!  I am not as big of a fan of their entrees and they are slightly high on the caloric side; but It is a fun and laid back place to meet with people or just grab a quick bite or drink!"}
{"text":"Jeremy and his staff went above and beyond to make our visit enjoyable. The food was very tasty, service was on point and the atmosphere was welcoming. Everything was outstanding and we will return another day. Thanks again to Jeremy and his team for a great night.   Stopped in again without letting management know and the service was excellent the food was good. Jeremy definitely fixed the problems. Kudos to the staff."}
{"text":"Not the place it once was! They use to have a great Happy Hour, not anymore . Ordered Table side guacamole for $10 = One avocado. I actually asked because it seemed sooooo small for the price. The picture is how it was served, same sloppy bowl. Can't believe if you don't buy on Happy Hour it's $13! Ordered Street tacos, 4 mini street tacos= $10.00.  Also ordered the Shrimp tostadas, was equally disappointing. The shrimp weren't much bigger than salad shrimp. Big waste of money, won't return. Thought this a month or so ago, but thought it was maybe a bad night for them-NOT!  Previously the items were priced individually for Happy Hour, now it's a flat $3 off. Not worth it. Boo!  3 appetizers, 2 beers, and 3 Titos and Soda = $79 plus %20 tip."}
{"text":"We popped in here for one reason and one reason only: the Tejas Trio.  Don't be fooled by the simple name.  It includes fresh chips, hand-hacked guacamole, chile con queso with chorizo and salsa picante to create a winning combination of goodness.  We also received the complimentary cornbread and ordered the Catfish Beignets, both of which I really enjoyed.  This is a great joint if you're looking to have a light lunch or quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Z Tejas, or should I say I've always enjoyed the drinks at Z Tejas...   A while back, I had a few too many drinks and accidentally flashed this little old lady... at least she was the only one I caught looking (I'll just say that I had a minor dress malfunction and thanks to their great margaritas my reflexes were not that quick)!   I've been here numerous times with all different types of people and age groups, it seems to please most everyone.  The food is pretty good, some of my fav's: fish tacos, enchiladas, and some kind of creamy, spicy pasta.  The menu has enough variety to please different types of palates and the drinks pack a punch.  The last time I visited Z Tejas I went on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised to find a Bloody Mary bar with lots of fun mix-ins."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Their happy hour. I have only been there once to truly eat dinner and wasn't too impressed however their happy hour has never disappointed. They have HH everyday including weekends(whoohoo!) all of their appetizers are discounted to about half price plus they have amazing frozen margaritas that are sure to please any tequila lover. My favorite appetizer is the street tacos which you can get with either chicken or beef (you just have to ask) and the ahi tuna, plus they serve you cornbread in a cast iron skillet who can resist that!. Overall a great happy hour spot to meet up with friends or just have a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Lots of seating, good ambiance, large selection of food and drinks.  I recommend sitting downstairs for a bit more peace and quiet.  The Crispy Salmon entree is amazing!  Automatic 5-stars for that alone."}
{"text":"OK, go here and get the Chicken Diablo Pasta and thank me later!!!"}
{"text":"happy hour, 1 glass of wine, 2 watered down margaritas, 3 happy hour small plates at a happy hour discount, $50.00.  now i do happy hours, and know happy hour deals, and happy hour discounts.  this is not one, this is a total rip off!  and the quality of the small plates, far less than happy.  the tacos were thrown up upon my return home."}
{"text":"ugh, yuck, grossly over priced happy hour food, and way below standard."}
{"text":"Not Mexican food... not excellent by any stretch of the imagination but they do have some good items and none are bad, just lack that something special.. it's a chain restaurant.. food sounds interesting in the menu but leaves me wanting"}
{"text":"This is a solid three for me.  We went for happy hour last thursday and had a couple of margaritas, the tune appetizer, which was very good. We also had the shrimp tostadas, this was not bad, but neither exceptional.  It was just competent.  The prices during happy hour are great.  The service was not that great, though.  When we got there, we sat at the bar.  There were a couple of servers/bartenders? at the end having a conversation.  I kept making eye contact and they saw us, but kept going on with their talk.  Finally the other bartender who was there got to us.  All in all, this is a good place to go when you have some time to kill during happy hour. We used to come here a ton a few years ago.  I guess when you are single this is one of the spots to hit."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas - how have I never reviewed you before?  This is a handy local place when you want something southwestfusiony! The food is good and fresh and interesting.  The catfish tacos off the appetizer menus used to be a mainstay for me, but lately I've been doing various and sundry of their enchiladas.  One point of sadness...the cornbread isn't complimentary anymore.  (Bad enough when it stopped being jalape√±o cornbread...)"}
{"text":"Love this place happy hour. We always have a great time with friends or just for quick bite to eat. Food is alway good and the drinks are really good ! The margaritas are AMAZING. I believe you are only allowed to have two still not sure but yum yum ! Drinking this are like be on the beach lol. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are mostly for service which was excellent. Drinks were just ok. We had frozen peach Margarita and Long Island. We started with Chips & trio salsa which wasn't anything special and also had the crab cakes which where good. We order for the main course the burger with fries & the grilled Ruby trout salad. The burger was cooked perfect but the bun taste like dough and was kinda comparable to wonder bread just soft and tasteless, and ruined the burger. My bf took one bite and was done with it, fries were good. My salad was ok, dressing was a little sweet, and the grilled trout on top had no flavor and just tasted bland. Overall the service was the best part about having dinner here, but the food was just not good. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Meh....   Let's start with the positives:  Our server was friendly and awesome.  The cornbread served in the cast iron pan was rustic and fresh (piping hot from the oven).  The food presentation was pretty and appealing.  The ambience was rustic, but the place was bustling -- but I went on Black Friday.  It probably isn't usually this crazy.  The prices are middle of the road.  The negatives:  Too bad the food did not taste as good as it looked.  Everything seemed to need some salt and they used the same slaw in the ahi bites appetizer as in the fish tacos I ordered.  This homogenous taste experience left much to be desired.  Why they serve fish tacos rolled in a gummy flour tortilla is a mystery.  If you are going to serve a rolled taco, it better be a fresh corn tortilla.  The gummy flour tortilla stuck to my teeth and top of my mouth.   I ate 2 pieces this way and eventually just took my fork and gutted the two remaining pieces and the experience was much better.  I guess I am used to real Mexican food and enjoy good Cali-Mex and Tex-Mex.  However, this place would not qualify as good in my book.  I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.  My sister chose this restaurant.  I definitely will not return on my own volition."}
{"text":"Whenever I am back in AZ, this is the first and sometimes the only place I will eat! Everything is good - love all the apps and margaritas!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Upscale foods served with an upbeat twist....  Always a pleasure eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, that I have rarely written a bad review and I have never complained at a restaurant before. The whole experience was unpleasant from beginning to end. Our server, Kristyl, was perhaps new, but that was unclear. We were seated at a table and with no utensils. Cornbread was brought out after 25 minutes and yet we still had no utensils or plates and it took another 10 minutes to get the server to bring them. Never once did an apology come out of her mouth. We were never asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water. Our food order came out 40 minutes after placing the order with absolutely no apology. This is 15 minutes after we were told they no longer had rice. What southwestern restaurant runs out of rice? Then an assumption was made that my sister would want vegetables with her order so that was brought out without even asking if if she'd prefer that or salad.  We said something to the manager, Hailey, about the long wait and her response was apologetic yet making an excuse that this is not what the ticket time stated.  After the complaint the server was even considerably colder in her demeanor. The food itself is subpar and completely overpriced with no creativity whatsoever. We finally requested the check and realized they took $20 off the bill for the long wait time, which is more than fair and much appreciated. However, the manager never came back to tell us that is what she was doing for us and apologize again.  The server never apologized and told us about the resolution.   I would never eat here again.  This place has been around for too long and has overinflated opinion of itself.  There are much better places to eat which have superior food, service and price."}
{"text":"Wow so ok... From the words of our server, \"In order to \"class up\" the same menu z Tejas has adjusted the menu.\"  Don't be fooled- it's the SAME menu, they want you to drink for cheap at $5 per drink but they want you to pay more for the same food as before in order to earn a star or put some cash in the CEO's pocket book.  Oh...  NO MORE COMPLEMENTARY CORNBREAD.  They're masking it with \"we donate proceeds to ...\" And next they'll give 50% of the proceeds somewhere else...  This is not a fine dining restaurant. It's a happy hour with a bar.  If you want to attract a crowd or earn a star, change the menu and your style of serving.   Wow. Disappointed returning customers and Won't be back.  How's that for your pocket book."}
{"text":"I miss this restaurant so much. Their tortilla soup and jerk chicken salad speaks to my soul. I recommend trying these two items because they are delicious. While I enjoy the Scottsdale location, the Tempe one is nice too."}
{"text":"I had the fajitas and hubby had Caesar salad and tomato basil soup. Each and every dish was delicious and fresh. If we weren't visiting we'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The chicken burrito (we substituted red with green sauce) was exceptional. We sat in the lower level and the atmosphere did not have much character-- chainlike. We have frequented Z'tejas since early days in Austin.   The cornbread was bland in our opinion, and as we looked at other tables, it was not favored by several guests.  The shrimp cilantro pesto appetizer was delicious.   Service was great, I would rate a 3.5"}
{"text":"Tried to hit up this place for happy hour but arrived an hour too early.   Ordered a couple of entrees and they were decent.  There's a lot of seating so this place is great for groups.  The dinner salads looked quite tasty."}
{"text":"I came here last nigh with friends, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup because everyone I used to work with said it was amazing. When the waiter brought me the soup it looked like mush than soup. It even tasted like chicken curry than tortilla soup. Next time I come here to eat I will order something else."}
{"text":"LOVE happy hour.  LOVE the cleanliness of the place.  LOVE the friendly servers.  LOVE the Bloody Mary bar on Sunday mornings.  LOVE.  LOVE.  LOVE.  And don't get me started on the Chambord margaritas.  Drink one.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Attention Please....Chef Danny is a Genius !!!! He is obviously passionate about his resteraunt and it comes through the food .The level of perfection when creating his Grilled Romain is a ####out of this world experience##### Danny's personal responsibilty ,reliability,and execution are all the reasons i go there for a yummy meal.The perfect margarita is also a reason to stop in ...Ideal...Perfect and premium ....thank you Danny for being a star chef !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, the service is great...the wait can be a bit long, but I have never been disapointed.  The freshest guacamole I have ever had...I'd swear the tree was growing in the kitchen.  I have been here for lunch, dinner, drinks, desert...love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and enjoy the menu because of its' diverse options. What is lacking is the service. Tonight I went with 3 friends and our server was less than attentive-in fact we had to hunt her down. We got good service from the busses and expediter but would have ordered more drinks if she just swung by now and then. If the service were good, the food would be a  5 but the prices are a bit high to beg for a refill from a random server.  Diablo pasta is spicy and has interesting flavor. Others had a steak, fish tacos, and quesadilla.  Everyone finished their food And enjoyed it but commented on the lack of service. It will be a while before I try again."}
{"text":"This is a Happy Hour Review:  I love Mixologist!  Who would have thought of putting Chambord into a frozen Margarita?  Really?  After the Midori craze of ten years ago, I guess it was only a matter of time before they tried other aperitif liqueurs.  I for one are glad they did.   I came here with a couple of co-workers after a long week, and the place was hopping. I mean really hopping. I've been to a bunch of Z-Tejas up and down the west coast and this place had a definite buzz.   BTW, the Margarita with the Chambord liqueur is only $4.99 during HH 3-7pm. The standouts are their Mexican Street Tacos (addicting and a must) and the previously noted Chambord Margaritas (served STRONG).  I've also developed a craving for their Roasted Salsa and cheese Queso (photo).   Who would have thought, that the sleeply Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall would be this hip?  They even have a Shake Shake now.    Enjoy."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  The Happy Hour here is outstanding!  I've come here a few times after work with friends on Friday nights and the place is packed and lively. I highly recommend you give it a try.   Yes, I know it's a chain; but you're in for a treat when you come here.  And people just don't leave because it's 7pm and HH is over, some stay till closing.  LOL   AMBIANCE/MOOD: The buzz and atmosphere on a Friday night is great. It's mostly standing room only, but there are a few bar stools that open from time to time.  Somewhat modern, somewhat eclectic (see photo of the mounted Cadillac bumper), but very relaxed and friendly. The first thing you'll noticed are the three flat screen, but no one is watching. LOL.   Everyone is just enjoying each other's conversation, whether they're with your group or not. Nice.   MENU: I've taken several photos of the HH menu, but it's $5 and $6 for most items. The standouts are the Mexican Street Tacos (addicting and a must) and the $5.00 Chambord Margaritas (they're tasty and strong).  I've also developed a craving for their Roasted Salsa and cheese Queso.   SERVICE: If the service wasn't good...  well... you would still would come for the food, but it's very good with all the servers working together.   The bar staff also seems to just stand in front of their frozen slushy/Margarita machine all night. LOL  They keep making one drink after another. There's a fluidness to how everyone is just hustling. Nice!  FOOD: I've mentioned the Chambord Margaritas, Street Tacos and Queso, are each good starting points.   PRICES: Very inexpensive. Expect to pay $20-25 depending on how hungry you are and how addictive you become to their Margaritas. LOL!!  So Four Stars and \"yes, we're a Fan.\"   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This tends to be one of my old standbys.  I'm a total sucker for the cornbread, Tejas Trio, and Achiote Chicken Salad.  This Z'Tejas is probably my favorite because, hey, it's at the mall, and there's good people watching outside on the patio.  It always seems decently busy here, with a good crowd for happy hour.    I also enjoy the weekend brunch - especially the make-your-own Bloody Mary bar!  $3 for a shot of whatever kind of vodka you want, and then you take it from there.  They have several pitchers of different mixes, every kind of hot sauce you can imagine, olives, celery, etc, etc, etc.  It's quite an impressive array of ingredients.  There's a decent selection of breakfast food including french toast, eggs benedict, and egg quesadillas."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan. Nice apps and a great patio for small or large groups. The salads look amazing. My question or concern is the margarita policy. Don't laugh, I think they have one. I had 2 margaritas. They are small but good. I was not offered a third. I was not driving. I was eating a snack. So, if you don't ask me, you miss out on the sale. Anyway, do they have a 2 marg limit? I can probably handle 3 in 3 hours, with a snack and a chat with friends."}
{"text":"No more complimentary cornbread - raised happy hour prices and didn't raise quality or change menu. Server have a bs answer that they are trying to \"class it up\" and be \"more of a fine dining restaurant\".  I had to have our server take 3 kids drinks for $2.95 a piece off of our check that should've come with the meal.We were also charged for our brothers birthday dessert which we just paid for, not knowing if a birthday dessert is usually comped or not.   We ordered an additional dessert too. Promise we aren't cheap....just disappointed."}
{"text":"While we felt the atmosphere was nice and our service was good, the food didn't live up to our expectations. It wasn't bad, just didn't \"wow\" us like we'd hoped. Although the Chambord Margarita was fantastic and the guacamole created table side was very good."}
{"text":"Yeah I know it's a chain so wth?  The cornbread (complimentary) with butter is very tasty, quesadilla app and the chips and sauce trio with melted queso is highly pleasing for your taste buds. Just saying...  3 stars only because our server was kinda lazy and he just plain sucks! He was slow and never checked on us, forgot to bring us what we asked for and just plain irrelevant at this point. Nonetheless id go back to other z tejas loc for the food."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for happy hour- Not anymore. The prices rose considerably, almost to the point of ridiculous. The food is still decent but not worth it without the great happy hour pricing they used to have.   We also ordered the cornbread (no longer free, but they now donate the proceeds to chairty), which is made to order. We were told it was taking a little longer because it was in the oven.  After about 30 minutes AFTER we finished our dinner, the cornbread came out cold. I asked the server to throw it in the microwave but she did end up replacing it. Must have been a screaming hot oven.   Also, after reading some of the reviews citing similar complaints as mine and getting harrassed by the business owner is incredibly disappointing. That fact alone motivated me to write this review about my recent experience there. Sorry Z, you just lost a customer.  UPDATE - I too got the harrassing email from Greg C regarding this review. I also got an email from Z Tejas directly confirming they have no affiliation with Greg C (thank god! That guy has issues to harass people giving their opinion about a restaurant). The email from Z Tejas offered his apology regarding my experience and offer to come in and discuss what they are doing and why. Appreciated, but not necessary. He also said he just dropped off a check of $25,000 to the Pheonix Children's hospital, which is a wonderful thing. I would gladly pay $3 for cornbread to continue the donations."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials.  Good prices even outside of happy hour.    Love the Pork verde dish on the appetizer menu, but you wouldn't go wrong with any of the appetizers or dinner items.  Drinks are a bargain.  Their Patron Fusion is by far the strongest margarita I've had in the valley and very tasty.    You definitely wouldn't go wrong dining here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Ordered the quesadillas from the appetizer menu... They were delicious. My friend ordered the street tacos entree and they ended up giving her the appetizer but our waitress was nice enough to get her her sides and only charged for the appetizer. Would definitely go back! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot until they discontinued the dumplings and ahi tuna appetizer, everyone in my family and friends circle loved the dumplings, now we go to another restaurant on a regular basis. We would come back more often if they brought back the dumplings. Chambord margaritas are still wonderful, and now they are half price on Tuesday"}
{"text":"So odd, I think i was here eight years ago while in Phoenix for a conference. Dejavu aside, the reason we stopped here was solely for the Chambord Margaritas. We were going to do a little shopping but the freaking mall was closed for Easter. Was it like that in Chicago too?   We sat at the bar, outside but under heated panels. AHHHHHH... :) I love this about Arizona. I don't normally drink frozen margs but this was delicious. Like dessert for the breakfast we just ate. After establishing a nice buzz we were off for a walk.   I did use the bathroom but I can't remember it now. I do remember it was nice. The buzz made memory fuzzy."}
{"text":"Their one differentiator from every other tex-mex place out there USED to be their free cornbread.  Then, new ownership apparently took over and, as one of their first moves, axed the free corn bread.  Instead, you get the same boring chips and salsa that every other place gives out.  The food is good, but nothing to write home about.  The service is typically \"average\" on a good day and \"slow\" on most days.  So, basically, without the cornbread, there's few if any remaining reasons to visit this place over any of the millions of other casual dining places out there.  Great move, Z'Tejas.  Hope the few pennies you saved on the cornbread was worth the lost business."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.. but in all seriousness..I truly only like the cornbread.. (which for me is on my 'no no' list).. guac and chips... (Their salsa has that smoky taste that I detest).. 3stars alone just for the strong chambord margaritas.. Yikes.. simply, its the strongest margarita Ive ever had this side of the Mexico border... ITs a cool place to hang with a group and people watch on the patio.. and to get a bit tipsy before heading in to Fashion Square.. nothing like dropping dollars while buzzed on margs! :-)"}
{"text":"We haven't been to this location in at least 15 years and not a single thing has changed. The bar is old and dinged up. The servers are adequate but not overly friendly. The margs are still great but this is the worst of all the Z locations."}
{"text":"When I worked at the mall, which seems like ages ago, we would always come to Z'Tejas for their amazing margaritas and chile con queso.  This time my bf and I went there for some lunch while running errands at the mall.  The food was just A-Ok...nothing amazing!  We both had appetizers and then shared a dessert.  The dessert was served extra hot which caused us to both burn our tounges....OUCH!   Now for the weird part...our server was creepy!  I dont know if he was just socially awkward or just really trying hard to be friendly.  We never received the cornbread we were told was coming 3 times.  And he just tried to start up weird conversation that really didnt make any sense.  It left me feeling in a hurry to get out of there.  All in all it was ok, it wont be the first place I think of to eat unless I want someplace away from the noise of the mall."}
{"text":"Ztejas is one of my favorite place to eat when I am here at work! You have to try the trio dip its chips salsa, queso and gauc! The staff is always on there toes working hard!"}
{"text":"Steak burrito was medicore so were the chicken quesadillas my husband ordered. I tasted my sister's Diablo pasta and that too was just OK. The best thing I ate there was the cornbread, which was moist and delcious. If I ever go back i'd stick with the chips, guacamole, and margaritas."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. Haven't been here in a few years. My waiter and greeter were great. The z margarita. Disappointing. The price was over $8.00 and it was in a tiny glass had no patron in it. Suppose to get salad first they brought out the tiny enchilada I ordered I told the girl salad first so she took it back. Salad came southwest Caesar. Not flavorful at all. The enchilada came out again suppose to be don again. It was cold and fishy tasting. Won't be back. I can see why not too many people there."}
{"text":"OK, so we went on Father's Day so it was pretty busy.  Service was slow, did not get us our appetizer (but didn't charge for it either) and acknowledged it when that was pointed out.  As someone else said, not a great breakfast place.  My Eggs Benedict were just warm, the yolk on one was hard cooked and not enough Hollandaise sauce.  My sister ordered the stuffed French Toast and loved it.  Those of our party who ordered lunch items enjoyed their meals. Will I be back?  Not sure-first outing here was not enough to put it on my \"let's go back\" list..."}
{"text":"Coming in from out of town, I wanted something southwest-y, and didn't actually realize this was a chain (yelp on a blackberry is only so helpful). I think this place is what Chilis wants to be. The food was very good, and reasonably priced. The drink we got (a hibiscus margarita) was as good as the other reviews claim - $ 8 for about a 4 oz drink. The cornbread before the meal was delicious (one of the highlights) and all of our meals were quite good. Entrees were in the $11-25 range. I'm not super excited about it, it's definitely got that chain vibe, but I have no complaints. Oh, and this location has a rather nice patio, and is right next to a TCBY =)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent. The Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostado Bites were beautifully presented and tasted a good as they looked. The Ruby Red Trout salad was loaded with trout - no skimping here. If you've never had the Pecan-crusted chicken salad, it is a nice, but not heavy, entree. If you have room, the Ancho Fudge Pie is delicious.  And of course, the best margaritas in town. I'm not a fan of frozen margaritas, but Z'Tejas' are wonderful - with or without the Chambord! They are so good, they limit the number you can have 'cuz the tend to sneak up on you!"}
{"text":"So we arrived around 1:00 pm 3/30/17  Place was partially empty, it's literally like they forgot they seated us, 15 min later I flagged someone to at least get an ice tea.   Once we got served 45 min later The street tacos were good  Service is deplorable, I guarantee I'll never darken there doorway again."}
{"text":"Chris lane is the best bartender yet. The food and live music is great!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Scottsdale Fashion Square, and my husband and I stopped in for lunch after shopping.  He ordered the tortilla soup, and the five cheese mac n' cheese and I ordered the chef's tomato bisque and a avocado turkey burger.  The soups were fantastic and that was about it.  The only issue with the soups was that his was served about five minutes before mine-- we had to flag down our waiter to ask where mine was (it took 5 minutes to get him).  The waiter brought it out after another five minutes and did apologize, but a minute or two later, our meals were served.  The service was mediocre, and my husband's dish was a bit burnt with the cheese sticking to the plate.  My turkey was very dry and I ended up spreading the avocado around, and eating about half of it.  We never even caught the waiters name and he just dropped the check as he ran by the table.  The restaurant's ambiance was lovely, and it's too bad that the service and food was not the same.  We will not be returning.  I give it 2 stars for the ambiance, quick seating, and taste on bread and soups."}
{"text":"The food was just below Okay. Just below it. I mean, I'm in the southwest, I can expect some authentic mexican fare regardless if I'm in a mall right??....Okay, so for mall food, it was above average. Prices were decent, portions were decent, service was okay. The bloody mary bar for brunch - that was unexpected and the only reason I would ever come back to this place. Brilliant idea!"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is our firm's favorite!  The food is always great but it's truly the OUTSTANDING service we receive from Stephanie each and every time that keeps us coming back.  She is a true gem and the service she provides is always above and beyond our expectations!  Thanks to all at Z'Tejas for the wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was adequate. Nothing extraordinary or that stood out. Service was subpar. They lost our reservation, then switched servers on us- leading to issues with our drink order. We were virtually neglected the whole meal. It took forever to put our order in and then took forever to cash out. On top of that, there were lots of flies buzzing around and we were eating inside. Also disappointing that there wasn't anything to snack on while waiting for our food. I have the suspicion that we were ignored because no one was drinking."}
{"text":"This place was great. Our server he was very very awesome. I went to meet my mom and step dad to have dinner. The woman at the front was very polite and greeted. It is inside the mall also has an outside patio area to eat.  I worried because it was so packed we might get slow service. Jason was very punchioual with bringing out our drinks. He recommended the frizen margaritas which was really good. They brought out corn bread which I've never really been a fan of. But surprisingly it was really good. We didn't wait long for it food, I could tell it cane out fresh. I ordered the green chili enchiladas which was great. They gave me about a spoonful of rice and like half my plate was full of blan black beans.   The restrooms were very clean, I give 4 stars because it felt a little dark, the beans, and the rice.  Gutentag"}
{"text":"South of the Border Benedicts were okay.  Would have been better made with the chorizo sausage patty as indicated on the menu instead of plain pork breakfast sausage.  Also, first Bloody Mary I got was good; second was made with watered down tomato juice that had a weird sweetness to it."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch, after my husband and I had placed our orders they come back with the wrong order for my meal. They said they probably switched with someone else's order. Then comes back and says he is having then make me a new one, meanwhile my husband is waiting and his meal is getting cold. The manager comes out with my dish and says \"there we go, i hope you like your meal, now we're all squared away.\" I'll admit, a little offended that they acted like they were doing me a favor. Then the receipt showed that they put in the wrong order but corrected the price for more expensive. Just horrible I thought on the manager's part."}
{"text":"Great place! We used to have in Washington now we have to travel far to find. Awesome Happy Hour, even on weekend (only 3-5 tho). Chambord Marg so good. Great service too. As we were leaving, live music just setting up."}
{"text":"This Z'Tejas location is my favorite out of all the other ones. The staffs here are always friendly and helpful. Love their corn bread which is always fresh and hot out of the oven. I always order their street tacos as an appetizer to share. They're tasty and yummy! So far everything that I have tried on the menu has been delish. No complaints on the service or food yet. The only thing that I didn't really enjoy was my strawberry mojito. It had no flavor and was watered down. All I could taste was the watered down alcohol and mint leaves. I've had way better mojitos elsewhere. I will be back to try their margaritas next time."}
{"text":"I love the cornbread!  I love how it has nice whole kernels and that it comes to your table warm.  My husband ordered the special, which was the duck tacos.  OMG!  I hope it stays on the menu permanently.  They were sweet yet spicy.  I love that.  The dish wasn't too big or too small. I ordered the Chicken Jerk Salad.  I order this every time I come here.  I ask for the dressing on the side and asked for Caesar dressing instead of sesame ginger dressing.  I love it.  I can never finish it though, so my husband has no problem helping me.   Service was great!  Hopefully I can make it to happy hour one day."}
{"text":"stumbled across this restaurant and decided to give it a try, ordered Pancakes off of the brunch menu and they came out cold. All the other food was great tho, margaritas were great but service could've been better."}
{"text":"Solid. I'm not in love with the food, but it serves a purpose.  My hubby loves the cornbread, so we usually end up here versus Kona based on the bread alone!"}
{"text":"I had seen these around before but never stopped in. Started with a drink menu and was quite happy. Good selection of Margaritas and others. The dinner menu was good as well. Drinks were excellent and food was tasty.  I'll make a return trip if for nothing more than a drink. A-OK."}
{"text":"It's the holiday season and I understand that restaurants are busy but when there is no sense of urgency something needs to change. I called in order for a trio which consists of hardly any prep time. A trio should never take 45mins to fulfill especially when the hostess on the phone tells you it will be ready in ten mins. As a working store manager in the same mall as this z tejas Im sad to say this is not the first time my order for a trio has taken this long. The difference is that tonight I was ordering for a party that I will now be late too. Clients ask for recommendations all the time and this is the last place I would tell them to visit. So frustrated and disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Z'Tejas and their happy hour. The chambord marg is a perfect go-to, although their drink book is filled with fresh, tasty, unique cocktails! I love their seasonal menus they put out each quarter. The Scottsdale location has an awesome patio. I haven't really sat inside as the patio is usually more happenin'.   Great experience each time. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"P4 1/2* Z'Tejas 10625 Tatum (and Shea) Southwestern One of the best Happy Hours Liked the Dos Equis Lager on tap Appetizers are $3 off The spinach and mushroom quesadillas were tasty and substantial The chile verde was awesome The chocolate ancho pie was very good (like a soft brownie) Excellent food service by Amparo"}
{"text":"After a bad start to the experience they really turned it around.  Love to chicken relleno"}
{"text":"Usually I would write great things about Z'tejas on Tatum, however, I am sad to say this was the most disappointing experience ever. We sit at the Bar after 5 pm on a Saturday and specifically ask is it happy hour. The waitress smiles says yes and places an  happy hour menu in front of us. After having a drinks, soup and a salad, we asked for a check and there no happy hour prices listed. So we ask the bartender to adjust our bill- which was $61.00 and he tells us happy hour is 3 to 5 on Saturday. Well great seems like the staff doesn't even know when happy hour is supposed to take place. Perhaps, there is a reason that they closed 60% of their restaurants. The bartender was kind and gave us free appetizer cards which required us to buy an entree, but we aren't coming back. Feels like an end to a great era."}
{"text":"I'm glad that living in the southwest has benefits other than excessive use of cacti in home decor. One of those benefits is the food served at Z'Tejas, and I will gladly put up with any number of hanging serapes to get my hands on Tex-Mex.   This is what you need to order (no exceptions):   1. Drinks: Chambord Margarita  2. Appetizer: Cornbread (so moist!)  3. Entree: Seafood Enchiladas  4. Dessert: Berry Cobbler.   You will need to take a food coma after you have successfully finished all this food. But, and trust me on this one, you will finish it because everything they serve is addictive. I would have literally licked the cobbler pan if I was not in public.   Your pants will be bursting to make up for the weight that your wallet loses over the course of this meal."}
{"text":"I gave Z Tejas 5 stars because there isn't a single thing I don't love. Their menu is creative, with both healthy and comfort choices, and everything is delicious! I've had the ruby trout, the chicken sandwich, turkey burger, chicken enchilada, green chile barbacoa enchiladas, five cheese macaroni and achiote chicken- which is worth every calorie, but don't order this often! The service is great, too. Go for happy hour, it's one of the best in town IMO. I have also ordered food to go several times and it is always packaged perfectly neat, and they give you a generous portion of their fresh corn bread.  Now that I wrote this, I can't stop thinking about the little shrimp tostadas on happy hour and the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Yep, I like it.  Another place I really only come to when my mom visits as she likes it.  I ordered the tortilla soup tonight and it was really good.  I'm also a fan of the cornbread they serve in lieu of same ole' chips and salsa.  But, I really love the shrimp and guac tostada bites.  Ordered it for my entree tonight and only $4.80-who knew happy hour apps were 1/2 price here!  Maybe most people.  Maybe I need to get out more."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy stopping here either for a post shopping cocktail or dinner.  It has a nice vibe with friendly service and the food/beverages are always consistently good."}
{"text":"This place has yummy food and strong margaritas.  Happy hour (and reverse!) is a smashing deal in the bar and patio areas... I highly recommend designating a driver and having a couple chambord margaritas.  For food, the queso skillet is one of the most addicting cheese dips I've ever had.  The green chile pork skillet is fab and you really should blow your low-carb diet and have some of their cornbread hot out of the oven with a smear of butter.   The service is pretty quick and they are pretty accommodating with carry out containers if you can't finish the smorgasbord of appetizers and food ordered.  ;)"}
{"text":"Z Tejas has always been a solid experience for me. This location has been around long before many other restaurants graced Scottsdale and they continue to have good service, a lively crowd, tasty drinks and good food. Plus, let's not forget about what they are famous for -- the chambord margaritas. It only takes two, trust me!   Z Tejas recently introduced a skinny menu and although the skinny menu for food isn't that big, the skinny cocktail menu is quite tasty! I had the skinny lemonade and somehow they seemed to hide the skinny in that cocktail! It was delicious. In summary, this is a great spot to come for drinks with friends, their tasty cornbread, some queso and an entree such as their chicken sandwich with avocado!"}
{"text":"After agreeing to meet a friend here, as this was Her favorite spot. I showed up on the wrong \"party\" night.  It was extremely loud and chaotic. I attempted to order a drink at the bar while I wait for Her, and with NO luck.  We decided to go next door to another space. Perhaps you might want to try the space on a slower afternoon?"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the food and service at Z'Tejas but we needed a small party catered and thought to inquire. Again we were plesantly surprised at the professionalism and attention we recived. Everyrhing was delicious. Price point was very reasonable.  Just another reason I like going to Z Tejas."}
{"text":"ZTejas @ Scottsdale Fashion Square has been a family favorite for about 15 years now! We've seen a lot of changes over the years however, some things haven't changed a bit! They still have one of the best happy hours in town! The frozen margaritas are a great way to relax at the end of the week. Make sure you have a designated driver or an Uber so you don't have to drink and drive. They're pretty potent! Their food is always fresh and delicious. The table side guacamole is so fresh, it's prepared right at your table. Some of our other favorites are the shrimp tostada bites, fish tacos, chicken quesadilla, mushroom enchilada, ruby trout dinner, pork verde and last but not least the Z burger. Another reason we love Z's is the outstanding service! We are always greeted and seated by a friendly host/hostess, who makes every effort to accommodate our seating preference (which by the way is the mall/inside patio). Our server Alex, provides excellent customer service, and is attentive to our needs. He works hard, making sure that everything is just right. He even knows what we like to order and will deliver our drinks minutes after we've arrived. Every time we are at Z's they make us feel like they appreciate our business. It's perfect for couples, families, girls (or guys) night out, birthdays, New Years, upcoming Cinco de Mayo, or our favorite \"Friday Family Fun Night\"! I would highly recommend Z's any night of the week!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Z'Tejas yet since I am a regular at their happy hour! Though I work super close to the one on Mill I visit this one the most since it's located inside the mall and seems to be more lively. I have always had a great experience when I eat here, I normally start with their infamous Chambord margarita and then order lots of appetizers to share among my friends. My favs have to be the catfish beignets... Mmmmm flaky catfish and crispy batter seasoned just right, it's so yummy especially when dipped in the sauce that come along with it. I also love their Tejas trio which comes with salsa, guac and their queso dip....I'm ashamed to admit that I've eaten that as a meal by myself before, lol. The queso dip is seriously addicting, you can just keep eating and eating until it's all gone. The guac and salsa or also delicious as well. Also a must try are their shrimp avocado bites, it's like eating individual nacho bites with shrimp...delish!! Oh and I can't forget their cornbread they bring it out with every meal, it's hot and extremely tasty with the honey butter that comes with it. The only meal I haven't tried yet is brunch and I am planning on taking full advantage of the \"weekend fun bar\" that has build your own mimosas when I finally make it out!"}
{"text":"Ok, I know you are all thinking 5 stars? Really?  But YES! REALLY! I live nearby and have never thought twice to stop and try Z'Tajas, mostly because I was thinking this is another mock Mexican food place. But it's not. And they don't try to be. Super unique southwest flavor with ingredients borrowed from all over the world. I had the Jerk Chicken salad and it was AMAZING! Their margaritas do not shy away from tequila being the main star. Great drinks, great food, wonderful atmosphere... but the SERVICE HAS ME HOOKED. Our server was \"Zee\" (not sure if that's how he spelled it) and I really want him and the management to know just how wonderful he was. Very professional, attentive, quick, and genuinely courteous demeanor. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"we use to come here quite a bit for their happy hour specials. it's been a while since we've eaten a full meal here, but it left me feeling a little sad.  only because when you open the menu, it feels like Chilis or Applebees. it has similar layout, feel, and seemed like, food options as well.   my dish was fine, but i can't remember it. my wifes trout was actually very tasty. they offer a 550 calorie or less menu and they still have those excellent chambord margaritas. but i think we may keep our z-tejas for happy hours."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex? More like Tourist-Mex. Ok, Chainy-Mex.   That isn't to say everything is bad. There is always a time and place for franchised southwest cuisine, which naturally occurs after a spending spree at Fashion Show Mall (http://www.yelp.com/biz/scottsdale-fashion-square-scottsdale-2) in downtown Scottsdale. Margarita specials to drown your sorrows over your newly drained bank account? You've come to the right place.  Happy Hour, Z'Tejas style, is no joke. Until about 6:30pm each day (yes, weekends are fair game but apparently end at 5pm), they have discounted food, and plenty of margarita variations to quench your lush-cious thirst. The chambord margaritas are drinks made from girly heaven, while I much prefer their regular margaritas, with lots of tequila. The half off platters of food are usually munchables and make for good finger foods while the crowd mingles away.  My last go around food wise wasn't the best. The green chile enchiladas with barbacoa was bland and the meat was a bit tough to chew, but certainly overshadowed by some very dry tortillas. Not surprisingly, the smothered chicken burrito didn't fare much better, even though it was quite hearty. The bottomless chips got the most love, especially with their trio of spicy dipping sauces.   Service hasn't really impressed me much in the couple of times I've been there and the seating will vary but I wouldn't advise sitting outside unless the weather is absolutely perfect. Otherwise, it can get hot and there tends to be more cars strolling by than actual subjects for people watching."}
{"text":"The food was good and the happy hour prices aren't bad. I'm from Texas so I had to try the queso, and it didn't disappoint. The street tacos were tasty, but I wouldn't recommend the guacamole shrimp tostada bite things. Also, the sixth street margarita is too sweet. Go for 'Zee best'."}
{"text":"I love Z Tejas, but the food at this location was disappointing and subpar. We were all disappointed in the food. The seafood enchilafas definitely were far worse than the ild town Scottsdale location. My food was barely hot.The veggies served with the fajitas were not charred, just warm and soggy. The server was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great food!! Check out their happy hour. The street tacos and chicken quesadilla is soo good. Our waiter sucked (Sonja) had to flag her down every time. Never checked on us."}
{"text":"Very good southwestern fare.  Have been to two of their locations and both were equally good.  Very good service, and an excellent Sunday Brunch (brunch, what a wonderful way to say it's okay to drink alcohol before noon)..."}
{"text":"Please come to Hawaii. Please?   This is some of the best chain Southwestern food I've ever had. I was skeptical: I come all the way to Scottsdale from Hawaii and want Mexican and my friend takes me to some chain in a mall? Great.   However, I was quite impressed by the freshness and quality of the food - my relleno was very good - and the 'ritas were tasty as well. Flavorful food, reasonable prices, strong drinks: what more do you need?  Seriously, Z'Tejas. If you come to Hawaii I'll let you crash on my couch."}
{"text":"Went with group of 10 had drinks, appetizers and dinner. Food and service were excellent. Had an excellent evening and was able to watch the World Series game 7."}

{"text":"Ruined my favorite salad! Ordered a southwest Caesar  with chicken and cornbread on UberEATS. For $26 I received a small handful of romaine, with cheap powdered parmesan. Cornbread was dry, burned and inedible.   Appreciate that you at least packed the extra dressing.   Whoever was on expo should be embarrassed for putting this out!!!!"}
{"text":"ordered a wrap, which was decent.  only problem was the side dish was left watery and left my wraps all soggy....gross.  forked over 12 dollars and vowed never to return unless its for happy hour."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel in the area and for some reason we were told that Z'Tejas was not the best. I am so glad that we did not follow that recommendation, we ended up eating here and the food was absolutely incredible. The blackened catfish tacos were amazing and the shrimp and guac bites were absolutely incredible, those two were my favorites but honestly everything that we ordered was fantastic. The hard time margaritas were great and the ambience of the place was good with water fountains and misters on the patio that made dining on a hot evening comfortable. The wait staff was good except for our actual server who was too busy holding up the walls to take care of my family. Luckily the other servers carried her and the food more than made up for it. The only thing that kept me from 5 stars was the server, but the food is really worth 6 stars."}
{"text":"Rule 1: Don't expect brilliant Mexican food in a suburban restaurant. Rule 2: When the clientele in said restaurant has a large number of mom-jeans-wearing WASPs, rule 1 x 10.   Z'Tejas promises \"Mexican-inspired\" cuisine but they deliver a tepid blend of ingredients that do little to inspire one's tastebuds.  The baked seafood enchilada had next to no taste, and when combined with a cardboard-like texture it was entirely unappetizing.  The fish tacos were slightly better but a Filet-'O'-Fish is more drool-inspiring.    On the positive side, the cornbread wasn't bad and the service was reasonably attentive, but it's not enough to rescue the poor offerings from the kitchen."}
{"text":"In Arizona on vaction, hubby picked this spot out for lunch before a little shopping. I ordered the Jerk Chicken Salad - it packed a lot of flavor! Dressing was fabulous, chicken had a lot of kick to it, crispy tortilla strips, fresh greens. Hubby had the catfish tacos that he was excited about but didn't really  end up loving (not sure why, he didn't really complain but didn't finish his plate...) We enjoyed the chips, salsa sampler and my husband really loved the fresh cornbread.  We just grabbed a couple beers, although I wish I had tried a mixed drink. Pretty solid place, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always a great spot for HH on Friday afternoons on pay day!!  My gfriend and I hit up Z Tejas in Fashion Square at least once a month for a delicious margarita and the best appetizer ever, the tejas trio!  The environment is cozy and dark.   Definitely a good spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times over the years and have always had good experiences.  This time for lunch I had the green chile barbacoa enchiladas and they were delicious.  I also love their cornbread.  The server was very friendly and got my friend's complicated order prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Decent option when in the area. Have eater. Here 3 times over the last year. Recently had the Grilled Ruby Trout salad which was tasty. Wife had the Skillet Apple Cobbler dessert which was decent as well."}
{"text":"I've searched the world over for the perfect  margarita and now look no further-it's here. Aside from liquid heaven, the service is fantastic. The manager rocks too. In the rare times I've had issues with food orders, it's been taken care of far beyond expectation with personal care-so thanks and love ya, Z'Tejas!"}
{"text":"Z'Tejas = num yummy!! I mean the margaritas and cornbread alone are worth coming to visit. I had some pulled pork quesadilla's that were packed with yummy goodness. Lots of pulled pork with the coleslaw. OMG. I could only eat two of the four pieces as I had already filled up on cornbread and chips and salsa. The only thing I was bummed about was that the cornbread can out a little cold for my liking. If could have even been warm I would have been happy, but it did not stop me from eating it. Definitely a great place to come, especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This location is extremely 'group friendly.'  I just made up that term, but it's true... I've been to this Z a handful of times with large groups and I've never been disappointed.  Maybe it's because it's a central location and they've got a private lot for parking... or perhaps it's because of those chambord margaritas? or is it the chips and salsa? or the cornbread?  Whatever the reason, I'm giving this Z a 4 star review because of previous good meals and for the excellent service we had tonight.  I called in the afternoon and had no problem getting a reservation.  Julie who answered the phone was really sweet (always a good sign), and Matt, our server, was extremely personable and attentive.  We had a group of 8 - including a few picky eaters.  We started with chips (which are house-made) and salsa, guacamole, and grilled shrimp & guacamole tostada bites... On top of that, the GM brought us over the beef tostadas and shrimp & pork dumplings - this was a very sweet gesture and much appreciated - we finished every last bite of both!  The dumplings were cooked to a golden brown and really tasty.  The beef tostadas were yummy also; I think these are both new menu items that are being tested - hopefully they will stay since they were both pretty impressive!  After sampling all of that, I still somehow managed to eat my dinner salad with a light lime vinagrette dressing; it was good but nothing special.  (Nothing like their Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad which is my favorite menu item to order when I go to Z for lunch)... And then my 'Grilled Miso Salmon' entree - actually, not as good as I remembered, but tasty nonetheless... other entrees at our table included the halibut special, blackened tuna, porcupine shrimp, seafood enchiladas, and a couple of entree salads.  Everyone was happy and left full - and for just over $30 a head including tip... not bad!  I'll be back to visit this Z again soon for sure... it's a safe bet no matter your reasons, and it's great for groups!  Word of caution: be careful with the chambord margaritas - they dangerously good!"}
{"text":"We had a family of 4 with 2 infants. We came in on a Saturday around 12pm. We sat upstairs in the patio area. We waited 45 minutes to get drinks, we waited another to get chips and salsa. It is now 2pm and we haven't even received our meals. The staff needs a serious upgrade if your servers can't handle 4 tables. Nothing was done in a timely manner and I can't even comment on the food because I never received any. The chips were cold as well"}
{"text":"Gave Z'Tejas a second chance after bad experience at the Chandler location. Z'Tejas used to have excellent service and excellent food!  Things have changed a lot with them over the years. Their food has gone way down in quality and the service is not good. Food is bland as is their salsas.   If at Scottsdale Mall avoid Z'Tejas. Go to Thirsty Lion or Yard House."}
{"text":"This place was great as a dinner for two! We got a seat right away even though it was around 7:30 on a Saturday night. Our server was friendly and the food was really good. It was actually spicy too. Watch out for those margaritas though, they are quite potent! I had one Little Larry (the mini version) and that was more than enough for me in one sitting."}
{"text":"Great salsa, guacamole & queso and chips appetizer just $5 on happy hour special. Very friendly service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Dumplings were very delicious and corn bread was a nice touch. The staff made the experience less then desirable. Just an overall sense of \"we don't care\". It is a place in the mall though. A little of that is to be expected."}
{"text":"Came to Z'Tejas around 3pm for some light bites and really enjoyed it. The staff was super friendly, we happened to be there for happy hour and ordered the Tejas trio and street tacos. Both were delicious. I ordered the skinny cucumber mule and was super impressed, this drink was very unique and extremely refreshing! Really awesome happy hour selection and great prices! Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of visiting the Chandler and Tempe locations multiple times for business dinnersand have never been disappointed. Warm cozy atmosphere, not too loud, good service and now we can talk about the food. Yummy cornbread, margaritas, appetizers and I love the chicken enchiladas!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man this was good. I ordered the seafood enchiladas.. which honestly were nothing like an enchilada, but it was delicious anyway. One of the best means of my trip to Scottsdale recently. My girlfriend had the veggie quesedilla, which was OK, but not spectactular. I would order the seafood enchiladas any day of the week, and I look forward to going back for them."}
{"text":"As the 12 o'clock neared I had lunch with some coworkers. Figured it was appropriate since we had an extended lunch hour. When I use to live in the area z tejas has gone through a minor facelift but still has the same spicy flavors off the menu. This would actually be the first time coming on an non happy hour event and worth it. I love how they serve the famous cornbread as an appetizer with whipped butter. I ordered the chicken burrito off the lunch menu that came with a side of black beans . The flavors of the burrito was a plenty with a slight spicy flavor. I did enjoy the cilantro based flavors mixed with the succulent chicken bites. Next time I return will be for the chambord margarita experience for happy hour !"}
{"text":"Loved the meal, hated the atmosphere. I've been to Z'Tejas before and while I miss the Voodoo tuna terribly, I had my go-to alternate choice - the ruby trout salad. That was after the scrumptious shrimp tostada bites (grilled shrimp on top of avocado on top of a tostada) and a decent, though not extraordinary tortilla soup. I particularly liked the fact that Z'Tejas doesn't scrimp on the trout.  What really made the meal challenging, though, were the screaming kids. Not just one or two, but wherever you looked in the restaurant. True, we ate around 6:30pm on a Saturday, and that was well before the wee ones' bedtimes, but still.... Perhaps the hostess interspersed those with young kids among the quieter diners to balance out the noise level to an even roar throughout the restaurant, but to those who just wanted to have a nice meal and talk, it was more than a bit distracting, annoying, and uncomfortable. Look, I get the fact that Z'Tejas wants to be family friendly, but not everyone thinks a person's kid exercising his developing lungs is special - at least not in a good way.  Here's a radical suggestion. No, I'm not going to suggest barring kids from the restaurant. That would be wrong for the type of restaurant and would subject Z'Tejas to social media flaming. Rather, might I propose that people with kids under 12 be escorted to a section of the restaurant with other kids under 12, preferably where the noise level will be tolerable elsewhere in the establishment? For parents who object, feeling that they ought to be able to be around people who are quieter than they are, so as not to encourage their kids to scream any louder, that's just rude. You made your McDonald's Playland, now lie in it. We are not your siblings, parents, or grandparents. We do not necessarily think all of your kids' antics are adorable, nor do we feel we owe you some special consideration because you chose to have kids with you. We just want to have a nice meal with a reasonable noise level.  Okay, go ahead. Tell me why it is sooooo horrible for me to buy a meal without sustaining hearing loss or why I should think it precious that when you leave your table, it takes a crime scene cleanup crew to pull food, drink, crayons, and other debris off of tables, chairs and carpet (and we can't avoid seeing the disgusting mess or being jostled by the clean team).  Look. You're proud of your kids and/or you want to socialize them. Understood. But can't the restaurant serve one demographic without destroying another's evening?"}
{"text":"We had out-of-town visitors who wanted a good Tex-Mex meal. We knew they would have kids with them, so I didn't hesitate in recommending Z-Tejas, notwithstanding the kids/noise factor we experienced at the PV location (see my less-than-enthusiastic review of that restaurant). This time, they made reservations at Scottsdale Fashion Square for Christmas Eve and invited my daughter and me to join them.  We got there right at the reservation time - 6:30pm - and while we were waiting for our visitors to arrive, the manager came by to say, very apologetically, that they were closing at 7pm for the holiday. I asked if that would allow us enough time to eat and he said if we could just get our order in quickly (presumably so they could begin closing the kitchen), they would not rush us to eat and leave.  Our visitors arrived about 6 minutes later. I had called another restaurant in the meantime and they said they were open until 8. I offered that option, but our visitors said they really wanted to try Z'Tejas.  The experience and food were phenomenal. We had the shrimp tostadas, table-side guacamole, cornbread, fajitas, and ruby trout (salad and non-salad versions). We never felt rushed, though the server was with us very quickly and the food came quickly as well. Soon, we realized we were the only ones left in the restaurant. While the staff did their thing to prepare the restaurant for closing, they were helpful, cheerful, and never tried to rush us. While we did not linger when we were done with our meal, since we knew the staff was finishing up with their closing the restaurant and wanted to head back to their families, we were there until nearly 7:45pm. We thanked the staff profusely and they thanked us cheerfully, we wished each other a happy holiday, and off we went.  Of course, this was a different restaurant and very different circumstances from what we had in PV, but I cannot give enough praise to the first-rate, courteous staff. They helped make the holiday a good one."}
{"text":"L.W. and I stopped here for a quick HH bite before a Yelp Shop Local event.  We were greeted immediately and seated in the back.  It was nice!  Our server came to greet us quickly and took our drink orders.  The drinks came quick and we placed our food order of many appetizers.    Catfish Beignets - They are catfish crusted with cornmeal and fried crisp served with jalapeno tartar sauce.  WOW, these little fried strips of heaven were so so SO GOOD!    Smoked Chicken Quesadilla - Grilled chicken with onions and green peppers, cheese, and salsa stuff.   I am not sure what but both L and I thought it was ah, ok.    Green Chile Shredded Pork Nachos - OMG... These are SO SO good.    Only minor con:  The server had to be reminded to refills our drinks."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the chips and salsa and the mushroom enchiladas. So glad they changed their policy again on the cornbread and chips and salsa. I hope they keep them free. Love the margaritas...definitely the best in town!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten at Z Tejas before and it's usually been good.  But this time was some of the worst service I've ever had.  We waited at least 10 minutes after we were seated before anyone ever stopped by take greet us and take our drink order.  We were hungry so when we ordered the drinks we ordered some nachos.  The waitress took our food order and disappeared for at least 20 minutes.  Then our food showed up- the entree we were going to split because we were having the nachos... So the waitress stops by and asks if everything looks ok and I said \"well the nachos never came so make sure we aren't charged for them\".. She gives me a blank stare and says \"nachos?\"... No apology... And we were never offered anything to make up for it (i.e. Free dessert, take off a charge on our bill...?).  Our entree was cold- but dinner was ruined anyway.  And all of our drinks at the table were empty- never offered refills.  Hopefully the manager is reading this- my receipt said Suzie was our waitress.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"As far as location and overall vibe of Z'Tejas goes- it's a hit. It seems to serve alot of young, attractive people... The outdoor eating and bar is fun- and the big screen TV's are a cool... but the food and service was just a total miss for me.   Unfortunately, the food just didn't have much going on. First, the cornbread is a fun idea and is a nice change to free appetizers- but it was super thick and lacked any real cornbread flavor or consistency. The Catfish Tacos were a whole lot of cabbage and not much else... i literally could not taste the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbage stuffed in. And sadly, the Baked Seafood Enchiladas were another miss- it appeared to be two tortillas covered in sauce and rice with two shrimp inside... i couldn't taste much else and felt i could have taken a better stab at making this meal at home myself =/ (See my pictures to get a better idea)  On top of this, the service was a bit lackluster. There seemed to be a waiter and waitress simultaneously serving us- one taking the order, one getting our drinks, the other bringing out our food, the other with our check-  As confusing as this was, it was difficult for me to get my water refilled and had to flag down the waiters 2-3 times to get their attention.  I'd like to add that during my stay in Phoenix i saw the hottest girls of my entire vacation at Z'Tejas(which was a plus, lol) But seriously, If you're cruising the mall and looking for a quick bite to eat- it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out Z'Tejas, just don't expect to much... i'm sure this place does it's drinks much better =)"}
{"text":"I've been going here (all locations) for years.  I really loved this place, it was my favorite restaurant in AZ. It was my go-to restaurant for out of town guests. But not anymore. Something has really changed over the past year. I've given it a few chances after back-to-back bad experiences and even spoke with the GM on 2 occasions to give constructive criticism. Unfortunately, I think their greatness has just come to an end. Bad service and horrible food is now a pattern. I still have hope but will not be back to see.  *My most recent visits have only been to the Tatum/Shea location"}
{"text":"Would definitely come back for Happy Hour.  Cute/bistro place.  The restaurant layout is pretty cool.  Tri level restaurant with two bars.  The entrance level has a bar that is seated outside with the water mist to keep you cool.  A group of us went there for dinner.  It was 6pm and we had been seated in their regular dining area of the restaurant.  We were about to order an appetizer when the waiter told us we can order off the Happy Hour menu before 630pm!  So excited we all ordered our dinners off the Happy hour menu.   We ordered the trio dip chips thing (chili con queso, salsa, and guacamole).  Perfect to share with 5 people and SO DELISH!.  The Ahi seared tuna was okay.  The fish wasn't too fresh.  And the seasoning was like a sweet soy sauce.  It was weird.   I also had the blacken catfish tacos.  It reminded me of a tortilla sandwich wrap.  It came with this dip that must have been  inspired by  Asian/Southwestern infused flavor with a hint of heat/spice to it.  For $5 bucks and 4 of these mini sandwiches, I could have been full off of this.  I would order this again.   And could come back."}
{"text":"The Fashion Square location is the best one I have been to out of the locations in the valley.  My buddies and I have been there multiple times for day drinking and have never not had a great time.  Like the grammar?  We have always gotten drinks there with very little food, save the cornbread.  I am not a huge cornbread fan, but this cornbread is fantastic.  It always comes out hot with some butter.  Perfect for helping soak up copious amounts of alcohol.  And the alcohol of choice is the chambordrita.  These things are so strong that they limit it to 2 per person.  Somehow on a very long day of drinking my buddy Z had 4 and he was hammered.  We continued drinking after that mind you, but he could hardly stand.  They are tasty, but very cold so go slow.  The food I have had has been decent.  The chips and three different salsas they bring out are good and I have heard the guac is good as well.  I think I have had the green chili enchiladas which were tasty.  I have had some sort of shrimp dish that was palatable as well.  The service and atmosphere has always been above par.  The servers we have had have been personable and attentive.  Sitting on the patio on a spring day or early summer night is the tits."}
{"text":"i've now dropped it to two stars.  look.  15 dollar burrito with no sides.  you've raised your prices?   that makes no sense.  you've now lost a customer who has been coming a lot.   fail."}
{"text":"Aaron is a friendly nice bartender. we always enjoy coming here. food is usually good.  even if the cooks don't know how to make eggs."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. Bloody Mary bar is wonderful  The server was super nice, the food hot fresh delicious.  The prices very reasonable. I know this is a chain but it is still great."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Convinced my sister to try it out. We did some shopping and came back for lunch. We decided to sit on the patio. I made a phone call and came back 10 mins later. And no one even bothered to give us menus or acknowledge us. We had multiple severs pass us and not one bothered to check to see if we needed anything. Finally I walked over to the bar and asked if we could get a server. Now mind you there were two bartenders and two servers for the two other tables on the patio. So you would think someone would come over to greet us. Nope the server walked over to another table that came in after us and then finally walked over to us with zero sense of urgency. Wow really we left. As I was talking to the manager my sister talked to the server who said you had cups I figured you didn't need anything. Really wow you saw us sit down and didn't think we needed anything. If your looking for slow mediocre service go here. Otherwise avoid it."}
{"text":"The smell was horrible! Smelt like sewer when you first walked into the restaurant. I almost didn't want to stay. But I did. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I just feel as a waitress you should be friendly. And she wasn't at all. The appetizers I ordered were amazing though. The food was great."}
{"text":"To be honest, there is nothing bad about this place. I like that it is located in the middle of fashion square mall, sometimes shopping after a margarita can be fun :). This place is great for a quick bite or a nice dinner. Mushroom enchiladas are amazing there!!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, going to dinner here tomorrow night again, love the food.  Great kids menu, food is consistent and staff is nice."}
{"text":"My sisters came to town for a visit and we explored the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall (which is an adventure in itself) and came across this restaurant.  It was a Friday afternoon around 2 p.m. and there was no wait, which isn't surprising for the off time.  The hostess was extremely nice and we had a fun conversation on the way to the table.    The catfish beignets and trio of dips were great appetizers!  If you can only pick one - go for the catfish!  The flank steak my sister ordered was pretty chewy and our least favorite of the things we ordered.  The flavor was excellent, but the chewy factor killed the idea of it.    The southwest chicken that my other sister ordered was excellent.  Cooked perfectly and still juicy it was most definitely the better of the two meals.    Service was great, the food was good (knocked just a touch for the chewy steak), and the atmosphere was festive.  It's a \"must-try\" for any visitor or local looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"Service - we were a bit surprised that we were told they didn't have enough glasses for our party of 14. They did end up rounding enough up. Drinks were good  We got one of each of the appetizers. All the appetizers were great. I'm a detail person and was a bit put off by the not having enough glass comment and having to walk throughout the place to get silverware and plates"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite for lunch.  It's located in the Fashion Square Mall.  That's the worst part about this place, the parking.  It's not an easy in/out.  So don't plan a working lunch here unless you want to deal with it.  My favorite dish here is the Hickory Burger, $10.75.  It's a pretty big Burger and it comes with Steak Fries.  It will fill you up nice.  It's never too busy at lunchtime and we enjoy sitting on the \"patio\" out in the mall....makes for great people watching.  Staff is so/so....lot's of college age kids who's first job serving is here, so the service is inconsistent.  Overall it's A-OK.  Return Factor - 65%"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for years.   Good food and atmosphere.    Handy location...good service."}
{"text":"i recently stopped by for lunch with a group from work. i'm upping the star rating to 4 for three reasons:  1. the sign restricting firearms on the door. i like dining without guns.  2. service was really, really good. when 1 server can handle a table of 16 and make it look easy i'm impressed. 3. my jerk chicken salad was really, really good."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am usually not one to rave over a chain restaurant, but I do really love z-Tejas. Their Mac n cheese is entirely delicious! It's enough to share with a friend, as it has nice slices of chicken breast in it and comes in a little cast iron dish. They also always bring out a dish of fresh made corn bread, any time of the day lunch or dinner. And did I mention they have the BEST raspberry Lemondrop Martini I have ever had in my life?! I still can't stop thinking about it and I had it weeks ago. Yummy!!!! They can get pretty busy on the weekends and the parking lot is shared so it fills up quickly too."}
{"text":"Ordered off of uber eats - and was happy with the order. The Mexican Street tacos, apple pie and chocolate pie were solid and the salsa was amazing and great on the tacos. The jerk chicken salad was also very good. The nachos didn't travel well and were basically one large clump. I would go here as I assume the food would be better right out of the kitchen but overall good effort."}
{"text":"This is probably my preferred option for the cluster of Happy Hours in this small section of Fashion Square.   For one reason: the margaritas. Specifically, the Chambord margaritas. They pump them out of a machine that looks like a soft serve and top them with warm chambord. They don't taste all that strong and then BAM! you find yourself with a big cheesesteak a mile away.   Dangerous is what those things are. And delicious. Deliciously dangerous. Yeah."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service!  I would have given 5 stars if I didn't have to listen to a group of drunk women screaming with joy through out my entire meal.  Some people need to be cut off!  Also, the live music on Friday nights is a little loud for my taste.  But I love the food!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I love ZTejas!  Every time I come in to town I convince every one to go.  I am not a cornbread fan but I absolutely love the corn bread here!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch at Z'Tejas in Tempe yesterday 3/2/17.  Had the Green Chile Barbacoa Enchiladas.  They were ok.  Service was ok as well.  Not very impressed.   :("}
{"text":"Food was not that good. the corn bread was amazing and the Tejas trio was very good,but the CHORIZO-STUFFED PORK TENDERLOIN was not that great and the price is expensive for just 3 pork tenderlions. I would not consider this place to anyone or go back every again"}
{"text":"First time here. Friendly, helpful staff. Ordered from lunch menu. Food is good. Its kinda Mexican. Salsa, not great. It's not bad food. But. It's not authentic Mexican food. Happy hour prices mad this worthwhile."}
{"text":"Love Z'Tejas for fresh Mexican food with a lighter touch. Must have the Shrimp and Guacamole bite size tostadas."}
{"text":"Been here several times for happy hour, and I love it!! I've tried some of their margaritas...and they're all good!   As for the food, I've had their catfish beignets, grilled shrimp and guac tostada bites, street tacos, these dumplings...which were AMAZING!! (Thanks to our waiter's recommendation) and probably some more that I can't remember.  The cornbread is amazing!!!! I would honestly eat the whole thing if I didn't remember that I actually ordered food.   But yes, great food, and the waiters I had here were all so nice, making great conversation, offering suggestions, and always making sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"I am at the Z a lot this time of year---it is the place I always take out of town guests to get a taste of southwestern food that is not the standard fare and there is a patio to enjoy the great weather.  Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, bar none. Also, the best margaritas--my favorite is the house margarita made with chambord, but there is a martini styled one that is great as well.   I have tried everything on the menu in the last several years and there is really not anything I would not suggest trying--but the crispy salmon is one of my favorites. I usually fill up on chips and salsa though and get one of their good dinner sized salads. Still miss their crispy shrimp--maybe one day they will bring it back.  Service is almost always good and quick.  Friday nights are fun--when I get there around 7 most of the happy hour crowd is crawling out and tables open up. I actually think the mix of tourists, left over happy hour crowd and families is a great mix. It loud, casual and laid back. Wish there were more places like it in the area."}
{"text":"I was really looking for some old fashioned good Mexican food. After searching many restaurants, we decided on Z Tejas because it was close to the resort we were staying at. I have to I was pleasantly surprised. Although this is not traditional Mexican food, it was tasty. I ordered the Green chile babacoa enchiladas, the sauce was good, could have done without all the extra foo foo but the enchiladas themselves were very good. My husband ordered the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas which he enjoyed ( a little too much smoke on the chicken for me). Service was good, food was delivered extremely fast and was piping hot. We ordered the appetizer of the bottomless chips and salsa, with 3 different salsas, salsa rojo, salsa verde and another red salsa that was very spicy. All in all this was a good experience."}
{"text":"Ehhh mall Tex Mex.....I had a salad with chicken and avacado that was pretty damn good, some sort of SW Cobb.  Eatin buddy had the quesedillas, which were apparently rather good and chock full of chicken.  The server was just fine, and they bring you cornbread with honey butter not chips, which for me is like sex with no orgasm, but whatever.  Ill take what I can get.  Sad state of affairs in regard to the sex life and my love for chips and salsa.  Arent you glad you read this review???  TMI anyone???"}
{"text":"I guess maybe because they have a great location Z Tejas doesnt think it has too work that hard anymore.  I was there with a large group and we were all extremely disappointed across the board.  The service was really slow (even with the bar being slow) and almost non existent.  It took so long to get drinks that some people were questioning if they had ordered or not.  We had dirty plates and old drinks on our table that we couldnt get rid of even when we piled them up and shoved them all to the corner of the table. The food took even longer.  20+ minutes for shrimp tostada bites and the had clearly been sitting for a bit since the shrimp was cold.  Chicken burritos with minimal chicken-if you ask for more beware you will be charged 8 more bucks for it!!   The cheese quesadilla didnt have enough cheese either.  I was very disappointed and will not return.  The only plus was sitting on the patio.  maybe the service is better during there prime hours but it should be the same all the time, right?"}
{"text":"We use to love coming here for their happy hour, appetizers and their cornbread. Something has changed at the restaurant it is like they are desperate to increase revenue which seems to reflect in the level of service and increase prices. Their signature corn bread is no longer free... which is understandable; but it is just not the same restaurant we use to visit at least 2x a week."}
{"text":"Walk in and the service is mediocre at best. I asked for a spicy margarita and the bartender goes in the back for 5 minutes and comes out and it's not spicy or tasty. Told him to charge me for that one and could he make me another variation. No good. He was trying but overall nice interior design and nice staff but the service is lacking and the drinks and food are average. It's empty for a reason. Too bad because it's a beautiful place inside. They need better service and more engagement and tighten up drink menu. Food is okay if in a rush."}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour, even on Sundays.  However the nachos left a lot to be desired. They had little to no flavor, and there was very little cheese.  I've eaten here before and I really enjoyed that dish, but I won't doing the nachos ever again.  I usually sit at the bar when I go out to eat because you always get a chance to meet interesting people. David, the bartender is a real sweetheart!!  if I wasn't 45 years old, I would have made a move on his young, cute ass!!  Oh yeah, back to the food...not a bad place for Tex-Mex!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Alex,    He is cheerful, efficient, and goes above and beyond to make your dining experience great."}
{"text":"Met cousins from Illinois for lunch last Wed. Sat  outside..lovely day. Kind of a mixed review for me...I had the Diablo Pasta..quite good. Others enjoyed their food as well. Husband had the Almond Joy cheesecake...WONDERFUL..very rich and delish. My cousin had a chocolate cakey thing that he said was great. I was terribly disappointed in the margaritas...small in size..almost tasteless and a very very skimpy portion for the price..better margaritas @ Chili's for goodness sake. Also found the server a bit over the top. I know it's her job to upsell but according to her the margaritas were the best around..all the food was marvelous...just a bit too exuberant for me. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Good and the bad...  The good is beautiful place with nice vibe. Excellent service. Impressive happy hour and appetizers.   But my main dish, the trout had very little taste and I love trout. But again, the sides were great thus the three stars...   I will give it another shot. Just without the trout!"}
{"text":"Ate here our first night visiting Phoenix. Very clean and the fajitas were yummy. Great happy hour and it was hopping! Not bad for a chain."}
{"text":"Not saying this is an elegant Latin Fusion Restaurant with a high end atmosphere and ambiance.  But for the price, amazing waiter service, quality food and cleanliness, this place is a legit Tex-Mex Restaurant.  Great Strawberry Mojito, Green Chile Chicken Barboa Enchiladas, Chips and Salsa...  Ask for Bradley...  Great waiter!"}
{"text":"Not bad. They bring out the cornbread to start with and it's pretty good. Overall the food is good but I'm always hoping for better. Over all, everything is good but not memorable."}
{"text":"Great selection, including healthy items. Be careful if you like mild dishes, though; items tend to be hot."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting this location. Just like the first time, the dinner was great. We all had enchiladas and were pleased, although it was mentioned that the green chili enchiladas could have used more sauce. my real disappointment was the dessert. We ordered the peach cobbler skillet. The first few bites were great but then we started getting bites that tasted like peppers. Our friends who ordered the skillet as well said the same thing. It became apparent that they use the same skillets to make the fajitas as they do to make the dessert. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Simply delicious food...great food and love the ambience as it is in the fashion square mall... I can't get enough of this Mexican food... Also have drink specials during happy hour time... Love it love it love it... You cannot miss this place for its fajitas..."}
{"text":"Back in Phoenix for a conference and excited to leave PHX airport and take a Lyft to Z'Tejas. Found out the Scottsdale location had closed so we needed to make a switch. Fortunately this location was pretty much on the way too so it's all good. There's also a Starbucks within walking distance so the old routine lives on at this location. The patio was nice and sunny so it was a treat to have some warm weather after this horrid Atlanta winter. After arriving we found out that it was tequila Tuesday with lots of drink specials. For food we went with the tableside guac to share and the southwestern pesto pasta with shrimp. I was not expecting the roasted pumpkin seeds in the guac but it's going to be part of my recipe when I make guac at home from now on. As always the experience, atmosphere, food and drink are something to look forward to."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Orange County and was rather disappointed with their service. The hostess was lazy and didn't even seat us. She directed us to outside self seating but didn't check to see if there was any seating.   Once we sat down we we're ignored for 15 minutes before we flagged down a server to help us after he saw us getting up to leave. He tossed the menus at us and quickly took our drink order and walked away in mid sentence.  The food was actually pretty good. That's why they get the 3 stars. Unfortunately. He messed up an order and charged us extra for his mistake. We waited another 10 minutes after our plates were cleared for the check.   All in all I will NOT be going back there again and I doubt my friends will either. Terrible service"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a free appetizer from our  lodging, so thought we would give it a try.  I had to ask our server Stephanie her name (not giving their name is a particular pet peeve of mine,) but she quickly warmed up and gave us individual attention.  She recommended the renowned margaritas, and my wife tried the Paradise Rita and I tried the Chambord Rita.  Both were delicious and refreshing and $1 off due to happy hour.  We had also noticed that wine bottles were half price on Tuesday nights on the way in, and we sprung for the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, and it was crisp and fruity in spite of being a screw top.  For our free appetizer, we got the table side guac, and Stephanie mixed it up at the table, but I noticed she did not use all of the pre-measured salt and pepper and it could have used it.  Still not table side guac up to our expectations.  My wife ordered the habanero chicken pasta, and it was good but the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta were too dry.  I tried the Jack's 5 Cheese macaroni topped with achiote chicken, which was also dry.  The macaroni had bleu, jack, cheddar, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses with bacon, and had a good taste overall but just needed some moistening up.  Served with a skillet of cornbread and honey butter.  As Stephanie was packing up the leftovers for us, two slices of cornbread baptized the table next door, and she brought us a whole cornbread in its place (packed safely we assume in the kitchen!). Overall a great dining experience and we would visit again!"}
{"text":"BFF and I decided to grab food last minute and Z'Tejas was close by so we stopped in to grub.  It was about 7:00 on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy.  Luckily we spotted a free table on the patio and were able to grab it right away.  Our server Alex came over almost immediately, gave us menus and took our drink orders (which was waters all around because she's pregnant and I didn't want to indulge in adult beverages in front of her haha!)  When he brought us our water we told him we wanted to order the Bottomless Chips and Salsa to start with because we were starving and needed something to eat just to be able to focus on ordering real food!  He let us know that the kitchen was slammed and that it would probably take 5-7 minutes for it.  I appreciated that because while we could see it's obviously busy, it's nice when the server sets accurate expectations.  Then he either exceeded our expectations or we have a really bad sense of time passing because it seemed like 2 minutes later he was back with the chips!  Moving on to the entrees...we both ordered the Hickory Burger, hers medium well with everything and sweet potato fries on the side and mine medium rare, no pickles or onions with regular fries.  To be honest I was nervous he wouldn't get it right because he didn't write it down, and while we were ordering the same burger, our orders were completely different.  To my surprise not only did the food come out correctly (My burger really was cooked to medium rare!!  That never happens!!) but it came out quickly too!  It was so delicious I would have waited for it though.  8 oz. burger, barbecue sauce, jalapeno mayonnaise, bacon and two types of cheese on a soft, fluffy bun....I'd describe it more but I fear the drool that's forming in my mouth will short circuit my keyboard so I'll leave it at that.  Oh!  One last thing back to our server as well, he made sure our water glasses were never empty!  One of my pet peeves is always running out of water and never being able to find your server but Alex was always checking with us even though he was literally running around helping all his tables.  Servers at other restaurants who make excuses for poor service by saying that they're \"busy\" should take a lesson from this guy who provided exceptional service in a packed restaurant."}
{"text":"First off I'm extremely disappointed that I just saw the reviews of everybody raving about the corn bread that is brought to you and I didn't get to try it!  A big group and I came here and decided to start off with drinks.  As it was at an odd hour the bartender was our waiter and would not accept two of our girl's IDs due to some new Arizona law that requires Arizona RESIDENTS to renew their license to the horizontal landscape when they turn 21 rather than the vertical (Which we did not know at the time).  Well we are from Texas and that law does not exist in our state.  I understand the bartender is just trying to do his job but make sure you understand whatever memo you have read before you try to enforce a law that does not apply to out of state tourists.  I googled it a bit later and the law ONLY applies to Arizona residents as we did not have any problem anywhere else in the city at all.  Other than that he was friendly and provided very good service as we were a large group and he was all on his own.  We started with the queso which actually comes with guacamole and salsa as well.  I would not quite call their food tex-mex as it is more like Mexican food from Chili's.  Nonetheless I couldn't stop eating the chips and queso.   For my entree I ordered the Texas fried snapper which was very delicious and the sauce on top added the perfect touch.  As far as the rice that comes with it, not so much.  Tasted it and pushed it to the side.  Probably won't be back but it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"OMG, the Texas Ribeye was AMAZING!!!! Also, the chambord margarita is super delicious!!  I love this place."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on Yelp and in other places, I came here expecting margaritas that would make my heart sing Spanish love songs, even though I don't know Spanish.  We chose Cinco de Mayo for our visit, since I wanted an excellent margarita, and we both ordered the 6th st. \"award-winning\" margarita as a starting place.    First, it was tiny.  Second, it had the quality of so many restaurant margaritas, and how else can I describe it other than floor cleaner?  You know, the kind they used to wax the terrazzo floors of your high school cafeteria with.  Tasted like that.  Good margaritas are so easy to make, but almost no one gets them right because they either use crappy bulk mixes or that garbage that comes out of a giant steel container through a gun.  Disappointing.  I was hoping the food would redeem the lousy margarita, but alas, I found no redemption here.  In a word, or three, it was really, really mediocre.  We ordered the chips and salsa, with the three house salsas, and it was decent, but no better than the free stuff you get at most any cheap Mexican restaurant.  Nothing fantastic, but decent.  The cornbread was good, but seemed like a gimmick.  My wife's salad was below average.  Funny, but they mix your salad for you at tableside, which seems odd unless you are at a four-star restaurant from 1980 and they are mixing your Caesar salad in a giant stainless bowl before delivering your Steak Tartare with a side of gout.  I ordered the diablo pasta, thinking it would light my fire and cause me to forget the lousy margarita and order a more expensive one, but el Diablo was nowhere to be found.  Instead, el Diablo sent his less well-known American cousin, Senor Bland.  It wasn't hot in any way, shape or form and in fact didn't taste like anything besides milkfat pretending to be a sauce of some kind.  I ate about three bites and gave up because it was so incredibly tasteless.  The service was good, and I liked both the hostess and our waitress.  I did see a couple at the table next to us walk out because they didn't feel they were being attended to fast enough, but I thought they were just being jerks.    The decor looks as though they bought out one of those stores that sells model home furniture and called it a day, but then most of the houses in Phoenix look like this, so I can't fault them too much for trying to make their clientele feel at home.  This restaurant is mostly for people who want to pretend they like southwestern/Mexican food, but think Chili's is not authentic enough (by the way, Chili's has better margaritas, and that's sad).  Needless to say, I won't be going back.  I can go to the Los Taquitos near my house and eat authentic food and drink a margarita with fresh-squeezed lime juice for half the price, and with way more than twice the taste."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Z-Tejas' restaurant for years. My wife loves the restaurant and I must have had a bad experience at the one in Tempe. I don't remember the reason, but I've always bypass them.  SInce it was three days before Christmas and it was my turn to choose a restaurant, I chose Z-Tejas because we had to return an item to Macy's.  Our server, Crystal, was very polite and keep our glasses full, even checking on us every now and then to see that we were enjoying our meal.  We thought about happy hour, but decided on the full menu. I had the Pepita Crusted Chicken and my wife had the Chicken Enchilada with Black Beans and no rice.  My entree looked very appetizing with cilantro pesto chicken breast sliced in half and ayered with sweet potato hash, spinach, artichokes and mushrooms, served with roasted poblano sauce.  There was too many chopped carrots surrounding the entry  to give it color. But it was tasty. My wife's entree was also delicious and there was a lot of black beans which covered half of the plate. We ended the course with the Multi-berry cobbler served in a cast-iron skillet. It was really sweet and the ice cream helped by cutting the sweetness of the dessert. Now the question is will I go back. I will, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"When my favorite location closed, I kind of forgot about Z Tejas, but seeing the Tatum location at lunchtime on a sweltering afternoon meant we had to stop. Eating out can be problematic for me as I am watching both my carbs and calories. The problem with Z Tejas is the Ancho Fudge Pie starts calling to me while I am still out in the parking lot. With that in mind, I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken salad with a warm bacon dressing (it kinda looks healthy) and  In order to maintain my hydration level,  I started with a blood orange margarita. Cold, refreshing and perfect, I unfortunately didn't remember the camera until my glass was empty. Frankly, I had forgotten about the cornbread, which is my idea of heaven. I had hopes that my husband would not eat the last piece, but he did! I learned you can easily pick up the last crumbs by licking a finger first  so that is why the pan was completely clean. Our meals were great--nicely presented, good tasting and way  too much. My salad was fresh, full of chicken, had just enough dressing and a tangy lump of goat cheese in the middle. As good as this was, I took a third home for later. Unfortunately, at this point, there was just no room for dessert. Great food, great drinks and superb service. Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"The 4 stars are for the Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostado Bites.  These are my all time favorite here.  Perfectly cooked and well done.  Love the kick.   What I don't recommend is the Pepita Crusted Chicken.  Sounds yummy but eh.  With all the flavors in it, you'd think it would be a party in your mouth.  I thought it was all pretty mild with the artichoke hearts being the only thing that stood out.  The sweet potatoes were a bit too hard for my liking so not sure if that is how they should be or they were just undercooked - crunchy. Don't know how the rest of the food is but the tried and true are the Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostado Bites."}
{"text":"This location completely fills my people watching needs. We can sit outside on the patio near the mall entrance and watch all the hustle and bustle of the shoppers without having to be in it all. The service is good and the drinks are great. Give me some queso and some more of that cornbread and I'm set."}
{"text":"Pictures on the menu.  Anytime there are pictures on the menu(exception Asian food) the place has reduced costs and decided to to profitable over serving good food.  This is not the same place I liked 10 years ago.  Maybe its a good stock, but not a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We do love the food and atmosphere at Ztejas and decided to give it another try. So glad we did!! We were lucky enough to be seated in Stephanie's area in the bar and the service we received was top notch. Thank you Stephanie and we will be back to see you soon."}
{"text":"Nothing superb, but certainly nothing bland.  Z'Tejas is a quality Tex-Mex chain that rarely disappoints.  It has that bar vibe, but certainly not the Scottsdale vibe that most of the restaurants in Fashion Square seem to be going for.  My girlfriend and I were in the mall late on Saturday when we realized we hadn't eaten, yet.  We decided on Z'Tejas  because the menu is filled with foods that we both like.  Then again, I don't know how anyone lives in the southwest if they don't like Tex-Mex.  She had the turkey burger, which she enjoyed.  I had the smoked chicken chile relleno.  It was just okay, certainly not close to the best I've ever had.  We also had the table side guacamole and chips.  Awesome!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Also awesome; the corn bread Z'Tejas serves with every meal.  I could eat that all day!  Z'Tejas is another spot inside Fashion Square Mall that I don't think I would ever go out of my way to eat at.  But it certainly is a place you won't go wrong with if you happen to be in the mall and looking for a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff with amazing menu options!   Get the dip trio! (queso, guacamole and salsa)"}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to this place when we first started dating, she worked here when she was in high school and bragged how great it was.  I was immediately obsessed, margaritas are my drinks of choice and the Frusions taste amazing and pack a punch as well. As far as the appetizers I enjoy the Tejas trio and the tostada bites . When it comes to entrees go you can't go wrong with the Jerk Salad, my wife taught me to substitute the Chicken with Ahi. She also got me hooked on the fajitas as well, I'm a chicken guy but the steak ones are tasty as well.  We stopped here on Sunday with my wife's family and my best friend, \"Bubba\" waited on us and was super attentive and accommodating.  We were very impressed with his personalized service.  I'm a little disappointed to hear that the one in south coast plaza closed but despite the new ownership, it's still one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas never fails to impress, tonight's experience was equally satisfying. Z'Tejas has the best frozen margaritas I have ever tasted in my life. My personal favorite is the Patron Fruzion, but be careful these things pack a punch and the policy is to cut you off at 3.  The Tejas Trio is another must. Hand-hacked guacamole, salsa, and cheese dip served in a hot cast iron skillet. I almost always get the Jerk Chicken salad, but I get the seared Ahi instead of chicken.  The fajitas here that have been recently added back to the menu are absolutely amazing. I also love the Barbacoa beef enchiladas with the green chili sauce. I also recommend the chicken tortilla soup which is loaded up with chicken, cheese, and avocados. The also have a Diablo pasta dish which is really good too, it's a jalape√±o cream sauce with chicken over fettuccini noodles.      I've never had an item on the menu I haven't liked. The biggest struggle for me if what to order because everything on the menu is so amazing."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas does not live up to Phoenix Southwest Mexican restaurant standards. The service is horrible, if you get a waiter named Jack ask for another table. No guarantees there either. Even the bussers were nasty. By the way we asked Jack for chips and salsa 5 times got em when we were done eating. If you like high prices, medlocre food, small portions and lousy service this restaurant is for you."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and decided to check it out with a group of people. We were seated quickly and they accommodated my group as well as my daughter who was in her car seat. Our server was not too great as he would forget to bring a drink and check on us at appropriate times, but our food was AMAZING, ambiance was great as we could all chat without overly loud music and had a great dinner. I most definitely will be back! PS I recommend the Baked Seafood Enchilada."}
{"text":"First time here! Great waiter Taylor. The food and restaurant both great! Spoke to John the manager this guy knows customer service. It is nice to know there are still people like Taylor and John out there that take pride in their job!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Happy Hour. It's a bit expensive otherwise but the quality of the food is always outstanding. They also serve fresh corn bread when you arrive and on Sundays have build your own Mimosa or Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine dragged me here saying it was one of her favorite restaurants. Obviously I had high expectations, but they were not completely met.  One big problem which is not necessarily the restaurants fault is cornbread. Z Tejas is a southwestern restaurant and they serve cornbread before your meal. BLEH. I hate cornbread! I don't know why I just think it's nasty!   The Chicken pasta I had was very good, but this restaurant is just not my style. Small menu with nothing that really appealed to me. Good service and nice atmosphere. If you like cornbread ...SIGH..you will probably love this place."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting here today with a group of gals. We got the back room and 2 waiters.  Food was great. I had the street tacos - super yummy! The waiters were perfect. Attentive nd respectful of our meeting. Kept drinks full with minimal interruption.   The menu looked tasty, I'm sure I'll take my husband back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I moved to Phoenix about 3 weeks ago, and decided that we wanted to do a fairly low-key Valentine's Day at a moderately priced restaurant in the area. We checked open table, saw that Z'Tejas still had some openings, and since we had been told by some friends that their food was excellent we decided to make a reservation.  Positives: the food really was great! We loved the chips & salsa appetizer we chose (even though I do find it a little silly that you have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant), loved the complimentary hot cornbread in a skillet, and loved our entrees as well (I got the fajitas, he got the chicken enchiladas). The food was almost better than great, it was exactly what we would have wanted and I find myself already craving it again!  Negatives: It took us fifteen solid minutes to even get a waitress to our table, which I would totally understand if it was super busy, but it wasn't. We were actually surprised at how many open tables we saw given that it was Valentine's Day, and yet we still had to wait. Our waitress was also just not that great once she arrived. She didn't seem to know much about the food or drinks, and seemed a bit flighty.We were also disappointed by the drinks we received. My fiance ordered a Dos Equis draft and they apparently had run out earlier in the evening, so he went with a bottled Dos Equis amber. Not a huge deal, again, I understand completely that things happen, but it was slightly disappointing. I ordered the \"beerita\", which is a margarita with a mini Corona bottle in it. It was okay, but I have absolutely had better. It was supposed to be frozen and it was more melty than anything, which I personally don't think tastes as great with the beer pouring into it.  Overall, I am certain we will be going back, but maybe for a lunch experience with beers rather than a dinner experience with specialty drinks."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to this location and I don't think ill be back.   Margaritas great. Chips, guac great. Cornbread great.  Our server \"Bubba\" was the highlight of the entire night. He seemed to be the only energy in the place. As the other location seems to be always happening we were kinda of shocked about the lack of any kind of vibe.  I ordered a vodka grapefruit and that one they were out of grapefruit so that was a let down.   Not bad , not good."}
{"text":"This place is convenient for lunch while shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square.....because it is in Scottsdale Fashion Square....lol....can't get more convenient than that.  Seriously though....it has a nice atmosphere....you never have to wait (not so far anyway) the staff are friendly , the prices are reasonable and the food is good.  Recommendations include:  Grilled Cilantro Pesto Rubbed Ruby Trout - avocado, tomato relish, served with green chili rice and seasonal vegetables.  Jack's Five Cheese Macaroni and Achiote Chicken - made with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses, finished with toasted bacon gratin.  Hickory Burger - 8oz burger, house made hickory bbq sauce served with jack and cheddar cheese, onions, pickles, bacon and jalapeno mayonnaise.   Seared Sesame Ahi Tuna - made with crushed blackened seasoning,  seared rare, topped with peppercorn vinaigrette, spicy soy mustard and wasabi.  They also have a nice cocktail and wine selection and often have some great specials.   One definite highlight is their delicious cornbread which they bring out first....an awesome warmed, moist and fluffy treat!"}
{"text":"This place is always a great stop! The food is consistency good, love the pan of piping hot corn bread , the shrimp , guacamole appetizers are so yummy! The staff here is also what makes it a regular spot for us.. Friendly , prompt and pretty funny as well! Also, the Saturday and Sunday bloody Mary and mimosa bar is awesome.. They start you off with either vodka or champagne and you get to add all of the accoutrements !"}
{"text":"I visited this Z Tejas a couple of months ago and had a fabulous time. The downstairs was about to close, but they said no problem seating us anyway.  The bartender actually served us and did a great job.  When about to order something he had tried and hadn't liked he gave his input and explained why. Which I appreciate the honesty about a product he didn't feel was up to standard, saving me the time trying it.  My food was hot, and tasted great.  Our server didn't know how I liked my sour cream so he brought out both ways. Cold and the way the chef served it.  My drink was never empty. Service was honest. Food was hot. They did great and I plan to return again. Unfortunately my second visit was less amazing, but still good."}
{"text":"Yummy! Got the street tacos and the seafood enchilada and the chili con quest dip. Also got a chambord margarita which was terrific!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ztejas in quite some time as I used to work here like 15 years ago. My wife was shopping at the mall so I thought I would grab my iPad catch up on the news and have a Margarita. Bellied up to the bar and was greeted by a friendly and smiling bartender asking what I would like. Ordered my favorite from years ago which is the Patron fruit infused frozen margarita. It never used to disappoint still doesn't - great drink.  We were supposed to go to four peaks brewery for lunch but my shopaholic wife was gone too long so we decided to have a bite to eat here. Chips and salsa are really good. The chips are always hot and fresh here and they taste like it. It used to just come with a cup of chipotle salsa if I recall correctly but now comes out with a trio of salsa - habanero, Verde, picante. Good stuff. Whitehead the beef street tacos in any one of them and they were superb. My favorite appetizer here has always been the catfish beignets. I was really disappointed with these as they used to be served crisp and crunchy and these were served moist and almost to the point of sogginess. I literally picked one up and it broke in half by itself it was so flimsy. That was disappointing. I probably would've given four stars but because I know that was a really poor execution it went down to three. Restrooms needed to be attended to as well. Lastly, seriously ... No Wi-Fi?!?! There's a mall connection but it was weak and up having to tether to my cell phone. 2014 and in Scottsdale and no Wi-Fi just seems odd to me."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for reverse happy hour on a Friday at 9. We got their nachos and quesadilla which were both pretty good. They were each $5. The bartender was nice and the food came out fast. My only complaint is that they charged $2 for seltzer water/club soda. Really?!? Unless that's a norm for Arizona?"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at Z'Tejas. I've been eating at this location for several years now. Anytime my in-laws are in the area, they call my husband and I up to go here for dinner. We spent Christmas Eve here two years in a row, and with a party of 11, not one bad dish! Z'Tejas is kid friendly which is a bonus. Leo's Street Tacos are my favorite along with their Skillet Dumplings. The two combined with a small Caesar salad make for a great meal."}
{"text":"I've been a lover of Z'Tejas for several years now but today was blah, at best.  The only thing saving this review from 2 stars, the special of the day, lobster enchiladas!  The waitress was bothered at best, my mom was ordered an ice tea, about 2 minutes after it hit the table we noticed, no ice!  She took our order and left, she brought our check, and left.  We used my birthday coupon and she seemed annoyed!   The service and food both left a bit to be desired, not as all like I remember this location in particular.  The Shea and Tatum location is better by far!"}
{"text":"Brunch was excellent.  Service was attentive.  Make your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bar is a must!  Brunch was served with a choice of warm muffin and fresh fruit before entree was brought out.  Had the apple muffin, warm and moist, carrots, walnuts, raisins and coconut in the muffin was yummy.  Entree was pablano pepper stuffed with jalape√±o bacon and scrambled eggs.  Everything was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Yelper's unite!! You people were not kidding when you said they have an awesome happy hour and margarita's! As I am a huge fan of margarita's and I believe not many places know how to make them right, Z Teja's did not disappoint. I look for a margarita that is swift to knock you right on your ass. There, I admitted that I like to have the tequila kick when I drink. I had one (ok I lied two) of their raspberry swirl margarita's (which I cannot tell you what the hell they called it) that almost looked too pretty to drink. However, I was disappointed in their nachos as I thought they would have all the glorious toppings besides just black bean cheese and lettuce....come on people step up the Mexican. They also had cornbread which was brought out like bread, and I love cornbread but not sure I liked the actual pieces of corn?! New Englanders are not used to our cornbread that way....But I really think this place has its drinks together, and I wouldn't mind going back again sometime...."}
{"text":"Happy hour stop coming back from an appointment in Scottsdale- very glad we did after reading so many great reviews of the food. Excellent appetizers and during happy hour they are $3 off - not 1/2 price but still a good deal. Grilled shrimp & guacamole mini tostadas was heavenly! A+++"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch this week.  The cornbread was fresh out of the oven and tasty.  Chips and Queso were fantastic.  I had the Diablo Pasta with jerk chicken for my entree and loved it.  My lunch guests tried the chicken and steak fajitas and thought they were fantastic!  No margaritas this time but love them!  John the manager was super friendly and helpful.  Great service and great food!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific service, thank you Jacob! The food is excellent as usual, we have been a couple times since moving here. The Pork Chilli Verde appetizer, the Trio & of course the complimentary corn bread. Top notch service, great food, just a tad pricey. But we will be back again."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in their quality of service and their food. The only thing I enjoyed was the chips and salsa.   When I went to open my napkin and use my silverware I was disgusted that there were food chunks all over the \"supposedly\" clean silverware. I immediately lost my appetite and never really finished my food. I showed the waiter the fork and he went to show his manager. The manager was polite and apologized and offered us another drink which I did not have any interest in since one was enough on a Tuesday night. So he offers my a free appetizer for the next time I visit and I accepted that offer. He comes back with the coupon and when I read it I see that the offer for a \"free\" appetizer was not true. It was a coupon for a free one ONLY with the purchase of an entree. I felt that they did not do enough to make up for their mistake and they honestly should have just paid for my meal. I have worked in the customer service industry for years and this situation was very poorly handled."}
{"text":"This is the first bad review I have ever given. I'm quite disappointed that I was pushed to the point that I actually posted a bad review.  We went to this Ztejas for the margaritas. We have been going to this location for years and always enjoyed our visits and food. However, this time I was beyond disappointed. The service has been going down hill lately. Just to give perspective, this was my 3rd visit within 2 weeks, but my only late visit in about 4 months.  At 10pm we were approached after only have arrived at about 9:40pm and told that it was last call. 2 out of the 3 of us ordered 1 more drink. Then, at 10:30pm they took our unfinished food and drinks from us and said they have to \"kick us out because their insurance policy will no longer cover us on the property.\"   This is the most ridiculous thing I've heard in the restaurant industry. Let's just be honest here, they wanted to go home and not want to wait an extra 10-15 minutes for us to finish our food and drinks. Seriously!  I paid a $65 bill and $11 tip for 4 margaritas, some chips and salsa and two bowls of soup, all for 3 people.... It's not like we were there whooping it up for hours.   I'm highly offended by the way we were not even able to finish our $8.50 margaritas that were half full and had not even been there an hour..... then to have our intelligence insulted by telling us the \"insurance\" would not allow them to let us finish our food and drinks is the most   ridiculous thing I've heard in a long time.   In addition, it was my daughter's 21st birthday and all she asked was that she get go try a \"famous ZTejas margarita\".   Not a good experience at all!    I use to love this place but now that they took the reverse happy hour away and literally kick their customers out, it's not likely I'll be back. (I was not aware they closed at 10pm. We would have never chosen ZTejas if we would have thought we would have been treated this way. There is a lot of other places to choose from.)  FYI, anyone that cares, Zips has just as good margaritas,they are less expensive, and they won't literally take your half finished food and drink away from you at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Big fan of this chain. Love the chicken artichoke dish and the voodoo tuna. Recently discovered brunch, I got the quesadilla with tomatillo sauce and it was delicious. My man got the french toast, big, fluffy and tasted like candy.   Now the best part: $3 your choice of vodka and a MAKE YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY BAR!!! Whoohoo! They have everything you can possibly imagine, including 4 different mixes to choose from."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here. We usually manage to do so about once a week. Tequila Tuesday...$4.75 Margarita...need I say more?! The drinks are strong and the appetizers are superb. I would highly recommend trying the Chambord Margarita. Nice raspberry flavored strong frozen margarita. I would especially recommend the Tejas Trio which consists of queso, quacamole, and salsa ! Yum! Also I would recommend the Chile Pork Verde. My boyfriend especially, just can't get enough! Prices are very reasonable too! 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places has sadly lost its charm. The service was very poor. I had to go find my own silverware. If they were busy, I could excuse, but they were not. My husbands food came out about 15 mins before my nacho appetizer. Really.  It's just nachos. Corn bread was good but cold. Think we will be passing on this place in the future."}
{"text":"Wife and I enjoy a night out now and then and Z'tejas is has been on our list of favorites, but tonight our experience was exceptional. We normally arrive early to catch their happy hour and tonight (a Friday night) was no different.   We like to order from the appetizer menu and tonight it was the pork chile verde and the chip/dip trio with a pint of craft beer, excellent as always. But here's what impressed us most this evening:  the service!  I have got to say the service was the best we've ever encountered, exceptionally fast and friendly. This was just what we needed after a stressful week. Thanks Z'tejas!"}
{"text":"Good food plus free EV charging close by!  I love Mexican food and Z Tejas does a wonderful job. I have had Southwest-type salads there several times.  So nice to be able to charge up my EV for free while I'm eating. I was surprised that none of the restaurants in the area promote it."}
{"text":"Cold food. Slow service and was not even busy. Not even a comp for two cold meals. I hate to send back food but really hate eating cold. So was put in a Awkward position.  Manager gave us a \"coupon\" for our next visit. Gave \"coupon\" to the table next to us. Very disappointed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went back last week on Monday night for happy hour. Enjoyed the outdoor patio and the delicious pork nachos. Service was great...very attentive. Thanks to the Z'Tejas Rep for inviting me back to give them another chance. A much better experience this time. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"My first time. Went for lunch on a Saturday with 4 friends. We ordered an the tejas trio app; very good. There was s happy hour menu on the table so I ordered what I thought was a $4.50 draft beer but it wasn't happy hour yet so I was billed $6, no fun. I asked for spinach in my mac n cheese, they accommodated w no extra charge, that was nice. My gf asked why there was no cornbread; I guess they used to serve this free like chips n salsa at a Mexican joint. Server told us that the cornbread was replaced w free chips and salsa, which we never received. When we pointed that out the server tried to song and dance around it rather than apologize and move on. My husband enjoyed his entree, the fajitas, but was disappointed at the volume and the fact that he was up sold without being told. The server had asked if he wanted steak shrimp or chicken or two of the 3, it's extra to have a combo. It's not close enough that we will go back."}
{"text":"The service was really good.  The food wasn't.  The rice tasted like it had been made hours before and kept in a warmer.  It was clumpy and not good.  The rest of the food did not taste like it was freshly prepared.  Very disappointed.  The server was really nice though."}
{"text":"Love Z's! Been going there for years. Great Happy Hour! Awesome prices for HH. Must do the Chambord Margaritas! ZTejas Trio and shrimp tostada bites. If a full dinner is on the agenda I always split the Chicken Mac and Cheese with the kiddo. Perfect portion for us then. PS Cornbread comes with meal. I hope they will eventually open a spot in North Valley!"}
{"text":"im a true foodie so sometimes its hard for me to give anything over 3 stars, i have to visit it more than once. i was on a trip to Phoenix and i went here for happy hour. First the cornbread is simply to die for i searched for the recipe when i got home. the guacamole was okay, mine is usually better. the drinks was just okay i know they are known for their frozen margaritas but mine was  soso. did they get me where i need to be, yes but was it memeorable no. will i go back yes if im in the area and dying of hunger."}
{"text":"I could not believe the insult of a margarita we were given for $10!!! A small glass FULL of nothing but ice. I had the cucumber jalapeno margarita and it tastes like sweet and sour and ice.  That's it. They garnished this with a cucumber slice and two skinny jalapeno sticks.  We also had a regular margarita at the table which was another small glass packed with ice.  One sip and it was the opposite problem all tequila.  The other margarita was a fruit one.. you know the rest of the story on this one. Manager never came by once to see how everything was. If they had, we would of requested new margaritas.  The food was decent, however for $168 on a Sunday afternoon for such absurd margaritas and slow service (not blaming server, I think she had the whole restaurant) and small plates of food wasn't something I would recommend to anyone.  Very disappointing. Was really looking forward to trying your unique restaurant out."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.  Food came out cold and was a little bland.  My dinner companions seems to like their food, but my street tacos were underwhelming."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident and I'm glad we did. It was a perfect day for dining outdoors which is what we did. The waitress brought out freshly baked corn bread and butter....nice touch. I ordered the avocado turkey burger which was huge and delicious. My hubby ordered the steak burrito, I don't think he enjoyed his meal as much as I enjoyed mine.  The only complaint was our table. There is a large round bar underneath the table which makes it impossible to fit your legs comfortably. We don't live anywhere near here, but next time we're in the area we will have lunch."}
{"text":"Sad to say but if I could give this location zero stars I would. I love Z'Tejas food, I usually go to the one on Bethany and I've never had a problem with service or the food. My girlfriend chose the location in Scottsdale for her birthday last Saturday for a party of a little over 13 people. The service was horrible from the beginning. The place was empty, however, our server didn't know if he was splitting our big party with another server or I don't know what exactly but it was a mess! I am assuming since we took up three tables, they thought we were individual guest although we had reservations. Anyway, it took the waiter over 15 minutes to bring our drinks to the main table, however, the other two tables with us already got there drinks within about 5-10 minutes from arriving from the other server. The waiter also spilled a drink on me which was no big deal as everyone makes mistakes. However, he did not apologizes nor did he offer me a napkin. The waiter took another 25 minutes to conduct our order as I guess he forgot all about us or assumed the other waitress in the area who was handling our other two tables took care of it. It actually took one of our guest to get up and flag down a manager to get the rest of our parties drinks and food ordered. When the food arrived, the waiter spilled the tray of food all over my husband, mind you, this was the same guy who spilled the drink on me. He simply apologized but did not bring any napkins or displayed any concern as I'm sure he was irritated. No one came over to apologize at all for any of the craziness going on. FINALLY the other tables already paid out their tabs before us and waited on us to get our checks form our waiter (which took over 20 minutes to arrive). The checks never came for two of the guest at our tables. At this point our entire party of over 13 guest was ready to go and irritated with the horrible and slow service. We left. The manager soon after called the birthday girl who reserved the table to simple explain two checks went unpaid. We paid them no problem. But he did not apologize for the chaos we experienced at his location on his watch. He did not offer anything for the spilled drinks, spilled food, lack of service and just the complete fluster. It was the WORST experience I had and I will never go back to this specific location again just based on the overall customer service experience. The food was good."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food, I had the steak fajitas, tasty and the service was good and fast, thank you"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Food is decent. I like the hibiscus soda and brunch items. Satisfies that Tex-Mex craving.  Service has been very slow every time I've been, but I didn't mind because I wanted to relax with friends.  The cornbread , frozen chambord margarita and ancho chile pie are not to be missed. I mean it! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write a lot about chain restaurants, but this particular Z'Tejas deserves one from me!  I think over Z'Tejas serves up some good eats in general.  I particularly love their cheese dip in their nacho cheese and chip appetizer.  Warm, creamy, and cheesy along with some guacamole pop; great start to the night and I would totally recommend.  They're known for their margaritas, but I felt like a beer so didn't have a chance, but definitely next time!    For entrees my friend and I shot for the Salmon salad, fajitas, and for myself I ordered the Smothered Chicken Burrito.  I rather enjoyed my burrito filled with rice, chicken, cheese, and doused with warm red chile sauce.    However, the love I give here is because of their service.  We had a party of 11 and they did their best to accommodate us on a busy night; even having a server come out to the front of the building taking our drink orders.  Service did not slack all night and that's what I appreciate; plus they were knowledgeable about their food.  I've worked in the food industry all my life and in the end there's never excuses just get it right and Z'Tejas Paradise Valley did! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Definitely the last check I'm signing at Z Tejas. This is the second time I've encountered an allergic reaction at this chain. I have an extreme nut and seafood allergy and I told my servers that. Turns out they thought I said only shellfish and fried my food in the same fryer as tilapia and catfish. This is NOT OKAY. While I am so lucky and grateful that I have Benadryl with me at all times, there are those who are not as prepared and can possibly have even worse reactions. This establishment needs to bump up their health codes and make sure there are allergen free zones in the kitchen. This could save lives. Until I know they can serve me with these high standards, I'm staying far far away."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.    Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (It's probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Group's Houston's or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)    Great salads too.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, but it's a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square.  Dinner for 2 with drinks, about fifty bucks."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have only had great experiences here. Happy hour here is great! A lot of wonderful food and drink specials. The best part of this establishment though is the service. Marty and Kaylee are masters of their craft behind the bar and Alicia is my favorite server!! I recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Just had brunch at Z'Tejas ordered their breakfast enchilada and it was delicious. Just the right amount of spice, I would definitely recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Z Tejas, I find this place constant, the restaurant serves cornbread, as Chris Rock says, \"there's nothing wrong with that.\"    Happy Hour, check out the reverse happy hour its always popular.  The Champagne margarita is strong and taste great for a sweet drink."}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmm............cornbread........the jerk chicken salad is my favorite. So goood. Great margaritas."}
{"text":"Went for my Bday dinner. Nachos were good, margaritas strong. They gave me some chocolate cayenne pie, was amazing!"}
{"text":"Go here if you like your food cold, your card overcharged, your waitress rude, and your customer service idiotic!  My coworkers and I used to go here 3 or 4 times a month for lunch and happy hours (about 10 or so of us each time) and always had wonderful service from the bartenders. One Friday for lunch we sat at a table as it was someone's birthday. Long story short, the waitress -forgot- about our food for over 45 minutes (we were on a work break, keep in mind). The manager SAW THIS HAPPENING and did nothing because, in her words, \"we looked like we were having fun so she didn't want to interrupt\". Thanks Cricket (honest to God that's her name).  She then gave us giftcards (3 of them despite having a party of 10) and trotted away merrily.  On top of our food being atrociously late, myself and another were charged $7 over and when bringing it up to the waitress, she cheerfully said, \"it's okay you're still getting the same food!\" What the eff?   So with our food cold (and 3 of the orders wrong) we went back to the office and I complained on Twitter. Deborah from marketing responded to me with her email and myself and 2 coworkers sent very polite, but detailed emails expressing our displeasure. In response, Deborah found it appropriate to blame it on short staff and said she'd take us out to lunch there.  It's tacky, rude, and awful customer service to send the same generic, premade email to all of us. Second, I'm not an idiot. They weren't short staffed (there was NO ONE in the restaurant), our food was CLEARLY ready on time as it was ridiculously cold when we got it. Finally, why the hell would I want to go back after I just told you how awful it was?  In short, the food here is not worth the absolutely awful service. If you're at Scottsdale mall and want to eat, walk the 10 feet over to the Yard House. Their food, drinks, waitstaff, and customer service are infinitely better. Even go to Culinary Dropout, Kona Grill, or any of the 15 other places around. Don't waste your money (as they'll overcharge you) on a place like this."}
{"text":"My heart sank the moment I realized that my wallet was still at home on the counter right next to the garage door.   I met a colleague for lunch. It was great food, great service and a comfortable environment. The check came and everything was going great until I reached for my wallet. I didnt have it. I thanked my colleague for his company and sent him on his way noting that I wanted to hang out a little longer.   I informed the host at the front door that a manager was needed because I had forgotten my wallet and then I called my wife to get my AMEX number.   To my surprise, the manager walked over and thanked me for my patronage. Encouraged me to come back and then kindly offered to cover the bill on my behalf.   That kind of service deserves 10 stars but because I can only give 5 they get that for sure. This place is simply awesome and this is an experience I will continue to tell people for years to come.   I was already a fan of Z Tejas but now I'm a raving fan!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, a little pricey for what you are getting but still quite nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink break with a friend while shopping on Saturday. We were about 40 minutes too early for happy hour, but thankfully it was still brunch time, and they had a $4 make your own mimosa/bloody mary bar. I went with the mimosa, and they had 3 juice choices--mango, orange juice, and pomegranate mango. They orange juice and mango were tasty, but the mango juice was a little too thick and kind of sank to the bottom. I had never been to Z Tejas for brunch, but they had some really good sounding brunch items on the menu. I will definitely be back to try those.  We were both pretty hungry so we ordered two appetizers, the shrimp tostada bites and the chicken quesadilla. Both were really good, but the shrimp tostada bites were amazing! They are little bite size tostadas topped with fresh tasting guacamole and a good sized shrimp. And of course, we also had cornbread because that is pretty much the best thing about Z-Tejas. I left pretty stuffed. In retrospect, we could have probably just shared one appetizer.  The only thing that left me disappointed was the service. The bartender was friendly but slow, and the hostesses when we came in seemed not to acknowledge us. But if you need a dining break while shopping at Fashion Square, I think Z Tejas is your best choice."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Z tejas, but it IS a chain. It is very good for a chain restaurant, but hardly deserving of 4 or 5 stars. Decent casual southwestern inspired food. Service is is hit and miss, and the food is tasty, but average."}
{"text":"our service is always great!! especially yesterday!! i couldnt decide what kind of spicy cocktail to try ( as i just LOVED the cucumber jalapeno margarita that they unfortunately took off of the menu) and our server offered to ask to see if the bartender would make it for me and he did!!! it made my night, as they are literally my favorite margarita!  i greatly appreciate little things like that! being as i work in fashion square, i enjoy occasionally stopping after work with coworkers for some happy hour food or a cocktail, and i honestly really enjoy the great service and makes me feel confident that my clients i refer there for food will always be receiving to same amazing service!!"}
{"text":"Don't come to Z Tejas without getting one (or two) of their margaritas.  Not only are they extremely strong, they're also delicious.  I think they only allow each person to have three total- that's how strong they are.   You'll usually have to wait a bit for a table at this location. The entrance is in the mall, so it's always packed with shoppers any time of the day or night.  Since I'm a vegetarian, I often have to modify menu items that include meat.  It may sound weird, but I always get the chicken diablo pasta, minus the chicken and I ask them to add their mashed potatoes to it.  They put them right on top of the pasta and for some reason unknown to me, it's delicious. Quite the tasty combo if you will. The server will probably look at you very strangely if you order this, but it's worth it.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wow! I was really blown away by this place! We had never eaten here and are new to the area so we came in thinking it was more of a Qdoba place (I was wearing sweat shorts!). I apologize to everyone who had to witness me in my grubbies. I ordered the Chambord margarita (awesome) and we started with the trio appetizer. Boy was that queso good! I had the shrimp and guacamole bites (good), hubby had the green chili pork enchiladas (excellent), son had the street tacos (good) and daughter had the mushroom enchiladas (excellent). Yes, I know my kids have excellent taste. We will definitely be back and I promise we'll be a little more pleasing to the eye."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever the bartender Alexa was very disrespectful and ignored me the entire time. When I came into the restaurant i tried being friendly and speak to her as I had a really bad morning. She did not  offer me a menu And did not offer me chips and salsa. I had to ask for the menu and she did not want to speak to me the entire time I was there. I thought it's ok maybe she's quiet. Yet no that was not the case. She told me her manager would not serve me ??? I was confused and said I Have not even seen your manager may I speak to him? I literally had already had one of those days. You know the type when you finally sit down you just want to release and speak to another human. All she did was make it worse. I have been to this restaurant before but not had treatment like this. Just ignorance and rude. Than she started  yelling at me when I asked her why did you not even serve me a menu? I had to ask you? She started to yell at me. I'm not sure what made her make the decision to not serve me so I asked the manager and he said I am not sure. Worst treatment ever. they are not even able to explain their reasoning for their actions. Seriously that was my last time going there."}
{"text":"There Happy Hour is great!  1/2 off App's - everything on the app list is amazing - especially the shrimp and catfish taco's!  And they have the MOST amazing marg - it is made with Chambord (sp?) and you are limited to only 3 b/c they are so damn strong!  Wish the crowd was hipper - it seems to be a bunch of old folks - but that could be b/c we go some damn early!  Service is always great - food is always good - and there Berry Cobler will rock your world!  I am going tonight and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Affordable delicious tex-mex in the area. We had the grilled tilapia - it was one of the best pieces of fish we've had in a while. Also had the chicken with spinach artichokes and mushroom - this was pretty good as well! Good happy hour prices and free cornbread before your meal- overall really good!"}
{"text":"Asked for a 20th Century cocktail. The waitress returned to inform me that the bartender had no idea what was even in it. A classic prohibition-era cocktail and you don't know what it is? Time to go back to bartending school. Popping open a beer bottle and making a j√§ger bomb doesn't make you a bartender.  When ordering my meal, I asked that the pico de gallo not be included in my burrito. The waitress told me that is how it comes and it couldn't be left out. And she didn't even attempt to suggest another menu item I could order instead. So apparently we're dealing with frozen pre-made Mexican food here.  Avoid this place at all costs. Their bartenders are little more than beer pourers and their staff won't even inquire with the chef about requested changes to menu items."}
{"text":"Very nice relaxing place. Came on a Sunday and had the Ruby Trout Salad. It was delicious. They bring out delicious corn bread with butter to start you off. Waiter was very courteous  and brought the food out quick. Background music was nice and not loud. Very nice place and affordable."}
{"text":"I'll start by reminding anyone who reads this that I am a VERY picky person as you can see by my reviews! I took a friend here for Sunday brunch for her birthday....I chose Z'Tejas because they have a \"bloody mary\" bar, and I do love my Sunday morning Bloody Mary! We were immediately greeted and seated by a friendly hostess and joined promptly by our server \"Bubba\". I normally dont mention names as not to make anyone feel bad....but with Bubba there's nothing to feel bad about. He greeted us with a super smile and his outgoing personality which made us feel at home instantly! We started, of course, to the bloody mary bar which offered a large variety of hot sauces and condiments.....although I enjoy my bloody marys I really dont know how to make a good one, but with the assistance of several employees who were happy to help, I enjoyed a darn good drink! My problem with the condiments was that most of it looked dried out ex: carrots, celery and pickles. While enjoying our drinks Bubba came to our table to make us the guacamole we ordered, he showed us each ingredient before adding it and a few minutes later we were digging into our guac and chips...yummmmm We shared a \"shrimp omelete\" which had baby shrimp,goat cheese and was very good.  We couldnt decided on the corn bread, morning glory muffin or the fresh fruit, so Bubba, being the excellent server he is brought all 3. The cornbread was fluffy and not at all crumbly which I did not prefer, but it really is just a matter of taste. The omelette came with little potatoe chunks that were well seasoned. Here comes the Con (the 2nd reason they lost points)....we had just started with our appetizer of guac and chips when they came to the table with the main course. We would have preferred to enjoy what was already on the table before bringing more, especially because by the time we got around to the omelette it was not hot. They brought my friend an \"on the house\" birthday desert which was a browine type mixture baked as a pie with a dab of whipped cream on top. The brownie pie is a \"MUST TRY\", it was sweet and decedant and sinful and we loved it! We never had to ask for anything as Bubba visited us frequently to check on things. The atmosphere is comfortable, big and airy and a great place to enjoy a meal or just a cocktail. We WILL be back and I do reccomend you give it a try....and dont forget to ask for \"BUBBA\"... In the meantime.....  Bon' Appetite"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times in the past couple of years as my brother loves coming here. The 1/2 price bottles of wine on Monday and Tuesdays was a nice touch for the holiday season and the service was generally good. We were left at the bar once for quite some time with no server in sight. Our server said something was going on in the restaurant but didn't elaborate. I have to say that I wasn't a big fan of the table side guacamole. It was a cool looking set up, but the flavors were lacking a bit. I had the Mushroom Enchiladas, gluten free style. I really don't get how it differed from the main menu Mushroom Enchiladas and the server couldn't seem to explain this either, but the enchiladas were tasty and I loved the mango salsa. My brother had the seafood enchiladas. I tried a bite and was really disappointed.  The fish tasted fishy which means it probably wasn't really fresh. He didn't care for it either. Everyone at our table raved about the cornbread served in a small skillet at the table but I did not try that. I will probably check out a new place when I come back but it isn't a bad meal and, if you drink enough wine, who would care anyway?"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Z Tejas. Service at this location is always great...all the servers and bartenders are always joking, having fun, smiling and friendly, which creates a fun atmosphere. Eats are consistently well flavored and prepared. Fair drink prices during happy hour!"}
{"text":"3 stars because the service at the Bar made me mad.  I went in with a girlfriend on a Friday at 2p and waited too long to be greeted (obviously, my opinion) and I would not use the word attentive at all to describe the bartender.  I really liked the food, I had the mushroom enchiladas and thought they were awesome! Also, if you go with a margarita add chambord to it for an extra, sweet zing! Yummy food, just disappointed in the Bartender."}
{"text":"Love the cornbread.  Hot and it has pieces of corn in the cornbread.  Great starter snack.   I went with duck tacos, which was a special that day, Sweet and spicy meat with fresh ingredients to cool the spice down. I also enjoyed the Chicken Jerk salad, on the spicy side for me, but I endured the spice since the flavor of the salad was great.   I also enjoyed an afternoon beer with my lunch and it overall is a great lunch experience.  I would dine here again, I went with the waiters suggestions and it turned out great."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas always has above average food and is a great lunch spot. I like all the locations, but I think this one is best for business. I suggest newbies try the Shrimp Guacamole Tostada bites to get started. I have never had a bad meal here, so try anything on the menu.   Their NY Strip at dinner is magnificent."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Tostada Bites and the NY Strip make this place a local favorite. They have a really happening happy hour too and are close to mega shopping opportunities."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was bland. Needless to say Filaburtos, is better. Food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"I am not a harsh grader on Yelp so I have many five star ratings, however I would give this place ten stars as the service and food is that good.  I wasn't expecting much, and did not know about this place, but their cornbread is amazing!  Then I ordered the artichoke mac and cheese chicken, which is seriously in my top 3 for best things I have ordered in my life.  If you come here, order this as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I go to Ztejas for the tasty Chambord Margarita.  I ordered a Achiote chicken chopped salad which included diced avocados,tomatoes,black beans, Cotija cheese,roasted corn, pumpkin seeds, bacon,iceberg and red cabbage,tossed table side with ranch vinaigrette for $12.75. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour recently with friends, we had a table of 6, our server was awesome and very attentive. We didn't want for anything and pretty much kept her on her toes all evening but she rose to the occasion. I had a Chambord Margarita. Actually there was more than one. We had several appetizers, including the tableside guacamole. While it was good, I have never had cotilla cheese on my guac before, so I think I would leave that off in the future. We also had the Green Chile Pork nachos and we all enjoyed those. The queso was tasty but I later realized it likely had flour in it (as a thickening agent) so my bad for not asking about that in advance (I'm gluten intolerant). A friend who is also GF got the Street Tacos and enjoyed them. And another friend got the Flat Top Grilled Quesadillas and she really liked them too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sold Out Taken over by Corporate Idiots. Expect them to be out of business within the year. They aren't serving their signature cornbread anymore, unless of course you want to purchase it.  Regular customer since they opened. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch on a Saturday (ends at 3pm). They also have happy hour on the weekends.  I was most impressed by the house bloody mary $6.75. The mix is made fresh in-house and had a great balance between citrus, horseradish, & spice. But the food was OKAY. Nothing blew my mind away. I was a little disappointed with the guacamole and the salsa. Our server was very attentive!"}
{"text":"I joined my friend there for lunch. She enjoyed the Trout  salad, which she says is her favorite salad!!! I had the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas & WOWZERS was it great. I wish I lived near by so I could return & have it again. Great wine selection & friendly, knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the wild mushroom enchiladas.  Service was uninspired.  Would have given a 4 if the waitress seemed to have any desire to be there..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised when we had lunch there the other day. We were stuck without transportation so had few choices. Sat on the patio and had some really good eating. I had the chicken fried ribeye, which was quite good. My wife and our friend had the chicken-stuffed relleno and were both delighted. The cornbread is quite good as well. The service was friendly and the patio not crowded which meant we could sit and chat for quite a time. A really lovely afternoon."}
{"text":"The Chambord Margaritas here should come with a warning label!  Soooo delicious, but lethal to your sobriety. In fact, the restaurant enforces a strict 2 margarita max, and for good reason!  I happened to finish a third once (handed over by a friend that couldn't handle any more), and we spent a hilarious afternoon walking off the tequila inside Fashion Square, and instigating purchases of each other that were well outside of our budget...but I digress.  Z Tejas has some amazing food and drink options to suit any palate.  From apps (try their tableside guacamole or chili pork verde), to steaks and seafood (grilled miso salmon is amazing), to specialties (santa fe smoked chicken enchiladas, mmmmmmmm).  They also offer gluten free and vegetarian options!  One down side - I asked if they offered mac and cheese, and was told to order the Diablo Pasta....soooooo disappointing, and definitely NOT mac N cheese!  Their hh runs from 3-6:30, so they get mixed marks for that...good that they last past 6, but I'd REALLY prefer them to offer it until 7.    Their atmosphere is pretty laid back and comfortable, while still looking classy and contemporary.  Service has also never been an issue here.  This is one of my favorite happy hour locations, although I don't love that if you want to sit on the 'patio', you are actually basically sitting in a valet garage - not ideal.    I do love their queso dip, and as I stated in the beginning, the chambord margarita is to die for...so I say check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and staff is usually friendly.  I've enjoyed happy hours at the bar as well countless meals (lunch and dinner) over the years inside (cozy) and both sides of the patios.  Friends, family, work, dates... all works here.  Do not expect \"mexican\" fyi - stick to tex-mex definition (blend of Mexican and Southern American).  Great cornbread that comes out pre dinner. I've never been disappointed.  It can be pretty busy on the weekends.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying the service was awesome. We came in on a Thursday evening around 5:30pm. From the hostess, food runners, to our server and what appeared to be a manager, everyone was pleasant and quick to take our order, being out food, refill our drinks, etc. They even brought out the wrong entree to me, and I didn't notice, however they still corrected themselves and brought the actual item I ordered, while letting us keep the incorrect order as well. Service alone is was brought the review up to a three.   The food though... it's alright. For the price point I feel like it's definitely nothing special. It's not horrible it's just super basic. The only thing that stood out for me was the cornbread (first skillet you request is free), that was tasty.   We ordered the Baja fish tacos and the Santa Fe enchilada (minus the sauce).   The enchilada was fine. Beans were meh and the rice had a kick to it, which we weren't fond of.   I was brought the blackened catfish taco appetizer but I didn't know what to expect from my actual order of Baja tacos, so when I heard \"fish tacos\" I just assumed that was it. I began eating them and thought they were alright. Lots of slaw and a little spicy. They were cute little rolls. Not terrible.   Then it was revealed that wasn't what I ordered! Now I feel dumb... but of course I then put aside the catfish and try the Baja fish tacos, which I believe are made with cod. These had some slaw and mango topping, they were ok, I just felt like the flavor combo they were going for didn't actually come out well. I've had much better elsewhere.   Check was around $32 for our two entrees (that we ordered). Of course the extra appetizer was a nice accidental bonus but I still feel for the price, it just didn't deliver.   If you don't care too much about the food, at least there is good service! Not sure that I'll return."}
{"text":"I am so beyond satisfied with this place. They put their own little twist on most of the entr√©e's. We will definitely be regulars at this place."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service however is not. We ordered via Postmates and our salads were delivered in record time. The restaurant forgot the salad dressing, and some other accoutrements we ordered. I called to ask if we could come get the missing items (defeating the purpose of delivery) and upon arrival the manager claimed to have no record of said missing items.  They were rude, unapologetic for overlooking their mistake and we will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Not anything special. The food was just ok as well as the service. We started with the happy hour trio which included salsa, guacamole and queso. The queso was great and had a lot of flavor, as for the salsa and guacamole it was very bland, we hardly ate it. I also ordered the happy hour prickly pear Margarita which was very tasty. The only negative was there was tons of ice and I was finished with it within 5 minutes because there was hardly any actual margarita in the glass. I probably wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"Arizona + Texas + Louisiana = Great flavors of Z'Tejas   This our overall favorite restaurant in AZ. It's out go-to place for after work happy hour and it's also where we bring out-of-town visitors. Z'Tejas is NOT Mexican food. Rather it combines the flavors of the American Southwest in a bold, fresh, imaginative way.   The frozen margaritas are the best in town. Jimmy Buffet would approve. What they lack in size, they more than make up for in strength. These babies pack a punch. Maybe that's why you have to get management's permission to have more than three?   Z is near our house and serve a variety of great food, that's why it's one of our fave places. They sent me a $10 off coupon for my bday. Me and hubby went there for happy hour, had three killer appetizers (shrimp sausage dumplings, green pork chili, and Leo Street tenderloin tacos). Hubby had a margarita (voted PHX best) and I had a diet coke (trying to diet, as if). Total bill with tax and tip was under $19. Of course, bday coupon helped, but still...no wonder this is one our favorite places for food, drink, and value."}
{"text":"Fresh Salmon with grilled veggies were awesome.  Enjoyed the Chile Relleno.  Live music was a treat we didn't expect.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The live music on Fridays totally blows.  I prefer the tempe location. Chambord marg is to die for."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Z'Tejas. Use to go there quite often when it was a new concept, but fickle I am. I'm delighted to say we had a great meal there tonight.  I had forgotten how much I liked the oven fresh cornbread that leads off the meal. I ordered the smothered chicken burrito. It carried some serious heat, which I loved, but I suspect it was more than the kitchen intended. Others in my party opted to share three happy hour appetizer specials. They enjoyed all three.  Our table was located within earshot of the bar. Tuesday?!? night and happy hour was in full swing. Volume increased as the night progressed and drinks multiplied, gradually making conversation at our table a bit challenging. Didn't ruin the meal, but surely didn't add to it either. Obviously, they still have a great happy hour at Z'Tejas. I'd recommend a table well away from that area. Or perhaps just join in the drinking."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner last night at Z.  I usually get the southwestern chicken enchiladas but decided to try something new.  I got the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin.  It had tons of flavor.  They take the tenderloin and roll it up with chorizo sausage and mozzarella cheese.  Then they have this chile cream sauce they put over it.  Just a great dish.  The chipotle salsa and chips  really good as well as you are waiting on your entree.  As usual Z made me leave a happy customer."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for server to come, drinks came another 10min later, ordered Nachos and never came, food was cold.  Z tejas has lost there touch.. Not impressed"}
{"text":"One of my favorites, BEFORE new ownership took over. They got rid of some of the best apps (e.g. dumplings, pork nachos), free cornbread, and great hh deals. I hear the free cornbread is back, but I only go here now if I'm craving the Chambord Margarita."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good food. We love sitting at the bar upstairs inside. Good service and good food. Last time three meat omelette and bacon which was amazing. This time trying the achiote salad vegetarian style. Should be interesting"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  My husband and I decided to try this place out after hearing some good things, and boy am I glad we did! The hostess greeted us cheerily, and sat us on the \"patio\" inside the mall (as opposed to the one they also have outside) as we requested. We put in drink orders and began the task of entertaining our toddler.  Our waiter came by and took our orders. He was just as upbeat as the hostess, which was nice.   I will say, it took an awfully long time to get our street taco appetizer, and our dinners (Z Burger and Hickory Burger) came but a minute later. I can overlook the odd timing though.  Street Tacos...great!  Z Burger... (According to my husband) one of the best burgers ever. (He also added some of the 'sauce' that came with our Street Tacos) Hickory Burger...amazing!  Seriously, two bites in and I knew it was pretty much the best BBQ burger I'd had in years.  My husband also got a regular margarita and said it was very good. Our daughter had some mashed potatoes...I'm not sure what was in them, but they weren't plain...she liked them well enough for a toddler.   I wish I'd had room for dessert but I'd stuffed myself with my burger and just had no room left!  We will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"\"Z\" is my number one happy hour spot!! Every time I go (and I go quite a bit), I come home a happy girl...that's what happy hour is all about right? From their chips and salsa to their MARGARITAS. One of those Chamboard Margs and I'm on cloud nine regardless of how my work week has been. Thanks Z for being my #1 HH spot for so many years."}
{"text":"Z Tejas is solid.  It consistently delivers good food and good service.  I enjoying lunching with clients here and I enjoy coming by later on for cocktails or chambord margs and appetizers.  I chose Z Tejas for my bridesmaid luncheon as well in January -- I agree with Gabi, they are 'group friendly'."}
{"text":"Friend and myself had lunch today at Z Tejas.  It was a very nice lunch, nice d√©cor, very good service, endless refills on our ice teas.  I had the Z Chicken Salad (cilantro pesto chicken, mixed greens, bell peppers, Roma tomatoes, Jack & Cheddar cheese with a sundried tomato basil vinaigrette)  at $12.75 and my friend had the Achiote Chicken chopped salad (iceberg lettuce, avocado, bacon, black beans, Cotija cheese, roasted corn, pepitas, Roma Tomatoes, red cabbage and Ranch vinaigrette at $13.00.  It came with a hot cornbread served in a hot skillet with honey butter on the side.  The portions were very generous and I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"The Frozen Strawberry Margaritas are strong and yummy, just how I like them!  After roaming around Mill Ave., my friend suggested coming over to Z'Tejas because she used to work here. I let her do the ordering since I'm sure she knew all the good stuff. We started off with Strawberry Margaritas and they are really good! It's a great way to get your buzz going since they're strong too. As for appetizers, we got the Tejas Trio, Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings, and the Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostada Bites.   The Tejas Trio was basically your chips and salsa, except it came with guacamole, chile con queso with chorizo and salsa picante. The Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings were spicy shrimp and pork, wrapped in wontons, steamed and seared, served with a sweet ginger soy dipping sauce. These were really good, I loved the sauce that was drizzled over it. The Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostada Bites were tiny little tostada rounds topped with fresh guacamole with marinated grilled shrimp on top. Everything at our table was pretty good and I enjoyed it all even though we only ordered drinks and appetizers.   Even though Z'Tejas is located in college town, the crowd in here was a little bit older. I'd say it was mostly people in their twenties or thirties. It's a pretty big restaurant and it looks like a great place to drink and hang out if you want to get away from the typical college crowd. I think they have great happy hour specials as well."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town. Go with the frozen margarita with chambord, it's by far their best. You also can't go wrong with the Trio appetizer - it's a combination of mild salsa, queso, and guacamole. Additionally, their diablo chicken pasta is pretty tasty - just enough spice to get you through the night! I can't wait to make another trip back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile, but definitely enjoyed our meals and great service from Hallie last night.  We were a party of 4 celebrating a birthday, and I must say we were being a little needy and loud, but our server Hallie handled us perfectly. She was prompt, friendly and had a dry sense of humor that had us laughing every time she came by our table. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was my meal. It was good. Not great. I got the $35 green chilies filet special and it was ok, not great or anything I would order again. The appetizers and everyone else's meals were great! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE happy hours! What's not to love, everything's half off and it's HAPPY hour! =)   Their reverse happy hour is from 9-close and my friend and I have been going here for probably about a year now for their happy hour. We usually come here maybe once every couple weeks and we are never disappointed.   For their drinks, I usually get their house margaritas for happy hour. It's better frozen but I like my margaritas on the rocks. Or sometimes I get a glass of their house wine since I've been an obsessed wine drinker. =P Their margaritas are $1 off & their wines are $2 off.   As far as their happy hour food, they have a pretty big selection of items for happy hour actually. I've tried almost everything on their happy hour menu and love everything. However, my favorite is their street tacos. It comes with a side of their special avocado salsa Verde sauce. I'm not sure what's in it, but it's amazing! My friend and I will usually get like 3 sides of it! lol. Whatever I order there I ALWAYS have to get a side of this special sauce because it's so dam delicious. =)   Their customer service is actually really good. Their staff is really friendly and helpful and have a lot of knowledge about the menu.   The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I've never tried their dinner menu so I can't really review it. Other than that, I really do enjoy their happy hour and it's actually become one of my favorite happy hour spots. =)"}
{"text":"Its a chain, its in a mall and it was busy.  I was prepared for a pretty poor experience.  What we got instead was great food, very attentive service and a wide menu that accommodated our GF and dairy-free needs.    It was a Friday during Lent so we were confined to seafood or veggies.  My wife loved her mushroom enchiladas - probably the best dish we had.  My baked seafood enchiladas defintely gave it a run for the money though.  My son had the diablo pasta with shrimp and finished it before i got a bite.    We were there to watch an NCAA game and enjoyed it thoroughly, with a crowd of folks getting into the game with us.  Much, much better than I expected when I showed up - we'll be looking for these in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place, have been going here for years.  Today's experience was one of the best.  From the hostess, waitress to manager, everyone was friendly and attentive without feeling mechanical or forced.   Food and drinks were delicious.  Thanks to our server Stephanie and the manager Joe."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. We have been to Z Tejas many times. Our waiter Alex gave us exceptional service. He is the reason why I'm writing this review. From start to finish it was the best service we've ever had at a restaurant. Not only was the food absolutely delicious. But we were not rushed to leave either. We usually are rushed to leave at restaurants because of our two-year-old. Alex made us feel completely comfortable. We didn't  didn't realize it was happy hour he told us all about the specials. Reminded us of their brunch specials the next day.  It was such a wonderful experience but I had to write about it."}
{"text":"I was out shopping with two of my coworkers last week when we all commented that we'd been in Phoenix for a week without once having Mexican food!  This was the closest thing we could find to remedy that situation so we plopped ourselves and our bags down at around 6 on a Wednesday.  The place was pretty much empty inside so I was a little confused why our waiter always seemed so busy.  We had to wait quite awhile for our check, but the service wasn't so bad as to diminish the enjoyment of our meal.  We ordered chips and salsa to start and I ordered the mushroom enchiladas and my friends ordered a salad and the mac & cheese.  The chips and salsa were good, we were pleasantly surprised to find out they were half price (our waiter didn't mention that they had happy hour prices on drinks or appetizers!).  My enchiladas were darn tasty, although they were so rich I almost felt like I was eating pasta.  We all left happy and stuffed - I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS!!! The shrimp quacomole dish on the happy hour menu is YUM!!! I  I also had the Ahi tuna app which had this great sauce. Not sure what else was in it. The waiter was super funny and a the patio with the sun shining. Perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for drinks and the Tejas trio before watching a movie. Servers were attentive and took care of us even though we weren't ordering a full meal. I appreciate that!  Z'Tejas is top-of-the-line"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went to lunch yesterday. Service was extremely slow but I was willing to not complain until I saw a ROACH crawling just were we were eating. I told our waitress and asked to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and says \"oh I heard you saw a roach, we sprayed in the morning so thats what happens, I am sure it was just one of the little ones\" i am sorry, but should the size of the roach matter? He never apologized and acted as if having cockroaches at the restaurant is perfectly ok. Never coming back. Id I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Great service. The margarita was amazing. The Bloody Mary bar is affordable for weekend brunch shrimp toastada delicious"}
{"text":"i'd give this place 5 stars if the server had checked on me after my entree was 'dropped' because the steak was flipping delicious.  Could not have asked for a more yummy dinner.  Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Steff has been super amazing she makes it fun to come here big shout out to her. Food was bomb as usual catfish was good margaritas were excellent I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I stop in this location frequently. I have been going to Z'Tejas since the 90's in Las Vegas and happy I can still go to this restaurant. Their Jerk Chicken salad always hits the spot.  What really keeps me coming back to this location is the service. The general manager Mike is amazing! He comes out to your table to make sure everything is as you'd expect. It seems no matter when I go there, Mike is working and looking over the place like he owns it. Ask for him when you dine in."}
{"text":"We had great service and the pork green chile was still as good as I remember(well maybe it was a little too much on the sweet side).    I was sad to see that on a Saturday eve, half of the restaurant was empty.  I used to come here years ago when I was in town and I remember it being higher end, busy and delicious.  Now, it seems like it was bought by someone else or it went too corporate and the quality went down.  Guac was grainy, salsa was too sweet, tortillas weren't yummy fresh like you'd expect in this area.  The Chile relleno had decent flavoring and sauce but the pepper itself wasn't cooked enough. As if they broiled a lump of meat and laid a half cooked pepper on top. The beans and rice were just ok.  In the future, I will probably just order the green chile for take out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Only down side was our bartender seemed to totally not want to be there or talk to us. When we sat down he didn't say a hello how are you, just nodded his head at us to see what we were drinking. But other than that, id still come here"}
{"text":"Great food and on the way home. Gets me in troble every time."}
{"text":"Interesting spots for tex max / New Mexico cuisine. Nothing too special but they do have a few things that are worthy to try and eat. All meals come with free chips and salsa and their signature cornbread with honey butter. They also have a good happy hour daily on drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. They have a great happy hour with great food and drink specials. Also staff is incredible and the manager Justin is always very attentive and really knows the menu and handles the staff and customers very professionally. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Yummmmmy food and great margaritas!  Service was excellent. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good cornbread and the street tacos were awsome."}
{"text":"We happened to stop by here after shopping at the mall. Not usually a fan of mall restraints.  Our server, Anna, went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and made this truly a fun, fun experience.  Hope she is here next time we come back!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place but today, oddly they were short on servers. One very sweet young woman that waited on both the bar and the tables and couldn't get to everyone in a timely fashion. We were going to eat and have another drink but she was busy with others- and when we left we checked with the hostess to be sure that there was just one server...she said yes, and looked at the other hostess standing next to her.  Enuf' said. Noon on a Saturday- two hostess' and one sever for the entire place. Hello?"}
{"text":"With our recent relocation to Scottsdale we were referred to Z'Tejas Grill.   The service was sub par at best and the food was marginal.  We tried the Table side Guacamole with great disappointment.   The salsa is very average as well.   Overall it was a disappointment and we will keep looking."}
{"text":"Food is consistently delicious. Free chips & salsa, great HH, wide menu selections including fish/steak tacos, mushroom or seafood enchiladas, Texas wedge salad (one of nine diff salads!), Chile con queso, ahi ceviche, five cheese Mac & cheese (to die for), steaks, rellenos, and burgers.   Average check price for one adult, consisting of one entree and 2 alcoholic beverages, is $35 before tip. Obviously more if you get apps, more drinks, or dessert.   I never tire of this place. Number one reason I come back so often: the SERVICE. I always sit at the bar and I purposely come on nights when Marti and/or Kailey are working. They make it feel like a small neighborhood joint even though there are several locations. There are so many regulars here; I see the same people every single time I come, no matter the time of day, and Marti & Kailey remember everyone's names, what they eat, & what they drink."}
{"text":"Sad. Our waitress was cool and attentive. The quality of the food and drinks were below average. 10 dollar margaritas in an 8oz glass...  Appetizer trio with queso and guac that were less than ordinary.  Entrees were average."}
{"text":"Used to be one of the most consistent restaurants but time & finances must have finally caught up. Food recently was only ok but took too long to get & service in bar not good. No more complimentary signature corn bread?!"}
{"text":"The place looks great and the staff was great. The food was delicious but I thought the portions were small for what you pay. Wouldn't be a regular, but it is definitely tasty and a great experience. I especially liked the diversity of the menu."}
{"text":"The environment and overall look of the restaurant is great.   I visited Z frequently since I work in an office building next to Fashion Square. The service started to go downhill about a year and a half ago. The overall quality and service is never consistent.  One of the last times I was in the restaurant, a co-worker and I waited for 45 minutes for our food and it still was not out yet. Needless to say, we cancelled the order and went back to the office without any lunch. I did speak with the GM at this location who apologized and gave us a gift certificate. If you are looking for good service and quality, I recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is quickly becoming one of our top \"go to\" breakfast places in town. They've got reasonable prices, the service is always great, and the best part of all is that they've got an amazing brunch menu...and don't even get me started on the cornbread.  It really is like having an extra little meal on the side and it's some of the best cornbread I've ever had the pleasure of slathering butter on and shoving down the gullet. Oh...and did I mention it's free with every meal? Yeah...makes us wanna high five the waitress each time we go there.  A few of our favorite items on the brunch menu are the breakfast quesadilla, bananas foster french toast (very sweet), and eggs benedict.  We also make sure to get the chips and salsa trio with any meal here since their chips are always nice and fresh like they just came out of the oven (or wherever fresh chips come from).  There aren't a ton of items on the brunch menu, but it suffices and never leaves us dissapointed.   The combo of good food and good service here should be the gold standard for chain restaurants...Z'Tejas knows its shit...they have fresh/fun food, and they have wait staff that are personable and always seem enthusiastic about the menu...can't ask for more than that. The only reason Z'Tejas isn't 5 stars is because is doesn't have that jaw dropping 'wow' factor with any of the dishes we've tried yet...it does have the \"mmm...that's realllly good\" factor going on...but not quite the \"Arrrrgggh, I'm gonna have a seizure from overloading my taste buds with too much pleasure\" factor. Still...a great place.   4/5."}
{"text":"I am not sure what has happened to Z'Tejas over the years, but it is not what it used to be.  Everyone used to rave about their food and drinks, not anymore! On Sunday I was with a friend at Fashion Square and we stopped in for a late lunch around 2:30. The hostess did not tell us they use a brunch menu until 3:00 but we found out when we looked at the menu. They offer a few lunch options- none of them being their fish tacos. We ordered a Bloody Mary that was supposed to be spicy and a skinny margarita. The skinny margarita was watered down and dismal, but the Bloody Mary could have started a fire. Waaayy too spicy! Really not consumable at all. Our server was not into being there and disappeared for long periods of time, so the bartender brought my friend a new Mary but it was still too much. We had the trio appy and what a runny mess the queso was. Not presentable at all.  Again our server was not to be found, so we asked the bartender about the queso and she said sometimes it just comes out like that!! By this time it was 3:00 so we could order the fish tacos. What a disappointment. Nothing fresh and the taste was bland. We really should have sent everything back and left, but instead just paid and learned to not return."}
{"text":"Z'Tejas is a margarita orgy. Virtually every imaginable beverage combination has been infused with tequila. Reading through their drinks menu is as intoxicating as the actual drinks.  I happened to be in Scottsdale this past Friday because I was filling in at our branch there. Just like last Friday when the Biltmore office desperately needed me to come by and fill in, this work day was tragically slow. What better way to alleviate my boredom than imbibing at a local establishment? Dani, who is quickly becoming my new post-work drinking buddy, emailed me and suggested Z'Tejas. I'm excited to report that this was an excellent choice.  Dani ordered the Sky Pineapple Vodka and soda. Since there was less than a shot left, they didn't charge her for the cocktail, which is cool and appropriate as I sampled it and couldn't take any alcohol. I ordered the ginger pomogranate margarita. Heavenly!! Truly spectacular!! It was the pefect combination of not-too-sweet and a solid background bite of ginger. It's going to be the cocktail I'm going to attempt to perfect at home, which basically translates to \"I'm going to be spending a lot of nights drunk until I get this right.\" But, I believe in doing my part to help the economy any way possible, and the liquor department at local grocery stores certainly could use the help. Right?  We ordered an appetizer because I knew with a 3 margarita maximum they weren't kidding around with the strength of their drinks. The Tejas Trio was tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa and queso. All were good but the guac was made the way I like it (the way Robert makes it) with solid chunks of avocado and a good amount of jalapeno for that after-burner effect."}
{"text":"Great margaritas! Really great. Strong. Too many will give you a headache though because they don't use the highest grade tequilla or anything. Still, it's a yummy buzz-giver.   The chips and salsa are mediocre, and I assume the food is nothing special either... I haven't eaten anything here though, so I can't judge it on that.   The ambiance is pretty nice - upstairs and downstairs is laid out pretty well and the lighting and furniture is comfortable. It's not too loud in there to have a conversation. They have a few crappy tvs playing basic cable sports usually. The crowd is slightly on the douchy side, but it makes for good people watching because everyone is pretty good looking.  It's a good starting point to have a margarita or two before heading out somewhere fun."}
{"text":"Let's keep this review simple.  EVERYTHING here is fantastic! The cornbread is the best we've ever had! Oh man...the desserts...beyond belief...and the ones' in the skillet are tops! Then the Chambord Margarita's...they limit you to 3 max and for good reason!  All we can say is GO!  We can't visit Scottsdale and NOT hit ZTejas!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night - it was pretty slow - there was no wait.  The one-man band there was alright - though it was a little loud.  It was kind of funny that he sang all cover songs that were all originally sung by females.  I ordered the street tacos, which made me full, but in actuality it wasn't that good - it was a little tasteless.  My SIL ordered the wild mushroom enchilada's which were delicious and what I normally order, but I wanted to try something new - I should've stuck to the enchiladas.    Service was nice.  He was friendly and offered his suggestions when we had a couple of questions.  He refilled our drinks and checked on us often.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"High end Mexican Food at the very nice restaurant.  Ordered the Steak Burrito, Steak Street Tacos and the cornbread.  No chips and salsa unless you order and $.  Hardly anyone in the restaurant but I thought the food was good, we mainly went because we had a gift card and they just closed the majority of the other locations and wanted to use our gift card before we lost out.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food, they need to change the concept to be more casual because this is AZ and people like to go out and eat in tshirts, shorts and sandals."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered Z-Tejas nearly 20 years ago and it WAS amazing! After not having been for a while because we moved across town, we decided to travel the 30 minutes for Mother's Day dinner.   Wow. It is NOT the same place. I don't even know where to start. The service was poor. Very poor. Drink glasses were empty nearly the entire meal. The table wasn't cleared as we finished eating, so it was crowded with dirty and empty dishes and glasses.  And the food. I will confess the dumplings (yeah, they're back) were good. The queso was great. But that was it. They used to provide unlimited cornbread, but now they charge after the first pan. I get that, but even for a table of 5, we were only given one pan of corn bread...cut into four slices. How does that work?  My entree (the stuffed pork tenderloin that I've had numerous times) was OK...but luke warm, and not the amazing entree I'd had in the past. It was a little scorched on the bottom like it had been pre-cooked and then reheated.   The biggest disappointment? The fruit cobbler. It used to be amazing. Like crazy, delicious amazing. This time it literally tasted like a frozen pie that was heated a little and put in a cast iron skillet to serve. It wasn't even hot enough to melt the ice cream. And the amazing sauce that used to come with the? Non-existent. The server told me they had changed the recipe a few times...this wasn't a recipe, it was literally pie smashed into a skillet.   I must be the only person who didn't know how bad the restaurant had become. It was almost empty. Of course the irony is that people were being turned away, being told there weren't tables (maybe the were short staffed?). Well, they can have my table...not sure I will ever be back...which is so sad for me because it used to be my favorite place."}
{"text":"GREAT MARGARTAS!  Still, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants.  If you're looking for really authentic Mexican, don't go here- BUT this place isn't bad if you just want some Mexican cuisine.    I've been here with friends and family and the margaritas always make it a good time.  My food has never been that memorable though."}
{"text":"I don't come here as often as my husband but I love it every time I am here! He always gets the same thing, the Hickory Burger, and claims it's the best...ever! I try something different every time and have never been disappointed. The servers, hosts, and managers are always so polite and attentive. Plus, the restaurant is always clean. The overall experience is always pleasant:)"}
