{"text":"Used to go here when I was a kid and decided to see what it's like now and was not disappointed. Decent price, nice service and awesome pizza. Tons of toppings and really delicious crust and cheese. Will definitely be making this our go to pizza place, happy to switch to a local business from the usual American chain."}
{"text":"Pizza is 10/10 and you get what you want for the price cause it's all in except the kitchen sink... the owner puts all is heart in it and always happy ... Hojy you rock"}
{"text":"Been going to Hojys pretty regularly now. I enjoy their Hawaiian. They always load up the pizza with lots of cheese and toppings I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried a slice of a friend's pie several weeks ago and made a point of ordering from Hojy's the next time the pizza craving hit. In hot weather, my cooking motivation is low so we built our own 5 topping pizza.  Ham, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions and Black Olives = Definitely Ordering Again! Less than $22 for a fully loaded 14 inch pizza.  Hojy's puts a cute circle of pizza dough in the centre of the pie. You taste it and are thankful you didn't order from the chains, it's that fresh breadiness where you can taste the faint sweetness without the abuse of salt for flavor.  Then the toppings are generous and co-mingle under a generous layer of gooey mozzarella. I've been wasting money's at Sammy's lately and will stop immediately and order from here now on.   Can't wait to try more options."}
