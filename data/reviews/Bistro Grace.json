{"text":"Wow! What a great gem in the West Island! My husband and I really enjoyed the food.  Every dish was well presented and it was just the right portions.  Nice relax ambiance. A must try."}
{"text":"Moi et ma conjointe avons été très satisfaits de notre repas au Bistro!  Tout, du cocktail à l'entrée, au plat principal et au dessert, fut parfait.  Le calmar frais et tendre, le tartare de saumon goûteux, les huîtres excellentes et le steak cuit à la perfection.  La tarte au citron en dessert était également excellente.
Mais la qualité de la cuisine n'est rien comparé au service qui était attentionné, efficace, toujours avec un sourire.  On voit que les gens qui sont ici sont contents d'y travailler!  

Un conseil, pour plus de tranquillité arrivez tôt, puisque la plupart des clients se sont présentés vers 19:30-20:00.  Idéal si vous emmenez les enfants (il y a un menu pour eux)!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor and vibe of this hidden gem in the west island. For starters, we had the Salmon Tartare and The Charred Octopus. Both were delicious! The combination of flavours of the grilled squid plate was out of this world! Followed with a very tasty hamburger and delicious fries. My daughter had the Caesar Salad which she just loved. For dessert, we shared the Meyer Lemon Tarte which was outstanding! The portions are generous and the service was impeccable! They also serve a daily cocktail! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Dinner with my wife and a friend this past Saturday and we really enjoyed the evening. The restaurant was busy but everything and everyone were moving smoothly. The waitress was great. Very personable and took the time to explain the specials. We shared the shrimp and chorizo starter. Great start to the evening. For main courses we had the sea bass and the lemon ricotta risotta. Both dishes were great. Portions are quite large so bring your appetite. For dessert we shared the banana cream cheesecake. Delicious! Highly recommend the restaurant. Prices are reasonable. Best part is it's in the neighborhood.

{"text":"We had dinner there last night, what a wonderful surprise considering the location.  I had a hard time believing the reviews but Bistro Grace did not disappoint.  The mussels we both had were succulent and delicious, and came with salad and fries.  Loved the modern vibe and the staff are experienced and helpful.  No complaints.  We will return."}
{"text":"Happy to have this little bistro so close to home :)
Everything I ordered was delicious. Crab cakes are really good and I especially liked the green apple slaw that it came with. I tried the Mac and cheese, beef and salmon tartar. The only thing I wasn't too into was the shredded hard boiled egg on top of the salmon tartar. Tartar was good I just felt like it cheapened the taste of the dish. This was all take out so I will def take time to go dine at the restaurant one day soon.
Hopefully this restaurant sticks around as up to now the only restaurant that has succeeded in this location is Mundo which has grown and is now on St-Charles."}
{"text":"Wow the food here is amazing. Everything was so delicious, you can't find food like this anywhere else in the west island. Also the service from Viola was excellent, she explained everything about the dishes and suggested a great pairing wine. We can't wait to go back with all of our friends!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered different pasta plates, taste was slightly above average, beautifully decorated restaurant and Daniella, our waitress, was excellent."}
{"text":"Very good discovery. Fast service, fresh and good food. You feel the freshness of the ingredients. The staff is friendly i highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on positive reviews that we read and were extremely happy!! We were a party of four and all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were impressed with the outstanding professional service. The restaurant is small but super trendy!! Chef/owner Paulo stopped by our table to make sure all was well which was a really nice touch. We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with great ambiance. Service was polite but very slow. The meals were delicious but overpriced. The slow pace of the meal service cut our appetites and detracted from our overall experience. For a meal at that price point I'd expect much better service."}
{"text":"Nice Resturant the service was good but is a little pricey 
The side salads is not worth $10
The hamburger was great
The salmon fish was excellent 
Limited menu but does change weekly 
We been there a few times and recommend it"}
{"text":"We went there last night we were very pleasantly surprised. Order calmars as entrée were excellent. I had the steak tartare and asked between mild and medium spice was more on the spice side but was very fresh and tasty. My wife had the muscles they were over cooked and hard to get out of the shell. They were tasty but a little hard to eat. The sides were great salad and lots of fries. Large portions bring your appetite. Nice  contemporary décor and the service is excellent. In all a place to go back definitely."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service, very personal. The salmon and beef tartare were both fabulous. The steak, mussels and shrimp mains were excellent as well. Thrilled to have a spot like this in the West Island . Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice menu, pretty good food. Some issues though.
I hesitated between giving this restaurant 3 or 4 stars. Ultimately I chose 4 because the food was good and I'm a sucker for the whole chef being the owner thing. Plus the fact that the resto is named for his daughter is super cute.
I came here to celebrate my mom's birthday with 12 other people. We had the restaurant almost to ourselves. I think our large group was part of the problem. It is a small space, with an open kitchen and only two people cooking. I feel like the experience would have been better if I came here on a date or with a friend or two. We started the meal with an appetizer on the chalkboard on the wall (not on their regular menu). It was fried scallops, shrimp, calamari served with a spicy aioli. Though tasty, the small portion was not worth $18...

We ordered a bunch of dishes: Steak frites, Sirloin, Shrimp, Salmon, Hamburger. Each meal came with either a large portion of fries or seasonal vegetables. I shared the burger and steak frites and both were really well flavoured. The steak was a bit underdone but they took it back and brought it back cooked properly. The veggies and fries were really great.

The issue was that some of the dishes came out early, and then some really late. For example, my dad just got the fries of his steak while my uncle just got the steak. It was a bit irritating as we all would have liked to eat together. The kids meals were served with the appetizers so they awkwardly finished their meals before any of us got ours

They have a great kids menu so that is a major plus for families. 10$ for a meal with fries or veggies, a drink and a dessert. Great value and my little cousins seemed to like their meals. We had the banana cream cheesecake which was excellent. They charged for it even though it was for a birthday but I was told in advance that they don't do anything for birthdays so not a huge deal.

Overall, nice find deep in the west island. A bit expensive but good quality food and unique menu items. Not ideal for groups but I will likely visit again."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN the best restaurant in the West Island. Not overpriced like some of the other good ones. Beautiful decor & nice staff. Plates are very tasty and the plating is beautifully done. This is downtown grade. Went there on a Wed and the place was packed. Definitely need a reservation. Only negative is the location which is not central.... enjoy!!!!"}
