{"text":"I've been going here for a while now, and really love this place. For a pub in Brampton/Caledon border area, it's pretty decent.

I've always stuck with the burgers here, the guy/girl cooking 'em clearly has a taste for detail. Buns are fresh baked daily from Ace Bakery, a very well renowned bakery in the GTA area. Meat is cooked perfectly and obviously freshly formed and cooked. My burger was cooked medium well and has a pinkish hue which is completely normal when using fresh meat.

I got the Avocado Salsa Burger with a Caesar salad and loved it. We paired it with a plate of nachos, which were awful.

The Burgers and sandwiches here are great, but the tacos and nachos just werent it. Overpriced and very small portions for the latin food fare. Stick with the beer and burgers here.

All in all, its a great spot to catch the jays or leafs games. TVs are everywhere here and it has a nightclub with pool tables on the other side of the bar.

##UPDATE##

The bar's been renamed to TJ's Local Bar and Grill, to make it more steak-houseish, but sounds like its being renamed back."}
{"text":"Have almost  become a regular for their half price wings on Mondays. The beer prices are reasonable. I usually go here for lunch when I am stuck up at the Brampton courthouse as well. The burger and fries is decent."}
{"text":"The menu looks great.
I had the cheeseburger because it was advertised as hand smashed.
The burger was not as good as I had hoped it would be, it was overcooked for my taste. I like my burgers to be pink on the inside, this was well past that.
All in all this is a decent restaurant in my opinion. I would go back to try more of menu but I doubt I'd get a burger again."}
{"text":"Wow, how this place has gone downhill.

We went here last week for a few pounds of wings and what an absolute disaster.  First of all, the beer I ordered seemed stale as hell (Sleeman's), to the point I had to order a (gag) Canadian as a second pint just because I couldn't guarantee that any other beers were fresh.

Then onto the wings, which came out severely soggy and undercooked, absolutely mushy on the outside.  But here is the kicker -- the wings tasted and smelled like FISH.  Absolutely disgusting, they must have been using old oil, or worse, frying their wings in the same oil they do their fish and chips in.

These are honestly among the worst wings I've ever had in my life, a massive fall from grace for TJ's which used to be known as some of the best wings in town

I will never return"}
