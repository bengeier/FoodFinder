{"text":"As we say in Japanese: Oishi!!!! 

It's hard to find great sushi - especially in Durham - but Kobo is the exception. I've been going to this restaurant for the past 2 years and I can honestly say that it's some of the best sushi in all of Toronto and the surrounding areas. 

It's AUTHENTIC Japanese food done right! And talk about reasonable: sushi of this quality anywhere else would be 3x the price. This is serious sushi - artistic in it's presentation, incredibly fresh and an outstanding value. You can tell the chef is a pro and it's not your average commercial-grade wanna-be sushi joint. 

Their \"chef selection\" (omakase) of sushi fills you up for only $22. It's top of the line and their scallops an aemebi melt in your mouth! Or get their regular assortment of 13 pieces for only $15! The miso soup is delightful; it's organic and delicately flavoured and especially made for this restaurant. At $3 a bowl it's a perfect start to your meal. I've had a variety of things from hand-made gyoza ($7) to their tempura udon ($13? $12-$15 but I can't quite recall) and I've walked away happy every time.

ps. watch out for the wasabi! It's mind searing!"}
{"text":"It has almost no decor and the service was bad. The price was high and the portion was 50% than most other Japanese restaurants; that made their price even more expensive.  They wouldn't even give you tea and nothing on the menu would include miso soup, not even Bento box. The food quality was so so. 

A Big Rip-Off"}
{"text":"The others reviews of this place are correct.

This restaurant is more expensive, for smaller portions.

And at first glance, the decor inside and outside is not the greatest.

But it's authentic, and fresh.

My husband worked in Markham for years, and misses authentic Asian cuisine, but he has agreed this is the best place Pickering has to offer."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to find an authentic Japanese/sushi restaurant in Pickering (the other few I went to were Korean or Chinese operated), but was pleasantly surprised to have discovered Kobo which is a short distance from my house. The fish is very fresh, though the portions are super small and the sets don't come with salads or soups. So the price ends up being quite expensive for what you are getting, but at least the fish is very fresh and the food is good, so I am willing to pay for that now that I am no longer close to Zen or Nakamori whenever I feel the craving for sushi, which is often!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out in hopes that I could find a closer location for my sushi fix. 

I am not surprised this wouldn't suit my boyfriend and I. I really tried to like this place as reviews seem to speak well. However the food was just awful. The sashimi wasn't fresh at all, definitly been frozen and unfrozen incorrectly several times, the Amaebi wasn't fresh, it had been dosed in salt to I guess preserve it from going bad, the HOTATE was also looking a weird colour and had a sour taste rather than a fresh sweet taste. 

Their sushi rolls no taste. Congee would have had more taste....


 Overall the food was bland and the flavours were missing something all of it. Salad dressing we tried both kinds, that seemed appetizing but were mainly oil base but no flavour.

Only good thing was the tempura and the waiter was nice. 

The prices of this sushi are expensive for the shit quality you get and the freezing cold dining room. 

 After all it is Pickering. The sushi here cannot even compare to the worst AYCE in Markham. And you truly need to go to toronto or Markham to get your fix. 

 Sorry to be harsh but this was so unappetizing and not fresh at all...... we both had mild sickness after eating here."}
{"text":"In the Japanese-food wasteland of Chinese-run Monster Truck McSushi Rolls from Hell (tm) AYCE emporia (with those stupid iPads, God I hate them), is this light at the end of the tunnel.   Kobo Gourmet is Japanese owned and operated!  If you've heard about Zen (formerly in Scarborough, but moved to Markham), Kobo is Zen's cheaper kid brother in Pickering who is (almost) as authentic.  No iPads, no language barriers, no missed orders here.  Just authentic Japanese food (sadly, with some McRolls for the gaijin... if you want those, go over to Dragon Rolls, why are you here wasting Chef Nobu's talent?)

When ordering sushi, to me you either get the Omakase Sushi (meaning a plate of Nigiri, $22) or the Omakase Sashimi (no rice, just fish, $24).  At Zen you'll pay $80 or $90 respectively for these.  So if you're new to REAL sushi but don't want the sticker shock and the drive to Markham, this is the way to go.   And don't go making that Yoda sauce either... you're a grown-up now. Leave Yoda sauce (and the stupid rolls) to the high school kids over at Dragon Rolls.

For appetizers, you can't go wrong with any of it, but i feel Miso soup is a tired old cliche and you see it everywhere.  Change things up and get the Ushio Soup instead, which is a nice large bowl of clear bonito dashi soup stock with shrimps and scallops in it.  Delicious.  If you've had Beef Tataki at any of the AYCE iPad places, get it here and you'll be stunned at the difference in taste, it's like night and day.  The beef is lean, not gristly, and the ginger sauce is perfectly prepared.  The green tea is one of the best I've had in recent memory; only the kind served by Sushi Kaji in Etobicoke was similar.  (and you'll spend $120+ per person to dine there!). For under $3, it's a treat!

Bottom line, Chinese-run \"Japanese\" places (whether AYCE or not) are all crap.  Just the same dozen or so stupid rolls that all taste the same and are not authentic at all (you won't find them at any respectible sushi place in Tokyo).   If you want authentic Japanese food, make sure the place is run by Japanese, and this place is the real deal.    Come here and you'll never want McSushi again, in fact you'll probably be calling Zen to reserve your next food experience!   Welcome to the big leagues!"}
{"text":"Kobo is the best sushi in Durham and possibly one of the best in the GTA.  It is the opposite of cheap all-you-can-eat places.  You pay more, get less, but it's memorable.

The quality of the dishes sushi and the flavours are clearly a notch above anything else.  I believe it is Japanese run, which makes a difference -most sushi restaurants are not.  

Omakase is the \"chef's choice\" and is recommended. They will provide the a mix of sushi of high quality and variety.

The tempura is flavourful and lightly battered, never heavy.

Decor is minimal and outdated, verging on retro.

The service is cold and to the point, like the sushi.

Watch the opening hours, they like to close early and don't arrive for dinner past 8:30PM it may not work so well."}
{"text":"The last time i went to this place, i had ordered pickup, and it wasn't ready when i got there. This time I went, and not only was the food not ready, they said i never ordered food from them. I even showed them the call log, which they admitted was their phone number, and they said that maybe they got the call AND FORGOT. Are you serious? You took my order AND FORGOT IT. I am taking the limited time off I have from work, to go to a place that FORGETS THAT I ORDERED FROM THEM ???? This is absolutely inexcusable."}
{"text":"I've got to say I prefer seated facing the Kitchen. Especially at Japanese restaurants with Japanese staff, the Guys know what I mean.  Half of the pleasure is to watch them gracefully step from the Kitchen to your Table-side with that sunshiny smile that can lighten whatever mood you're in.    2.5 *Star*

\"Maybe I went in with high expectations.\"

Maybe it's the Western-style Bar.  
Maybe it's the clear plastic coverings on the Table.
Maybe it's the Neon Kobo sign.
It made me disoriented slightly.

Price(2.5/5.0) + Decor(2.0/5.0) + Taste(2.5/5.0) + Service(4.0/5.0) = Total(2.5/5.0)

Not a bad Sushi spot in the immediate East-end area but I have car and willing to TRAVEL."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, all-you-can-eat sushi you best look elsewhere.

Truly excellent sushi. The emphasis is on quality and craftsmanship. Don't let the shabby plaza belie the wonders within. This far East you can't beat it for authentic carefully prepared sushi.

Full Disclosure: I worked here over 10 years ago as a server and kitchen helper. I live over an hour away and I still stop in because the sushi really is that good."}
{"text":"2.5 stars 

Kobo Gourmet is a decent Japanese owned Japanese restaurant if you are far out in the East... but definitely not comparable to some of the Japanese sushi place in Toronto. 

Most of the dishes ordered for the night is passable... not bad.. but will I order those again.. not really... and Would I ask my friends to come and try... oh not really... 

The only thing I enjoy is Kobo Omakase Sushi as I am always a sushi fan. Those sushi they serves here at Kobo are bite size which is smallish...the fish are fresh and tasty. 

I am not too crazy about the deco...as I do believe that where you eat does enhances the totally experience... and if I pay Kobo prices, I do expect some ambiance!

The services though really sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"First and most likely last!
Ordered the Beef Bento lunch special and let me start off by saying it tasted blend! The sushi rolls were pinch as well barely any shrimp was  in there. Only thing I enjoyed was the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Great little place in Pickering - my go to sushi place in the neighbourhood. It's not cheap but not as expensive as Zen. Excellent quality sushi and sashimi. 

My favourite is their omakase sushi plate $22 (chefs choice) which features different fish every time so you know they use what's fresh. I have had lobster, scallop and real crab meat. They lightly sear some of the fish or dress them subtly with grated fresh ginger and green onion to give it a different twist. Every bite is different and very tasty. Melts in your mouth.

They also have a lunch sashimi special $12. It's not a lot of food but great as a light lunch. Comes with rice. I usually order miso soup $2 which is also very tasty and tastes home made vs from a mix (pre-made). 

They are closed Mondays and open for dinner only on Sundays. They are closed between 3-5 pm on days they are open to break between lunch and dinner service. I memorized their hours now to avoid being disappointed lol. They are operated by Japanese chef and waitstaff so you know it's authentic. They are friendly too. One time I caught them during their break and instead of turning me away the chef offered to make my order to go. 

The decor is simple - nothing fancy, unpretentious.

I am happy we have this little neighbourhood gem and that I don't have to travel far to have great sushi."}
