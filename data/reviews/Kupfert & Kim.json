{"text":"I went to check out Kupfert & Kim today at First Canadian Place. It was reasonably busy, even at 3pm.  Service was friendly - though it seems like they have a lot of staff behind a very small counter (maybe it was shift change?) It's a very clean looking space, and I like the selection of vegan and gluten-free sweet treats, like stuff from Earth & City, Bunners Bake Shop, and Rawlly Delicious.  I ordered the \"First Canadian\" , and while I've often felt really bored with bowls of vegetables/grains/etc, this one was a great mix of ingredients - tempeh, quinoa,  shredded red and green cabbage, sweet potato, and a flavourful dressing on the side.  They've got a decent selection of milks (soy, almond, coconut, and  rice) for prepared coffee drinks like cappuccino, lattes, etc.  and fresh juices.  Open from 8am to 5pm, they've got breakfast and lunch menus and seem like a great option for meatless, wheatless, fare in the Financial District.  They just opened two weeks ago, so they still seem to be working out all the kinks, and they don't have a (useful) website yet, but as far as the food is concerned - so far so good!"}
{"text":"a while ago, I had their Oaxaca salad. I never like ordering salad when eating out, but really liked the flavor of this. I can understand why this place is popular. The only thing I did not like about the salad was that the kale was a bit gritty/sandy which is exactly why I like to prepare salad myself to make sure it is completely clean...."}
{"text":"they arent open til 1030pm. the hours listed are wrong. I arrived at 8pm on monday evening and they were closed"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and needed a place to eat that was gluten free. Check! This place serves all gluten free and vegan food. Their menu is spectacular, I got two different meals during my time here and both were extremely fresh, flavorful, and presented well - even to go! I also was a big fan of the portions, just enough to fill you up.   I only ordered one drink: matcha tea with almond milk, just the way I like it. When you go to order, you can pick up a menu when you first get in line which is really helpful. It gets crazy crowded at lunch though, I felt squished standing!  I would be so happy if they opened up in Chicago, I'd eat here all the time."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food! I had the cauliflower Tahin bowl and the burger of the day. Both were definitely full of vibrant zesty flavours and very well seasoned.  The prices are very similar to fresh (around 10$/dish) and they serve breakfast options all day long as well!  The place is a bit small however and there is no table service but it's great for take outs !"}
{"text":"Good quality; fresh veggie salads. The salads should have a bit more protein (e.g. beans, tofu) in them though to keep you going more than a couple hours.  Good selection of Stumptown coffee beans."}
{"text":"Good food, appalling customer service. I came into the restaurant around 11:30AM with my sleeping infant in a stroller and decided to stay and eat there since there was room and the music wasn't too loud. I ordered my lunch, sat down, and then I heard the young woman working behind the counter say that she loved the song that was playing and promptly went and cranked up the volume. I then, very apologetically, I asked her if she wouldn't mind turning it down a bit so that my baby wouldn't wake up, and she seemed very irritated with me for asking and said \"sorry, this is the vibe we're going for in here.\"......basically telling me to f**k off and ignoring what I think was a reasonable request. Pretty awful way to treat a customer, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is better than IQ but it lacks good service.   The portions are decent and generous. The tahini bowl is delicious, and so is the Oaxaca. I like the sweets, too, but I find the prices to be excessive! $3 for an energy bite? Come on now!  I hope they'll post the nutritional information on their website soon.   Can we get new options? We are kinda bored of eating the same thing by now. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just to give you a bit of a background, I specialize in nutrition.  Unfortunately, there are misconceptions about what seems to be healthy or nutritious and there are buzz words out there that lead us to believe a dish is nutritious/healthy.  A dish can be organic, gluten-free, natural but that's not enough for a dish to be healthy.  In order for a dish to be considered healthy, it needs to meet the following criteria: - Clean, i.e., no preservatives, unprocessed, no hormones, no pesticides - Contains calories that do not exceed the targeted person's meal calorie range - Contains the right balance of carbs/proteins/fats for the intended person's goals  I ordered a smoothie from Kupfert & Kim and watched how they make them.  Here are my observations:  1. About 1 cup of fruit was dumped into the blender for a single smoothie (too many carbs and sugar!) 2. No protein whatsoever was added in it (just water) 3. Lots of sweetners (dates) 4. Excessive amount of fat (coconut oil, peanutbutter)  I would estimate the smoothie to be at least 600+ calories and I'm being generous here.  Here's how I would modify the smoothie: The average person only needs 300-400 calories a meal/snack. 1. I would limit the berries/fruit to 1/4 cup 2. I would add protein to keep the blood sugar stead  Other meals I've noticed including the Oaxaca which many people on here raves about was reviewed by the Toronto star and analysed in a lab only to find that it's 700 calories.  Sure it meats the clean criteria but it fails to meet the right balance of carbs/proteins/fats intended for the average person (unless you are on a high fat, high carb diet and your goal is to gain weight which most people are not on)  Here's the link to the torontostar review: http://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/nutrition/2013/07/18/are_kupfert_kims_meatless_wheatless_meals_healthy.html  I would only go to Kupfert & Kim for a cheat meal and eat half the portion.  However, for the price, I would actually go to Longo's and pick up a rotisserie grilled 1/4 chicken and some greens from the salad bar where I have control over the amount of dressing."}
{"text":"Poor service.  The lady working cash forgot my order then tried to take my order again because she  forgot she took my order in the first place.  As I was waiting she then passed me a latte that was there before I even ordered.  I asked for another one and she had such a bad attitude and didn't even apologize for her weird behaviour! She even was dropping stuff and almost hit me.  Werid!  I love that place but I'm turned off by this experience"}
{"text":"Sure, you can probably make a fair number of their choices at home, but they do it very well.  Really great place for people with allergies or Celiac.  Surprisingly fast.  Their coffee and mocha were good too.  Throw in a friendly, knowledgeable staff and you get a great customer experience!"}
{"text":"Sucks! Bland and over priced. The Tempeh is horrid. However, the dressing did have a lot of flavour. Unfortunately, it tasted disgusting too. Worst!"}
{"text":"They have most  healthiest and less sweet banana bread.  They have great salad.   I love their waffle"}
{"text":"I don't usually frequent vegan and gluten-free restaurants, because I am neither vegan nor gluten intolerant. Yet, K&K is actually really good. I've had the Curry Bowl and the Cauliflower Tahini a few times and would happily have them again. But, my favorite thing on the menu has to be the waffle and ice cream. A vegan and GF waffle and ice cream you say? How could that taste good? I don't really know, but it works and because it comes from K&K I don't feel unhealthy eating it (even better)."}
{"text":"They are not gluten free. they have received so much press and advertising as a \"gluten free\" provider(and that all of her menu is gluten free) but none of the ingredients they actually use are gluten free. I had reached out to their customer service line many many times and they were evasive and said yes we are gluten free- the whole menu is. After a year, a friend contacted them again and their story switched to \"wheat free\"  and if you are gluten intolerant or sensitive don't eat here.  Well with further probing, it was revealed that their main supplier sells mostly grains and wheats... so that kind of eliminates the whole we are wheatless part. So now its neither wheat free neither gluten free.  I guess what i don't understand is that that their model is based on providing wheat free  vegan and gluten free food. I don't understand why they would mislead customers who have sensitivities, intolerances etc.  So who is the kupfert and kim wheat free food for then? The concept was so amazing- to have a dedicated vegan and gluten free fast food place ..... but why then go use ingredients that aren't gluten free and exclude the very people that chain is supposed to include? And how about everyone else who may be doing it for just good health and aren't allergic? well- you just bought a salad full of wheat ingredients and double the price of pumpernickels because this chain jumped on the trendy gluten free bandwagon to make money."}
{"text":"Love this place. So sad I don't work down town anymore. This city should take a note from K&K's book and offer more vegan and healthy food options."}
{"text":"Best Kale Salad.  It's called the Wahaka.  Has brown rice,  beans,  corn,  salsa and guacamole and nachos.  Must out some of the green hot sauce on top.  Have this for lunch once a week.  Very delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Love all the wheat free & healthy options offered at Kupfert & Kim.   I understand good ingredients cost more but I just wish it was a little more affordable!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the coffee, 2.5 stars for service and food. I needed to grab a quick bite for breakfast so stopped by the FCP location. I've seen line-ups for lunch in the past so thought it would be worth checking out.  The coffee was great - it's nice to take a break and treat your tastebuds to something that isn't starbucks or tim hortons. =) I got a small almond milk latte and it was perfect. Service was really bleh... both employees just seemed so unhappy to be there. =( Also, there were two types of muffins to choose from and I got the wrong one. Upsetting because the banana-cacao one I ended up with wasn't brown because of chocolatey-goodness... nope, it was basically borderline burnt. The entire outside of the muffin was a thick, chewy brown crust with a hint of burnt flavour. Sigh.  Will definitely go back for the coffee and maybe attempt lunch but for +$8, won't be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went on a bit if wild goose chase to find this place.  I went in the wrong building but used the path to find it.  There was no line during lunch rush which was surprising.  I had the Oaxaca salad and the Green juice. Very filling for the price and portion size.  Will be back for a smoothie bowl in the near future."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE K&K! A bit pricy but you definitely get what you pay for. Food is healthy, good quality and the portions are just right. I've tried most of their bowls, they're all good but the First Canadian Bowl is my favorite. Super convenient location. Casual and relaxing atmosphere as opposed to the city crowd. They are on Ritual too!"}
{"text":"Kupfert & Kim ordered your Paleo Box at the First Canadian place location, got back to my office and opened it and no KALE! Just leaf lettuce....if you run out of ingredients please kindly let your customers know before ordering a $13 lunch! Disappointed in the quality of food for the price. The Sunflower seed balls were also hard as a rock. Ordered at NOON on 1/10/2016."}
{"text":"Underwhelmimg. Had one of the burgers... was cold, and not tasty at all. The staff also seemed too busy talking to care about patrons. The ambience is super nice, just wish the other two qualities were up to par."}
{"text":"Had the Harvey's super salad.  It was pretty freaking delicious. I didn't leave feeling full but I did leave feeling satisfied and clean.  Only reason it's not a five star was because it didn't have a couple of items I originally wanted that were on the menu.  Will definitely come back. Preferably, when it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Bad service - they ran out of tofu that goes in their special miso seaweed soup bowl.  Offered me random protein items from their food inventory...  black beans, tempeh etc - all these things didn't go with that specific soup.  I declined them and asked for a discount /price adjustment since the soup was missing the protein (Tofu) as advertised on their menu.  The manager on duty at the time said in a very loud patronizing voice - we do not provide discounts on our soup and have no way of doing so -  she was talking to me like I was trying to scam a \"discount\".   The point being is you did not have the ingredients advertised and wanted to charge me the same price - the substitutes you offered were not appropriate for that soup at all - you should adjust the price.    I indicated that is not the way you run a business and went down the street to get soup.  The manager running this place is inflexible and arrogant.   Good luck!"}
{"text":"Overall K &K is amazing for anyone with alternative diets or simply people who want a healthy choice within the food court frenzy.  I recommend checking out the full service Kupfert & Kim location in the Standard Life Building. It has a larger menu and the 1st Canadian Place location gets a lot of traffic and runs out of items a lot. I also find the staff at the Standard Life Building location so friendly I go out of my way to order food there. You can never go wrong with the Big Kim Burger. I am absolutely addicted to it. It's worth every penny. Everything on their breakfast menu is superb. I typically lean towards the chia pudding and steel cut oats. Their muffins and cookies are delicious. The creators of this place have really thought through ingredients and providing healthy food to us humans. Thank you K & K!!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of dirt in my food today - I think they forgot to wash the salad?"}
{"text":"I'd rather rip my heart out with my bare hands than go back there again.  The noise level is just atrocious - from the LOUD music to the LOUDER blenders to the LOUDEST shouting between patrons trying desperately to communicate with each other over the din.  No food in the world is worth exposing oneself to this noxious environment.  There should be a surgeon-general warning posted on the door:  WARNING: stupid people inside!"}
{"text":"Went to Kupfert and Kim today. I had a hard time choosing between the overwhelming three (yes 3!) options on the box menu. After reviewing the ingredients which consisted of an assortment of fancily named green, white and pink vegetables, I decided to go with the First Canadian, and my friend went with the Kim. I don't know if the names have to do anything with what is actually served, but if that was the case then I'd have to rename them Not-the-First-Canadian to still be Hungry after eating, and KIM (abbreviated for keep it moving). But I should add, that all options are vegan and gluten free, but I guess they forgot to also mention they are taste-free as well. Next time I have $11 to spare for lunch and a friend suggest going to K & K, I'm just going to play two games of Lotto Max with an Encore, and starve myself until dinner."}
{"text":"This listing is only for their First Canadian Place location but really it applies to all three 4 of their current locations which (in case you don't know) are:  * First Canadian Place (first location) * Sunlife Financial Tower (most comprehensive menu with full breakfast menu) * Brookfield Place * Waterpark Place  If you are looking for healthy food-intolerant friendly options in the PATH this place fits the bill.  As their tagline suggest all their offerings are vegan and gluten-free.  With a focus on fresh, whole foods you will be left feeling fueled rather than gorged   Their selection, especially in their new locations, are quite comprehensive. Covering breakfast, lunch and even dessert.   To my knowledge they are the only place in Toronto to offer espresso-based drinks brewed from Stumptown beans. Which makes for some damn tasty coffee. Coconut milk and almond milk AND unsweetened almond milk are also available at no extra charge which makes this gal one happy camper.  My only woe for this place is the price... I can see why some would think it's ludicrous for paying more than $10 for what is essentially a salad. But when I'm in pinch and find myself without a packed lunch this place is always my top pick."}
{"text":"This place is amazing - wish we had one in the Bay area!  My fiancé and I were in town visiting his family, and we were looking for a brunch spot that had vegan options.  We got the oatmeal, waffle with coconut cashew cream, and a green smoothie. The waffle was absolutely incredible and I wish I could eat it for breakfast every day!  Everything was incredibly fresh, light, and delicious.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I Love Kim's and I always grab lunch whenever I can from any one of their locations (Sunlife, MTTCC, First Canadian). However today I found a ROTTEN sweet potato in my food! The felafel balls were also much smaller. (got the Paleo) Disgusted and saddened. Is the quality dropping? This was at the first Canadian location, also the sweet potato was not warm like the other location in the sunlife bldg provides.   If I'm paying $10+ for my lunch I better not get a ROTTEN pc in my food!   Dislike First Canadian location.  I'm going to the sunlife or MTCC locations which always make it seem perfect.  #feelingsquirmish"}
{"text":"I ordered the paleo salad, but came missing the hemp balls....don't appreciate having to pay for something I'm not getting, to the  guy with glasses at the st. Andrew location assembling my salad, focus on your job dude!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I'm absolutely addicted to Dan's salad.  With only 4 lunch options, you'd think I'd mix it up and try them all (which I have), but every time I get in the line-up (and believe me......that IS every time!) I end up ordering Dan's salad.  It's just sooooo good!  Four stars due to the aforementioned perpetual line-ups and the prices.  If not for the $11 price tag for the salad, I'd definitely eat here more often than once a week."}
{"text":"\"What toppings do you want on the oats?\" asks a staff member to the suited investment banker in front of me. \"Everything...but what's that over there?\" he asks back. \"Hemp seeds...\"  My \"flexitarianism\" has been elevated to a whole new level with this place. Watching them bring hemp seeds and chia to Bay Street suited folk is somewhat amusing. What isn't amusing is the consistently delicious and filling food. There are three breakfast options, four lunch options, and a small number of snacks. You could run out of new things to order quickly, but I've had 4 of the 7 options now and I've probably been there close to 8 times, so any one can be addictive (and trust me, they are).  While iQ Foodco is bringing quinoa and tofu to the masses, K&K is a step above - numerous organic and unique ingredients are in the dishes, like rainbow radish,  microgreens, and tempeh (in addition to quinoa and tofu)...this is the real deal for anyone who is committed to or wants for a single meal in a meatless, wheatless, and organic style. The entire menu is actually vegan and gluten free, for those who need that, but I'd recommend it to anyone who is health-conscious.  K&K errs in two places - 1) the wait is long at most hours. This could be mitigated in part by more preparation. 3 of 4 lunch boxes have rice or quinoa...they could easily start putting these ingredients in the boxes in advance (or even make the boxes as the rush arrives in anticipation as only the rice and quinoa are meant to be warm). This can be annoying. 2) Prices for the breakfast and snacks are high. I find the lunches ($11 with tax) to be fair value and also better value than iQ but $3.75 for a little two-bite ball type snack, even if healthy and organic is a bit much.  But the food is consistently solid, healthy, and unique. A great find."}
{"text":"Good spot! Nice variety of vegetables and the produce is fresh. It's tasty and easy, though quite expensive."}
{"text":"great food, even better coffee.   The Kim lunch box is absolutely delicious. It might be that Almond-chili-lime sauce or perhaps the braised cabbage and spicy tofu, but either way it's exactly what I crave for lunch and I always have left overs to bring home to my boyfriend; every meal is incredibly filling and worth the price.   Love the espresso, especially as latte made with almond milk, and the Earth & City brownie is extremely addicting so be careful, you might not get just one."}
{"text":"I tried this place this morning for breakfast and was really, really impressed.  First off, their Americano was SUPERB. Rich, but not overkill strong. Just perfect. I will definitely be adding this place to my favourite coffee joints. If only they were open on weekends! It's also worth noting that, although the food in K&K is very pricey, the same cannot be said for coffee. 2.65 for an Americano is not bad at all. Certainly not for the quality of espresso you get here.  I also had the granola with all regular toppings plus soy milk. Kept me full for hours and just gave me that hard-to-describe-but-definitely-very-real ''healthy'' feeling. It was also really tasty and the variety of toppings was superb! Every bite was a different texture, different level of sweetness, different overall taste. Great kickstart to the day!  The line-up moved very fast thanks to the speedy, friendly and helpful staff.   I'm not sure, as a dairy-consuming carnivore, that there's enough variety on the overall menu to keep me coming back regularly for the food, but I'll definitely treat myself here occasionally for brekkie/lunch, and will most definitely be returning often for that americano!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for on the go people who want a filling lunch that doesnt put them to sleep.The price is worth it when you consider the ingredients and the artisan sauces. Everything on the menue is amazing and the green juice can easily be a lunch subsitute."}
{"text":"This place is worth the long line up! Not only are the meals wheatless and meatless, they are surprisingly filling. I have had both the Oaxaca and the Season 01 salad here and they are great!  It is a nice change from a regular salad. This is a great place to go for a healthy lunch and not feel guilty for eating out. It is on the pricy side but definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan place. All food is super delicious made from prime ingredients. Love their healthy desserts too.  Great prices and setting."}
{"text":"Meat free and wheat free lunch boxes that taste good! I do eat meat and couldn't find a takeaway meal that was meat free, but also tasted good and is filling. Look no further than K&K. Wahaca and First Canadian are my favorites. The green smoothies are also super delicious."}
{"text":"I would declare this place to have the most unique and flavourful food in the PATH for lunch. 90% of the competition serves the same things (chicken, bread, tomatoes, cucumber etc...). This place has things like quinoa, bok choy, edamame, yams and lots more. It all works well together, tastes great and feels healthy. Good portions. Highly recommended for vegetarians and non-veg alike."}
{"text":"\"Which one will fill me up the most?\" I asked, \"definitely the Oaxaca\" the cashier replied in his Aussie accent. I'm a bit of a newb to gluten free, vegan food, but I know enough to ask that question. Happy to say I'm mid way through my box lunch and I'm feeling pretty full actually. That's not to say I won't grab a Big Mac in 3 hours, but at least I won't grab one on the way home.  This place is fresh, pretty healthy, green, and not too expensive. I give it a thumbs up. Toronto needs more of this."}
{"text":"Love their creative take on vegetarian and gluten-free food. I can feel good about eating here. Good array of choices on the menu and the price point is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"At 6pm on a Monday night there wasn't a line up at all. I really enjoyed the daily burger - it had the texture of a falafel, and was made of chia seeds, various nuts and basically a ton of protein. It came with a side of salad and baked yams, which made the meal super filling. Total came to around $13, so it is on the pricey side, but it's definitely something worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Found this place through Social Media and any time I'm near it's a must have. The waffle, the Paleo K&K bowl are both incredible. The roasted sweet potato is amazing too. Great selection of Rise Kombucha and various juices. I would highly recommend to anyone who likes fresh whole foods! Parking is hard to find during busy hours downtown but well worth the time spent looking. They even have local ciders and vino!"}
{"text":"Catering to the 9-5 workers in the business district, this place is like an oasis. Everything on the menu is vegan, and everything on the menu is gluten-free. PLUS: everything on the menu is 100% delicious. The \"oaxaca\" is perhaps the tastiest salad I've ever had, filling me up with brown rice, kale, avocado, beet, tortilla chips, and the yummiest dressing known to humankind, with a little bit of a spicy kick.  The staff are all joyful and pleasant. The people taking orders and processing payment took e a moment to exchange pleasantries, making me feel like a valued customer and not just a quick buck. Even a kitchen worker flashed me her pearly whites when she noticed me watching her make my lunch with assembly-line precision.  This is a take-out establishment, as it's part of a food court, but there is some seating nearby. There is attention to the use of environmental sustainability, with discounts offered to folks who bring their own bowls or cups, and use of compostable take-out ware otherwise.  The food is more expensive than standard food-court fare, but then isn't your body worth it?"}
{"text":"Worst service by the staff. The place is busy and the staff is very rude and looks tired of their job. Food quantity is very less for the price we pay. Will never go again."}
{"text":"My review is based on the Season 01 box.  Did not enjoy this at all, there were so many raw crunchy vegetables to chew through- I got tired halfway and gave up.  The dressings helped a bit but I felt like the energy I was exerting in chewing and processing this rabbit food was not worth the nutrients gained.  Not satisfying"}
{"text":"This place is a small operation with a limited menu but it has some of the most flavourful and unique items in the PATH system. Tall their boxes are tasty with fresh ingredients and great sauces. The line moves a little slow at lunch, but so does any other good place downtown. The food is hands down the best downtown for anyone looking to eat vegetarian."}
{"text":"Each new location they open up brings Kupfert & Kim closer and closer to achieving perfection. This is their newest (probably) and largest (probably) spot yet, and it lives up to the bar they've set for healthy, delicious take-out lunches.  These bowls are like no other. I'm crazy about anything that has their tahini dressing on it, which I think includes their K&K paleo dish, one of my favourites.  You can order with Ritual now, so there's no need to wait in the (usually sizable) line. Such a welcome addition to my work 'hood."}
{"text":"Great big salad for $11. It was super tasty and exactly what I wanted. I don't know how anyone finds anything in The Path, but afyer finding this spot I found another one just a little further. It was really good."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan spot. Has quickly become my go-to vegan spot for breakfast / brunch and even occasional meetings. Friendly staff, excellent food that reminds vegans and non vegans alike how delicious plant based food can be. For what it is, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Being a gluten free pescatarian looking for lunch in a \"food court\" is quite a challenge...BUT no longer!!! Great lunch at Kupfert & Kim!! Thx ladies for recommending the Oaxaca!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible!!! Who would have thought vegan/gluten free could taste so good! Everything is so fresh, no preservatives, and tasty beyond belief. Usually I have a hard time spending $11 on lunch, but there is no way I could re-create this on my own for the price. Season 1 in First Canadian and the black bean burger in Sunlife are two of my favorites, the green smoothie is also delicious. Yummm"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister as I had wanted a healthier option in downtown. I ordered the Cauliflower Tahini - the roasted cauliflower was really yummy however the dressing was a bit bland. My sister ordered the First Canadian Place ( we both enjoyed this more) - the tempeh was marinated really well and the dressing was slightly tangy. All the dressings came on the side - which I particularly loved because I could try my sister's dressing on my salad and vice versa. Overall, I would come back again but not any time soon because the price was a little steep. For the same price, I preferred the vegan food at Hibiscus in Kensington Market more."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food.  Would love if they had mini-boxes!   The full sizes are very filling and don't make for good leftovers."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Smoothies are to die for?  Its pricey though. CAd7.5 for a smoothie is alot. Wish they will reconsider the pricing:("}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Based on a smoothie. But touted to be a crowd pleaser, so I expected it to be one of the better items on the menu.  I used to pass by a Kupfert and Kim every day on my walk to work, but never ended up going in. I was feeling a bit peckish one day while waiting for a late dinner and I happened upon the Kupfert and Kim at Spadina and Richmond, so I took it as a sign that I was supposed to go in.  After perusing the menu, I settled on the green smoothie. Kale, banana, pear, lime, ginger, mint. \"Crowd pleaser,\" according to the menu. What's not to like?  For $6.65, I think a smoothie should be a bit more substantial. This was thin (both in texture and in taste) and the ginger really overpowered the other flavours. It was a pretty paltry shade of green, which spoke to how little kale was probably in there. I really do think the drink would have benefitted from the flavour and bulk of some extra kale.  I wouldn't order a smoothie again, but I would consider trying the food."}
{"text":"Got the Oaxaca - a bit pricy at $11 for a salad, but definitely fresh and yummy. Lovely decor, fast service, neat concept."}
{"text":"The flavours are good and the food is filling, but it's not memorable. There isn't much service, if any, so it's kind of like takeout. I had the K&K Paleo bowl. The price is average."}
{"text":"This is my go to food. It is high quality and very good.   Three impossibles are always accomplished here: 1) I've never seen even a half wilted piece of spring mix. Food is always fresh any time of day. 2)It's incredible a family of celiacs can have this much choice we all love several things here, but meat eaters and gluten eaters love to eat here as well.  3)All locations are usually busy as ____ (you fill that in as you wish), but the service at all of them is always courteous, fast, and helpful.   They are extremely aware of food allergies and are very accommodating.  This is a very well thought out and executed establishment."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you want to make a healthy choice to the usual pizza, pasta, burger type of lunch. When I go I have the waffles with cashew cream or the avocado like, always delicious :)   Only con would be the price, as it gets expensive eating breakfast, lunch from here daily hah!"}
{"text":"This place is great;  they have delicious gluten free food that is pretty healthy.   The only gripe I'd have about this place is that they kind of skimped on the tofu in my salad. I only got 2 pieces of tofu in it. For the price of 10 dollars, there totally should have been more tofu."}
{"text":"I decided to make a stop at Kupfert & Kim this morning as I have been interested in sampling some of their stuff.  I ordered a small americano and the sweet quinoa breakfast, rounding out to around $9.50.  A bit pricey considering you could probably make the sweet quinoa at home for 1/2 the price, but you are paying for the convenience of having it prepared for you and the competitive prices of PATH eateries.  That said, the sweet quinoa is a fairly large serving, I'd guess about 1 1/2 cups of quinoa.  I believe it's served with almond milk, cinnamon and I thought it said bananas but I can't really tell if there are any.  I got all of the toppings: fresh blueberries, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and hemp seeds.  I found it very filling as I barely ate 1/2 of it.  I arrived just before 8am and there wasn't much of a line so I was served pretty quickly, perhaps I was early enough to beat the morning rush.  I don't know that I'd have breakfast here regularly but it's a great, healthy way to start your day if you're in the area and seeking out a healthy alternative to some of the other breakfast options.  I'd like to come back to try one of the lunch bowls which all sound delicious and appear to be a better value."}
{"text":"A solid three until we can try another dish...  We had the Oaxaca which is your typical Mexican rice bowl. Brown rice, guac, black beans, salsa, a few tortilla chips... All fine but nothing stood out. I strongly hope that the kitchen reads this review and tries to make each component more flavourful. It can be done! We snagged a bite from our friend's Cauliflower Tahini bowl and it was good! So we'll be back to try that and a waffle. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"I ordered the burger of the day and a cashew cookie for lunch using Foodora. There was a side salad, a but of fresh salsa, and guac. The guacamole was not chunky whatsoever but it served as a sauce for my burger.   The burger wasn't meaty so if you're an omni, don't expect it to have the texture of real burgers. Based on what I tasted, it may have a black bean base. No clue what kind of burger it is since it was just called \"burger of the day\". It had a bit of cumin so maybe it's Mexican inspired? It was on a bed of brown rice which looked like it had a cream mixed in. Probably cashew cream.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal. It was filling. It was pricey for the amount but since their ingredients are so fresh, it makes sense. Their cashew cookie was nice too.  Similar to other cashew cookies I've tried."}
{"text":"So good! Everything was delicious. Super filling. Friendly staff. Recommend to anyone looking for a healthy lunch/ dinner. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Went with some girlfriends to try this place out. It was ok. I had the miso broth bowl and I wasn't impressed. It was very filling and I couldn't finish it but the flavours were quite muted. My friends looked good though. One had the curry which she liked. I would recommend to go. It's a nice place and a vegetarian meal is always good just don't get the miso broth"}
{"text":"I've had food from here twice and I think it's hit or miss in terms of flavor. Their curry bowl is way too liquidy and bland. Seemed like it was going to soak through the takeaway box. The texture of whatever was in the stew seemed kind of \"off\", like a certain squash seemed to feel like pineapple or just-cooked eggplant. I wasn't feeling it. Then pairing hot food with a spring salad naturally makes it kind of wilty   The almond and lime or oxacao bowl seem more reliable and fresh."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick, healthy. I got the first Canadian place and it was pretty good!  I'm not vegetarian or vegan but am interested in vegan cuisine. Finding this place was pretty eye opening as there were things I haven't tried before. Tofu slices with nuts inside that was formed to look like a nougat, I've never tasted anything that before. I wasn't a fan of the tofu but it wasn't bad and I'd eat it again.  I brought my box to waterfront and ate it there and it felt amazing.  My food was effortlessly beautiful and it tasted good too."}
{"text":"K&K. Vegan, Vegetables, Very GOOD! Meatless Wheatless is not a lie. Kupfert and Kim offers and range of menu items. They've recently added burgers to their menus and also have an exciting breakfast, smoothie, coffee and dessert menu. You can find something you like here at any time of the day.  There are many debates about K&K about it being healthy or not, but as long as you're conservative on the portions and the sauces that they provide you, you are clear.   My favourite is the Oxaca (not pronounced the way it spelled). It's filling and has a lot nice spicy flavour. I've googled searched the nutrition on this box and I've heard reviews that its high in sodium and really not that healthy at all, but to avoid this you can say no to the \"tortilla chips\" and take it easy on the dressing. Everything else in this box is fresh and healthy.   The breakfast menu is also very enticing. I've had the steel cut oats and was very satisfied after doing so. It was a nice portion and they added fresh nuts and fruits to my liking. Coffee is also great here for the mornings, a little more on the expensive side and you're also forced to get almond/soy milk because they are afterall, vegan.   Finally, the dessert menu - my favourite part. My favourite dessert is by far the Earth & city Brownie which is locally brought in from a bakery that specializes in vegan desserts. If you're ever craving for a sweet fix and don't want to go too crazy. Try this.  I would say everythign at kupfert and kim is great. The only thing I would suggest is to go early (11:45am). because the lines get crazy! Service is great here, they try to be as fast as they can.  Also, there is a new location in Brookfield place for those closer located towards union.  A great place for lunch during the week!"}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden in the PATH under the First Canadian Place. It's wheatless and meatless! I ordered the First Canadian Place bowl, and it was absolutely delicious.  There was quinoa, carrots, kale, tempeh, sweet potato and beat slaw dressed in a chia maple dressing. It also came with cabbage, but I opted out.  You get SO much in the box, for such a little price! There was 3 people in line ahead of me, and they were still SO quick to get my food to me! I think I waited for 12 seconds before my meal was ready. Fast, cheap and delicious. Not to mention: HEALTHY!"}
{"text":"green smoothie bowl tasted like water mixed with grass , and the toppings were minimal, around 4 black berries. Threw it out after 3 bites unfortunately.  :("}
{"text":"Came here for the banana cocoa muffin (they also offer a seasonal one which was apple today) which Was still warm from the oven. So moist and delicious and tasted like real bananas unlike generic muffins. Would definitely come back again for it. Just what I was craving ! 3.98 plus tax."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews here, I decided to take the following:  - Oxaca salad - Green Smoothie (NO MINT!)  I was not disappointed. For about $20, I got a filling, delicious meal and a great smoothie that washed it all down.  The salad was really brown rice, beans, a VERY generous helping of guacamole (key to a delicious meal) and lots off bite-sized raw kale around the edges and julienned beets.  SO. DELICIOUS. I scarfed it down like a crazy person, it was so good.  The smoothie was also good, especially without mint (I hate mint anyway), and not at all green-y tasting or disgusting. Kind of sweet because of the bananas.  I can't believe the lineup however, which is why it is getting one star off.   DO NOT COME BETWEEN 12 noon - 1 p.m.!!!  By the time 1 p.m. rolled around, it was a ghost town, and no one was in the line-up. Before 1 p.m.? OMG. At least 20 people in line ahead of me, moving at a snail's pace.  The line-up in INSANE and I know they're working hard and trying, but OMG it takes forever. They should totally do a Ford-style factory line up to create the most popular salads ahead of time (Oxaca, etc), and just keep pumping them out so that the line goes faster.  I do like that they take your name and by the time you get to the register (5 people away), your name is called out and your receipt is already ready to be paid, no waiting to enter anything.  I'd definitely come back. Heck, I'd walk down here just to eat."}
{"text":"Very delicious!! I was very happy to be able to eat something so refreshing and delicious here! Plus if you have dietary restrictions like I do and the person I was dining with it's a wonderful place! Also the decor and atmosphere is really nice and perfect for summer! One flaw was it was difficult to get water but otherwise good!"}
{"text":"By far my favourite vegetarian restaurant that I've tried. I was starving after a workout class on King St. so walked over here. There is limited seating but we were lucky enough to find some. I ordered the cauliflower tahini bowl. It was absolutely delicious. I loved every bit of it. I'm not sure what they put in their hummus to make it taste so good. I also really enjoyed the cracker. I just wish this restaurant was closer to my workplace."}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this place but, unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. Not sure if it was because I got a less delicious bowl, but I easily could have made this salad at home."}
{"text":"very very good. The positive reviews are not without merit.  Had the Oaxaca and was very impressed by the flavor in there. In reality it's just like a healthier version of a taco salad but I truly enjoyed it. I think this is the first time in my life I've had lunch without some sort of meat incorporated. Very tasty and filling stuff. Problem now is I expect to be starving in a couple of hours. I am a carnivore.  Gotta try the coffee next."}
{"text":"I'm not a big vegan eater but,  this place really has great food. I had the black bean bun less burger and kale salad. Grabbed a side of olive oil and drenched the burger and kale, it was perfect. Left feeling really good and not full like a cow."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian it's was pretty great to find K&K when I moved to Toronto. Food is fresh, served quickly, and there are plenty of options in the all-vegetarian menu. On the less great side, quinoa is usually pretty watery and holy crap they sure do lots be to fill with kale. Kale is nice sure, but all things in moderation. Top recommendation is the Oaxaca Bowl. All kinds of things, plus nacho chips."}
{"text":"Never dissapointed! Food was super good n fresh and the staff are always warm n super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I don't ever go out of my way to find vegan and gluten-free options so honestly that label means nothing to me, but I've heard lots of good things about here from gluten-tolerant carnivorous coworkers so I gave it a shot with the SEASON.01 salad. and oh baby, let me say I have never been so. satisfied. with a SALAD before.  here's the low down: - quinoa and chickpeas for protein and substance - kale, broccoli, and matchstick carrot and cucumber for crunch - dehydrated yam chips for crunch 2.0 - the broccoli is steamed! how thoughtful is that? to me, raw broccoli tastes like grass. I'm already eating a salad, I don't need to feel like a cow - pickled beets and dried cranberries for flavor and texture 3.0 - a generous portion of lemon tahini sauce just makes it all meld together and itself is so taste  the amount of variation in texture meant it took me a considerable amount of time to get through this box. although I normally eat at a relatively normal speed even when eating at my desk, I felt like I was literally chewing non-stop for an hour. an hour! that's my complaint - eating for too long. tired jaws. #firstworldproblems.  the select organic items in this mix makes you feel better about the price - but really, considering how healthy it is + how satiated you get afterwards, it really knocks a ton of the other financial district lunch options out of the park. and relatively, is very reasonable. non-salad items do seem a bit pricey, however.  I've only gone back again once (also for Season.01) but it seems like plenty of other options are solid as well. wait times are minimal and they've clearly made an effort to max efficiency: pre-ordering on the iPad, double card terminals for the one cash register, pre-portioned sauces."}
{"text":"My former coworker bet his life on me liking this place, so I was glad I didn't have to kill anyone after lunch that day. Flavor without heavy grease or oils isn't an easy challenge, so diving into one of their lunch bowls, I was amazed by the different colors and layers of flavor this little box offered.  I opted to get the Season 01 which is their newest lunch addition. My coworkers opted for the Oxaca, which has a mexican-like theme to its ingredients. I was drawn to the Season simply because I love Tabouli. The box included carrots, pickled beets (mmm), fresh kale, cranberries, broccoli, tabouli and these super crispy yuca chips on a bed of quinoa. Drizzled after with their lemon tahini sauce and I scarfed down that bad boy in no time.  I admit I came back for a second time and got the same thing just cause it was that good. I've already recommended it to a number of my downtown friends who share my interest for good food. It is a little pricery for a lunch ($12 I think) but mm for a meal that leaves me satisfied, feeling good and not bloated I'm a-okay paying a little extra."}
{"text":"As a pro-organic, pro-health eater, I love this addition to the neighbourhood.  The food is tasty and they provide a lovely house made hot sauce -- which is actually quite hot and tasty, hurray!  Although they seem a bit black seed happy, sprinkling it over many dishes but not disclosing it on the menu, and has long lines and insufficient seating between 12-1 pm on week days, I'd recommend it.  Note -- it's open until 10 pm every day of the week and isn't really crowded other than the lunch rush. For me, I've stopped going to the non-organic, super cramped, and loud Fresh across the street and head here instead."}
{"text":"On the fence. This place is amazing for having a great variety of vegan munches. The Oaxaca is a favourite by a landslide. The treats are also awesome, esp the Hello Dolly Bar. They also serve Sam James Cut Coffee with a variety of vegan milks which is off the chain.  BUT. The food is crazy over priced and will sting the wallet. Also lots of lack lustre items. The Curry Bowl has the texture of frozen and tastes unbalanced and just full of dry spices. Some of the treats are yucky or just edible.   Certainly a nice change from a lot of PATH options, but prices are certainly contributing to the end of the hype in favour of places like Freshii and IQ.  I say all this and still pop in at least once a week for a Oaxaca bowl and a 9 dollar smoothie."}
{"text":"I like the food here but it is way too loud for a brunch spot. Conversations are nice, shouting matches not so much."}
{"text":"This place is okay in terms of the healthfulness and flavour of their dishes. However, I feel that you could probably get the equivalent or better for a comparable or cheaper price in Koreatown - since many of the dishes are Asian inspired or \"fusion.\"   If you're in the neighbourhood not a bad option but not a destination restaurant either."}
{"text":"Fairly small interior, but that's to be expected when it's in the prime core of the city!  Lots of healthy vegetarian options. They aren't kidding when they say meatless & wheatless. A great, healthy alternative!  I'd love to try one of the dessert bowls."}
{"text":"Ordered the K&K Paleo and was blown away. It was absolutely delicious, filled to the brim with a bevy of fresh ingredients, tahini dressing and these awesome little hemp heart falafels. The staff are friendly and the prices completely below what you pay in the area. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Aren't all these locations pretty much the same?  The food is consistent from one location to the next.    I like the salad bowls.  Freshly prepared with a variety of ingredients.  The dressing is always the perfect amount for the portion.  I'm going to get the hot sauce with everything from now on.  I really wish I knew about it before.    Oh yeah, I like getting a kombucha because I can taste the sweetness and the fizz without the guilt of drinking soda pop."}
{"text":"Great salad plave - especially for gluten free and/ or vegan. I found them on ritual and it's always super quick. The first Canadian place bowl is good salad (not too heavy if dressing on the side) and the green smoothies are delicious"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and we had a really good experience. The line moved really quickly and the dishes we both ordered were phenomenal. I'm both lactose and gluten intolerant so it was really easy to order here. The portions are also a really good size.   I ordered the Oaxaka bowel and my friend ordered the Cauliflower Tahini bowel. We both give both of the bowls two thumbs up.   If you are wondering where to eat in the area take your bowls up to the food court, which is up one level. It was really clean and easy to get a table :)"}
{"text":"Some years ago I was craving my childhood treat - a peanut buster parfait at DQ. I recall standing in line, looking around and noticing the sheer girth, sickly pallor, and general unhappiness of the people linked up to eat that food, and I fled. Kupfort & Kim is like that, but reversed. The people I see in here are the people aspire to someday be: lean, fit, healthy, sexy and having a lot of fun. Not to ignore or minimize the greater social/economic forces at work in this comparison, but if you are willing to invest in your future and present self, K&K makes it simple to make great food choices. Their offerings are not only free of wheat, meat and bad karma, but these dishes are high quality, tasty, fresh, and creative. They even offer great treats - the cookies are delish, and actually good for you, and they serve the best Kombucha around. I didn't think I could be happier here and then I learned you can also get 10% off with your Yoga Tree tag. If only I could pronounce - or remember - the name of this place, we'd be batting 1,000. But I suspect I'll be here often enough to sort that out."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and got the Oaxaca, it was amazing... it's like guacamole with chips but you also have brown rice and other warm veggies all in a bowl! The portion is decent for the food quality and the price, will definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"This is a great vegan place, and one of the only restaurants I can take my best friend to brunch to. Their waffle is excellent. The flavors are mostly paired well and unique. Notably, their baked goods are really moist and soft, which I find is really hard to find in gluten-free vegan goods! I have never ordered anything here that I didn't finish. The atmosphere is casual and their Spadina location could do with a bit of decor update because the food is better than the restaurant. Also the washroom is frankly disgusting so don't pee there. Open concept kitchen which is always nice."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. The First Canadian Place is my favourite menu item. The sweet potato is warm and nourishing. You leave feeling energized from the food - what healthy food should do. The good news is that it is healthy AND tasty."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast at this location. Although a bit too pricey for my liking, the granola bowl and oat bowl are both very hearty and tasty. It will definitely leave you full beyond lunch hour. The staff seem very into what they are selling, which is nice to see compared to the other local eateries along the PATH."}
{"text":"My curry bowl had broth left over when the curry was suppose to be \"puree\". I expected a higher quality of food"}
{"text":"This ain't no vegan nonsense.   I love the filling and eye-pleasing Cauliflower Tahini bowl: organic quinoa, house-made hummus, roasted cauliflower, za'atar salsa, carrots, cabbage, beets, mint, pomegranate, organic arugula, radish, sesame seeds, seed flatbread with lemon tahini sauce.   The meal is reasonably priced (11.73), especially given that cauliflowers are so expensive at the moment. All ingredients are sustainable, organic and local where possible  This is basic, but not boring fruit and veg and you won't leave hungry! I'm sure that they will continue to thrive because the owners know what their customers are looking for in a plant-based experience.   They are doing well in the drinks department as well. Kombucha on tap, smoothies, cold pressed juices, yerba mate, coldbrew etc...apparently cocktails, beer, cider and biodynamic wines are on the way.  Come and taste the rainbow at K&K."}
{"text":"I will support anyone who courageously leaves their desk job to pursue their true passion in life.  At Kupfert & Kim, the long line-ups indicate that this decision may not have been a bad idea after all considering all the new locations popping up in Toronto's downtown core.   It is nice to see some healthy alternatives in the PATH. Think hemp seeds, kale, quinoa....how can one go wrong? I am a huge fan of the green smoothie as I'm currently obsessed with kale. With that said, this smoothie just elevates this ingredient to a whole other level by combining it with banana, pear and hemp seeds. Delicious. The Oaxacca salad is also a favorite with a lot of customers, and at times they even sell out. Personally, I prefer the Paleo or Dan's salad. The coffee is always great, as are the energy balls and cookies.   This brings me to why I only give K&K only 4 stars. The line-up at First Canadian is ridiculous though it's recently gotten better. The Sun Life location seems to be quicker and more efficient plus they have a greater selection of baked goods and also the K& K waffles. My only other complaint has to do with the prices--I know this is the PATH but I suppose it's the only thing that deters me from coming here every day."}
{"text":"Love Kupfert & Kim for their quick, always fresh, healthy bowls. The menu is interesting and full of organic foods and wheat alternatives, which is amazing for those of us who have sensitivities but still want to enjoy a lunch that's flavourful. It's pricy.. what can I say? That's not for everyone .. but the ingredients are high quality and portion sizes are perfect."}
{"text":"My favourite vegan place in Toronto. I wish they have more locations uptown Toronto besides central dtown. I would so choose it over Freshii or Fresh.  First Canadian Place is one of my favourite - it's a really filling bowl. I love their roasted yam and maple chia sauce. I've tried their chips with guacamole, which makes a great snack. The guacamole taste really fresh and their chips are really crunchy.  If you're craving something sweet but don't want to feel guilty then their waffle is a great option. I love the addition of hemp seeds and their vanilla coconut ice cream is delicious.  Their smoothies are really good too. I usually get blueberry or PB mocha.   Their baked goods are not really my favourite thing to get there though...I tend to see the paper bag soaked with grease vs. other bakeries."}
{"text":"This is a vegan and gluten free place.  It is a small joint located in the underground mall that extends through much of downtown Toronto.  I ate here several times.  There is no seating area, so you buy your stuff and find one of the food courts in a different area.  The food is very fresh, but somewhat bland.  There is a huge line during lunch hours but it moves fairly quickly.  They were happy to customize my order--they tend to use a lot of pickled veggies and I had to get them to leave those off."}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time since I'm getting more and more into vegetarian/vegan food.   Food - ordered the popular cauliflower and tahini bowl. I was surprised by the portion size and the flavours were fresh and the ingredients complemented one another. The cauliflower itself was pretty tasty - never thought a not fried cauliflower could taste that good.   My boyfriend ordered the burger of the day. He said it was alright and the portion size was less compared to the bowl.   Service - fairly quick. They bring it to your table. It's the usual that you get to experience in these restaurants.   Next time, I want to try out their waffles. Looked delicious."}
{"text":"I never thought healthy, gluten-free, meat-free food can taste so good. Both my curry bowl and soup tasted amazing and fresh. The bowl had barley instead of rice, which was a great substitute. The servers were really friendly too. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite healthy spots in the Path.   I love their Asian inspired box - the almond lime one.   The prices are relatively reasonable for the path (around $10) and they usually have enough supply for dinner around 6:30pm as well.   Even the hot sauce is vegan and green (it kind of looks like a green smoothie."}
{"text":"This place could be soooooooo great. It's such a great concept. Unfortunately the service is always just plain rude. I've been here a dozen times and never once has anyone ever said thank you. Today, they were obviously having some plumbing problems with water overflowing from the bathroom into the seating area. Not pleasant and still no thank you. The baked goods are outstanding, but I'm honestly not sure if it's worth wading through the attitude to buy them. Definitely some room for improvement here."}
{"text":"I loved their superfood salad! Very filling, and the basil dressing was awesome. The prices are more affordable compared to Fresh and Urban Herbivore. Food is served quickly, and staff are friendly! They also have a selection of juices, kombucha, vegan coffee and baked goods! I love that you have the option to dine in their beautiful seating area (a similar concept to Live Organic Food Bar) without being served. I'm so glad I came, and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Great experience - a new brunch favorite for sure! The gluten free waffle with fresh blueberries and whipped cashew topping was delicious and filling while feeling light. My friend had a roasted cauliflower and home made hummus dish that also fared well. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tried their oatmeal cookie which was pretty filling for a small cookie. Didn't even feel guilty eating it because it was made up of all the healthy nuts you can think of!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your everyday go-to food, Kupfert & Kim is great.   Perfect place to take your extremely picky, gluten-free, or vegan friends to while still being able to order a wide variety of items.  Highly recommend trying their smoothies :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch at around 11:30. They were not too busy, but still had quite a bit of people inside. Their design is very comfortable with lots of natural sunlight coming in. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, their service was amazing as they would bring and refill your water. They offer breakfast until 11am, and both lunch and dinner options.   I ordered the Cauliflower Tahini ($12.50) as per the counter staff's recommendation. It is served with quinoa as the base and packed with hummus, roasted cauliflower, za'atar salsa and mixture of vegetables. A lemon-tahini sauce is served on the side, along with sprigs of fresh mint, pomegranate seeds and a crispy flatbread. This bowl is packed with flavour! The mixture of textures and flavours of each ingredient really complemented each other very well. The roasted cauliflower was the best part of the dish in my opinion - I guess that's why this is one of their top dishes! With all the nutrition packed in just one bowl, it gave me tons of energy to last me through the day.   Overall, I'd definitely return to try their other dishes. The environment here is very welcoming and a great place to grab lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad to-go at the Spadina location and when I arrived home most of the ingredients were missing and the carton was nearly empty. Called the store and there was no answer, so I decided to use the e-mail on their website to inform them of how upset I was. I never received a response, so I will not be returning because through my eyes customer service and quality control are very important. There are many other vegan, and gluten free options in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best place for fresh vegetarian options. I could eat here every day if it were possible.   Tons of delicious bowls all with incredible protein options and that fit multiple diets and requirements.   I also recommend trying the water or tea they make in house. Every time I'm totally in love with it!   I've never had their desserts but I was with some friends who had them and wanted to orders even more on the way out.   I can't recommend this place enough if you're a vegetarian or just someone looking for a healthy meal filled with greens."}
{"text":"For anyone looking for this restaurant, IT'S DOWNSTAIRS IN THE MALL!  Ate here for the first time today and had the First Canadian Place, I was pleasantly surprised! It tasted fresh and yummy and there was actually a LOT of food packed in there. I finished most of it (not all of it) and actually felt too full. I'm excited to come back to try a different salad. The cashier girl wasn't the friendliest but at a place like this it's all about the food right?"}
{"text":"Great gluten free and vegan options.  This is my favourite vegan fast food joints in the city.   The sweets are a must try. The coffee is descent but not something I would go out oft way for.   The PB mocha shake is the best drink in the city !    The big Kim is the best vegan burger in the city. I even like it more than a meat based burger."}
{"text":"Picked up a lunch bowl Oaxaca, that I meant to try for a long time.   Really like the idea of Meatless and not so Wheatless. Like the idea that this place caters for people who prefer a plant based diet. And is also Organic for the most part I think.   The bowl comes with brown rice, beans, kale, corn, white radish (daikon), some corn chips, salsa, guac and cashew cream.   The rice was warm, the beans and corn and everything when mixed had really good flavour and seasoned to perfection. I think the dressing salsa, cashew cream need to be ordered on the side instead of drizzled on top. Would definitely go again and try other bowls.   Took some hot sauce in the side and boy was it good. Jalapeño, lime, cilantro/parsley and perhaps a lot of salt.   Would go back just for that!! Will try the Desserts soon."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled but I found this place a complete rip off. Sure I get most of their food is organic, but the price of a meal is almost double what Salad Days (in Yorkville) costs for about 2/3 of the portion.    I had the \"burger\", which is a basically a black bean patty with quinoa and a fairly fresh salad.  The presentation in the cardboard box was nice but the actual patty itself was disappointing.  It was too mushy and I've had black bean burgers from different places and they were much better than K&K.   Honestly though, I could probably live with that if the portion wasn't so small and expensive. It costs about $13 tax in and I'm still hungry.    I seriously don't get why all these healthy places like Freshii, this place, etc. charge so much when it's really just veggies.  Salad Days has it right. Charge just enough to make a profit so you have less spoilage and please your customers.  Anyways, as for this place...not a fan. Sorry."}
{"text":"I did a ritual order at lunchtime. Pick up was fast and easy. The food is quite tasty, mostly quinoa and other healthy foods. Not as boring as the usual lettuce and greens salads. It's a good choice of healthy choice in the food court, although a little pricey."}
{"text":"5 stars for the cappucino, 4 for the food. Ordered the Oaxaca box for lunch which was delicious but needed more kale. It was fresh and delicious though. There was a bit of confusion with hot sauce as the lady asked if we wanted some, we said yes, and then she put something in the box that wasn't the hot sauce... It ended up being on a shelf that you got yourself. That being said, I would have happily walked away with the whole container, it was incredible sauce. Note: they don't have their full menu here (disappointing) and only feature one burger a day."}
{"text":"This location is a bit messy. I was waiting in line watching them make some salad bowls and their ingredients didn't look fresh to me. This was at like 6pm on a weekday... so maybe it was an off day? I opted for the smoothie bowl instead, which was tasty. Somehow he rang me in for a smoothie bowl but gave me a smoothie instead, so I had to get that fixed."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something healthy but still heart, so I dropped by this place and I wasn't disappointed. I got the poke poke while my friend got the burger of the day and both of them were delicious. Each of the dishes come with a healthy serving of rice which makes it very filling.   The restaurant only has a few spot lights, so it does get quite dark after sunset. So, if you like being able to see your food, try finding a seat closer to the lights.   Food came out quite quick, I remember waiting around 10 minutes after ordering, which is nice if you're looking for something quick and delicious.   They've also got a selection of juices and drinks like cold brew coffee, but they were quite pricey so I decided to forego them since I'd rather spend my money on food.   If you like Fresh (which is right across the street) or just want a quick and healthy meal, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food: The selection of salad is amazing. I have to say that they give really decently large portion sizes for each order. My fave salad to order would have to be the Oaxaca (Pronounced like Wa-Ha-Ka). It combines the crunch factor of tortilla chips and my fav guacamole spread in there as well as your usual greens and mixture of healthy ingredients.  My other fav would have to be the Cauliflower tahnini salad--- I LOVE LOVE LOVE the dressing. It has so much garlic flavours in there and I personally like the fact that all the dressings are served on the side. I like the fact that I can add my own amount without the salad being overly drenched. I love that each salad has their own specialty salad dressing to go along with the ingredients. This is not your traditional toppings to allow for a variety of textures to play in your mouth. Each salad is designed uniquely and paired with a completely different taste of salad dressing.   For breakfast, I love treating myself to the delicious waffle with the cashew dressing/sauce. It taste delicious!!! Some fruits are served and topped on the waffle and I can be full until later afternoon with this filling breakfast meal.  I've also had their house-made granola with maple poured in it. It taste good but the first few times I ordered, I felt that it tasted too dry for me and afterwards, I always remember to have them drench the granola so it tastes less dry!  Location: This is located in the beautiful lower concourse level (near the food court) of the brookfield place building. It doesn't have a line that often and all the staff are very nice.   Price: Each salad is too costly after tax. I can never finish my salad in one sitting anyways and often have at least half the bowl leftover. For a small eater like myself, I wish that there would be an option to order \"SMALL\" and then I would not waste the salad like that and actually feel like I'm not wasting $15 on a salad lunch.   I had to take off a star only because I can't treat myself to this salad lunch all the time due to how costly the salad would be. BUT I LOVE THE FOOD!  Keep On making good stuff for us !"}
{"text":"I just finished reviewing the same K&K restaurant from the Brookfield place location, but because I eat from both locations -- I should also share my opinion here but for this location.   Food: I've only ordered salad from this location and never tried their breakfast. The selection of salad is amazing. I have to say that they give really decently large portion sizes for each order. My fave salad to order would have to be the Oaxaca (Pronounced like Wa-Ha-Ka). It combines the crunch factor of tortilla chips and my fav guacamole spread in there as well as your usual greens and mixture of healthy ingredients. My other fav would have to be the Cauliflower tahnini salad--- I LOVE LOVE LOVE the dressing. It has so much garlic flavours in there and I personally like the fact that all the dressings are served on the side. I like the fact that I can add my own amount without the salad being overly drenched. I love that each salad has their own specialty salad dressing to go along with the ingredients. This is not your traditional toppings to allow for a variety of textures to play in your mouth. Each salad is designed uniquely and paired with a completely different taste of salad dressing. I also like to top off my salad with your selection of HOT SAUCE \"GREEN COLOURED\" from the side table! I use it to top any salad and it gives it an extra spicy kick!  Location: This is located at the First Canadian place (first storefront you can see and drawn to since it is right a the corner and the first choice of food if you're heading towards Longo's) -- typically a busy place with a line (people working and looking for food in this building are always in a rush).   Price: Each salad is too costly after tax. I can never finish my salad in one sitting anyways and often have at least half the bowl leftover. For a small eater like myself, I wish that there would be an option to order \"SMALL\" and then I would not waste the salad like that and actually feel like I'm not wasting $15 on a salad lunch.  I had to take off a star only because I can't treat myself to this salad lunch all the time due to how costly the salad would be. BUT I LOVE THE FOOD!"}
{"text":"Small portions for price. However, loaded with nutrition and natural flavor. Feel good walking out. Cho cookie was nice at the beginning of salad bowl. Some Canada word in title. It was good. A bit low on tempeh, not too much yam (that's good). Loaded with all sorts of taste - very healthy Nice gal behind counter that was on it. Fast service. Don't let the line fool you. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place is a pure Vegan place for sure. I didn't know that until I walked in and looked at the menu. My sister picked this place for our lunch date. I have to say their food is very fresh, but it is all veggies. This is not really what I am use to. I would say this is a great place for a healthy lunch, but the prices is a bit pricey. The coffee here is good - good quality beans and aroma from the coffee, ah ... wonderful smell. The only thing that I didn't like was there was no cream available for my coffee. They only had almond milk and coconut milk, which in my opinion, doesn't give the same smoothness that cream gives to the coffee. Overall, my experience was good."}
{"text":"I decided to give Kupfert & Kim another try the other day and I was actually pleased with the service and food. I went during the non rush hours of the day so the line up was not as discouraging as it has been in the past. The service was also pretty good - I did not wait too long for my order to be made and the staff was pretty friendly.  This time around I was feeling \"snacky\" so I got a PB & Cacao Smoothie and a Nut Bar. The PB & Cacao Smoothie cost around $5-$6 and consisted of peanut butter, banana, cacao, lucuma, and sea salt. The texture wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be and the size was fairly small. The taste was pretty good - not too much peanut butter though but a good balance of everything over all. Not too sweet but I guess I would have preferred a thicker texture. The Nut Bar was very rich, sticky and sweet... but I have a sweet tooth so I really enjoyed it. At $3.50 I think this nut bar is a good \"healthier\" alternative for a sweet snack versus a chocolate brownie at some chain restaurant!  Overall, I was quite satisfied with my visit. The snacks were pretty good and I would probably come back again to try their energy balls, cookies... and maybe even try another box... one day."}
{"text":"You had me at Vegan congee. Delicious and healthy plant-based foods that won't make you feel guilty- unless of course you are like me and order all of their sweets off the menu. But who can resist their beautiful waffles and dessert menu?   Highly recommend you try the Kim's Congee if you enjoy Korean cuisine. The congee is made with soft brown rice with all the fixings and topped with their homemade kimchi. It is simply delicious.  We also got their smoothie, muffin, and dessert cup to go and they were all great.   Of course we had to return the next day to try their famous waffles! It was no mistake to return for these. I opt'd for a side of ice cream but don't go for a fruity one like I did. I believe ordering a plain vanilla or chocolate would have paired better with this waffle. (I think I just wanted to try the exotic flavor!) We also ordered a hot drink to pair with this lovely breakfast item. The waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. The fruits were a nice garish.  Great place to grab to-go treats as well as dine in."}
{"text":"Have been a big fan of K&K for a long time now and frequent patron but on my recent visit to the Spadina location I had a unpleasant experience. They completely messed up my order and when I called to see how they could rectify it they were totally rude about it. In my opinion, if you made a mistake as a business you should do everything you can to fix it at any (reasonable) cost. I know it's a healthy fast food place but it should still offer great customer service. Will definitely not be coming back to this location or refer any more coworkers to this place. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch (Brookfield place food court downstairs). Nice looking take out place, I got the K&K's waffle ($7.50+ tax).  The waffle was seriously disappointing because the texture is very hard and chewy. Even though it says \"house made\", it seemed to be made before hand and reheated or was just sitting there for too long. It wasn't light nor fluffy. It was a struggle to cut through it with my knife.  Topped with blueberries, hemp seeds and maple syrup. However, I was also disappointed in the coconut-cashew cream-- it was lumpy, unevenly spread out on my waffles and it lacked cashew flavour.  On the plus side, my friend's Burger of the day was delicious-- nice blend of creamy, crunchy and tangy from the avocado, tomatoes, yam, rice and salad."}
{"text":"Great healthy options but hella expensive... $8.50 for a small cup of smoothie. I got the vanilla cacao which doesn't taste like anything special. It has banana, vanilla, walnuts, maple syrup, hemp seeds, cacao, sunflower seeds and coconut milk but they had no more coconut milk so they swapped it for almond milk. I'm happy it's not sweet, but you don't taste much, except for the almond milk; it's kind of icy tasting to be honest.  For this price, I'm better off buying the ingredients in bulk and making a whole jug at home."}
{"text":"I pick up lunch from this place 3 times a week for the past 6 months.  The quality is OK, however, lately the quantity of the food has been FAR from being consistent.   Sometimes the box is 1/4 empty,  Sometimes they don't add enough dressing, Sometimes they forget to add an item.  For example they used to include 5 pieces of Tempeh in \"first canadian place\" but nowadays there's only 3 and they're super dry.  It is disappointing to see the management doesn't care about these issues.  There's no place to provide feedback on their website!"}
{"text":"I ordered a vegan burger and it taste so good, definitely going back for pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"Move over fresh! This place is taken over! Friends whenever you want to do a lunch date! I'm there!"}
{"text":"With all the terrible food court options around Kupfert & Kim is the best around - and surprisingly not even the most expensive.   I've had just about everything there - the breakfast oats, quinoa... Yummy green smoothies, Portland's own Stumptown coffee (amazing) with great non dairy subs. While pricey their energy balls and brownies all taste amazing!  As for lunch - again very good. Tried a few - favourites being the season.01 and Oaxaca. There's a line every day from 1145-2 pm but goes quickly and service is super friendly. Definitely worth the wait and super happy to have a place like this in the PATH - I'm sure it's only a matter of time before we see a second one open (here's hoping!)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Wish there was one in Los Angeles. Really wild scene for me seeing dozens of office workers in the que for Vegan Food, something you wouldn't see in LA. Really sophisticated menu, excellent salads, super fresh and fast friendly service even when the line is long. My fave is the One Canadian.  Nice affordable downtown vegan food with a big city flair."}
{"text":"meatless, Wheatley, AND chocolate-y. Yum! Smoothie bowl so refreshing. Quick and comfortable."}
{"text":"I occasionally eat vegetarian and vegan meals and decided to give this place a try.  The place looks really hip and is filled with rather hispter looking people staring at their Apple devices and looking deep. I felt a little out of place there to be honest.  I decided to get one of the their salads. It was colorful and looked delicious. I found it quite expensive for the size and in addition to the tip jar, the debit machine also asked me how mcuh I wanted to tip. I found this quite obnoxious as I was picking my own dish and going home to eat. What's next - Subway and McDonalds asking tips from their customer? According to Kupfert & Kim it is apparently \"the way of the jedis\". Cute. Not.  In any case the salad looked visually delicious with lots of funky looking items in it. As I ate it, I realized the taste itself was much blander than expected. Once I was finished, I felt unsatisfied and too full & bloated at the same time which is an odd combination.  I had much higher expectations but unfortunately I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the exact same thing (First Canadian Place) as what I got a few days ago at the Bay Street K&K (in the PATH food court), also as takeout, but the portion given at this location was 30-40% smaller. Very disappointed to say the least, considering the prices are the exact same. The salad dressings at K&K in general are pretty bland imo, so I would get all the sauces on the side and use maybe just half."}
{"text":"Tucked away apart from the main food court (you have to turn a corner), but clean, bright, and reliable as always :) They close surprisingly late, 7:30 pm on weekdays and 3 pm on Fridays although the front grab-go section stays open much later. There is only takeout here since there are no seats except at the food court.   Huge portion sizes for the mains and very filling! My brother ordered the almond lime bowl (brown rice, organic tofu, daikon, cashews, etc) and was to full for dessert lol. \"I didn't know vegan food could be so filling,\" he said to me afterwards :p  I strongly recommend the First Canadian Place bowl, especially if you prefer quinoa (complete protein!) over rice. The tempeh I wasn't a huge fan off because of the acidic taste, but pretty sure that's how it is everywhere. Brother also ordered the vanilla shake, which he said tasted like chocolate. This, he said, was also very filling.  Beware many items tend to sell out in the late afternoon/evening, such as the burger. Come for lunch!"}
{"text":"Lots of variety and delicious salads! The desserts are also really good. I like it better than the IQ Foods in the cafeteria on the top floor because of its variety and because the prices are slightly more reasonable."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty. Colorful food. Any item on the menu is good. My favorites are: Oaxaca and the Seaweed & Miso Broth bowls. Their guacamole? is very good. Another notable item is the K&K Waffle (we usually get this for weekend brunch).  Prices are reasonable. Quality of the food is A+ and A for effort and taste."}
{"text":"Had the almond lime and didn't like it. My boyfriend got the oaxaca and I wound up eating some of his, it was alright. If we lived nearby we'd probably come here again, but since it's out of the way we only went the one time. Wouldn't recommend going out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  I stopped in for lunch during a long flight layover and was so impressed. The restaurant interior is refreshing, the service is superb (they bring you a glass of water with every order without being asked, who does that?!), and the food impeccable.  I had the Cauliflower Tahini ($12.50) salad and a Chocolate Chewy nut bar (GF, made by a local company called Sweets from the Earth) and both were incredible!   All their take-out containers/cutlery are biodegradeable and you do get a discount if you bring your own containers. You order at the counter, and they serve you at your table.  Now if only they would open in my hometown, I'd be there daily!"}
{"text":"1 star for the first time I came here: Ordered KIM'S CONGEE, it was burned and mushy at the same time. I was hungry that day, wish it'd just have been bland.  4 stars for the second time: Ordered the HARVEY'S SUPERSALAD, all ingredients fresh and delicious! Big portion size too.  Guess I'll stick to the salads here. Very busy during lunch time, so food to go is best."}
{"text":"I need to start my review by stating I'm not a vegan nor am I gluten free.   If I don't care to have a healthy meal, I'll be at burgers priest in a heartbeat. Or getting a bacon combo 12 inch sub at belly busters. Dinner last Friday was a porterhouse for 2 at barberian's. And I'm pretty sure celiac isn't a real thing. I eat bread by the loaf. With butter and cheese. And meat.   So me posting a 5 star review for a vegan, gluten free restaurant is a surprise to myself.   But this place is amazing. I've been here like 15x now. Had almost everything on the menu. It tastes amazing, all of it. It's filling, it's interesting and I'm not getting bored of it. This place completely changed my perspective on vegan, healthy eating. Because most vegan restaurants suck, and if they don't, they aren't healthy. Like quinoa fried onion rings isn't a good life choice. It's just a tasty snack food that should be next to steak.   Kupfert and Kim is a 10/10. I enjoy it and I feel great after eating here every time. A total gem. I still will never be vegan though. That's crazy."}
{"text":"Stopped in solo while working downtown for a quick supper and really enjoyed my meal.  Service was friendly but a bit on the slower side. To be honest I think they forgot my order for a while but I wasn't in a rush so it didn't bother me too much!  I opted for their daily water (get it, its good for you!!) with the almond lime bowl (consisting of brown rice, organic tofu, organic bok choy, roasted mushroom, pickled carrots and daikon, carraway slaw, crushed cashews, cilantro, basil, sesame seeds, scallions, lime wedge, optional hot pepper with almond kaffir lime sauce) for dinner.   Food was fresh, well seasoned and very tasty. Enjoyed all of the flavours together plus the home made (?) hot sauce on the tables.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place! I tried the Oaxaca, which was SO good!! I was only in Toronto briefly and wish I could have had it again.  Also came for breakfast one time and couldn't decide what to get so the woman suggested I get half warm quinoa and half granola, did that, which came with nuts, think some dried fruit and cinnamon and almond milk.  It was very good and quite filling! Both times I had the Pb&J energy ball which was SO good! & good for you too.  Only weird/annoying thing was..I got there at 10:45am the first time, the woman told me it was too late for breakfast (ended 10:30) and too early for lunch (starts at 11:00) so bizarre.  So I just waited the 15 minutes to get lunch, which she had ready for me by 11:01, but it was just odd.  The food was so good though, despite that, so giving it 5 stars, highly recommend it and definitely will come back if I'm in Toronto again."}
{"text":"I stop at Kupfert and Kim at least once a week.  Their green smoothie, granola and Oaxaca salads are great.  The items on the menu are solid, but overall the menu is pretty limited, and I wish they added a few special salads based on the seasonal produce.  Also, I wish the nutrition information was readily available for each of their items.  The vegan desserts are surprisingly very tasty, and I don't feel too guilty about eating them.  Prices may seem a bit high for lunch, but I think they're reasonable based on the quality of the ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday. They were quite full but we actually didn't need to wait too long for a seat (You just need to just stand around hawk eyeing all the tables until you see one open up).  Once you've claimed your table, head to the counter to place your order (very friendly service) then grab a table sign (various images of ingredients such as beans) and place it on your table so that they can bring your order to you.  I had the Oaxaca (pronounced \"wah-ha-ka\", you're welcome) bowl which was delicious! It was very flavourful and quite filling (since it is mostly rice and beans), plus I also added tempeh (extra $2 - very tasty). The guac and cashew cream made everything taste wonderfully creamy. Be sure to add their green hot sauce - so good!  I also tried some of the Cauliflower Tahini bowl but I wasn't impressed at all. It looked amazing and beautiful with all the colourful veggies but it was actually quite bland even with all of the tahini sauce mixed in.  Also tried their Almond Cocao smoothie bowl which was delicious! It was like having dessert for a meal - yes please!  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I feel so lucky to work in a building with so many amazing Vegan and Vegetarian options. Needless to say Kupfert & Kim is one of my favorites, I always go for the Oaxaca and there is this seed burger that is on the special board every so often. They are quick considering how insane the line up is at lunch. Also, they have been known to give me an extra P B & J energy ball when I go down late! The coffee is not for me, I found it far too \"earthy\" tasting, but everything else is amazing. Also, try the Hello Dolly Bars, to die for. Yes 11.00 may seem a lot for \"fast food\" but you're paying for a balanced healthy meal, so it is worth it."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try some food from this little shop. I have so much respect for places like this with being gluten free, vegan and sustainable/economically friendly. I do enjoy knowing my food is organic and beneficial to my health. I am allergic to peanuts, I do not have to eat gluten free and I do eat chicken, fish, and animal by-products (not vegan).  I ordered the house granola, it was unbelieveable. So tasty, flavourful, chewy, creamy, nutty and just plain delicious. Unfortunaltely at $6.50 a good size (recycleable/ biodegradeable) container, I cannot afford to go every week. My bowl alone could pay for a big bag of pumpkin seeds. They have significantly marked up their product, and they can because they are the only ones out there with healthy fast food. I don't mind though because I know im encouraging other businesses to do the same thing!   My recommendation is try it! Especially if you have extra dough!"}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times and have tried the First Canadian and Kim boxes. Both were really tasty and surprisingly filling for a meatless lunch. Out of the 2, the Kim is thus far my favorite - the almond chili kefir lime sauce is just so good!  In days I feel I need some greens ingested in my system, this will definitely be my go-to place. A standout out of other greasy lunch options in the PATH."}
{"text":"My friend got the Oaxaca and I got the Cauliflower Tahini. They were both really good! Every ingredient had a different texture and cut to it so it was everything but boring. I couldn't really tell that it was vegan which was definitely a first for me. I would definitely come back and try the curry bowl and the roasted yam next time (mmm). The restaurant was cute and simple but I'm only giving it 4 stars because the confusing ordering process (no wall menu but a menu book for you to look through but.. yeah.. the process didn't click to me) and the noise from the kitchen with everything dropping and banging was slightly alarming / distracting. But the food is ON POINT, best vegan food I've ever had + suuuuper filling.  p.s. They also carry Rise Kombucha! Every store runs out of the mint & chlorophyll ones but they had so many of them in stock which made my day :)"}
{"text":"Let's pretend this is a 3.5 star rating, okay?  Okay:  I've been here twice in the last couple weeks, once for Oaxaca and once for First Canadian. In both visits, the service quality and speed were commendable (considering it was the height of the lunch rush) and the food is certainly good.    But...... I can't quite put my finger on it..... it was \"good\" but not really any better.  They've got quality ingredients and a heartful of good intentions, but both dishes would benefit from a couple of changes to the recipe.  The First Canadian is advertised as having tempeh, but it's just two pieces.  It was a letdown, since they were tasty and deserved to be the centerpiece of the dish.  And the combination of beets and tortilla chips in the Oaxaca is a bit weird.  But I'm nitpicking, aren't I: this is probably the best take-away food in First Canadian Place that doesn't involve standing in line for 20 minutes at Longo's."}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for over 12 years and eat a lot of raw / vegan / gluten free stuff (on account of my vegetarianism and my wife's dairy and wheat intolerance) so I should be in Kupfert & Kim's target demographic. But the first (and probably only) time I tried it, I wasn't feeling it at all. I paid like eleven bucks for this altogether inadequate box of rice, beans and miniscule amounts of vegetables (I had the 'Kim'). It advertised tofu as being part of the meal but I don't think that the one, puny cube counts. I know that organic food can be quite pricey so I'm almost willing to forgive the fact the tiny portion but the fact that the thing was also quite bereft of flavor is far more egregious.   I feel sort of bad and it's the type of place I really want to support and like but at the same time I'm not going to spend $11.00 for something that is barely more than a snack and isn't even that tasty. So it's a pass. The next time I want something nutritious and quick, I'll probably grab a salad at Fast Fresh. Kupfert & Kim advertises 'Wheatless & Meatless' but they forgot to include 'flavorless'. I want to eat healthy and I want to try and support different places but I also want to get my money's worth. Sorry K&K."}
{"text":"The Oaxaca is amazing!! A burrito bowl will never be the same after having it. The house made hot sauce is the perfect touch as well, just the right amount of kick.  The long line at lunch time flew by. There's someone who takes your order while you're in line and then you pay when you get to the register and it's about a 2 minute wait for your food.  Also had a PB & Cacao smoothie which was incredible. Not too sweet, and legit organic peanut butter. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I ordered the First Canadian Place through ubereats and thought it was delicious. My favourite bits being the flavour and texture of the tempeh, yams and maple chia sauce. I would definitely order this again. Even if you are a meat eater (as I am) try this food and you'd think you could be vegan vegetarian every day! (or at least once a week lol). Quite filling/satisfying."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here approximately 3 times per week (WaterPark location - which has virtually the same menu).  The First Canadian is by far my favourite box. It's sweet, savoury and healthy with ingredients like kale, quinoa, sweet potato, pomegranate seeds. If you don't like super sweet dressing, ask for the almond butter-lime dressing as a replacement.   Other recommendations include: Paleo box, Cauliflower box and the almond cookie (totally addicting)."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Spadina and Richmond, Kupfert and Kim is a great addition to the hood for healthy choices. I passed by this a few times but didn't get a chance to try it until today at lunch (i forgot to bring my lunch)...ended up ordering the cauliflower tahini bowl which worked well with everything else. Since I am on the Paleo diet, I was restricted to no carbs so I opted out of the brown rice and asked for extra veggies instead. I added Guac to my box. The hot sauce was quite interesting as it's not the typical hot sauce you see at most places...it had a slight after taste kick...which I enjoyed!  I also ordered the Blueberry smoothie and got the Green smoothie for my coworker...both were quite enjoyable. I personally liked the blueberry more..the green was a crowd pleaser when I asked one of the cashier but the first sip had a strong ginger taste..a bit too strong for my taste buds..  Prices are slightly higher than your average place due to quality. A place I would come back without hesitation."}
{"text":"Die Bedienung sah ungepflegt aus und war zudem noch nicht besonders nett. Wir hatten die K&K Waffle mit Blueberries, hat uns beiden nicht geschmeckt und hatte wenig mit einer Waffel zu tun. Die Café Latte war nicht besonderes....wie hausgemachter Kaffee mit Milch. Wir werden nicht wieder kommen."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is unreal. I do from time to time enjoy a Meatless Monday lol So my friend told me about this place and said it was the best vegan food he has ever had and he is a hard core meat eater lol So he took me down to the hustle bustle we call First Canadian Place and exposed me to this vegan GEM! The Lime green hot sauce is so delicious!!! I have had the OAXACA a couple times and its for sure my absolute favourite! The portion size is fantastic and so filling and its so colourful too lol You feel extremely clean after eating at this place and i never feel guilty for eating out when i have it ! The only downside to this Kupfert & Kim experience is that its in a food court kind of spot where theres no seating so you have to go to the real food court to find a seat lol but none the less thats a building design flaw i guess lol I highly recommend this to everyone! xo"}
{"text":"Wow. Please bring K&K to New York City!!!! I adore the Roasted Cauliflower Tahini bowl... so filling and fresh. Nice balance of sauces and veggies. Can I tell you how exceptional their flatbread is!?!!!! Crazy yum.  Going to purchase a bunch to take back home."}
{"text":"The line here at lunch is always crazy long and with good reason. Boasting wheatless, meatless food, even carnivores have to concede that the food here is delicious. Today I got the season.01 salad which has a great balance of acidity from the lemon tahini sauce and pickled beats, crunch from the yuca chips and broccoli, and overall freshness."}
{"text":"Nestled underground in the path amongst many underwhelming food courts is Kupfert. If you haven't yet checked it out, I suggest you do!  I come here quite often as I work right upstairs, but I'd also make the trek to come here even if I didn't. I tend to pay my visit in the morning for a kombucha and snack. They serve vegan and gluten free options that ACTUALLY TASTE GREAT! I say this because if you're anything like me OR are a meat lover, then you may agree that that's not always an easy task to make vegetarian, gluten-free food yummy. From experience I have found it to be bland and think to myself \"this tastes weird\", ha ha! So I must give them credit where it's due - they know how to make that stuff taste good!   I have enjoyed many items from here. Breakfast oats, smoothie bowls, salads... but my favourite little snack is their energy balls!!!   I'd definitely recommend checking this place out if you would like a clean, healthy snack OR meal. The staff are very pleasant and have great product knowledge if you aren't sure what you want."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I ordered the Oaxaca with quinoa and it was so scrumptious, fresh and tasty! I especially loved the hot sauce, which was fresh with just the right amount of heat. While $11 is a bit steep for a lunch, it's about what I'd expect for a salad bar of this calibre. A lot of the ingredients used are organic, and special attention is paid to ensure products are non-GMO. I appreciate the attention to detail and the healthy and sustainable approach K&K takes to their products.   They're opening a location at Queen and Spadina, which is dangerously close to my work, so I better hide my wallet! I'm hoping by the time the new location opens, I will finally remember the name of this place. \"Kupfert and Kim\" just won't resonate!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I went to hipster heaven. It was clean, organized, pristine, filled with really pretty people with meal concoctions that I am barely familiar with! There was folksy music playing on the stereo. This land is located in the bright, shiny section of the PATH, not grimy, dim corners that one encounters here.   I could not help myself and stepped inside, wondering if I would be asked special papers allowing me entrance.  Actually, I did carry such papers, called currency. I stared in wonderment at the limited display of choices. This worked for me because I could easily select what I would like to have for lunch. The Oaxaca is the quinoa and grains bowl that was most memorable.  But it was 3pm and I was in search of caffeine to curb my natural propensity to daydream. I ordered the hot cocoa, and felt enlighted ordering it, but it could have been a direct result of the bright white light in this section of the PATH. I first inquired if it was possible to make it with rice milk instead of almond milk b/c I am allergic to almonds. It had a much better taste than I expected.   In all seriousness, it is a welcomed entry to the busy and unhealthy lunch market that permeates the different food courts in the PATH. For a lunch bowl of $9.50, I think it is a fairly competitive price (see Fast Fresh Food for prices). I will try it for lunch one of these days."}
{"text":"was SO happy to finally check out kupfert & kim after months of waiting for its arrival. such a fun vibe to this place. bright interior with lots of light, nice graphics and a little bit of merch/ grab & go foods.   i ordered the burger of the day, which happened to be i believe sunflower seed and flax? it was served was some delicious pico de gallo and fresh avocado mash, on a bed of well-seasoned brown rice. my meal also came with some roasted yams and a really nice little arugula salad.   everything was very flavourful, fresh and well presented. took a very little time for them to prepare despite the busyness of the spot.   great value for money, i left full and very satisfied. will have to come back and check out the rest of the menu very soon"}
{"text":"Kupfert & Kim is a pretty great place for vegan food!  A friend of mine picked up dinner for us on her way over to my house. I had never tried Kupfert & Kim before, so I tried the Great Canadian bowl. It was really good! It had a nice balance of fresh, sweet, and salty flavours. The pomegranate seeds were a nice textural addition. My only complaint was that the tempeh was very salty. My friend agreed with my critique as well.  The menu is pretty wide so you can try many different things without getting bored. I'm really curious about the burger of day options, so that is likely my next thing to check out."}
{"text":"Just had their K&K waffle with maple syrup and fresh blueberries it was really good. We waited a bit for the table but the manager came and cleaned it off for us herself. The store was really busy but there was some good music playing and they have put a sheet in front on the doors to keep the cold air out. It was a really enjoyable lunch with my four family members. There is a lot of natural light inside and the paleo cookie was really good. By no means am I a vegan but either way I enjoyed my lunch !!!"}
{"text":"First, I am not vegan and I do love meat but if all my meals were from K&K I could be converted. I decided to visit this spot with my friend while touring downtown Toronto. We instantly noticed this flashy building and were intrigued. It is a take out style restaurant where you order at the front counter and are given the options 'for here or to go'. We chose to eat there and our food was brought to our table. The paleo bowl was outstanding. The hemp and sunflower balls were extremely tasty along with the mixed vegetables and sweet potato. The sauces were flavourful and complimented each other very well. I will definitely be returning to grab lunch here again and I recommend it to vegans and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and would go at least 3 times a week, but I've had to slow down on my usual favourites because I was getting a little fat. Even though it's meatless and wheatless (and generally very healthy) it doesn't mean it won't make your waistline increase with too much nuts, creams and protein.  This is easily my favourite location for work lunch, even though the Metro Convention Centre is literally across the street from my office. The staff is really nice and sometime they bump quality hip-hop while they work. Place gets insanely busy during lunch hours -- combined with a small space and you can imagine why you might want to avoid rush hour.  There's a lot of \"good stuff in a box\" type spots downtown, but this is easily one of the best. You get a lot of food for a decent price. Sure shots are the Almond Lime, First Canadian Place, and Cauliflower Tahini. Their peanut butter & mocha and vanilla cacao smoothies are also delicious, but if you combine that with one of their bowls your stomach will definitely expand.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good food in the area. I would consider it more of a lunch spot than dinner, though this location is open much later than the others."}
{"text":"I am only giving two stars due to the awful customer service and disorganization of this location. First off, I went to order and purchase my meal, and let the cashier know that I wanted hot sauce on the side, and asked if I can pay her up front for it. She said, \"not to worry there is no charge\". Fast forward to my meal being ready, and I asked the lady finishing my meal if I can have hot sauce on the side. She said no we don't do that. I said, the lady at the cash said I can, so she looked at another lady working there, and she also said \"no you can't have any sauce on the side\". I then politely asked if she can put extra in my container. She literally, no word of a lie put two small drops. I asked for more, and she put one more drop, and said \"is that fine?\" I just paid $13 for a meal, and I can't even get a little extra hot sauce? Not to mention someone else got my order who came well behind me, as they were disorganized and just screamed out the order, so because she got the same thing as me, she assumed it was hers. Perhaps if they do something simple like give you a number or take your name down, this would lead to less confusion. I am very unhappy because the food is actually excellent! This was my fourth time trying this location, and steadily I have been less impressed."}
{"text":"When you take care of your customers, they stay loyal. There are so many vegetarian only options in Toronto and these guys have expanded fast and always super busy. Regardless of all that, they still make sure each order is correct and do their best to make it right if it isn't.  As for the food itself, it's actual prepared tasty food, instead of just assembled combinations of random things i can buy at the grocery store (ahem, Fresh)  If you haven't already - you should try it out!"}
{"text":"Opened on Easter Sunday! Awesome!  You walk in, order at the front, sit and wait for your food. Take out or ritual delivery is an option as well.   I ordered the Oaxaca based on recommendation from the cashier. She said this was the most popular bowl. It was delicious! Like a Mexican taco filling, but with no wrap. Very flavourful! Only thing is, an ingredient, which I can't name was very spicy. It would be good if they advertised on menu that it would be spicy. Super filling and they have containers at the counter for you to pack it up if you can't finish it.   Almond rose milk: pretty good! Can really taste the almond and rose water. Only snag, pretty pricey - $9   Dragon well green tea - very flavourful. They give refill on water.   Great place to have a casual meal. They don't kick you out so you can spend hours with friends here!   They have a mix bag of coffee, desserts, mains, and even alcohol! Perfect for any level of eats!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Kupfert & Kim and finally had a chance to try their food. This place is gluten free and vegan friendly. They also have a lot of organic ingredients on their menu. I ordered the K&K Paleo salad. It was so yummy. My lunch looked like a rainbow.The kale was so fresh and crunchy. Hemp ball was so delicious. I don't like hemp because it has that weird flavours but I didn't find that taste in their hemp balls. I felt so nourishing after eating the salad.   The place looks interesting with their unique decor. Staffs are friendly and fast. Love this place and definitely come back to try different items."}
{"text":"Meatless wheatless, two things I am definitely not. However after endless weeks of subzero temperatures and the associated hibernation-like lethargy and comfort foods, I had a craving for something fresh and healthy and K&K seemed like a good option (bonus points that it could be accessed without having to go outside!).  I ordered the Kim box, which from the description had the potential to be amazing but unfortunately fell a bit short for me.   The fresh ingredients - pea shoots, cabbages, steamed bok choy, daikon, cucumber, edamame - were perfect and the almond chili kaffir lime dressing was deliciously inspiring.  The best part of the box though was the tofu, that was marinated in something awesome, but sadly they provided only two measly cubes of it. That coupled with dreadfully undercooked brown rice and \"hot sauce\" that was laughably mild ruined what might have otherwise been an experience worthy of the +$10 price tag.  That said, I would certainly give this place another shot should the urge for meatless wheatless strike again."}
{"text":"I've seen this place a few times and decided to pop in and order something 'wheatless & meatless' for a breakfast/snack/whatev.  So I asked whether the chia pudding (over $8) was a larger portion size than the other three breakfast items (approx. $5 ea.) or if it was more of the contents.. It was the contents because it came in a cup instead of in a bowl and it was tasty but I prolly shoulda got one of the others for more satiety..   I doubt I'll go back for lunch anytime soon since there's always a super long lineup.."}
{"text":"being vegan, i'm a big fan of k&k.   their bowls can be hit or miss though but most are good. very filling and very healthy.   their desserts are to die for! i dont love their coffee and would rather walk down the hall to sam james for a latte or cap."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after a tiring spin class. I'm glad we chose this place because dishes are super healthy but filling.  It's more of a fast-food setup in that you order at the counter (or via Ritual) and serve yourself. I loved the whole look of the restaurant, from the menu, to the decals, to the take-out boxes.  I ordered the poke poke, while my friend got the almond lime. Being a sushi lover, it was interesting to have a poke dish without the raw fish. However, it still tasted delicious with all the typical flavours, a common trait amongst vegan dishes I've tried.  We felt very satisfied by the end of our meals. I think the meals are decently priced, and would love to come back to try out some of their other stuff!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kupfert and Kim and was really excited to taste their food. After waiting 25 minutes for a kale salad with guacamole, brown rice, and pico de galo i was really frustrated. When i approached the workers they did not even know what i had ordered and was asking me questions. I found the staff to be very impolite in a situation like this, and did not even apologize for the inconvenience. Other people that had ordered after me had relied their food even way before. They definitely forgot to make it. The only thing i enjoyed was the food so i will definitely be returning to other locations but will not be returning to this one. Its a shame because this is the closest location to me."}
{"text":"A vegetarian recommended this place to me saying it was vegan, healthy and really good and a mainstay for her when coming to Toronto for work. I work in FCP and decided to try although I am not vegan or vegetarian but wanted to try something healthier. The place is excellent. Firstly service is very friendly and always upbeat. You do have to wait a little for your order but that's because they make most of it fresh. I went both for breakfast getting an americano and a chocolate banana muffin - both were excellent. Then I ordered the first canadian salad for lunch which was awesome. There are so many colorful fresh vegetables in here - rainbow radish, red cabbage, sweet potato, quinoa, tempeh, crispy onions and much more. I thought the tempeh wasnt great but everything else was terrific. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ate here several times during tiff. All options are vegan and gluten free so I was in heaven. The pesto quinoa was tasty but the curry bowl was too spicy. The blueberry smoothie bowl was satisfying. Their treats are so good....I had a chocolate muffin, hello dolly bar and paleo cookie at different times and enjoyed them all. I enjoyed their soup and seed flatbread a lot. It is pricey but worth it for the good, healthy food. I did see them prep orders for people that had called in their order....good to know for future.  They cater too!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE you guys!! The food is amazing!! But now that everyone else knows you need to streamline your operations. I waited for over 15 minutes for lunch today- and when it still wasn't even close to being prepped, had to get a refund and leave sad (and hungry). Please improve your service or, by losing (previously loyal) customers like me, the problem will right itself."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the specifics of my meal's healthiness or health factors (I'm more of a Popeye's kind of girl), but wow - if this is what healthy food tastes like, I would voluntarily eat it everyday.   I visited on a Tuesday at exactly 12:00 PM and the lunch rush hadn't really begun yet, thankfully. After seeing the pictures, I ordered the Oaxaca (which I was told is apparently pronounced OH-HA-CAH - I butchered it the first time).   I don't know how on earth they made the salad taste this delicious, but it was. Best \"healthy\" lunch I've ordered in the Financial District, filled with brown rice, black beans, kale, stringed beets, corn, tortilla chips and a mixture of pico de gallo, guacamole and cashew cream slathered all over these veggies. The sauce made the salad, and the combination of favours absolutely blew me away.  My total was $10.40 plus tax, which was $11.75. Can't wait to come back and try the other options!"}
{"text":"The staff are very personable, prices are pretty reasonable, and the food was fresh and yummy. If you're looking for a healthy/fuss-free lunch date, this is a great place. Love the interior design, that's what really drew me in."}
{"text":"Small menu, big lineups. That's because this is probably one of the healthiest places in the PATH (step aside freshii and iQ). They really know what they're doing here and they take it seriously -- meatless, mostly organic, largely raw ingredients. A lot of it might be unsubstantiated hipster health fads (like the gluten-free business.. I just don't buy it), but undeniably the ingredients (e.g. beets, hemp, chia, kale, quinoa, carrots, etc.) that they use are great for your body.  I've pretty much tried every item for lunch and I think the First Canadian is still my favourite, followed closely by the Season.01. I'm not a real fan of the spicier flavours that they have (so I never get the hot sauce, or the oaxaca). The taste is pretty good given how healthy it is, but don't be mistaken, you won't find this to be nearly as satisfying as say McDonald's or KFC. Can't have the best of both worlds, buddy. Serving sizes are quite balanced and sufficient for lunch without overfilling you or leaving you wanting.   I'll try the breakfasts one day. The new chia pudding that they've added sounds interesting (but pricey.. $9 for breakfast?! Wow.. but I guess chia is a premium ingredient). I've had the green smoothie before and was not a fan. The texture was too liquidy, I did not particularly enjoy the hint of mint, and it tasted just too \"green\" for me. I suppose the point of a supposedly healthy smoothie is to not overload it with fruit in effort to make it more palatable, but I just really couldn't handle the green smoothie."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with Kupfert & Kim. I think that every food court should have a place like this. I would 100% come back if I was in the area & recommend checking this place out!   It's a  food court counter kind of a place. They have an alright sized menu with lots of yummy meals. They have breakfast in the morning (I wish I had a chance to try because it all sounds mouth waveringly good!), lunch dishes, coffee, tea & really yummy treats! Everything I've had has been excellent & I would order again. I've had a few of there \"baked\" treats & they're amazing! I wish I was eating one now. I've also had the \"Kim bowl\" It's a good sized portion of healthy yummy food. You actually can get nutrition & energy from he ingredients to keep you going throughout the day,   The serves has always been ok, nothing to really ride home about but it's nice & basic. Meh, Kupfert & Kim is located in the Toronto path so they keep the service very quick & sweet. The line up can be large but it moves quickly. Can kinda get a bit overwhelming with all the people though. Sometimes you can't tell who is lined up & who is not.   Overall I think that Kupfert & Kim is worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious! But This location has some serious supply and demand issues.  80% of the time they cannot fulfill my order as stated in the menu because they are out or something or other and this is during the lunch rush, not at the end of the day.  VERY unreliable."}
{"text":"By far my favorite vegan / healthy eating eatery in Toronto.  I first came here a few weeks ago and asked  for the K&K paleo: roasted root vegetables, sunflower protein balls, organic arugula, organic kale, organic cucumber, purple cabbage, house-made sauerkraut, carrots, fennel, onion, dill, organic parsley, cilantro with tahini sauce and horseradish chimichurri  but they were sold out. So they called and asked another K&K if they could make one for me. I really appreciate customer service that goes above and beyond. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and felt rejuvenated after. I am so happy that they are opening new franchises around the city, so I can have it everywhere."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars only because the other locations of K & K were amazing. This review is for the new location in the metro centre. So disappointed.... First of all the portions here compared to the other locations are ridiculous, for 12 dollars I would hope for more than a pinch of kale for the base of my salad. The Falafel Balls were burnt. Maybe the people there need a bit more training but they rate so so far below the other locations it's almost like it's not even the same company."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderfully prepared, incredibly delicious and generously portioned.   It's an incredible top notch kitchen with spectacular staff and great customer service.  Unfortunately this manna from heaven acts as a magnet for a collection of the 'very special' humans of Toronto, each prodding for purpose as they fool themselves that perceived physical heath is tied to emotional well-being.    You see them from a block away.   A Canada Goose store come to life.   Blank faces and spin-class toned bodies blurring the reality between quinoa and quinine.    A modern day human dog show.  Nonstop bickering about mind numbing minutia and trivial psychobabble.     What is it about this spot that draws these people?      Is it the location?   Is it the menu?  Superb food.  But there's clearly a reason that the other outlets of Kupfert & Kim do not offer seats.   Best to get it to go.  Fast.   Thankfully they also offer easy ordering through UberEATS!"}
{"text":"This place was so good. The food was so flavorful and the hot chocolate (with cashew milk) might have been the best cocoa I've ever had."}
{"text":"I accidentally discovered this place, and it's quite a glutard haven. I have tried several of their menu items and I've been really happy with them all. I highly recommend their K&K Waffle. I can't believe how good it tastes considering it's gluten free. Their selection of baked goods doesn't blow my mind, but when you're GF you kind of are happy when anyone has offerings."}
{"text":"The service is quick and painless even during the busy lunch rush. Ordered the Oaxaca meal but by the way, this meal is around $10.39 which is really pricey for what they give you. The portions are actually really small.. You will be 40-50% full after eating this if you usually have a big appetite. The taste of the Oaxaca was okay but nothing outstanding. I don't see why this place is charging a premium for what they offer you. Probably won't try this again because the price is so steep."}
{"text":"Kupfert and Kim offers a great healthy lunch alternative in the PATH. I've had both the 1st Canadian and Season 1 bowls - both excellent and make a very filling lunch. That being said, there are a few cons.  1. I find it absolutely ridiculous that there are 6-8 people behind one counter and yet they are not more efficient at passing people through. At K&K there seems to be some inefficiencies that could they be sorted out, would make the experience much quicker and less confusing.  2. I love Kale smoothies for breakfast,  K&K makes a great one, but the first time I got it there was something 'off' about it.  I realized it would be much better (to my tastes) without mint.  So I ordered it without the 2nd time around and prefer it this way. This was NEVER a problem. The staff is 90% very friendly.    However, one morning (way before lunch rush, I was the only customer) one borderline-homeless looking male-staff member gave me a whole lot of grief for ordering without mint citing \"We don't really 'do' substitutions. If this was lunch hour, I would say no.\"  Not even a \"Sorry, hope you understand, is this an allergy?\"  First of all, I am paying $6.50 for smoothie.  Second of all, I am the only customer, paying $6.50 for a smoothie!!   You managed to accomplish nothing besides making me tell everyone in my office that the smoothie is much better without mint, and therefore they should order it this way, from you.  Hope being offensive and rude was worth it. Now PLEASE make me my damn smoothie."}
{"text":"Once I discovered the PATH and was no longer confined to the Sheraton hotel for breakfast I was glad I managed to find this place.  Both the oats and the quinoa breakfast bowls are great.  If I were to knock down to three stars it would be for the coffee.  Closest you can get to a regular brewed coffee here is an Americano, and for a latte all they have is non-dairy milks.  So next time I'd grab the coffee elsewhere but still get the breakfast here."}
{"text":"K&K changed my opinion on vegetarian foods and salads. I used to go to iQ, which I found difficult to go to even more than once a week because the food tasted so bad, and freshii, where I thought the quality of the raw ingredients were similar to that of Subway, in order to try and become healthier.  I think K&K hits a good balance between high quality and tasty food and food that is health conscious - the biggest downside is that I can't seem to find the calorie counts for K&K. If I could, I would be able to better plan my calorie intake.  It's been odd going meatless for over a week (and only during weekdays) as I have been going to K&K every day. My salad is the Poke Poke bowl (at $12.40 and it has tofu). There hasn't been a salad that I very much so disliked yet.  EDIT: My new favorite order from K&K is the Almond Lime ($11.50) - I ask for it with sauce on the side and no bok choi (which they replace with extra mushrooms!)"}
{"text":"This would be my favourite place in Toronto: their salads are amazing. During lunch hours it gets really busy but the food is so worth the wait! I especially love their First Canadian Bowl and soups. They also have amazing desserts, juices and latte with cashew milk. Would be coming back again! I wish I could eat here every day but that would would definitely be too expensive. Salads cost starting $12."}
{"text":"Ordered food from ritual app here a few times.    Service:  The food was ready by the time they promised, the waitress gave me a bag for takeout.    Food:  I am not generally a fan of vegetarian food, but found this place to be very tasty and filling.  I got the First Canadian Place salad, very satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been a couple times now and I've been pleasantly surprised both times. The portion sizes aren't huge, but I'm always more satisfied than expected at the end. I'm not always in the area, but when I am it's great to know I can stop by here for a healthy, tasty meal.   Considering how long their lines are, I'm always impressed with how efficient they are with moving people through. It's great to hear they will have extended hours, and I'm really excited to try more items on their menu. (The treats in the display case look really yummy!)  I highly recommend K&K and am really excited for the next time I can go!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I decided to come here because it had the shortest line in the food court. I understand why theres not much of a line -- its pricier than most other lunch places around. But its very healthy and I felt good eating it, but also delicious.   The salad bowls are the way to go. I got the oaxaca, which was delicious. I'm a carnivore, but this was very satisfying. The food came out pretty quickly and I was on my way."}
{"text":"You had me at breakfast all day! This is a fantastic restaurant if you are looking for healthy alternatives In the city. I liked the style of service in this restaurant. They have the quickest service especially around lunch time. It's a clean cafe with nice high seats (with no backs). When you walk in, you simply look over the menu at a table reserved with menus. Then you proceed to order and pay ( there is also a menu at the cash register which is a simple but necessary gesture). You take your number and sit at any table and display the number on your table. A server brings over your food minus the tipping expense. There is also a nice large pitcher of cold water in the corner with cups that you help yourself to if looking to skip out on the expense of buying a beverage. I had the gluten free waffles topped with maple syrup (it came in a little cute jar that I wanted to take home), and blue berries and raspberries. It was also drizzled with a coconut cream to mimick whipped cream. I wish the waffle was bigger though since I was having it at lunch time. I was surprised that after I ate my tummy was in so much shambles since this was a \"clean\" meal that I had. I believe it was the coconut cream on the waffles."}
{"text":"coconut milk matcha latte is unbelievable....with the chocolate muffin yum"}
{"text":"This place is officially become my regular.   Not only are they vegan friendly but it tastes amazing too so that's an added bonus. The employees are really nice and even if there is a line, you will never end up waiting more than 10-12 minutes for your food.  It's super cosy in the place and enough sitting area that you're not to worried.  I got their almond & Lime bowl which is my FAVOURITE like ever. I honestly have no idea whats in it but its good and that all I really care about. I also usually get their Banana and cocoa smoothie. so yummy.    They pretty much cater to anyone; most def a place to try out at least once. even if you're not vegetarian."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for work a couple weeks ago and found this place in a P.A.T.H. food court across the street from the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. This is the poke poke bowl, it was a little pricey (bowl + smoothie came to $23) but it was very filling.  Packed full of fresh veggies with brown rice and a huge glob of guacamole!"}
{"text":"Came to try what the hype was all about. There's a long line up (about 10 mins) to get food, if you're in a rush this may not be ideal.   I got the First Canadian for about $11 after taxes. All I have to say is that .. It is HEALTHY. I can't say I'm the biggest fan because my heart belongs to burger and fries, BUT I have to give it to Kupfert and Kim for having wholesome foods in their salad.. And a good variety too (hence 4 stars)!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, and I've gone to all their locations. But they lack customer service and consistency. They forgot the sunflower seed protein balls in my paleo box (discovered this after I walked back to my office which was 20min walk). I emailed them and no reply. Not even an acknowledgement even thought their auto email says they will get back to me as soon as possible (it's been 2 weeks). Also, although I love their cookies and cream with the paleo cookie, the girl who served it to me one time dropped the box on the floor and picked it back up and kept using it. Then the second time I came back another girl gave me one scoop of ice cream the size of a golf ball. I told them \"I've been coming here for a while and ordered this many times before and there was more ice cream than this\", after all I'm paying $7 for a cookie and ice cream. The girl looked at me and showed me the scoop and said this is what we always serve to customers this is the size of the scoop. No honey, not the day before, or last week, or the 5 other times I've ordered this at this location.  Needless to say, even though the food is alright, with poor customer service and no replies to complaints, I won't be coming back here even though I've been a loyal customer for about two years."}

{"text":"I've gotten the Oaxaca salad many a times. I'd say it's probably my favorite salad in the city (that cashew cream EEP!). It's pretty pricey for a take away place but the ingredients are always fresh and the quality is never compromised. They serve stumptown coffee and have some other good items, like power balls and cookies. I've also had their ginger lemon and agave concoction which was really strong and better than the one you get at Fresh. All in all a solid place with healthy and unique meals. Great find for a food court joint."}
{"text":"Got the first Canadian. It was skimpy and didn't reach the top of the box. I would skip it and go to urban omnivore instead."}
{"text":"This location is in the bright second floor food court at Waterpark. Much more pleasant than sitting in the basement. Food is both healthy and tasty, which is unusual. A bit pricey but that's because there's no processed institutional ingredients. I enjoyed my lunch and it was nice eating in natural light above ground for a change."}
{"text":"Very pretty, instagramable dishes that are very tasty too! Great portion sizes and very filling.  The waffles are so good with a coconut cream sauce.  Paleo bowl is my go to, but had a cashew soup once and it was extremely delish."}
{"text":"Food = excellent Vibe = pretty chilled Dessert = yes you must."}
{"text":"Nice place and relatively good hours, but most of the staff act quite rude, snobby, visibly rushed/stressed or all of the above. Pricey and often out of stock on some items.   Chocolate chip oat squares are awesome."}
{"text":"I tried Kupfert and Kim the other day for lunch and it didn't disappoint! I had the Oaxaca salad (obviously because it came with guac) and although it was expensive, it was very filling and flavourful. I want to go back to try some of their baked goods!"}
{"text":"We were downtown at the consulate and looking for a close place with vegan options. I really wish that Yelp made restos substantiate their vegan/veg-friendly claims because when you have lettuce etc.... that's not exactly what a whole food vegan is looking for.   There ARE healthy options here for sure however, not the most vegan friendly, especially where protein is concerned.   Coming from Vancouver, I realize that food is overpriced however, the value here wasn't what I was expecting either.   I also didn't like having to eat on the equivalent of an oversized ottoman.   Service was friendly/fast. Food was fresh."}
{"text":"Wheatless & Meatless... this is probably going to break a few people into hives just thinking about it BUT WAIT.  This place will really surprise you with flavour and actually make you full.    If you were looking for a great tasting and filling meal, this is a great spot.  It is gluten free and vegetarian.  You're still with me? It also seems to be home to all the yoga pants wearing Torontonians. I had no idea we were keeping lululemon sales up with this one block of millenials.  So even if you don't look the part of a curated Instagram yoga pant wearing millenial, you should step into this great spot and try it out.  So the restaurant is a fast causal place and it's just south of the Chinatown.  It's right at the corner of Spadina and Richmond.  Otherwise known as Spandex and Rich Man ... overheard that while in line.  It's a great spot as it has huge windows that let in the sunlight and lots of dog and people watching.  The place is pretty clean and has a fair number of tables.  It does get busy for Sunday lunch time as it was about 70% full.  Natural light caramel woods, large white wall swatches, and dashes of greenery are everywhere and it brings a warmth to the place.  The place is photographs amazingly.  Cauliflower Tahini Bowl - bright and colourful, this large salad bowl came with a lot of different shredded vegetables and a large roasted cauliflower.  It had carrots, purple cabbage, Lettuce, beets, radish, quinoa, green leaves, pomegranate seeds, seed crackers, and with a big scoop of hummus.  There was a of nice textures and crunch .... perhaps a bit too much? I got a large 3 inch carrot slice.  Overall, mixing it up with the tahini and hummus, you got a nice fresh crunch bite each time.  I barely could finish the bowl so it's a generous amount for a meal.  I liked it and wanting to try other ones to see how they are! 4/5  Zucchini Cauliflower soup - at first I thought this would be a bland mushy soup and I was very wrong.  It was a very creamy soup and full of zest with a good helping of spices and pepper.  They mentioned it had no cream either so for all vegans, this soup is perfect to get your body warmed up without feeling bloated or heavy either.  For the addition of $5 to the bowl, it was generous and huge portion.  4/5  What's not to love... great tasting food, healthy, generous portions, great space, and fairly affordable.  It's so hard to find spots like this in Toronto so when it's good, it's definitely a spot to keep coming back to."}
{"text":"A healthier lunch alternative to the heavy offerings at the Waterpark Place food court, if your wallet doesn't cry. The staff recommended the Oaxaca and K&K Paleo bowls as fan favs and I tried them on two separate occasions. I'm not typically into the vegan/gluten-free hype so I was pleasantly surprised that they both tasted pretty good and were decently filling - their ingredient lists had a nice balance of raw greens and cooked carbs/protein. While the dishes were lighter than typical fast food fare, they were seasoned enough that I was thirsty afterwards. I've seen others ask for less seasoning so that is a viable option. Overall it's good, but for $12 a takeout meal, I wouldn't go out of my way for it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for a quick bite during the day if you want something healthy sans meat, chicken or fish. I'm starting to eat more vegan food these days, so this place was a nice spot to indulge my vegan craving. For $11.75 I got an amazing meal, which looked like a $50+ dish at elBulli or something. It tasted great and I felt full afterwards. They give you a little metal flagpost, which indicates what you ordered...I thought it was cool and weird in a way.  Seriously, if you're vegan/vegetarian or just want something light and not \"too heavy\", you've gotta check out this place and try one of their dishes. The staff is friendly too. Oh, and I dig the decor. Nice job, guys!"}
{"text":"Best vegan bowl I've ever had. Also a nice store and atmosphere. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Recently went to K&K for lunch, ordered the 'Oaxacca' from a highly pleasant server, and was more than pleased with the food. Excellent, healthy and tasty lunch option. Never thought healthy food could be so delicious, quite honestly!"}
{"text":"Yummy friendly gluten-free! Great coffee with many non-dairy milk options. Was served by a French speaking staff. It's nice to be able to exchange in both languages."}
{"text":"Quick, clean, healthy options.  The treats are surprisingly good -- I tried the raw cacao vanilla energy ball and the chocolate chewy nut bar, both of which were chocolatey, chewy, and flavorful, but surprisingly oily too (probably all the nut butters); the paper bag was splotchy from the oils, but it tasted pretty good.  The cauliflower tahini bowl was less exciting though.  Nothing really wrong considering it's mostly raw veggies, and the cauliflower was pretty tasty, but there wasn't that much cauliflower, although overall it was a pretty hearty portion size.  I added a single falafel for $1.77, and it was not worth it.  That's pretty pricey for one falafel, but the bigger issue is the falafel was not good at all.  There was no crunch to the exterior, and the texture was really mealy and mushy and dense.  Perhaps stick to the juices and bakery items."}

{"text":"I can't wait to return to this place. So happy that it is all vegan, fresh, and oh so yummy. The portion sizes were great, the textures and sauces were on point, too. Happy to see them inspired by different types of cuisines. So flavorful and seemingly healthy. The staff was busy, but friendly. This place is great for non-vegans, too (my co-worker did not seem to mind the absence of meat).  The only bad thing about this joint was how slowly the water dispensed."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if people are aware that this place sells salad boxes - very similar to iQ but meatless. Been working in the area for a good 2 months and always thought they only sold baked goods.  Got the First Canadian box and it felt very fresh and clean. Had a whole bunch of quinoa, chopped up kale and cabbage. The maple dressing was something I looked forward to, but I found it tasteless even after using the entire container. I usually only use half of the dressing given, so that was a bit of a bummer. There's no meat in the box, but I was surprisingly very full from eating it and it lasted me until dinner time. For a meatless box though, it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Kupfert & Kim is a great place to get a slightly expensive salad, but it's totally worth it. I'm not a fan of salad, but when I'm feeling like having a healthy lunch, I'll get the First Canadian Place box.  I agree with Darrin, the lunch lines here are long as heck - but I just use an app and order ahead to skip the line."}
{"text":"Every PATH patron's favorite long lineup at lunch! Branded as \"meat free, wheat free,\" K&K has all kinds of delicious meals, snacks and beverages. Does a similar \"box of quinoa and veggies\" thing as iQ, but K&K seem to rely less on sauces and has the appearance at least of being slightly healthier. In any case, I'm hooked. It would seem a lot of others are too, as I've seen at least two new locations in the PATH sprout up in the last six months. Here are my top picks:  Breakfast - the housemade granola is incredible, with all kinds of crazy crap, fresh blueberries, your choice of milk, etc. The quinoa porridge is also great.  Lunch - the Kim is my favorite in their selection of quinoa/, with brown rice, kimchi and other Asian veggies. There hasn't been one I haven't liked though.  Beverages - if you need a quick breakfast, the peanut butter espresso smoothie is perfect. The green smoothie is refreshing and light, and the hot detox tea has cayenne, lemon and other stuff to at least give you the illusion that you're getting rid of any potential sniffles heading your way.  Snackz - Bunner's supersonic cookie. This cookie runs my whole damn life. It's delicious. Their little protein/energy balls and other baked items are also awesome. As one of those gluten-free people, I love having this option for a sweet treat available to me."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, colorful, healthy food though the portions are a but small. I tried a couple of the bowls, including a cauliflower tahini bowl and a Mexican -style black bean and guacamole bowl. Both were good but I was hungry a few hours later."}
{"text":"Not to sound like a broken record, but if anything close to Kupfert & Kim opened in New Orleans, I'd be on Cloud 9. I'd be taking out big bowls of deliciousness daily. I'd never cook again. Trust and believe. Man, when I'm in Toronto, I'm so spoiled by the access to fresh, divine vegan food from places like K & K and my very favorite, Fresh (twice in two days, and right across the street). I'm glad I ventured here today for a quick lunch.   I ordered the cauliflower bowl. Truth be told it contained way more shredded beets, purple cabbage and carrots than cauliflower (and the cauliflower was *so* good that I was yearning for more). The bowl is YUGE (#feelthebern) but I left half of it because I didn't love some of the veggies (Just too much of the raw, shredded stuff). The hummus and tahini are so good as are the greens (mint!! I'm in love with anything that has mint as a garnish!) and those nutty/grainy crackers are something to savor. They could leave out the kinda boring quinoa and it'd be AOK. So, I half loved it and left the other half. All good. This way I had room for dessert!  I consider this to be more of a breakfast and lunch place, due to ordering at the counter and the plethora of coffee drinks (I can't recommend their espresso drinks. I managed just a couple sips of it as it was really sour coffee, just not my thing), juices (swoon), smoothies and breakfast pastries (vegan, several raw and several GF options... I loved the decadent Hello, Dolly coconut and chocolate bar), in addition to 'dem bowls. Oh and unlike Fresh, they have free wifi, so this is an ideal place to work!  My piece of advice to you: Go with an appetite. You deserve all this and waffles & coconut ice cream (affogato, while you're at it), too."}
{"text":"It can be difficult to make health food taste good, but the line outside Kupfert & Kim during lunch hours is testament to just how good their food is. During my one month in Toronto, I tried everything on the menu and the workers probably know me by name.   The green smoothie is one of the best veggie smoothies I've had, with a kick of ginger with the pear, banana, and kale. It definitely tastes nutritious and is not for palates accustomed to sugary Jamba Juice smoothies. They offer a variety of bowls, each with an amazing dressing that pairs perfectly with the ingredients in the box. One of my favorites is the Oaxaca, which is essentially a kale and quinoa salad topped with Mexican toppings like corn, pico de gallo, black beans, and avocado. They include a cashew cream that's drizzled on top, and the nutty flavor is perfect with the spices of the bowl. I also love the Kim, which is a Korean-style bowl with bok choy and marinated tofu. With so many different kinds of vegetables and flavors, it's extremely hearty and leaves me full for hours.  With fresh and seasonal ingredients mixed  up in novel ways, Kupfert & Kim is definitely one of my favorite lunch spots and will continue to be long after I'm back in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Everything is great at Kupfert & Kim - wonderful, healthy, delicious food for your soul. This is food that nutritious your body. The staff are kind and helpful! The menu consists of a larger selection than the 1st Canadian Place.   Admittedly, it is slightly more costly than other offerings in the PATH. It is, however well worth the extra cost, especially for your health. There are also great muffins, cookies and sweets options to keep your belly happy and energy high!   Kupfert & Kim helps you go-on-and-on like the energizer bunny!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cauliflower Tahini bowl which consisted of quinoa & hummus for the base, cauliflower, carrots, salsa, cabbage, beets, mint, and pomegranate.  The quality is top notch and the mix of the variety of ingredients gave this bowl a punch! I ordered this bowl through the app Ritual so all you had to do was go into the location and pick up your order.  The overall restaurant is very small and usually packed during lunch so just be wary!  The only con I would have with this is that the portion size is pretty small so I was left feeling hungry after finishing."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find a Paleo-centric salad so when I found a restaurant offering such a selection close by I pounced at the opportunity to try it. I love the KK Paleo salad. It is ridiculously filling and packed full of nutrients and vitamins. The coconut sauce is incredibly creamy and adds a bit of liquid to the paleo balls that are dry but extremely filling. The restaurant is clean and orderly but avoid the lunch rush hour as the front can become packed with people trying to pick up their take out orders."}
{"text":"Super good AND super healthy! When I first saw wheatless and meatless I was a little nervous (even as a vegetarian!) but I was so wrong - everything here is ridiculously flavourful and they know exactly what they're doing! I've been here two or three times now and I love it - the roasted yams with the dip are the best! A little pricey, and the sitting area is a little small, but I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I mobile ordered an Almond Lime Bowl from K&K with instructions to substitute the cashews for sweet potatoes and have dressing on the side. When I went to pick up my order, I saw that they poured dressing all over my bowl.   \"Uhhh there's dressing on this... I can't really have almond dress on my food.\"  I gave the bowl to the cashier, and he promptly apologized and instructed the chef to make the appropriate changes. 5 minutes later, I see the bowl and it doesn't have the sweet potatoes. I bother them again:   \"Uhhhh where are my yammies?\"  Another few minutes of tummy pains from hunger and I finally got my box of food. Thank goodness.  Despite them messing up my order multiple times, I was quite satisfied with the food. Everything was portioned nicely, ingredients tasted decent, etc. The stir fry vegetables were a little on the oily side, which I did not expect (this is me being really picky though). But like many vegan, vegetarian places, the food didn't really blow me out of the water. That is, I'm sure I could have easily replicated the dish at home.  Overall, the Almond Lime Bowl is your typical GF, Vegan boxed lunch. The firm tofu was nice, the roasted yam was seasoned lightly, the mushrooms and vegetables were mildly sauteed to have flavours...Everything is healthy and wholesome - the actual individual components standalone taste fine, but the actual combination of the ingredients don't really come together.   Not a fan :("}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch and all I can say is that I love this place.  I ordered the burger platter and it was really tasty.  The ingredients were fresh and the burger tasted like any normal burger but with no meat which was cool.  Even their jalapeño pepper were delish cus they add a sweet taste which I enjoyed.  Definitely my favourite vegan place in Toronto.  Also the staff is so friendly and upbeat :)"}
{"text":"5/5 for many reasons.   Bomb food, spacious setting, lots of natural lighting, delicious juices and snacks = vegetarian must visit spot.   I got the K&K Paleo and it's this amazing combination of salad: sweet potato, spinach, coleslaw, some next level protein ball, mixed with delicious dressing. This is probably one of the best salads that's both healthy and actually delicious.   I also tried the banana bread - they are VERY generous with the portion when they cut it, oh and also it's delicious. I had the green juice to drink and it was this large glass of green deliciousness.   I also purchased one of their kombucha drinks to go so to be determined on how that taste :)   Will 100% recommend and I will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for your 'latte': We ordered a latte, a cappuccino, and a cortado but they were all the same - terrible. The coffee tasted burnt and it doesn't help that they only use almond milk. Ever tried to make a cappuccino with almond milk? It doesn't work.  When you charge top $ for your coffee - you better make it right.  Furthermore someone gave me a card defending animal rights because I was wearing my Canada Goose jacket - Apparently with permission from the restaurant. Really guys? Trying to make your paying customers feel guilty or something...?  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Summary: a bit pricy, small portion, healthy and good quality lunch place  This place is at busy corner near Spadina and Queen. I went to here for several times for lunch. However, I realized that every time I went to here the portion seems to get smaller and smaller. Compared to Freshii next door, this place is definitely more pricy and less portion. The food quality here is definitely good. However, if I want to a healthy lunch, I would probably choose Freshii."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Spadina and Richmond, Kupfert and Kim is a great alternative if you are looking for something healthy around the area. I've passed by this location many times to see it always full with people and finally got to try it myself.   I came by on a Wednesday morning around 10am. The place was fairly empty with plenty of seating available to choose from. Upon entering, a table with menus is within your view. You grab a menu, pick what you want, order at the counter, pay, and find a seat. Once your food is ready the employees will bring it to you. Since K&K starts serving their bowls at 11am, I opted for a blue smoothie bowl and an Americano for breakfast. Service was friendly/efficient and the food came out fast, no complaints there! I was also able to sit and relax for a bit longer as there weren't as many customers. Once finished and ready to leave, you can bring your dirty dishes to the counter.  This is probably my first time trying a smoothie bowl and it certainly won't be my last. The blue smoothie bowl was packed with healthy ingredients including blueberries, granola, chia/hemp...to name a few. The Americano was great as well.   Overall, great good and experience. Will come back to try more of their other menu items!"}
{"text":"100% vegan, gluten-free, you could almost say salad bar. Meaning all the food, all coffee, all granola is vegan and gluten-free, and surprisingly flavourful!  I eat anything, I'm not vegan nor am I gluten-free. I love food, I love when passionate chefs make art, I love to eat. Nonetheless I decided to have them make my lunch since I have already fallen in love with their latte and americano (beans by STUMPTOWN).  I usually order the daily specials as that's a tad cheaper and my favourite is their red Thai curry. Very very tasty! spicy!! full of veggies actually. As mentioned, you could almost say this is a salad bar. Their permanent menu items (called \"Boxes\") are a unique blend of flavours, all very tasty.  My boss joked if I had \"taken out a mortgage\" for ordering here."}
