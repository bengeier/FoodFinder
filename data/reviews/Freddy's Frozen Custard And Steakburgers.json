{"text":"I don't eat fast food anymore (not including places like in n out, 5guys, etc)... unless it's here. Good fries, decent burgers, love the Freddy's sauce, put it on everything I get except the custard. The custard is good too, but I don't indulge in it too frequently. I feel that this place is on a tier above the large fast food chains, but still beneath the in n out style burger joints.   Also, do yourself a favor and shower your fries with their seasoning!"}
{"text":"Better then in and out we come here from Scottsdale, they need to open one up there.  Steak burgers, smashed then, awesome fry sauce and good skinny frys.... Go for it !"}
{"text":"I love Freddy's! This is what a fast food burger place should be.  From the cheeseburgers to the frozen custard, it is fresh, hot, and first rate.  Even the string fries.  BUT, I do have ONE complaint.  Their grilled hot dogs.  They are Vienna beef, grilled, with any condiments you might want!  Why the complaint?  THEY ARE NOT HOT!  Even with dark grilling marks, the most heat I can get is slightly more than room temperature!  I have complained a number of times, even to managers.  Hot dogs should be HOT!  Maybe it's a 'just for the kids thing' ?"}
{"text":"Freddys is the bomb. I love their burgers and their shoestring fries. The best thing on their menu is the chicken fingers. Yumm freaking yum! And the trainer/ hot line cook/cold line kid is da bomb!! Austin rocks this Freddy's!!"}
{"text":"This Freddy's Customer service was incredible for a fast good restaurant, the menu was simple but far from boring and the next to no wait time for our delicious food was exactly what my family needed when meal plans at home didn't come to fruition. Burgers, Chicago dog and patty melt were delicious....now we'll have to come back to try their custard, on a non school night of course!"}
{"text":"Freddy's at Elliott and McClintock has only been open a few days and is looking to be a worthy addition to the neighborhood.  The burger was large and thin (having obviously been smashed on the grill); edges were a little crispy and taste was generally quite good. Cheese was melted between the burgers and added some moisture and what my eldest daughter likes to call cheesy goodness.  Fries were  a little disappointing.  While the meat seemed to be of good quality for a fast food place, the fries weren't thin enough to be crispy or thick enough to be tasty.  I don't put catsup on my fries, but these needed it.  They were dry and lacking in taste.  So four stars for the burger, one star for the fries, five stars for pleasant smiling service in a drive thru.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  Since it's new and I'm the first reviewer and I'm delighted to have a new dining option near my home, I'm rounding up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped by a Freddy's for the first and last time.  Ordered 2 SMALL HAMBURGERS and nothing else.  Asked what came on the SMALL HAMBURGERS.  Mustard, pickles.  Total was almost 7.75 with tax.  Took back my 20 and advised the cashier (who looked like she just smoked something funny) to check out McDonalds and Whataburger.  This was outright robbery."}
{"text":"I'm only writing this review because of the AMAZING service I was provided by the drive thru employee (glasses tall white guy) who made me feel genuinely happy for coming by today! Will definitely be back for a similar experience very soon!"}
{"text":"We came here to eat after watching the Lion movie across the street at Tempe Pollack Cinema. I never tried their steak burgers before and that's why we decided to eat here. It was a great experience from the moment we walked in, from their Customer service to the delicious burgers. The staff was very energetic knowing they had less than an hour before closing. I didn't feel like they were rushing us out at all but we were done before they had to close. While talking in the parking lot since Patrick was finishing his cig we seen a cardboard cut out of an old man inside Freddy's and thought it would be funny to take a selfie with. So I knocked on the door since it was 10 mins after they closed and had no problem opening the door for me to take my selfie haha and even the worker was laughing.."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you! There is NOTHING that looks or tastes like \"steak\" in this place. The burgers are very similar to IN & OUT burgers, only thinner, dryer and (perversely) burnt to a hard crisp around the edges. What a pitiful disappointment after finally stopping in to see what a \"STEAKburger\" is like! The shoestring fries don't even come close to the fries at McDonald's and a flame-broiled Burger King Whopper (if made correctly) tastes a hell of a lot closer to steak than these ultra fried thinburgers. Best chain restaurant burgers for my money are Red Robin. I cannot fathom all the people who think this food is good."}
{"text":"I have been eating here too much.  I tend to shy away from their regular burgers and go with either the patty melts or the hotdogs.  Both are excellent.  I really like their fries-they are probably the best fries I have had in a long time and are quite habit forming.  I think the price is pretty good as well.  For one of their combos, I think I paid around $8.50-pretty decent deal."}
{"text":"Smashburger who? Smashburger what? My first introduction to Freddy's was ... if you like Smashburger you'll love Freddy's. Soooo true! I like Smashburger but I LOVE Freddy's. I don't think I've ever had a burger as fresh, juicy, seasoned and delicious like this one from a fast food joint ever. Like ever!!   On the late night tip, I'll have to settle for In N Out, nothing's wrong with that but to have a Freddy's steak burger at 1 in the morning after a night of partying would be alllll love    The fries are good, I'm usually one to just care wholeheartedly for the burger so if I go with my mate we'll share an order of fries. I have yet to try the frozen custard because I'm so full from the burger. Next time I'll order a kids meal so that I can save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Went there to get some cheesy fries, and a chicken sandwich. Great service, and like always excellent food regardless of what you get at any location. My only reason for giving four stars is that for my simple order around lunch time (with no one inside or behind/ahead of me) it took them about 8-10 minutes for my order to be fulfilled. I won't complain too much since I know my food was fresh, but would have expected the time to be a lot less due to the hour of the day I went and that no one else was at this location.  I did not go inside and instead used the drive thru, so I cannot say what the inside looked like or have any comments relating to that."}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers were raving about this place. They live outside of Tempe but work here, so when they heard a new location opened up by work we all had to go. I've only had it once but man was it good. They don't look like much but they are really filling and absolutely delicious.   Definitely check it out!   I haven't had the custard but I hear its phenomenal and if its half as good as the burgers and fries the frozen custard is going to be amazing."}
{"text":"Had a patty melt and onion rings, loved them both! Im a big fan! Also ate half of my brothers Hawaiian sunday, very good!"}
{"text":"The super amazing employee ( Austin) made our Freddy's experience amazing. We appreciate the great service! We will definitely come back to this location. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I am not that impressed, the burger was small, fell apart and I didnt care for the fries.  At least I can say I tried it, but wont be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I don't have a lot to say but the 10 pounds I put on since they have opened near my office speak for themselves! Their courteous employees make all the difference. I don't think they know the word \"no\". Special orders do not confuse them, they happily oblige. That's the way it should be!"}
{"text":"Seems to be some communication issues with this location.    The cashiers didn't have any system on when to stop taking orders and when to start filling orders.  The manager on duty had no clue either and was no help.  The cashier also forget the order was to-go.   The custard is good stuff but this location needs improvement"}
{"text":"We have stopped here a few times with the family. The staff is very friendly and food is always hot and on point! Most recently I got the Cookie Butter Concrete and it was amazing! It taste just like those butter cookies smoothly blended in a creamy custard ice cream!! Yum!"}
{"text":"First and last time. The cook is unaware that patty a melt has cheese in it - making it pretty unattractive flavor- wise. But, as I sit here in Freddy's writing this review, it appears that the flies are loving my uneaten patty melt."}
{"text":"One of the only \"fast food\" places I will eat at. Freddys Steak burgers are super tasty. Their frie sauce is on point."}
{"text":"First time. Last time. This is a pathetic patty melt. It is supposed to be a double patty burger. What I received was a far cry from what I ordered. GARBAGE."}
{"text":"Just ordered the double steak burger, frys and fry sauce. They totally left out the fry sauce and the steak burger wad paper thin. Dry bun with no ketchup! Not going back!"}
{"text":"Freddy's has failed again.  Quality control is lacking, food is good one time and tastes bad the next.  Finally found that the custard and cookie sandwiches are consistently good.  Went there to buy four, told they were out but are making more.  Freddy's would not offer to go ahead and make 4.  Giving up on Freddy's."}
{"text":"YES!  I loved this place.  Had a double cheeseburger plain (bread, meat, cheese) and the flavor, texture, size was just perfect.  The peanut butter cup and banana concrete was super good.  My only complaint is cost.  It is quite pricey.  We ordered one burger, an order of 3 chicken tenders, a small milkshake, a small concrete and a small sundae.  Our bill was $22.  We had no fries, no drinks."}
{"text":"Every time I come on the service is excellent friendly the food is always fresh and fast it's a nice place to eat"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I've been coming here since they opened. The manager that moves between stores is SO friendly. The staff is always great. Really some top notch people working here. Everyone working is always in such a good mood that I assume the employees are treated as well as the customers."}
{"text":"How sad, I expected a bit more in flavor and goodness.  Had their California double burger combo.  The fries were abundant but cut so thin (shoestring) you couldn't taste the potato and had to really work at stuffing your face to get enough with each bite of burger.  My wife ordered a combo (single) and some chili cheese fries.  They came in a huge mound covered in lots of cheese and chili.  The chili was meaty but bland and the cheese had little flavor.  The burgers couldn't be tasted under all the toppings and ketchup. I would rate their burger about average for fast food places.  Now the soft freeze was tasty, I should have tried the cod fish instead of the beef.  The pink lemonade was good. Overall, not a lot of value here."}
{"text":"Great food. Yummy veggie burger and my husband had a great California style burger. Fantastic service and really friendly. They had the skinny shoestring fries too which was a nice treat. Highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"This place was so bad. Service was slow. We got the single burger, fries & chocolate shakes. The burger was paper thin. No really no exaggeration. The fries were good but the sauce was just thousand island. The shakes were so thick you couldn't use a straw there are so many better burger places. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I really really love the custard at Freddy's.  It's so creamy and they have a ton of creative flavor and ingredient combinations to choose from.  The burgers are quite good, but the meat itself is super thin and crispy because of the way they smash it on the grill.  That could be improved, but the overall flavor is great."}
{"text":"My wife had been wanting to stop by and check out Freddy's. The menu was simple and easy to read. The staff was very friendly. I ordered the #7 Bacon and Cheese Double Steak Burger. My wife has the #4 Single Burger. The food reminded me of Smash Burger but the food at Freddy's taste much better. The restaurant and the tables were clean. The food came out quickly and it was all fresh. For desert I tried the PBC&C. It is made  with custard, chopped up Reese's peanut butter cups and small slices of banana. I liked the custard here more that at Connies. We plan on coming here again!"}
{"text":"The food is WONDERFUL and the STAFF at this store is even better! I have been coming to this Freddys since it opened...usually thru the drive thru....and I have NEVER been met with anything but a smiling staff and hot..fresh food! They cook to order and it is delicious!! I am ADDICTED to their hotdogs on grilled garlic toast!! The staff remembers your name...and even where I work!....and make great conversation while you are waiting for your food!  I actually stopped going to another competitor due to their staff was never friendly and I felt like I was imposing on them!!! you will NEVER get that feeling at this Freddys....locals and tourists ... you will LOVE the food and the ambience!! 5 stars!! :)"}
{"text":"Really good! The Freddy's Original Double never lets me down. If this stuff is frozen before they grill it, it sure doesn't taste like it. The only constructive feedback I can offer this place is in regards to the fountain drinks. They tasted less like soda and more like flavored carbonated water. Other than that, I had a good experience here."}
{"text":"We mainly go for the fries because they really are good, especially if you're into thin shoestring type fries. The burgers are standard, not the best I've ever had but definitely better than steak n shake. It feels similar to Culvers in terms of being overpriced and small portions. But the taste is pretty solid. We'll be back, for the fries if not anything else. Wish there were locations nearer to ASU."}
{"text":"The name describes in perfect order what I liked best. Frozen custard over the steakburger. My girlfriend and I rolled in at about 10:30 after a 2-mile run determined to completely throw away the exercise we had just done. We landed on the Turtle concrete mixer based on the giant sign hanging above the register, which called to me like a sirens song in the night. It's aura of deliciousness was too enticing to pass up. Next I decided to add a steakburger to the order because I felt it was essential to complete the full, first-time experience.   When our order arrived at our table just a couple of minutes later I noticed the burger looked a little greasy, but what the hell, I dove right in. I found the burger to be overly salty and left something to be desired flavor wise. As for the concrete mixer, due to the temperature of the hot fudge they threw in it turned out to be more like a glass of chocolate soup. I would have expected this if I ordered a fudge sundae, but it's not really what a concrete mixer should be. Overall, the flavor was very good.   The staff was super friendly and helpful and I enjoyed the decor, but honestly I was hoping for a little more from this place."}
{"text":"We went there for the Frozen Custard not the burgers, which smelled delicious.  The custard was delicious and we loved the 'concrete'!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've come to this location a couple times and arrived back at home with the order wrong.   They're quite pricey too, so when you drive off with your order you expect them to get it right. The burgers are okay, the fries are good, the frozen custard is pretty good too. Most recent order was a frozen custard with brownie pieces.  My cup came out with the brownie pieces in the bottom of the container and the custard was simply filled on top of the brownie.  I thought the additions were mixed in. I know you're not supposed to make assumptions."}
{"text":"The crew at this location are always upbeat and friendly. Always greeted with a smile. Service is great, food is great. If you only get one thing (and good luck with that as it all smells and tastes awesome) get the frozen custard. SOOO good!"}
{"text":"Needing quick fast good and saw the Yelp! reviews and had driven past a few of these.  Really a cut above fast food.  I had the regular chocolate shake and especially loved the wider straw that they use, and missing my favorite Varsity at home but not too hungry, ordered the hot dog with mustard, catsup and relishes.  My wife went for the Tropicana lemonade and the chicken nuggets with honey mustard.  Glad we stopped in and will do so again!"}
{"text":"I always drive by this place on my way home from work,  so decided to stop by.   Ordered the double bacon burger combo with shoe strong fries,  and it was completely impressed.   First the burger,  the meat was tender,  and the lettuce,  tomato and pickles were all fresh,  a pretty good feat considering I went there 20 minutes before closing.   The burger meat was pressed thin and cooked perfectly,  and had great flavor.  The fries were shoestring, cooked nice and crisp and salted to  perfection.   I can't wait to go back and order another burger,  but next time,  I'll try some custard too."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place the cheese burger was thin but pretty good i really like the shoestring fries and the frozen custard rocks il go again"}
{"text":"I've been here a few more times and have been impressed with the friendly speedy service. The burgers are a step up from other fast food type burger chains with a slightly crisp exterior and juicy meat. I think the best burger to get is their double California steakburger due to the balance of burger, toppings, and bun. Other items I've had such as the patty melt and the Hatch chile burger have been disappointing. The shakes are pretty tasty since they are made with frozen custard. Upgrade one star!"}
{"text":"First time trying Freddy's tonight. I wasn't that impressed. I ordered the California style steak burger. I felt it was lacking flavor. The patties are very thin. When I picked up my burger the edges were so crispy that they just crumbled and fell off. In my opinion the burger was just ok. I would give them another try. The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Two words: Fry sauce! Place is clean, people are nice, burgers are good. What else is there?"}
{"text":"Love the cheeseburgers here with thin patties that are Crispy along the edge. Super skinny fries with the \"freddy's\" Jalapeño fry sauce,  I think it is just ketchup plus mayo with some spice but I like it. Luscious creamy custard for dessert.  Next time I am trying the peanut butter crunch custard. Staff couldn't be more nice and helpful. Wish they had one in Scottsdale. Hint hint."}
{"text":"A manager here once told me, they were patterned after Steak 'n Shake, I would believe it because it is delicious, the smashed burgers are crisped perfectly and the fries are as well."}
{"text":"Being from St. Louis and having Ted Drews and Bobby's custard finding the is gem for yummy custard in Arizona  is awesome.  This location is walking distance to my house and always friendly service. Will make this a weekly treat stop. I can't say much for the food since were not really burger and fry types. But the custard is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very clean, kind of has that old school throwback look but still modern.  Cusard is really good, food just so so and service was good."}
{"text":"I ate a burger at Freddy's way back when and it was good, but the custard is what brings me back!  It is so tasty, I just like it plain in a cone.  Vanilla, Chocolate, or swirl... it is all sooo good :)   It always smells good... greasy fries and burgers.. you can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Great custard, good sandwiches. Much better than fast food. If I'm going to splurge, the food has to be great and Freddy's definitely qualifies."}
{"text":"Another reviewer who was also unsatisfied with the new mini Steak n Shake in Tempe suggested Freddy's.  WOW, what a nice surprise to have a steakburger that tastes great, fast and friendly service and a clean restaurant.  The menu is three to four times bigger than S & S.  I have been there twice now and was pleased every time, as were my friends.  Good Job!!!"}
{"text":"Thier ice cream is delicious, but their sandwiches are always extremely greasy so the bread gets soggy and gross"}
{"text":"Love Freddy's. The burgers are awesome, and I like the California style a lot.   I cannot believe someone would give a 1 star rating because they cannot read the price on the menu. That is pure ignorance. They basically rated their own reading comprehension.   Freddy's staff is always friendly and go a long way to make sure you are more than satisfied with your meal."}
{"text":"C and I were looking for a burger and had been wanting to try Freddy's for awhile. Now was our chance. The inside was fine. I guess it felt more like an In N Out than let say a Smashburger or Five Guys. No problem with the interior, temp was right and the tables were clean. The menu is pretty straightforward. Starts with the burgers. Single, Double or Triple patties. There's also a Patty Melt and Veggie Burger. Plus Grilled Chicken Sandwich, hot dogs, Fries 3 ways, kids meals and of course, Custard. We walked up to the counter and they young lady greeted us politely. I told her we had never been to Freddy's and she proceeded to explain the menu to C & I. Once C figured out what he wanted off he want to grab us a booth.  C got the Kids Cheeseburger meal ($5.09) Seriously a good deal. His burger looked almost the same size as mine. C ordered his Medium and it came that way. He ordered his with just cheese and pickles X 4 on the side (that's pickles, pickles, pickles, pickles. Not 4 pickles) and he got fries as well. When he was done I asked him if he would prefer one of the other places around to get a burger and he said \"nope\", this was one of the best burgers he's had. Kudos. I ordered the Single Cheeseburger combo ($5.99). I got mine Medium Rare, which it was. The bun tasted fresh, the meat was properly seasoned and really the whole burger was just dang good. Winner winner Cheeseburger dinner. My fries were hot, not overly salty and tasted great. I had to agree with C, this place does one very tasty burger. And for the price, it beats it's competition, hands down. Clean facility, reasonable prices, tasty kids meal, tasty cheeseburger, pleasant staff. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Came here late at night- we were the only ones in there. The staff was outstanding and the food was even better. Everything came out piping hot, fresh, and made to order. Portions were huge, which was to be expected given the prices. We got a steakburger and a chili cheese dog. The chili and cheese were a perfect combination. The custard is incredibly delicious and is a must-have at every visit. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  This is basically restaurant quality fast food.  Amazing!  Great hot dogs, great burgers, great pickles, amazing french fries..  Chili, cheese sauce, fried pickles, fried cheese curds, all great.   A good restaurant can be judged based on their pickles and Freddy's is on point. Everything here is delicious!  The employees are probably the best part of this spot. I've seen familiar faces for years so they are clearly treated well, and customer service is absolutely flawless."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff member in black shirt. I think that makes them lead or management. I reported to corporate. Won't be returning to this location ever again"}
{"text":"Q:  What do you call a cow with no feet?  A:  Ground beef.  Whomp whomp!  So Freddy's is very much a fan of the smashed burger patty.  Nice char, good amount of seasoning but I wasn't too crazy about the burger.  That burger just fell apart in my hands.  They serve up their own signature fries sauce which I can get behind.  They also sell their fries shoestring thin so if you're a fan, you'll love these.  I had ordered my fries with cheese sauce and the fries surprisingly stayed mostly crispy when by all means, given the amount of cheese on it, they should have been a soggy mess.  I think I'd skip out on the cheese sauce though.  The fries sauce was much more enjoyable than the liquid cheese.  Two combinations came out to be $19-something.  I haven't had their frozen custard but it certainly looks delicious.   The food is decent, the staff is friendly, and the lobby is clean.  Like all Freddy's, they have that old school charm.  What more can be said?"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely fantastic... It has an owner named Rick who runs the Chandler mall location as well. They have a spectacular product but it is there cleanliness, attention to detail and customer service that sets them apart from other locations. Very friendly and I will come back over and over again"}
