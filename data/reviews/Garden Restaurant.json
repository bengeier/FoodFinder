{"text":"I generally eat here 2-3 times a week. By far the best place in Brookpark to get breakfast. Hearty, fresh portions at good prices with good service. I usually go with the western omelet, but they have very good french toast as well. Their hash browns are awesome. They are pan fried red potatoes. You could say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Love the food.   Fast service.  Sometimes too crowded to get a seat. Recommend spicy shrimp and vegetable fried rice."}
{"text":"I don't know if they were having a bad day or what but the food we ordered was greasy and awful  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I work nearby so this is a constant quick lunch favourite of mine and my coworkers. If you are looking for simple chinese take-out, this is the place to go.  I usually order their roast pork on steamed rice, but if you do not get it before 3:00pm they tend to run out before dinner service begins. The roast pork is a good mix of meat, fat and crispy skin, just be careful not to accidentally bite down on the bone...it is an unpleasant experience.  The decor is nice, but I have never sat down for a meal, so I cannot comment on the ambiance or service. Although the cashier can be a tad unresponsive from time to time.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I did not expect sauteed garoupa to come in \"cum\" sauce. But the fried chicken was tasty."}
{"text":"Horrible.  We sat down and immediately I spotted something sticky on my silverware.  So I gave it to the waitress who snatched it off of the table as if I did something wrong by complaining.  She took our drink order, left as if she was going to get our drinks, came back and asked if we wanted our drinks before we order.  What a weird question.  YES!   So she came back with the drinks and gave us 1 straw per person to share with our water and pop that we ordered.  Oh and it was like pulling teeth to get a refill.  She acted like she was gonna throw something every time I asked.  We proceeded to eat, I reached for a napkin off of the other place mat beside me and the napkin was stuck to the place mat.  The salad bar beets and the pasta salad were slimy.  I ordered a ruben which didnt come with thousand island dressing oddly enough so I asked for some...the waitress came back and said they were \"looking\" for it.  Sounds like if they cant find it, I dont want it.  It finally arrived when I was done with my sandwich.    My onion rings were so over-done that there was no onion left.    They ran out of menus and were telling people to SHARE!!  It seemed so disorganized and chaotic.  The bathroom reminded me of a gas-station stop...Oh and the toilet rocked when you sat on it.  Low and behold today, my fiance is SICK.  Surprise, surprise.    We dine out A LOT, and this was one of the weirdest, nastiest places.  Good luck getting out alive.  Highly NOT recommended."}
{"text":"I think I may have ordered the wrong things, but I was rather underwhelmed by my experience here, and probably won't go back.  The service was great, but frankly I doubt people just picking up food would care. Anyways, I ordered Shrimps in Lobster Sauce, Beef with Ginger and Onion, House Fried Rice and Chili Chicken.  The Shrimp were really good, I recommend it, it had a nice eggy sauce and a tangy flavour, and the shrimp were nicely cooked. Order this.  The fried rice was actually quite good, but you can get really good fried rice at lots of places so it doesn't score that many points.  The beef was bland, really bland. I was expecting it to have been marinated but I suspect they just boiled or deep fried slices of beef and threw ginger and onions in the bowl. I suggest leaving this for a couple of days int eh fridge to let the flavours set in, then it is pretty good. I found it overly salted too, even for a Chinese place.  The Chili Chicken was... interesting.. it was on a bed of these strange styrofoamish noodle sprout thingies. I don't really know what they were. the chicken was good, but I found the dish to be dry, could have used a sauce or less strange noodles.  Overall it was ok, it is a little pricey so I don;t think iw ill go there again very soon. All I can say is that the chef and restaurant specials were good, but the other stuff wasn't so maybe next time I will learn my lesson."}
{"text":"Food was very good and flavorful. Service was mediocre. Decor was basic but functional. I would go back because of the sweet and sour shrimp and chicken lo mein."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. (Debbie was awesome.) I had the BEST omelette-- fluffy and delicious. They do a 4-egg omelette, so be prepared to eat. A must for breakfast and brunch. Our bill for 2 people was $16. I can my get out of McDonalds for that, and this was outstanding."}
{"text":"The only reason why the Garden Restaurant is worth checking out, is because it's open late (we went for dinner there at 12 am on a weekday) and because you can get vegan friendly chow. If you aren't going there because you need grease in the wee hours of the morning, I would avoid this place.  Numero uno, it isn't real chinese food; numero deux, it is greasy as all hell, perhaps even too greasy. We felt absolutely disgusting after dinner.  The food arrives quickly because all the stir-fries are made with frozen vegetables. Several items we ordered from the menu were not even unthawed or the noodles were burned. You don't come here for a culinary delight. It's also waaaaaayyyyy overpriced for what it is.   If you aren't vegan and want a late-night chinese food experience, I recommend walking over to China Town which is just a stones-throw west."}
{"text":"Great Place after Midnight.   This place gets rocking late at night Midnight to about 5AM. At other times of day it is a 3 star place but at night it is 5star. Why because  they are moving so much seafood so fast that you are getting fresh food. Highlights are \"Shrimp with Eggplant and Lobster sauce\", \"Spicy Fried Cuttlefish\", \"Steamed Oysters in Black Bean Sauce\" \"Spicy Fried Squid\", and \"Singapore Style Vermicelli\". I've followed the Garden through 3 locations and the new one is the best yet. Decide fast on your food when you are seated, and service is ultra fast.  This is a great place, Go Late, that's when they shine."}
{"text":"I order steak, the steak is too dry and veggie is overcook, too soft and salty. It is family restaurant, taste so bland."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I prefer to find restaurants that aren't franchises. That one if a kind place is to be coveted. My chicken fried steak, sausage gravy, 3 eggs, hashbrowns, toast & coffee were spot on good!  I asked that they make my hashbrowns very dark brown and crispy and they did. Many won't do that. They followed instructions. I would definitely recommend this place. The help was just right."}
{"text":"I've eaten my share here throughout the years. Though I'd like to give them points on nostalgia (I used to eat here practically every day at my first summer job), I'm evaluating based on food only,  they can make a mean beef with bok choy with rice combo for lunch but for the rest of the dishes they are just A-OK or below average.  Nothing close to the grade one can receive at Congee Queen."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other day, with a party of 4 people.  We ordered 6 dishes, and the food was server promptly.  The waiter was informative as we had some questions about some of the dishes.  The quality of the food is good.  No MSG is used in the cooking and not much salt is used in the dishes.  However, if you wanted more salt, you could always add soy sauce or other seasoning.  I like this idea, as it allows you to decide how much sodium you want in your meal.  The only complaint that I have is that once all the dishes have been served, the wait staff are not attentive to the table to see if everything is good.  In my experience at authentic chinese restaurants, this isn't an uncommon occurrence."}
{"text":"I was warmly greeted on a cold January day. Having just lost my dog to cancer, The greeting was particularly welcomed. I ordered a western omelet with wheat toast and asked for a mild hot sauce. The omelet was served warm and welcoming, every bite melted in my mouth, and the rush of savory filled my soul. The toast was expertly toasted, butter melting uniformly over its surface. I added a nice pad of Smuckers grape jam to its surface, and I felt as if I were back in France for just a short minute, a welcomed escape. My waitress was sweet and savory as well and never let my coffee cup get below a half... Expertly played. I tipped her 20% given her expertise and attention to detail. My visit was excellent. As I left, I was called out by name and told that it was a pleasure serving me, and I responded in kind and then thought to myself that making the arrangements for my recently departed soul mate would be less of a burden as I rejoiced at the goodness that was shared with me today."}
{"text":"Ordered a ton of take out. It was ready really fast in having it prepared for us, good price, food was pretty good.   Ill be going back for dine in. When I was there it was odd to see a minority of Asians in this place but oh well."}
{"text":"Good food, large plates, affordable price, and most importantly, opens till midnight! The fried fish meat with vegetables is good, and the hunan beef is not spicy for a hunanese."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch a few days ago with colleagues. This place is pretty good Canadian-Chinese food. The staff are quick and efficient while not being particularly friendly (which is fine). No dish stood out particularly, but it's a decent Canadian-Chinese food joint if you're in the area and want something cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Growing up in the city, it's safe to say I have dined here at least ten times. I must admit, I'm no longer a customer here (better option down the road). Why? Their lunch and dinner menu. I have been burned by their pasta, meatloaf and chicken paprikash. I found them all to be below par (to put it nicely). Each dish that was ordered was recommended by the server 'it's so good' which makes it even worse.   They still deserve 3 stars because their breakfast is good and cheap. And the owners are Greek (we stick together). No, but seriously, the salad bar is good. Every time I have come here and had the salad bar I have left happily stuffed. Honestly, I'm not much of a breakfast person, when we go out to breakfast I'm that girl who orders pot pie or chili. So that's why I don't find myself eating here by choice, but if you are a breakfast person and in the city, give them a chance. Everyone I know seems to love it here."}
{"text":"The Garden is alright because it's cheap and quick. I found the BBQ dishes (pork, duck, and soya sauce chicken) just ok. I've definitely had better BBQ in Chinatown proper and Scarborough/Markham. Beware when ordering a \"medium\" or \"large\" sized duck/chicken. They told us the medium was a half a duck and the large was the entire duck, but they were definitely missing some pieces, such as the breast and wing. We figured they used those part for the \"small\" or combo with rice dishes. I don't like the white meat anyway, plus $8 for a half a duck would have been pretty cheap so I wasn't too bothered by it but some of my BBQ afficianado friends were quite offended.  I think it was slightly cheaper than Spadina Garden down the road and nicer decor than Yueh Tong across the street, so I might go back to try a few other dishes, but otherwise I wasn't really impressed."}
{"text":"Seated quickly on a Sunday morning around 10am, food came out quickly as well, and was fantastic.  Plenty of food for pretty cheap cost as well, we couldn't even finish everything we ordered.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a couple times, but mostly its the 2-3am food stop after drinking and clubbing.  I used to think it was really good but lately its ok.  Food is good, and decent prices.  But there are other options."}
{"text":"There's two hotels beside this restaurant, I woke up in one of them after a night of heavy drinking.  Garden restaurant was at the end of the street, which was as far I could get on two feet at the time.  Good enough!  Very discrete sign, tinted windows, small entrance.  I must have came here around 1pm on a Saturday morning, and for the state at the time, this place was too nice.  Very clean, contemporary décor with smartly dressed service staff.   I was with these two ladies that I met only a week ago, and this was our first time partying together.  I struggled to hold myself upright, I must have looked completely pathetic.  They kept giggling at me, probably making fun of my utter lack of sobriety. We ordered the chicken!  Chicken fried rice, spring rolls I think, some beef dish and A LOT of tea.  The table wasn't wobbly, but it felt that way.. It took me ten minutes to realize that I was actually eating the food.  There I was, chewing away at what was in my bowl, but it was nothing special.  Having a hangover doesn't mean I lose my taste for food, yet what I ordered lacked flavour.   The sobering properties of the tea began to take affect, but the food remained unremarkable.  I was impressed by how clean and efficient the staff here were, I remember seeing a majority of black & brown.   I was just glad that at least nobody on the street could see pass the tinted windows at my sheer pitiful state.  The girls were nice, and paid for the meal, knowing full well that I was in no shape to count.   I think the cheque came out to around $40.    Next thing I remember was sinking into the back seat of someone's BMW while I felt someone's fingers massage at the back of my scalp.   When I woke up again, I was home in my bed holding a takeaway box, and a huge spinach between my teeth.   I heated up the left overs, not so great.   I'm still friends with these women, because you know..this is how friends are made."}
{"text":"This place had the BEST CHILLI CHICKEN Ever!!! Disappointed that they closed down, it was one of my favourite late night eats. FYI Hong Shing which is in the same area makes a pretty close version of their Chilli Chicken."}
{"text":"Service was great and for a little neighborhood type restaurant it was a good experience.  The food was great and we would go again when we are near that part of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just before the holiday season my Toronto CM counterpart and I decided to venture to this spot for a little pre/post work day chow. From the reviews we had anticipated an average place but what we found was anything but...  From a decore perspective I'd say the place was far better than any average joint (trust me I've dined at some sketchy joints in my day) but with high ceilings, partitions separating the different areas of the restaurant and lots of windows, Garden was a surprising little oasis along Dundas!  But what about the food? Yum Yum Yum simple dirty-cheap, Chinese food. Nothing dirty about the food quality though it was top shelf through and through (And I think at this point I'm able to distinguish the good from the bad, and the ugly).  Here is what we dined on that night:  Hot and Sour Soup to share - this was one of my first times with this dish and I actually really enjoyed it! I'm usually a Won Ton soup kinda guy but this chaned my opinion for sure!  Cantonese Chow Mein - this is my fav dish no matter where I eat and they did it just to my taste with all the noodles perfectly cooked and plenty of meat and veggies!  Pork Fried Rice - not ym fave dish but the rice was moist and there was a good amount of pork mixed in with the rice so this dish gets a thumbs up from me!  Spicy Beef with Chinese Broccoli  - All I can say is I LOVE CHINESE BROCCOLI!!!  The bill was reasonable for all that food and we both left stuffed!!   Pro-tip: Pay at the front they don't take your payment at the table!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Garden Restaurant for its chinese bbq, possibly the best in downtown outside of Spadina. The duck is absolutely delicious (and I know what's good stuff), the crispy pork is to die for and the char siew is classic. Excellent value for money!!!! I and my friends were there 2 years ago for the chinese new year dinner and was not disappointed. I keep on going back there for the bbq and haven't tried anything else."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine recommended me this place so i thought I would give it a try. I went during lunch time and I'm not really surprised that the place was Packed! Due to the fact that the location of the specific restaurant was conveniently located at the heart of downtown Toronto. Too bad the food & service didn't live up to my friend's hype. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a table. Anyways, the decor is not bad, not good. It was average. One thing that is good is that they have tainted windows, so the \"creepers\" from outside of the restaurant won't peek through and make funny faces and so on.   The food was OKAY, the food that I ordered was: Spicy Chili Chicken on rice, Crispy Spring Roll and a can of Coca-Cola. The Crispy Spring roll is really oily, that it gave me a headache after eating it. The Spicy Chili Chicken on rice was good and I enjoyed it. It was really spicy for my taste (this is coming from a guy from a Indian background) and a can of Coca-Cola, not really much to talk about. The service is really bad! I nearly waited 25 minutes to get my order and the servers NEVER refills your glass. Even after you had the oily Spring roll. I had to ask them to refill my water and it even takes them 2 minutes to get to my table and refill my water. They never come around and ask you how is the food and so on.   At the end my bill came up to $14.70. Which i think is a bit over priced from what I had from the food and service. I just left $17.00 and left without ever saying goodbye. Worst customer service experience and overpriced food.  You can get a better deal if you go to other Chinese restaurants!! Save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Garden is a staple after a night of clubbing and or serious drinking. I live right near Bay/Dundas so it's great when I'm fiending some proper asian cuisine within walking/stumbling distance of home.   Hot and Sour soup and Crab Meat Corn are my favourite soups. With the corn soups it is always customary for me to add a splash of soya sauce and 2 splashes of chili oil. You must try it.   I will always order deep fried spicy pepper shrimp, they are so addictive. Once you ordr them once you will order them every time you go. The fried rices are all delicious, BBQ pork is solid and the crispy chili chicken is delicious too.   The décor of the restaurant is welcoming in comparison to your average chinese restaurant downtown. The renovations were definitely worth it, this restaurant is packed late at night on weekends, and for fairly good reason. The food is good. It won't blow you away but it's solid asian grub. No complaints."}
{"text":"Fantabulous lunch spot for excellent Chinese BBQ and good value.  Service is efficient and no-nonsense.  Roast duck is among the top five in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses. The service Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.  Terrible service, food took forever today and they were not even busy. Food arrived cold, toast , eggs potatoes. Waitress stated it was not her, relayed to hostess who did nothing! That is my last visit, Bob Evans and Goodys deserv my business"}
{"text":"Been here about a year ago and food was very good. Came back yesterday and was quite disappointed. We ordered the Satay Beef and Snow Pea Leaves Dish with a boiled rice.  The Snow Pea Leaves in Garlic Sauce dish was well made and tasty but at $12.50 was over price from what we are use to.  The Sizzling Beef in Satay sauce was a major disappointment. It lacked flavour and it had a chunk of Satay not mixed into the dish.  Decor is nice and modern but they are missing many of the details. Experience was pretty much the same as in any Chinese restaurant but with nicer decor and cleaner restaurant.  Would normally give it a two star but had a good experience the first time so average to 3 stars.   Food 3.0/5 Service 3.5/5 Ambiance 4.0/5 Value 3.2/5  =========  Overall 3.32/5"}
{"text":"I will miss this place, and Dominic, who always kept calm even when it was jammed.   Thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have to admit that Garden Restaurant delivers not so much because their food is amazing. As it is not. However it is simple, well done and reliable. I remember their old location and what a dump it was back then, but the food was always tasty.  However once you thrown in the modern and attractive, dark-wood heavy decor, then this place stand above the typical hole in the call that is most Chinese restaurants in the strip/hood.    I would say the restaurant is a relatively cheap and tasty option for when you are in the hood and yes, sometimes you have the feeling that this is not a \"let's stay and linger over a glass of wine,\" kinda of place. No, they are in the business of \"feeding you and once you have done that, please get out and lets get more people in.\" Is that a bad thing? No, I really don't think so, as this place is generally so busy that you yourself will be wanting to leave once you eat.   Now, just remember, this place can get packed... and by packed I mean ridiculously packed. Specially post-club hungry patrons desperately looking for a place to eat.  In fact last time I was there, it was so packed that getting out of the restaurant past the unholy group of people waiting for a table was the hardest thing to do out of the whole visit!  That aside, if you are with a large group of friends and want to eat at a relatively nice looking place with a reliable and competent kitchen, then you can't go wrong with Garden Restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food, dining room updated & spotlessly clean.  Super fast service.      Went with a diverse group for dinner ranging in age from 9 to 69.  I chose this place over some of my personal faves \"deeper\" towards Spadina because of proximity to where we were shopping as well as remembering cleanliness and very good food on a previous visit last fall.    Ordered food at 6:05 and all items were on the table at 6:15.  Very hungry crowd enjoyed the food.     Worthy of mention:  Shanghai Noodles, Shrimp in Black Bean Sauce & the biggest Spring Rolls I've ever had in my life.     Avoid: Curry Chicken.    All in all, I would give this place an A, as it kept everone happy & well fed after a long shopping day in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like sodium and MSG. The prices are great.  If you want a glass of wine that is is a double and under 6 dollars, this is your place. Personally I'm not a fan of Fast Chinese food. Go for the shawarma next door. If u are hungry after midnight."}
{"text":"Dined here for both lunch and dinner a couple of times in the past.   Not the best Chinese restaurant (food is mediocre) but if you want to eat Chinese food with quick service then this is a place to be. I never had to wait more than 5-10 min."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time! I ordered the sweet and sour chicken balls as an appetizer. More dough than chicken. The sweet and sour pork was not bad. I was really disappointed when they didn't accept my Amex or my Visa card. The prices are reasonable but I think you can find a better quality experience somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is an institution in Brook Park, Ohio Suburb of Cleveland. My father and his retired friends come here every Saturday morning to talk, joke and reminisce about the old times. Every time I come into town for a visit, such as Thanksgiving we go to the Garden. This visit is no exception.  The food is excellent, the eggs are great, the hash browns are yummy, the country fried steak with sausage (artery clogging) gravy to die for, really!  The owners are very conscientious and friendly always there to greet you and make sure everything is perfect!  Not my typical place to eat but because of father and family tradition I was able to discover a great little place, that I will always have fond memories of."}
{"text":"First time here as a Yelper. Very good awesome service, sat almost immediately. Server was friendly. The food is so much, that you have to take it home, unless you're my cousins husband then hes still hungry after eating all of his food. Got a Santa Fe burrito, eggs, peepers and onions with chorizo, very tasty. Definite breakfast lunch spot."}
{"text":"Honestly, some of the stuff that we've done here probably would've gotten us kicked out of any other restaurant. I feel bad for the people that work here. The people that roll into this place are always sloshed and loud and messy and basically if I weren't the same, I would not tolerate them.  The food is decent here. Even though it's the middle of the night and I\"m starving and a bit sauced, the food is still mediocre to me. I mean it's probably the best thing that you can get at that time of night but for obvious reasons, I've had better. But it is decent Asian food and it is better than some places that I've been to.  It worries me a bit when you order and as soon as the waiter turns around to leave, your dish is sitting on the table. I like my food fast and all but I'd rather not have it sitting there waiting under the heat lamps. But honestly, can't ask for more at 3am.  Service is extremely friendly and nice, even when some people are being unreasonable and rude. We have our go-to server named Alan, coolest guy ever. Totally remembers us since we frequent this place a bit.   If you're not feeling a hot dog or lining up for 30 minutes for a burrito, go to Garden and you'll be sitting down eating within 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Best general tsao chicken, spring rolls and chicken fried rice in toronto. Please come back!!!!"}
{"text":"When its late night...ur choices are slim..but most pick between hong shing and garden...both are similar...garden has better atmospher as they did renovate the place...they also give you more spicy shrimp LOL..you want to relax come here during the evening around 8pm and see how this place really operates when groups of drunks idiots are not in the place acting the damn fool...spicy shrimp, sizzling beef plate, chicken in black bean sauce, generals tso...proper!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I said i would always come back, and since have brought people to experience the yumm in your tumm of Garden. The usual is General Tao- so frikkin good and like no other I have had. Once i ordered the spicy shrimp thinking it would be totally different, maybe just shrimp douced in some spicy sauce...nope..even better...battered and fried shrimp infused with some special kind of spicy spice, not covered in sauce. They are soooo good. Always get some kind of rice dish (obvi) and the black bean sauce anything is always a winner in my books. They have a very hearty chow mein, saucey and fullll of  meat, seafood and veggies!!  The resaurant itself is very nice! Big large tables for groups and regular tables that are comfortable for 4 people. Its majority black with a really sick drawing of china during some festival waaaaay back in the day (before cars lol) and it just seems so clean and the servers are good too!!  recommended for any time of the day!"}
{"text":"For only living a few minutes away I can't believe I've only been here twice. This is a great nearby family restaurant that shouldn't be overlooked! Just stopped in here for breakfast to-go and when I got home and saw how much food I had to eat I almost feel like I robbed them. $4.99 for the garden special on a weekend? I feel like I should go back and pay them more! Huge, delicious breakfast that I will be getting more often!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm always on the look out for great breakfast spots around the area and this was one of the best.   I ordered the Monterey Omelet - 4 eggs, chorizo sausage, avocado, green peppers onions and Monterey Jack cheese (though I ordered it sans cheese) and hash browns. So much food! And so delicious! I was full about half way through but it was so good that it was hard to stop eating! I did end up taking a little bit home.   Great atmosphere, friendly waitresses. They have wifi too! Prices are very reasonable. You're getting more than your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Okay just a small disclaimer. Every time I've gone to this place, it has been after a big night out partying. (absolutely plowed)  I've been here a few times. The decor is really nice considering it being a Chinese Restaurant. Dark wood, red accents, dark bamboo like wall dividers, plenty of round tables, and a very friendly staff. The staff here are on the ball. Even at 3am they are super fast, very friendly, and have the patience to deal with the inebriated. Food here is pretty much on par with Chinese food in Toronto. If you are from out of town, this place will rock your socks with its Chinese food. Food came fast and service was good. Constant water refills are done stealthily, they are like ninjas with water pitchers, filling up without you knowing. Definitely a good thing when you've had a big night.  Overall, The food is good and the service is patient. Good place to go late night but I'm not sure if I would go during the day as I'm sure I've embarrassed myself enough on the blurry nights. Service and quality is much better than you would get in busy Chinatown at these hours."}
{"text":"It's all about the chili chicken, baby! So good. Fried white meat, topped with chilis and thin fried noodles, over the most incredibly moist, flavorful fried rice (egg & scallion ONLY). Seriously. I want to get my ass over to Toronto RIGHT NOW just to taste the stuff.   The old digs were sketchy, which I liked, because my friends and I could show up and be the only people in there. It was like a private dining room. + the staff would let us smoke cigarettes if it was late enough. Talk about good service!"}
{"text":"This is one of my best restaurants. Open till 5am I assume. Food is really really good. When you visit this place make sure you will try deep fried shrimps, deep fried calamari and deep fried squid. Spicy (when I mean spice it soooo spicy) green beans spicy eaters will be totally surprised. If you decide to go there make sure you check time when its some since its open until late it opens late as well. I drove from Richmond hill today to get my food and while I was driving I already had a taste of food I'm going to order but when I get there around 2:30pm I was shocked, place was closed what a drive so I had to go for a sushi :( good luck yelpers!"}
{"text":"I went to Garden on Friday with a big group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  From reading the reviews it seemed like this was a good place to go with a rowdy group.   We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and some drinks.  They only have one type of red wine which not tasty, a very limited beer selection, and a pretty limited liquor selection as well.  We ordered a variety of dishes to share.  I can't really say I liked any of them.  I realize this is a pretty inexpensive place but even inexpensive Chinese is tasty.    Also, they do not serve desert.    I will say its a good place to go with a group because the food menu is extensive and the food came out really quickly.  Aside from the food coming out quickly though, the service was TERRIBLE.  We waited forever to order, and we literally had to wave our hands to flag over the waiter and we probably sat there for at least 30 minutes after our plates were cleared before anyone came to see if we needed anything or would like the check."}
{"text":"Garden was located right across the street from our Hotel. From the outside the tinted windows made it seem like the place was closed, but if you go close enough you can see people digging in.   The vegetable fried rice and the spicy chicken wings were awesome. It was enough to share for two people. Free hot tea Reasonably priced we got the refreshing oranges after the meal and our fortune cookie Gotta love the hot oil and the soy sauce combination for a kick of flavor."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Large menu. Terrible hot and sour soup.   I'd rather eat at Spadina Gardens down the street, but this place will do late night."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the breakfast here, It makes me want to go back to sleep though. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"The hash browns are inedible and the hostess is very rude."}
{"text":"A small little mom and pops restaurant is what it reminds me of. Food and service is great. My girlfriend and I go there just about every Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Best Chili Chicken ever. Its deep fried lightly yet crispy, with a sweet yet spicy seasoning! Chicken inside is tender and juicy. Its their famous dish and for only $5-$6.  Everyone has to try this place at least once! And that dish as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Garden for the umteenth time with my family after they went to church. I needed to pick up my son because he spent the night with grandma and grandpa. I thought I'd try something different, so I ordered hot chocolate and corned beef hash for $3.99. I figured it would be a side dish at that price and since I wasn't very hungy...But then the waitress asked me, \"How do you want your eggs?\", I was surprised and I thought, \"Oh no! This comes with eggs too?\" Anyway, when my massive plate of food arrived, I immediately tried the hash. It turns out that 1) I've never had hash before, and 2) I don't like hash. I did eat nearly 40% of it though, being a good Samaritan. I polished off my scrambled eggs and hot chocolate, however.   I also started eating my son's pancakes since he wasn't going to be able to finish them alone. I figured he needed help, and more syrup. The food, service, and prices are always good at the Garden."}
{"text":"After several moves over the years, the current location of Garden Restaurant you could almost call it upscale as the decor is modern and clean and a far cry from the old school \"hole in the wall\" chinese BBQ houses of yester-year.  There are often line-ups, but don't let that deter you.  Turnover is very quick, and the staff/kitchen is very efficient.  Just don't mess with the system and slow things down.  This is not the place for a long leisurely linger during prime-time feeding at the trough for all the office dwellers that swarm to it for lunch.  I highly recommend the BBQ Pork, Roasted port and Soya chicken on rice dishes.  The ginger sauce is a must for some extra \"Bam!\"  Try the meats individually or as a combo.  Go crazy with it young grasshopper."}
{"text":"First time eating inside.... Always order breakfast at work and the food great!! Only have gotten breakfast, but the prices here and portions do well for the pockets. Very friendly staff and the atmosphere os calm."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for renovations. Garden Restaurant used to be OK, but kinda gross. Thanks to new digs, nice furniture and cutlery and a classy decor, this place has totally turned around.  It's a huge hot spot for business types during the week -- that huge office building near Chestnut is right across the street, and it's within walking distance of the University Ave. courthouse, which means Garden is a great lunch option for anyone who has ever worked there. The food choices in this area are lacking, to say the least. So many restaurants, but none of them actually any good. But I digress.  Garden is gorgeous inside, they can fit a lot of people in, yet the area is spacious enough that you don't feel squashed. The menu is typical Spadina Chinese food glammed up a bit, and prices are decent. I feel as though you're paying a little for the atmosphere, and I'm OK with doing that as long as the place is as pretty as Garden.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the Yonge/Dundas area. It's a short walk down the street and while the food is at par with Spadina Garden at Bay, the atmosphere is way nicer which makes for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"We have been the dining at the Garden periodically for 15 years at least. The service is always friendly and our food delicious . the price is unbeatable and very affordable. We usually go in for breakfast and everything comes out fast, hot and as ordered.   The ambiance of The Garden is hardly a factor. It hasn't been updated in many years and is full of dated hard wood and cracked vinyl seats. It's typically clean.  We don't eat dinner there, because the menu is generally home cooked classic food and we haven't enjoyed the meals. The breakfast is wonderful and dad's favorite place for an omelet.  However on our most recent visit to the garden we were very dissatisfied with the hostess who was visibly ill. She was coughing and hacking into her hand as she walked around the restaurant. She handled menus, methods of payment, walked into the kitchen coughing and performing various other duties while obviously under the weather. We heard several patrons comment about her health and that she should have stayed home.   I myself made a comment to her when we were cashing out and her only comment was that she was sorry. I feel that by putting all of your diners and the public at risk of getting sick was a very irresponsible choice.  Regardless of how good the food is I will probably not be in  for a while until I know that the employees are healthy enough to serve the public. I didn't even want to finish my breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the food is standard Chinatown Cantonese fare. Not spectacular but a good option so close to the bus terminal. My one criticism is the service. The waiters have consistently tried to talk me out of my orders offering more standard options. I assume there have been people who've complained if they've expected Canadian chinese and recieved actual Chinese food instead and the servers are being proactive BUT I find having to work hard convince my server that I really DO want what I've asked for quite irritating.   All in all, this place has good food, looks clean and spacious but lacks the charm of the places on Dundas closer to Spadina."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK.   The hot and sour soup was large and in charge and all of the food came quickly. It's a really typical greasy Chinese menu, but the decor is a little nicer than most places around here. Tackier? Nicer. Nicer and tackier.   PEPPER'S PISSED: No debit and you have to pay at the front. This was not clearly articulated and I was waving like a fool.    17/30  PS: Cornucopia."}
{"text":"I was unable to make myself like the Garden after two or three visits. The only funny thing I really remember of it is that first time in I've asked for a bottle of Tsingtao beer, the water was like: \"It is not just some beer, it is THE beer!\" And I was like: \"ok, bring me THE beer, please\".  Steam rice was well prepared and comfortable to grab with chopsticks. But the food was bad... Not really horrible, just not user-friendly at all - and barely digestible. I tried different plates and they were all like that. Uninspiring taste and sore stomach guarantee.  Obviously compared to the actual Chinatown places just a couple of blocks to the West, Garden may feel like a luxury spot, but still... Can not recommend it, and would not return - unless forced or drunk."}
