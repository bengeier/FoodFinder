{"text":"We went for the 1st time last week, the menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes. We had the masala dosa, harriyali and sukka, they were all exquisite. All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of homemade food. We had an pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavors. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Just been there for the Sunday lunch buffet felt there are no much options to explore and the taste is really bad 
Fully disappointed with many of the dishes like coconut chutney is raw, poori has not been fried well and gulab jam is so hard it was hard to cut and eat.
Advice people to think before going"}
{"text":"Absolutely loving it, and I haven't even tried the buffet yet. The service is the best part, helpful with things I didn't understand and beyond friendly to help with specials and combos. I've been three times in three days and expect to continue that streak. My gf agrees it's awesome, we will be regulars here."}
{"text":"Excellent food !!! Buffet is pretty good with great number of items (both Veg n Non Veg). One of the house specials -  Mirapa Kodi is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great buffet dinner, varieties of dosa, best in town till date, even panner curry so authentic and smokey taste. Spice level is upon your taste. Going visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Thursday Dosa Night - Please improve on the cutlery you have.The bowls are pathetic and so are the dishes. I was disgusted with the dirty old bowls even before trying the food....Ordered all kinds of dosas on menu...Only Masala Dosa was good..Everything else did not taste great..You should add uttappams in the menu instead of the existing onion dosa which is a joke,just some onion placed in a plain dosa!! Idlys were hard ,but vada was good.You can do better Amaravati !!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent on a recent visit!  It was a marked improvement over my initial visit a week prior.  I believe the new management is working hard to turn out a good product.  The lunch buffet was excellent...I recommend giving this establishment a chance.  

REVISION:  This restaurant has transitioned from 5 stars to 1 Star...all of which occurred from new ownership.  I give this place two thumbs down...I only wish I had more thumbs.  This could be your restaurant if:

1.  You enjoy poor customer service.  They can't even manage to bring naan to the table during the meal.  I had to request it on more than one occasion...they finally bring me some while working on my second plate.  The staff is unfriendly and can never crack a smile.

2.  You enjoy mediocre to poor food.  I don't believe anything else needs to be said here.

3.  You enjoy overpriced food.

Granted these are merely my opinions...but these are the opinions of someone who has visited this restaurant regularly over the three past ownerships.  Obviously these are all problems that can be fixed and I certainly hope they do so."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and were looking for Indian. Went for dinner and had the chicken masala and the chicken korma.  We had a few breads too. We loved everything but the cheese naan and the lentil soup were not favorites."}
{"text":"There is no reason why this place should earn less than 5 stars. 

Ordered - 
Vegetable Manchurian : ordered medium spice level, yet it was lil over than medium. Obviously you should expect this at an Indian restaurant. Tasted delicious and quantity is great.
Paneer Biryani : huge quantity and go with an empty stomach to binge on this. Really delicious raita and salan.

Just coz I said food was lil spicier, I got a free Mango Lassi..lol 
Waiter was kind enough to check status on my table, asked if I had any music preferences, service was lil slow but taste over takes them all. 
Should prolly visit this place soon for their south Indian delicacies."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been to many Indian places in the valley, but this one is by far the best lunch buffet! A great variety of different dishes that everyone will like! I highly recommend going here hungry because you will be leaving in a food coma! Coming back again soon and making sure to let everyone I know about it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet.  A limited selection much like most Indian buffets, but what you get is great.  I enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Ordered on Postmates and we were so surprised by how excellent the food was, the rice was perfect and the lamb was to die for, Postmates ran late but it didn't affect the food like we thought it would. Haven't been there in person yet but we will soon enough."}
{"text":"The food here was more authentic and the taste was not overpowering. Definitely good value food, and the service was spectacular. Would recommend to those fond of South Indian cuisine that is not greasy and oily."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Indian restaurants I've ever been to.  I used to come here and the food was good but I had heard they changed ownership and it is terrible.  I don't usually review restaurants but I am on this one.  The food was bland and old tasting.  The Kheer was watered down, didn't even taste any coconut and had no flavor.  How does that happen!  Every dish that I had was terrible.  The owners need to give up the restaurant business!  If you can mess up an Indian buffet, I cannot imagine how bad their dinner menu is.  It really deserves a 0 rating!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time after management change from kabab palace to amravathi and was hoping the food taste would be same but greatly disappointed. I was a regular weekend gueat there for Goat masala curries and chicken curries which were made so much better with previous management and cook...but the new one is very very bad...they made masala curries with sour taste(who does that)...again very disappointed and possibly not going back to amravathi"}
{"text":"After a long time found a amazing Indian restaurant, hands down one of the BEST in the valley!!


Keep it up and all the Best"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food and above and beyond service. This Sunday the chef made an out of this world chicken dish (Mirapa Kodi) I've never seen thus dish at any other Indian restaurant. The food here is fresh, hot and delicious. We drive by 3 other Indian food restaurants to eat here!"}
{"text":"given they opened recently (2 months) , they are still under transition and figuring out phase.. so most of the menu options is still not available.The food was not tasty and quantity was much less compared to any other restaurants.will never go back again."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. Friendly staff. I was there for Buffet with my family. Being a vegetarian, unfortunately not too many choices. Especially we went there around 1:30pm and they ran out of some vegetarian dishes. I asked the staff and he mentioned it's because it's over crowded. But didn't even bother to refill. They ran out of pani puri, chaat etc. Also they just had one desert. And we were provided dosas by the time we are almost done with our buffet. But, the staff and owner are friendly. I didn't had a great experience may be because it's crowded."}
{"text":"My husband and his best friend went for dinner. We read the reviews thinking maybe we'll just give it a try anyways since it is under new management. The other reviews were right about the service being slow, especially after they received their dinner my husband order two dishes to go. It took over an hour! The dinner to go was dry and not as delicious as I've ordered it many times at other restaurant"}
{"text":"I've only been to the lunch buffet so far, but each time has been delightful. I love the rice patty things and the butter chicken. I would prefer a lamb option to the goat, but everything else is great! And the staff cares. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Their Dosas and Biryanis are too good that I keep ordering from the same restaurant multiple times a week. I never had a bad experience so far and they maintain the quality as it was the first time. I would highly recommend this place and especially the Thursday dosa buffet with so many varieties. Tooo good"}
{"text":"We have finally found an Indian food restaurant in the Phoenix area that is amazing. The staff was super nice, the chef made us something off the menu that was ridiculously delish. Can't wait to go back!"}
