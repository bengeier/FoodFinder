{"text":"We decided to make a return visit to Whitlock's after a relatively disappointing experience earlier this year. Sad to say, this visit has permanently moved this restaurant to the \"do not visit ever again\" category. What a complete disappointment, through and through.  We were seated quickly enough, but it took some time for our waitress to check in and take our drink order. When she came, she couldn't remember the three drinks we ordered, and had to repeat them back to us. She got one of them wrong. This was just the beginning of the poor service.  She came back quite some time later to take our food order, and again, repeating everything back to us, making mistakes, and us correcting her. I ordered a side house salad. She brought a side caesar instead, even after confirming back to me.   I ordered the pad thai. What an awful dish. Over-sauced, over-sweet, and over-done chicken and shrimp. My wife had the salmon. It was over-broiled and under-flavoured. My daughter had chicken on a bun, which was also over-cooked. My youngest daughter had the chicken nuggets and fries, which was the best meal served at our table.  Disappointing service, disappointing food, and a sad atmosphere made for a less than enjoyable night out. Wish I could ask for my money back."}
{"text":"I recently went with locks to order a fettucine Alfredo with my aunt her food was OK but they messed my order up it said that the fettucine Alfredo contain no onions but when it got to me I found onions in it and that was horrible now I personally hate onions so I sent it back when the manager came and her that I was sending it back he yells at the cook saying that he was supposed to put no onions in it so they bring me another one and it still has onions so we end up leaving and going to Popeyes I don't know if I've ever had a worse experience thanks Whitlock's"}
{"text":"whitlock's restaurant, they should be ashamed for holding title of this name. I just got back from dinner and can not believe what I just ate. Any food that involved preparation was NOT done as it should of been it was absolutely disgusting and I do NOT RECOMMEND eating here."}
{"text":"I had been to Whitlocks before for brunch but not in the past two years. I looked it up on Yelp to get the number and noticed it didn't rate well. My previous experience said to go for the brunch anyway as it is in the neighborhood.  I used to recommend this restaurant but can no longer give it my stamp of approval. There wasn't any big problem but a series of things that left us disappointed. Dirty dishes and glasses, lack of knowledge on ingredients (allergies), dishes not cleared, no coffee refills offered. Food is ok (no bacon!). My 2-star rating is in part due to the disappointment that brunch used to be very good."}
{"text":"One would think that of all the dishes on the menu, Whitlock's would at least have \"Whitlock's Pasta\" down. After all, it only has a few ingredients - penne, mushrooms, snow peas, chicken, and basil cream sauce. Unfortunately, however, I received penne and chicken drenched in very bland cream and mystery melted cheese with barely a hint of pesto, no mushrooms, a couple of snow peas, a ridiculous quantity of onions, and a sprinkling of what appeared to be dill. I was not feeling particularly argumentative, so I didn't send the dish back despite the undeclared ingredients, but did mention it to the waiter at the end when he picked up my half eaten plate. He promised to mention it to the kitchen, but didn't offer any apologies. Other dishes were just okay. The calamari was typical greasy frozen rings. My husband's Pad Thai wasn't bad, but very very spicy. The patio was quite pleasant. All considered, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience. The food was decent.. But the service was bad and the staff were not helpful towards the situation that occurred during the night. Which made the overall experience very unpleasant. I was with a few friends and we were rushed off the patio at 11 pm because the patio was being shut down. So we moved inside. When we moved, I realized that I had left my new iphone4 outside, when I went to look for it.. it was gone. When I called it about 5 minutes later.. it was already off! We were the last ones on the patio so there was no way a customer could have taken it. ..Still no sign from the restaurant about my phone. It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration and had such a lovely time.  The food was so delicious and the service was warm, attentive, and professional. Thank you Whitlock's staff for a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"This place counts on its location, patio and prices to attract customers. But the food is very bad, just industrial products badly assembled and cooked. The service seems disorganized and slow. Come here for the beer, enjoy the patio, sure, but I wouldn't touch the food with a stick."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I am a regular at green eggplant and wanted to try a new place. There was no line up however, I was asked to wait as they prepared our table for 20 minutes. The table is blocked with 2 other tables so everyone you get up or even move you have to say excuse me. The server was extremely rude. Forget about being greeted just for asking to options of bread, she laughed at me. The food is alright. I had burger. Nothing special. Would not recommend this place to anyone, let alone be back. To like this place you have to have a taste for rude behavior, slow service, and sarcasm. One of the worse places I have ever been."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that this is a review for lunch / dinner.  I have done the breakfast buffet on Sunday and it is fine.  Expensive but the food is decent.  I cannot say the same for the standard menu.  I have been a few times ( it is 2 mins from my house) and it perfectly captures everything that is wrong with eating in the Beaches.  They are usually pretty busy so I guess they don't have to try hard.  Everything that I have had is just blah.  It's not terrible but it is absolutely forgettable.  The staff are also just not all that good.  They really show very little interest in food at all.  Inside has nice decor and the patio is okay as long as the wasps aren't too bad.  I really wish the Beaches could produce just one or two fresher places like what you find a few minutes down the road in Leslieville.  Anyway, I am working from home today and now need to find something to eat.  It is a serious indictment of my neighborhood that I find much better options up in the suburbs where I work!  At least we have nice parks and the Beach!"}
{"text":"Had lunch for 2 - spent $50 and it felt worth $10.  The fries are garbage and the food was mediocre at best.  Service was pleasant - so no problems there - but definitely did not get value for the money.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"A definite new low.  We booked a babysitter and descended on what used to be a one of our places to hit nearby for brunch. When we got there I was surprised by 2 things: it was the \"grand new opening\" of new owners and the place was just about empty.  We soon found out why.  The potatoe salad had grown a skin and when scooped up, revealed a paler white colour (I decided against it).  The bread was all precut and hard as a rock.  The butter was placed on the fireplace (and liquid).  The one lonely egg benny left had a yellow goo on it, dried and separated (and never refilled), the sausage cold, overdone and rubbery.  There were mussels, that looked like raisins.  The tomato sauce was so cooled down and it looked like a sticky jam.  The potatoes (although cold) were tasty.  Brings me to the staff...  When I overheard patrons (regulars, knowing the prior owner by name) inquire about the new owners, they replied \"some guys\" had bought it.  They were short, unmotivated and incredibly rude. I was clearly not eating the buffet and turned to the hot station for an omelette and some pancakes.  The cook in charge of the waffles, poured the batter from a white square bucket, with dried drippings all around it - it was so gross looking that I passed.  The omelette withstood the taste test.  While eating I saw staff pour left over syrup back into the can used to serve the pancake station. Fancy grand opening this was!  I won't be back - ever again - and not one person sitting in that restaurant today will."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service atrocious.  Waitress didn't know the menu.  No bartender (on a Friday night?!) means no cocktails.  Not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Whitlocks many times over the years and generally the service and food were fantastic. I wanted my boyfriend to try it and it's so cozy in there with the fireplace so we gave it a shot. We arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday night. There were 2 tables of two including us and a party at the back (around 8-10ppl). There was one server who was working her butt off and a manager (I am guessing) that was COMPLETELY USELESS. We watched him watch the waitress do all the work as we waited 25 minutes for our drinks. It was an hour+ before our order was taken for our entree.  My questions are: 1. where is the old wait staff who were awesome? 2. why is there one server on a wednesday night? 3. why are you a restaurant manager if you can't help in a restaurant??  4. why did it take 2 people almost 3 hours to eat dinner?  I will not be returning. I will also be telling my family and friends who visit not to return! I was embarrassed for making the recommendation. This place now SUCKS."}
{"text":"Im shocked this place is even in business. The food is beyond pathetic. The only fresh items are the omelette which was half decent and the waffles which tasted like they used left over dosa batter that they couldnt use else where. The eggs benedict was literally a boiled egg on an english muffin and the calamari was cold and hard. This place was a huge let down and I would never go back. The servers were also rude and slow."}
{"text":"I'm here. Its 9:30 am. The restaurant is open yet the only thing currently ready at the breakfast buffet is rice... this is awkward. Why are they open if the buffet isnt prepared? It is now 10 am. Many buffet items are now prepared but several trays contain only steam. The staff are pleasant but they are tragically under staffed and if you want a waffle or omelette you have to search the place to find the chef. I have also discovered that once you have said waffle you are expected to go out to the sidewalk to dress it. They do have REAL whipped cream though. It is now almost 10:30. The entire buffet seems to be prepared now. The eggs benny are good but a bit too vinegary. The \"tiramisu\" is waaaaayyyy sugary. Can't eat it. The experience hasn't been as terrible as some reviewers claim but it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This may be my worst restaurant experience ever. Unfortunately I can't give less that one star, otherwise I would have.   Went for a Sunday brunch buffet.   Food: cold and over cooked. Eggs Benedict were over cooked. Literally a boiled egg on top of a muffin. Everything else was quite average tasting but still cold. They somehow managed to serve coffee that was cold as well. Bread basket was empty the whole time. Rice and calamari in brunch was cold as well with a horrible taste of too much sodium. Couldn't eat more than the first spoon.    Service: servers were rude. When asked why egg Benedict is like a boiled egg, she rudely replied saying it's a brunch and it's been lying on a hot plate since morning, hence that fully cooked it. Wow. It was still cold.  Omelette bar was facing the side walk. We literally had to exit the restaurant with our plates and go around the side walk to place order for the omelette. The guy was standing at a corner inside the restaurant with one of the side walls retracted facing the sidewalk. Wow. Never experience this before and hoping not to ever again."}
{"text":"Food was okay but it too way too long.   Also passed me off that they force you to pay 15% tip on terrible service.   Tip is also calculated after taxes so end up paying 20%"}
{"text":"One Star is too generous!! What a waste of space! We returned here after 5 years and wish we had not! My husband got sick after two bites of the burger and my child's nuggets were in fact chicken sausage!!! My advice is STAY AWAY!!! If you go, expect these:  1) Dirty restaurant, filthy tables and cutleries  2) Terrible and unsanitary food 3) warm beer  4) grumpy and rude servers  Close it down and make room for someone to open a decent place please!"}
{"text":"Whitlocks certainly has a following, and I think it probably does provide a good Sunday brunch.  However, my experience with my daughter and her family, looking for an early dinner on a Thursday, was a bit of a disaster.  My grandson had a birthday and this was just the family. When I got there they had ordered, and as it was a hot day, and it was early, I decided to wait and see what their food looked like.  Everything was awful, sorry. Even the spring rolls were greasy. My daughter had ordered the blackened trout, which was dried out, served with with bok choy, wilted and lacking flavour. The portobello veggie burger, served on a cold white bun, with sad looking greens, fell apart when my grand-daughter attempted to eat it. Both children ate little but the fries.  At around $20.00 for a main course, I think one could expect something a little better. Perhaps 5:30 is too early for the kitchen, and they are geared for a later crowd.Their problem, not our's.  I agree with Will A. The Beaches have never had good restaurants. They seem to specialize in 'Brunch'. which works well, given the location.  Again I agree, Leslieville, has some of the best rated restaurants in the east end.  On the plus side, when my daughter complained, they deducted the price of one of the entrees. The wine was fine...But still..not a good experience"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant if you're looking for decent specials at a fair price. Depending on what day of the week it is, you can get a tasty spaghetti special ... they also have a very punchy vinaigrette dressing for their house salad. I didn't find the food bland, but service is tedious even on a slow night. Pack your patience. I haven't had their breakfast buffet, but I've seen lineups outside the restaurant. Ambiance is dark and there's a bit of a smell emanating from the kitchen or basement? It can be unpleasant when you're dining."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch buffet is just an annoyance. Too much traffic for the hot food and a very poor selection. It's crammed into one small corner of the room.  The salads and desserts, that have the attention of one or two guests, take up half the restaurant.  You have to go onto the street and almost beg for an omelette, roast beef, or a waffle and wait to be served by one surly cook. There were about 8 people standing on the sidewalk with plates in our hands. Horribly embarrassing!!   On the plus side, what I did eat was decent: One eggs Benedict, one sausage, and one waffle with blueberries and whipped cream. Ridiculous for $15! but I guess that's what you have to expect in the beach."}
{"text":"One should NEVER mistake avocado for roast beef.  After years of hearing about how amazing Whitlock's was, I took two friends from out-of-town here for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. I ordered the club sandwich and was a little surprised to see a slice of roast beef tucked in amongst the chicken, bacon and tomato.  Horrified, I realized it was greyish-brown avocado. There was no way in hell this was sliced any time in the previous 12 hours, but I was a little hungover and just couldnt be bothered to send it back. I should have, as the sandwich got worse from there: the ciabatta bun was doughy, the chicken cold, the bacon HARD and cold. The only redeeming feature of this meal was the chipotle mayonaise which was actually quite delicious.  I really shouldnt have paid a cent for it, but again, I just didnt want the hassle. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service, if you want to see the team o servers fighting between each other this is the perfect place! I should have left the place as soon as the server was rude to answer my question! Don't go to this place! I'll never go back and don't recommend at all!"}
{"text":"Weekend brunch is delicious and affordable. Recent change in management is good. Still some favourite classics and new items with a twist. I recently had the risotto and I loved it. The owner also brought us free butternut squash with carrot to try and it was amazing. Looking forward to going back soon. A classic in the Beaches."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend went here for our anniversary off a suggestion from my mom. We had been here before with her and my grandmother for dinner and it had been pretty good This time however the result was pretty different.  We went on a Thursday evening and the place was practically empty, only other couples were eating. They told us to sit wherever we wanted so by the window it was. I ordered the crabcake app. the crabcake was mushy for me, my boyfriend liked them though so he ate the rest.  My boyfriend got the salmon pasta and I got the gnocchi. Mine was just blahhhhh, my boyfriend didn't even finish his.  The worst thing though was that the waitress we had creeped the hell out of us, she walked at you with big bug eyes and her head cocked. Needless to say we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We moved to the Beach a couple of years ago and we'd often pass this restaurant while walking on Queen St. It has a great patio and always seems busy so we were excited to finally try it this past Mother's Day for brunch.   What a total disappointment! First of all, they weren't making lattes or cappuccinos even though they had an espresso machine. Second, no chocolate milk for the kids. That's how brunch began and it went downhill from there.  The omelette station was okay however they had the oddest non-brunch-like items at the buffet - like cooked peas and fish. And not smoked fish, like dinner style fish. It seemed like they just carted out the buffet from the night before. The eggs benedict were dry too. The dessert station had a couple of Sara Lee cakes and some jello. Pitiful. The only thing that was good was our server. The buffet didn't have bacon (who doesn't have bacon?) so she brought my son some from the kitchen.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Came in to this spot to have lunch before heading out to the beach, the waitress sat us down on the patio at a dirty table, it had something spilled all over it... so I gave her the benifit of a doubt thought she would come back and wipe it down, well she comes back about 10min later with menus and puts them down right on the nasty wet table, and just walks away. That was all I needed, didn't even bother eating here so can't say anything about their  food, but I'm sure when the staff can sit customers at a funky table the rest of the place is just as dirty... we wound up going next door  and had great meal.  Skip this place and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Day at the beach had me build up an appetite! Decided to head to Whitlock's after reviewing the menu looked promising both budget friendly and extensive options. Friend and I ordered a burger splitting a side of fries and salad. Greek salad was large with lots of great flavour (feta, olives, tomatoes) classic fixinings.  The burger on the other hand was over cooked and got drier after each bite. Let's just say chocking hazard.   This place was promising with good service and large patio- skip this one as there's tons of options on the strip."}
{"text":"Had a really decent breakfast here..price was typical. On my list of places to go for breakfast if I'm in the beaches in the morning."}
{"text":"There's so much potential for me to give this restaurant a 5-star rating, particularly its brunch, however, I just can't. Why not, you ask?  The food is lovely and tasty. And there's such a great selection. So, my disgruntlement comes from the food being so cold (I'm talking about the hot stuff) when served. Take the prime rib. It's a beautiful piece of meat, but it's tepid and not very tasty with rhe sauce. Idem with the Eggs Benedict.  The lovely omelettes and waffles are delicious, but everything that goes in the hot serving dishes just doesn't maintain the heat and great flavour of the food by the time it reaches your mouth. Still, great value for quality food. If only..."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was in the early 90's, and it's still a great place.  The food is really good, especially at Brunch.  Dinner's a good choice too, never been there at lunch.  Also, the staff is attentive, but not pushy.  The've got a nice patio for the summer too..."}
{"text":"The other reviews here seem to say that this place is okay for brunch, but terrible for main meals. We went here for supper on a Friday evening and guess what? Yup, it was poor.  The crab cakes were all right, but nothing special. The panko-crusted chicken was fine, but a tad overwhelmed by the sun-dried tomatoes. The bruschetta was, as noted here by another reviewer, oddly served with tomato on the side of the garlic bread, instead of atop.  But most annoying to me was the disappointment x 3 in the jambalya. First off, within a few bites, I bit into a small black stone. It was probably in the rice (I hope), but I set it on the side of the plate and didn't want to make a big deal of it. Then I bit into a bone in my supposedly boneless chicken. Again, I set it aside, and didn't say anything--it happens. But what was most disturbing was the taste of the sausages in this dish. It had the off taste of meat that has gone past its expiry date. I tried a second piece, thinking that maybe the first was a fluke. Nope. Then--did I dare--a third? Same thing. I let my partner try, and he agreed. So we set the rest of the pieces on the side of the plate. My regret is that I soldiered on, instead of just saying to waitress at the second bite of sausage that I thought it had gone bad.  When I did tell her as she cleared the plates, she did apologize, and said that she'd tell the chef. But when I went to pay, about 20 minutes later, no one said a thing. Usually, in most restaurants (and I say this because I used to work in one, and we took customers' feedback seriously), if I tell them that I thought the food had gone bad, they'd go and check the rest of the supply, and let us know. But they said neither \"Yes, it had gone bad\", or \"No, you were wrong.\" Just silence as I paid.  So the various things found in my food, the bad food itself, and the silence about the potentially harmful meat, all assured that I would never go back to this place, and make sure I tell friends about my experience."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  That's about it.  I had the one vegetarian dish on the menu.  Pre-frozen ravioli in canned sauce.  Yuck.  Manager was nice enough to take it off the bill, so that was a plus.  But even with that we won't be back.  Sorry Whitlocks, there are much better restaurants in the beaches."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there's so much sass about this place on here. I've always has nice service and a great experience. And always in the cases where something was \"off\" we were always  compensated in some way. I know it's an old restAurant it's been around the neighbourhood foreeeeever it feels like so there definitely doing something right! They do need  to up their game a bit brunch wize bc there so much competition in the area for brunch spots. What sets them apart is there nice patio... Price wize it's a little steep for brunch bit it's ayce style so you get  your bang for your buck  depending on your appetite so my advice is to go w an empty stomach and big appetite!"}
{"text":"Went to Whitlock's for a late brunch on a Saturday morning. Our table of 4 was seated right away. There were 3 other tables with customers, some of which were just finishing up their meals.  Coffee/teas and waters were brought over quickly. We ordered 2 classic breakfasts, one breakfast burrito, and one breakfast skillet.  It took so long for us to get our meals, that we were wondering if they were harvesting the wheat for our toast?!  When the food arrived, my toast and eggs were cold, alongside my soggy bacon. How disappointing. We finished what we could; however, getting our bill took a long time as well.  It seemed confusing to me....only 4 other tables inside the restaurant; however, time management from the server was really lacking.  Although the complimentary banana bread was tasty and a nice touch, I'm not sure I would return to Whitlock's. How could good service for a full restaurant or delicious food during a buffet actually exist here?"}
{"text":"Such an amazing location gone to waste mostly by the poor quality food and the inconsistent service. I've been here three times now and can say that the observations from the first visit proved to be a fact. What you'll find here is an amazing location and decent setup. There are some nice small booths, tables by the windows and a decent sized patio. The staff is a a hit and miss, but unfortunately it's mostly on the bad side. Food portion is ok and menu price is average, on par with other restaurants in the neighbourhood, but definitely lower in quality and taste. Some might say that the price for the all you can eat brunch buffet is an awesome deal, but is a decent price worth bland testing food? Seeing all the reviews for this place from the past and realizing that things don't seem to have gotten any better make me believe that it's simply a matter of time before this place shuts its doors."}
{"text":"You had class. You coulda been a contender, but you f'd up the order.  Finding ourselves in knee-deep in renos ad without a kitchen on Christmas, we headed out (with our tails between our legs) to Queen E for what we thought we be a crappy meal at Gabby's of all places. Part of my soul is dying again at that thought.  Fortunately, it was closed and Whitlocks was open with a fixed price menu and available tables, so were relieved to say the least.   The menu looked great and the lone server was friendly and apologetic for what I thought was a decent-paced service. Unfortunately, though tasty my steak arrived medium-well (ordered rare) and my s/o's lamb arrived v-e-r-y rare (ordered medium). Sadly, the food was still tasty, so if it had been prepared to order, it would've been excellent.  Despite the disappointment, Whitlock's has a good-looking menu with a mish-mash of worldly influences, so I'm putting them on my second-chance list."}
{"text":"A caricature of the typical Beach restaurant, cementing the neighbourhood's reputation for incredibly bland, boring, blasé food.  Came here by accident, really, drawn in by the nice patio. And, umm, that's the only good thing I can say about it.   Burgers were overcooked and boring, served on an undesirable and somewhat stale bun. Veggie burgers were a bit less boring, but still boring and still not good. Crab cakes were a far more noteworthy but only because they were a frickin' train wreck of flavourless pulp!  Yeesh - I may have nightmares about them!  Prices were very low for a restaurant with such a nice setting and patio, but still not worth the price."}
{"text":"ok I guess summer started in my books since I'm starting to go out for brunches on sundays (never happens in winter)  last sunday was my 2nd time in Whitlock's. and 2nd time having brunch here since last summer.  Some of my friends are just crazy about the brunch in this place. And yes I agree the price for the all-you-can-eat (and all you can drink juice bar) brunch buffet is pretty neat ($14) but it's not targeted to vegetarians/vegans.   There are loads and loads of different salads but the hot menu consists mainly of meat and sausages. which is a bit disappointing. From the hot menu I could only have baked potatos, omelet and florentines(ok so it's totally not good for vegans). I'd love to see there some roasted veggies and mushrooms.  the sweet menu is huuuuge - pancakes, waffles, strawberry crumbles, jello, mousse, heaps of fruits. YUM!  the cook/server/greeter - is a super friendly guy and a soul of this place. he was everywhere all the time, chatting with people, calling regular customers by their names and smiling to everyone=)   oh and they have a nice patio outside for the real summer days.  My rating is 3+ (more than just ok but less than being a fan of this place)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly slow service in a half empty restaurant. Waited almost half an hour for a burger. Also saw that customers beside us weren't happy. They did not get offered a special by their waitresses that we got. When challenged she replied \"I thought you read the menu\". They also got a small dish of mayo on the side that had begun to grow a skin on top, probably from being uncovered too long, let's hope in the fridge. The food once it arrived was decent but nothing special. You'll be drawn to their patio on a nice summer day, which will probably have room on it. There's a reason for that. Don't waste your time here. I don't know if it has a patio, but The Green Eggplant across the street is a much much better choice."}
{"text":"Took my parents to brunch this past weekend. This review is based only on their Sunday Brunch, as I have not gone there for anything else.  I \"liked\" Whitlock's but each time I go for brunch, it seems to get worse every time.  What's stable is the dishes are always dirty...my wife complains about this and when I checked, it took a bit to fine a clean plate/cup. Service was a hit or miss. They greeted you but when I needed a refill on their tiny cup of coffee, I could have gotten it myself faster. And the waffles were burnt (put enough whipped cream on them and my kids would eat anything).  The roast beef was good - not dry, cooked well for my kids to eat. And the price is decent for a buffet - I think it's $15 for adults and 7 or 8 for kids.  Will I go again? If my 6 year old bugs me enough but probably not."}
{"text":"All I can say is big show, no results. I've been here for their brunch and happy hour snacks, which you would think they can't screw up. Well, let me tell you that it is actually kinda gross. The brunch buffet is awkward, messy and really nothing special other than gut fill. Happy hour apps were all deep fried from frozen and really greasy. As much as I want to like this place for its location and (potential for great) atmosphere, it misses the mark in a big way."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. The staff did not acknowledge us for a good 10 minutes while we were waiting at the door. On top of that, once we were seated, our server didn't bother taking our orders or giving us cutlery until we had asked 3 times. The food was great but because of the craptastic service I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Arrived around 6 pm Nov 26. One server. Salmon was gross - overcooked and smothered in cream and overdosed with Dill, dill dill. Caesar salad was also smothered in dressing. Seems all the items on the menu are cream sauces - everything fattening. Salad was limp and tasteless. Service spotty.  Worst thing was - the white wine was definitely watered down. I asked for a different white wine and it was even more watered down - the waitress(owner?) was definitelty adding water to the $10 glass of white - she feigned shock when I mentioned it - will never go back - try the Green Eggplant nearby - great food, prices and warm service."}
{"text":"It is 6:15 pm on a Sunday night .. I got here At 4:50 thinking I would beat the rush .. dining by myself .. the staff was quick to refill my water .. got 3 glasses .. enjoyed my Caesar salad  and mussels .. waited 15 minutes .. was handed my bill with no question as to whether I wanted coffee or dessert .. not happy with service . I could understand if they were busy .. but they were not & had 2 waitresses !   I complained when someone finally came .. I ordered desert and coffee .. the dessert was explained to be on the house .."}
{"text":"The only way this could have been more of a disappointment is if we left hungry. We booked well ahead for Christmas dinner and were looking forward to a festive treat. Upon arrival, the restaurant only had a few tables occupied, yet the one we had reserved was not available. We weren't seated promptly but left awkwardly at the door. We had to ask for our drinks, because the server didn't bring them to the table. The meal arrived cold, tasteless and very disappointingly, with no stuffing. We weren't offered additional beverages or coffee/tea with dessert. We overheard our waiter saying he wanted to get out of there. The time together for my daughter and I was more important than the meal, but there was almost no effort to make this a good experience so we didn't leave a tip. This restaurant has been a favourite for nearly 20 years, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. My husband and I frequented this place every year for the Jazz Festival. Last year we didn't go and this time we were in the neighborhood and decided to eat there. The only thing tasty was their brie appetizer. I ordered a salad and it was just about the worse salad I've had in a very long time. The avocado was so nasty. Not sure why, but it was. normally you can't go wrong with salads, but in this case it was just really bad. My husband ordered the special which was a baked fish. We had to add a lot of salt to both dishes just to get some flavor in there. I use to love this place.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I had a good time here. Good atmosphere and good food. I had the duck risotto. It was really good. The only issue I had was that it was freezing in there. I did happen to go new years eve and it was one of coldest days on record. They really only the fireplace to heat the place. But besides that it was good."}
{"text":"Ok, so i don't like writing negative reviews but here we go: Went Sunday for a birthday brunch about 12 people with kids, food is decent, the omelette guy is always pleasant and you can tell by his food he enjoys his job.  Fruit was fresh.  Waitstaff is a complete negative experience: took forever to get coffee, they brought 1 spoon with 4 coffees, i guess we re suppose to share, staff never checked up on us, we had to walk over and ask every time we wanted something, the place is inexpensive so i guess your getting what you pay for, decent food and lousy service."}
{"text":"We strolled into this restaurant after a nice afternoon swim. Strategic corner location, it is hard to miss.   My friend ordered the pad Thai and she was not impressed. The noodles were starchy and the spice level could have been kicked an extra notch as she requested. But my dish was great! I ordered the blackened trout, a result of using a Cajun spiced rub. The trout was delicious! The broccoli and cauliflower were steamed and very crunchy. The only downside was the rice which was a bit dry.  We sat in the patio, which due to its eastern location was shady. Very refreshing. We stayed for a long time without anyone rushing us. I would return and try other dishes."}
{"text":"We were at Whitlock's on June 4 th for a small Birthday celebration.  About 2 PM.   We sat on their patio watching the people go by on Queen St.  Staff greetings were prompt an cheerful. FOOD: We decided to order multiple appetizers for sharing rather than main courses. We had the baked Brie, fish tortillas, fried calamari, and crab cakes and a shrimp salad.  AMAZING!!  We couldn't believe how wonderful EVERY dish was!!!!  We had last been here last summer.  I was told that is are new owners now. It was good before.... But it's GREAT NOW!!   Go and enjoy!!!!! ,"}
{"text":"I got there on a Wednesday for lunch and decided to sit on the patio. There was only one waitress and she was stressed initially but after I asked her if she was having a rough day she vented a bit and was much nicer. The tables outside are ok, wobbling as most of the patio furniture in restaurants. I asked for the mussels and fries a la dijonaise and is was only $12 (special Tue-Thur, normal price $16). The mussels were great the fries not so much, small portion and not crispy. I would come back for the mussels though."}
{"text":"Brunch is OK - not worth lining up for but not bad. There isn't much else like it in the Beach, so by default we sometimes go here. I would definitely avoid it on special holidays like Mother's Day. They pack way too many people in."}
{"text":"The service here was atrocious . The \"gentleman\" serving us was rude, dismissive and intimidating. Food took over an hour, then came out wrong . Didn't dare send it back we never would have made it out of there by midnight. Food mediocre . Never going back"}
{"text":"I love Whitlock's Sunday brunch. I have been going there for years on and off, especially in the summer to enjoy the patio. The food is always fresh and I love the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and spinach, as well as the freshly made waffles, pancakes and other food. I don't understand another review's complaint about the price - it's only about $14 for all-you-can eat, and although there's not a tonne of variety, there's enough to make this an affordable and yummy brunch. I love the patio - it's adjacent to a street but it's quiet and covered, so if it rains, as it did this past Sunday when I went with a friend, you don't get wet. My favourite Sunday buffet brunch place!"}
{"text":"Did Whitlocks change ownership or something. Been coming here for years. Usually once in summer and once in fall. Always for dinner. Place is packed, food is awesome and service spotty. Then there was tonight!!!! A block away realized forgot to make reservations. Oh well, if too long of a wait we will go elsewhere. SURPRISE!!! No line up. In fact the place was almost empty. Friday around 6:30 pm. Strange. Then came the food. Now I realize why the place was empty. Four of us. One had Ravioli. One had pasta dish and two of us had chicken parmesan with spaghetti. Spaghetti was fine. The chicken was terrible, Had difficulty cutting it with a steak knife. Impossible to chew. Flavorless!!! So disappointed. I'll never come back. Always come here with my brother and his wife when they visit yearly from Edmonton. Time for a new tradition. Grew up in the Beach. I know this place well."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for Sunday Brunch!  Especially on the patio weather permitting.   The food is good,   the omelets are fantastic made to order.   The desserts are superb.   The apple crumble is to die for!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Served by clumsy lady in yoga pants. Service was slow.   Menus were dirty. One of our menus had 2 of the same page.   We were not told about specials or offered the Prix Fixe menu advertised in the window.  The bread was served in a plastic basket.  Sangria consisted of Red Wine and a scoop of  random melon, and nothing else.  The 12oz New York Striploin was actually a 6oz grilling steak reheated in a microwave, and necessarily overcooked. The \"demi-glaze\" was actually gravy from a package. The \"Chef's Daily Vegetables\" consisted of mostly stalks. Finally, the mashed potatoes were scooped like ice cream and microwaved on a plate.  While they did replace the overcooked \"New York Striploin\" with a filet mignon, the mignon was then undercooked.   The combination of poor service, dirty menus, and mislabeled and poorly cooked food results in a rating of 1 out 5.   Would not Recommend."}
{"text":"Over the last year I've been in here 3 times.  The first two times for dinner - and it was pretty darn MEH.  It's unfortunately really, they have an alluring patio - and people seem to be enjoying themselves, but the food has generally been nothing to write home about - nor worth the price.  However, my SO's colleague drives here for brunch from Mississauga so we just had to check it out.   It was pretty impressive - especially when you compare it to my other brunch buffet experience at The Broiler Room.  It's cozy in here, so be prepared to share the general space.  They had a great selection of salads, full-sized croissants, yummy eggs benny and florentine, a pork roast, and some other foods suited to carnivores.  Most importantly, they had the waffle & omelette station.  I didn't have an omelette, instead I made it my mission to cram as much waffle goodness down my gullet as possible.  Holy doodle - those things are good.  They are small and light as air - not your normal dense waffle.  They have loads of whipped cream, blueberries, and maple syrup.  My thighs will thank me tomorrow I'm sure.  I was also impressed by the fact that juice is included in the price, service was pretty good, and overall it's a nice atmosphere.  Fruit selection was limited, but let's face it, I came here for the carbs.  All that for the low price of $13.99?  Worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Understaff, 1 waitress for the whole restaurant on a Saturday noon. Foods came so late and they were all tasteless. The servant was nice and acknowledged the problem though.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Surprised by the excellent and extremely well priced brunch. It feels like you dropped by for a big family gathering which is is why it doe not get a five star. Food is great, atmosphere is busy just like most families but like in most families there are some glitches.  Would repeat."}
{"text":"If you want food good, don't come here. But the atmosphere was great. We had a nice seat by the open windows with a slight breeze coming in. It was amazing.   Food wise, it was a 2. Service was amazing though. The staff were all very friendly and nice.  Veggie Burger - It looked like one of those frozen veggie patties you can buy at the grocery store. Well I could have done that myself. A bit disappointing. You know it's a problem when the fries are better than your burger.   Crab Cake - SKIP THIS... there was hardly any crab in the crab cake. It was mostly potato. $8 for 3 \"crab cakes\". The salad that came with it didn't look too fresh. The mayo that came with it looked as though it had been used during the buffet prior as part of it looked questionable."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to give this place a 5/5 but I just can't, although I'll be happy to return and give them a second chance. I hate HATE giving bad reviews because I know how hard people work in the service industry but I'm actually moderately disappointed in my experience. For years I've wanted to visit this venue and even though it was disappointing...like I said I'd be happy to return to give them a second chance.....  First, we were seated at a very private spot and very quickly on their patio, undoubtedly on one of their busiest nights of the year - when the place was really really FULL. JAZZ FESTIVAL was steps away. 5/5 on getting us seated quick.  Second, the waitress seemed to be in quite the rush, was not rude but was not friendly. It took away some of the fun. 2/5 on that.  Third, the waiter passed our appetizer OVER the heads of the seat beside us. I had to get up out of my chair to get my own appetizer. REALLY??? 1/5 on that one.  Fourth, I received my bottled beer halfway into our appetizer. I get it, it was a busy night, the Jazz festival - but it's bottled beer. 2/5 on that (seemed like a nice guy under stress)....  Fifth, my burger was burnt. I ate charcoal for dinner. I had to wait to get my condiments. And the fries were well done. I didn't know fries could come well done. They were not yellow fries, they were brown (I thought I ordered sweet potatoe fries), they were verging on black they were so well done. 1/5 on that.  Last, the waitress gave us the bill and never engaged in proper customer exiting social etiquette - we just paid and she left the table. Clearly....we were their as a number giving them money and not as a valued customer. 1/5 on that.   Unfortunate experience, but perhaps understandable."}
{"text":"So....I am one of those people that is *crazy* about the Sunday brunch at this place.  :)  Location is a bit inconvenient for me, but its a great excuse to make your way out to the beaches on a nice Sunday morning/early afternoon.  Good vibe and atmosphere and friendly staff. And a really nice patio in the summer!  Now for the food: I would call this high end buffet. You won't find soggy watery scrambled eggs here!! Being a vegetarian I thought they had a lot of options and I was really impressed. Awesome options include (but are not limited to), waffles, personalized omelets that they made right in front of you, potatoes, pancakes, eggs benedict florentine (seriously what kind of buffet has this!!), tons of salads (fruit, potato, roasted veggie, greek, bean, etc) and for those meat eaters there was a very healthy (or should I say unhealthy) selections of meats (roast beef, sausages etc). Enough selection to keep everyone happy.   I definitely want to make this a regular Sunday destination."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Wednesday without knowing a thing about it - just liked the look of the place and the menu.  It turns out that one woman was in charge of making the drinks as well as running the food.  We waited 25 minutes for our drinks, and it went downhill from there.  Service was outrageously slow, and the food was barely mediocre.  French onion soup was half a bowl, caesar salad was fully of slimy and browning lettuce leaves, and the pulled pork on a bun was lukewarm.  We will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Terrible food! $19 for a plate of watery undercooked ravioli! After sending it back, it just doesnt look very appetizing at all! The only good thing to comment on was their bread, it came with two types of dip!  Don't even bother with the salad, the tuna salad was basically a few spoonfuls of canned tuna & mixed greens! Not only are the food terrible, they charge highness prices! Doubt this place will last very long! Best to go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great food, very tasty.  Came with kids and another couple.   Everyone enjoyed it.  The food was very delicious, every single dish we ordered."}
{"text":"Totally awesome for brunch!   I've been here quite a few times and I like their Weekend brunch the most. During warmer weather, patio is packed so come in early. Inside, a chef cooks eggs for you. There is also a waffle maker so it's prepared as you like them.   The price isn't expensive but definitely more expensive than Cora's. Is it worth it? Totally yes. Items are the typical sausages, eggs, bacons and fruits. But there's also shells and wonderful dinner desserts. Their salad is not so so.   My experience here has always been great. During summer, reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"When I hear the words \"Beaches\" and \"Brunch\" together, I immediately have visions of packed restaurants and line ups filled with uppity parents, screeching 2-year olds and collossal sized strollers lining the sidewalks.  That's why I recoiled in horror and hissed when I saw the evite to a friend's birthday brunch at Whitlock's.  I had very lowered expectations and maybe that was a good thing because I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience.  Arrived at Whitlock's around 1pm on a Sunday and was seated right away...they take do reservations (shocking considering a lot of brunch places don't).    Friendly server came around to take drink orders while we waited for the rest of our party (shocker #2, they will seat you with reservations even if your entire party hasn't arrived).  We hit the buffet which was located at the very front of the restaurant.  The space was kinda tight.  There was a made to order omlette station and a waffle station, along with hot tables filled with eggs benedict, sausages, fried rice, fish and chips, noodles, etc.  But no bacon.  What is brunch but without bacon????  Odd but not the end of the world.  There was also a dessert section along the bar area with apple crisp, variety of cakes and fresh fruit.  Fresh salads were also available.  Headed back to our table with a heap of food and the waffles were the clear winner.  Smothered in whip cream (or as I like to call 'fat sauce') and blue berry preserves, the soft fresh waffle melted in my mouth!  Had to go back for seconds!   Coffee and tea are not included in the brunch buffet but there is a juice bar.  A selection of apple, orange and fruit punch but the juices tasted like they came from a frozen or powder mix.  Service was very good as the waitress came by several times to give coffee refills and take away plates.  Our group of 15+ was able to have a leisurely meal that spanned about 2 hrs+ time as people arrived at different times.  Whitlock's staff even provided a candle and lighter for the birthday cake.    Price was roughly $20-$22 person (with tax and tip).  A fair price for the amount of food we ate and the time we spent there.  I would gladly return."}
{"text":"I always try to find the food that combines both the yummiest and healthiest thing on the menu.  I found that here since not only did they have a delicious eggs florentine but they added a TON of salad with it.  And the dressing?  To die for!  Just enough of it and tasty, without drowing the salad with it.  The atmosphere was cozy and fun... nice seating outside, too.  We sat inside, which was a nice choice.  Here's why I'm only giving this place three stars: 1. the olive oil on the table had clearly not been cleaned; it had hair and dust on it. 2. the food took forever to get to our table.  I think we might have waited about 45 minutes for it.  And the place wasn't THAT busy either.  So, I might go back there but I'd rather try other brunchy spots in the Beaches first.  And see if these guys can clean up their act a little."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience in quite some time. My husband who has a cast iron stomach felt ill after the mussels and I too felt so bad after the lamb Poutine. The washroom state made me reconsider the condition of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Very meh. Nice ambience, fun location on Queen East. Mediocre food, mediocre service topped with a side of attitude from the server. The type of place that could easily go from ok to great if someone put a little more care and effort. It's not that hard to give decent service and put some heart in the food."}
{"text":"I tried Whitlock's out, despite the low Yelp ratings, on a rainy Friday morning for breakfast when I was visiting from out of town.  I had low expectations, but I left a fan.  We ordered the blueberry waffles and the eggs benedict with grapefruit hollandaise.  The food was all great!  The service was a little slow at first because there was only one waitress and the number of patrons was increasing around brunch/lunch time, but another waitress came along soon enough and I don't have any major complaints.  The menu says you get toast + potatoes (I think) with everything on the menu, but that's not accurate.  It was fine with us because the food we ordered basically had most of those types of foods covered anyway, so I didn't press the issue, but just be warned in case you're a stickler for those kinds of things.  Overall I had a really pleasant and yummy brunch."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday Brunch Buffet. I've been coming to Whitlock's with my family for years, and have enjoyed their brunch buffet in the past. But these days (the last year or so) the food is really a letdown. There's nothing innovative, different or have-to-have-it-here about this place anymore. The patio is great. The location for me is great. But that's all."}
{"text":"I had the Hot House Sunday buffet on my mind when we decided to go to Whitlocks. Have to say was disappointed with the selection. They had a good selection of salads, but not a great selection of meat. They had a roast beef, but it had flies on it because they set up the roast beef, omlete station and waffle station in the Window. Waffles were very good I must say. The juice was warm. Probably wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"This place SEEMS like it will be amazing when you enter.  Really nice vibe to it but the food is a bit of a let down.  Everything on the menu is very heavy an bland.  Not enough UMPH to anything really.  The nicest thing about this place that i REALLY enjoy is the breakfast on the patio during the week in the Summer.  Its a favourite for sure and the breakfast is top notch but then again, if you can't do breakfast right, you really shouldn't be in the restaurant business."}
