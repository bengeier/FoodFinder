{"text":"Authentic sushi in an unassuming location.  There aren't very many affordable, Japanese-owned and operated sushi joints, but this one is a perfect neighbourhood joint.  Excellent, fresh sushi and other sushi-based Japanese dishes.  Prices are reasonable, but not cheap.  Staff are friendly and helpful, and extremely polite.  Absolute best value is weekday lunch specials."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few months now and love this place. The owners and staff are friendly and welcoming. The sushi is always fresh and dishes are delicious. They offer a large selection of rolls, as well as lunch specials.   Favorite dushes are the sashimi appetizer, avocado salad & the tempura udon...hits the spot on a chilly night."}
{"text":"Good food! Nothing fancy, but a great, easy option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and good.   Mr Miyaki makes all the sushi himself and the wait staff is so friendly. I love the rolls and they have a buy 10 get one free. The CAA roll and Yasaii roll are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"The first time I have come here to eat Sushi. Not so many people, staff are friendly and professional. However, in my opinion, the price is not cheap.  Order more Salad is more $5 and Salmon is 4 pcs."}
{"text":"Family favorite! The owner and staff are wonderful people, we are always treated with kindness and respect."}
{"text":"First time here. Def. Not our last. At first glance the prices are a little high but we were like we'll maybe it's really good. And then you find out you get a soup and salad as well...  Not bad. Then the rolls come 10 huge pieces and we'll rolled. Still warm with the tempura. So for $10-15 on average you are getting more then your moneys worth. And on top of that our server filled our water without asking and even went out of her way to find out what a sauce contained. We ordered a spicy salmon and scallop a green dragon roll and spring rolls. And there was leftovers with 2 people and we only had to pay $33. Easily my new sushi place."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and have to say service is pretty good (when they are open on time), food usually not bad although sometimes dried out, and prices are for the most part decent.  I'll start by saying that one of the times I visited Miyaki close to its opening time, there was nobody to be found. I guess they must've been running late, but it made my trip there a bit of a waste.  That experience aside, I've found the service to be friendly and efficient over-all. Last night I ordered my meal as \"take-out\" and the speed at which it was prepared was decent at 15 minutes.  The prices are pretty good, where for the most part, each piece of sushi/maki would cost $1 or less.  The quality of the food I had last night however wasn't the best at all. Most of the pieces looked dried out and I had a stomach ache for several hours after having it. There were pieces that tasted rather fishy and the rice as well as the fish did not look very fresh (looked like they had been out for extended periods of time after having been prepared). The ginger was also served with the plastic it came with which didn't impress me.  In the past, the quality of the food has been more decent with little to no pieces of the sushi ordered looking dried out or stale and the taste being respectively decent, with no following stomach pains after being done.  Considering the health issues I had last time I visited, I don't see me returning to Miyaki, as it seems to be hit and miss when it comes to the quality of the food, and that's something I'd rather not risk."}
{"text":"I don't know about others, their sushi bentos are suck, only three small California roll and even no avocado!? Seriously? and sushi rice are tasteless, it's totally not worth 15 dollars ."}
{"text":"While the service was very friendly and fast at Miyaki, I found the food to be subpar. As much as I wanted to enjoy this smaller \"mom & pop\" sushi place, the rolls were nothing memorable. The quality of the food matches the lower price. Nothing inedible  or terribly wrong with the food, just nothing to get excited over."}
{"text":"Omg i just had the spiciest ... Spicy salmon in my life it was so good !!! My mouth is on fire but omg did I ever like it"}
{"text":"Why have I not come here before?!??  Perfect place for take-out sushi.  Fresh tasting and wonderful. Tempura appetizer has the right amount of shrimps and the sushi appetizer is so plentiful. So happy to order and so close to me.  They even have a program for buying their special makis and after the 10th order it is free.  Will come by soon when I have a craving."}
{"text":"quality of sushi was great   also service was efficient prices were decent. only thing was i experience some rudeness due to miscommunication and language barrier.  I came back with a group of friends and experienced good service by the waitress. as well, the selection is pretty amazing and the food is quite filling.  I would definitely come back now, and will probably be a regular and perhaps my first time visiting was just a communication error...lost in translation with the nonspeaking english woman."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The workers arr all friendly and ensure that our expectations have been met. The food is also fresh and the place is very clean. I will definitely recommend this hidden gem"}
{"text":"I just found out about the place, living about a 7 minute walk away.  I was really craving sushi and Sobey's barely had any left. With the bright sign outside, I decided to drop in. I had a look at their take-out prices - as a student I found it a bit more expensive than usual.   I decided to get the M2 Salmon and Californa roll, it was 6 pieces for $7.50 (8.48 after tax) I got my order in about 5 minutes. It's delicious! I have to try out their lunch specials soon.   The service there was friendly, they're all korean."}
{"text":"Picture this: it's Saturday night, your dinner plans fall through, and you have several friends coming into the city (some of whom are hungry) at various times (some as soon as an hour from now), you still haven't gotten ready, what do you do?   I quickly get on Yelp and do a search for nearby sushi restaurants (since that seemed to be the order of the day) that are open and do delivery.  Enter Miyaki Sushi, right on the Esplanade.  I called them up only to find out that they don't deliver (either that or their delivery guy was unavailable), but they were close enough that I could pick up.  I placed an order for a truckload of sushi and was shocked when they said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  Just as I was about to head out the door, I was surprised to receive a call from them saying they'd need another 15 minutes.  I was actually quite pleased by the consideration they showed in calling me rather than having me wait at the restaurant.  Quickly got showered and changed and headed with a friend to the restaurant.  I discovered that the place was a homey mom'n'pop type place and was greeted by a cute little Japanese (?) hostess who actually brought the food out to my car.  They even threw in some dumplings on the house and some ego-boosting compliments to boot.  Right then I knew they were getting a good Yelp review, but it certainly didn't hurt that every single one of my guests raved about the sushi.  It was incredibly fresh and their signature rolls just melted in your mouth.  I also felt it was a pretty good value as we were able to feed 8-10 people on under $200 and even have some left over for later."}
{"text":"Went on a not so busy  Friday afternoon for lunch. Was very disappointed with the spicy chicken bento. It was the worst food I have had in Toronto. The service wasn't too great either. The waitress seemed too busy to even come back to our table to refill our water. The sushi which came with the bento box was acceptable. Will never go back."}
{"text":"One star for quick service.  Food is MEH. Portions are measly. Ordered the tempura lunch box and it was a sad portion of food. Steamed Rice wasn't even a cup full. More like 1/3 cup only. Miso soup was full of oil.   WILL NEVER COME BACK"}
{"text":"Confession: I have a soft spot for mom & pop operations like this. I was a regular here for almost 8 years before I changed jobs and moved out of the city.   Hard working and generous too - they would usually give my co-workers and I complimentary appetizers whenever we decided to treat ourselves and dine-in instead of the usual take-out... ok, I might be a little biased due to the VIP treatment.  If you're stopping in for lunch, don't waste your time with the menu, just go with the Spicy Maki lunch combo. The old office almost exclusively ordered this at lunch. 6 pcs of spicy salmon, 6 pcs of spicy tuna salmon, AND miso soup and salad for $10.95?  Hello, yes please.  The rolls are good balance between fish and rice, no inch-thick rice filled rolls here. More importantly, they high turn-over at lunch ensures the fish is always fresh! Bonus: if they're not too slammed at lunch, the chef will add his signature twist to the maki roll and place 2 small pieces of sashimi on top of the rolls.  Have I had better sushi? Absolutely.  Have I had cheaper? For sure.  But I'd say as far as value goes, this is one of Toronto's hidden gems. Hard to beat the quality of the food that you get given the price point. And please don't misunderstand me, this is NOT bad sushi at all. Just solid no-frills sushi, like the Honda Civic of sushi.  And the staff are just super nice to boot.  The only negative thing I'll say is that if you're dining in on a busy day, sometimes the staff can get a bit frazzled. Don't take offense and just kindly flag the waitress down and let her know what you want. Some people may give it 3 stars, they probably aren't regulars. English isn't a strong point for the staff so they may seem stoic and stand-offish. But if you make the effort to engage them they will definitely try to reciprocate! If not with their words, then maybe with a little extra piece of fish ;)  Good people, good food, good value. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for take out during the weeknight. I wanted to try a different sushi place in the area. Friendly staff and ordered a Dynamite roll. Can't screw up a dynamite roll. I like that they have stamp cards as well."}
{"text":"This is a slightly biased review. I grew up on an island (Ireland) surrounded by rivers, seas and an ocean but still managed to spend my lifetime deciding I didn't like fish. I eventually realised I could eat tuna a couple of years ago but that was as far as my fish eating went.  Raw fish?  Out of the question. Fast forward to yesterday. I happened to be in the area at the same time as a friend and he was starving. He's a regular here and was in the mood for sushi. I wasn't hungry but said I'd come along for a chat. I went through that slightly awkward moment where I had to tell the woman serving us that I only wanted water but she was completely sweet about it.  She was so sweet that she came back with salad and miso soup for both of us!  I thought that was just the nicest touch.   She returned a little later with his rolls-spicy salmon and tuna ones which looked huge. We decided that it was time for me to be adventurous and taste some.  My first taste of sushi ever.  Remember, I don't like fishy things. This was yummy!  I ate 2 pieces each of the tuna and the salmon and loved them. Not fishy; just tasty, meaty and satisfying. It was a revelation!  Everything tasted fresh and our service was so friendly and smiley that I couldn't help but feel happy. So this will be forever remembered as the place I first ate sushi and liked it.  Not fishy fish that a non fish-eater will eat?  That's impressive!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and you can tell the cook/owner takes pride in his work.  His wife and the servers are friendly and always greet me with a smile. Their udon noodle soups are delicious as is their Tempura Tuna.  They also have a small room in the back that seats about 15,  where I have had supper meetings. They also have a \"buy  10 get 1 free\" program.  Can't wait to pick up some sashimi!"}
{"text":"I work nearby so I come here for  takeout lunch daily. I love their sashimi lunch special and their Boston roll! The sashimi is always fresh and tastes right.  The lunch and special rolls come with Miso soup and a salad.   Pro tip: be sure to ask for their loyalty / stamp card if you find yourself coming back more than once. I didn't realize it until I was 5 visits in!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are pretty large and fresh. My fav are the shrimp rolls and vegetable tempura. They give you a complimentary miso soup and salad with the order which are pretty filling. Nice Sushi option near Distillery."}
{"text":"I was kind of surprised to find that the other reviews for this place aren't very positive...I was struck with a sushi craving last night and it was fully satiated at Miyaki Sushi!   I must admit, it didn't look like much from the outside, but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best (because, as we all know, much like the girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead, when sushi is good, it can be very, very good...but when sushi is bad?...it is HORRID!). The staff was very friendly and attentive from the beginning of the meal until the end. They weren't very good at bringing people's food at the same time, but it wasn't as if anyone was hungry for long.   Now, I consider myself to be something of a sushi aficionado and I am willing to stake my reputation by saying that was exceptional sushi! I don't know if my fellow Yelpers went during a time where they had different sushi chefs working, but whoever was yielding the sushi knife last night knew what she/he was doing!   The prices were reasonable (but don't order Sapporo if you go here...it was 10 bucks a can...that's a wee bit steep in my opinion) and I plan to make this hidden gem my go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"Miyaki is tucked into the base of an apartment building on the Esplanade. It's a pretty small space, pleasantly decorated with the expected sushi bar acoutrements. I arrived at noon, and within an hour it was bustling with people.  The big draw has to be the prices. A twelve piece lunch tray (equal parts sushi and sashimi) as $13 which is a pretty killer deal. My DC grabbed a teriyaki lunch for $8 and both of our portions were sizeable.   Though free, our tea was only filled once. It's apparently not an AYCTea kind of place. The sushi certainly wasn't mindblowing, but it was good. A solid value for lunch.  They accept debit and credit and are also open for dinner.  Obligatory Title Pun: Wax on, Wax off-- no, wait that's MIYAGI.  Menu Readability: Like every sushi menu: filled with Battleship commands. D4 -- you sunk my hokigai! Aiyo!  Need to mention: More restaurants need to copy their website style.  What this place teaches me about myself: I need to invent a sashimi themed Battleship."}
