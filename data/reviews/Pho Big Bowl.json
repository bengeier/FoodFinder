{"text":"I've been coming here for the past 4 years and it always satisfies me. I constantly order the Pad Thai, which I feel is the most authentic Pad Thai I can find in the city. It is my favourite! It's a MASSIVE portion (can easily feed two) and for under $8. The staff there is very friendly and constantly refills my water without being asked. 

Love it here. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"This place is just not right.  The soup was decent but the meat was just wrong.  Maybe i had a bad part of the cow but the meat was just not right for pho.

We also ordered curry goat and that was wrong as well.  Taste and meat was wrong. 

It actually got worst.  The spring rolls tasted like a large veggie roll that you normally get at a Chinese restaurant for Canadians (if you know what i mean).  Lol

Ok,  maybe not as bad as I'm describing.  But i drove over 1.5 hrs from Markham to there during rush hour on a Friday night and i was hungry.  I don't know what led me to that place but i ended up in that parking lot. 

Will i come back... sorry."}
{"text":"Ordered the 44 with chicken. The chicken was old and dry. Ended up picking out the chicken and just eating the noodles and salad mixture.
I was pretty disappointed because Big Bowl usually doesn't serve unfresh food"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for Pho since it opened. (Used to be a bagel shop once upon a time). I love this place. I don't know what it is but I've been here easily 50 times + and have never had an issue. Always left very satisfied and wanting more later. There were a few times when I came here twice in one day - sometimes you just crave Pho!"}
{"text":"Rare beef noodle bowl with hot sauce always hits the spot and this place is no exception! The pork and shrimp cold rice paper wraps and fried pork wontons were yummy too. Very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Was here a year ago, but it's gone downhill. I came here with my son tonight and was really disappointed with the service and the food. Because my son doesn't eat much I asked for two bowls to split the food and was basically given a look by the waitress. And when the food came I was shocked and how little beef there was in the pho. Even the tea was hardly tinted- I looked in the tea pot and there was only a few leaves in there. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I went there this week and the food was okay...
the portion was much smaller than Toronto.??
And the servers were just talking a lot and did not care about the customers that much..
will i go back..
maybe...."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pho and I think Big Bowl is one of the exceptional ones in the Mississauga/ Halton area. Their food is great and price is reasonable. However, I think their customer services isn't that great... 
Last few times we went the orders were messed up, we werent really bothered by that until recently one of the waitresses dropped off some wonton which we didn't order. We told her thats not our order but she said they are free. Assuming they are really free, my boyfriend and I started biting to it... then another server spotted that and ran over and commanded us to stop and told us those aren't our food; and he took the plate away right away which I find it very rude. We don't really care about the free food or what not. But he sounded like we shouldnt be eating that plate while his colleague put it there.

And the worst part is less than 2 minutes later, they brought out the same plate and handed it to the table next to us... We could tell the gentlemen at that table wasn't impressed at all because basically they reserve the same plate of food to another table.

After this experience, I'm not sure if I would go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Decent pho soup, a little heavy on the salt and light on the spices but better than a lot of other pho places especially around Scarborough. This place is run by real Vietnamese people.

Problem is that they skimp out on the meat. I ordered a rare steak + brisket XL pho with extra steak for $2 more. The bowl came and I expected more meat than what I got so I questioned the waitress. 

Apparently, the normal XL steak & brisket pho only came with 2 slices of steak and mine had 7 slices total because of the extra I ordered. As any pho regular would know, these are tiny thin slices of meat so 7 slices is really not that many.

I don't go to Mississauga often but I'm assuming this is one of the best pho in the area because it was more than half full even on a tuesday night.

Not worth the trip from Scarborough for me, since Pho Dau Bo @ finch/weston rd. is better and closer."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but we had to ask for water 4 times before the disgruntled waiter brought it."}
{"text":"I don't know how the other people came up with such great reviews.  I tried the place and it was a disaster!

First, we were pointed to a table to sit when we arrived.  Table was dirty with food stuck on it so my husband wiped it with napkins he had with him.  The waitress could see my husband wiping the table but did not offer to come wipe it for us.  That's fine. 

We ordered pho with the tendon and a BBQ pork with vermicelli.  However, another waitress delivered the BbQ chicken with vermicelli and when I told her it's the wrong one because I ordered pork, SHE WAS SO RUDE and told me \"no, you ordered chicken\".  She was arguing with me what I ordered!  How on earth does she know what I ordered when she wasn't the waitress who took my order?!  She could have said, let me check with the other waitress and I would have not been upset. But I was so upset when she went and got the paper that list down our order and said repeatedly, \"look, it says chicken\" and I replied, \"I wasn't the one who wrote the order.\"  She finally went to ask the other waitress and realized the waitress had written down the wrong order.  When the other waitress delivered my BBQ pork order, she said \"I'm sorry\".  I think the waitress who was arguing with me should have come in to apologize!  

BBQ pork was so dry.  Tendon was not tendon but it was fat.  Pho soup is nothing special.  

In short, don't come to this place!  If food and service are not good, why would you come?"}
{"text":"Great place for Vietnamese food. The pho is good overall; the broth is a bit oily sometimes though. The vermicelli with BBQ beef is nice. It's the closest pho place to me so I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the beef brisket pho. The noodles are not too soft which is perfect for me and there was a lot of beef in it! I got a small bowl for ~$6 which was enough for me for lunch. 

Great portions, great brisket pho."}
{"text":"After 20 years living the area, I finally got a chance to visit Big Bowl.  It was a sunny afternoon and I could not make up my mind between Pho or Vermicelli.  I decided with the Vermicelli!  We ordered the minced shrimp on sugar cane to start.  When they brought it to our table, I was a bit taken back as was my friend on the presentation.  The sugar cane sticks were cut and we had to hold on to the cane like a corn on the cob.  I decided to be dainty and used my fork.  The minced shrimp was ok, nothing really special.

When I got the vermicelli, the presentation was pretty but my chicken look dry. And it was dry.  The noodles were flat.  The only saving grace were the vegetables.  I had to ask for a second bowl the sweet and sour sauce/broth they provide you with your vermicelli to rehydrate my chicken.

My friend's pho bowl looked good though.  I tried some of the broth from his soup and I quite liked it.  He enjoyed his meal.

We were chatty and ended up getting three refills of tea, the waitress was attentive and did not seem to mind that we were just hanging out and chatting.

Overall, I give this an average review.  I have had MUCH better vermicelli at other pho/vietnamese places.  I will try the Pho at my next visit for a true Pho experience at the Big Bowl."}
{"text":"I was in town and found this place on Google. Got in and it was a bit crowded. There was 1 person being cashier and waitress. People were waiting to pay because she was being waitress. Took 10 mins for her to take my order. I ordered Pho, spring rolls and rice w prok chopa to go.  Spring rolls were frozen then reheated, tasteless. Pho had to much herb (hi) flavor, again tasteless. I spent 45 mins. Out of which 10 mins were eating. Later on, tried my rice, worst fish sauce ever if you could call it that. Pork chop was mediocre and lacked flavors.  I guess after living in California it's hard to be pleased elsewhere but this is the worst so far."}
{"text":"Only complaint is that if you are doing take out and ask for hot sauce, you better check to make sure they give it to you (or enough of it). Too often they forget/neglect to add any."}
{"text":"The rating on here definitely does not reflect the food. Been coming here for over 6 years best pho anywhere! Not to mention they also have the best spring rolls (#01 on menu)"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place at all. Today was the PERFECT day for a Big Bowl of Pho... or a Pho Big Bowl. I was so glad that Yelp directed me to this place as I couldn't do another calorie laden Gastronomic food fiesta (much as I love them).

I'm not sure if it's a sign of popularity or a sign of bad tidings but this was my first time to a Pho joint and it wasn't packed with a predominately Asian demographic, in fact quite the contrary - caucasians abound! I thought it had snowed INSIDE for a moment!

Enough about StatsCan figures, back to the Pho. It was hot, tasty, soothing and at $7.50 for a large with an option to add extra steak and meat balls for $2 and $1 respectively, I was in Pho-king heaven!

Service was a tad slow off the hop but only because it was busy. Pro-tip, if you're traveling east or west on Dundas, there is NO entrance off of Dundas, the only entrance is off of Liruma, so make sure you're in your turning lane if following your GPS.

Feeling all warm and full now and that means HAPPY!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pho joint in Mississauga. My family and I have been customers for 10+ years! I would highly recommend, especially #53 if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"Service is bad and food is even worse. One of the severs asked the people at the table beside me if they were ready, but they weren't so she walked away while rolling her eyes. The restaurant wasn't busy with maybe only 6 tables taken so there was no reason to rush them. 

I ordered #51 steamed rice with BBQ chicken. The chicken was dry and stale. They served 2 slivers of tomatoes and lettuce which were also not fresh. 

Also, it was so cold in the restaurant that all the other restaurant guests were still wearing their jackets."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with the other reviewers about this Pho joint, they have all the elements of a classic Vietnamese restaurant, but flavour intensity is lacking the punch that you'd expect from this unique asian cuisine. I came in on my own on my lunch hour and was greeted by a guy wearing a baseball cap who appeared to be the owner. He winced when he realized I was on my own, and after the place filled up and a lineup formed I knew why he preferred full tables, this place is popular!
I would consider this more like Vietnamese fast food. I ordered the beef Pho along with some greasy spring rolls. I didn't ask for hot chill oil, but they did have a squirt bottle of Sriracha sauce on the table, good enough I suppose.
The beef Pho was ok, but after eating at Pho Hung on Spadina I realize that making this type of food delicious must be more difficult than it appears.

I'm still on a search for a Vietnamese restaurant that offers a couple of unique items that I've only had out West, lemon pepper shrimp and wings, and bread rolls, along with cheap pre made ice coffees that you can drown yourself in. I'll keep searching!"}
{"text":"I've always liked their Pho and cold spring rolls.  I've never been disappointed but at the same time, I haven't hit \"Pho Nirvana\" yet.  Service can be a little spotty at times."}
{"text":"Mice alert! 
It was a late night pho craving..found this place close to my hotel...... MICE alert. The staff caught a mouse right there in front of me. 

I paid in full. They took my money.... didn't finish my meal :("}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. Pricey compared to other Pho stores within the vicinity and the Pho is bland."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat because it's very cheap. Meals are priced from $6-$10. The pho is good but the menu doesn't have many items other than pho, and rice dishes."}
{"text":"TLDR: average quality pho, bit over-priced.

Location: easy to find, it's right off Dundas. Parking is usually not too bad.

Environment: Kind of a funky arrangement inside; seems a bit disorganized. Seating for 2-6, more on the lower end. This place can really get packed, but because the food doesn't take long to cook, the turnover is pretty fast. 

Food: As a note, they give you the order form and you fill it out yourself, then flag someone down when you're ready. Like most Asian places, they won't come by unless you're fairly assertive in getting service. I got an XL pho with brisket and round, and my friend got some veggie egg noodle stir fry. We split veggie eggrolls and the shrimp on sugar cane. General impressions were not that great. It's not a good sign when it's a cold day (below 10 with wind chill), and a warm bowl of pho doesn't seem like the most amazing thing ever. Portion size is great, but the vast majority of it was soup. Definitely didn't have more than $4 worth of actual beef in there, so I felt a bit cheated paying a difference of $3.50 for soup essentially. On the plus side, the basil and the bean sprouts are good and fresh. But the soup overall was not that flavourful. I actually drank about 2/3rds and then stopped, not because I was full but simply because it just felt like a waste of stomach space. This was after several hearty shots of hot sauce were added as well. Everything else that I had was good, nothing amazing or horrible. Bill ended up being about $32 before tip for all of that (no drinks ordered)."}
{"text":"The service is fast.  Good selection of food.  I go there all the time.  Consistent quality.  Great price."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because for the first time in years I was very disappointed with my take out order.  Not only was the chicken portion skimpy (I counted 5 thin slivers) the bean sprouts in the salad were well past their prime-- brown and old tasting.  Very disappointed considering I had to wait for it to be prepared even though I called the order in 20 minutes prior.  They have one last chance with me before I move on to another Pho place."}
{"text":"I have been to all the pho restaurants in the GTA. I went on a quest to try and find one that  I would like more than Big bowl. Time and time again I fail in my quest. Big Bowl is try best. Try the fondue!"}
{"text":"Good Pho! The fried spring rolls were ok and service was fair. These are the only reasons for not giving a 5."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad at all. Pretty good. Horrible customer service. Never ever looks up at the customers, very under maned."}
{"text":"Worst spring rolls bar none.  Worst vermicelli with egg rolls compared to ones I had before at other places.   Did not try their Pho.  I will not go back here even though it is the closest Vietnamese restaurant near me.  Decent interior decor. This place raised the price 15-20% recently.  Another reason I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is my hit up spot for the rare beef pho soup. It's consistently flavourful and the portion size is quite filling. Other options I have tried are the fresh rolls. They are chewy but most Vietnamese style fresh rolls are. The chicken wings are well cooked. My family also gets the wonton soup with egg noodles. That one needs more broth. It's quite noodly. The rice dish with pork and the spring roll is also a family favourite as long as you add lots of hoisin. It's quite flavourless without it. It's a good spot to visit when you want a good hot meal."}
{"text":"Probably among the worst pho I've ever had, very basic and bland/no taste. They only have dark meat for the chicken, which is not everyone's first choice. Decor is outdated and boring, the service was average at best, on the slower side."}
{"text":"This use to be my favourite Pho place, I've been going here for over 10 years unfortunately the quality of the food and service is now unacceptable.
The portion size is now a quarter of any other pho and the broth isn't as good, it's sour. The staff are friendly however I've been turned down multiple times because they were closing early.  

This upsets me as big bowl is a 2 min drive from my house and now I find myself driving 20-30 for a good bowl of pho."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Pho place in Mississauga. The satay pho is cooked perfectly. Quick service, with ample seating. Parking is a little cramped up. Price is just right! Perfect for a winter weather."}
{"text":"Not good..  spring rolls mediocre to bad.  Only dark meat if you order chicken (weak).  Very bland, a ton of better options in the city\area.  Worst of all; stomach hated me afterwards, gross pho."}
{"text":"I've had to update this review a few times now cause it's on of my fave places .
Over the last year I've loved this place to then not really wanted to Come cause they changed cooks ..to going to back to quality ...if they keep the current cooks I recommend the pho and vermicelli bowls , there fantastic period ! Prices are great and food is good I recommend trying vermicelli bowl #48 or any of the pho bowls but my fave is 22 
Enjoy !"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was extremely skeptical about coming here(not a fan of pho) but the bf convinced me and thank God! I had the spicy chicken satay pho and it was marvelous! Tickled all the right taste buds. The broth was outta this world, chicken was spicy enough and they don't skimp on those noodles! It's my new fav thing for winter nights:-)"}
{"text":"I don't say this often, but I actually legitimately hated this place.  I'm usually a big fan of ethnic foods, and I love trying new things but this place simply didn't do it for me.
I was dragged out here by a few friends who said the food was outstanding, and now I don't trust them with anything any more.

I went here quite a while ago so I'll have to try to recall everything from memory.  First off, I remember we were seated and had to wait a good 15-20 minutes before our server even appeared and asked us what we wanted.  I could understand this being the case if the place was busy, but it wasn't.  Once we finally did manage to order, it took another 30 minutes or so before the food even arrived, also unacceptable.  It didn't help that while waiting there was another table of people sitting nearby who felt the need to have to practically yell out every sentence they were saying to each other.  When the food finally arrived, our waiter forgot one of the dishes that we ordered so then we had to wait longer for that to arrive (I think it was some sort of spring roll dish).  When that arrived 15 minutes later it didn't even taste good, and was probably just rushed out so that we wouldn't have to wait any longer.  I remember getting some sort of thai noodle with chicken dish.  The chicken was some of the worst I've ever had, every second piece was really low quality and chewy tasting.  The noodles themselves had a really odd taste that I hated, and even one of my other friends said his food tasted bad as well.  Not sure if it was an off day or if it's always like this but I wasn't impressed.  Don't even get me started on paying the bill, let's just make it simple by saying the waiter never came by to ask for the payment and once we got his attention there were even more problems with the card machine.

I guess the interior is somewhat decent and it's nice that there's plenty of window views but this doesn't take away from the overall lack of food quality and service reliability.

If you have any respect for your taste buds and your mental well being stay away from this place."}
{"text":"My favourite local Pho restaurant. Everything I tried has been excellent."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but it's gotten pretty bad lately. Last few times we have gone we have had items missing from our food, entire orders missing so one person was left without anything to eat. We've had to point out that orders were missing ingredients. It's not as well run as it used to be. 

Also, the last time I was there I went to use the bathroom and the urinal was clogged and overflowing with urine. Pretty disgusting. 

I'd rather not go back."}
{"text":"My Dad raves about this place. Apparently, if you are into spicy, the goat meat dish is to die for. I'm more of a \"order some pho\" kind of girl, and it's not that great. Pricier than the usual $5 for small, I paid about $7-$8 for a small pho during lunch. Not expensive at all, but I guess I was expecting it to be loaded with meat. So, it was disappointing when my beef pho came with very little meat.

I will note, though, that this restaurant is an upgrade from the usual Pho shacks in Mississauga. It definitely is a place you can come with family. The decor is welcoming and the atmosphere cozy. The staff didn't speak a lot of English; but there was a lot of nodding and smiling, so it didn't feel too awkward.

All said, I'd probably go back if I was in the area and craving pho. But it's really not worth a long drive down."}
{"text":"Went to Big Bowl for lunch and the experience was just ok. We got the typical pork on rice, pho noodle soup and deep fried squid hoping that it would be as good if not better than most. It took a bit of time till we got our food but we eventually got it. The food tasted ok, was average at best my pork chop was seasoned well but overcooked and the deep fried squid looked like it was store bought and lacked some flavour. There are room for improvements and I see this place becoming a foodie spot but till then I would rate this place as average."}
{"text":"I rated this a two out of five stars mainly because I am very picky with viet food after living with parents that make home made authentic Vietnamese food (they worked in Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam). I'm also trained to make Vietnamese food too. Anyways, the pho is obviously not the best. The base doesn't have enough flavor. The spring rolls are terrible (tastes like its frozen and they heat it up compared to making it fresh at home) and the summer rolls (transparent rice paper with usually noodles, greens and meat are rolled is not pre rolled (you roll it yourself which I find them so lazy for not rolling it up for you and it honestly isn't even that hard to roll it up). If have to drizzle a lot of sauce on the food I get from here so it tastes better. I'm not sure why many of my friends are absolutely obsessed with this place (most likely because its the most closest) but its not that great."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars from me 


My friend loves coming here, i dont see her reason why. The food is not that good. The actual Pho soup here is mehh. The spring rolls here i didnt like, no flavour at all! The service is all right. The layout of the restaurant is interesting i find. 

Just like what my tip states \"iv been to a better pho, this one aint it\""}
{"text":"I go here once per month whenever I am in the area for work.  Going here tonight.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very consistent for years now and I always order the same vegetarian dish."}
{"text":"The vermicelli bowl is to die for! Very tasty and very good service. The pho broth at this place is darker than i prefer. I prefer clearer broth, but it still tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for many years. It was a favourite of ours, then they changed cooks and we stopped coming for a few years. We gave it another chance a few years ago and it was good again. 

Our last couple of visits have been disappointing again. The pho is ALWAYS good, so no worries if that's what you're ordering. The broth is so tasty and the prices are good. 

The vermicelli is hit or miss. During this visit it was obvious the grilled pork had been pre-cooked and reheated at least once. It was tough and very dry. The shrimp on a sugarcane was the same story, extremely dry. The spring roll was good. 

Spice level is another unpredictable factor here. I used to order the satay soup and it was spicy, but delicious. Last couple of visits, it's been so spicy it's almost inedible. We are big fans of very spicy food, so it says a lot when we find it that hot. 

Service is fine, but definitely not what I'd call friendly. Not unfriendly, just expressionless. 

If you like pho with tender (a bit fatty) meat, definitely get #18. It's my favourite. The hue style soup is very spicy, but has a huge amount of meat and is tasty. No blood cubes in it, which is what I prefer. 

The restaurant is generally clean and so are the washrooms. 

I'm sticking with a 3-star review as it seems to waver between 2-star and 4-star quality."}
{"text":"I like Big Bowl. 
Its my local pho place, so you can't beat it for convenience. I find the food comes out very quickly and obviously is piping hot.

Have had issues with consistency in the dishes though. There is a bun dish (no soup) that is delicious. However, the last time we went, they jacked it full of peppers. So much so, my mother could not finish the bowl. I dug in thinking she was being a wimp. NOPE. It defeated even me. And I love spicy food."}
{"text":"Really wanted pho during the winter storm and this one was the closest one we could find to my friends house. Extremely happy we didn't drive the distance to our usually spot because this pho is the way to go. It's a small joint with traditional decor (nicer than a lot of other pho places) The staff seems a bit shy but they are friendly. The pho broth is so flavourful and the portions are big. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delicious food! My new favorite place for pho. I wish they had a plum sauce or something for their spring rolls etc. but otherwise this place is amazing! Be warned though, when they say it's spicy they mean it!!"}
{"text":"Not the best pho at all. Meat pieces are too thick. Broth is on the bland-only chicken and cloves tastes. No saw leaf. Long to come out of the kitchen. 
Staff lost notion of smile and customer care.
Cha gio is not meaty enough. 
Roasted quails are on the skinniest quail side I ever had.
Not an Asian customer in the place (except my gf who likes bland pho soup more than me and forced me to give 3 stars instead of 2 to this place)."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, especially the pho.  Biggest let down is that their cafe sua da (viet iced coffee) is not from a filter but from some instant coffee mix."}
{"text":"I really have to update this. I believe from my first review that I was a bit too new to pho and hadn't experienced it all yet, but now as a pheteran, I know what's good and what's not.

This place is good. Despite learning of my very new and very severe msg allergy after eating here, I still have a very good opinion of the food here (even though there's a good chance I'll die if I eat it or any other pho again).

I ordered the #18, Beef Brisket Pho. And honestly it's on the same level as Golden Turtle, if not better (which might be due to the level of msg), but I think it was because the beef was better quality and cooked better. The noodles were steamed? I think. Either way there were cooked and moist. The broth was amazing. Just perfectly seasoned and delicious. I think possibly a bit more five-spice that made it tastier.

I ordered takeout as usual and they were friendly, speedy and efficient. Which is what I always love. So for my last bowl of pho ever, it was a great choice to end on.

The only reason it's a 4/5, is portion size. It's a bit small for the money. At Golden Turtle, I get at least 1/4 more meat. Other than that it's fantastic.

As a final note, if you do have msg allergies, I would stay away. I do believe they use more than other places, which might make your reaction worse."}
{"text":"outside looks sketchy, but inside is really really clean. The portion is small af if you order a small and there is no medium so you gotta go big or go home.

the soup is extremely tasty and I am very satisfied every time i come here.

their pork balls are my favorite appetizers!!!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty regularly because it's in our general area and my Dad really likes this place. What I would say about it is it's a great Pho place to go to and not get Pho. Sounds a little contradictory but I'll explain. I don't think their pho is exceptional. It is basic and simple but my parents seem to enjoy it very much. We've been to other pho places but they seem to like it the best (possibly out of convenience, I'm not really sure). While they often order pho, I will opt for other dishes. My current personal favorite is the Spicy Stir Fried Tofu with rice but I will often get the Spicy Stir Fried Chicken with Rice, the Pork Chop/Grilled Chicken with rice, or the vermicelli (with various toppings depending on my mood). If you want something very spicy, get the goat curry. It will make the manliest of men cry. You can always ask for less spicy or mild on their dishes and they are very accommodating to that. Service is always friendly. We come here often enough that they recognize us and strike up mild small talk which shows good service. The overall feel is very homey and cozy.

I don't necessarily think anything about this restaurant is necessarily exceptional, but it is convenient, the food comes out fast, and it is pretty cheap. They also have dishes I love that I can't get anywhere else so it does keep me coming back. I don't necessarily get excited to come here, but I am never disappointed leaving.

(Just a tip, get the Vietnamese Iced Drip Coffee with condensed milk. It is super sweet but if you really want to feel a kick in your heart beat, it'll definitely give you that.)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food but the angry lady makes me not want to go in. I even tried to avoid her by ordering take out and she answered the phone ! Eeeesh! To much trouble to attempt to be pleasant can't even say thank you if good bye. Too bad the food is pretty good."}
