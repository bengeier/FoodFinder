{"text":"Simplement un excellent restaurant, j'y mange depuis bientôt 5 ans et j'y ai toujours reçu un nourriture et un service exceptionnels. Que se soit les déjeunés ou bien les dîné, la nourriture y est toujours délicieuse. Je recommande les plats du jours pour les dînés, il change chaque jours et son toujours frais et succulents."}
{"text":"Très bon spot de déjeûner à Laval, tout près de l'hôpital Cité de la Santé.

Je vais vraiment rarement dans le coin mais l'arrivée de notre nièce a précipité la chose,hihi.
Menu régulier de restaurant de déjeûner : combos oeufs-crêpes-patates-fruits-viande en bonne et due forme, crèpes, omelettes, cocktails de fruits, café filtre, toute la patante ! 

Il y a de tout pour tous :) petite terrase dehors aussi pour ceux qui aiment manger dehors il ya une section couverte et une au soleil."}
{"text":"Decided to stay local for breakfast and give this spot a chance.

Plenty of parking is available during the weekend and the waiting line is non-existent despite \"prime-time\" breakfast at 11 AM on a Sunday. It's not secret who the clientele for this place is, mostly locals and people willing to eat a step up from the Cite de la Sante hospital up the block.

The ambiance is very warm, with big windows providing lots of sunshine with a nice looking fireplace in the middle of the joint. The seating does need a little but of love as more than one chair wobbled under me and the tables were a bit off. This type of stuff leaves an impression.

Another thing that left an impression is the impressive amount of fruit flies buzzing around. A clean sign that either trash isn't emptied as quickly as it should, the place is dirty somewhere or food kept out too long.

I ordered their breakfast special which consisted of eggs, bacon, potatoes, strawberry french toast, toast and beans. My wife went with french toast with fruits. Our impressions :

- The coffee is very strong, my wife loved it. I prefer my coffee half-strong and putting 2 milks and 2 sugars isn't the ideal way to have coffee but it brought it down to \"drinkable\" levels.

- The eggs, toast and beans were pretty decent.

- The bacon were bad, either they weren't fresh or high quality or they were microwaved. How can you screw up bacon???

- The french toast with strawberry slapped with cream cheese was a mess. A delicious mess that cancelled out the terrible bacon. 

- The potatoes were amazing. Crispy and tasty. I didn't opt for cheese but the option is there CHEESE LOVERS, they were pretty damn good!!!

All in all, it was a good breakfast. Why 3 stars though?

The coffee for one for me was pretty bad. The bacon as well. Lastly, the service was a too slow for my tastes without faulting the staff, they seemed overwhelmed which was a shame. 

I must not forget to mention that the price-tag was a bit too expensive for what I got and it's hard to compare this place to other local competition.

SORRY MICHAEL.

Would I come again? Maybe. Not anytime soon though. Too many other places to try."}
