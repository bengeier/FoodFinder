{"text":"Fantastic little Ma & Pa's place!  I've been here many times and have never been disappointed.  The meals are a great portion size, and not expensive.  The pizza's are probably the biggest hit and definitely better than franchised businesses like Dominoes or Pizza Pizza.
I've taken out-of-town friends here too, and now when I see them again they always want to go back to MK's!
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic \"mom and pop\" place in Brooklin.
Prices are super reasonable and the food is really good.  Best brunch around!
Staff is friendly.  Really great homemade desserts, try the butter tart!
The interior of the restaurant needs a makeover as it is looking run down.  They have a space for a patio but again, it needs some updating and I'd love to be able to order a pint, but it's bottled beer only, no taps.
Despite its shortcomings it's one of my faves in the area."}
{"text":"We just moved to Brooklin and couldn't wait to try this cute little mom 'n pop joint just down the street. Can't beat $5 breakfasts! We will be regulars soon enough :) We grabbed some baked goods as well on our way out - peanut butter cup banana bread... Yummm"}
{"text":"I used to come to Michael kellys for their pan pizza.  It lacks a lot of flavor but they use fresh ingredients which I like.  Whenever I got their garlic bread it had little to no garlic on it and I had to stop ordering it.  I stopped goimg because they would get my order wrong and then when I was there a woman behind the counter knew someone that was in line behind me and after waiting for too long for my pizza she  completed that persons order and served them first.  I never went back again after this, terrible customer service and a lack of care for food qualty makes it a non option for me anymore"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner from here tonight, I had the chicken parm sandwich with fries and a French onion soup. All was delicious! Loved that the fries were fresh cut!! My husband had the Swiss mushroom burger with Cesar salad. So tasty and fresh every single time.  We have been here a few times now, it's one of our favourite places in Brooklin. Would rather come here over a chain restaurant any day!!!!!! The staff is always so friendly. We will be sure to come back and have the pizza"}
{"text":"I'm mad at myself for not going to Michael Kelly's sooner. I've passed by MK's for years! It has a homey, small-town feel with wonderful food. The staff are friendly and warm. Our favourite things to order are the deep dish pizza (WOW) and the spaghetti. We are also big fans of the waffles on the weekends. The portions are generous and the prices even more so. And if you can spare a pound or two, try their butter tarts and cupcakes. The extra weight you gain is worth it."}
{"text":"Michael Kelly's is a quaint little restaurant on the main drag of Brooklin.  The diner showcases traditional diner fare and is known for it's pizzas.  Perfect comfort food with something for everyone.  

The staff was a joy.   They were extremely personable and accommodating.  The flavours were fresh, vibrant and very satisfying.  The portion sizes and pricing was beyond expectations.  

I will be back to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"Went in 23/06/2018 around lunch for a Sunday breakfast. Have been previously and really enjoyed the place. Only 4 other customers and 2 are just about to leave. Notice multiple vinyl booth seats are now fixed with vinyl or duck tape.                                     Take a seat and waitress gives us menus. Does not ask if we want drinks or coffee and walks away . 
Wait nearly 5 minutes, have even figured out our orders and menus are down on the table.  Nothing yet,
Three young men come in and she talks to them as regulars. Seats them. 
We figure maybe we get our orders taken.
Nope. She delivers 3 coffees to the young men. We are gobsmacked. 
She then cashes out 2 people leaving. 
Figure we have to be next.
Nope . she goes to the regulars and takes their order.

We leave. Never to return again . Totally disappointed . No excuse for this as the place was almost empty."}
{"text":"The best pizza, bruschetta and Greek salad I have ever experienced"}
{"text":"I'm happy Michael Kelly's is right near my office.  Their food is freshly made, the do not use preservatives, they will happily customize your order, and the Greek foods taste great!

I hear they are most known for their pizza and though it looks really good I've never had it.  I like a lot of other options on their menu... I really enjoy their sandwiches.

They are also great members of the community and often partner with other service organizations (like the Brooklin Optimists) on fundraisers.

Thanks for feeding me well Michael Kelly's!"}
{"text":"By far this is the best Mom and pop place in Brooklin.Its family run.Many of Brooklin's original residents know about this little restaurant...too bad the newbies gloss over it and visit those expensive cafeteria like places.
The food is excellent here...everything on the menu is delicious...by far the best pizza in town,lasagna is to die for...deserves way more than 5 stars.The staff is attentive and go out of their way to make your visit pleasant."}
{"text":"Nice and homey with a small town vibe.

Michael Kelly's is an excellent breakfast/brunch diner for a quick bite in Brooklin before heading to wherever your destination.

I opted for a healthier breakfast option: 2 Poached Eggs on Rye ($3.95) and my eggs were poached perfectly over easy.

Service was friendly and my coffee was refilled without requesting.

Interior is clean but a little updating would be great!"}
{"text":"Super cute, inexpensive little diner type place. The staff was attentive and polite. The food was excellent. I got a waffle with strawberry sauce. My partner got the two eggs; it came with toast and potatoes. Everything was prepared well and tasted great. Will definitely head back to try their lunch menu. People really seem to enjoy their pizza."}
