{"text":"Asked for plains wings. Got burnt wings. Not a hard job to cook wings on a grill."}
{"text":"Y u no serve takeout? And why no mozzarella sticks anymore? Everything I loved about this place is disappearing :("}
{"text":"I ordered off of uber eats from this restaurant and I specifically asked not to put horseradish mayo on my sandwich and it was on it aswell as missing part of my order. I called so we could figure out something and the lady was very rude to me and told me i had to contact uber eats and they cant do nothing ? Funny because as i recall, they are the ones making our food so why would it be uber eats fault? Very dissapointed... She also finished by interupting me and said she was very busy and had no time for me and hung up. SO RUDE. I spent 65$ and this is how i get treated. I will never be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, since it's in my neighbourhood.  I swear, I thought I had a *** or **** review of this place, I was coming to give an update.  Went there earlier in the week, during \"wing night\" Monday.  We first decided to go out to the patio, but were immediately hit in the mush with the horrendous stench of rotting garbage.  I didn't see any garbage on their patio, but it was obvious that other businesses had left stuff to rot in the back alley.  It made us do a hasty retreat to eat inside.  I got wings and fries.  Fries here were, per usual, amazing.  They're nice and spicy, I could eat them by the bucketload.  The wings, however.... Not so good.  They tasted like old rubber, and the sauce they used was definately NOT the same medium sauce they've used in the past.  It tasted like they had just been re-heated, or that they were using old wings for wing night.  As a result, I ate half a wing.  We tried to get our server's attention (there was apparently only 1 server and 1 girl working the bar, wth 8 tables inside and 1 outside), but unfortunately, she didn't return to our table until everyone was done with their meals except for me.  She offered to have the kitchen bring me new wings, but by that time everyone was done eating, I didn't want to have to extend our stay here so I could eat.  She was nice enough to take it off the bill for me, but the damage was done.  We paid and left.  Shame, I really enjoyed their wings in previous visits.  I might go back, but at this point I'm not sure if I'll chance it, with the number of options in my neighbourhood"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a real sports bar in this neighborhood, and Toronto for that matter. In many ways it's a reflection of the community. Not like other neighborhoods who's sports bars have a specific cultural affiliation, a bouncer or a dress code. Food wise, it's fairly typical. BUT...This place has great poutine and wings. Maybe the best in the city. Nightly booze specials and enough televisions to fill anyone's needs. Not to mention a kick ass backyard patio. Great Toronto watering hole!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch.  Big tasty burger!  No relish in house seemed odd.  I've had wings and watched the game here before. Awesome \"Canadian\" bar"}
{"text":"OK, this place is the bomb!  I am not a sports gal, and not a fan of sports bars.   But consistently being in a friend circle of people who live and breathe hockey, I am gonna get dragged to this place a lot.  waiters are so kind, and patient. they have to be because the crowd there is LOUD on game nights.  no jerks though, just serious leaf fans. which is what i enjoyed.  Huge portions, tons of selections, wicked prices, & the hangover poutine looks pretty wicked.  And a ton of fun on leaf game nights.   tons.   & I don't even like hockey."}
{"text":"Attended on a Monday wing night with a crowd of Leaf fans and an empty stomach.   They had several flavour options for the wings, and an option to have them baked or fried. After a sweet dodgeball game win we treated ourselves to the baked dry cajun and baked medium hot seasoned wings and were pleasantly surprised. They were fresh and hot and... gluten free!  Otherwise, they didn't have a substantial menu, but a healthy sized one with reasonable prices and 10+ beers on tap.  Approx. $20 for 2lbs goes down even smoother for me (as did the drinks).  Would recommend for watching a game or hanging with friends (and groups)! Bar food doesn't insight an automatic cringe in me anymore! Hurrah for the Hurricane!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place Is receiving 4 stars and not 5 is because 1 time we went there the server was horrible BUT every other time we've been the servers have been fantastic!!  The wings here are amazing. I've eaten wings all around the world and these are right near or even at the top of the list - you have to try grilled honey garlic   The drinks are drinks you all know what booze tastes like  Servers have all been really friendly and fast (except for one, who apparently forgot we where there that night)  You should definitely check this place out for a few drinks and a feed. Will be frequenting this place that's for sure"}
{"text":"Want a spot where the patio smells like 200lbs of leaky diapers? A spot with no AC inside, food that tastes and makes you feel like it was prepared in proximity to 200lbs of leaky diapers? Where you're surrounded by clientele that is OK with that sort of environment, then go to Hurricanes."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst. The wings are small, dry, miserable and pathetic. The nachos are honestly hilarious... they were burnt and disgusting! The only toppings were olives, small bits of cooking onions, some disgusting burnt canned cheese blend and NoName Salsa! They actually drizzled the disgusting NoName salsa over the burnt nachos! And then presented it with the smallest plastic container of sour creme! (1 or 2 tablespoons) It was $14! I've NEVER had food SO bad as at Hurricanes! I was with 3 friends-- we are all very generous tippers, even under mediocre circumstances... but this service was a joke. The server was RUDE AND INATTENTIVE. She made it seem like a chore every time we ordered another round; it was ridiculous. We spent over $200.00 combined and will never be returning.  AVOID This place!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Toronto hands down!!! Canes sweet heat is delicious. Customer service isn't the greatest otherwise would have given a 5"}
{"text":"the new menu is unreal, the brisket sandwich or dinner is the BOMB. Mac and Cheese is homemade and so so so so good. Bartenders and servers who actually want to serve you as well, plus whatever big game is on, they have got it playing. Great neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"This place has greatly improved in the last few weeks ,mainly due to the new cook staff. I hope they continue in this new direction. Definitely try the grilled wings. A great place to take a second look ; especially lunch."}
{"text":"To start, food was a four, solid portions and yum. This is more a comment on service. Heavy western vibe here, It's a very cheers vibe layout. U get a great bang for your buck for breakfast which is all day and only 10 bucks. Only comment is our server was sassy and rolled her eyes at us a few times at basic requests like can we split the bill. I get that can be annoying but it really wasn't that busy when we were there so a tad sassy in my book."}
{"text":"I completely forget that prices can get reasonable again when you leave the downtown core. Pleasantly surprised that everything on pub menu was 5ish bucks cheaper AND the same greasy deliciousness to boot, I ordered me some pubfare, a Guinness and watched the hockey game (they play Canucks games!) while listening to some less than stellar Karaoke singers on a Wednesday night.  PROS: -unpretentious, as everyone else has noticed -good folks.  No frat boys to roll your eyes at.  No weirdos that you need to avoid eye contact with. -GREAT bar (a grade A bar consists of 1) purse hooks; 2) stools that swivel and have a back rest; 3) stools with appropriately placed foot rest; 4) bar with a foot rail or general shelf/gradient that is not the floor)  This place hit ALL those things. -Clean washrooms -Queer friendly (you don't usually get that from a lot of bars where I live- it's nice to have an \"all-inclusive\" feel- feeling comfortable that everyone is welcome. -did I mention Karaoke?  where there a couple good people but the overwhelming majority seem to be tone deaf with amazing performance skillz?  Totally fun.  CONS: The bar \"corner\" is usually my favourite place to sit and it is awkardly close to the washroom entrance.  which is only a slight con. -The draught selection leaves something to be desired.  I like a few options for dark porters and stouts.  They only had the standard Guinness.  Which I gave another shot because they didn't have anything else that was dark (btw- sleemans cream ale is NOT considered dark, people).   Turns out, I still dislike Guinness.  So all in all- I'd totally come back and reccommend this place. Give me a few more nights listening to awesome attempts at Journey and old country and I bet I can add one star for this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Super friendly and accommodating staff. Good mix of people/patrons - Great beer selection and the best pub grub in the area - the wings are the best in the city, I'm not sure why blog TO or dineTO hasn't mention their wings on their best of lists."}
{"text":"Great small pub with daily food and drink specials."}
{"text":"Hurricane's is a great little bar/restaurant in the Bloorcourt neighbourhood. It has just about everything you'd want your local watering hole to have:  Pub grub, a full bar, music, sports fanatics and every night has a special theme. Tuesdays' are 2-4-1 wings (which has in the past been my night-usually with a pitcher and the Leaf's game), and Wednesday's are karaoke (very fun to watch).    As basic pub food goes, try the wings or their fish and chips!"}
{"text":"I really quite love this sports bar. I have been to Hurricanes a number of times for quiet drinks, to watch hockey, for wings (which are pretty darn good!).  This place kind of feels a little bit sketchy, the ladies washrooms are not the best but they are not dirty! However it is reasonable priced, when there is a sporting event the place is busy and you can get pitchers as I recall. What I loved about this place when the hockey was on T.V; any time the Leafs scored the horn sounded and blue lights flashed. Fantastic atmosphere!   It is relaxed, bar staff are friendly, great mix of clientele! Small patio with some shelter.   Brunch: cheap as chips/home fries in this case. Expect to pay $7-10 for brunch. The farmers feast is epic value for money and you will be stuffed (advise, wear your elasticated meat pants for that boy!)"}
{"text":"Great wings, not too big but the Mon/Tues 1/2 Price deal is good. The Mexi-fries are great too. Very low key, a little divey but I don't mind that at all. The chef specials are quite good too, especially the ribs/wings/salad/fries for $11. What a deal! I'm pretty much a regualr due to the lack of sports bars in the area and they have lots of tv's in HD for games."}
{"text":"Processed cheese in the quesadilla. They had a great menu last year and some stuff has changed since. The price point has stayed the same but some of the ingredients have gone downhill. All but one of the servers are great. One of them constantly walks around with perpetual distaste for her customers. Never once have I seen her smile. There are an infinite amount of reasons why this can be, I understand that, but given I come here a lot and have never seen a shift from the usual hatred and disdain, makes me wonder how she is even working in this industry. It astounds me. It is kind of amusing though when all is said and done. To be able to maintain a scowl the entire night? Talent."}
{"text":"We just waited an HOUR for food. An hour!!! For fried bullshit. An hour!!!!! WTF?!?!?"}
{"text":"This is another favorite place I go to for wings.  My favorite are their grilled wing with Canes Sweet Heat.  Wings are often juicy and have a nice smoke taste to them.  It comes with either fries or veggies sticks.  They got half price wings on Monday and Tuesday but you have to buy a drink.  If you haven't tried grilled wings before you should definitely come here."}
{"text":"Super cold day today,  would have been awesome to have a curtain by the door to help with that draft.   All good,  let's drink more beer to keep warm.  Nice staff and great music... Hello there The Cure."}
{"text":"I have a friend who lives nearby, so whenever I'm in the neighbourhood visiting her, we always plan to meet up here for cheap drinks.   I like this joint. It has a relaxed, unpretentious atmosphere that attracts a mixed crowd from the neighbourhood. Yes, it's kind of divey but compared to some, it's not full of derelict characters nor irresponsible fratboys getting drunk on Bud Lite so I have to say that the Hurricane's is a-ok in my books.   I've only tried one thing on their menu and it was their burger with a mixed green salad on the side. I have to say that the burger was delicious, moist and peppery, and I was unable to stop eating it until it was done. I also remember being really hungry but also it was a damn good burger! With a pint of beer, the order came to a cheap price of $11, which isn't bad for a local watering hole in Bloorcourt."}
{"text":"Food isn't very good. The nachos are ok. Service is hit or miss. Not the cleanest place i've ever seen. good to watch a game"}
{"text":"Hurricanes: the plural of hurricane. After drinking since 5pm, and eating everything at Woodlot -- I mignonette everything at Woodlot -- I still wanted fried mozzarella in tube form. And, the table shunted me for it. I slammed my hand down on the table and it got stuck to it. That's when I realized I liked this place. The fluorescent made the shadows stark and my squints large. The imperial pints -- that's how Canada do! -- made me continuously happy. While I walked in a hurricane, I left a stable chap."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by the food. I was expecting mediocre but instead received above par pub food that was quite good (esp for a vegetarian!!). The food here is WAY better than any of those chain places where you might go to watch sports (Louis Wings, Kelsey's,  Shoeless Joe's, even Milestones etc. or any of those type places). Forget about those places, they are garbage compared to this place. Additionally this place has a very genuine feel to it and I really like it. Some might say it's a dive, but I say it has character."}
{"text":"So, I was in Toronto for the night, and was looking forward to meeting up with a buddy  He's a Leafs fan (nobody's perfect) ,and recommended we meet here( his local) to watch the game and have some brews  We took a seat at the bar, which had a great view of the TV's, and I ordered a pint of Mill Street  Amber . It's a stand up beer, very tasty and reliable  Got a little hungry, and ordered the chicken fingers with fries, and a side of gravy. They were delish, and the gravy was awesome  So yeah, the Leafs lost, but we had a grand time. Good little place"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food because we didn't order any, but the drinks were cold.  The service was good.  If you like sports, like my husband and his pals this is a great place to go.  They've got a million TVs all playing different sports games."}
{"text":"Hurricanes is great! Cane's sweet heat is the best wing sauce ever. Nice patio at the back."}
{"text":"This would be a great bar if it was a completely different bar.  However, having said that, they do have alcohol and food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is good, and affordable. Their half off wings on Mondays and Tuesdays are a must, and my favourite time to come here!! Casual atmosphere, and great place to be during big sports nights. Their fries are amazing, and I love their poutine."}
{"text":"Thanks to a killer hangover on New Years day, I was wandering the streets desperately looking for ANY place that was open who could serve me hot food. Hello Hurricanes! I had never even taken notice of it before, but thank God it was open.  Needless to say, I didn't even think of trying out their bar menu thanks to the pounding in my head. But the food.... AMAZING. Best pub food I have ever had. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken wrap. And the prices were such a  good deal.   The bar itself? Maybe a little dirty. I think I can chalk that up to not enough waitresses working (STAT holiday and all that). When I go back soon, I am confident that it will be a little more organized... well, hopefully."}
{"text":"We had been coming here for years we stopped about 5 years ago because the menu changed and it tried to be something it wasn't. It's a dive bar and that is what was fantastic about it.  We decided to give it a try again because I really needed a cold beer. We had Mill St. Organic and honey garlic and medium grilled wings. The wings were really delicious and the grilled flavour goes nicely with tge sauces. However, what the frig is with the plates!???  Serve bloody wings in a basket with a bowl for the bones the plates are too big for the tiny bar tables.  If they just embraced their dive bar glory it would have been a great experience.  We are so going back on 2-4-1 wing night."}
{"text":"Apparently there is a patio that is often quite gross and has some stink issues. I almost sat there last night but was quickly warned not to. (NB: Apparently it has to do with the neighbours, and not Hurricanes.)   Last night I tried their wings and Margaritas, and I was terribly disappointed. Really sweet and not very boozy on the drink front, and the wings were dry and not very saucy.   I hate to do this to a place in my hood, but the time is now. You're being demoted H. Roadhouse."}
{"text":"The first couple times I came here I was severely disappointed. Their nachos and house beer were wretched to say the least. BUT, over the past couple of months, I've been coming here and been pleasantly surprised. I really wanted to like this place because of it's proximity to my apartment.   Something must have changed, because all the food I've tried lately has been amazing. Honorable mentions are the spicy buffalo poutine, cane sweet heat wings and the beef brisket sandwich. I also like the fact that there is usually a drink special. I can't really speak for anything other than beer, I'm a beer drinker usually.   Also, I've been getting to know some of the servers, so hopefully I can get the lowdown if the nachos still suck.  This place is dependable and open late all week, which is great when you are a shift worker like myself.  Dive bars are the way to my heart."}
