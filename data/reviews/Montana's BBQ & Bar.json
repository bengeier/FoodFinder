{"text":"I came here once and will never come back.   The food was not just terrible, it made me sick. I ordered the oven baked antojitos, and all I could taste was cheap, squishy cheese. I spent the next morning throwing up because of the two antojitos I did eat.   We also ordered the spinich dip, which was okay, but the waitress mixed up our order and gave us cheesy bread first. She wouldn't admit her mistake and made it out to be our fault. Overall the service was cold and unfriendly.   Food was terrible, service was terrible. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"This is pending since long. I really like the food here. This is one place I prefer visiting every week for dining during weekends. Two of the most delicious things they have, are kapow shrimps and four cheese spinach dip."}
{"text":"Visited the 401-Dixie location on a weekday for a team lunch. I'm glad we had a reservation, this place gets busy. We were a group of 11 people and we enjoyed our time there. After we were seated our server(Sarah), introduced herself and took the drinks order. The drinks were served quickly and then another server came and took our orders for the food. This guy seemed more experienced. He really handled all the crazy requests very well. The food took really long to come out, which wasn't a surprise as they got the food for the entire table, out at the same time instead of bringing it out in batches. On our table, I ordered a veggie burger, it was a bit expensive($14) but tasted good and was huge in size, someone else ordered a chorizo flatbread and he was happy with it too. Another friend got the SmokeHouse Wrap and said it was a steal for that price. He absolutely loved it.   Overall, good place to hangout with friends. Staff is very welcoming and also very attentive. Will certainly go back."}
{"text":"The new appetizer menu was delicious. Three of us ordered steaks, all of which were cold. Two of them were well done so I'm not sure how that happened. On a good note, they were nice enough to comp two of the steaks. The service was friendly and overall the experience was a good one."}
{"text":"Had the ribs. A bit dry and the sides were just okay. Good selection on the menu and worth a look. Price was mid range and there were no drink specials. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"My chicken caesar salad smelt like cat litter....never eating here again."}
{"text":"Montana's Cookhouse is great! The Caesar salad is the best salad I've ever tasted in my life!!!!! Waiters are friendly, indeed. And the restrooms are great. Service is excellent. Also, the kiddie menu has a good selection of healthy foods. I very apt to go there again."}
{"text":"I was disappointment in this place and will not return!!!  They advertise all you can eat ribs Wed.  You have to order the ribs priced at $29.99.  My son ordered them and received the first portion which was a reasonable amount.  The second portion was smaller and the third only 3 ribs on the serving. Rip off!!!  I can only eat a small amount of food so opted for the poutine with beef ribs and cheese curds in the gravy.  Couldn't find the cheese or meat in the dish.  The gravy tasted canned!  And outrageous priced $9.00 for what was a small portion of fries and canned gravy.  The 2 waitresses kept walking around to ensure I did not eat any of my sons ribs!!!  They took my little plate away as soon as I was done so that I did not have a plate to sneak in a rib or two."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night and our waitress Susan was great with her customer service.  The food, however, was only ok. I was excited for the pulled pork menu but the stuffed chicken was quite small for the price and the bbq sauce tasted like jam :/ also, way too sweet. I'll come back to order from the regular menu."}
{"text":"If you want a glass of ice with a dash of Clamato, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"There is a certain ubiquity that you can expect at bigger chain restaurants like Montana's. You know you won't be blown away by the food or the service but more often than not it is a pleasurable experience.  This is precisely how I would describe this particular Montana's. I've been here for lunch, dinner and drinks and it is impressively average. I haven't had a bad experience here and the food and drinks and have always been good and fair priced.   For what it's worth I found it more enjoyable for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been to montanas several times and food was great. First time here ordered the bison burger is was dried up and barely anything on it for taste, the sweet potatoes fries were over cooked and dried up not a fan, will not return.Service was ok but not great especially since wait for food with only 3 families at restaurant."}
{"text":"I walked in to eat here and the place literally smelled like a dirty barn. Turned around and walked out before we we're even seated."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place hoping it'll improve, no such luck yet."}
{"text":"Last night I had dinner with my family at the Steeles & Don Mills Montana's in Toronto. It was the absolute worst experience I've had at a Montana's restaurant. Upon arrival we were seated in a very crowded portion of the restaurant, while the host told us that we were not allowed to sit in the other half of the restaurant. In no way was the area reserved, and when we asked another waitress why this was the case, she replied with \"it shouldn't be, but you have to sit with the other diners on that side\". We requested to move seats after the back of my seat kept hitting the seat of the person behind me (yes, I was sitting back to back with another guest - it was just that crowded). We sat for approximately 10 minutes and had the opportunity to view our menus and select our drinks, but no server arrived. Only after requesting the hostess to call our server, were we greeted by a gentleman who introduced himself and said he will give us time to select our food & drinks, then ran to the kitchen. By this time we were close to leaving, as the restaurant seemed to only be run by one server. Despite our hunger, we waited for the server to appear and called him to take our orders. We received our drinks fairly quick, but our food only arrived approximately half an hour of a long wait after receiving our drinks. Seeing past all of this, we ate our meals and promptly left. I thought that would have been the end of it until this morning my family who attended dinner last night all suffered stomach sickness, including myself (the commonality between our dishes was pulled pork). I am usually an advocate of Montana's, along with their rib nights; However, this was an absolutely terrible combination of bad service and atrocious food, and it will certainly be the last time I consider eating at Montana's."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the identical meal. The grilled chicken with grilled tomatoes, On a bed of rice. The picture in the menu looked so yummy. When we got the meal. We stared at our plates and asked ourselves. Did we get the right order. The chicken was over grilled, tough and tasted like a dirty  BBQ grill. The rice was soggy, and the tomatoes, found 1/2 a cherry tomato  It was almost  overcooked, brown mushy, mixed with mystery vegs. Not very appealing  Everyone around us got their meals before us, but we were there first  We called the waitress over and asked her, if this was the grilled tomato chicken. She said yes,  I asked her were are the tomatoes. She said the vegetables were seasonal. The manager and the head chef also came over.  Same conversation with each. They took $10.00 of the bill, big deal. The food was over bland,  cooked, greasy, dry. Just plan awful. Will not go back to that location."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, Tuesday is kids night.  Was there with my 2 kids they had a balloon guy very funny and talented balloon animals.  Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Went here for supper last night, terrible service, terrible food, terrible experience.  We were seated and had our drinks ordered and brought to us promptly, as well as menus and crayons for our toddler. Order was also taken promptly.   Then we waited.   45 minutes later, after everyone around us had gotten their food, eaten and left, and we had no attention given to us whatsoever since getting our drinks, we pulled our waitress over to ask if our food was on it's way. She said something about the order being up on the screen, which meant nothing to us since we didn't work there so we were just confused.  Finally our food arrives after more than 45 minutes, appetizer (which we specifically said we'd like to start with) and all.  My ribs were completely dried out, hard and chewy, and were minuscule. Definitely not worth ANY money. Waitress said that they ran out of cornbread, would garlic toast be alright? I said sure, that's fine! Never came. Grandmother's food was fajita, but the vegetables were completely raw on the skillet, so she had one but couldn't stomach that much raw onion. My husband's burger and poutine was the only good meal.  Halfway through eating the waitress came back, asked my husband how his meal was, he said good, and she quickly left as I opened my mouth to tell her about my terrible ribs. They sure paid attention to us when it was time to pay.  Definitely not wasting out time or money here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here a few times for lunch and our experiences have been ok each time. It never gets busy during the weekday so getting a table immediately is guaranteed. The wait time for the food to come varies though. I've tried their pulled pork sandwich and ribs with yam fries while my friend always gets the brisket burger. I do think the flavour of the brisket is the best out of the three as it's juicy and tender. I found the pulled pork to be a bit on the dry side despite being doused in sauce. The ribs were not bad and this is one of the few places that don't cook your yam fries to death. Overall, it's an ok restaurant with mediocre BBQ food."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Late and order was massively messed up. Extremely disappointed! Might have to go to another location from now on. Two for the food, Zero for service!"}
{"text":"Good \"saloon\" like steak house/bar. Service was friendly and food excellent. recommendable is the 10oz steak plate. Great value for money. they could throw in a discount for the guests coming from the nearby Hilton Hotel - this would make it a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"I find nachos a risky dish to order when eating out, but going on a recommendation from a foodie friend of mine I decided to give Montana's nachos a go and they were perfection... perfection being multiple layers of cheese (not just a top layer). We got the guac for a dollar extra, and it was worth it.  Perfect for sharing. Also, you can't go wrong with their veggie burgers, there's something in the seasoning where the planets align and the goat cheese crumbles just so. Yummers."}
{"text":"Arrived just before 8pm on a Friday night. Came with my 8 year old son for a late dinner. Had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table meanwhile they had a few tables open that I could see. The waitress promptly arrived, took our drink order and returned minutes later. We then placed our food order and went to the restroom to wash up. The ladies room smells like an outhouse. No joke. So gross. So, back to waiting for our food. It took quite a while. Long enough to deter me from coming back. When you're hungry, it's hard to be patient and I realize it isn't a fast food establishment. But when you're hungry, you're hungry. I ordered a medium well steak and fries and little man ordered chicken fingers and fries. Took a total of 25 minutes to arrive. My steak was a bit warmer than room temperature. Not impressed, again. Fries were hot so it was just poor timing by be kitchen staff. Food was flavourful. Steak was fairly tender but still too pink in the center for my liking. Will probably return one day but wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"came in after leaving a terrible experience at a surrounding restaurant. it was a slow time (weekday before dinner)...and it was just te bartender working. we sat in the dining room and had some of the best service ever. being in the Industry, I appreciated how often she came by to see us even though we were the only ones in the dining area and she had several other guests in the bar.   food was delicious as well, try the chipotle chicken wrap!"}
{"text":"Eating here reminds me of being in the country side or in a old west salon. The food here is similar to places like the keg. I had the ribs and wings. I enjoyed it. The ribs meat slide of with ease."}
{"text":"As Montanas' go, this was good. Friendly service, hearty helpings and so on. Yummy, tender chicken tenders. Possibly the best i've had--but such things can vary, of course. A few moments of inattention and they would have been less tender and closer to mediocre. But not this time--this time they were precisely what chicken tenders should be--yum!  Companion's back ribs and wings were good too! Chain food, yes, but tasty all the same. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Service was very nice food was bad get the stake was owner cook very expensive for the quality of food I will not go back ever gain"}
{"text":"Tasteless, overpriced.  Management could learn more about customer service.  Chicken was not squirting blood but was rubbery and tasteless.  The rice tasted OK.  Keep going past, not worth the stop."}
{"text":"I have to say since last I visited, they have expanded their menu considerably. Not so much that I have faith enough to go back and try again. I don't recall anything memorable about this restaurant"}
{"text":"No waiting for seat or service but in all fairness was before 5pm as I had no lunch today.  Server offered happy hour pricing early so Beer n Burger was in order.  It's Montana's so menu and food always consistent and good."}
{"text":"We were there couple of times, base on a price, they had a great customer service, the foods were good especially the grills foods,  It has a good environment specially if you gonna go with kids,"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful, walked in and sat at the front desk for 10 minutes waiting for someone to serve me and my friends. When we got fed up we sat ourselves. Again we waited 15 minutes at our table and still no service. It was only until we had two waiters stop, look at us and walk away with a disgusted look on their faces that we left.  I've never had such appalling service.  Their management needs to be re-evaluated and needs major amendments. If I could I would give 0 stars as their was NO human interaction."}
{"text":"Practically our entire experience at Montanas Cookhouse today was a fail. From dirty side plates, to warm drinks.. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant. We even asked for ice on the side & didn't ever get it. Our server recommended we order a pitcher (3 glasses) of lemonade for $18.99 - afterwards we realized we could have bought each glass seperate for $5.49ea. What a sham."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this location a 3.5 so i just settled on 3. Where do I begin.... Ok tonight I had the tacos they were great. The chicken had this blackening seasoning on it that made it a lil spicy.  My fries were cooked a lil too long so I didn't eat them, let down.   My friend had the salmon which he said was \"the best salmon I ever had\" with every bite.  The salmon came with dirty rice that wasn't fully cook.  It was still hard Also a let down :(   Our server was very friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed.   Overall wouldn't go back to that location"}
{"text":"That is really bad eating experience. Food is not tasty and just like frozen one. I need wear my winter jacket to eat, no heating inside. It is my first visit, and will be last too."}
{"text":"Worst Montana ever. Some pointers here:  1.  Don't believe in reservations as this place is clueless to what a reservation is. Hostess doesn't know what is going on and disappeared. Left us waiting.   2.  Our server lacked common sense, very forgetful and impatient.  She took down the wrong order and won't admit it.  No apologies.  Other servers had to bring our food.  Other tables around us had the same complaints.    3.  Manager gave us complimentary desert which was a plus but I'd rather her fire her incompetent staff."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a good but not expensive steak. Sometimes they have deals... I remember an all you can eat ribs for a dollar more (did it because you think you can do it)... my son and I could not get past the first plate."}
{"text":"For your typical Cara food joint this place is pretty hit or miss. I've had good experiences and sub par. Recently the food was pretty disappointing as was the service. We ordered chicken fajitas, a burger and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The fajitas were just okay (how can you screw up fajitas!) and the burger and sandwich buns were hard as rocks. we also waited over 35 minutes for our dishes and it did not appear to be busy at all."}
{"text":"I just left there. I had an excellent Bison burger and fries and my wife has a very good Canadian Burger Eh! with a tasty Cesar salad. The waiter Envi was more than pleasant. Would go back again. Next time I think I will try the steak"}
{"text":"We left the Sunridge Spectrum looking for a decent meal. We found our way over to Montana's but it left us less than impressed.   The table was left sticky from its previous guests and our server didn't bother wiping it off.   She took our drink order, took our meal order and then disappeared. She only returned to take away our plates and ask us if we'd like the bill.  She might have learned that my steak was done to medium, not medium-rare as requested. And that I had received crispy onions, even though I requested they not be included with my meal.  She may have been left wondering why her tip was so meagre.   We were not."}
{"text":"Firecracker burger and fries.. Not that good at this location.  Service seemed annoyed that we had small children. Place was empty at 530pm.  For the price, we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Picture a seeing a cheeseburger being delivered to your table. You are famished and have been waiting for this moment all week. You go to take a bite and the bun is the hard and dry, yet the burger is succulent and condiments are the tastiest and freshest that has ever hit your lips.  This summarizes my families recent trip to Montana's.   My wife and I made reservations this past Saturday afternoon for our family of 4 plus 4 of my daughters girlfriends to celebrate her 9th birthday after watching Nanny McPhee ( small c BIG P) at her favourite restaurant.  I want to emphasize MADE reservations here over the phone prior with the GM. Anyways, we finished watching the movie and walked over to Montanas. When we arrived we were about 30 minutes early. Insert hard and dry crust. The restaurant was not busy at this time with maybe 4 groups sitting at tables. We waited over 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we had came through the doors. Now, one of the first things I was taught in retail is to make an effort to connect with anyone who walks through your doors. Apparently, Montanas Whitby did not attend that training. I had to finally walk over to the bar to get someones attention. Finally when a waitress came over we said we had made reservations for 8. She checked and then realized someone must have given away our table to another party. Just like Senfield said, \" they know how to take the reservation, but they don't know how to HOLD the reservation. How can you give away a table that was reserved. Another 5 minutes passes for her to put together the table.   Insert juicy cheeseburger. The waitress was okay through the service. She had a friendly disposition in dealing with the children. The food was fresh and hot when it came to the table and everyone received the orders in a reasonable period of time. We one girl who came just for the dinner and arrived after everyone else received their dinner. By this time, it was around 530 and the kitchen was backed up. The waitress put in a good effort letting us know how long the last order will take but could have offered to bring out her salad first if the burger was taking longer.  She brought out a special dessert for my daughter and they sang the b-day song for her which was great and we appreciated. She was a touch embarrassed and we got some good photos of her with the huge moose antlers. A person who looked like a manager came over and asked how the service was and I explained what happened in the beginning and he did apologize.   Onto the the dry and crusty bottom part of the bun. When we were settling up the bill, the total came to just under $80. I am not complaining of the price at all. Excellent to feed 2 adults and 6 children for just under $80. But I do have a problem when I gave the waitress 4 $20's and she returns with a $20 bill and change. I asked her if she had change for the $20 bill she gave back to me and she replied that someone just paid with a $100 bill and she didn't have change. REALLY? No one in the restaurant has 4 $5 bills for a $20 bill! WOW! You expect and are forcing me to tip you $20 after what happened when we first walked in? I felt insulted. I then asked if she could check with someone else for change and she then comes back with 4 $5 bills. Real slimy tactic by the waitress to get a couple extra bucks.   I will not be returning to this Montana and will be talking my daughter into going to next favourite restaurant which Safari Bar and Grill."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, excellent spicy sauce, good service and kind people. I tried the ribs and was awesome, I loved the taste and complements are also delicious, prices are good for what you meat and portions are also adequate, good place for meat lovers!"}
{"text":"I've had both bad and good experiences at this location. Though the good have defiantly out weighed the bad. Plus the food is pretty darn good. If you like some where quite and relaxing I wouldn't recommend this place. However if you are going for a birthday dinner or to watch UFC/ Hockey game I'd totally come here.   I'd still come back to this one again."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Montana's location on an almost bi-weekly basis for nearly 4.5 years. If that commitment to this restaurant doesn't speak for itself then...well, it should.  Also, I have thoroughly enjoyed the food, menu items ranging from novel & creative to common & staple. I haven't had a bad meal yet (after visiting 120+ times). The staff tend to be awesome (especially Peter and Zeticia). And the prices are reasonable.  Highly recommended, especially lunchtime."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 2+ hours to get your food, come here. Our group of 6 waited for our food for 2 hrs and 30 minutes. We waited for our food and the food was unsatisfying food that didn't fit what I had had at montana's in the past. I wouldn't come back for my greasy over seasoned fish and chips."}
{"text":"Mess. Been waiting for our food for 1 hour and 33 minutes. We ask the hostess what's going on and she said there is a \"meltdown\" in the kitchen. Ok.. Then the server comes up to us and told us not to feel obligated to stay bc he has no idea how much longer it'll be.. Wow. My drinks better be free."}
{"text":"Food took too long to get to our table and beef fajitas tortillas were soggy and looked like they had been sitting all day. Sent them back and they never came back. Burger came with the wrong fixings as we asked for it with nothing on it and made that very clear. Nothing was done until the manager came around to take plates away and she didn't even know about the issues before that. The salads are your best bet if you go there"}
{"text":"2 different Sunday's I tried eating at Montana on steeles both times some reason they couldn't serve customers. So we left and went to the one on yonge in Richmond hill. Do your self a favor go to a different location. System errors was one reason and the other sunday they had no hot water??? Who is running this restaurant??? Horrible"}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch last weekend with a friend. The service was slow and it just appeared that the servers didn't care. We waited there for about 35 minutes after we ordered. Would rate them zero in customer service. We ordered a vegetarian burger and ribs and reminded the server twice for it, who really didn't seem to care about it. She was rude the first time I reminded and said its busy as if she was doing me a favour there. The food was flying to other tables, note worthy to mention they got there after we did. After a wait of  35 mins and we decide to leave,  as it really appeared that it was a waste of time waiting on the food to arrive or get someone to even check on our order. As we get off to leave after paying for a drink, the lady who was serving us comes out with the food and shows it to us saying it was only 35 mins, we have a timer in the back and again in a very rude tone. Surely this place could use a little training there."}
{"text":"If I could give it a half star I would terrible service and long wait. I was told it would take 15 minutes but it took closer to 40.    The food was good but not worth the wait or the price."}
{"text":"I am not sure but I think their rib tastes different from the one that I had at Brampton. It was more delicious. Should take a reservation if you are going on weekends. We waited for like 15 minutes before we are seated. Service is fine, the lady is helpful and fast. Washroom should be cleaned more."}
{"text":"Did you know that you can draw on the table? Montana's provide crayons so you can let your imagination run freely.  My girlfriend and I wanted to try a new eatery and I pulled out the good ol' trusty Yelp app to see what's close by that we haven't been to yet and before you know it Montana's was the first to pop up, we haven't been steakhouse so might as well.  Montana's was really busy and was understaffed, the hostess said it would take around 25-35 minutes so we didn't mind waiting. My girlfriend had been here before so when she told me that you could draw on the table I didn't believe her since I thought it would be for kids. But to my surprise it's not a colouring placemat for kids to doodle on but a big brown parchment that anyone can express their inner artist.  My girlfriend and I placed our orders and began playing tic-tac-toe on the parchment. From there we played a few rounds then a round of SOS and finally Connect 4 before decided to draw each other and a mirrored image.  Service took a while and yes while Montana's was pretty busy our server didn't care as much, he gave off the \"I don't want to be here\" mentality. He was one of the unlucky ones who had to work while his other coworkers decided to play hooky because it was a nice weather out.  To start my girlfriend ordered the double-dusted chicken wings while I ordered KAPOW! Surf n turf bites. The wings looked really odd, it wasn't breaded or straight fried more like seasoned a few times then fried. While the surf n turf was pretty interesting although I don't understand the meaning behind their \"kapow\" because my appetizer didn't packed a punch but nevertheless it was good.   When the entrées came around that's when things stated to change. My lady ordered the smoky chicken \"parm\" while I had the 10 oz steak cooked medium. The \"parm\" was really bland and was lacking sauce while the steak was really dry on the outside but at least it was tender on the inside. What I don't understand was why the parm was in quotation marks. Was it really parm that they were serving or an inspiration dish? You'll never know.  Despite the fact that Montana's was really busy they still manage to pull it through. It's a definite +1 in my books and we will return back soon! Maybe for lunch or dinner again but who knows."}
{"text":"Miles better than Kelsey's but not half as good as Milestones. Passable if not bland fare, with average service."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with the family Sunday night and it was a toss up between here, Kelsey's and Milestones. My daughter ended up picking Montana's so off we went.  We've been to all three before but I'll have to say that while the service was exceptional, the food fell short of the mark.  Stay away from the Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding and mash with gravy and vegetables. It sounds delicious but it is in fact the opposite of that.  The only thing that would bring me back once more is the service. Ayla was great and the manager Victor was equal to his task."}
{"text":"Nothing special about their food  The steak sandwich is actually horrible  The meat was so hard to chew . And there is not too many options on the menu . I only give it 2 stars"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a lot (since it opened). The kids love this place -  Adults not so much. The prices have gradually creeped up to something i would describe as lacking in value, and the service is hit or miss. Some nights service is  great - tonite it was not, but the server was new (we have had 'new' servers in the past and have had a number of poor ones). The serving staff made errors on 2 sides, and one entree was incorrect twice (yes - the same diner received TWO wrong orders - by the time one of the kids (a 9 year old) got his food the rest of us were done (we tried to assemble him a meal from the rest of our plates so he wouldn't go hungry) - this is a GIANT faux pas to make for a child diner.   Normally I am completely okay with a wrong side coming out because they are normally fixed FAST - this time they were not (took maybe 8 minutes; long enough so the side was more like desert since the rest of the meal was done...)  . The reason they have a 'revolving door' of servers is that cara restaurants often use a claw back on tips (i.e. the 'house' keeps a portion of the tip) - not many servers put up with that for long.   Anyways on to the food - tonite i had a 1/4 rack ribs (i.e. 3 bones) and some brisket. The brisket is nothing special anymore (It almost tasted like 'boil in a bag' stuff) - and the ribs were TINY. I wish I took a pic of the ribs - I even pointed it out to the server and manager - but they claimed it was regular size (i've had the ribs before, and they were larger in the past - maybe its a new sizing thing - I kind of suspect I just managed to get a weird cut that was on the smaller side or something ). Its possible the rib thing was a one off so I'm not going to hold it against them - but it just helped to add up to me wondering how this place stays around.  so - tonite there was pretty crummy service. Food that was below the norm (and by 'norm' i mean the norm for cara food - which is average)  Am I bellyaching a lot? yes. But I noticed the number of stellar reviews on here and wanted to balance them out with this review. As I said : I have had much better meals at this location - but its possible to get a real stinker too. My party decided we are probably going to try to avoid this place in the future - but since the kids love it we might have to cave in once in a while."}
{"text":"We were a group of six for dinner. Our waiter was very nice and efficient. When our food was brought, that's when almost everything went wrong. All five orders, with the exception of mine were  incorrect, I went with a hamburger, which was really good. My wife ordered the cookhouse top sirloin [medium well] with baked potato. Her steak came medium rare to medium, and got one of our friend's baked potato with bacon bits, but did not get her crispy onions. One of our friends ordered the Honkin' beef ribs with cracked black perpercorn bbq sauce. There wasn't any peppercorn. Another friend is an Executive Chef. He ordered the cookhouse top sirloin steak also [medium]. It was well done, over-cooked. He was annoyed and did not eat it. Another friend ordered the Honkin' beef ribs with honey garlic sauce, she said it didn't taste like it. Unfortunately, I don't remember what our other friend had.  The mishaps were shared with our waiter. He apologized, went to speak with the manager, who came to speak with my friends. He apologized, went to speak with the cook. When he returned, he told the lady that ordered the  Honkin' beef ribs with cracked black perpercorn bbq sauce that the cook said it is the black cracked peppercorn bbq sauce. My friend insisted there isn't as they would be visible. The same was with our friend that order her beef ribs with honey garlic sauce.  It was getting late, and after so many mistakes, the orders were not sent back to be re-done. I was the only one that finished my meal.  The manager did not offer any type of compensation. The bill was paid. We felt really bad for our waiter because he gave really  good service and was far more apologetic than the manager, but we understood that his hands were tied. Our waiter got more than the standard 15% gratuity.  We would not return to this Montana's.   I hope this review is helpful.  God bless,  Mardy W. Dixon"}
{"text":"Ah Montana's. Once upon a time (see: 2002) your rustic* (*tacky) ambiance and moderately priced selections (and God love you, the paper tablecloth and various crayons) provided a viable and even desirable option for a Saturday night meal.   Flash forward ten years. Having abstained from Montana's for reasons as unimportant as they are unknown, and having never visited the Beacon Hill location, I was unsure of exactly what to expect. While the Fargo truck embedded in the ceiling didn't let me down, and the service was attentive but not smothering, our small sampling of the menu was decidedly mediocre. My buffalo chicken sandwich, always a great fallback option when entering a new domain and somewhat unsure of the menu, featured a sauce that tasted vaguely of burnt plastic. Luckily, my lady-friend's chicken tacos (...) were more enjoyable, although be warned that if you are inexplicably anticipating a sauce that is more spicy than sweet, you are in for a bit of a surprise. Highlight of the night goes to the self-coined Ron Swanson special enjoyed by the brother-in-law, featuring a quarter chicken and rack of ribs done nearly to succulent perfection. Meat with a side of meat. I grew additional chest hair just writing about it.  All in all, if you dig antlers and feel like revisiting Gaston's tavern without actually watching Beauty and the Beast, Montana's may have a certain vibe that you can jive to...or maybe not. At the very least, I would imagine the kids will enjoy it. Lastly, if this small sampling was any indication, you may experience a very noticeable disparity in quality between menu items, so choose wisely.   Happy eating."}
{"text":"BUG FOUND IN DRINK:  Was there for dinner, early on a tuesday night so it was slow - our table was filthy and sticky when we were seated.  Needed to have the waiter bring a cloth to clean the table.  My friend ordered a fountain pop and on her first sip, sucked a fairly large beetle up from the bottom of the cup into her mouth.  It looked like it had been dead for a while.  Needless to say we didn't stick around to see what surprises dinner would bring."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday after leaving Denny's on 114th quite annoyed with their lack of service (will be reviewed in detail soon!). We were greeted promptly and sat ourselves in the lounge so my spouse could watch the hockey game.  The server/bartender got us menus and our drink orders almost immediately after we sat down. I was craving a burger and fries and ordered the Chipotle Firecracker Burger with fries and gravy.  We also had some starter wings.   The food came promptly and tasted fresh. The wings at Montana's is pretty tasty and always consistent. The burger was not spicy at all as its name might imply, a little on the sweet side actually, to my slight disappointment, but it was juicy and flavorful. The fries was hot and crisp and the gravy was nothing special.  All in all, I thought Montana's was pretty good and a reliable place to go for good food & good service."}
{"text":"There's not a no stars option. It took 15 min alone to get drinks and was given 4oz glass of wine instead of 8oz. The glass was wet like someone had already had a drink. Another 20 min I got my food that was overcooked/reheated and had massive amounts of salt poured into it. The portion size for corn bread and sides was ridiculously small. The service overall was terrible and slow, food horrible and management completely unconcerned. Couldn't care less. I will never  return to this establishment, I suggest you venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like it here it's a good family restaurant. They always are friendly and polite to us. Although the odd time we have gone there it can be a bit slow and a struggle to get the bill. But the food is pretty good and my son enjoys the kids meals. It's a far better option then Boston pizza which excels in mediocrity"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a reasonable sit down supper on our way home a couple nights ago. Usually Montana's serves a decent and reasonably priced supper but this location failed miserably.   Service: 1 star (our waiter was MIA most of the night) Ambiance: 2 star (typical Montana's casual setting) Cleanliness:  3 star (appeared to be clean) Food: 1 star (fish & chips were crap, manager should be embarrassed the kitchen serve's this food, maybe the waiter was and that's why we only saw him three times, once to order, once when he served the food & drinks, and finally once to deliver the check, he never did ask how the food was.) Price: 1 star (because food & service were so poor)"}
{"text":"We used to go there about once a month. It was our favorite place for ribs. Ever since the new management started \"improving\" the menu, as we were told, everything started going down. From the quality of the food to the atmosphere of the place.   I don't know why some people feel obligated to leave their mark regardless of the cost. Don't fix it if it works!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived about 10:30 pm. We were promptly seated at a table... and then left alone for half an hour. There were two waitresses cleaning tables around us the entire time, avoiding eye contact. We never even got waters. At 11pm we were tired of waiting so we went next door to Boston pizza where we were promptly served.   I understand that sometimes you're understaffed in the evening, but half an hour and not even a water?"}
{"text":"I use to love this location but their service and food has become terrible. When my parents were in town i decided to take them to my favorite restaurant, Montana's, for dinner. It ended up being the most embarrassing and disappointing restaurant experience ever. It took them almost an hour to prepare our food while everyone around us (including the people who came after us) were served before us. When our food did arrive, it was cold and burnt. We didnt understand why it took so long since there were only 4 of us and the waitress didnt give an explanation or apologize. I will never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Asked for a well done steak for take out, got a piece of burned charcoal. For being a steakhouse they sure don't know much about grilling a piece of steak."}
{"text":"Tonight I had poutine. It was delicious. I heard Bare Naked Ladies on the radio. I drank a Canadian. So I feel safe in saying that the only thing that would complete this ultimate night in Canada would be to return to the hotel and catch an episode of either Corner Gas or Trailer Park Boys."}
{"text":"Our office comes here for lunch once in awhile and we always love the food and service. The food is your standard Montana's fare but consistently of good quality. Even with a party of 14 with a half an hour lunch, they are quick to take our orders, serve us and cash us out. The staff here are also very friendly."}
{"text":"Have been to Montana's on the Queensway several times. Was mostly happy with the food & service. However, the last time we went last Sun. Father's Day service was terrible. Our reservations were for 2 pm. We were seated promptly & ordered our food about 2.15 pm. The food arrived at 10 mins. after 3! We waited almost 1 hr. for food to arrive. In addition, there was an exceptionally long wait for drinks, dessert & refills after they were ordered. Plus, unfortunately the baked beans & chicken entrees were dry & cold.  Not sure if we will go back. The restaurant was busy that w/e & the staff were pleasant enough but service terrible. If you have a few hours to kill on a w/e maybe you should pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"Recently I had visited this Montana's location twice over 3 days. The first time with my family and the second time with my friends.  Now don't get me wrong, I have been to a number of Montana location and my experience at the other locations has always been very good. I just would not recommend this location. I don't believe that it is the serving staff, if the rating was only based on them it would be higher. There is something truly wrong with the kitchen and ultimately the management of this Montana's location. How can the quality of food be so different from the other locations that my family I have experienced? If you live in the NW and want a good Montana's experience go to the Crowfoot location, the difference is night and day. If the off chance the Montana corporation reads this post, you guys have major problems at this location and it needs fixing."}
{"text":"Meal came out nothing like it was described on the menu. I have had this dish before at other locations & it was delicious! Although tonight it  Looked like someone's leftovers were piled on my plate, very disappointing !   The washrooms are horrible, you can smell them 20 feet outside the bathroom doors!   Staying away from this location from now on..."}
{"text":"Came to this location a few times, and they have amazing service and food. The waiters are quick and super friendly (and good looking). The service is fast as well, we got the food pretty quick. Definetly try their spinach dip appetizer, its amazing ! I am not a nacho fan, but really enjoyed their pulled pork nachos! Their entrèes are not to die for, but they were tasty :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced! If you ever want to get served or evem greeted at the door don't come here. Came here with my son to eat lunch and waited at the front for 10mins and no one greeted us so we sat ourselves....waited another 5mins still no one came to us.  Funny thing is met a couple who was waiting 15mins and the guy had to go find his own menus!! Just got up and left.  Never go to this place."}
{"text":"For a chain, this one's actually good. The double-chicken breast dinner is terrific by any standard. The veggies taste as good and fresh as any I've ever had and the garlic mashed potatoes are delicious. My trick, if it's crowded, is to walk past the people lined up at the door and into the bar section. Once there, the idea is to scan around and see who is close to finishing. When they pay the bill and get up, you walk over calmly -- and this is important, you don't want to make anyone nervous -- and slide into their still-warm seat. The people at the door who are still waiting for a table in the \"family dining\" section will look at you in bewilderment. This is their problem. You must understand you've done nothing wrong. That's how it works there and if those suckers want to wait for the \"ambience\" of screaming children while they dine, they deserve to wait for 45 minutes. You'll already be gone by the time they get a table. If nobody in the bar section appears to be ready to leave, sit at the bar and have a drink. If you're in a hurry, they'll serve your meal there."}
{"text":"Service was great and the drinks were cold. Food was OK, somewhat taste less for chicken and ribs considering the price"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has several bad reviews. We came here around 8 on a Wednesday. Great service! We had two waiters taking care of us and there were many busy tables including two birthdays. All you can eat ribs with your choices of sauce and side dishes for $32! What a deal ! All of the food was served hot with authentic barbecue flavor. Great place. Definitely worth a visit if your in that area."}
{"text":"I came here and ordered the all you can eat fajitas.  I started my order at 5:30 on a Tuesday, not a busy time at all.  I only received one full order of fajitas by 7:00.  They brought out extra meet for the fajitas but no shells or other toppings.  The service was terrible as I had to find my server to ask for basics such as ketchup and refills.  I love Montana's but will never come back to this location, even though I live 3 minutes away."}
{"text":"Montana's is the kind of restaurant that I've been to numerous times in the past but keep coming back to. Over the years, they've updated the menu, and I have to say, I'm quite impressed by the new changes. The decor is still the same, woodsy, mountain man-ish, deer heads mounted on the wall and wooden log tables, but it has a certain charm to it.  We ordered the pulled pork nachos for our appetizer and although I'm not the biggest fan of pulled pork, I was still pleased by the taste. The salsa was mildly spicy, the pulled pork bits, juicy.  I ordered the Big Momma's lemonade, a drink that was just fantastic. My husband ordered the Classic Caesar, and both were served in jam jars which I thought was a cute, rustic touch.  For our main meal, I had the Chicken soft tacos with option of a side Caesar salad, and my husband had the Peppercorn fire grilled Top Sirloin with a side salad as well. He enjoyed his steak overall but felt that the salad was a bit bland. My chicken tacos were quite good, with a zesty sauce drizzled over them.   Our waitress was friendly, knowledgable, and prompt.  Seeing as the menu has been updated, I'm far more interested in returning sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Food was good ,service was none existent .....for the first time ever left no tip....."}
{"text":"Ribs tasted like old meat... beans were DISGUSTING and thick, potatos were definitely from a bucket, and my corn bread was literally falling apart.   First time I've never finished all of my meal eating out.    WHAT happened to Montanas?  I remember they used to be pretty decent and I used to LOVE their Ribs and Wings... they changed heaps since the last time I went, and I'm not impressed with it.  Won't go again."}
{"text":"Awful greasy food. Put too much oil on my food than necessary, and best of all, I found hair in my food. Do not come here."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed having lunch and dinner here.  The place is clean with a nice friendly staff. The restaurant is usually busy, country music playing in the background and the specials are great to.   I like the beef ribs with the JD sauce. The meat just falls off the bones. Really large portions and free refills on drinks. It's a great place to take your family or kids, especially when you have a Birthday to celebrate."}
{"text":"I go here a lot with my family and generally speaking we have an amazing experience.   In terms of food, practically everything on the menu is amazing. I love the Canadian Burger, Eh because its just a perfect blend of flavor. I`m also a fan of their chicken tacos and the quesedillas. Desert is always delicious and the skillet cookie is to die for.   My mom always has the fajitas and she swears by them so I take it those are delicious too.   I would NOT recommend the kapow shrimp. We had it once and it was really dry and tasteless, we didn't really enjoy it.   The only problem with this location is the service and the speed. Depending on when you come, it seems like the busier it is the more likely you are to be served. We came once for lunch and it took almost 40 minutes for our food to get there, and the restaurant was practically empty!   As well, we went recently and our server was kind of detached and rude.   However, i would definetly recommend you go there, even if it is just for the food. The atmosphere is friendly and cozy. :)"}
{"text":"Bland bland bland. Came inside one of the servers saw me and ignored me for a 10 mins. Then host finally came after forever and took 5 more minuets to seat us. Ones we were all seated we got the menus and began to order. Food arrived and the mashed potatoes were the most nastiest texture of potatoes I've ever eaten. They were watery and bland. Wings aren't that great either even if they were half off not worth it. The fish and chips tastes frozen and rubbery filled with grease. I could of just went to the store and gotten frozen fish and chips and toast it better then spend $17 on it here."}
{"text":"As we arrived for lunch, we were greeted and seated right away. Our server came in a reasonable time. Very friendly and informative. I started with drinks, by his suggestion I tried the Spiced Hazelnut Banana Milkshake which came a but messy but I enjoyed very much. Our drinks took about 10-15 minutes to arrive.  We then placed our orders, steak and a burger, with sides of course. Although it took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive, there were a few thing we'd adjust about our meals but still good meals. Other than the one our utensils were wrapped in, there we no serviettes or wet towels.  Our server was very kind, friendly, and appreciative of our tip."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place after it became a franchise. We had the rude hostess who just left the menu's on the table and than left. After waiting a VERY LONG time. Our server came and she was complaining of how it's near the end of her shift while we were trying to make conversation since we know how it feels cause all of us were servers. There was another girl who took our drink orders and she was obviously awkward and rude. She just kept starring at us like we were crazy. After we had another girl server approach us right after our food came out and said and I quote \" can you like just pay so she can finish her shift and like I'll take care of you. Can you like just pay now so she can leave.\" Also might I add our \"server\" wasn't there when she stated this. Funny thing was we were confused as to who our server was cause their were 3 different girls who approached our table. We agreed so she could leave and she gave us our bills and waited their watching us pull out our money. I didn't even want her to give me change she was rushing us and I just gave her a 40 dollars on a 30 dollar bill. Never have I had such horrible and rude service. I've worked at the other montanas and this would have never slide at my workplace. Not to mention our food was cold and disgusting. Will never come back to this place. I used to come all the time before it got brought out and I knew majority of the servers who worked there  and they were fantastic. I am so disappointed on the new crappy staff they hired."}
{"text":"Service efficient but hurried not a place to relax. I had mexican chicken done with tacos very tastless, my wife had Ribs, very tough. maybe try the place again in a couple of years!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch during the week. The restaurant had only 3 other tables our food took over 45 minutes to arrive only to come out cold and dried out. The server took the steak sandwich back to the kitchen to recook, with no visit from a supervisor or manager. Upon receiving the bill I inquired if the manager had been notified about the situation, the server replied \"yes, but she wasn't interested in rectifying the situation\". Server said that the management was indifferent to the operations of the restaurant. All around a very poor experience."}
{"text":"This is the alternate dining and drinking location to the Kelsey's next door. No pretentious sayings in neon bulbs, and none of that loud music either. You can actually hear yourself talk and think.   Service is always great IMHO. If you want the best of the best - Sal and Maeghan in the bar area never disappoint, and Melanie in the dining room is fantastic.   Food-wise ... The ribs are the signature dish and every day of the week they have an all you can eat special. They also have half price wings on Mondays - and the wings are fantastic. I also HIGHLY recommend the Antojitos and the Kapow Shrimp.   Full line of beverages and decent speed of service - it's a great \"before the movies\" dinner or \"after the movies\" drink given the proximity to the Queensway Ciniplex Theatres.   So go in - enjoy some corn bread and ribs - and tell them \"Montréal Iain\" sent you!"}
{"text":"Food is good and very tasty however our Server (Keira) was exceptionally rude from we arrived, if she doesnt like her job she really shouldnt b dealing with the public, im a server myself and her attitude was stinking!!!! Would put me off going back!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here a few times. Mixed feelings about this location. I've had awesome service here but also really horrible service as well. However, let's talk about the experience I had recently. We went here because we haven't been in a long time and thought, why not!  We were greeted immediately with a smile. Brought to a booth and our server was with us within a few minutes. So far so good! =)  I ordered a steak with mash potatoes with gravy and corn and my friend ordered half-rack of ribs with a fully loaded baked potato and corn on the side. When our dishes came to our table, they looked good. (but it could have possibly been that I was super hungry at that moment) I had ordered my steak medium rare and I have to say they cooked it just the way I asked! I was very pleased with that. With that being said, the steak was huge with beautiful grill marks but it was chewy. The flavor was just not there. The mashed potatoes were mediocre at best. Only part of my meal that I enjoyed was the corn and also the corn bread that I stole off my friend's plate. (lol)  The service was great. Never had to ask for a refill, they just kept on coming when needed. Took a bit of time for us to get the bill though...  Overall, not a GREAT place to eat but it will do the trick if you're hungry enough. I know that they have AYCE RIBS every day now instead of just Wednesdays. I've been hearing good things from a few friends about that...might give it a go if I can get someone brave enough to do it with me!"}
{"text":"I've been to the crowfoot Montana's for all you can eat ribs around 3 times.  The pass few times were pretty good. it was WAY better than Tony Roma's.  So I decided to go with my family the pass Wednesday around 730.  Wasn't too busy, only waited about 5 - 10 minutes and we got a booth (for 5). A little after we got seated, the waitress (mika) came over and asked for our drinks.  We all ordered all you can eat ribs.  Around an hour after our order was placed, it FINALLY came.   My mummie was already really angry cause she only came once on the 30 minute mark to talk to us about our order.  After she placed our ribs down, we had no utensils what so ever.  And she doesn't refill our drinks for us UNLESS we ask for one.  She only checked on us 2-3 times throughout our whole meal.  The first set of ribs were pretty good. but David's were a little burnt on the bottom.  For the second set of ribs, they were all a little burnt on the bottom.  On the third set, it was fatty meat and ALL burnt.  We told her about it and replaced another order for us, but it was just as burnt.   When we left, she didn't even say bye or thank you what so ever.  Honest to god, if i was the one that paid the bill, i wouldn't have even tipped her, daddie's too nice &gt;=T  This trip to Montana's was quite disappointing.. I don't think I'm gonna be going back to the Crowfoot Montana's for quite a while.  They're going way downhill.  price wise(the more $, the more expensive): $$$  food quality(1 is the lowest and 5 is he highest): 3  services wise(1 is the lowest and 5 is he highest): 1"}
{"text":"Quality is way down. Service was slow and salads not fresh. Disappointed!   I would not return, and I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"This Montana doesn't open till midnight. The operating hours on Maps is incorrect, best to call in case hours are seasonal.     Food was alright but their sides are slightly seasoned differently than the location at Islington and Queensway.     Other than that, service is good and consistent with other chains!"}
{"text":"I have been there 3x in 2 weeks. I love it!  I get the beef rib dinner with veggies and corn. The cornbread is out of this world. I love how we get to paper to entertain ourselves with while we wait."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Our waitress was impatient, rude and short with us. I think her name was Ashley.  We asked to speak to the manager (Nicky), who did acknowledge our concerns, however, after that, we got blacklisted by all the service.. I think that our original server was complaining to the other staff and we couldn't even get a glass of water after that. We get the opportunity to go out for dinner as a family, about once a month. It is a treat for us. We were so disappointed by the evening...even our young children were upset. I can forgive bad food before I would forgive bad service. In this case, I would have to forgive both before I ever go back to this place for a meal. It was a first and a last for us. And I have to say, If the servers here are bored or sick of their job, perhaps they should step down and let someone else do it. There are many people hungry for work right now. I still have a hard time understanding why these big companies have such poor service and food. The whole vibe of this as a business, seems very complacent. And to that server I would say, take a little pride In What you do."}
{"text":"Usually my favourite restaurant. Fiance and I have been coming here for a few years as we live down the street. They recently renovated the place and hired some new waitstaff and it's gone completely downhill. Our one bartender was shockingly rude. Somehow at 8pm on a Monday they had run out of redbull and straws. Not sure how a bar can run out of straws?  After half an hour a group of pretty young looking teenagers sat near us and ordered some drinks without being carded once. This on top of the FIFTEEN minute wait for our drinks just ruined the place for me"}
{"text":"Just a great place to grab a beer, eat meat and watch some sports. Food is consistent most of the time. If my family is having a tough time deciding on where to go, we always end up at Montana's."}
{"text":"I go here quite regularly on Saturdays to have a bite and watch some of the hockey game.  The steak at around $20 is one of the best values going. Would rather pay them than the Keg. The regular Saturday bartender is friendly and provides great service. The salad with the lemon garlic dressing is excellent.   Typical Montana's decor. I have never sat outside the bar area so can't comment on the rest."}
{"text":"Party of 10 and service was awful. Waiting over an hour for our cold food and and another twenty for them to warm it up. Overall an awful experience and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife, her meal came after quite a long wait (others seated after us were already eating) while mine arrived even later. Medium cooked steak arrived rare and it was accompanied by burnt, cold shrimp skewer. Staff was helpful & friendly. Maybe stick to beverages and appetizers here."}
{"text":"Today's experience was unreal. Got there after a movie, was told a 25 minute wait....which was no problem.... It's understandable for a Saturday evening. Got a table.....waited for about 10 minutes before a waitress came over.....and just as I was about to give her the drink order she announced that the restaurant was out of ribs.....I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITH \"WE WERE THERE FOR THE ADVERTISED ALL YOU CAN EAT RIBS\" ... the waitress proceeded to tell us that the group of 10 that was sitting beside us have all ordered the all you can eat ribs and that as a result they were out. UNREAL....how can a chain restaurant that is actively advertises something like \"all you can eat\" be out so early in the evening.... I guess poor management and planning... the waitress apologized but that was it... No \"here's a discount for next time\" or any other kind of compensation for their screw up....believe me, it's the last time visiting this location."}
{"text":"Hate being negative but just got back from this place. I had my two year old and pregnant wife and let's just say the service was horrible!! Waited 45min for our food and the entire time no one checked to see if we had cutlery or milk for my little guy. Even after we asked the hostess who was the only one I could find twice no one came. When the food came it was so cold that the food looked as if it was left out for soo long. Spoke to the manager who took it back and warmed it up but it was still crappy! Nothing like old steak..I have to say she took one dish off the bill but I could not justify a tip as we paid for food we did not touch. Never go back especially my son got shafted too!! Not cool at all!! Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Bad service, slow and miss orders.  Not able to remember the items ordered.  Not reccomended."}
{"text":"Skip the steak, skip this location. 10 minutes before server arrived. 3 people and thought we would all try their steak. 1 meal not hot, 2nd meal meat over cooked so server didn't bother bringing it and ordered a new meal. 3rd meal moderately warm and meat was well done not medium well. No offer to remove reordered meal free despite the replacement coming 10 minutes later. Server appeared too busy, was not attentive and took 3 trips to complete meal payment. Wouldn't recommend steak and maybe they were short staffed but will skip this location in future."}
{"text":"It's not the best place to eat but the service is quick the staff is very friendly and the kids love that their meal comes in a truck and dessert is three ice cream cones and gummie worms. :)"}
{"text":"I don't go to Montana's often, as they don't really cater to any of my particular cravings. The food here is ok, more than anything. They serve a small assortment of burgers, pastas, chicken dishes, etc - a general hodgepodge of meals that you could find the equivalent to at a handful of other restaurants for about the same price. I'm never particularly wowed by anything on the menu; there isn't anything that makes me think \"I have to try that!\", but generally what we do order is tasty and satisfying at the time. I do recommend the Honey Apple Cobbler (om nom nom).   The thing I love about Montana's is the paper tablecloths and mug of crayons available at every booth and table. What can I say - I'm a sucker for gimmicks and anything that gives me an excuse to color on random surfaces. While this doesn't really lend to a classy dinner date (whatever, you're at Montana's), it is a fun sort of distraction, giggling as you try to determine if your companion has drawn a lima bean or an airship."}
{"text":"We went to the Montana NE recently after a hard day of moving for my friend, it was 7pm when we went in, some empty tables still didn't take us long to sit down, the waitress took more than 10 min to take our orders for drinks, and it took her more than 20 min to get us our drinks, by the time drinks came the guy rented the moving truck told her we need to leave soon so please take our orders, she said ok just need to go put her trays down, and that's another 15 min.  By the time we ordered our food it's already 45-50 min since stting down, the guy needed to leave by 9pm to retun the the truck so he mentioned again to the server after ordering the food.  Then we wait, she didnt' come back since, we waited for another 30-40 min at least, if the food take awhile to prepare, at least come back and fill up our drinks, but nothing, she's nowhere to be found, by 8:50pm the guy got up and found one the the servers (not ours) that he needed to go, can't wait for the food anymore since it's been almost 2 hours and the food still not arrive, just then the food came. And the food was cold, plates were cold, I ordered steak salad medium rare, and the steak was cold and well done, my friend ordered chicken fingers and fries and they were cold too. we were all very hungry and pissed, four of us got up and left didn't even touch our food, we sent them back.  It was very unpleasant and a huge waste of time!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience at Montanas, altho I'm never overly impressed, this place takes the cake. We only went because we were traveling through Calgary and it was my sons 3rd birthday so the song and dessert sounded fun.....3.5 hours(alot of waiting)  3 waitresses, (apparently stealing each other's tables) a pile of confusion we finally got out of there.  Not before asking 4 times to have my son sang too. Furious. Get your crap together.. better management needed."}
{"text":"The server was slow and we got the food cold  too well done we couldn't cut through it. Overall BAD experience, when we were ready to pay we thought that the server went to get the debit machine but she started cleaning other tables and left us sitting there, i was so upset it was a school night and we needed to get home. Never going there again!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is My favorite guilty pleasure , I absolute love the fajitas and the anajitos (not quite sure on my spelling) . Its worlds better than Kelsey's or jack Astors in my opinion. Great for families or people who are looking to have some drinks . I've been a bunch of times and I will for sure be going back again."}
{"text":"The service was decent.  Food was alright.. I don't think i'll be back though"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Food is always great, place is clean and service is decent (more so on the slower side).  antojitos are amazing! Big mamas lemonade tastes like a lemonade, so whether or not there's even alcohol is debatable. Ribs are good, burgers here are amazing and pastas are average. Steak is also good here too, but the usual chain restaurant type of good."}
{"text":"We always go here when in town for business.  Our favorite is the all you can eat rib night.  We thought it was odd there were only a few tables occupied.  Only two people were waiting tables on Wednesday night two weeks ago.    The ribs were great as usual, but the service was horrible.  We did not get all you can eat since it took forever to get a rib refill.  The waiter kept disappearing, and even left the credit card machine at the table.  We had to leave without signing, but went back when a waitress came out at the last minute.  The next trip we will b trying some new places.  Maybe we will try again if they get new management."}
{"text":"Yuck. I got out of a late movie and was craving some nachos. I hadn't been to Montana's in over 3 years and it's not my #1 choice. But it was close by, so we decided to just go there. It was a Thursday evening, so the restaurant was only a quarter full and we were sat pretty quickly. The menu said that the only nachos they had were \"Pulled Pork Nachos\". I like pulled pork, so I decide to settle for those even though I wanted just plain nachos. We also decided on a caesar salad to share and deep fried pickles. We promptly put in our order, and that was probably the most service we received all night. We saw several staff members walking around, chatting and ignoring customers. It seems to me that Montana's tends to hire really young servers (barely 18 I think) that don't give a crap about their job.  The food took almost 40 minutes to arrive. The starter caesar salad was pretty disappointing. It was extremely small (small even for a starter), and looked like that bagged iceberg lettuce from Safeway with bacon bits and Renee's Caesar Salad Dressing. I could make that at home, and do a way better job too. The deep fried pickles were alright, but the batter was a bit thick. The worst was the Pulled Pork Nachos. There was barely any cheese on the nachos, and it wasn't even melted cheese. The pulled pork was disgustingly sweet, almost like they were sitting in maple syrup for a week. It made the nachos taste awful.  I tried to flag down the server, but had no luck. So, unfortunately, I was so hungry that I ate around the horrible pulled pork as best I could. That was the theme of the service all night. As soon as we placed our order, we didn't see our server again until we were done eating. Our drinks had been sitting empty for a while, and she asked if we wanted more drinks as she was bringing over our bill. Since I work in the service industry, I still tipped her, though not nearly as much as I usually do because of her nonexistent service. Not recommended, unless you want slow service and terrible food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for years now and this was the worst experience at this location, the waitress Marza or Marcia was a horrible waitress 100$ check and I wish I had stayed home. She was rude and and extremely unprofessional, I hope her manager reads this and they change how they treat their customers. If I ever come back it's because the location is convenient, but it was so bad I don't see myself returning. I payed for the waitress to spill 1/4 of a pitcher of sangria on the table and on the floor by my shoes, she didn't apologize just stated that she hadn't poured from a pitcher into glasses before. She did not bother cleaning up after her mess and decided to sit down in the booth beside me while she coated the table and floor beneath my feet with sangria. She did not check in to see if we needed anything else I, I had to take my meal to go cause I had no water. She was rude and had a dismissing attitude towards my sister and myself. She most certainly ruined my dinner. If she can't handle her job she simply shouldn't have it."}
{"text":"No matter the food quality, service is terrible. I'm one of two at the bar and I have asked to order food 3x over 20 minutes. I hope it's good but it is pricey and I only pay for good food in parallel with good service."}
{"text":"Service is excellent!!! However, food quality is not as good comparing to other locations. Just average."}
{"text":"Really crappy service. Waited 5 minutes to see if we could get seated. Had to leave because they had no host."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner.. feeling the need for some meat that evening.  The place was pretty empty, considering it was a Sunday night, there were 4 tables full only, one of which was a birthday party.  For birthdays, they sing you a song and put on a giant moose hat on the special person.  Anyway, the food was not disappointing.  I had their famous ribs and shrimp combo with Apple sauce (recommendations of my waiter which turned out great!).  The ribs were grilled crispy outside, sealing the juicy meat inside.  My side of sweet potato fries was amazingg :)"}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation and couldn't have been more pleased.  To start, their ribs are insane.  Tons of food and 'fall off the bone' quality.  GREAT ribs...haven't had ribs like that in a while.  Great local beer as well.  And, to top things off the staff there was hot as sh&$  Good beer, babes and food.  Can't go wrong.    Can't wait to go back through Toronto."}
{"text":"This doesn't even deserve one star. Terrible service, sub pare food. Extremely unfriendly staff. The server was just standing looking at her phone the whole time I was there.  Staying in the hotel across the street I thought it would be a nice change. Boy was I wrong. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"The service here is quite slow. Even when the restaurant is nearly empty, we wait quite a while for our food to come out. Nonetheless, we do enjoy the meals we have here. So if you're willing to wait for your meal, its an adequate place to go grab a bite to eat. Even their vegetarian dishes were delicious! However, if you're in a hurry I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Went to Montana's located by the Queensway movie theatres, wanted to squeeze in a meal before movie. Ordered a chicken caesar wrap(on the 15 minute menu). Advice: don't EVER order any items on the 15-minute menu. Evidently that promise can only be kept if the food is prepped days ahead, lettuce was completely soggy and only fit for the compost bin, instead of some type of caesar dressing there was globs and globs of mass bottled steak sauce.  I felt so unwell after this meal , I needed to beg off on the movie and went home."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place with a great patio so we decided to give Montana's a try. After seeing the menu we were surprised by so many options that they had, including a great variety of appetizers (stuffed potato wedges, wings, fried pickles, dips, nachos, shrimp and etc), as well as mains, which are mostly meat dishes. The ribs seems to be there speciality as they offer them in a few combos and also with different toppings. After going through their large menu we decided to share an appetizer platter and order 2 orders of fajitas (chicken and my fried ordered beef). The platter we had was quite interesting and had goat cheese dip, fried pickles, mini ribs, stuffed potato wedges and fries. Out of all the items on this platte some were a hit and some a total miss. The dip and the fried pickles were quite tasty, while the  other items were so so. The ribs well seasoned but they were cold and dry. The stuffed potatoes looked appealing but did not tease fresh at all. As for the fajitas, the meat on both dishes was quite dry and way over cooked. Also the toppings, were quite bland so we added quite a bit hot sauce for extra flavour.  In terms of portions, they are quite big so there was more than enough food on the table.  This is a great place for casual drinks and appetizers, especially in the summer when you can take advantage of their patio. I would come back for drinks only and would rather have dinner elsewhere. My overall experience was more on the underwhelming side."}
{"text":"I called this location in the afternoon to pick up some lunch. I ordered the fire grilled salmon salad. I've had it at the restaurant and it was great so I ordered it again. Stupid me, I didn't bother checking the food. Came back to my office and firstly, the portion was TINY for $16.99 plus tax. Secondly, the salmon was tiny AND burnt. It honestly was an $8.99 salad (at the most). If it was actually $8.99 I wouldn't really have cared. I'd have picked off the burnt part and happily gone about my day. But it wasn't. It was a $20 salad. I'm afraid to say that this is how they treat customers who pick up and run without checking their food...but I'm sure that it is (based on other things I've heard about this place...).   Needless to say, I'm never ever coming back here, dining in or taking out. I suggest you all do the same. Let's see a respectable restaurant chain take its place!"}
{"text":"We went there one night in Sept/13 and had a wonderful experience. The service was great and there was not a long wait time for food.  I ordered the steak with garlic mashed and cornbread, and my husband ordered the firecracker burger. He said that it was the best burger he had in his life. It did look good. Great meal and our drinks were always full.   We're planning another trip down to the Toronto area in Aug/14, and since we've been craving Montana's ever since our last visit, we will definitely be going again.  Love it there. One of our new favourite restaurants :)"}
{"text":"very nice environment and drawing table. service was good but the salad and steak were not as good as expected."}
{"text":"WORST LOCATION EVER! I'm a huge fan of Montana's, but I gotta admit that my experience at this location has turned me all the way off. It all started when the waitress came and \"tried\" to write her name upside down like all the employees do. She failed miserably and had to write her name facing herself and said \"Sorry it's Friday\". 1. The food took 40 minutes to get to me and it was ICE cold. 2. Complained and it took another 30 minutes for a new dish. How hard its it to make Kapow shrimp?? 3. Was never asked for refills once! 4. 10 minutes into eating my dinner, the waitress put take-out boxes on our table. Does it look like I want to leave? I just got my food.... 5. About 1 minute later, the waitress asked me if I'm paying cash or debit. I told her cash..and she brought the bill. W T F! 6. I decided to leave because the treatment was only getting worse. I mean my friend was dying of thirst and it took her standing on her chair to get someone's attention. 7. We complained about all the mistakes and they offered a free desert. That dessert took 30 minutes!!! why? Because they forgot that they promised it. I was afraid to order water at this point. 8. We paid our bill to the LAST penny, no tips for that moron. She noticed that I didn't tip her and she rolled her eyes and walked off. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"On Friday we stopped by to grab some apps between hockey games at chestwood arena. They were quick and a friendly server. Sat in the bar. Food was fresh and done the way we liked.  I recommend to anyone looking for a place to stop and refill this is a great spot. Washrooms were clean and host was waiting for us at the door. 5 stars because washroom were clean and all supplies were filled, food was correct, all topping we asked for were there when the food arrived. (Extra salsa and sour cream) server was on the ball and it didn't take long for us to pay and get on our way. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Still waiting for my food... Long wait times  We made a reservation and they gave our seats to someone else and said sorry.  There are other bad reviews too online."}
{"text":"We went to Montana's to celebrate my sisters birthday this past Monday.  It was a party of nine.  I had booked a reservation for 6:00 pm.  When I arrived at the restaurant there was no hostess to greet/seat us.  I had to walk around to find someone who new nothing about our reservation.  Our table was not ready and we had to wait.  I only wish this was the worst of the evening.  We promptly gave our order to the waitress, as we were with 2 small children.  Our food took almost an hour and a half to arrive!  During this time, the waitress did not visit our table to let us know what was taking so long.  We could not even find her to refill our drinks.  When the food finally came our steak was not cooked to how we ordered it and another dish was cold.  We asked to speak with the manager, George Skopeleanos, who seemed to care less of the experience we were having.  I will never visit Montana's again, as by the service I received I did not feel like a valued customer.  I actually felt quite the opposite and will make sure I let everyone I know, and every social media site - that it is advisable to stay away from Montana's at 41 Milner Avenue."}
{"text":"The good thing about this local is they cater to people with food sensitivities/ allergies. But, I was not impressed with their portion size and menu costs. Ordered a chicken with fresh veggies. I asked this to spice it up for tastiness and savoriness. It came with mediocre tendencies and too small portions. I ordered a club soda/ cranberry drink. It came in a glass jar like cup ( preserve jar ) ~ 10 oz. - Good size to fill you up and quench any thirst but was $4.95. Total meal ~ $45 ( tip incl. )  Oh they do provide free wifi with your meal.   Fairly clean resto with freshly clean warmed up washrooms and supplies ( but their women's sanitary box out of order. )   My waitress supplied me and I reimbursed her for her kindness even though she initially refused. Wait staff are young attractive & cute fresh face pretty efficient and friendly. Seems all are college or university students or planning to be. The resto has a casual saloon western sports bar theme made w/ huge lumber logs rafters w/ huge screens at the bar.  The bar tableseems to be abit awkward to eat in(made for Caucasians instead of Orientals tiny stature. You wld have to stretch out yr neck over the thk.metal cold railing to get at yr dish to enjoy yr meal. Might be a tad bit uncomfortable).  But, bring your $$$, or go to Wimpy's across at the mall or Congee queen across the street island for a more inexpensive meal.  Happy dining. ExpensivePeppermint Tea costs $2.95+tax ( a box of 20s av. 4:49 devide by 20 = .25+H20 In a cup &refills .50 = sld. be .75cts. Or 1.50 only?!?) On another outing... Ordered a 6oz. Sirloin steak baked potatoe/sour cream chives, mixed fresh veggies( broccoli carrots corn ) Steak was med./welldone-as requested. Baked potatoe was done well. Veggies tasty nicely done.  It was baseball finals for blue jays so was fairly busy so busy that I got there & finally order by 7:45pm.  But, I finally got my forgotten meal at 8:45pm.(constant 2 reminders). Even though initially I asked for it to be packaged for take out, when it finally came I was cold&famished. Uncorked the takeout pack And gulped most of it there on a cold night&didn't want to risk it gettin cold bringing it back home. Costs: $32 with sml tip even for their mistakes & forgetfulness. The couple next to me said I shld not tip for their mistakes. Won't be going too soon again.     Guess what extremely excellent unlogged in(NOPASSWORDrequ.) for WiFi connectivity anywhere within 10-30' of resto vicinity!!! Reason Maybe because of this eatin slurpin fartin aftr yr exp. meal here is so so friggen expensive!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but over-priced.  The service is good, but it would be nice if they took reservations since the wait can be very long.  The atmosphere is casual and noisy."}
{"text":"A First time visitor the wife and I took our son here as a birthday treat , I've got to say we really enjoyed the overall experience and pleasantly surprised  the all you can eat ribs were really nice and service was really great"}
{"text":"My salmon was overlooked, the veggies and rice that accompanied the salmon were cold, the martini I had came in a dirty glass, the coffee I ordered was Coke and the apple cobbler came without ice cream."}
{"text":"I went to this location today for a late lunch/snack after watching Star Wars (great movie!) since it was right across the movie theatre.  Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing special. I ordered nachos to share with my family, and they ordered some dessert. The nachos were fine. The portion was decent. However, they didn't give us much salsa and sour cream; we found ourselves without any salsa and sour cream about halfway through eating the nachos. I am sure though that if I asked for more, they would have given us some without much of a hassle.  So in the end, no major complaints. Server was nice, food was ok, and there was no need to use my lightsaber."}
{"text":"Was there last weekend but have to admit not the best. Starters ok but mains were far from good. Specialty is meant to be ribs but my son and I had those with the same sauce yet it was like eating 2 different types of food.   Not cheap either and of course the wait to be seated whilst a lot of empty tables just makes you irritated."}
{"text":"Had the \"sirloin\" steak 2 times in the past 3 months. Informed the server / mgr that it is not a \"sirloin\" and both times they were embarrassed and offered a free meal. Km also came out and apologized that they had \"changed the cut.\" I could not digest the 10oz of \"round cut.\" A stewing meet that should be stewed / braised etc. Wife has the vegie burger (that's why we go) and was very happy. But, we wont go back. Lots of other choices for a $80 - $100 meal with the fam."}
{"text":"Yuck - stopped going after too many bad meals. Food is over-priced for mediocre quality and is very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Lots of fun!!  Staff knows how to treat families.  Large portions. Great steaks!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at this location only to find a note on the door that because of Thanksgiving weekend they wouldn't be open until 4pm so we left and came back at 4:10pm  only to find that the doors were still locked and once someone came to the door we were told there was no cook and it would another 30mins before they opened the doors... very disappointed considering I came up from Toronto to meet family their to celebrate my daughters birthday.. I will not be visiting this location  again.. poor service"}
{"text":"I have been to Montanas before. The last time it was 3 stars. This time I had ribs and what a disappointment. Any bbq place that needs to provide a knife with their ribs doesn't have ribs worth eating. Baked potatoe was a bucket of sand. Service was ok."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Montana's in ages but things haven't changed much for the last 10 years. They still do the Moose hat thing for the birthday girl/boy. The food is pretty standard chained restaurant food, a hit or miss depending on what you order.   This location was great as it wasn't very busy on a Sunday evening, so we got the full attention of our server for our large group.   My husband and I ordered the steak fajitas and rack of ribs with chipotle honey sauce, baked beans and a baked potato.  I recommend the ribs as they were fall-off-the-bone goodness. The sides were good but not outstanding.   For the fajitas, I would suggest to eat them quickly as the tortillas got soggy from the condensation inside the container. Not appetizing. I did enjoy the nicely seasoned meat with lots of black pepper. As I took my leftovers to-go, the restaurant was nice enough to give me 4 + tortillas... which made up for the soggy ones I ate earlier.   I would recommend Montana's for a large group or when you want to get your meat fix."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service, there were all of three couples while we were there and it took forever to get the servers attention.  On top of it all, we asked for the bill , which took another 20 minutes for them to bring us the credit card scanner, which turned out to be broken and took another 20 minutes for the server to run around finding other ones only to realize that they are all out of service. Worst experience ever, will never go back."}
{"text":"Avoid this location.  Absolutely terrible.  Ordered the smoked platter, took over an hour to come to table and when it did it was cold and meat was dry. Could not bring myself to eat, sent back. Will never return."}
{"text":"2nd time back to Montanas for lunch in 3 weeks. Everything they've served is delicious, like the pesto chicken. Very kind servers, and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant!  After placing my order and waiting almost 45-60mins I asked the server what's happening to our meal. After the manager came out, I found out that they forgot to place the order."}
{"text":"The visit here was OK.  Everyone was satisfied with their food.  I had a problem though.  I ordered the steak, medium.  It came medium, rare.  I requested it to be done more which left me with my potato to eat until they brought back my steak.  The steak came back, still on the rare side, but could bother sending back as I know it would be ruined.  If I do return to this location I just won't order a steak.  Service was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Remembering I had a voucher for a free appetizer, we decided to head to Montana's for dinner.  Being that it was a Saturday night, I wasn't surprised it was busy so I didn't mind that we got seated on the lounge side. We ordered the 4 cheese spinach dip to start, I got honey garlic wings for my meal and my boyfriend ordered a brisket burger (sirloin burger topped with shredded brisket, cheese and onions).  The dip was very cheesy and tasty, but it was heavy and quite filling - portion wise it's probably meant for more than 2 people to enjoy.   I love the wings at Montana's, they're really meaty and the breading is crispy and holds a lot of sauce. Since I was already full from the dip, I only managed to eat a few wings :(  And my boyfriend liked his burger he only ate half of it since he pretty full too so we ended up boxing up the rest of our food.   I wish we had room for dessert, I've actually tried most of their desserts before (mile high mud pie, apple cobbler and the tortilla cheesecake) and they're all satisfying for a sweet tooth.  We settled our bill (no problems using our voucher) and our waitress informed us to fill out the customer survey noted on our receipt for another voucher. (It literally takes 5 mins, totally worth it!)  Food here is great and so is the service, considering the pretty big portions you get I think it's pretty reasonably priced. And of course, with another voucher in my possession we will definitely check out Montana's in the near future."}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 rack of ribs + sausage combo and boyfriend had the 1/2 rack with chicken wings. I felt that 1/2 rack was too much, should've just got less or got 1/2 rack without the sausage. Sausage had a bit of a kick and was good. Not bad. This will be our go-to when we watch a movie there."}
{"text":"I have to review this place, even I was there months ago. I can't delete from my memory the horrible piece of food that I had there. It was the lowest level you can imagine! Actually, I wanted to call the chief to eat it for me, after I had a bite.  First, I waited too much for a piece of beef to be cooked, the restaurant was empty, no customers.  Second, I did the mistake to order well done beef steak, and it seems that they can't cook anything else than medium rare. I got a piece of charcoal. Uneatable. I mean, even you were totally drunk, you couldn't eat that piece of carbonized beef. The cook had No respect for the meat, it was a disgrace for cuisine art.  The cook should be fire before he kill somebody with his \"cooking style\" and \"experience\"."}
{"text":"Had a family meal here today. My son's pulled pork sandwich, my wife's steak sandwich & my daughter's chicken strips were all above par. I tried the new smoky chicken parm. meal and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not really a fan of smoke but the smoky red pepper cream sauce that topped the linguini was very subtle and the southern fried chicken parm. was quite good. I will definitely have it again. We've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"About to eat at Montana ordered the beef ribs I hope the food taste delicious Montana's has never failed me before. But the only thing is that I wish they had all you can eat ribs with beef ribs for the non pork eater it is amazing deal thought and looks delicious. I will return here again and devour another meal maybe a burger or another signature meal they are promoting"}
{"text":"Such a good restaurant, the staff is very friendly, the food is irresistible and the estuary decor is beautiful and gives you good vibes when you first walk in! I loved my sirloin stake, my hubby loved his chipotle burger! We are on a short visit from the states, and we would definitively stop by again every time we visit!"}
{"text":"The first time I've been to Montana's, I don't recall what I ate but definitely was not impressed with the food and service. However on a recommendation of their chicken poutine from a friend, I went back and absolutely loved it. I also tried the spinach dip which was not the best and the donuts with caramel dip were amazing. Their menu contains a good selection of chicken items, which I'll be going back to try. The only thing here is the service is always slow."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was very slow and server kept forgetting about us and seemed distracted. It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"12 hour smoked beef brisket.. hahaha!   The meat had spots with that shiny iridescent look of cold cuts about to go bad.   I actually think it was just deli sliced roast beef heated up in the microwave.. not fresh cooked in any way.  Dry, no jus, no sauce.  My expectations weren't high but this was just bad.  Beans on the side drowned in sugary ketchupy gunk, flavourless cole slaw.      My wife's medium rare steak had been sliced down the side to check for doneness.. really amateur move at a place supposed to be known for steak.  Not juicy at all.      Bit of an odd interaction with the server when the plates were brought - my brisket (haha! coldcut) plate was missing a cornbread side as advertised on the menu.  When asked, the server said that the problem was, the kitchen would have to cook a fresh one if I want one - pause.. like hoping I wouldn't put them to the trouble of cooking one?  Of course I say, please go ahead and cook a fresh one then.. and when it came out it was not even warm.  They didn't cook it fresh, so were they just hoarding the cornbread hoping no one asks for it?  It was strange.  Server was nice and polite but we were scratching our heads over that."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner with the kids The ribs are great and worth the price  Side orders are a bit pricy for the size they are serving  Overall good food with friendly stuff  Worth the price"}
{"text":"Wow, really cool place.  My wife and I had been wanting to try this place for awhile.  It had a wonderful outdoor feel to the place.  I thought that was funny because the place is so close to the car dealerships lol.    My wife ordered the all you can eat beef ribs and struggled to finish one rib ha ha.  To her defense they were huge! I couldnt stop laughing at the size of them.  Fred flinstones style dinosaur ribs.  Very tender and chargrilled flavor.    I had the pot roast n yorkshire pudding.  I was curious about the yorkshire pudding.  Never tried them before.  I guess it was like a really big cream puff :  ) not bad but I still prefer a good biscuit.  Roast was real tender and the mashed potatoes were wonderful.  I have to say though it didnt have the Wow factor like the beef ribs did.   The service was very good.  A nice waitress named jamie wrote her name upside down on the table for us, not an easy task lol.  Great food and wonderful service.  Its a rib joint.  Get the ribs"}
{"text":"My problem with Montana's is not with the food or the service, but rather with the shady business practices of the owner (who also owns the Oshawa, Whitby and Ajax locations). Servers are required to pay out 3% of their shift sales, under the guise that it will be paid to the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff are then provided with a rule that if there is over 3% food wastage (food sent back, dropped, etc) then they are not entitled to their share of the tips that the servers turn in. The kitchen staff has not received any tips in several years (as less than 3% wastage is unrealistic). What this means is that the owner is keeping all of the money the servers have earned in tips, in addition to company profits. In each store about 20 servers work throughout the day (all of them turning over 3% of their sales - SALES, NOT TIPS - multiply that by 4 restaurant locations, and you can see why perhaps there are so many complaints on here about slow service and slow kitchen service. The staff is being ripped off by the owners rather than being rewarded for providing you with the food and service you deserve. This is a travesty and I would not give this business a dime, no matter how good the steak might be."}
{"text":"What an amazing place to be. My cousins and I were looking for a restaurant to eat at and since I was tired of the usual Chinese or Japanese food, we decided to try Montana's. As we entered we were greeted by one of the waiters who escorted us to our seats.   The menu was definitely a large one, but there are definitely things that may not be on the menu that you certainly should ask for! We found this out because our server was a very knowledgeable person.   Anyway, our starters took at least 10 minutes to come out but the wait was definitely worth it. Our actual mains took a little while longer but the wait was also worth it. The greatest thing about this Montana's is that our server (I don't remember his name unfortunately) was always checking up on us every now and then to make sure we were happy with the service and that we had everything we needed to make our experience the best it could be.   Even after we paid our bill, he then told us it was okay to stay around for a while. I mean honestly, how many restaurants do you go to where service like that exists?!  All I have to say is I had an amazing night filled with amazing food and would not hesitate to go back any time soon. It's worth a check out!   Oh also if Montana's management is reading this... Please find said guy and give him a medal, or something... Because he definitely earned it!"}
{"text":"The steaks were fantastic, but most of the sides were lackluster at best. The server was nice enough but a little unprofessional. She had yelled across the room to another employee just to ask them a question while she was seating us.   I was super excited for dessert because I love the mini-donuts with the caramel sauce. I ordered them and was informed (by the server with NO empathy) that they were out of caramel sauce. I was heartbroken, but I ordered them anyway. I was served some sort of gross fudge sauce in lieu of the caramel and I regret it. My guest ordered a different dessert that also used the caramel sauce and they were equally disappointed. Perhaps the staff should remember to order something important enough to be used in several of their desserts? If I was told before we were even seated that there was no caramel sauce for my dessert after dinner, I probably would have left right away. I went home very sad.  As two grown adults waiting for our dinner, we love drawing on the paper covered table with the provided crayons. It makes the wait more bearable."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the prices are typical. I had the wings and rib combo which was excellent - their wings are seasoned then sauced and the spice is just right.   Going at opening time though is very slow for service and for cooking. I'd come around noon on and it would be better"}
{"text":"Disappointing visit. After a trip to Ikea we drove out of the way to this Montana's and unfortunately it wasn't worth the trip. We were seated immediately and I recall thinking the restaurant didn't seem busy. I ordered the chicken wings from the starter menu and my husband ordered the steak fajitas. The food seemed to take quite a while and when it did come the wings were plain. I was surprised by the missing sauce given the server confirmed my choice twice. When he noticed the mistake he sent them back to be sauced but returned to the table minus the side ranch dip. Not a huge deal, I was hungry and wanted to eat before my meal became even less fresh. For $20 we would have expected the fajitas to come with guacamole. When we our server checked in a while later we requested additional napkins, tortillas and the missing ranch sauce. What seemed like a while later another employee walked by and slid the ranch on the table. I was done my meal at that point and the other items never showed up. Sure not huge issues but I think the kicker was that when we mentioned that were disappointed with the experience, rather than a genuine apology for or trying to understand or resolve the issue our server simply said sorry but there's nothing I can do, there's ju 2 servers on and it's crazy busy! It was a strange response. I've been to Montana's where there's been a wait for a table and had a fine experience. The restaurant was not what I would consider busy and we saw more than 2 servers in our area alone."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever, and then redeemed. Just came here for my 10th year wedding anniversary to have a good time.   I ordered beef ribs with a baked potato with no bacon bits.  What I got back was a 6\" beef rib that was almost as small as the guys dick who served it for me. And surprise surprise bacon bits.   When I asked him hey man I think you got the wrong size ribs. Because I go to the NE location all the time and order the same thing every time. And that rib is at least twice the size.   This young man smiled and said unfortunately they vary is size and looks like you got the short one sorry about that and moved on.   When he came back to see if we were doing good or not. I told him about my potato has bacon bits and how that's not really helping my experience here.  First the overly small rib and now this potato. All I got was another potato and nothing else.    I am not looking for discount. I came here for a good experience. I think the guy saw me open up this app. And came back and said I am sorry about the incident and here's a 20% discount.   I told him I am not looking for a discount. But he added it to my bill anyways."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to watch the Raptors game. The staff was great there. Very attentive and very fast service.   The game was on and the bar area was full compared to the dining area. But the manager refused to turn the games sound on. Instead we had to listen to the music they picked.   The managers reason for not playing the game is because it's a family restaurant.  In short. To all sports fans or people that want to go chill at a bar. AVOID this place. You will be wasting your time and the atmosphere is not there"}
{"text":"I like montanas. I like their food and atmosphere.  It's a really good place to go for food and drinks on a laid back day.  Their patio is also very good during summer time.  They have all you can eat ribs which happens every Wednesday and everyday during summer time. My favourite appetizer is their Antojitos and their need nachos which 2 ppl can share and be full.  Mmmmmmm delicious"}
{"text":"Montana's has gone downhill in quality since I last remember. It reminded me of a family place you would come for birthdays and you would get the viking hat and all the staff would sing for you.  There is no chance for a choir of staff to sing for you because there are only 2 waitresses working the entire restaurant! The food has worsened over the years.  I ordered the half rack rib dinner, and only the ribs were edible. The baked potato was very basic and bland. No. Butter and sour cream did NOT help.  The ribs were decent, but tasted like they were de frosted. No smokey taste. The coleslaw was absolutely disgusting and tasted old and rotten. Cornbread was hard as a rock, and stale.  I will not return to Montana's again in the future.   NOTE: The service was good. Our waitress was kind, friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"I treat myself here every so often, just like Wild Wings. I highly recommend the grilled cheese cheeseburger! It's quite the mouthful but I adore it so much! Also try out some of their new BBQ flavours! You never know which you'll like more than the regular \"bold\". It is a pricey place to go but I say it's fine once in a while. I like the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"It was very yummy and service was good! I order the pull pork and it was juicy and tender! The bun was super soft and the fries were crispy! I really love the different types of food you can get here great selection of everything! Our server was nice and things went really well no line ups no wait"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever Took over 10 min to be seated and it wasn't even busy, greeter finally got to the door only to look like she just rolled out of bed and was upset that she had to seat us  Another 10 min by the time and our order gets taken.  All in all we sat there for 40 minutes sipping water and Coke with not even a glimmer of acknowledgement. Can't review the food cause we never got served - we just left.  I almost felt like my server was avoiding us on purpose every time he passed he looked at us but didn't say anything, everyone else around us was being looked after promptly except for us. Quite appalling customer service, I have no idea how you run a business like that."}
{"text":"Great decor and service. I have been to several locations for this chain and the food has also been good but this time I had a salad and it was at best a 2. But the other aspects bumped up my review to a 3. Skip the extra cost avocado on the salad as it was a weird translucent greenish color. They offer beer samplers so try them first as I think a line or two was skunked. The other reviews are pretty solid so the bottom line is and I should had thought about this, don't order a salad at a BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy the food at Montana's but this time my partner found an 8 inch long hair embeded in the fried chicken.  We immediately let our server know and another order was cooked for him. But there was no deduction from our bill for such a gross food no-no. Sad to say but we won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Tony V was our waiter tonight at Montana's on The Queensway. As my husband and I celebrated our 39th anniversary with our daughter and her hubby and our grandson we were looked after with the best of care. Our grandson is allergic to eggs and Tony was attentive to this at every course of the meal. Not many waiters would go above and beyond as he did which included chasing after us with the baby bottle in the cold parking lot after we left it on the table. I totally recommend this  restaurant and the food to anyone."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I want to save others from the same fate. Let me explain how I think Montana's makes their BBQ Brisket and sauce so you can recreate it at home: 1. Go to local deli, order thinly sliced beef 2. Put beef on a plate, place in microwave until it has a dingey grey color 3. Serve with sauce made of ketchup, brown food coloring and maybe a little garlic salt for taste.  I should have known better because when I entered the BBQ restaurant, there wasn't a single wiff of smoke.  I would have eaten my own vomit instead had I known what it was like- it would have tasted better, saved me some $$, some calories and probably would have tasted better...."}
{"text":"Just sold in January to a 30 year old trust fund kid with zero restaurant experience.  I suggest you wait six months until he is bought out and it might be good again."}
{"text":"Came here for all you can eat ribs. Ribs were good and they brought more fairly quick. Got to eat a ton of ribs which was the point of going. Needless to say it was a good experience. They give you a can to dump all your bones and check on you often.   Ribs were fall off the bone, very large, meat was tender, the side of fries was plentiful and crispy. Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"The only thing I love here is the beef ribs (apple butter flavored)!   For a little over $20, you get a huge beef rib and a variety of sides to choose from (ie. corn, fries, veggies) w/ a piece of warm corn bread.   Some locations have pretty dry ribs, like the cow has been dead for over a century, but this location isn't so bad.   Montana's get packed fast on weekends, especially when there's a game on - you'll have no luck getting a seat by the bar.   Waitresses are friendly, and do their usual sign-name-on-table greeting. They check up on you from time to time, and make sure your drinks are refilled. If you're celebrating your birthday here, be prepared to wear a huge moose hat (worn by many others) and be sung to by the whole staff!   I suggest not to order anything but the beef ribs. Just don't order steak - something Montana's clearly don't specialize in.   Remember your lollipop on the way out!"}
{"text":"Bit of a wait for the food, but it was worth it. Food and drinks were delicious! My boyfriend got steak and I had pasta and the portions were a decent size! I'd recommend it! Drinks menu isn't the best but food is delicious and would gladly come back!"}
{"text":"As advertised .... Nothing bad, just your typical 'theme' place.  Food was good, salmon fresh, salad crisp. Service was quick.   That's about all you can ask for!"}
{"text":"Before today, I hadn't been to a Montana's in ages. My coworkers suggested this place and I agreed. Oh my golly. That was a very excellent suggestion. The menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I went to a Montana's. There are so many interesting menu items I could have chosen.   I went for the chicken waffle club. What is that, you might ask. Well, it's sugary waffles sandwiching fried chicken, bacon, and sriracha. It's sweet, it's a little tiny bit spicy. It's bold and yummy. This was such a good sandwich. It fulfilled all my food fantasies for the day.   I ordered the sandwich with sweet potato fries. They were okay, but I've had better. They were slightly too thinly cut and overdone.   Service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"I came here about a week or so ago. I would not return. They were very empty at the time and that can usually go one of two ways. 1. You get served really quickly and the food is excellent because they have a lot of time to devote to your order OR 2. You get served really slowly because the staff are goofing around since they have so much spare time and they don't realize they ran out of certain food items until long after you've ordered because they haven't been paying attention to the inventory due to all the fooling around.   Unfortunately I had the latter experience. The staff were very much enjoying themselves. Kitchen staff kept coming out into the dining room to try out special drinks the server/bartender (she was the only one in the dining room) was preparing for the staff. There was a lot of chitchat and joking around between the staff.   Food preparation? Not so much. Some of our order was unavailable and we were informed long after we placed our order (the substitutions that were made were not good). Some of our food was lukewarm (I guess heating food up took away from the staff's fooling around time).   If you go to this Montana's and they're empty, don't think you're going to get a prompt and good dining experience. You will leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the half rack of ribs for lunch. The food tasted pretty good, but I got the very short end of the rack so it was honestly more like a third of a rack. Also, if you order sweet potato fries, they give you much less than they do of regular fries (like barely half) even though there's a surcharge. So keep that in mind if you have a big appetite.   Service was good."}
{"text":"We tried sampler of 4 dishes and 3 sides and it is well worth the money. Dishes were delicious and nicely spiced; sides were okay. Both are in a decent size for 3 girls. We will go to Montana's instead of Kelsey's for sure in future movie hang-outs."}
{"text":"I'm a steak/meat & potatoes kinda guy & on a trip and saddled up to the bar looking for dinner. The decor and physical layout lends itself well to its namesake. The 12oz (I thought that this was the land of metric measurements :-) sirloin steak was well prepared (I like my steak rare and it was properly rare, not medium rare, but rare). The Caesar's side salad was OK as was the corn.  I got an order of wings to go and while the wings themselves were quite tasty, the accompanying sauces were pitiful, runny, lacking in flavor. I would have done better buying something at Sobey's to nuke in the hotel microwave.  The last part of this review was the sorry service. Perhaps I'm a bit jaded because I eat out often and have less experience at \"chain\" restaurants. But while my food order was taken quickly, the bartender did not deliver my beverage... another bartender noticed that I was high & dry and asked if I would like a drink. Dinner seemed like it took a great while, and the wings, ordered after dinner took at least 20 minutes to be delivered (there were all of 3 individuals in the bar area, and the restaurant proper was all of 15% full). While the kitchen staff was probably still coming in (it was early, 6p-ish), I expect better. When taking my food away, the bartender was chatting with her associate and did not bother to ask me if I wanted anything else -- which I did (the aforementioned wings). If I wasn't bringing them back for Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, I probably would have just forgotten about them.  It's not hard to find a good steak, IMHO it's service that makes an establishment stand out. And, while I would not return to this restaurant, I would not write off the chain because of one visit. Forewarned is forearmed."}
{"text":"Out of the chains we normally choose Montana's, that said, it's good, but for a chain. The Antojitos were consistently good from last year that we had them here. We tried the Smokey Mac&Cheese and it was surprisingly good. For the lose, the Pulled pork potato skins were just saturated in grease, a pool of it, and I think there should have been more pork. The servers at this location have done well enough for the busy weekend we went on (Anime North)."}
{"text":"I love their smokehouse western wrap. That's what I get everytime me and my gf go there. Love their fries, and the atmosphere is nice, makes you feel like you're in a cabin of some sort. Being from the Los Angeles Area, and having a gf in Canada is tough but we sure know how to dine. :p"}
{"text":"For those of you who want an evening that involves paying to eat and be served, don't expect too much from Montana's at Don Mills and Steeles.    This is the third and last time I bring my family to this restaurant.  It begins well, the server impresses you by writing upside down on the brown paper on the table, and drinks are promptly served.   On Wednesdays, when it is all you can eat ribs, the server vanishes when you are trying to re-order ribs. When you finally get your second helping of ribs, they are half of what you originally ordered, and over done. Waiting again for another re-order can take up to 15 minutes.  The server is a ghost, and when they materialize, it is with a plastic smile and fake enthusiasm. It is a waiting game, and they are trying to wait you out so you will be full, so pathetic. If you are going to have an all you can eat night, be prompt and attentive to those that have come to eat, and stop playing games.  Beyond the aggravating wait to get your food, another aggravation comes when you try to leave.  Twice I have been left without a receipt. The first time the server promptly vanished into thin air without bringing me the Visa machine! When I notified the manager, I had to wait another 10 minutes till they came with the original receipt so I could pay!  The last time it happened to me, the server had difficulties operating the Visa machine, apparently it had run out of paper, and it took 15 minutes to get a receipt printed for me! Honestly, 15 minutes.  In the end all I got was a plastic insincere apology, and a smile that truly said, \"I don't care\" .  Perhaps it would be okay if I was single, but having children with you is not easy. Time is of the essence.  Other Montana's have had better service, but this place is lacking in the basic elements that one pays to go out to eat for in the first place, food and the receipt."}
{"text":"Would you believe they tried serve a Cobb salad with no egg?! I didn't feel like making a big deal about it so mentioned it to server as we were leaving and she starts laughing saying the chef didn't forget but they don't have any eggs in the restaurant. It just was such a bland salad to begin with - do not order it!  So all I'm saying here is DON'T expect your meal to blow you away! In fact, don't even expect your order to arrive as described!!   The Caesar's (drink) were delicious and appetizers looked good on the menu. Doubtful I would return when there are so many better options out there. Why are chain restaurants  always such a disappointment?"}
{"text":"waited a few minutes to be seated, after waiting like 15 mins for the waiter to come and greet us, she had an attitude, the service in this place is horrid"}
{"text":"Our visit to Montana's was to use a gift card we were kindly sent after a horrific visit to a new location in the city. While perhaps being gluttons for food, we are no gluttons for punishment so opted to go with Calgary's original location that has been going strong for around 18 years. The service was initially outstanding, and the food was right up to what we expect a visit to Montana's to be and was hot, fresh and tasty. We had only one issue with this visit, and perhaps had I not worked for Montana's for 4 years in the late 90's I would have not had as much sympathy for the poor guy serving us! Their hostess slammed the poor dude! Several sections, split up as I remembered from back in the day. Three other servers who could have handled and accommodated any of his new tables in their section and appeared to be twiddling their thumbs with the two tables each they had, yet our guy was \"quintuple sat\" within about 10 minutes! A table of 4, then a table of 5, then a table of 8, another table of 2 and finally another table of 5. Luckily we were in no rush and after not seeing the poor guy at our table for about 20 minutes, but seeing him rushing around like a one-armed juggler, a manager came and picked up some slack for him, wrapped our food and got us the bill. This observation for a learning opportunity for the hostess aside, we enjoyed the excellent early service and were reminded of what I love so much about Montana's with the hot, tasty food that was completely absent at the other location. Still a solid \"4 star\" visit. The Antojitos are still exactly as delicious as they always were, and we tried two newer appetizers that we would definitely order again. Now, if only we can convince them to bring back the short lived, yet mouth watering Buffalo (baby) shrimp..."}
{"text":"Went into Montana's for lunch with a friend.  Wow!  What a change!  Absolutely lovely new decor in the bar.  I loved the old Montana's decor, but the changes made are really, honestly fresh and wonderful.  We ordered Antijitos, fast, fresh, and always wonderful.  Then I had the fish and chips, fresh battered in-house (not the crappy stuff you can buy at the grocery store and make yourself, like some places).  My friend had the Jambalaya, and loved it.  Of course, you can never go wrong with the Baked Chicken Penne, a staple of Montana's.  My son and his girlfriend recently went there and couldn't stop talking about the goat cheese pasta (they didn't say what it was called).    Having said that, the service was patchy for a bit a year ago.  FULLY CORRECTED.  Very attentive service.  We had such an amazing lunch, we plan to go back there often with our group of friends.  And why not?  This was one of many recent visits in the last few months when the service was just STELLAR! (but our first after the make over...)  Perfectly located if you are catching a show at Crowfoot.  I don't live in Calgary, but all of my friends live near by there, so it's one of our \"go to\" spots.  For a chain restaurant, we felt it to be a good value for our money."}
{"text":"Food was tasty.   I had 7oz steak and salad. Good. They sliced the steak up into chunks before serving. I found that odd.   Kids had ribs and Caesar. Lunch menu Mac and cheese and sliders. They all loved their food.   The meals are presented well.   But it was 1pm and the restaurant was nearly deserted. You would expect great service and a very attentive server with next to no other customers. Wrong! He was very slow on his return. One very strange thing our server did twice was make \"an executive decision\" regarding people's orders!  Like, what?  Who does that! It's a restaurant usually people order exactly what they want. He actually told us that he couldn't remember what one in our party wanted as a side so he \"made an executive decision\" and ordered her a ceasar. He did explain he would get her any side she wanted after the meal arrived. Well we waited so long and she was the last person to get her meal she was defiantly not going to waste any more time waiting on another side of her choice. He should have come directly back to the table and asked her what she wanted. He did the same thing with the children's deserts! Brought everybody the same thing without asking them what they wanted.   All in all I would go back because the food was good I would just hope for a different server."}
{"text":"Dined at Montana's with a party of 15 for a corporate function. Our server, Jessie,  was obviously a new server but his mistakes could have easily been covered up with a good friendly attitude. We ordered apps and then asked the server for cutlery. He responded \"yayaya\" which was very unprofessional. A simple \"sure no problem\"  would have sufficed.  After that, I placed my order while pointing at the menu to simply show him what I wanted. Having pointed to the menu, there should be no reason for a miscommunication as to what I wanted. When my food arrived, low and behold the order was wrong. I pointed to the menu and stated that I would like the ribs and the quarter chicken dinner.  Jessie brought out the ribs and chicken wings dinner and then told me he thinks he over heard the kitchen say they were out of chicken. Instead of apologizing right away to fix the problem,  he once again responded in a sarcastic manner.   The server responded in a sarcastic manner throughout the night not just to me but to the whole party. Orders were wrong and splitting bills accordingly took a lot longer than it should have. The server only did one quality check and did not offer any drink refills. Our party was given a 10% discount which gradually brought the bill down from $400. While settling the bills,  the server made a witty comment about us not wanting to tip him on the $400 bill. The food at Montana's was great, however the good food was unfortunately paired with a bad server."}
{"text":"It's good, not great but if you're looking for a consistent chain you got it here!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great here! Staff was also doing a good job. Don't order the beef Bites there were bad."}
{"text":"A pretty forgettable chain restaurant dining experience.   I admit to being a food snob, but I do occasionally dine at chain restaurants still.   $24 got me a 12oz Sirloin with 2 sides. It was cooked to order, but nothing to write about. My buddies got the ribs and seemed satisfied with them.   The highlight of the meal was my $7.99 32 oz Coors Light Draft."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The service was great. However I'm not impressed with the banning of straws, I don't understand why these establishments don't do the right thing and get biodegradable. It's a win for the customer and the environment. I've started banning even my most favourite places if they do this. I don't believe they have the best interests for their customers."}
{"text":"This place is really going down hill fast.  My last few visits here have been sub-par and my final visit was absolutely terrible.  I think I'm done with Montana's, certainly this one.  My Habanero Lime \"Margarita\" was watered down with an unsalted rim and, unfortunately, alcohol free.  This has happened before but this time she refused to replace the drink. The food was terrible,  my chicken fajitas were boiled chicken with BBQ sauce squirted haphazardly on top, the meat wasn't even browned and certainly not grilled. My stepson's steak was small and not cooked as asked for.  Our waitress was inattentive and rude.  At the end of the meal, I asked for the bill so we could get going. She returned a few minutes later, threw a desert menu on the table and practically ran away.  She never returned and we finally had to go to the front to get the hostess and wait while she went to find our waitress."}
{"text":"Montana's - at any location - is fairly mediocre.  I go with friends who are big fans, for reasons I'm not sure of.   Words like 'adequate,' 'tolerable,' and 'ok,' spring to mind.  French fries taste like they are right out of the freezer - all the time.   Ordered the beef ribs most recently.  One bone and some meat from a second bone for $25.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Better then the one at Bovaird and 410. Heartland area. Our server was awesome fast, checked in on us promptly and I came to the conclusion this will be my new Montana '.  Read my review about heart lake one."}
{"text":"Rude bartender (female). Went in for drinks, there were lots of empty tables but we were told 20 min wait. We go to bar and barissta refuses to sell me a beer because we don't have a table..That's just crap. Hostess got all snotty when I pointed out to her the 7 or 8 empty tables and booths.   I used to go to this location all the time untill this, haven't been back or planning on it.  The one on Airport/Queen, was there last night to dine is a much better local, service and servers were spot on. Good food also"}
{"text":"Much improved menu, food was very good. Service was average server was not attentive."}
{"text":"I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a glass of beer. The sandwich is good. Other than pilled pork, it also stuffed with coleslaw. I love the sauce that you could add in the side. The service is friendly. It's good."}
{"text":"The appetizer shrimp had heavy batter. First round of ribs was great and hot. The second we got some ribs that are partly cold. Service was great. Food was average...."}
{"text":"Food is exactly what the menu tells you it is - don't expect anything too gourmet. Service is usually good (never had a bad experience), drinks are a little on the pricier side for a bar but not a bad place to grab a bite, a drink and watch a game. $10 lunch specials are pretty decent as well  I've never had a bad time here yet so until that day comes I think a 4/5 is accurate.   Only downside is they close at 11 most days of the week, little too early for closing time at a bar in my books."}
{"text":"Good food selection if you're a meat lover. Fast friendly service and tasty hot food. Lot of seats, no wait time on a Thursday. Prices are a little high, but I keep coming back because it's good."}
{"text":"My experience here could be described as awful. The staff seemed to be quite polite while I was making my order, I ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings with a side of fries. This is when my experience spiralled downwards, after waiting almost fifty minutes for my food, I bit into my first wing to feel and rock solid and frozen wing, I was quite startled and decided to look farther into this situation. I found that every single wing I had ordered happened to be raw, I alerted the staff who brought me the manager, after explaining what happened I was given a 30% discount on my meal. I was very upset by this as I was still paying 70% of my bill for uncooked chicken wings. Needless to say I was extremely upset by this occurrence, and I will not be attending this establishment any time soon."}
{"text":"Ruined my daughters birthday by going to Montana's in Vaughan. Before I go on... the server was great!  After placing our orders the food took 45 minutes to arrive.  The server came by to let us know that the Manager was going to come by to talk to us about the delay, \"as they pride themselves on having food on the table in 15 mins\"...OK that sounded promising.  I saw the Manager hovering around the restaurant but not once did he come by to talk to us.  While we were waiting, an elderly couple got up and left before their food never arrived, they were tired of waiting.  They had the right idea!  When our food arrived some items on the plate are cold and some are hot!  Wow terrible.  My sweet potato fries were hot but not cooked.  Then the server comes over to let us know they are going to reduce our bill by 20%....OK that's somewhat reasonable!  Apparently they can't do math either because the amount they deducted was also incorrect. It was Saturday night but not busy at all!  I will never return to Montana's because of this bad experience, more so because the Manager should have manned up and came to apologize as we were the largest group in the restaurant at that time and waited without causing a scene! NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Dependable, good quality food, with great staff, and a family friendly environment. It can get busy in the evenings, so try to go a little earlier than usual.  The sweet potato fries are nice and crispy!"}

{"text":"Place was empty, only one family of three were eating and a few folks at the bar drinking beer. There were at least three staff working in the restaurant. Was seated in a booth and was told our server would be there shortly. 20 minutes went by and a server did not come. We decided to leave and only then did the staff notice us. I made sure they were aware as to why we were leaving. They didn't make much of an effort to apologize for their terrible service. I don't want to use the race card but part of me wonders if me being non-Caucasian had anything to do it. Servers seemed fine servicing their other guests. Would give this a zero if could.   We went around the corner to Melanie Pringles. Service was night and day. They were completely attentive, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Sent my salad back 3 times after they forgot the dressing, then the salmon. Not sure if it was just the server of the kitchen, but it didn't seem to matter."}
{"text":"Here on a Business trip. Went with three other gentleman to have dinner over at montana's Restaurant. It seemed to be about half full and we had eaten there before so we were aware of the quality of food to be expected which is generally good. After we placed our orders the waitress told us that they had a large party and that service was running behind schedule and to please be patient with them. We assumed that it would take an extra 15 or 20 minutes or so which was fine because we were drinking and socializing. One hour and a half later, no food, no manager, no hors d'oeuvres to keep us happy. It was obvious that others were starting to grumble as well nearby. Finally we demanded to speak to the manager to find out what was going on. The manager sheepishly came out and apologized profusely for what was going on stating that she had new staff on site that were struggling to keep up. The good news is, she compensated us for our meals which came out wrong or in bad shape but turned out to be free. We still paid for the alcohol and we took good care of the waitress but it just seem like a Odd set of circumstances to be there that long and not be able to get service without any immediate apologies or explanations from the staff. I would go back and try them again but I'd be curious to see if the service improves.  Keep an eye out!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment from the word go!  We had to wait 20 minutes for steaks that were very under cooked (asked for medium well, got medium rare), sent back, but when they came back they were better, but still not correct...I didn't think it was that hard to cook.  To top it off, both steaks were tasteless!    Ordering desert we ordered the donuts and coffee, it took 20 minutes to come too!  It was my wife's Birthday and there were no horns for her.  We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The service started off fine but halfway through my meal I finished my drink and wanted a refill. I put my class to the side and my waitress walked by me several times and didn't offer a refill. I had to flag her down 2 get her attention while she was chatting with a Co worker."}
{"text":"great food, cozy sitting arrangement and service was good as well..I ordered BBQ Fajitas and my friend had Wild Mushroom Chicken..."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend. The place was not full and took over 5 minutes for someone to notice we were waiting by the front to be seated. After we finally got a seat and ordered, it took them about half an hour to bring us the food. My partner had ordered all you can ribs. It took them another half an hour to bring in the second order. Have to mention the ribs were also cold by the time the waitress brought it to our table. Plain bad service and understaffed."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. Close to our hotel and the Toronto airport. Huge country style stable with a fantastic country playlist on the speakers. I could sit here all day. The very friendly waitress helped and served us real fast. We both had salads, one Cobb with turkey and one with salmon and avocado. Both great salads for a good prize. Some beer to go along with it. And she made the apple crumble for us to go. Deserves all 5 stars here."}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong, the food is fantastic, but the wait is the part that kills me. The staff has always been super nice and have never gotten anything wrong. The couple times I've been here they've accommodated our huge groups during the couple conventions that happen around here.      The wait for our food however, is abnormally long. The first time we got our food in a group of 10+, the food took forever. We dismissed it die to the size of our party. The next couple times we were in a group of 5, and the same wait met us.    The food is great, but careful if you want the mac and cheese, it's great but the serving is smaller than you would expect. The burgers, and sandwiches are fantastic and have a large serving.     If in a small group of 4 or less, this place is a nice 4 stars, until they speed up it can't change, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I went in January to celebrate my birthday with family. My experience was ruined by slow service. We waited over half an hour for the food and when it finally arrived it was ice cold. We asked to get it fixed and it was fixed but having to wait so long for the food really ruined the experience. Perhaps if it was understaffed we should have been told before we sat down. Taking my money to spend elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years! Spent many many birthdays here wearing their moose helmet. I've ordered every item off the menu and love the build your own tacos"}
{"text":"Went there this past Wednesday night, December 21st, around 10:30 pm. My partner and I seated ourselves as we were not greeted at the door. It was a slow night we were only joined by two other customers who sat a few tables away from us and left shortly after we arrived. We started off ordering a Caesar (drink) and a water, as well as the KAPOW shrimp. When the shrimp arrived we ordered our mains, smokey bacon mac and cheese for myself, and chicken tacos with fries for my partner. As we began eating the KAPOW shrimp it was obvious that it was overcooked and had been sitting out. It wasn't fully hot, the texture was very crunchy because it was essentially stale. We let the bartender, who was our waitress, know, and she was very accommodating and took it off of our bill. As we waited for our mains to arrive in hopes that they'd be better, I took a sip of my Caesar, only to discover in my mouth a long blonde hair (I am a dark brunette). I promptly stood up and took my drink to the bartender explaining that there was a hair in my drink that ended up in my mouth. She apologized and offered a consolation drink which I politely declined. She brought us two more waters to the table, which we then ALSO had to take to her as BOTH of them had dirty debris floating in the water. Again, she apologized and brought us clean water, which I was apprehensive to drink. Our mains arrive, the cornbread that WAS SUPPOSED to come with my Mac and cheese, she explained, was all out, so they gave me a terrible piece of \"garlic toast\" which was a soggy piece of white bread with pepper and butter. THEN, I noticed they forgot to put bacon on my smokey BACON Mac n cheese.... I waited for her to return with it with the bacon on it. We ate half our meals that were less than satisfactory and asked for the bill. Tipped the server well for trying to be apologetic and accommodating, BUT it was the worst dining experience. The chef obviously doesn't take pride in his work or is lazy, and the place is dirty, hair and dirt in drinks, TWICE? Unacceptable. This location needs a cleanup desperately and some staff that are a bit more observant about what they present to their customers. As someone who loves Montanas this was really disappointing and makes me reluctant to return, which is sad because of how conveniently close this location was."}
{"text":"It's your usual chain restaurant. I find it better than a lot of the others though. It's more kid friendly and we have always had good service here. Every time we have ordered as well the food has been good or above average."}
{"text":"Montanas we are not too impressed. We had a table for for 8, 4 adults, 2 teenage boys, and 2 young boys.... Took forever to get the server to our table, we ordered drinks and food at same time! I asked \"Can I have a piña colada?\" \"No we don't make blended drinks.\"  Hmmm I have had many there before!!!! \"Ok. I will have steak sandwich med rare.\"   \" Sorry we don't do med rare but we do blue rare or medium.\"  Is this not a STEAKHOUSE?  Son ordered ribs and shrimp.... Shrimp way over cooked and rubbery   Food - 6 Service - 3  $198 meal..... Not worth it!"}
{"text":"I love Montana's. this was my first time going during a peak time(Friday dinner). Had about a 25 min wait. Usually I wouldn't wait I would go somewhere else but I had driven from midtown just for it. Our server Chae was really friendly and accommodating. Repeat: hells yizzles"}
{"text":"Used to love this place  Just went in for buy 1 get 1 apps. Was happy to buy a drink but was told I HAD to buy liquor. Asked to buy any other drink but booze and told no.  I need to pick up my kid from daycare in like 30 mins.  So I left.  Not sure if just me, but never had the \"only liquor\" rule before"}
{"text":"Positives:  We were seated quickly. Decor is interesting enough to keep little eyes busy for a while. Paper covers the tables & crayons are provided. Doodling encouraged.  Negatives: Drink refills were slow & far between - actually service in general was at a snail's pace. Food took much longer than it should have. Portions were generous, but food was uninspiring. None of us completed our meals. (Highly unusual amongst our group.) Another group was sat immediately behind us, with people constantly bumping into us, even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  Admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of the Montana's chain, now & then a family member requests that we make a visit.  Usually staff are pleasant & eager.  While food is basic, it's usually a decent feed.  While we went knowing it would not be our best restaurant visit of the year, I have to say that I left feeling let down & with a desire not to return anytime soon.  Although, there were advertisements on most tables for their \"Kids eat free Tuesday\" promotion, we had to ask for the discount on our bill.  When I first inquired, the server informed me that they were no longer honouring the promotion, despite the blatant advertisement throughout the restaurant.  Upon asking to speak to a manager, the server went & returned minutes later saying that he had been incorrect and they would honour it after all.  When this is advertised within the location itself, one would think that you should not have to even ask for the discount, let alone be challenged on it.  Frustrating.  This alone will keep me away for a long while."}
{"text":"I am sitting here and want my money back. I ordered mac & cheese expecting gooey cheesy goodness instead I got dry pasta, with 3 sausage pieces and a few threads of cheese. My partners jambalaya was just overpriced with hardly any meat. The kids burger was dry. I am just appalled that we paid top dollar for a meal that was so unsatisfying. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went to Montana's for a dinner with our friends a few nights ago. The male who greeted us and took our order was polite and attentive, however we did not see much of anyone that night so I am not sure who our server actually was. I ordered the deep fried pickles and pumpkin cinnamon mini donuts. The pickles were great, nicely fried and the donuts were amazing! Very fresh and warm out of the oven. Everyone else had the spicy chipotle/jalapeño burger which they enjoyed. Size of the side of fries accompanying the burger was a little undersized but the burger appeared quite large. The downside of the night was when another female server took our payment at the end of the night and put the payment through without swiping our scene card, we were then told that we can still add scene points if we go on the website later that night however when we tried to do that, we found that the points have to be added prior to payment. Overall it was a good experience. Pricing was reasonable and cozy atmosphere. Will most likely return!"}
{"text":"Had a table of 10 they sat us at two booths back to back which made it hard to talk to each other and when we ordered we waited a hour for are food to be brought to us which some orders were not cooked right ie burned and not cooked all the way through the nachos meat was burned and every chip didn't have meat or cheese on them the brisket burger was a bit crunchy like it was sitting under the heat lamp for to long. At the end the waitress brought over the check without asking if we would like any tea, coffee or dessert     I don't recommend eating at Montana's"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kapow medium-well sirloin and shrimp meal. Food was mediocre, the steak wasn't consistent and was over cooked on one half. The endless shrimp were too breaded with tiny cute shrimplings. Mash potatoes were bland but the gravy saved the day! The best part was the baked beans! We spent around $85 and despite the not to exciting food our server Kat was fantastic! Hands down, she alone changed this review from a 1 star to a 3 star!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was about 20% full and it was noon on Mother's Day.  Would be my typical restaurant for this type of location but circumstances were such that this is where we went.  Service was extremely slow despite not many people being there.  I suspect this isn't a special occasion restaurant unless we're talking about a kids birthday.  I did have a large beef rib and salt and pepper chicken wings which were very good. My wife had the tomato soup and a skillet of mushrooms. Bogey' expectations always done a good job the the mushrooms.  If you do order the nachos, they are a bit hit and miss on how much of the ingredients they include.  Personally, I just ask for extra cheese and extra beef.  I don't mind paying a bit extra to get what I want, and certainly not a lot less than I would expect.  Overall this restaurant is what it is.  It's definitely not fine dining and the service can be deficient but the food is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"We went to this place tonight.  The quality of the ribs pretty bad, very dry, and not fresh. The manager was unfriendly and seemed like she was just doing her job. She probably needs training on customer service. The girls who were serving us tried their best to make us happy.  Overall it was a \"never again\" experience."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We arrived early (before 5) to avoid the rush and get timely service.  What a mistake.  NO SERVICE was to be had.  Every one seated after us received their meal.  When we complained the server stated that it had only been 20 minutes.  THe manager later said that it was 23 minutes.  My watch (which is used to time sporting events said that it was 30).  Irregardless, the manager requires a course in conflict management and frankly none of my party was impressed with the food.  My steak was good, but the shrimp overcooked.  My partner's fries were old and the lettuce on one of the burgers was wilted (perhaps by the heat lights waiting to be served?)  AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE (ANYTHING ELSE) I GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF"}
{"text":"Fast and great service! Comfortable and friendly environment. Tried a couple of things on their menu including wings, ribs and steak. All on par! I especially loved the ribs. Tender, juicy, and just the right amount of sauce. Half price wings on Mondays too. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"If you want the chain, westernized, family food experience do yourself a favour and visit a Kelsey's or better yet a Jack Astor's. These places at least offer unique dishes with some interesting flavours. Montana's is as mediocre as it gets. Run of the mill, predictable dishes with little oomph. I had the chicken wings, which were coated in a weird grainy corn meal, and the chicken fajitas, which came with squeeze tube guacamole. Pass!"}
{"text":"For the most part the food and service is good. Don't suggest going on a holiday or anything though. Last Valentines I came and I had the worst dining experience. The food was so dry and was not good but they would not take it back. Every time i put my fork down someone would ask me if I was finished eating. I felt so rushed and rightly so because i was in and out in under 40 minutes. I did not enjoy my experience here at all."}
{"text":"I loved the paper table cloth with crayons. I don't care who you are, that's awesome. Everything here had great potential, the execution was just off. We ordered rib tips and some cream cheese roll concoction. The consistency of the roll was soggy, as if it were a screw up from 30 minutes prior. The rib tips are the only reason this isn't one star, but even then there was something funky about the texture contrast.  My chicken was drier than the first chicken I cooked on my own. The gravy was standard dark gravy. Potatoes were instant-status. The corn bread was the first piece I''ve had that I did not like. My friend's medium steak was well done. Everything was there. They just had horrible execution."}
{"text":"I come from a family of meat eaters. We are never satisfied with just a small salad with only a sprinkling of dressing and maybe a small roll for dinner.  We eat with our hands; we love the feeling of sauce on our fingers. Which is why we love Montana's Cookhouse. While the service is not always the best, the food is delicious. The rustic décor fits the menu perfectly. It does not feel like we are in metropolitan Toronto, it feels like we took a vacation to the American Southwest. My kids are very happy when we go there, which never fails to make me happy."}
{"text":"Went with a work party of 12 people on a Thursday afternoon with the restaurant maybe 30% full.  Servers are so-so.  They keep walking by your table and do not check up on you for refills of drinks or if you need napkins, etc.  We had to keep flagging down multiple servers to assist as they did not seem to have full interest on an early afternoon lunch.    One party member ordered a vegetarian pasta (religious reasons).  Steaks were ordered medium rare.  Other dishes like apps and ribs and chicken were ordered as well.  Out came pasta with shrimp in it.  Had to call the manager and he apologized and only offered not to charge for this item on the bill, no other compensation.  Steaks came out as rare and had to be sent back for more cooking.  Ribs and chicken dishes came out fine.  One of the last items to come to the table was salad and soup.  It took extra long to make a house salad and soup compared to meat plates.  Finally, had to pay for alcohol and was overcharged.  Server said that the system shows the price and that is what is to be paid.  Had to obtain drink menu from the table we were seated at, and then the server showed this older menu (outdated?) to the manager.  No apology again for incorrect service, and just an explanation that they can't keep control of all of the menus at the restaurant and the prices.  Very poor excuse.  Paid the bill and departed.  Likely will not return again.  Service was very slow for Thursday at 13:30 in the afternoon and inattentive service for such a large work party where priority is usually given above smaller tables.  Party members were not impressed at all.  This restaurant has a lot of potential, but if the interest of the restaurant is not there, then it is not there I guess."}
{"text":"Just finished rib and chicken combo with my bf and it was not so good. They gave us a half filled mash potato dish and both meats were dry. Definitely not coming back to this location. Location on the queensway at islington is awesome. They know how to keep customers returning. Stay away from vaughans montanas it sucks!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the allstar game on a Sunday night.   Pros  - Nice ambiance  - Good tasting food  Cons - Pricey for the quantity of food you get."}
{"text":"This place sucks to put it simply. It's probably because it's in a location that's not really central to anything, but the quality is shit all over the board. The service is a joke and the food is nasty. Our server seemed to be more interested in hanging around in the kitchen or something, than serving her customers. And the food...oh good lord. You can tell this food is your cookie cutter, microwaved crap. The ribs tasted like hot dogs, the pasta was sloppy and the antojitos were mushy and looked like they were cut up by a five year old. We also were sat near the entrance to the kitchen and you could hear the cooks swearing and complaining about working. So do yourselves a favour since the workers here don't seem to want to work hard. Take your business to a restaurant that actually makes their own food and wants your business."}
{"text":"OMG,. The worst BBQ I've ever had in my life.   Lol. I mean it was that bad.  Ribs, awful, Pulled Pork, awful, the chicken is fried not BBQ'ed, corn bread awful. How this place stays in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"I won a gift card for here on Twitter a couple weeks ago and took the kids last week for a late lunch after a busy day out shopping.   Being after 1 pm it was rather quiet and we got seating in a relatively empty area.  The kids loved the concept of drawing on the paper covered tables.  I know it's not a new thing, but they don't get out much being 5 of them and all.    They wanted to eat out of a truck and so they did.  The kids meals all come in a cute cardboard truck reminiscent of my trips to White Spot as a child for the pirate packs.  The food came quickly and was good.  Typical family friendly restaurant fair.  I like that I could choose a quesadilla that was a healthier version with a whole wheat tortilla and reduced fat sour cream.     The staff could have been a little friendlier, but all in all our experience was pretty decent."}
{"text":"They ran out of ketchup.  Well, that and an entire list of items the server read off to us as we were being seated. I honestly thought she was kidding about not having ketchup..."}
{"text":"Went in at 8pm on a Saturday night to find the restaurant quieter than what we'd expected.  We were seated at a table fairly quickly. However from there the service was quite slow, it was 10 minutes before our drink order was taken, and those took awhile as the waitress said she was \"waiting for the bartender\".  It seems she had to then \"wait for the kitchen\", \"wait for the bartender\" again, and then \"wait for the factory to make more napkins\" as her service was slow all evening. Food quality was good, I'd ordered the roast beef sandwich which was tasty, however not as hot as it should have been.  The sweet potato fries were average, verging on being too salty.  One of our party asked for no bacon on her chicken Caesar salad, which ended up with bacon anyway.   I suppose the main complaint was slow and inattentive service, so we tipped accordingly.  Nothing during the visit screamed \"stay away\", but it didn't really scream \"come back again\" either."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a couple friends and had an awful end to the meal when our waitress condescendingly lectured my girlfriend about her 15% tip. The waitress had been friendly the whole meal so I tipped 20%, as did my friend, and my girlfriend tipped 15% because she didn't have any more money (her meal was $17 and she gave the waitress a $20 bill). The waitress changed her tone and said \"I know you guys are young (we're 18) and maybe don't understand, but I make nine dollars an hour here, that's not very much. So giving someone a tip this small is inappropriate.\" My girlfriend was needlessly embarrassed, and my friend felt so guilty that she left an extra $10 bill on the table. The waitress came back and said \"I know you guys think I'm a dick, I know you think I'm a bitch but I just thought you guys should know how to tip.\" I think publicly humiliating someone about their tip is unprofessional, I think disclosing and complaining about your salary to a customer is unprofessional, and I think swearing is unprofessional. Not to mention, no one got a thanks for their 20% tip! Will not be eating here again as I don't want to run into this waitress."}
{"text":"I have not been to one in a long time and joined friends here. I loved it .. staff a wee bit slow not overly attentive ... that's my only complaint.  We joined friends here the atmosphere was fabulous I loved everything including the big truck hanging above the bar from the ceiling.  Pretty cool.  The food came out great appearance, temperature and tasty!  Awesome"}
{"text":"That must have been our worst Montana's experience yet. It all started with clearly watery Pepsi that escaped the waitress' attention. Replacement drinks came after a while the light brown water sat on the table for another five minutes. We were missing cutlery and despite asking for a set it took forever for spare to arrive after I had already eaten what i could with my hands. Both pulled pork sandwich and fajitas ( with all the parts to it trickling in, the extra guacamole only after another reminder! )were so bland that finishing it would have been torture. No apology for any of the mess ups. The service was just sad and the waitress displaying attitude after we didn't give a tip for the crappy overall experience just topped it off. I'm blown away by how bad of an experience that actually was."}
{"text":"This location has now closed. It was known for it's slow/poor service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Good place for ribs especially during the all you can eat promotion. Recommend the kapow shrimp and generally all their meats. Very kid friendly environment and a good stop before or after a movie next door."}
{"text":"The service was ATROCIOUS - probably the worst I've ever received. We went in quite late one night (although an hour or two before closing) and waited a good 10 minutes for anyone to come over at all, it wasn't very busy and a couple of girls walked by saying they would be over to take our order. We were finally brought one of our drinks (not the other), and after 35+ minutes no one had come by to take our order so we left. The people behind and beside us asked for a manager for what sounded like the same problem  I can't imagine how the service could have been worse - absolutely abysmal and will NOT be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for a party, but not the best for just a date. Food is great, service could be better. The way they handle scene points is kind of odd too."}
{"text":"The hostess walking in very pleasant  The waitress serving us , was away on the phone throw a whole visit The girl dropping off our food was fantastic and pleasant  The assistant manager Joe when I talk to him about the waitress was very understanding and listen to us Appetizers were fantastic We plan to go back to try there all you can eat fajitas The only reason I'm not giving it a five star is because our waitress but one bad apple doesn't spoil the restaurant  Definitely we will return as we like the atmosphere and 99% of the staff"}
{"text":"Two times this week From the hostess at the door To our waiter Jese Had a root beer and a Jim Beam, really tasty Tonight we had all you can eat fajitas. Was totally delicious Our waiter just was one of the best we've had in many years  All I can say it's great management to have stuff like this Joe was on call the other day and Leo was on tonight.   Totally recommend this location !!!"}
{"text":"June 31 2018  After year finally resolved Samantha and Jessica stood up took the initiative to contact me to resolve the issues finally we're going to give it another try  June 14 2018 They said they were going to contact me, what year is the questions . So far no one has followed up after Adrianna said she would .....ok  Next yesr i check b  Update May 21 2018   Was finally  contacted by Adriana today ; finally someone who respondes I think next time in Canada because of her kind words i will try this place again   This used to be one of our favorite places  The staff is deteriorated in the last 20 years So is the food, not worth what you're paying Seems management doesn't care  Yesterday i got a text from the head office to call .  I called and the girl Ashely. I think her name was... Was like \"Do you want me to pass your information to the local resturant .\"  I told her \"i received i text to call\" She said \" what  do you me to do ?\" Lol No wonder they have 2 Stars    Big Company they dont care"}
{"text":"meh, nothing over the top special, i do like the ribs, and once in a while they have all you can eat ribs. only problem is you cant really eat more then two racks of ribs, it just not possible for the average person. the service is okay, the decor is very nice but its generic to every location."}
{"text":"I came here the other night and had a really good experience. The waitress was really nice and friendly. She also provided us with excellent service. Throughout the evening she continued to refill our water glasses quite quickly. This is one thing I always rate employees on because I drink a lot of water.   We both ordered our meals and they arrived rapidly. I ordered the jambalaya on rice so it would be gluten free. The dish was delicious and it contained shrimp, chicken, smoked chorizo sausage, peppers, and onions. I highly recommend it to any seafood lover.   My friend also really enjoyed his dish. I believe he tried the beer-battered fish and chips.   Allover, I would definitely return to this location to enjoy another meal."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for a patio hangout. Not really knowing that area, the location was really easy to find, and the patio was really spacious and relaxing. I wasn't planning on eating much, but the waitress was pretty persuasive.  I started with their oven-baked Antojitos with their pesto sour cream. Holy antojitters in the loins of my taste buds, batman! Absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the same thing and agreed with my assessment. That set the Montanas bar pretty high, and I had no idea what to order after that. The waitress recommended their chipotle 'firecracker' burger. Works for me!  Questions I never want to ask myself: -\"What is this weird discolouration?\" -\"They want to harvest my WHAT?\" -\"The DNA result came back positive?\" -\"Is it just me, or does this burger kind of suck?\"  Well, scratch the last one off the list. Harumph. Classic example of putting too damned much on a burger. They take a sizable patty, add the standard burger toppings to it, then throw in jalapenos, bacon, chipotle honey BBQ sauce, and a mountain of crispy cajun onions (baby onion rings?).  Now, maybe it's just me, but if I have to force a burger into my mouth, I want it to be due to the patty being so thick, and not because I'm trying to navigate around falling jalapenos, a barbed wire onion ring fence, and chipotle sauce and grease pouring out the sides. By the time I was finished with the burger, it looked like I had washed my hands with grease. Yum! The sad part is that if they removed the onion beard from this thing, it might actually be pretty tasty. I did enjoy the chipotle sauce on it.  Can't win em all I guess. Great patio, good service, good prices, amazing apps, and a disappointing burger. I shall return."}
{"text":"SERVICE: This older lady was a bit grumpy when taking my order and my mother's.   FOOD: Overly priced for food that isn't great tasting.   I only come here when I get a gift card. However, I would like to try the appetizers of pickles deep fried next time if I go back again."}
{"text":"Fries are great but the overall portion is smaller than the usual in comparison to other Montanas. Place is quiet and not too busy however the server did not come by our table to check up on us. Took a good five to ten minutes to actually get the server to come to our table. I am not sure what our server was doing but he suddenly knocked over my glass and my pants were soaked for the rest of the night. I would probably go and recommend to others to go to another location."}
{"text":"I came to this Montana's with some friends and it was okay. The server was amazing!  She was super friendly and sweet.   However, the food was another story. The steak was a 1 or 2 out of 5. It really wasn't anything special. The house salad and baked potato that came with the dish were good. :)  I didn't come to the restaurant for the side dishes, so I would give them a 2-star rating overall."}
{"text":"I was contacted about having management wanting to make things right and when I was told I would be contacted within 1-2 business days, I never heard back or anything. It has been two weeks since I received this message! I guess they changed their minds about wanting to look into an issue and improving their service."}
{"text":"Our server was delightful..especially accommodating for a large group of 14 people having sunday lunch. Ordered the rib sampler with fries and coleslaw. Everything was delicious except the ribs were a tad bit overcooked (dry). But it's nice that the tables are equipped with bottles of different flavoured sauces. Their portions are reasonably sized and price for lunch.  It was so cheerful and sweet when all the servers sang for the birthday gal (sign up for the mailing list online and you get a free dessert for your birthday!)"}
{"text":"Food was decent but expensive for the quantity. waitress was slow and uneducated about what she was serving. Left my friends and I waiting for a while because she messed up the receipts. I personally don't understand why this is so difficult. We asked for a to go to container twice and she has yet to bring them over."}
{"text":"We have given up on Montana's. It used to be our go to for an affordable date night or family birthday  however I don't think we will be returning unless I hear good things again. Our last visit was so awful we were given 40$ in certificates to use. We won't be going back even with the coupons :/ our order wasn't entered, when we finally got it it was overcooked.  They took both meals away and brought them back 20 minutes later. My husbands food was now overdone. By now we've been there 1.5 hours. For subpar food and a server who wouldn't even acknowledge the mistake or apologize.  The manager was nice and gave us the coupons plus our food was free but like I said, we likely won't even go get our free meal there. It's too bad they used to be quite good."}
{"text":"My family and I used to eat at this location frequently. The staff was always pleasant and we enjoyed the atmosphere.  We no longer live in that area but we try to eat there every now and again.  While i know that all Montana's are roughly the same, we have always had a strange comfort level with this particular location.  You can't go wrong with good food and good people."}
{"text":"Apparently Montana's is famous for their ribs and oddly enough, I don't come here for the ribs. I've been disappointed each time I have ordered the ribs. \"Are you sure you're famous for your ribs Montana's?!\" Because I sincerely don't get it...  What I come here for is, the mac n cheese fritters! There has only been one other place where I have not been disappointed with deep fried mac n cheese and that place no longer exists. So Montana's you are it! You do deep fried mac n cheese right and therefore I am a regular!   Oh and don't order the apple cobbler crumble thing for dessert. It comes drowning in a cinnamon, overly sweet sauce... hardly any apples or crumble to be found! Hash-tag true story.  My 3 stars strictly goes to the mac n cheese fritters and the friendly hostesses that are always so thankful at the end of each visit! :)"}
{"text":"It was ok. Nothing to brag about. I asked for a dessert menu and they didn't have banana pudding."}
{"text":"Drumroll, the winner of worst restaurant experience of the year goes to:  THIS Montanas  I've always been intrigued by Chain Restaurants that ignore Quebec. I normally avoid these types of places back home, but I go out of my way to go when they don't have a Quebec address.  This is one of those places that has a nice glossy menu,  generic harmless decor and fake ambiance.  I would expect the food to be ok-good to great (if we're lucky) The last thing on my mind would be the service, it's normally much better at these corporate places with employee training and scheduling that predicts how many people are needed.  The service itself was not the problem, it's the lack of service.  We had just finished convention, 8 dudes starving, they told us it would be a 30 minute wait and we could wait at the bar for a table. Fine.  Order drinks ( My Caesar was supposed to have candied bacon, they ran out and put CELERY)  We all order apps and this is where things get ridiculous, some got theirs in a quick amount of time, others ( like me ) had to wait over an hour just for bar food like nachos and poutine. Others got their main dishes before I'd even received anything.  I tried the ribs from a friend and they were not that great, another friend said his steak was dry.  Finally got my nachos, and they are stone cold, they brought another plate, tastes good and the portion is quite big for a good price, but it all goes back to the service.  It was obvious that they were short staffed, there were 2 employees and 1 manager on a Saturday night (in our half of the place). The bartender was clearing tables, the other waitress was running back and forth. The bartender was obviously aware of how horrible it was and jokingly took his manager by the shoulder and said all complaints should be addressed to him.  I was expecting some kind of free drink or an apology from the Manager, but none came, I never had time to order a main meal.   BTW, the place was emptying and they had many tables available, but they just kept us as the bar.  I can understand if half the staff called in sick (it was a beautiful weekend in late September) and they had to work extra hard to cover absences. But if that's not the case and they like to cut corners by under-staffing, then it's a disgrace and an embarrassment. The prices are Keg Worthy, so no reason to pay $30  a plate and get treated like this."}
{"text":"It's a decent price and fairly good menu.  Service is nice at times. Friendly manager."}
{"text":"Food and service were good. I had the rib poutine and the kapow shrimp, and they both came in pretty quick. The meat on the poutine was a little cold though. The spicy hint of the shrimps was great."}
{"text":"Just another Montana's. Nothing special over any of the others. I go here with my co-workers sometimes. I'm not a big fan of their menu, especially their old one. The new one seems to be a bit better, but everything seems to be overly deep-fried or drenched in oil. If you're on a diet, run!   The chicken fajitas are awesome! They come on a hot plate and they taste really good. I guess it's also fun building your own food. The portion is massive, if you're just hungry, you may even share this plate.  What's curious is that they don't have a proper hot sauce. I mean, they have Tabasco but that's as hot as it gets.  The service is also fine, seems that they're a bit under-staffed usually during the lunch. But the girls are running around making sure that everyone is getting service. If you leave a review after your first visit (the code to access is on the receipt) you can get a 10$ appetizer on your next visit. I took advantage of this deal a couple of times since it's a 3 minute short survey."}
{"text":"This is a go-to spot for my group of friends and I.   The staff at Montana's Queensway are extremely attentive and helpful. They are also quite patient when it comes to us young adults having trouble deciding what to order.  The food here is really tasty (especially the macaroni) and the *one* time where it wasn't quite up to par the manager reached out and made things right.   A restaurant doesn't always have to be perfect, but what makes a place great is when they go out of their way to ensure no customer is left with their last experience being anything but a positive one."}
{"text":"Will Yelp! ever let us use 1/2 stars because this place is really 3.5 stars but not quite 4.  This was my 2nd trip to this location and 3rd overall to Montana's but my first lunch trip.  I like the layout since it is very roomy and usually not too bright. It was clean all three times despite two of the three times, it was overly crowded (always a good sign in a city with lots of restaurants).  We were seated by the window so a nice view of the outside (and it was sunny *sigh*).  While waiting for the server to bring our drinks, I noticed they have different specials daily; if you like ribs, then Wednesday is your day. If you like chicken wings, check out the half-price wings deal on Mondays. I, however, love their bison burger so I try to always get that. Tip: they will normally run out of the bison burger before 8pm or so so it's best to get it early in the day. I got mine with the chips (fries) and a Pepsi (which someone had turned up the carbonation on so yeah, that was AWESOME!).  The meal took about 10 minutes or so to arrive; not unreasonable.  The server was very nice and made sure that all drinks were refilled rather quickly.  I don't normally like to review a chain but this portion of the chain has a good thing going. The portion size is about right and the quality is pretty high (at least for the bison burger but to be fair, I have gotten that 2 out of my 3 visits).  I forgot to ask if they had onion rings (because I actually prefer those over chips).  All in all, it's a good experience to eat there. It is great for groups as they have lots of space including tables, booths, and bar seating. It's probably not too good for kids (if you are the kind of parent whom would have a problem with others drinking alcohol). The music is not too loud so you can easily chat with your tablemates or if you need to make a phone call. Another thing I forgot to ask is if they had free wi-fi.  So, forgetfulness aside, I'll be back and promise to try something besides the bison burger (uhm, yeah, right)."}
{"text":"First, let me say that the only reason why we went here is because I had a gift certificate.  We got here at about 8pm on a Saturday night. It would be a 15-20 minute wait. No problem. We wait at the bar. It was about 5 minutes before the bartender acknowledged us, another 5 before we got our order in. Not a good start. We ordered some garlic bread at the bar since we were starving, half with cheese, half without. The bread without cheese was warm, not toasty and didn't have a lot of flavour at all. I should also mention that these took forever since the first batch got burned or something.  We get a seat and everything goes pretty ok from there, the service is fine, the food is what you'd expect from a super chain place. The Huz got a burger and fries, I got a rib-eye steak and veggies. The food was fine, but I could make better at home. Not terrible, but nothing remarkable. There's a reason why I don't go to these places if I have to pay for it."}
{"text":"Gross and a long wait, we ordered some ribs and stuffed potatoes, and it took about an hour. The food was gross, servers were unhelpful they walked right by not asking us how our meal was or if we needed refills and didn't check on our dishes we order that took forever"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Montana's in a few years now and expected the restaurant to be better, there was a 15 minute wait to be seated and I could see atleast 5 empty tables.   The food came relatively quick and was pretty good but they were lacking flavors of wings. I would recommend getting something else. The fajitas were not bad but the wraps came out all stuck together and kind of ripped when you pulled them apart.   Overall I would give this restaurant a 3 out of 5, and would not go back if your looking for a nice restaurant to eat out at."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a foreign object in our appetizer that we had already paid for, and they said they were going to \"take care of us\" but there was no action taken to take anything off our dinner bill at all. They came over about 5 times to make sure things were okay, but that was it. We have had a couple bad experiences at Montanas locations so we will likely not be returning."}
{"text":"If you're cray about ribs as much as me Tuesdays are your best bet as its all you can eat. I checked in on a Sunday and decided to try something new. Chicken & Waffles were decent, but a bit too sweet in my opinion. The waffles had really big chunks of sugar in it, which could taste great for a sweet tooth like myself, but by the end of the dish I felt queasy. Steak was ordered as a medium well and came out well done. Service was good but the food just didn't get me at this visit."}
{"text":"Can't even give this one star- but apparently that's as low as I can go with a review. W were sitting at the table for over 10 minutes without anyone even stopping by to tell us they would be with us shortly. Not even a nod to acknowledge our existence there at a table - and that's when we walked out. You don't want my business, I don't want to give it to you..."}
{"text":"Wow. Great service and horrible food. Used to love this place but can now barely gnaw the meat off one bone before I stop trying and drive through Wendy's to fill the belly."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood however have never eaten here before.  It was Christmas day and nothing else was open for dinner.  Decided to give it a try.  The place was packed and there was a bit of a wait, no problem.  The staff were very friendly and the ambience was great.  There is an extensive selection on the menu.  Three of us were dining.  We started off with sharing a cheese nacho.  While it was very good and if you like jalapeno's it definitely had a good handful of it.  Half way through eating we had to send the nachos back as the cheese was not melted through.  Not a problem.  We also shared a four cheese artichoke dip that was yummy.  Two of us ordered burgers.  The one by her while it was cooked through it was still slimy in the middle.  We sent it back and it was removed off my bill.  The second burger was missing the bacon and at that point the person who ordered it sent it back because it was a disappointment and a turn off.  That was also removed from the bill.  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken.  I asked that the veggies be lightly sauteed, however it was over done.  The chicken was delicious but very small.  The fries were very crappy frozen fries. I would have expected hand cut.  My dinner also came with a slice of cornbread.  Which I just remembered I never got.  I will never eat there again nor recommend it.  I've been to Milestones across the way several times and was never disappointed.  I selected a one star rating as I could not post my review without selecting a star.  My preference would be a no star rating."}
{"text":"The service is decent and the food is utterly typical \"roadhouse\" fare.  So why do they get four stars? Wednesdays, are why. If you like ribs, the \"all you can eat\" deal is stellar. The price is still steep [like all restaurant ribs], but if you have an, erm, healthy appetite it's a good deal.  I can only do it twice a year or so, and I won't tell you how many racks I can go through, but if you're prepared to hate yourself the next day, this is the place for ribs in the GTA."}
{"text":"Went there a few nights ago for my mothers birthday. All of us kids were home and there are a lot of us (20 people) so we tried to call ahead. They do not do reservations, so we asked when a good time to come in would be. They told us be there by 5 and we shouldn't have a problem. We got there at 5 and told them how many people and they said it would be a 2 hour wait!!!! I got frustrated and asked to talk to the Manager. He was workable and said that it was headquarters that says they do not do reservations which is completely stupid. He split us up and found us tables after we showed him that there were some available. If they would have waited like 10 minutes they could have put us all together, but the manager did not seem like he had worked in the industry long and could put that together. Their service was crappy. We had 2 different servers for the tables, and they did not really refill drinks, give napkins or cutlery, and they were extremely slow. My nephew spilled a whole glass of water while a waitress handed his mother some food and never offered to get napkins, just said \"its OK\" and walked away while my sister in law was covered in milk.  I would not recommend them, and I think it is horrible that they do not do reservations especially of parties that size!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I'll round down because it's not quite on par with other similar franchises that I've given 4 stars to.   For appetizers, we ordered Kapow! Shrimp and got a Four Cheese Spinach Dip for free from signing up for their email newsletters. The shrimp were great - lightly battered and deep fried to a crisp crunch. The Thai chili sauce wasn't too spicy but had a nice zing to it. The spinach dip was also good - very creamy and flavourful. However, I wasn't a big fan of the \"pita chips\", which were basically pieces of pita bread soaked in oil and then fried. I would've rather had nacho chips.    For mains, I ordered the beef brisket sandwich with BBQ sauce and my partner ordered the pulled pork sandwich without cheese and with sweet and sour sauce. The waitress had mixed up our sauces and disregarded the request for no cheese. Good thing we weren't that picky though - otherwise, this incidence would've costed them a star. Both sandwiches were tasty and filling. The biggest criticism I have is that they were cold when they arrived - even the shredded cheese wasn't melted. As well, my \"beef brisket\" sandwich tasted much less like beef brisket and more like slices of deli roast beef, which was quite disappointing. I ordered a salad for my side but I still found that the meal deeply lacked vegetables. I wanted real veggies so I ordered the House Salad hoping it would be mixed greens, but nope, still romaine lettuce."}
{"text":"Having been to a Montana's or 2 before, I was not expecting a 5 star experience but was hoping for better than a 2 star... just wanted some MEAT tonight! Had a craving for a steak sandwich. Service was fine, no complaints - just a forgotten about water and wetnaps, no biggie. MON - 1/2 off wing night TUES - Family night - kids eat free  WED - all you can eat ribs We had no idea about these days and what Montana's offered so being Tues and kidless we opted to eat in the lounge. You could still hear all the kiddos from the other side, it was a zoo! Ordered a steak sandwich that was so fatty, another one had to be prepped for me and I ended up taking that one home. They tasted like the M&M Meat steaks that I refuse to buy, no texture to the meat, just flat and sinewy. The table lacked salt and pepper too that the steak badly needed. Brisket burger - meat patty itself was decent but the soggy, oily onions that gave the burger its height were too much - and we love onions. The brisket was sweet but was almost non-existent, lost in the onions. Margarita was OK, def. a mix, very sweet. Beer was served perfectly cold. The food and drink did take a long time to come out so do not be in a rush if you come to eat here. Free dessert at the end was a Mud Pie - NO WAY two people could ever finish that - it was good (ice cream, peanut butter and chocolate oreo crumble) . Management wanted to make up for the terrible steak and it was a nice gesture, we appreciated it. If you want nice, hot food, this is not the place to go. Will stick to the Keg for burgers and steak. I would never call Montana's a steakhouse as it claims to be. Got my YELP Carnivore badge tonight at check-in! Geeky I know but cool at the same time!"}
{"text":"One thing i always appreciate is a company with integrity.  I was very impressed today as one of the people in our group felt the fajitas were too spicy and they replaced them no questions asked with a toned down version.  The waitress was awesome, and the management made it clear that they were there to  please the customer.  Now beyond this, the rest of the food was awesome, the others had the Canadian burger and i had the beef brisket sandwich. All of which were great.  Now here is something interesting.  I happened to mention to the waitress i like dipping my fries in barbecue sauce and this very attentive waitress brought me some.  Now that is cool.  This location is full of integrity and people who are professional servers.  This is the type of place i like to be at.  Good food, and good people.  We will continue to visit this place, because they never let us down."}
{"text":"Sometimes service can leave much to be desired (slow at times); but it's a nice place to go for any occasion.  I like drawing on the tables (paper and crayons)  Food is good and typical Family restaurant stuff (chicken/burgers/steaks etc.) and there is something on the menu to suit most tastes & prices are decent.  It can get loud as people tend to go here in groups or for Birthdays."}
{"text":"not even worth commenting there's only   3 tables yet it took them 45 minutes to serve us horrible  food. 5 of us dined . Waste of money ribs weren't falling off the bone. all our meals were beyond  disgusting."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday in the bar area.  The lunch menu is simple and has some decent choices although limited.  You can still order off the main menu which isn't a problem.  I had a Reuben sandwich with added meat for an additional 2 bucks.  I had ordered a bloody caesar (or two) with bacon and I was happy.  The sandwich was tasty.  The bread was toasted just right and they top it off with a fried pickle.  The fries were good, not too overcooked  and the portion was just right.  It's been a while since I've been to Montana's but I liked getting my memory refreshed today.  It was a good experience and our server was very good too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and country.  It's pleasant but watch what you order.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp, what a pathetic looking piece of chicken.  Cheap and under sized, not worth the money at all.  The service was poor too.  When I asked the waitress about the chicken and expressed my concern she could careless.  The manager came by the table to make things better.  He offered to give us extra ribs and gave me a discount on my meal.  That was very nice of him.  This wouldn't have been an issue if Montana's offer a better quality meal for the money."}
{"text":"The chicken breast portion was tiny and the shrimp not properly cooked considering that they were supposed to be 'grilled'. The burger was tasty but worth $16. Not an enjoyable meal overall. Won't do this again, for sure."}
{"text":"As a big change visited a restaurant during a \"busy\" holiday - Valentine's Day - a traditional night for restaurants to be packed. We had decided on an early dinner (bonus points as we beat the rush that followed as our dinner concluded)  We have been to Montana's beforehand and remain pleased with both the service and quality of the food. Portions are generally on the large side. Server was knowledgeable and friendly able to answer questions about the food.  Prices are in the moderate to higher end. But you get good value. Only downside is a lack of an inner door to prevent the cool breezes from entering the restaurant.  Small tip. While all you can eat Ribs seem like a good value (only $4 more than a full rack), be sure you would be able to eat a full rack approx 14 bones- otherwise money can be better spent elsewhere (drink, dessert, or even in pocket)"}
{"text":"Very first time eating here. I got a coupon for my birthday at this restaurant so I thought I'd check it out.   Our server was Ingrid and she was very attentive. I like how she wrote her name on the paper table cover.    The overall decor is very home-y. It's like a cute cottage with nice lighting inside lol. I like how they have coat hangers by the tables.   As for the food, I got the four cheese spinach dip. It's pretty good. I didn't look at the ingredients list, but I didn't realize there were red peppers and I don't like red peppers. It was still good though. I got the chipotle burger. Delish. The only think I'm kind of not use to is not being asked how I like my burger done. I like how the menu contains how much calories the food has.    I'd be willing to try different items from the menu. Til next time!"}
{"text":"Came for late dinner after movie.  Service - decent  3/5 Food - it's been a while since I ate at Montana so I didn't realize their plating and portions has changed. The new plating was nice and neat, but the portion seems to has reduced alot. My old favourite Cobb salad was quite a disspointment.. a lot less lettus, less eggs, less everything..  Ordered half rack ribs -it didn't have too much meat but wasn't too bad too.   2.5/5 Price - two dishes (half ribs, large salad) with pint of beer for $50"}
{"text":"Well for a steakhouse, even a chain this place ranks pretty low. I had lunch there the other day and had a burger that we very good. This evening I made the mistake of having a Sirloin. Bad choice. The service was okay but nothing to write home about. The 8 ounce sirloin was to be medium rare was under cooked. It was also full of gr isle and was not rested properly. There were too many fries and it was bland at best. The bartender kept disappearing and it was just a so so experience at best.   The very worst part was a waffle and ice cream dessert. Looked nothing like the description or picture. It turned out to be fried bread sticks looking like what you get from Burger King. But they all fell apart.   Avoid this place in my opinion. Ugh I feel like I need to chum...."}
{"text":"It's alright, sometime there is some inconsistent but nothing too major. I had bison burger, its supose to be a dry burger which it was , the patty was nice but the burger was nothing special   I had some ribs from my father and it was pretty good.but he had all you can eat so 3 plates were good, one lack a good taste"}
{"text":"Shockingly bad food. The 10 oz sirloin was dry and tough, edible only if you're a German Shepherd. Cold potato, bland baked beans. Onion straws were greasy and gross. The salad looked like it came out of one of those bagged salads at the grocery store. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at this Montana's, but one thing will always remain and that is their exceedingly tiny portion sizes. To compensate for these small portions, they put lots of oil in their food, which fills you up, but makes it very unhealthy. I can't tell you how many times I've had diarrhea after eating here, so beware for those with sensitive stomachs.  The service is as you'd expect: overly enthusiast waiter in hopes of getting big tips.  Besides the portion sizes and greasy food, everything else is good."}
{"text":"Ok. When the manager has to come and apologize to me twice in one visit there is definitely something very wrong at the newly rebranded Montana's.   The first time was because their waiting pager system is broken and they sat three parties that arrived after us, ahead of us. If I hadn't complained, we would still be sitting by the front door.   I used to love the menu at Montana's. A classic cookhouse. Now they can't even muster up a steak. The waitress recommended I order something other than a steak because they only get complaints about them. Well that's the kitchens problem, not mine. The steak had a weird smell and a bad aftertaste. Basically Montana's has become an overpriced burger joint that also does ribs. My wife had the ribs and says Swiss Chalet is better. Not a good review.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was craving for ribs and I  remembered the  all you can eat ribs. Was COMPLETELY  IRRITATED.   So we came here and the hostess was not pleasant at all. Next I told here we had a toddler and she brought us to a table where she didn't even offer a high chair.  I had to ask another server who brought one for us. Next a server came by, didn't introduce herself or anything, but just asked if we wanted drinks. After we ordered, my daughter's  food came first and she had rice with her meal. Our server didn't even bring a spoon for her.  Instead of  waiting, hubby went to the kitchen and asked for one.  Worst thing is, I felt that other guests around us were getting better service than us.   Honestly, the food was great! Ribs and steak were moist and my daughter loved the chichen  fingers! But service was very disappointing and honestly I  don't  think  that  I  can come back another time with this experience in my mind. 2 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"So Montana's Vaughnmills. Some of the most horrible service I've ever seen in my life, regardless of understaffed environment. Seated at 5:30 : Took half an hr to get a waiter to come get our order and it wasn't the waiter. It was the manager I presume since he was wearing a different plad-coloured shirt then the rest of the workers. I've seen better service at a Chinese restaurant where they don't speak English.  Brings the appetizer about 10 minutes later, it's saucy. Forgets our utensils. My god I've never seen such... Stupidity.  Takes another 5 minutes to get a waiter around to grab their attention- debated whether I should get up and start doing service myself. Ordered at the same time as the appetizer. It's been an hour.  --- post status: been reading reviews on yelp etc and I've seen many who have suffered under the time management skills of Montana.   I want my god damn food already. It's probably going to be disgusting but I just want my fucking food. Should've went to teppanyaki's across the street or over pay for pizza at autostrada.   TOTALLY forgot why I hated the first Montana's visit at richmondhill centre and now I remember. It's not just the food that is half-assed like the chefs are gripping spatulas with their asscheeks in an attempt to probably video record a scene for jackass but everything about this restaurant is horrible and needs a re-work in management and organization. Undercover boss needs to get on this shit.  ----- 7:10 food came.  Forgot the sides.  Waiter says \"oh ya we're making a new batch of mash potatoes for you\"  Batch comes. I take a bite, my mouth cringes and I spit it out instantly. Potatoes were extremely cold. Dry. Like they left it out on the patio to have a smoke by itself. -- Steak comes, I asked for medium rare. It's well done. Are the chefs at Montana's retarded?  ---  Only thing good here was the extra 4.99 skillet of mushrooms I ordered because hey, who the fuck can fuck up a skillet of mushrooms.  Never... Ever going near this piece of shit restaurant ever again.  ---- Mac and cheese came. Concluded that chefs are idiots here ,  Asked for extra cheese, don't believe they know how to make Mac and cheese so they dropped a block of mixed , probably cream cheese in there and thought my girlfriend wouldn't notice or though the fucking shit cheese would melt away.   My god I've never been so pissed at food in my life .. And I fucking love food."}
{"text":"I went to Montana's last Wednesday with a girlfriend after driving around getting lost looking for market mall. I had never been to Montana's before and I was looking forward to it. Being a crazy burger person, I ordered the burger and my girlfriend ordered a steak.  When our food came out, it looked awesome. My burger was delicious but not anything super special (cactus club!). It was pretty average for a burger but it was delish. However, my girlfriend's steak was not cooked to her liking as she had asked for medium and it came out rare. The crispy onions were yummy looking and so was her baked potato. She couldn't eat her steak so she sent it back. They ended up coming out with a brand new meal after I was done mine. It was a disaster! Her steak was so dry and it was now well done. The crispy onions had been fried twice and came out burnt. The only thing that wasn't wrong was the potato.   Our waitress was less than impressed herself and went and got the manager who was very kind and very understanding; her meal was taken off the bill.  On the other hand our waitress was really great. She was friendly and efficient.   I don't think I would go back to Montana's anytime soon but if I do I hope the experience is better than my first one."}
{"text":"Don't order the \" healthy\" items off the menu. Chicken burnt, shrimp burnt....  order the ribs and other stuff it's ok"}
{"text":"Hey,  So I went to Montana's at Crowfoot tonight. It was really nice. I had a shirley temple and a Pot Roast Dinner, with mashed potatoes, brocoli and carrots. Everything was really good.   Then I had the 'Mile High Mud Pie' for dessert. Oh my God, what was that? They brought me out this SLAB of ice cream, with whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top and on the sides. Just to let people know, there is a half portion version of this same dessert. Anyway, I got the full portion, and the chocolate ice cream had a few peanut butter layers to it too. It was like a dream someone that loves Rieces Pieces would have...and it was totally awesome.   The ice cream was nice and HARD. I remember someone once asking me how hard I like my ice cream, and I replied 'hard enough to break my teeth'. :) Well, this is such a nice dessert because even though it took me a few minutes to eat it, it was awesome from the beggining to the end. Usually the ice cream I have is way too soft by the end of me eating it, but this thing was delicious and yummy. The good thing is, for those of you that like ice cream a bit softer, you CAN wait it you want, and then just slice at the sides...it's softer there. But for those of you who take your ice cream on the hard side, well, this dessert is cerainly for you too.   I'd say it's a two person dessert, even though I was in the mood to...um...'tackle it' myself tonight. Yes, I had flashes of being in an eating contest for a few moments because this thing was so big. It's such a good dessert though, that I don't want to insult it by comparing it to the stuff they might serve at eating contests.   Anyway, the 'Mile High Mud Pie' was just awesome. The place already had 5 stars, but this dessert just nailed it. The people there are really nice too.   Montana's IS AWESOME. 5 stars all the way baby."}
{"text":"So, I went to Montana's tonight and I got the Portobello Mushroom Cookhouse sirloin steak. I didn't really know what to expect, but it was AWESOME !!! Oh my God, there were a few things that made this steak really good. Steak is a really tough thing to get right, but they did it so well that I really enjoyed every single bite.   Ok, so first of all, they cooked it the way I wanted it, medium well, which is not easy to do. It's probably pretty tough to tell if it's done right...it's probably way tougher to get it right when the steak is really thick. But they got it right.   It was also spiced really well. Not too much and not too little, which is also tough to do. Lots of places don't know what spices to add or how much to add, but they nailed my steak tonight.   The steak came with portobello mushrooms (really?, is that why it's called the portobello mushroom steak? :)  ), delicious fried onions, closeslaw, fries and I got gravy with it too. It was a 12 ounce steak, so it was really filling.   The cheesecake tortilla with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and ice cream were awesome. The whole meal was absolutely fantastic.   The people there are really nice...a few people tonight made sure that everything was ok. To use a baseball analogy, my experience tonight was like a few pitchers throwing a perfect game. It's rare enough for it to happen with one person, let alone with relief pitchers coming in too. But everything was just awesome.   You guys at Montana's ROCK. 5 stars all the way !!!"}
{"text":"Located in a rather dreary, gray part of Mississigua.  The service I received for my take out was just fine.  I got an industrial produced hamburger (they called it sirloin) with fries.  It wasn't too bad though, especially the french fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a gift card and decided to try Montana's Newmarket after approx 3 years of swerving it. Let me explain. Our last 2 visits we experienced a plastic piece in a dessert to which the managers comment was - oh its just out of the dessert packaging so it's not been on the floor or anything. (So it's OK to choke to death on clean plastic?) and ordering a steak dinner for 2 (not cheap) and they forgot the extra sides we ordered.  So we tried again. I have to say the food was very good. The service was very good. The end of the evening was the most atrocious customer service ever and it took some digesting what just happened.  Starters we shared potato skins and kapow shrimp. Both were excellent and I would recommend. We ordered the same entree of jambalaya with rice and it was delicious. Again I would recommend.  However when we got the bill, we were musing over it (while our waitress walked past us) and we're wondering about why we had $15 discounted. Somewhere in the region of 5-10 minutes later the waitress came back and apologised that she had given us a discount that should have been applied to the next table. And took away our $64.80 bill and replaced it with a new one of $81.85.  I was not very happy and had I been with a friend would have questioned it complete with attitude. My husband being a typical Canadian did not want to fuss and much to my disgrace actually tipped. Of course knowing they have a survey I let that ride and will definitely \"tell us how we did today\" This spoilt a good evening. My son is a restaurant manager at another place (we were tied with the gift card to go to Cara group) and he said that was a bad move. Also only a manager can discount, so the blame for that is with the manager. Rachael who served us was dressed differently so I did wonder if she was a manager? Either way I felt their integrity was not sufficient. When we spent what we did they will not suffer for their mistake. Doesn't make me want to either rush back or recommend.ur review helps others learn about great local businesses."}
{"text":"This place will give u the runs   We got there Sunday around 1 and we get seated within 4 mins.   We go sit down get our drinks I ask our waiter about Sunday special he says there is none ... as I point to the fajita all you can eat. He says oh well ya that one I guess if you want it   Lol ok   Than we had free app. The app fine just fried pita and spinach dipping woohoo.   And we ordered the big smoke sampler ( whatever it's called ) and I wish I would of took a picture because now I'm on the toilet writing this and my stomach is hurting.   We had cold sausage :(  \" brisket \" was grey...... like legit grey and black  The pulled pork looked like my insides  it was so gross I'm a FSM and honestly I wanted to throw up because I know the pullpork was not made fresh because even my friend worked there for like 3 months and told me everything is reheated ( which all cara franchises mostly )   The ribs tasted so dirty and it was so crunchy and burnt. The sausage was cold and burnt like how???  Fries were really good though    Anyways  The waiter never checked on us he didn't even come out in 15 mins so than he came we told him it was \" gross \"   The rude manager came out and started fighting my boyfriend like honestly as a Fsm I would never fight with anyone.    Anyways the waiter said \" btw ___ they have free app coupon \" and he laughs. SO FUNNY   Never come back please the fried onions were just a mush too.   Garlic bread was good."}
{"text":"Good family place, lots of food, clean and free from the rowdy folks. Three star is because the taste yet to be good and price is pretty high! My kids love it so we will be there again!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant and was seated quickly,  Waited a while for our server to order drinks got pushy about us if we wanted apps. Finally choose what we want and waitress took forever to come back. She took our order for our app and dinner. We waited over 30 mins and  we got our apps not even 1 min later our dinner showed up. Part of my dinner was missing.  When told waitress she did not apologies just said \" oh did you order that it will be here soon\" you can taste it was rushed. It should have been taken off the bill since it was rushed & forgotten. Main meal, was not hot. Overall was not happy with my experience.  Date went: January 25 2017 around 7pm"}
{"text":"This is my second time and my last 6 of us on sept16/17 nachos came out with a big clump of cheese not even spread out vegetable burger and burgers cold as ice beware stay away don't waste your money this place sucks BIG TIME..."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today with my 3 kids. Not very many people in the restaurant. The hostess was really nice and friendly. Let me just say that I'm not sexist or ageist but our server wasn't that good. He was a grey haired older gentleman and his service wasn't too great. He took our order and then returned 5 minutes later and asked us if we were ready to order. I looked at him and said, we've already ordered. Drinks were not refilled and it was hard to flag him down for the bill. The food was ok, I got the chipotle burger with fries. The fries are quite good, not soggy, even when cold. My eldest got the rib bite lunch special with fries. They were rib cut offs but were nicely cooked and flavoured. Overheard the table next to us complain about their ribs. They said that they weren't tender, fall off the bone. Our server said that they were their new, in-house cooked ribs, and were like that now. They didn't pack the leftovers to go. My 2 younger kids ordered the kids meals.  It's ok to come here once in a while, we usually go a few times a year."}
{"text":"Great american food place.  Lots of choices and service was prompt.  Quality is good.  We all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"I went her for dinner on Wednesday, to celebrate my daughters' 10th birthday. The food is okay but it is not a family friendly place at all.  I went with my 3 kids, obviously the server knew that we were a low priced table and served us accordingly.(I don't drink either).  She never re-filled my kids drinks and didn't really bother us. The mini ice cream cones usually come with a gummy worm at other Montanas, but not this one.  No candy given with bill, either.  I have owned my own restaurant and always had candy for kids.  It makes their day and assures a returning customer. This place ain't kid friendly at all. My kids weren't asking to come back again. Shame because this is the one location that is nearest our house.(5.5 kms away). I will be taking them back to the Steeles and 404 location next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered both a AAA 10oz Sirloin medium for our lunch, when both plates arrived the outside was I little bit burned and once I cut a piece the sirloin was hard to cut and they were well done. I won't give one or two stars because the service was great, but food...."}
{"text":"I love Montana's but the last three experiences have been mediocre at best. Arrived at 7:30pm. Greeter was very friendly and set us at a booth as requested. Told us they had all you can eat ribs, so two of us from our table decided to get them.   We ordered our first ribs, you can choose your flavour and you get two sides. If you have taste buds, don't get the corn; it is served warm but has peppers and other ingredients including cilantro and lemon juice and something that does not work together And its chilled/cold in temp.   We got our first set of ribs and the waitress said, just so you know - we have no more back ribs so you can have side or beef ribs. We decided for side as beef ribs from my experience are fatty and greasy. We ate our first set and got our second. When she brought it out, she said they were running low and thought the next order could possibly be beef as they were now out of pork ribs. The manager came over and explained that they normally, on a promo night make 20-30 racks of ribs and because, one their other locations was being renovated - they make 50! I thanked her for the info but, truth be told, I did not care. We made a joke and asked if she would be ok being paid the bill in Monopoly money? At this point she's getting annoyed with us.   I normally don't care but I feel, if it costs $27.99 for the meal, I should get what I ordered/want. So the next set came out and they said we only have beef.  Which was in fact fatty and greasy.. I know, I am making a big deal of not being able to over indulge, but everyone has a cheat day, right?   I will say that the service is good. They do try to be sympathetic in a condescending way. But at least they kinda care?   Again, Montana's is an ok chain but, really, if you can't support a promo; just get rid of it. As a customer if I had no option I would not expect, anything!  However, Thanks for the discounted $12 as a compromise on an $80 bill.  I do appreciate it, but try harder on delivery of marketing events!   There are lots of chain restaurants in the area, practise your options is my suggestion! ;)  Ps: two hour ordeal"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Montanas yesterday  - myself and a few friends were going there prior to going next door to a movie at Sunridge.  We arrived about 515 and for a thursday night it was suprisingly busy. A young blonde haired girl ( who reminded me of a teenage Shirley Temple - blonde ringlets) arranged for a table for the 6 of us.  The evening was a bit of a disappointment and heres why. The wait for the food was quite long - we waited over an hour to be fed- from the time our order was taken. Our waiter - Andy was a really nice guy - friendly and efficient with our drinks, but the wait for food was nuts.  People around us were waiting too - a married couple in a booth looked miserable while they waited - I suspect they were always miserable anyways, but having to wait in silence for their food must have really sucked. At another table a little kid was gnawing on a straw and wear a paper antler crowd while waiting for his food... It seemed everyone was festering.   Because I wasnt really hungry I just ordered the nachos - I thought they would be good, but unfortunately they were bordering between lukewarm and cold and the cheese had coagulated into a cold orange mess on the plate.  I was really bummed, but wasnt in the mood to send them back, I just picked at them. I ordered a side of Cornbread - 2 little mini loaves and they were without question the best part of my meal. Other people at our party had things like ribs, chicken etc and their meals looked quite nice. Mine tho - sucked.  Montanas always reminds me of a Disney theme park restaurant - the theming is fun and done quite well - it s a shame that for me at least, the food was bad - and for what seemed like the whole restaurant - slow service from the kitchen.  Despite a friendly server -and fun decor - I wont be giving this Montanas another visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer here ever since they opened. I  only get one thing when I come. ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ RIBS! nomnomnom ... they used to have AYCE ribs on sundays AND wednesdays but now only wednesdays so keep that in mind folks. While they dnt offer side ribs anymore (only back ribs), the ribs are still as awesome as ever! Back in the day they had 3 bbq sauces u could pick for ur ribs. Now they have 6 but i still prefer the original 3 after trying them all. The sauces are texas bold, honey garlic, apple butter, chipotle honey, tangy peach and pomegranate-something.  Personally, apple butter and texas bold are my fave.  Anyways, my most recent visit was a pleasant one.  Our server Micah was attentive, quick and helpful (especially since i inquired her heavily about the beer specials =P).  Ribs were succulent, tender and fall off the bone as always.  The cajun corn and pot roast soup were my fave sides back in the day. Quality of the corn seems to have stayed the same but the pot roast soup's quality has gone down (too many potatoes, not enough meat). Nevertheless, i polished off a ton of bones!  Prices have obviously gone up since the deal came into fruition. Back in the day, the AYCE ribs deal was 19.99. Now it's 25.99 but imo well worth it for good bbq!  Oh yea, almost forgot, with the AYCE ribs u get unlimited sides and soups too. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken with buttermilk gravy... Chicken was over done and dry.. Buttermilk gravy was just too salty. Husband had the brisket with red mash potatoes it was mediocre.. Waitress was nice.. Would go for the bar but not for food."}
{"text":"I don't know where the problem is but the bartender and staff are working very hard, it just takes forever to get any food"}
{"text":"We went there for my son birthday.  He wanted Mac and cheese... And there had a smokey bacon Mac and cheese.  He said he preferred mom's...  Which is made from some aged cheddar and havarti and sometime other cheeses depending what we have on hand.  I tried it too and the was very little bacon and no smokiness at all.  For $13 the portion was rather small.  Must have been $11 profit for them... C'mon you could have put more effort into it.  I ordered the honkin beef ribs.  Very tender but as Gordon Ramses would say... Did you taste it... It had not enough seasoning and the didn't give any of the sauce on the side.  I brought it home to fix it... Added a home made BBQ sauce to reheat it.  I give the food 2.5 stars... When I go out I want to be treated to something I can't do at home... Maybe this place is fine for those who can't cook... But even my merger skills felt this place lacked in taste.  Service was good and boost the rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"A lot of variety.    +++++ Cornbread also served warm and fresh  Spinach Dip - Love these with the fried Pita Chips, Good Portion and a lot of cheese :)  Wings - Plump, Juicy and Flavourful  Ribs - You can't go wrong especially when they give you the option AYCE everyday!!!   - - - -  The wait.  There's like 5 tables and there was still a wait on service.  BOO"}
{"text":"Was there last night for dinner with the family and disappointed in the slow service, they ran out of baked potatoes, cold steak, and salty beef brisket.  Definitely will not go back and don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!  My wife and kids love coming here!  Just like the other montanas on great Lakes,   the food and services are better than I expected!   Will go again."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!   Great food and a great environment for the kids.  Try the ribs or the prime rib steak.  So delicious!   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The spinach dip was good. Unfortunately not many gluten free options than the usual salad and chicken or fish, and steak. I got the spinach dip and was quite satisfied however. The break was crispy and soft on the inside and the dip was yummy. The patio is not too bad as well. Much of our order did come incorrectly however. Kid's veggies were kinda gross, and many things were unfortunately overcooked. But on the bright side, our server did everything she could to fix the errors. Overall the experience just wasn't the best.  We had an already long and frustrating day and were hoping to go out to just relax.  To sum up: appetizers are good, steak and kids food was overcooked a bit (ordered medium and received well done steak), service could have been a touch faster only because we let the staff know we're in a rush."}
{"text":"Im really looking for someone to contact here, i was given the name Camelea who was managing. She was the one managing that night and i i refused to speak to her after how i saw her treat her staff. Ive never seen staff treated so badly. I saw her say \"move faster its your problem\" it was burning the girls with all the plates, i wil never come back because of how they treat their staff. We were a large group that day but it is not acceptable"}
{"text":"Called in 2 times to order food for pick up. Someone replied and transfer 2 times to bar tender, waiting 5 min on hold nobody did reply."}
{"text":"On two separate occasions I had walked into this place, and literally had to wait an unreasonable amount of time, until someone came to seat us. I'd say approximately 7-8 minutes. The place wasn't extremely busy,  so there is no excuse. Our waitress seemed to be the only one on shift, as she attended to the other 4 or so tables. I got the all you can eat ribs for $29.99. The pork back ribs that I tried were too dry and was nowhere close to being moist/fall off the bone. Hence, why I stopped after my second rack. A friend of mine had ordered the pulled pork sandwich, and again it was soo dry. I had to use steak sauce in order to get it down my throat. The waitress couldn't understand me properly. It was as if i was speaking some foreign language to her. For my two choices of sides, I had asked for the beans (a long time ago I remember they were soo good) and mashed potatoes. Tell me why I get coleslaw and mashed potatoes. I didn't say anything and was overall just very disappointed."}
{"text":"Restaurant oriented for a night out with the boys and girls catching a playoff game or chilling with friends or even taking the family out. This place has the atmosphere to match. And of course Montana's are known for their ribs and steak. I came here on a Friday night with a friend and I ordered a steak salad plus chorizo poutine to share. The salad was plentiful, so is the chorizo poutine. What's more, both have decent flavouring and that's a plus. The service was decent on a Friday night where the server will check on us every so often to make sure our drinks are topped up or if the food tasted great. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good. Services were super friendly. Clean and warm feeling environment.  Had goat cheese with chicken penne, spinach cheese dip with crispy naan, and crispy chicken. Sorry, I Dont remember the dishes names correctly these aren't the actual names. Overall good food tho!"}
{"text":"I am going to start by prefacing this review by stating the feedback is not on the food quality which was actually decent but the review is entirely my impression of their take-out service.  I called this specific Montana's restaurant to place 15 dinner take-out orders on July 9th @ around 6:30 pm. Spoke to one of their staff on the phone. When I started explaining the orders, I mentioned that this was going to be a large order -- to which she replied that they had just received a large order before my call and if I really wanted to place my order with them. I replied yes (but don't do me any favors)....  When I arrived to pick up the orders, I noticed that they had not written down the order information on the take-out food containers, which would saved me some time instead of having to open up each container and identifying the orders. When I asked their staff to write the down the order information on each food container, she explained rather \"directly\" that \"this was not something that they do\". By that I take it as it is against some Montana's Cookhouse policy to make life easier for their customer, who had just spent close to $300 on dinner.  I tried mentioning this is a rather silly explanation but she was ready to accept my credit card payment and move on with her job -- which obviously does not include writing down the order information (with a Sharpie) on take-out food containers.  If you want to have some decent dinner -- I think Montana's will do. If you want to order take out dinner and have the individual food containers labelled with the order information, go to Kelsey's next door."}
{"text":"So I came with a friend after a movie next door cause we have a craving for BBQ. This location was an obvious choice cause of location.   We were seated quickly and a server came and asked about the drinks situation. This was okay.   Then we ordered our food, my friend and I ordered the summer menu's 7 oz hand carved steak. The food came out not too long after and I noticed my beef wasn't piping hot. I thought Montana's was known for their BBQ steak, I was wrong. Further to this, the cut of beef wasn't the best and so the steak was hard to cut and chewy.   At the end we asked for the bill. Our server was too busy chit chatting with another customer. So the manager came by and helped us instead. So service wasn't great, and the food... Meh."}
{"text":"Happened to come here by chance. Ordered the nachos with beef thinking the pulled pork would be sweet, turns out the beef was sweet too. (Don't like sweet meats). Next we ordered the fire burger, again thinking it would be spicy but it turned out to be sweeter totally over powering the jalapeños and other spicy ingredients.  The server 'Anu' was nice and looked after us. I would recommend coming here but careful if you don't prefer your food a bit sweeter than normal."}
{"text":"Very nice Montana's location. Comfy environment. Waitress was great. Food solid all around. Our table with kids ate: pasta, grilled cheese, potato skins, veggie burger and veggie fajitas."}
{"text":"Took two of my friend's here for their birthdays because they were craving ribs. When choosing this restaurant, we didn't even know that Montana's now offered AYCE ribs, all day, everyday. So naturally, we all opted for this option when it came time to order. For $32.99 you get unlimited sides and ribs. The cornbread was a one time thing though. Any additional request for another is an extra $1. For my first round I chose the coleslaw and veggies as my sides, and the Hot & Honey sauce for my ribs. The veggies were a few pieces of broccoli and cauliflower, with butter. The ribs were juicy and tender. The sauce was sweet and spicy - but not too spicy. For my second round I decided not to get anymore sides, and chose the Chipotle BBQ (I can't remember if this was the exact name). This one was good too, but the Hot & Honey was definitely better. My greedy eyes wanted to go for a third round but I was so stuffed that I eventually let my logic take over and stopped asking for more. I know I can never eat as much as I think, but I'm a sucker for deals and always end up going for them. The food was definitely worth the money. However, I was disappointed that they no longer had fried cheesecake for dessert (or any cheesecake for that matter). The service was also a little slow and we weren't attended to much after our second round, although the waitress did apologize at the end and said they were short-staffed. We weren't really in a rush to leave so it wasn't a big deal at the time. Overall, it was a good experience and I will definitely be back for the ribs!"}
{"text":"Welcoming environment and friendly service.  We ordered the kapow shrimps which are listed as spicy but weren't spicy at all. Calamari was too crispy and i am certain it was previously frozen. Spare rib poutine was delicious but a bit salty. $5 cocktails and beers were a good addition. Our server was friendly and recommended dishes. I will be back just to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"So I was excited to hear that the all you can eat ribs any day promotion was back.  After my last experience I can finally see how this is a scam.  They charge you $3 more than a full rack meal yet when you are served your meal you are only given half rack to start.  I asked the waitress where the rest of my ribs were and she said they only start by giving you a half rack.  No problem so I asked for her to let the kitchen know to start preparing some more ribs seeing as a half rack was finished in like 5 mins.  Shortly after here comes my other half rack.  Needless to say they were a lot smaller than the first.  So I ordered my next batch and when that was brought to our table there was only a quarter rack.  So the rule is they keep bringing you smaller and smaller portions as you keep ordering.  Understood as they do not want any waste.  I was ok with that.  but what i'm not ok with is the quality of the ribs changing.  The ribs were a lot dryer and smaller.  On the first bite I noticed the difference.  To go further on the final quarter rack we received the ribs were so tough and didn't even fall off the bone.  In the end yes its all you can eat ribs but just be prepared for the rules and the quality change of the food."}
{"text":"we checked in late to our hotel (fairfield inn) and wanted to order room service for dinner, but that wasn't available at the hotel.  we drove to the strip mall across and picked montana's cookhouse out of a dozen or so restaurants, not even knowing the type of food the place was serving.  when i found out that montana's cookhouse is equivalent to lucille's or wood ranch in u.s., i was relieved and excited to have \"authentic/traditional\" american cuisine.  the menu mainly consists of all things related to bbq and southern comfort food along with the usual burger and sandwich items you see on chain restaurants.  my coworker and i ordered a couple of appetizers and decided to share a large pork back ribs with texas bold sauce upon the server's recommendation.  the calamari and shrimp appetizers were okay, but quite expensive for the portion size.  the menu description made them sound so much better than what they really were.  the pork ribs, on the other hand, surpassed my expectations.  the meat was tender and the sauce was flavorful with spicy kick to it.  I also loved the cornbread, although some might say it is too sweet and cakey.  i admit that the food probably tasted better because i was starving, but i would go back to montana's for reliability and predictability."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lovely patio, and the kids meal options were impressive. However we were not to pleased with the food quality and everything seemed to be slightly overlooked, from The kids pizzas to the steak, baked potatoes  and the coleslaw was off. The waitress was willing to help out, but as usual we were in a hurry to head out and could not stay to have our meals replaced. Might give it another try..."}
{"text":"Had a good time with our friends, we all enjoyed our dinners and drinks, the kids meals were well priced and the actually ate. The portions were all good, except my gluten free dish, it seemed to be half the size in person, compared to the picture. But other wise it tasted very good. We were a little bit unpleased by the end, once were all done eating, our table wasn't cleaned at all, and we including our children were eating dessert at a very messy and dirty table full of empty plates.... Other wise the service was fair, the food was good and priced well.  Bonus: they provide scene points!"}
{"text":"Very good service albeit slow.  Very busy though so all in all a good experience.  Pot roast soup is always great."}
{"text":"My daughter desperately wanted to go to Montana's for the end of school dinner. Erika was a fun,  friendly server. The food  was exactly as expected. In short,  Montana's was exactly what you would expect from Montana's."}
{"text":"Awful experience at this location! Super slow service with food not coming out at the same time. Dry, over salted meat that was left out too long and chicken fingers that honestly looked as though they were cut in half- will not be back"}
{"text":"The Manu has changed, there's no grilled chicken anymore, the ribs are dry and not falling off the bone and very little sauce. They used to have such good ribs but has gone downhill. The menu does not look appetizing, there isn't a lot to choose from"}
{"text":"Nothing too special here except the fact that my food look ant size compared to the menu.... Ive been to a montanas in Vaughn and the portions matched the menu size so I dont know what happened at this location.   Staff was friendly and didn't have to wait for a table at 7:00pm on a sunday night."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch this afternoon. Their claim to fame is that they will prepare your lunch in 15 minutes ! (Ooooooh Ahhhhhhhh)  Food was a-ok. We ordered the platter. For $12.99, we got a mixture of apps including potato skins, garlic cheese bread, and Montana's spinach dip.  Service was ok. It took a while for the server to come to our table, but after she noticed us, the service improved drastically. We got refills on our drinks without even having to ask. That's impressive.  I'm not going to go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area I'll come back."}
{"text":"Worst service possible! Food was completely cold, waiter ignored us for 2 hours and we ended up wasting half of our Sunday here! Manager was nice not rude but only gave us 20% off our bill which came out to $6 for 2 hours of our wasted time and they still had the nerve to charge us for the extra peice of bread they gave us to eat while we waited an hour and a half for our food to be ready!!! Writing this review as I'm still sitting at my booth currently waiting another 20 mins to pay our bill. What a joke. Will NEVER EVER come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke honestly. The customer service is big time joke, and I would recommend everyone stay away from here with their rude waitresses. I made the absolute ridiculous mistake of coming back here again. I truly regret that. Very rude waitstaff with absolutely no understanding on how to be polite. I think a true testament of a places management is how the waitstaff behaves, and for how long this problem has been existing. I wrote a bad review about them five months ago....somebody actually contacted me through private messaging and nothing came out of it and there was absolutely no follow up from them. Cara food group or whatever they are called, needs to take a look at this airport location and make a change immediately. This place is garbage save your money spend it somewhere where they appreciate it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night and it was busy. Took 30 minutes to get a table and another 30 minutes for the waitress to take our order. We couldn't get her attention to order drinks and when we asked someone else they told us to wait for our waitress.   We ordered the rib and sausage meal it was good. The ribs was really good the meat fell off the bone and the sausage had a nice kick to it. Overall the food is worth coming for but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! I ordered their famous ribs and were awesome. My wife had a burger and was great too. Totally recommended"}
{"text":"We came here with a few friends on a Friday night.  The place was packed as expected which was why we made a reservation.  We got seated promptly while we waited for the rest of our group.  We ordered after our entire group arrived. While waiting for our food, i noticed that the server was quite apologetic to the people at a neighbouring table as they were leaving.  However I couldn't quite catch the reason for his apologies.  Perhaps the reason was the time it took for the food to be ready because for us it must have waited for at least 45 minutes before ours arrived.  It was clear that the kitchen was understaffed.  This also resulted in the long line up of people waiting for a table at the door... you won't get good turnover of tables if people take 2 hours to eat their meals because of the long wait.    As for the food when it finally came, the brisket burger that I ordered was mediocre at best.  The meat was dry and they actually served it on a sandwich bun not a burger bun, plus there was no other toppings... just bun and meat.  I believe there should have been onions in it but nope!  Oh by the way,  the reason that I ended up ordering the burger was that they did not have any beef ribs that night.  I don't know how that can be allowed to happen but it did.  Someone really messed up on the ordering front at Montana's.  FYI, Montana's is known for it steak and ribs so not having any beef ribs on one of your busiest nights is not acceptable.  The burger that I ended up ordering is 1/2 the price of the beef rib plate that I would have ordered.  If I am the owner, I would have been really mad that this was allowed to happen.  The service was acceptable but it definitely does not make up for the long wait for mediocre food.  Will I be back to this location?  Probably not for a long while unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and her son for dinner.    Ordered Baked Chicken Penne  off of the Pasta section in the menu.   I think it was around 15$ for a pile of pasta with cheese, tomato sauce, somewhat non existent chicken and 2 slices of garlic bread. Tasted like a meal under $10 brought to you in a fancy skillet.    Didn't end up finishing it as I was full from the appetizer that the three of us shared.    The root beer and vanilla smoothie was okay, nothing to really talk about as I've had it a few times in my life.    Server was nice enough and very attentive.  Food was average.     Just a little shocking that they charge that much for second rate pasta.  Tasted like something I could've made at home with a can of tomato sauce.  Probably cost them under $5 to make it to be honest.    Cost around $90.00 for 3 people to have a drink each with one appetizer and a meal per person."}
{"text":"We came here to watch a game, and we decided to call ahead to make sure there was seating available. The girl we spoke to over the phone seemed a bit out of the loop...with the happenings and sounded very confused when we asked about the game. When we got there it was barely full, and we sat at the bar. I can't say the food was amazing, and the service was outstanding either. We ordered a brisket sample platter, a stuffed baked potato, and a burger. The food came out really slow, and we noticed that the waitress walking around with our food and approaching other customers with the food. They would shake their heads and say no we didn't order that. On she goes walking around again, approaching another table and getting the same answer. This goes on for a good 10 mins, at this point our food is cold. We also see there is a major lack of communication between the waitress' bringing out the food and the ones punching in the orders. In the end, for the price of the food to the quality I would say is 'OK'. The service and the waiting definitely did not help either, but we would still come back as a last option for future game watching."}
{"text":"Montana's is eh. Kinda just mediocre. Service is usually pretty nice. The food is good not amazing but good. I like their baby back ribs the most because they pull of the bone nicely."}
{"text":"The firecracker burger with Caesar salad is amazing!! Juicy beef burger and onion pieces are crispy and delicious a hint of spicy bbq sauce. The best burger I've been tasted. We even have order the beef nacho, so good!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and the service. Sarah has been are server a couple of times and tall young guy kevin. Not sure if he still there! I always go to Queensway Montana's for dinner."}
{"text":"Had a craving for meat...so I decided to go for their all you can eat ribs. New menu, more choices and family friendly. Started off with their craft beer Flying monkey . Wings were meaty and tasty appetizer. I ordered the steak instead of the ribs because the wings kinda filled me up. Ordered it blue rare. Came as ordered. Side of quinoa and salad. Over all good. But not spectacular. Solid 3 stars.    Note- This review is solely the opinion of the reviewer and NOT the opinion of Yelp or any of its staff."}
{"text":"Can't say I had any expectations, as the food at all Montana's locations has turned mediocre years ago.   This one is no exception, and you get your portion of bland, covered in bland, with a side of bland.   The only reasons for the 3 star rating is the friendliness of the staff, and their attempts at making your experience as pleasant as possible.   Won't repeat if I don't have to."}
{"text":"I filled out a survey from their reciept after the last time about the poor experience we had. A few days later the manager from this location gave me a call to discuss the dinner and the issues.  She was very professional and seemed genuinely apologetic. She also offered to send my family a $50 gift letter to make it up to us,  she said she wanted us to come back and realize that last time want a regular thing.   So we went back tonight and had a much better experience.  The service was still good,  just like last time.  I'm glad they didn't act differently after we gave or server the letter.  The food came out nice and hot and my sister, her wife and all enjoyed our meals.   The manager stopped by the table a few times and checked in on us. Over all the experience was great. The table behind us had a small issue and the manager also took 20% of their bill.  Our dinner was under 1.5 hours and the restaurant seemed busier than last time.  We were very satisfied!   Fajitas were good enough for 2 people,  chicken tacos looked fresh and they have several different types of meat and toppings for the burgers.  Although the bun had a word after taste for me.   Tip join their online community for a free appetizer!"}
{"text":"4 stars?!?! I know Bramptonites are idiots with no standards but this solidifies it!  The service here is great but the food is so average-chain-resto-cardboard that you'd have to have spent a year in the desert (or Brampton) to find it tasty.  That said, if you think chain food is good you'll love it here. If you have standards though, you most surely will not."}
{"text":"I'll make this short as everyone else seems to have already touched on the issues here.  First off, the food is quite decent, and (depending on what you order) quite tasty.  Second, the wait times are horrendous.  From the hour and a half it took to seat a group of six, on a Sunday night, with half of the restaurant empty, to the extra hour and fifteen minutes it took to get our food from the time ordered, there was no communication from our waitress.  When we were finally able to find her, we were told \"the food is ready now\", fifteen minutes later, they were \"plating it now\", it took another fifteen minutes for it to arrive at the table, and then it still took them yet another fifteen more minutes for everyone to get their order.  Drink orders were slow, we had to send out search parties in order to get refills, and most infuriating, groups who had arrived after us were receiving their food orders before us.  The cherry on top of this all?  We didn't even get a half-hearted apology!"}
{"text":"Good barbecue fare, cold beer, great service. Nice place to slow down for an evening. I have eaten at Montana's in many locations and the food is consistently good, especially the funds, pulled pork but even the steaks have always been excellent. It is nice to see a chain that delivers consistently and seems to care about quality."}
{"text":"Typical chain food. Had the Cobb salad you really can't go wrong with salad. Server was very prompt and friendly. As I am gluten free she was very knowledgeable about what would be okay for me to eat. I would go again ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this experience a lot. My family of 4 enjoyed their late Father's Day celebration. We wanted a booth after we were seated and they were very accommodating. Loved the service, the food, and the waitress was also really great. Will recommend!"}
{"text":"This will be a short and sweet (literally) review. We came here for dessert, random I know. We had a free Birthday dessert, the Jays just lost the playoff game we were at so we wanted to drown our sorrows in sugar. We got the doughnuts. Holy Moly! I had, lets say, mediocre expectations for them, and they proved me wrong!!! These are so delicious!! They have a crispy cream texture inside, a slight crunch outside, powdered sugar and caramel dip! Yeah, you want something sweet, this is a great random dessert destination."}
{"text":"Apparently;y things have changed at this Montanas! Starting in January 2015 they started smoking the ribs on site instead of serving product from a central commissary. I don't know how it happens, but these were the meatiest ribs I have ver consumed, lots of meat to bone ratio, and pretty damn tasty too. The cornbread has shrunk 50% in size, which is fine because its below mediocre. Thje coleslaw is great, because its been around a few days, letting the dressing break down the cabbage. The loaded baled potato is  fantastic and  HUGE.Don't bother with the all you can eat price. One rack of ribs will more than fill you up.!"}
{"text":"We came to Montana's before seeing a film; after the last time, I've been to Montana's one before. The service has definitely improved and appears to be more attentive. Both time, I've had the special 'Nashville Chicken' which was good both times. I especially appreciated that when I mentioned we were seeing a film, our server, Claire, mentioned we could purchase a few movie tickets. So based on the improved service and consistent quality of food for a good price. The rating of 4 stars from 2 is well deserved."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Went here for a family dinner on a Sunday night. Our food took nearly an hour to be brought out from the time we ordered it, even though there seemed to be enough wait staff attending to tables. Also, my pulled pork sandwich came up pretty short on taste."}
{"text":"Tough to find much good to say about dry, chewy ribs.  The various BBQ sauces were good, however, and there was a bottle of each at the table, so I could try the variety.  However, none of them were able to impart some moisture into the ribs.  That's really a shame, since ribs are often a premium meal for many of us, so it is disappointing to spend that kind of coin on a fail.  But the sides, and cornbread were pretty good, and the server was outstanding. And 400 feet away are dozens of other restaurants to step into the breach..."}
{"text":"I gotta stop this. I keep coming back once a year to see if anything has improved.  I usually see some new signature items on the menu, but they never seem to get it over the finish line.  This time it was the Chipotle Firecracker Burger with bacon, cajun onions, melted cheese, crispy jalapeños and sweet BBQ sauce.  All of the toppings were reasonably flat, and the burger itself was a dry puck. With a soft drink you are at $20.  For $20, there are infinitely better choices from The Works, South Street, even 5 Guys, and that does not begin to factor in the drive down to the Burger's Priest or Holy Chuck.  Frank Zappa said it best:  \"Goin' to Montana soon-gonna be a dental floss tycoon...\""}
{"text":"Me and my family decided to go here for Father's Day which turned out to be a very big mistake!   Not only my family and me had to wait over an hour for food but when we actually got food, it was cold and gross! My 10 oz steak didn't really have much flavour and fries weren't crispy.  My mom had a steak burrito bowl and she said it the steak dry and over cooked and it was replaced the the fajita skillet which she tasted okay but wasn't the best.  My dad had some meat plate and he said the meat was cold and gross.  Lastly, my sister also said it was cold and it wasn't the best burger she had.  Fortunately, we got half food free of charge but honestly we should for free! I'm praying I don't get food poisoning later!   The one star is for the waitress who was understanding it wasn't her fault! :(   It's safe to say we won't be back ever again! There's better and faster service with good food!"}
{"text":"Can't expect amazing food but service was top notch.  We waited a little long for food but we were there with a group for a bday."}
{"text":"food is ok. crayon is fun. still love their deep fried cheesecake!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????hwy?????????????????????????????d?????????????????????medium,?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Food can be a bit dry. Service is hit or miss. However if you get Lori prepare for the best service you can get! All you can eat ribs are back and it's we'll worth the price if you will eat a second rack of 6. Drinks are pretty good for a big name eating establishment."}
{"text":"To anyone who is looking for an informal, low pressure meeting place I recommend this Montana's. I've gone here 4-6 times already (this was the first time strictly for business) and with a group of 6, I'd say we had no/little complaints.  Had an informal business meeting here when my plan A fell through. The staff was very accommodating and the Ribs are as good as always.   When I sat down, I was a bit leary it might be too loud to do my presentation or perhaps, too distracting. Though we were sitting in the middle area of the venue it was just the right amount of ambient noise to enable a public privacy.   Actually the only thing that interrupted us was the Staff surprise commotions that happened twice during the course of the evening (like singing Happy Birthday or whatever it was). Of course, the fact I can't remember what they were singing/saying is testament to how it easy it was to ignore.   Montana's is basically a staple for me, and this location is one of the reasons I keep coming back. I also feel like saying to those people whose reviews I read (with 1-2 stars): manage your expectations. If you want to be wowed, go elsewhere. I just know I can count on the same experience every-time, and I like that consistency.  * - Good value proposition, * - Tasty options, * - Professional service, * - Dependable. (missing star for creativity/\"wow\", perhaps it's because I've gone there so many times)  4/5"}
{"text":"First the bad food is always below average at this location. Food here is either under cooked or over cooked. The good is the service everyone's friendly and attend to your needs with a smile."}
{"text":"Slowest service of all time!!!! I was tempted to eat the condiments at the table because I was so hungry while waiting 45 minutes for my food to come after waiting 20 min to be seated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner about 8:30 on a Monday. Our party of 3 were seated in a bar booth. Looked like 4 other tables in the restaurant.  At the time we heard our waitress(bartender) say \"I can't believe they stiffed me).  Didn't seem relevant at the time but it soon became clear why they stuffed her.  Here is a timeline of our experience 15 to see our waitress (bartender) 15 to get our drinks Walked to the bar for second beer 20 minutes for food Waitress came back 15 minutes after we were done  She finally came and just brought the check. When paying we realized she automatically put a 20% gratuity on the check. Guess she was worried about being stiffed again.  All in all the food was OK, about what I would expect but the service ruined it."}
{"text":"The consistency of a chain and the usual good food of Montana's. Most famous for ribs, with AYCE on Wednesdays, the chicken is also good but a better steak can be had at a steakhouse. This location is a good as any other."}
{"text":"Well, I've given this place so many chances and I just wish they could bring the food out hot and fresh.  There are certain items on the menu that keep us going back, such as their burgers, but it would be nice to have it hot and the sides nice and hot too.  We still go hoping for a change!"}
{"text":"Was the worst experience. I ordered steak medium well done, when the food came it was charcoaled black and extremely well done. It was tougher than leather.  My son in law ordered a steak medium cooked, one end of the steak was well done the other end was rare, bright red.  Also a tough piece of meat.  It's not like the prices are cheap, the bill was quite high at the end of the night.  A very disappointing night, but one we will not forget."}
{"text":"This location's food is really good for when you want to step it up from Boston Pizza or Earls.. their service however, is horrible!   Their servers are absolutely the slowest and least professional I've encountered in YYC. I'm sorry to say that because of this location's bad servers (it's not just one), we don't come here anymore which is a shame!  Excellent customer service should be a No.1 priority and goal at any restaurant. Hoping to return to Montana's in a year and see a positive change!"}
{"text":"So I haven't been to a Montanas in probably close to 5 years, no particular reason, just never really had a desire to go.  Last night a few of us decided to visit this particular restaurant because of the great patio.  Our host (which I'm pretty sure was the manager) led us to a table outside promptly. When our server didn't approach for 10 minutes, I knew it wasn't gonna be a good service night.  The menu is quite big with a lot of options available, from veggie to meat lovers. I ordered the pulled pork which comes on a long panini bun, and a house salad.  What may be my mistake when ordering, I assumed that the sauce listed next to the sandwich was the sauce you got not that you had to specifically ASK for sauce on a pulled pork sandwich. Needless to say, my sandwich was a dry pulled pork with practically no taste. My salad was also COATED in dressing, which is not how I enjoy salad.  The only food that I actually enjoyed was the potato skins which were delicious.  Our sever was absentee, only checking in on us periodically, which ultimately meant several of our group had no drinks refilled, had to flag her down to get ketchup on the table. She didn't seem to be particularly happy to be working on a long weekend.  Bad taste left in my mouth from the shoddy service.  Perhaps another visit with a different server will make for a better time.  P.s There should really be a better option for redeeming scene points coupons/receiving points instead of taking both the customer's phone and scene card away from the table to \"the back\" to get the bonus points. I don't feel comfortable giving my phone to a stranger.  1.5/5"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars for amazing customer service! After my previous review, I was contacted by Cara food services in a Yelp message and was put in touch with the manager of this location, Michelle. We were asked to come back for another meal on the house to make up for the last visit.   I have to say, Michelle and the staff went out of their way to ensure that we were tended to, and we had a much, much better experience.   My partner had the all you-can-eat ribs and I had a chicken sandwich. We were both very happy with our food and the service was excellent.   I am impressed that they reached out to me after I posted my last review, and absolutely did their best to rectify the situation. Based on this experience, I would recommend giving them a try--Just avoid the 7oz hand carved steak! Lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I went back here because of the great meal we enjoyed last year on this same date.  What a difference! What a letdown!  When we arrived, they had no record of the reservation I had made last week. It took quite a while to get a table, then waited for the server. We ordered an appetizer and we both had the steak bites and baked potato.  We never did get the appetizer and when the meal arrived, the food was cold. My husband's was warm, and because he is diabetic, he ate his. Mine was too cold to eat and I sent it back. The manager did give us a complementary appetizer and had my meal redone, complementary. This time it was hot.  This will be the last time we go to Montana's, at least this location.  Not a nice birthday meal experience."}
{"text":"I came here on a monday after work. There were maybe 6 or 7 people in the whole place so i thought i would get my food quickly. Boy was i wrong... it took me 15 minutes to even order after the waitress saying \"ill be right with you\". After i ordered a basic burger i was in for a 25 minute wait just to get my food.... in an empty place this is far too long. One of the waitresses was constantly texting on her phone and giving the other waitresses attitude. The food is sub par and overpriced. Big mistake coming here, waste of time and money. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to these type of restaurants (chains)...but it was for a birthday so not much choice. The food here is horrible. Ribs were dry...and tasted like came out of the freezer from your local no frills or food basics. Also tried the poutine, nachos, and BBQ chicken. None of the food tasted like it was smoked or made from scratch...and the prices were pretty inflated for such low quality food. I guess they have to charge a lot to pay for the decor. At more than $30/person, I could have done groceries and come up with much better and tastier food. I wouldn't go back if I was given a free meal ticket."}
{"text":"Montana's is an alright place for Canadian BBQ.  Being a restaurant that focuses on steaks and ribs, you would assume that they have become quite good at cooking them. Unfortunately, this is not the case at Montana's. When I was there last, they did not even have any beef ribs as they had sold out of them. Instead I got the rib eye steak which was a very poor cut of meat. The steak itself was cooked to my preference but the fat was impossible to cut through with the very dull steak knife I was provided. Some of the people I was with got the pork ribs and found them to be extremely dry and cold when served. The restaurant was busy, but they also took far longer than they should have to cook the food. The service was also quite spotty but good when they around. I don't understand why the prices are so high in Montana's in comparison to similar restaurants. Paying nearly $30 for a meal has me expecting far better quality than what they serve.  Go for the beef ribs if they have them but don't bother with the high priced steaks."}
{"text":"**3.5 Stars**  The food here is typical Montana's; you won't find anything different here. Just take precooked stuff and heat it up. Doesn't mean it's going to taste \"bad\" it's just not great. I wouldn't come here for the food, but more when I'm meeting a big group of friends and we want to go somewhere close to home. I have to say that their desserts are pretty good though, really big and tasty.  Service here is decent, most times pretty slow, but this is not a place you're going to be in a rush at anyways.  If you take someone to have their birthday here don't forget to let the waiter/waitress know, and the birthday guy/gal will get a free dessert as well as a funny birthday song wearing a ridiculous humongous bull cap thingamajig."}
{"text":"Out of pretty much every mixer for their drinks.  Food was actually cold when it got out to us... Brought out dirty wine glasses that were actually sticky... not once but twice. Server was a sweetheart, but pretty unremarkable service. Expected a bit more from this location but it fell short... it's the first time I have had a bad experience at a Montanas."}
{"text":"We wen't for my birthday and I was not too impressed. First we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, not bad for a Friday night...but we ended up waiting for over and hour watching people who came in after us get seated!?! We asked if they took reservations or something and one server said no while another said yes...when we finally did get seated it was in some random corner at a HUGE table. Our server greeted us kindly and apologised for the wait offering to take our order right away because she knew the kitchen was backed up.We thought that was very kind. I ordered a pasta with tomato sauce that ended up being more like pasta and cut up tomatoes! It was super spicy and not even a sauce! For dessert we shared the Nutella Waffles which were SO AMAZING!   Usually I LOVE this place because of the atmosphere, food and service. This location seems to be lacking but I would recommend this restaurant...just not this location."}
{"text":"Wow is my only word !  I love montanas but this location is well in terrible need of more staff and customer service skills ! 2 of us walk in this evening to get a bar area seat for a few drinks and some appetizers .. There's 2 empty seats however they are full of garbage so we wait around for a waitress to ask if we can sit there and or clean one for us .... Nothing ..we wait and wait so finally I ask the waitress so you mind if we sit here ?  Go ahead she says .. So we sit and wait for the table to be cleaned and wait to have a drink ... 10 mins go by and she doesn't come ... Finally we see her and she walks our way ... But no she goes to the table 2 tables over and starts talking and talking and we wait and wait  Yea another 5 mins go by of her talking ... So we finally get up and walk out . And walk by her and nothing !! What a shame !"}
{"text":"This particular location is actually very decent ! The service is always pleasant and very prompt ! The food is generally fresh and good ! The ribs are alwsy very tasty and the antojitos are definitely one great appetizer to try!  Great deals on beers ! And a great spot to catch the game at the bar !"}
{"text":"B - List - Good food. Good service. Ask for crayons to draw on the butcher paper laying on the table. How's that for fun."}
{"text":"Too bad can't rate less than one star. Walked in seemed like we bothered the hostess not a smile, not a welcome to Montana's. Waited 20 minutes no one came to the table we left never going back"}
{"text":"I went with the family, the service was fast and the food was delicious and as expected, we got extra tortillas for the fajitas without asking, Nestani who served us was awesome and the kids liked her"}
{"text":"The beef rib was dry and flavorless. The only part that was tender was they see-cooked  fat which should have been crispy. The \"Texas Bold\" BBQ sauce was anything but bold. The mashed potatoes were soggy, the gravy sour. The only thing decent was the generic cole slaw.  The service was okay: the waitress actually checked in on me. Fortunately I wasn't too hungry so not finishing was not too big a disappointment. Two stars for the cole slaw and the service."}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened to this place. It used to be one of our family favorites. Last nite when we went there it was an odd experience. First, only about 1/2 the restaurant was being used. Our server was less than attentive and the food was a big disappointment. My son ordered chicken wings and they were still frozen in the middle. I had beef that was dry and my husbands burger was burnt. We will not go to Montanas again."}
{"text":"Damn good ribs. Staff is very friendly and accommodating, especially when you're in a party full of kids. I'm usually against taking kids to restaurants, but I make an exception for their ribs."}
{"text":"My first and LAST time at this location. We ordered chimichurri steak and chicken tacos. The steak was very rubbery and essentially tasteless. They didn't grill the tortillas for tacos so it just tasted raw and the filling wasn't good either. The Caesar salad was just lettuce with store bought dressing (and not the best dressing). We did not finish our food.  The drinks were ok except the Caesar  (it was just pepper with ice!). We paid $40 each for the crappy dinner. I will NOT RETURN to this place"}
{"text":"Meh, childrens chicken fingers are really the size of kid's fingers. Over fried also. Burgers and fries incredibly salty. Side of waffle fries only included 4 small pieces. Everything definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. First we got there early to get a good table to watch Super Bowl. We went for the All You Can Eat Ribs which they claimed was going to be available during the super bowl. First, we had to call our waitress every time. She never came to asked us if we needed anything. Second, it was not even 2 minutes into the game, and someone else comes and tells us that they just ran out of Ribs. I would have understand this, if the place was packed, but the place was not even 1/4 full. I guess that should have tipped us off. Last but not least, they had the game on several screens, but 3 of the tvs were on a channel that was ahead 10 seconds. We asked them politely to please put all the TVs on the same channel and they were like \"um. I don't know. Let me see if the manager can switch channels\". Just terrible. Will never come back."}
{"text":"No, no, no, no.  Terrible manager, he is very condescending, cheap and has absolutely NO sense of customer service. Some of the waitresses are terrible as well. Definitely NOT getting my service again and EVERYONE that I know will also be told to steer clear."}
{"text":"Ordered the Steak and Rib combo here last week.  If this sounds like something you'd want to eat, I'd do it here.  It was way better than I expected.  Steak was as good as you'd get in any other place that does primarily steaks.  Ribs were moist and nearly fall off the bone.  Sauce..yum.   Service was adequate, but nothing special.  Went with good company so combined with the food, it made it a really fun and memorable night out. I don't always like chain restaurants, but don't see a reason why we wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"If you are visiting from the West Coast and you have to go out for dinner in Brampton, 90% chance it will have to be a franchise. . .   I recommend Montana's:  the menu is varied enough for all age groups - including kids and seniors - large and small appetites.  It's more affordable (over The Keg, Mandarin and Red Lobster) and the past five+ years I've come here the food has been consistent and service has been friendly and timely.      The bbq baby back ribs dinner ($20.99 3/4 rack) is my go-to with lots of choice:  5 bbq sauces (apple butter - mmmm); beans, corn or coleslaw; and one of eight sides (they do a well loaded baked potato), plus warm cornbread.  The desserts are fun, but best shared given their size, calories, and price.  The Kraft paper table cover is great for doodling, which in turn is good for games and conversation. Montana's should provide sharp, good quality crayons, instead of the dull, broken nubs in a cup."}
{"text":"Waiter was lowkey judging us lol; food tasted weird. meh, overpriced only went here cause I was hungry and there was nothing else around for me to eat"}
{"text":"Their food has really taken a turn for the worst. I do not want to get into details but the ribs were lukewarm ... and we ordered the 'nicest and most tender' - obviously most expensive rack o'ribs!  Staff were ... 'Meh I've experienced better.\"  Their servings are 'Texan' size! Which is what got them their second star but ... does it really matter it's a big plate when the food is not that good? Hmmm ..."}
{"text":"Their food is definitely better here than at their other locations.  Staff are friendly, service is quick.  Their servings are 'Texan' size!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Left a little disappointed because I wanted to redeem as many scene points as I could on my bill. The waitress told me i could only redeem a maximum of  $30 worth but I found out that was not true. I'm not sure if she was lying because she was worried about not getting a proper tip (i would never short change her) or she was improperly trained on the scene program. If I knew that I was only able to redeem 3,000 points, I would have ordered less food. Scene is a huge part of Montana's as well as other restaurants. I feel like the staff should be more aware of how to redeem points. They always have to jump through hoops just to process the scene points."}
{"text":"I go to Montana's mainly for the steak, and I've never been disappointed. Although it is a chain restaurant, the food and service are quite good. It has a down-to-earth western theme that I genuinely like, unlike the more upscale (and expensive) steakhouses like The Keg, Ruth's Chris, Black Angus, etc. You go to Montana's because you like meat, not because you like to dress up and spend three figures.   I have been to this location several times over the years. I usually order my steak medium or medium-well because I like it cooked but still juicy. Last time, I had it with side orders of fries and baked beans; it was delicious, and I would go there again.   If you want a decent steak at a reasonable price, you may want to check this place out."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Montana's many times over the years, though it's been awhile since I've been back. When we went today, I ordered my favorite, pork back ribs. They are advertised as 'fall off the bone' tender. Unfortunately, the ribs I was served were anything but, They were tough! It took every bit of the large steak knife just to cut between the bones. And rather than fall off, it was literally necessary to gnaw the meat off the bones. The waitress informed me that they had recently changed their preparation method. My advice to management? Change back!! These were quite literally the worst ribs I have had in Calgary across many restaurants.  Other than my ribs, my wife said her Bison Burger was tasteless and the bun stone cold - not just un-warmed, but literally pulled from a fridge cold.   The food this time only rated one star. The second star was for the attentive service of our waitress, whose tip unfortunately was minimal due to the poor food."}
{"text":"Not very busy but was perfect for a \"date\" atmosphere. Our server wasn't the greatest because the restaurant was closing and they were putting up the chairs but no one told us. The server guy just gave us the cheque and didn't tell us the place was closing. When we left, all the staff were in the back. Good place for a quiet date and the food was ok. Desert is kind of sweet though."}
{"text":"Service is always slow and their ribs are not so good anymore, there was a time that the meat was soft and you easily separate the meat from the bones, last time I were there the meat was hard and undercooked."}
{"text":"Food is great, especially the baked potato with the works.  Service can be lackluster, it was ok at the beginning but at the end it just dropped.  Asked if I could get small sauces for my leftovers, apparently it was a big deal when i asked if I could get new gravy, sour cream (mine had been used and had food in it).  Based on service I wouldn't want to come back no mater how good food is."}
{"text":"I see a lot of comments that parallel my experience. Firstly, the food is ok. They have plenty of Beer choices and a good bar. The staff, on the other hand, can vary drastically, the server on one night was great, and we were tended to very efficiently, but the next night, we could get any attention, and it just seemed like we were a bother to be served. Asking for the bill was a challenge, then paying, was another. We started nicknaming the place Non-Tanas, as in Non-service oriented place. We have not been back since."}
{"text":"Came here after work with colleagues. Ordered Jambalaya spaghetti. Came with garlic bread. Overall spaghetti was good in terms of taste. Had shrimp, chicken and sausage in it. However it looked like the chicken were breaded chicken as opposed to real chicken. Service was slow. The waitress was friendly but took them forever to bring out the food."}
{"text":"This location has been a staple of SE Calgary and is always consistent.   The restaurant has not changed with quarter set aside for the bar side that has full service menu with lots of TVs.   The dining area has all the outdoor decor you expect with animal heads on the walls along with an assortment of outdoor equipment ie canoes.   The food is good and portions are nice. Staff are friendly and quick.   Overall if you enjoy meats like ribs and burgers this is the place!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place at all.  Yup, it's a chain, yup it's in a mall, and the patio is fenced in and overlooks the parking lot of the Queensway Cinema (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cineplex-odeon-queensway-etobicoke).  But it's not bad at all.  If you fancy franchised food or a quick bite prior to or post-film, you can do worse.  The food is decently fresh, the staff is diligent and efficient, and bordering on coolish, but you'd probably be somewhat standoffish when dealing with the yobbos who are looking for a bite to eat after having sat through \"Meet Dave\".  The food is served decently promptly and the prices are not out of line with the portions that you get.  It's a Montana's.  You get decent ribs, adequate sides, and an experience not unlike most other cinemas.  Of the options that present themselves as you leave the theatre, it may not be your first choice, but it's probably the lesser of several evils."}
{"text":"I went to Montana's a couple of weeks ago for my friend's birthday and I think I still have nightmares about that horrid night.  Situated in a plaza merely a short bus ride or a fifteen minute walk away from Scarborough Town Centre, this place seemed like a decent dinner getaway after a day of shopping without having to see a gigantic Walmart sign every time you look out the window.  Or so I thought.  We had reservations at 8:30 for a party of about 20 people.  Now because we were such a large group, I did not expect five star service, but I was still hoping for a nice meal.  Perhaps I was asking for too much.  The night began to go downhill within minutes of our arrival.  We arrived on time, but were told that there would be a short wait.  Although most of us were starved, we patiently waited in the cold for 20 minutes until they finally had space for about half of us.  We went in and were seated and greeted by our server as we waited for the remaining members of our party, who were still outside.  We were given water in jugs and mason jars as cups.  The mason jars were a unique touch and definitely added to the camping-outdoorsy atmosphere of the restaurant.  We sat patiently for another half hour until everyone was finally seated.  Now an hour's wait may have been reasonable if we dropped in without reservations, but we called days in advance.  Nevertheless, we were still optimistic and even excited about finally getting to eat dinner.  The waiter apologized to us for the wait and took our orders.  When we asked when the food was going to be ready, she said that the kitchen was not prepared for such a large group to drop-in.  Again, understandable if we did not make reservations, but they knew for days that a large group was coming in.  It took another hour for the food to finally come.  We were getting restless.  It was now 10:30 and we were all starved.  As far as service goes, the last straw was when the food began to come.  Multiple people were missing their food and the waitress kept insisting we ordered something we did not and began to get angry when no one would take the plate.  I ordered the four cheese spinach dip as a starter and goat cheese penne as the main.  The spinach dip was delicious.  Although a bit too creamy, the spinach and feta cheese made up for it.  It came with so many crispy pita chips that if I were eating it alone, I wouldn't be able to finish.  If you're willing to put up with the service, the four cheese spinach dip is a must try.  The goat cheese penne was not what I expected.  Contrary to the absolutely delicious spinach dip, the pasta was mediocre.  The only thing that saved the bland tasting pasta sauce was the goat cheese.  In the middle of our meal, the manager came and spoke with us and apologized for the wait.  She offered us 6-7 desserts on the house to compensate for the poor service.  For a group of over 20, 6-7 desserts was not enough, but we were all feeling fed up and just wanted to leave, so no one was tremendously eager in satisfying their sweet tooth.  The desserts took over half an hour to come, but by then no one cared.  All we wanted to do was leave.  I had a bite of the decadent tortilla cheesecake for dessert.  Fair warning, this cheesecake looks nothing like you would imagined it to be.  Maybe it's because I've been eating pretty much only New York cheesecakes my whole life and had never seen a tortilla cheesecake, but when it was first brought to the table, I had no idea what it was.  It bears no resemblance to \"ordinary\" cheesecake.  It can be described as looking like a deep fried tortilla with a lousy excuse for cheesecake on the inside.  It also tastes as unappetizing as it sounds.  Overall, the food was tolerable, but not worth the price and lousy service.  I have been to cheaper places with big groups and the food and service at Montana's does not even begin to compare.  It's safe to say that you will never see me in Montana's ever again."}
{"text":"Food sucked, and service was even worse. If you want to have a good time, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Originally wanted to eat at Jack Astors in Richmond Hill, due to limited parking a friend and I decided to eat at Montana's because it's close by. Service was amazing, they kept making sure everything was alright.   The food was average. Had the Canadian Eh burger. It didn't have any unique features, just a normal burger.   I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend but if you're really hungry... There's tons of parking.  3/5"}
{"text":"Well Montanas thanks for redeeming yourself!  Tonight we arrived to a packed restaurant at 605pm.  We found a nice booth in the bar side.  Within 5 minutes we had drinks in front of us and our food order was soon taken.  Food came out hot and fresh and was delish.  The wonderful young lady server, forgot her name, was delightful.  Service was amazing considering how busy it was tonight..... so different from last visit.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"very cozy restaurant service for the most part is attentive, food is great, great sandwhiches and burgers, good appetizers( antojitos are delicious, so are the calamari with spicy mayo) ribs are good but hit and miss today's batch was almost burned not as juicy yummy tummy!!!"}
{"text":"Friday nite comfort food cravings brought me here tonite had the beef plate with cornbread and mashed potatoes and beans( cooked tender but no flavour whatsoever just that from the sauces i played around with ( flavour experiments with the Texas bold, chipotle sweet and hot and apple sauce! Wouldn't honestly recommend this dish to anyone...   tomato and basil soup was heavenly!!  Service was great as usual! No waiting time at all!  5/5"}
{"text":"Bad service, Bad food. Wait staff has an attitude and the food shows how much they care about the customer. NEVER coming back again and will make sure none of my friends and family will either"}
{"text":"Went back for takeout and it was horrible. Ordered ribs and a medium cooked steak.   The ribs were overdone and the sides were way less compared to eating at the restaurant.  The steak was well done and was tough. Sides were also way less in quantity compared to eating at the restaurant.  Will NEVER come back. I'm done here"}
{"text":"Last night my girlfriend and I were very hungry so we decided to get Nachos. For my order, I had the pulled pork nachos which didn't taste that great and my girlfriend got meatless nachos with extra guac. One of the main issues that we had was the guac was literally frozen and it honestly felt like I was drinking water mixed with guac instead of the normal guac itself. Another reason why I was really upset was because we had asked to put extra cheese on our chips but it turned out to be barely any on them. For the service, the waiter never came up to our table to check if I food was okay. She actually never came to ask us but another waiter eventually helped us out. In the end, we eventually paid for extra guac and extra cheese and left a small tip.   if you're ever going to Montana's (Newmarket) don't ever get their nachos because it was horrific.  Would not go to this location again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday April 9th at around 6:40pm with my wife. We were told there would be about a 35 minute wait for a booth which was no problem, as we noticed it was quite busy in the restaurant. Hostess approached us about 30 minutes later and told us we could have a table if we would like to sit now to which we agreed. Ended up sitting at an end table, which again we understood as the place was packed, but what we didn't understand was why we were left waiting for 15 minutes without a single server approaching us for a drink order or even acknowledging our presence. To make matters worse, another couple who had arrived right after us ended up in a booth just beside us - and got their drink order right away!. We ended up just walking out as it was clear they had either forgotten us, or were too busy to care. I've had slow food service at Montana's in the past but this was inexcusable. Never again. Good news is by the time it took me to write this review our pizza delivery had arrived! Thanks Dominos!"}
{"text":"Since new management I don't know how many years ago, this place has been in the decline. We've been to other montanas and the richmondhill location really doesn't compare. The food just doesn't taste as good. Children's menu portion of food kept getting smaller and smaller. I am very disappointed because this is the closest montanas to us. We fell in love w it back in the days when they hired a balloon twist clown on Tuesdays. Ever since the management changed things just went downhill from there."}
{"text":"Oh well can't expect much here. Chicken wings are pre cooked and overdone smothered in store bought BBQ sauce. Total crap. The Rubin sandwich was horrible and the chicken meal looked like a nugget. Another place going down hill fast. Understaffed and slow service from waitresses with an attitude."}
{"text":"My friend and I were invited to attend their patio party kicking off their $5 Thursday drinks. It offered free desserts, swag, beer (apparently), and had a cool live singer. The drinks were ok, so were most of the free samples. There was only one thing my friend and I had that stood out for both of us and that was their key-lime pie in a jar which was the teeniest piece of heaven. The crumbly graham cracker crust on the bottom had both of us scraping the jar to get every last bite.  Their cocktails are fun and creative, and kudos for giving credit to the staff who created them right in their menu. It by all means wasn't my all-time favourite drink but when you are wanting to wind down after a long summer day, they do quench your thirst."}
{"text":"Came here with the family. Loved it. We started with the nachos with sausage which was really tasty and a great with spicy. I got the steak with corn and fries.  Service was great he was nice funny and always came up to check if we were ok or we needed anything else.  Great atmosphere. Crazy stuff on the walls   Loved it I would so come back dying to try the ribs"}
{"text":"Great food. Pretty slow service. Waitress was friendly. Gal that seated us covered our waitress and took drink order. Seemed as though she was hating life today....not a smile,  in fact, a frown. Hope her day gets better...."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch a couple days ago. I didn't have huge expectations since Montana's is a chain and they don't vary hugely from one to the next. This felt like a particularly strange experience though, as our server was rather awkward and the people I was with were in a bit of a funk too. I should have stuck to my two faves: the Antojitos or the Firecracker Burger (I get the jalapenos removed to take it down a notch usually). Instead I chose the Chorizo Flatbread. It was alright. Edges were too crispy and the inside was too loaded to eat without a fork and knife. I found it quite salty as well. Next time I'll stick to my regular picks and hope the server is a bit more easy to converse with.  One of my friends has an allergy to poppy seeds, which are on the buns and she didn't know this when she ordered her burger. They kindly brought her a new side in a couple minutes and remade the burger for her with a different bun (which did take a while). Was glad they took care of her but again the server and manager who came out lacked a bit of smoothness to how they handled the situation, although they did resolve it. It just felt a little awkward and the manager kind of made it sound like it was her fault (which it could have been - our menus were taken already so I didn't get to check if it says \"seeded bun\" or not).  Overall not bad, but was the least enjoyable experience I have had at Montana's, which out of the chain restaurants out there, is generally one of my favourites."}
{"text":"It's not fine dining, but if you're looking for comfort food/BBQ then this is a great place to hit up. They've got a large menu, including a selection of appetizers and lots of MEAT.   My favourite are the chicken fingers with medium wing sauce on them (hot is pretty HOT). It's a generous meal and they let you substitute the fries with any of the sides. Whenever I crave chicken fingers, Montana's is the first place to come to  mind.  The staff at this location is friendly & generally pretty good at checking in. Just be careful as it gets very busy around dinnertime, especially on weekends. The bar has the same menu but it's self-serve seating, for those not with kids. Tons of parking at this location as it's located in the Signal Hill mall."}
{"text":"I had the Large Honkin' Beef Ribs and it was awesome. For $27, you get ribs with a massive amount of meat on each. I would guess that there's about a pound and a half of meat total.  The meat was pretty tender but the marbling could have been better. You can only get a certain amount of tenderness without sufficient marbling. But let's keep it real - at a higher end restaurant, you would get better marbling but you would get one of these ribs for probably $40+.  The service was attentive and the atmosphere is fine."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. I particularly enjoy the ribs here and the corn bread. Do try the mile high mud pie for dessert. Nothing else particularly outstanding about it."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. The chicken was stringy and dry, the hostess and our waiter weren't very friendly and seemed and quiet and anxious. There was no music, nothing in terms of atmosphere except the sounds of children shrieking and crying so the ambience (if you could call it that) was quite unpleasant. The prices weren't unreasonable but with the quality of the food it still felt like a waste, honestly I feel like I would've had a better experience if we'd gone to McDonald's. From the way the staff acted, my guess would be either their boss is a jerk, or they are tired of fielding complaints from customers about the low-quality food which they can't do anything about. Take the hint, Montana's. This used to be a great family restaurant.  On the plus side, I will say their boozy milkshakes are quite good."}
{"text":"It's my favourite location, I always find reservations when I plan a party it's has great employees and great atmosphere and food and you need to try the Burgers it's awesome so I high recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Would never eat here to begin with just wanted a drink on the patio. Patio was empty and took a seat.  Was told it was a 35 minute wait for a drink and we had to leave seat.  Never again."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I came here before going to a movie recently.  This place has an ideal location in an area with little other option besides chain restaurants.  I intentionally came here, expecting good food for a decent price.  (The great thing about chains is that they have lots of capital to invest in great decor, as well as food that is consistent across restaurants.)  Here is what you can expect....  1. Terrible service at the bar.  No one got a water refill unless they asked.  If I asked for a water refill, I would get one, but the other people in my party who did not specifically ask for a refill (while their glasses were empty), did not.  NO one was asked how they wanted the steak on their salad or burger cooked.  This should be a fairly basic question.  2. HIt or miss beer.  One beer was luke warm, while another was good and cold. The selection of alcohol/cocktails is very limited.  3. Relatively expensive food.  $20 for chicken fajitas? $28 for ribs? With the lackluster service, the food is no bargain.  4. Just OK food.  The ribs are the best of the options.  Everything has plenty of butter, salt, and grease, but nothing stands out.  5. Parking on a busy night at the theater is almost impossible after 7 p.m.  IF (big if) Montana's could find a way to focus on customer service, it could be a much better place. Unfortunately, the place has a crowd of customers who do not want/expect any better waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Montana's on my way home from work to catch the last half of the Blue Jays game. I won't let their loss affect this review.  It was a little early for dinner so I thought I would just order something light (to justify me occupying a seat). The Steak Bites looked interesting - tender pieces of sirloin, lightly coated and seasoned, served with our Cajun dusted onions and our creamy horseradish and KAPOW! sauces. Sounds good.  What I got was a very generous serving of crispy coated chunks of beef, thinly sliced onion rings and a creamy sauce on the side. It was much closer to a meal size than appetizer, enough to share. I enjoyed the texture, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The flavour wasn't bad but I would have preferred a little more seasoning. The sauce made it right. The onions were nicely seasoned.  I'll have to come back for their all you can eat ribs..."}
{"text":"I was shopping with a friend nearby when we decided to get something to eat and saw Montana's. Parking was hard to find because of the movie theatre next door but we eventually found a couple of spots.  We were seated promptly and a server stopped by to say hello and asked us to give him a few minutes. No problem, it was busy. My friend ordered the Fire-Grilled Pineapple Salsa Salmon and I ordered the Braised Beef Skillet with a salad on the side, no cucumbers.  Our orders arrived and there was a big piece of cucumber in my salad. Good thing I'm not allergic to it, I just don't like cucumbers. My friend enjoyed her salmon and thought the portion was just right. My beef skillet, however, I don't think lived up to its advertising. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't as tender as it should/could have been and it could have used a little more seasoning.  We finished our meal with a couple of mini desserts that weren't bad.  Overall, split decision."}
{"text":"We are regular patrons of Montana's in Richmond Hill and Aurora for over 6 years now. So yesterday, when my husband and I were in the Pearson Airport Area and was looking for a restaurant, we readily chose Montana's over others. We are used to the good service and quality of food, not to mention the good prices. We were seated in a booth in front of the bar. The waitress was serving both the bar and the adjacent booths. We ordered the appetizer potato skin and pulled pork, which was very good. We had 2 mugs of Canadian which came in cold, crisp and good as well. But when the Steak Fajitas came out, it was so overcooked I could not even fork it to my plate without breaking it apart. We specified that we prefer medium rare for the steak. Not only was it overcooked, it was way very small in serving compared to the ones served at other Montana's locations. To top it off, we were given plates and one plate was dirty we had to request for a new one. I was hungry and thought maybe I can just put more of the grilled onions and pepper so I ordered more tortillas. This was the stick that broke the camel's back. It took 10 minutes for the tortillas to get to our table, we had to follow up. It was not such a busy day, as it was a Tuesday, but service here sucks big time. If they do not want to lose business to the other restaurants across the street like Boston Pizza, Canyon Creek, the management better train the staff good. This is a good location since there are hotel all around, but with service like this, customers would not give then repeat business. I for one wont."}
{"text":"Antojitos = pure bliss. And, Happy Hour Nachos for $5?? I mean does it get any better?  Good drinks, good food, absolutely wonderful service. Even though the place was packed, our food was impeccably on time and piping hot! So not typical of other Montana's I've been to.   big thumbs up for this location!"}
{"text":"This use to be a great place for a family meal. Until recently, their customer service and food have become horrible.   Hostess and servers were rude and unprofessional. First, the hostess led us to a table in the middle section, packed with people. We asked for a booth seat (party of 4) but she turned us down and slapped the menu on the table without a word and walked away. Mind you, there were empty seats around the restaurant.   Then, our server (I believe her name was Lauren) ignored us for a good 20 minutes before addressing us that she's busy helping customers bill out. We continued to wait for another 15 minutes before another server came and ask for our drinks and food order. When the food came, there was no utensils or plates. Our server was never attentive or took the initiative to actually serve her customers.   Overall, the food wasn't too bad. But don't order the sirloin steak. It was chewy like hell. Definitely not an AAA sirloin, so don't waste your money.  Think twice before coming to this location again!"}
{"text":"We order all you can eat ribs, the first batch took forever, i order the refill right away, i finished eating and a 10 mins they brought the ribs they were hard as rock they gave me 1 dollar discount and manager didnt do anything to fix the problem."}
{"text":"I tried Montana's yeaaaars ago and absolutely hated it. When we moved to the se it seemed like a decent family restaurant to go to. Oh my. I LOVE this place. Its definitely our go to family restaurant. Prices are fantastic. Tons of selection. Great portions. Lovely staff. I can't say enough good things about this place. There was only one time we got a little irked about waiting when there was plenty of tables open but the manager had said the kitchen was very backed up. No biggie! Its worth the wait. Big tables too so if you have a newborn in the car seat you're perfectly fine. Also don't forgot to mention a birthday so you can embarrass your friends with the giant moose ears."}
{"text":"Everytime I walk in to Montana's for alcoholia (Mississauga has limited number of bars, so oh well...), I share some anecdote with my friends about how awful their food is! And my friends usually have a few similar ones...  I've never had worse meatloaf. You can taste the fact that it's frozen and refrozen over weeks and then cooked. Terrible. I don't pay to get frozen food heated up on my plate. I could do that at home. Don't know how this chain has survived."}
{"text":"@MontanasBBQ #YELPGTA #CAAMEMBER #MONTANAS  First Disclaimer: If you are a CAA member, carry your CAA card. Sweet benefits at Montana's.   Other than that, the food is pretty subpar. They have a new Sizzlin' Summer Specials Menu. I ordered the Rib Taster plate for $14.99, fries and rice pilaf for sides. For someone with a small appetite, it was fairly filling. My man ordered the 7oz hand-carved steak for $14.99, along with a side of waffle fries. You'd think from the pictures that this would be scrumptious, and from the price that this'd be a perfect deal. But his medium rare came overcooked, and I am 100% sure cooked from frozen. The steak may as well be all-Canadian, but it sure as hell isn't fresh!   A lot of people shy away from complaining about such disasters and my boyfriend was ready to play around with his food and finish it somehow. But I complained to the waitress. She changed his order right away and brought him a  proper medium rare within a 20 minute wait. This was expected. What was unexpected is that the manager took care of his part of the bill.   As for drinks, I didn't order anything. But the guy ordered himself a country cider cocktail - sweet tart. Tasted like juice if you ask me.   Rating it a 3. 3 is pretty good for Montana's. Plus I am not a fan of cooked from frozen."}
{"text":"Well , just to be fair, I have to say that I have had meals at other Montana's locations, but sure won't be running back to this one.  We went for lunch here today.  My hubby ordered the sirloin steak with a baked potato, and I ordered the pork back ribs with a baked potato.  We waited quite a while to order as the poor server waiting on us, was getting drinks at the bar and also doing the hostess job.  When the meal came, our baked potatoes were inedible they were so undercooked and my husbands steak was cold.  We flagged down the waiter and he immediately took my husband's plate and told me he would bring another potato for me.  Since I didn't want the rest of the food to get cold, I started eating my ribs.  Finally his food came, but oops they forgot my potato, and they also forgot the cornbread.  By the time my potato came, I was done with my meal and it was really not of interest then.  I mean really -- you want to get all the parts of it together! They did give us a few dollars off the meal to compensate... but candidly I thought they could do better -- I mean, they screwed up both the meals.    Needless to say we won't be back... but if you are looking for good service at Montana's - pick another one -- this one is a \"pass\"."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at a Montana's. Of all these types of restaurant chains, I like this one and Jack Astors the most. Service is always quick and friendly. I only ever order burgers or steak so can't comment on the other items."}
{"text":"As Larry David would say, pretty pretty pretty... good.  If you want comfort food without any extras this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I don't mind chained restaurants.  I know what to expect from them, so it is all cool.  We came for lunch.  Everything was normal except for one.  The meat quality of my 7oz steak ($15) was not good.  No, it wasn't the cooking.  In fact, it was seared perfectly to medium rare.  It was sliced thin.  It was plated beautifully.  It was the meat itself.  Despite it was cooked medium rare and sliced thin, the meat was tough.  Others on the table all found their food alright, so I won't discourage you from patronizing this restaurant or Montana in general.  Just maybe skip the 7oz steak entree here."}
{"text":"Fast, quick and and perfect for my craving! The food was cook to perfection and staff super friendly! In front of my hotel so not so long to go!"}
{"text":"They always seem to be understaffed so wait times are ridiculous, tables are dirty when the host seats you, and the servers are hard to grab a hold of. The food is also decent but nothing amazing, you could definitely go to a real steakhouse with better food and service and end up spending the same amount of money as you would here. I also overheard a server telling off a group of kids for not tipping her enough, which is very inappropriate in a hospitality setting (whether or not she was undertipped)."}
{"text":"I usually come to Montana's with my hubby for their ribs only. We came here yesterday for dinner... The ribs were unfortunately dry however they're usually right on point. The service is fast and the waitresses are nice. Bottom line: Great place to get ribs when they're not having an \"off\" day."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Restaurant was almost empty yet I waited for drinks and the bill. Lunch sized Mac and cheese was tasty but barely a child's portion. The food taste was the redeeming factor but don't come here if you're in a rush"}
{"text":"Good food, okay service, service can be quicker when ordering drinks too start, food was nice and cooked to perfection,  beef ribs just came came off the bone"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a recommendation (from my mom, shut up). didn't really think of it as a lunch place but the burger I had.. think it was something like chipotle firehouse or something, was amazing.  Staff was very friendly, but really slow."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, absolutely one of the worst dining experiences of my life. We visited tonight (Saturday) and the line up at the door was massive. Thankfully one of our group had made reservations so we walked right in and were seated right away. This was at 7:30pm. Victoria, one of the servers, approached our table and let us know right off the bat that the kitchen was backed up and that food would be \"slower than normal\" coming out. She took a drink order, returned about 5 minutes later then left. Another server, by the name of Jenny came over and took our order. Well...we waited...and waited..and waited. Went through all our drinks...they were replaced...and waited. Finally, our appetizers came out at around 8:45..over an hour after our order was placed. They were lukewarm, disappointing and tasted a bit stale. Our entrees didn't come out until well after 9:00pm....my fajitas were sizzling, so they were ok. One of our party ordered a Caesar salad with the steak bites as their meal. When the salad came out, she inquired about the steak bites. The person who brought them out said she'd go check on them. Jenny, our server came to our table and advised us that between the time we ordered and the time the food came out ...that they had run out of the steak bites. She apologized and offered another dish as a replacement. The person who ordered them questioned the timing of the new order, as it had taken almost an hour and a half to get our first order. Jenny promised that she'd rush the order.  About 5 minutes later, Jenny brought out the steak bites..she stated that the manager had located some and made the dish themselves. They were downright awful...they were dried out, overcooked pieces of meat. They were disgusting! Any reputable steak house that would try to pawn this dish off as a viable meal should be avoided. As our dining companion had ordered another dish in place of the steak bites, they came out a few moments later (they were the bison sliders). They were as awful as the steak bites....overcooked and dried out. Disgusting as well. The only saving grace of this whole meal was two things: 1) Jenny our server was warm, funny and great, but even she couldn't salvage this train wreck of a dining experience; and 2) the fresh mini donuts were fantastic. Huge disappointment at this place...don't think our group of 4 will ever go back.  While I understand that sometimes kitchens get backed up, the manager should personally drop by and apologize to their customers, not expect their staff to take the heat from irate customers. We witnessed several tables taking out their frustrations on the servers...but they can't bring out food that isn't prepared. One server was almost in tears from the berating she was taking from some of her tables. The manager should be ashamed of themselves for allowing that to happen to their staff."}
{"text":"Waiter was cool, but the orders were wrong. It's ok though, I was already full and it was on company dime."}
{"text":"We just left The restaurant without having anything to eat. We waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order but no one came. When one of the waitresses passed by and we told her we were ready to order (10 minutes after waiting) she said she would get our waiter to come over but no one showed up. When we left and I told the hostess at the front door why we were leaving all I got was OK. Keep in mind the place wasn't busy."}
{"text":"A nice place for a dine out with your loved one or friends. The atmosphere is nice, warm, cozy and clean. The servers are great... helpful and service with a smile.  We had Fire Grilled Top Sirloin - medium-rare and Sizzling Mushroom. The steak is really tender and good piece of beef. I would definitely give it a 5 star if it was a bit more juicy. Somewhat I felt the flavour was missing due to the dryness. But our overall experience was good  :-)"}
{"text":"Service here was amazing, as was the food.  The wait for the food was just slightly long but I didn't mind it because the food was well worth it.  But really, I just enjoy drawing with crayons haha.  Came here for my birthday with my boyfriend, we both got the honkin' beef ribs combo (25.99).  I had the one with shrimp with two sides, mashed potatoes & a baked potato.  He had the combo with wings with fries and a baked potato.    The mashed potatoes & fries was amaaaaazing.  I had the chipotle honey ribs while he had the cracked black peppercorn.  We ended up being too full to finish it all though, sadly.  I thought I could handle the combo, but sadly could not )):"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location and it's great. It's near the movie theater and other places to eat and drink if you're into hopping around.  I was able to eat light there by ordering the cauliflower chicken wings -- a must try for the vegetarian or the wing-eater on a diet (*HINT* use the various sauces at your table to dip the fake wings in).  I also had the lettuce wrap tacos which had a pulled chicken and chipotle sauce plus a piece of bacon on top. Mmmmmm.   Service was timely and friendly. No pressure to ask for separate or split bills here. A safe, fun, enjoyable place to meet & eat.!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good, especially when you compare it to American chains like Applebee's or TGI Friday's.  I was visiting from Boston with my family and we stopped in here for dinner, not really knowing where else to eat or even what kind of place this was. It's decorated kind of like a hunting lodge, with big wooden tables and plaid shirt-wearing waitstaff.  It was almost empty, so we were seated immediately. Our waiter Mark was extremely friendly and struck up a conversation with us when he learned we were from out of town. He gave us a few recommendations of where to go and what to do in Toronto, where we would be visiting the next day.  I ordered the fish tacos, which ended up being really good and significantly better than I was expecting. The fish was probably frozen, but the ailoi and other toppings on the tacos were so fresh and flavorful it made up for it. The fries were good too--crispy and well seasoned.  I wish this chain was in the USA! I'd definitely be back if that were the case. Next time I'm in Canada though, I know where to go..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Montana's CookHouse after work. We have been to Montana's Cookhouse couple times before. It was our first time having Montana's around dinner time. We arrived the restaurant around 5 pm. There are many people in the restaurant. We had a rib burger and Steaks for dinner. We also shared Shrimp as a starter. The food came out fast. The taste of the food was very delicious. Since we didnt order beers and wine, the food prices were cheaper than normal. In summary, we love our dinner at Montana's Cookhouse."}
{"text":"Montana's BBQ & Bar is one of my favorite Canadian Restaurants. There are so many locations in Canada. I've always been there for lunch when I was in Vancouver. Montana's BBQ and Smoke Meat are the most famous. They grill meat. Meat is like a high-five for your mouth. Smoked ribs, juicy burgers, fire-grilled steaks are super awesome tastes.  My boyfriend and I went to Montana's BBQ & Bar this Monday in Calgary. It was our first time having Montana in Calgary. The location is on South East side of the Calgary and its right across the street from The Home Depot. There are many parking spots outside the restaurant, which is convenience for customers to park their car. We arrived Montana around lunch time. Because of the weekday, the restaurant was not busy as usual. We had a table very fast. After few minutes, the server came to our table and began to take orders.  The same as many other Montana restaurant, this place has the Lunch Combo Menu. Both of us got Lunch Combos. I had House Green Salad, Beef Sandwich, and Seasonal Soup. My boyfriend ordered Caser Salad, Pork Sandwich, and Pot Roast. Our food came out fast. They were all fresh and well cooked. They were in the small portion, but it's very delicious and tasty.  In summary, we love our lunch at Montana's BBQ & Bar. Hopefully, we will come back to Montana again in the nearly future."}
{"text":"This was the last full day we were in the Toronto area for our 2017 Thanksgiving trip. We visited some friends in Stouffville and they took us here since I could not leave Canada without a good serving of poutine.  So, we got here and it was more of an American BBQ place than anything, but who cares. We stepped in and sat down.  Server was super pleasant, patient, prompt and attentive --and we were a table of 10! Props to her. Food was really good, but nothing life-changing. It is what you would expect from any bar or comfort food restaurant in the States. But we knew that. But then, the poutine...  The poutine was EXCELLENT! This was the traditional recipe (fries, gravy, cheese curds, shallots). But this bad boy was topped with a generous serving of BBQ pulled pork! Wow. A carnival of flavor in my mouth! Sauces were so good that we ended up buying a bottle to bring back home.  I downed the whole thing with some red wine (trying to cut on carbs, you know). The wine was ok, but the poutine was top-notch.  Why the low reviews, salty people?!?! If you're ever around here, make yourself a favor and get some of this pulled pork poutine and some cold beer. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Beef ribs are huge! Don't need to order the large just order one. It's big enough for 4!  Tasty!"}
{"text":"Yeah not so much.  When i entered, somehow, there was a smell.  I don't know what it was, but i was glad that they had a patio, cause i'm not sure i could have handled the smell while eating.  Not so good.  I had the calamari, which were ok, average grease.  A salad, yeah well ok, i should know better and have ordered the ribs.  Also the patio is on Dixie, so fairly busy road, BUT you can also catch the planes just taking off from the airport... All and all, just ok ETA, the waitress was really nice and cute."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at around 7:30pm. The place was full but we just had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Liked the wooden cabin look the place had.  Full rack baby back ribs $26.99 + $3.99 upgrade to fulled loaded baked potato. The meal still came with a side of coleslaw or baked beans plus you get a sweet corn bread. The baked potato was simply amazing. Topped with cheese, diced green onions, pulled pork and a mayo dip. It was so good I was tempted to eat the skin too. The ribs were really good as well. Tender meat, fall off the bone goodness. Baked beans were okay and the corn bread was sweet like a dessert. Everything was delicious.   Beef brisket burger $15.99 - basically a burger topped with beef brisket plus an added bonus of deep fried onion strings. The burger was juicy. The beef brisket was tender. The onion strings went really well with the whole package. The bun was soft and chewy and did not get all mushy. It was the perfect burger. Comes with fries or salad.  I knew Montana's had good ribs but I had no idea their burgers were so good. Can't wait to come back.   Service was excellent."}
{"text":"When it comes to Montana's Restaurant..I am a little bias ( I worked there for 4 yrs).  I love the food and I love the atmosphere.  So on our weekly Friday lunch I took the group for lunch at my old stomping grounds.   I have always found the food...comforting and savory.   The ribs are smoked in house and you can even get an all you can eat option any day of the week.  They have a great lunch menu which has some great options (lunch trio, soup, sandwich and salad/fries for under $10 bucks)  Our group had Chicken fingers and fries, a Double Ruben sandwich with fries and I ordered the Lunch trio (Yankee pot roast soup, Beef Brisket sandwich and fries).   We also ordered the usual round of beer, but my buddy ordered a Bacon Bloody Cesar (with candied bacon.mmm)  The staff was friendly and the service was great!   Montana's is a great option if your looking for a place to grab a pint and chill with your friends while have some great food!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the mood for comfort food  and I don't want to cook..I love going to Montana's.  Although it's a Cara foods chain restaurant, whenever I go there I am always impressed by the savory creations that they come up with.  I guess I am a little bias as I once worked for the chain, but working there really solidified me as a guest.  I know that they have a high standard for food quality and the food comes out great.  Whenever I am in the mood for a great sandwich complemented with baked potato or fries or soup for that matter I come here.  The 1lb beef brisket sandwich with apple butter bbq sauce and a side of fries always fills me up.  I could go on all day about Antojitos, all you can eat ribs, steaks...all great comfort food!!  If your going there for lunch, they also have some great lunch size portions of their dinner items for around $10 to $15 bucks.  The service was good at the Bovaird location and I know that if you have any issues you can always talk to the manager.  They always appricate all the feed back from the guests"}
{"text":"The aesthetic of this place goes very well with their theme. It looks rustic & just like a steakhouse or bbq place should. It's roomy & comfortable.   The food on the other hand is overpriced & nothing special. Basically everything on the menu is above $15, even if it's something as simple as a BLT sandwich. The portions are pretty tiny considering the price &the food is pretty bland. Almost everything on the menu I think anyone can make at home for cheaper.   I had the lunch special, with a chicken wrap, Caesar salad & tomato soup for around $12. The portions were rather small & the food was bland. The wrap especially was dry. The Caesar salad was flavourless, not much dressing. Overall, a waste of money.  I wouldn't go again, there's better restaurants. The service is great, but personally the food isn't worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Came here to eat for a Christmas Party, and boy did I get stuffed.   I got a medium 8 oz Sirloin steak, I was offered a 12 oz ribeye steak because the waitress said it might to be too dry if it was medium done. But there's no way in hell id be able to eat that besides I eat so slow. Anywho I got a baked potato as a side, fried onions and coleslaw with 2 grilled  shrimp skewers. God was that ever awesome! I'm not one to eat a lot, so this was a pile of food for me. The steak wasn't that dry for me. As everything else was good, although the onions were a bit too much for me.   The service here was really good, our waitress was really suggestive with our orders. I was later tempted in getting dessert, cheesecake baked and covered with a tortilla with ice cream on the side with fudge. A lot of fudge! A little too much for me, so It was shared! The bill was a bit pricey but I left really stuffed so it was worth it. It's more like a once in a blue moon type of thing."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!  That's my review summed up into two words.   I've been here a few times, usually to mediocre results, but this last time, I made the mistake of trying the chicken tacos. For the last 24 hours I've been bedridden and unable to eat.  So unless you're a glutton for punishment, or looking for an extreme weight loss solution, I would avoid this place at all costs.  The service was also lacking, in that the staff had tremendous issues with our bill. In the end, we overpaid just to leave."}
{"text":"Horrible food poisoning from this location, DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!! I've went there once and the service was really slow and I got horrible food poisoning from the steak it was an awful cut there too, I think the chef needs to be replaced"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The food is ok. I find all the large chains like BP's, Tony Roma's, etc. offer average quality dishes that look good in the pictures. We had a 20% off coupon to use so we still ate here.   I had a steak dish, it was again ok. The steak wasn't seasoned that well, but it was cooked the way I requested. It came with a small cup of beans and a loaded baked potato that wasn't bad, but you could tell it and the plate had been ready for awhile and sat under a heat lamp.    My wife had the ribs with mashed potatoes that also sat under a heat lamp for awhile. She also added the kapow shrimp which tasted pretty good. For an extra $5 you could get this in an all you can eat side.   I will say the prices for the entrees are a few dollars cheaper than many other places and the service was good, they checked on us many times."}
{"text":"Poor service and small portions of frozen food.  If you're drinking beer get bottles, draft is very watered down. Overpriced for what it offers, better options in the area."}
{"text":"Places like Montana's are good for what you should expect here, some good hearty meat!  Today I had a business lunch here and we both ordered the same thing the Chipotle firecracker burger!  It came out just looking like int the menu, huge and very tasty.  The fries (which I try not to eat too often because of healthy guilt!) were fantastic and very crispy as well!  You can order pasta here or maybe an asian salad, but do you order meatloaf or non core choices at asian noodle houses? No you order noodles!  Same goes for Montana's!  I know this place can be hit or miss but today was just plain awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here, tried to eat healthy and had a tough time.  I ordered the chicken tacos with a caesar salad while my lunch friend ate a firecracker burger!  Man that was tough!  But I succeeded!  Good menu with lots of options to choose from!  Western these and lots of carnivore options for the beast in you!"}
{"text":"Is there an option for no stars? This is not my first bad experience. I had to wait over 50 minutes to get an update from our server that their kitchen is \"backed up\". 50 minutes is despicable.. Overall the service was terrible except for the hostess who greeted us and had us sit within 5 minutes. I wasn't going to blame our server because I know the kitchen is at fault. But where our server went wrong was that she did not provide us an update within a reasonable time. We ended up leaving and plan on not returning."}
{"text":"Make sure you make a reservation, or else you'll be waiting for an hour like I did. The waiters are extremely friendly, which makes up for the long wait for food. The food is pretty good, I love going there when I have a huge craving for meat."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Full disclosure: The only reason why I came here was cause of the Scene card promotion, where if you visit participating restaurants you'll get 50x the Scene points if you end up spending at least a certain amount. Therefore you can kind of guess my expectations weren't too high on Montana's.  That being said, I had an awesome server during my time in this place, and honestly if it weren't for her my stay would've been forgetful.  I wasn't hungry that night, so I opted for the fire grilled top sirloin, in addition to a skillet of sizzling mushrooms. I asked for medium rare, and to my surprise...I got medium rare! I always tend to have steaks that are more cooked than what I requested, so honestly I expected a medium steak. Either way, the steak was just okay. In fact, when it came to my table the steak was not hot at all, barely lukewarm if that. The mushrooms, however, were very good so that kind of made up for the steak.  Upon persuasion from the server, I ordered the \"World's Greatest Chocolate Cake\" for dessert. Instead of banana sauce, the server put chocolate dressing instead because apparently the banana sauce \"doesn't taste like banana at all\". Either way, the chocolate cake was amazing. Very tall in height, very chocolate-y, and yet not too sweet for your tooth.  For what it's worth I likely won't return as this was just a one time thing, but I will say the employees here work very hard and I figure I should acknowledge that."}
{"text":"Chicken cesar salad was great. The ribs were a little tough, they didn't fall off the bone. Our server was excellent, very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was bland, salad tasted like it came out of a bag, ribs were so so, my husband's steak was horrible! The waitress advised that the steak would be a disappointment: right on that! Never going back. The system there is the worse! Waited for a table 50 minutes and people who came long after us were seated ahead of us! Waste of money and time!"}
{"text":"The best Montana's I've been at, servers are usually great, and the food is good. I'm not a huge fan of their ribs, but their menu is large and diverse enough that you don't have to worry. I've been coming here for years so I'm confident in the rating I'm giving them."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the BIG BEEF RIBS.... Good thing about chain restaurants is that I can find one almost in every city.  Sadly....now there is only 1 big beef rib. They used to have a choice of 2 big beef ribs back in the dayssssssssssssss..............  That day I had a craving of their big juicy beef ribs, so I just came here for their beef ribs only. Serving was great, and of course the beef rib was excellent. Juicy and tender, OMG :P  One thing that this location need to improve was the smell... I think maybe the weather was humid for few days?  When we walked in, this restaurant smelled like a barn @.@, but of course after seating for 10 min everything smell normal because we got used to it."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary to point out for my first visit.  Our server was nice and friendly but didn't come back to check on us to see if we need additional drinks.  Nothing special either for the meal, I had the rib eye which was cooked to the correct temperature but needed seasoning.  The sides were typical, Cole slaw and baked potato with the works set aside.  Surprising no dinner roles or any type of bread for the table.  Overall good for value and price if you want to grab a quick meal, get in and out with no hassle."}
{"text":"I've been to Kelsey's, the outback, the Keg and finally decided to try Montana's. My husband and I were surprisingly pleased with the quality of food. His steak was the best he's had anywhere (other than Canyon Creek) and I really enjoyed my pot roast meal. It felt like a really good home cooked meal, nothing fancy but very enjoyable. We will be back.  The only thing is the waitor could have smiled a little bit . Greeted us strangely with \"Hey Man\" to my husband. Regardless food and wine really good, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"You know something's not right when the drinks are better than the food. Service was also very slow (the waitress also seemed pretty rude or in a negative mood). I ordered a steak medium rare and not only was it kinda bland, it was also very undercooked."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by this Montana's. To be quite honest, I would've never gone out of my way to come to Montana's had it not been for the fact that my boyfriend received \"movie and dinner\" gift cards which included Montana's. We decided to try it out and it was fantastic. I don't remember Montana's ever having such good selection or such good quality food but I was so impressed. We had the tacos, chicken and waffle sandwich, and the spinach dip and every item was so amazing we just couldn't stop eating. The price was very reasonable, the service was great, the restaurant was clean, and the food was so satisfying that I can say we will surely be returning."}
{"text":"We go to Montana's at least twice a year. It is a family style restaurant that appeals to my kids and so we continue to go to this restaurant when there is a birthday or two in the family. The experience is always fun. This time we brought my uncle and aunt for my son's 4th birthday. They enjoyed themselves immensely as they devoured the ribs (found them delish). I always tend to order the chicken fajita's only I'm wondering when they decided to change it up (a couple years back?). The chicken fajita's used to be yummy, however is now smeared with BBQ sauce and it's not to my liking but I forget and order it anyways. My husband ordered the pot roast this time (a first) and found it to be just OK. He would not order it again. Either way my kids enjoy the food (meals come in a cardboard truck), the desserts for them are epic and experience is fun. That and the customer service is what keeps us coming back because if it wasn't for the kids, we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I found it to be mediocre and overpriced. However, for families with small kids, it can be a great choice to throw birthday parties (more than half the clientele were families with birthday kids!)  Get your expectations adjusted and enjoy Montana's!"}
{"text":"Worst Service EVER!!!  Went on a date there and we sat in the Bar section.  Took over 20 minutes for anyone to serve us.  When we found the table had cleaning spray on it and cloth and we asked the waiter if we can sit here.  He said yes walked away. We then asked can you wipe the table down and take the cleaning supplies.  Maybe thats why we got no service.  20 minutes later the bartender came over to take our order.  We both ordered drinks and food. I asked if I can also have a glass of water.  She came and brought only me water.  Why would you only bring one person water?  Later my date asked for water. She came back gave him but never refilled my empty glass. What? Seriously what type of service is this place.  I have been here before the service was just as bad. I was hoping it was a one off. Apparently not."}
{"text":"Great service. We came  for All you can eat ribs.  Some alcohol selection.  Don't miss their mile high mud pie."}
{"text":"I have been to the location several times now and always had fantastic service and delicious food. Montana's was not always my favorite of the western chain restaurants as I was never a fan of the style of decor and the heavy meal options. However this place has won me over with fast, friendly and knowledgeable  service and simply delicious food with many options and fair portions.   Like Jack Astor's, Montana's also uses the brown paper table cloths and crayons for the server to write their name... now I was never really a fan of this but at Montana's it seems to fit the environment and can help to remember your server's name. My latest visit I was served by a lovely woman named Ashleigh and she was fantastic; friendly without being fake, fast and accurate... she made the experience even better then I had anticipated with her upbeat personality and super fast service. The tables are spacious and always clean with plenty of seating options for everyone including a large patio for the warmer days.  The chicken and rib combos are my top choice but I have tried burgers, apps, steaks and fajitas which were all incredibly well prepared always as I specified. For the type of home cooked, hearty meal the prices are competitive as the quality is good, consistent and the portions are large. I have grown rather fond of the interesting choice of glasses, being lidless jars and the drinks here are always made perfectly! They have excellent drink specials, a HUGE beer mug for the beer lovers out there, they have a delicious pickled ceasar and my favorite Big Mama's Late Afternoon Lemonade. YUM!! This is a sweet and refreshing blend of Smirnoff raspberry vodka, strawberry mix and 7up that is so thirst quenching and tasty, perfect for the patio on a sunny day.  I will most certainly be back again and again to enjoy the fabulous food and service this place has to offer!"}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of this chain, I have visited a few other locations and was never terribly impressed but not bothered enough not to come back either.... my experience at this location was as mediocre as the others unfortunately. First of all I myself am not a fan of the decor however I do realize they are trying to establish a consistant and specificly rustic, western aesthetic but I'd rather not be staring into the eyes of a dead animal head while I am scarfing down meat like a hungry carnivore. The wooden benches with no cushion make for a rather uncomfortable dining experience as well and although they go with the theme I do feel they could have been improved significantly.  The service here I found a little cold and on the flat side however I was not bothered by it either, we were promptly seated by the hostess who was pleasant enough however we did come at a very dead time so the wait shouldn't have been long. Our server was efficient but not friendly and again this does not bother me but the guest I was with found it a little unsettling. The space itself is large with patios, full bar and large booths that seem to be able to accomodate large parties as well. Not the largest Montana's I have been to but not the smallest either, these corporate places all have similar and sometimes identicle design, themes and even layout so at least you know what to expect when visiting. Private and large parking lot located just off the highway and within walking distance from several hotels offers a kind of convenience and this location is just down the street from the Pearson Airport as well.   They have a large selection of food and I will say I was satisfied with the quality of it; the ribs were fall off the bone DELICIOUS and the portions of the meals are very large. The cups they serve their pop in are very unique and consistant with the theme... they are small, lidless jars and although it may sound slightly odd it does add a touch of individuality and further solidifies the rustic, western concept they went with. There seems to be different deals which is a good thing because my one major complaint about this place is the price, we ordered to rib/comb meals, 2 pops and I ordered and extra side I believe which came up to almost as much as a Canyon Creek or Keg bill after ordering top steak cuts, lobster and crab entrees with add ons, apps, wine and more. When you consider the kind of food your getting and the establishment itself plus the style of service your really not getting your money's worth.   I am on the fence with this one, I may get a craving for ribs and be in that area, if this situation occurs I may very well venture back to this establishment however it is not a place I highly recommend or would ever specifically visit."}
{"text":"Decent place if u're looking for that Mid-western feel. Beer is well-priced. Food is good but definitely a little on the pricier side of things."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with my family, and I was disappointed. We were waiting for someone to approach us for more than half an hour, and when I told the host that we didn't have a server, he said he forgot. He apologized and I was okay with it, but the service was terribly slow. I love the food and that's why I can tolerate the terrible service but in this location they served me tiny portions in such a huge plate with no sides even though I know it comes with it. The cookie dessert was rock hard, do not get it. Other than that I guess I kinda liked it. They made up for it by singing me a happy birthday song, so thank you."}
{"text":"I like Montana. Its like going Western but not quite yet. Well we are in Cow Town. So came here for lunch and I ordered the beef brisket with coleslaw and baked potatoes. When I asked for extra sour cream and I did get extra extra sour crème. Yum!.   Well food and service is ok. Its a Montana's BBQ and Bar. Love their sauce. If you take all 4 of their sauces and mix it all together its very good with the beef brisket. Just what I like.   Décor looks western and is very interesting. If you come here during or on your Birthday then you get a Birthday song and you also get to wear the moose hat. How cool is that to watch."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalling service. Waited 5 minutes to even have a hostess come and greet us... Were finally seated and had to wait another ten minutes for a server to come to the table to ask about drinks. It was not busy whatsoever. I had time to change my pants in the bathroom.   We left. Shall not return, ever."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday, 06 June 2015.  My partner and I both had the beef rib, which was surprisingly tasty and tender.  The sides were ok....I had the mashed potatoes and gravy, the corn, and cornbread and my partner had a baked potato and baked beans with cornbread. The mashed potatoes were a little gummy tasting, but the gravy and corn were delicious.  The baked potato was a typical baked potato, while the baked beans were disgusting.  The cornbread was good, but tiny (not sure why they would not bake large pans of it and cut it into decent sized squares.  The waitress was EXTREMELY friendly....even with as busy as the place was.  All and all a good experience."}
{"text":"We went on a week night btwn 7pm and 8pm. The place was pretty much empty except for a few tables. The waitress was friendly and suggested a few items we didn't notice on the menu. I think they were daily specials. We ordered our food and just sat there like idiots waiting and waiting and waiting!  We simply ordered an appetizer which took forever to get to us and two steak dinners. When the food came it was tasty. The steak was a bit too salty and chewy. Maybe it was the cut we ordered. After dinner we ordered a dessert with ice cream. We waited and waited again for some time before the waitress came out and told us they were out of ice cream. Not cool!  How do you run out of ice cream! We skipped dessert and asked for the check...again waiting an unacceptable amount of time. We will not be returning to this place anytime soon. (plus the fact that drinks are served in mason jars...it's one of my pet peeves - ridiculous!)"}
{"text":"We went at lunch hour Sunday and as we were walking in the front entrance was covered with cigarette butts, I wonder why they don't clean them up. The food was average service was slow For a Sunday at 12 o'clock,nothing too special"}
{"text":"Never go to Montanas if you want your food at any reasonable amount of time. Took 2 hours to get our food. Manager would not come out of the kitchen . Awful awful awful!"}
{"text":"I really don't mind chain restaurants. Some of them are actually quite good. Originally, I wasn't a huge fan of this place. But my brother won a gift card and we decided to take our mom here for Mother's Day. Our server was Maia and she was quite friendly. She took our drink orders which came promptly after which we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Beef Brisket burger with the chippers, my bro ordered the Chicken Waffle Sandwich with fries, and Mom ordered the Shrimp and Chicken which also came with a side of veggies. All of the food was really good. Which I couldn't say for the last time I was here (hence why I never returned). My burger was delicious and filled with the right amount of extras: not too much and not too little. Three thin slices of brisket was just enough and the fried onions were a nice touch. I like that they now have the sauces at the table. My favourite is their Chipotle Honey; I like a bit of heat, but I'm more of a sweet kinda gal. I found the chippers to be on the salty side but they were so warm. We all finished everything. My bro and my Mom were satisfied with their meals as well but there was no sharing amongst us. Lol. We were that hungry! We decided to go for dessert and we shared a plate of their mini donuts. Yummy! The toffee sauce was great for dipping. My only complaint? Not enough donuts!!!  Overall, it was a nice evening and a great dinner. And more importantly, Mom was happy.  Unfortunately, I dove right in and didn't take any pics. But there's always next time!!!"}
{"text":"I typically try and not review franchised restaurants as you usually know what you get. I'd love to give a shout out however to Montana's NE cause I had a particularly decent experience there recently. The service in the lounge area was quick and friendly and the jumbalaya was probably the best I've had. Given that it's in the same parking lot as the cinema's I can see myself making Montana's my destination for dinner and a movie. 07/30"}
{"text":"The food is good here but it takes FOR EVER to come out of the kitchen.  The service staff try to compensate but you'll be hungry for a long time..."}
{"text":"Average food, average atmosphere.  Not many negatives but not excellent either.   Ordered a ribeye steak with a baked potato.  The steak was tasty but a little unevenly cooked and a little too done for medium rare.  I did get a rather smart comment from the server about being from the States.    Didn't really stick out and probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The food I got was not good at all. My steak was supposed to be medium but came out like leather. The baked potato was cold and Cole slaw was dry. In my picture you don't see the steak because I sent it back. I tried to work with this meal but eventually threw in the towel."}
{"text":"Was here on mothers day (5.13.12) with my family. I am from California & so naturally I have a California ID. I don't carry my passport with me, since I fear I would lose it. Anyway, I tried to order a drink at the bar, and was rejected. Wasn't given a reason, just was told that they weren't going to accept it.(Pissed of point #1) As my family and I sat down to have dinner, a waitress, took our order. She abruptly comes back and says that she saw me take a sip from my cousins drink.(pissed off point # 2). Didn't even touch the damn drink, & she comes up and demands my ID. I have nothin to hide, do I give it to her. Comes back half a minute later, and says and I quote,\"This is a fake ID. If I see you take another sip, I will take all alcoholic drinks away.\" (pissed off point #3) trying so hard to keep my cool, I ask to speak to her manager, and he Promptly shows up. I ask for a reason as to why they say my ID was fake and was told, and I quote,\"I'm not sure. I haven't seen an ID like this.\" IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A US ID, what gives you the right to say its fake? Who the hell are you to say that? I understand that they have a right to refuse someone, but I'm asking for a valid reason why they rejected my Id. They tell me they're \"not sure\". What the fuck is that. NEVER coming back to this place. Not a friendly place to come to. I feel discriminated and disrespected by everyone in that restaurant. The managers, waiter and waitresses all need to learn respect. So disappointing."}
{"text":"We went there since we got a free appetizer by subscribing to their website.    Pros: + tasty food + fast service   Cons: - the menu was warn and unatractive - some of the food came a bit burnt.  Ambiance: (3.5/5 stars) Country themed bar.  They had a few tvs that were very loudly playing sports, but did not have enough of them for everyone to watch them.   The dining area was standard, they had paper on the tables with crayons.  The menu was on a clipboard with loose papers.  One of them was missing the first paper and was replaced with a different type of menu.     Service: 5/5 stars. Very friendly and checked on us a few times without being annoying.  The waitress waited for us to download the scene app so we can get the points.    Food: (4/5 stars) We got antojitos as our free appetiser.  It was  very delicious but you could notice that it was not healthy.    We ordered a salmon avocado salad.  The salmon was a bit burned a  bit otherwise really tasty.  Even with the burnt it was still juicy.  We also ordered chicken fatija.   We got 4 tortillas and asked for an extra one which was given for free (but written on the menu)  Overall I would recommend this place during a game that you do not care too much or if you want a low key dinner."}
{"text":"We decided to go out for dinner last minute. We originally wanted to eat downtown but due to the time (8pm) and it being a Friday we didn't want to wait for a ridiculous amount of time to be seated. After tossing around some ideal places to eat we thought we would give Montana's a try.   It wasn't packed upon arrival. We immediately were seated and given drinks. Here is what we ordered:   - Calamari, which was terrible. It was fried to the point where it flaked off completely and was beyond the acceptable chewiness that calamari is suppose to have.  - Kapow shrimp, a far cry from being popcorn shrimp. It was horribly soggy. I did however enjoy the flavour of it.   - Chicken Quesadilla, It's just chicken, canned salsa, and cheese.  -  Rib and Shrimp, apparently the ribs were good to the people I were with. The shrimp was made in the same manner as the Calamri.   - Veggie and Feta burger, expect greasy sautéed pepers and onions and bland feta cheese. The apple BBQ sauce was strange. The side salad barely had and dressing and only two croutons.   The highlight of the night was when the server took my drink for a refill and never came back with it. He did find it necessary to wave his hand as if there were a fly in the air over our food and ask if we were done. Upon asking for the bill he finally brought it, as if I was willing to stay behind just to drink it. Of course he charged use for it. It's safe to say we regret going for dinner there."}
{"text":"The servers were friendly at our friends birthday party. But my girlfriend got fries instead of her mash potato request. My friend didn't receive her food until everyone was done eating and already ordered desert (nothing was comped or discounted) and my other friend got charged for her order of mushrooms that she didn't even receive. 3 mistakes with one group...unacceptable."}
{"text":"Food and service was perfect.  The wings are double dusted and really good. The ribs with apple butter sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"I've had great experiences here. First time for a birthday, second time for Valentine's double date. We even ordered an app (the spinach and artichoke dip) and asked for veggies instead of bread and they were able to accommodate our request. The food I've gotten every time has been delicious. The place wasn't crazy busy yet as it was early, but we had great service. My husband ordered the all you can eat ribs and they were so good. I ordered a wrap which was amazing! Definitely want to go back and try some ribs of my own."}
{"text":"But I chose to go to this location cause it got the best rating out of all the other Montana's in the area. However, I was quite disappointed with my experience, mainly due to the lack of service.  I worked at a busy restaurant in the past, so I know how hectic it can get at the beginning of March Break.  My boyfriend and I were seated at our table and we waited for 15 minutes before a server walked up to us and ask, \"What you want to drink?\"   No hello, how are you, no smile. We asked for water. She leaves, comes back with two waters then walks away. Didn't even ask us if we were ready to order or not. Another 10-15 minutes pass by and she comes back again. \"You ready?\" We ordered the 1/4 ribs and wings, both with different BBQ sauce flavors.   When our food arrives, she just plops it on the table (at the edge) and walks away. Doesn't even tell us which plate has what BBQ sauce.  The food was good though, cornbread was surprisingly good too. I was expecting chewy, rubbery cornbread.    But yes, the service was just bad.  (However, I may update this if I ever go back to this location - I'm hoping that maybe it was the servers working too much and got cranky. But that's still not a valid reason for lack of service)"}
{"text":"My sister-in-law and myself ordered the Nutella waffle dessert yesterday at this location and we shared this dish and I totally understand why they advertise it as a knockout dessert. I'm a very light eater but this waffle was so good that I cleaned out my half of the plate in 20 minutes or less. This dessert comes with a side of banana sauce but I recommend that you not include the sauce as it'll ruin the flavor."}
{"text":"Ribs were fatty and underportioned.  Waitstaff only visited during order and check time.  Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just ok. Good potential, but the place is self defeating.  Outside: wasn't sure if the restaurant is even open. The landscaping looks like doo doo. Weeds and trash everywhere. The back area near the dumpster looks like hell. Lotsa boxes and trash. Management: the place looks neglected. Made me wonder what the inside and kitchen looked like. Get back to basics.  Food: ok. Had the lunch special. It was delivered quick. Tasted ok.   Server: nice enough.   Two stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Westhills area Montanas for quick bite before the supper rush crowd came in...   My husband and I shared the Canadian Burger with fries and an 8 piece Honey garlic wings.  Service was great and the place was not crazy loud with the usual birthday songs or crowds.  We had a nice meal and it was quite relaxing !"}
{"text":"I've been dropping in here on and off since it opened but unfortunately this location has some problems with its kitchen staff lately and food is below par.   Last 2 times I have had to send food back so I have stopped going until They get it fixed."}
{"text":"Daniel our server was friendly, helpful and delightful. He made our lunch experience fabulous. The food was good and plentiful. Nice BBQ place for a relaxed meal."}
{"text":"Summary: Great place to eat.  Pros: Nice decor; Clean; Full bar; TVs; Relatively good food; Nice service; Good for kids; Great location;  Cons: It's a big place. We came in the middle of lunch. Out of 30-40 tables, only 2-3 were occupied. That made me a bit nervous :).  Details: My friend and I came there for a lunch. The Big Smoke Sampler immediately grabbed my attention. Intuition didn't let me down. It was awesome! My friend ordered 6 Ribs with Shrimp that came with two side dishes and finished it all. I would guess he liked it :).  The Big Smoke Sampler had good balance of meat and sweet potatoes. I loved ribs the most. They were delicious and very tender - exactly as I like it. I have heard Montana's have All You Can Eat ribs. That will be something to look forward for :)."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Montana's Cookhouse.  I was in the mood for pasta so ordered Baked Chicken Penne.  It was delicious and I'd get it again.  Sheila was my server.  She was friendly and took excellent care of me."}
{"text":"I have now been to Montana's twice for lunch, and I can safely say there won't be a third. Although the staff are friendly and service is fast, the food is not up to standard. My friend had fish n chips. The batter was very crunchy and over cooked. I had a bowl of chicken soup. Tasted straight out of a can. Over priced for what I got. Could have gone to McDonalds for a salad and been more satisfied. Oh well. You win some, you lose some."}
{"text":"I don't like to review chains. I find that there is an absence of what a review should focus on because they (in a lot of occasions are very similar). But then there are cases where the service is so terrible that it's inexcusable.  My party arrived at 1 PM on a Sunday, originally we were going to go to the Boston Pizza  across the plaza, but they were full up and we figured since we were already there that we'd give Montana's a try. (Well now we've tried, so no we don't have to return.) There wasn't a lot of people for a lunch on a Sunday, By my count, there was a float of about 6 tables of families of 4 or more, I don't work in the restaurant business by any means, but it should be enough for a staff of 4 waiters/waitresses to handle in an afternoon  Our party of 11 sat down and we were given our menus, our orders were taken by 1:20 PM. There were some adjustments to account for diets and allergies which I can understand as adding a layer of complexity to our order, but it wasn't anything insane in my opinion, mainly omitting things like nuts or mushrooms in dishes. We did also request that some of our appetizers come out as soon as they are done as some of our party had yet to eat that day.  The wait took about 40 minutes for appetizers to come out which I found as really confusing for a slow day. As for the appetizer that was to come out first, it came out last, after everyone else's appetizers were finished, and was ice cold when served. It was sent back to be heated up.  At that point we were really frustrated and brought it up with a waiter and requested the manager, who never came. After two requests to speak to a manager, we went hunting for them.  When we finally found them, we asked what was going on with our order.  We were told that \"everything has been served in a timely manner\".  We informed the manager that no one at our table had received any food.  Enough was enough and we notified to the staff that we were going to leave if anything didn't come out from our order in the next 5-10 minutes. Our mains began coming out by 2:28 (Almost an hour and a half from when we got there).  I ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad, it would have been great if the salmon were a larger cut of meat and if it came warm and not cold. At that point, I didn't care and wanted to leave. I heard a similar complaint from someone else in my party who ordered that. It wasn't worth the $16 and I could get a better salad in the downtown core for less money (Salad Days, tell your friends).  My wife ordered the Goat Cheese Penne.  Her food came out lukewarm and the vegetable pieces in the dish were slivers and barely noticeable.  Definitely not worth $15.  We did get money taken off our bill but it wasn't enough in my opinion. I think it's fair to say that we won't be coming back for the lack of service and mediocre food.  For those playing the home game, we left at 3 PM"}
{"text":"The food and service were great. Our server Daniel was very attentive and courteous. Our food tasted very good and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Father's Day lunch request for ribs, so indulging the boys. We got in Sunday at 12:15pm, seated quickly with drinks. Restaurant was half full. Started with chorizo nachos with extra cheese. They were yummy and messy with guac and sour cream. The guac was what you'd expect to get at Safeway. Not a criticism as you can't expect more than that. You know what you're getting into at a place like this, similar to going to Boston Pizza.   Son had a kids meal of pork back ribs with mash n gravy. He really enjoyed it.  I had the rib sampler and hubby had ribs n chorizo sausage. See pics. The ribs weren't bad but I'm horribly spoiled from smoked ribs in Texas. They were tender but not overly saucy which was a bonus. My sides were corn, fries and cornbread. The corn had chopped red and green peppers in it which imparted an odd flavour that was not at all appetizing and the cornbread was terrible in taste and texture. Fries were fine.  Overall, this is not my choice spot. Service was really friendly and prompt but the food quality for the price point were a miss. I think this would be fine for patio drinks and appies but since we all had ribs, it's a bit hard to judge on only one item from the menu. My favourite were the chorizo nachos from today's try."}
{"text":"This is always a favourite place of mines to visit because of those crayons and drawing paper table clothes. This time was no different as I asked my friend to marry me through drawings (as a joke).   It was not busy as expected on a Saturday afternoon. My friend and I was alittle annoyed because our server took forever getting over to us. We went with the nachos with grilled chicken. I think the guacamole is way overpriced at $2 for a tiny dipping. Why do restaurants serve so little dipping sour cream and salsa with a large serving of nachos? That's precisely the predicament we had on this day. Extra sour cream was required. The nachos were nicely drizzled with cheese, green onions and jalapeño. I enjoyed sharing this starter.   My main was the chicken wings in honey garlic sauce. They were delicious. They were breaded nicely and very tasty. The carrots that came on the side were not that appetizing. I always appreciate the bucket and wet napkins when eating chicken wings.   Overall, I'll visit Montana's again. It's always a fun time here."}
{"text":"I really want to like Montana's. It has a lot going for it. The menu is appealing and there is a huge variety of drinks. My personal favourite is the cider Sangria which you can also get by the pitcher.   We had the steak specials and they were excellent and cooked perfectly.   Service at this location left something to be desired on this visit. The girl who seated us didn't even bother to speak to us and our waitress seemed rather indifferent.   We sat in a half booth next to the bar area behind the hostess stand which is right in front of the door. Every time that door opened a blast of freezing cold air dropped the temperature to the point of being uncomfortable. Don't sit there.   Scene points and promotions are great. If you forget to show your card the Scene customer service people are great at providing the opportunity to collect points after the fact. The only down side (and some may not care) is that they take your phone if you have the digital app and have to scan/enter the card number away from the table."}
{"text":"After coming to this place for two years now I can honestly say that this place is a performer. It may be a chain restaurant but that isn't necessarily an entirely bad thing. Their food is great. Their choice of BBQ as well as barbecue shows a keen insight into what is unique about each that most aficionados will appreciate. Pork ribs, side as well as back, beef ribs, heck if they'd had hot links and tips I'd a soiled myself. The rub must be standard because they had a few different types of regional flavors of sauce. Their meat loaf is super as well as their steaks some might say that all of that Parmesan crust, or peppercorn spicing may merely be disguise the subpar quality of their cuts but they offer steaks seasoned with just salt and time(just like me) and both are excellent. Go to Montana then go to any other chain steakhouse, make the comparison yourself, this place rocks.  P.S. Tuesday=$1 off 32oz drafts of Molson  have I told you how much I love you?"}
{"text":"Montana's Cookhouse is a huge chain, and this location is not the brightest of the list.  Service was very much so-so. Not particularly bad for the area, but lacking any sort of attention, even by GTA standards.  Food was ordinary - nothing exciting, nor something particular to complain about.  Waiting time was tremendously long for a nearly empty place! At least the drinks arrived fast, but waiting for a common plates for about 20 minutes when there were barely a dozen clients in the whole huge building was not fun at all.  I would say, this location is ok to meet some buddies without thinking too much about food, drinks and time - that's about it."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend staying away from this Montana's. Extremely slow kitchen service and absolutely terrible food.   The worst excuse for a Spicy Nashville Chicken sandwich I've ever had.   Even the kids meals were terrible.   Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Where to start. I walked in Friday for a post lunch. 1:30. Only ONE table in the lounge was clear, all covered in dirty plates and glasses, albeit sticky under the menus. There were only six people in the entire place. I ordered the 14.99 steak special. 15 mins later bartender arrived to say the steaks got cooked wrong and they were cooking up two new ones and it was on them... another 10 mins goes by and steaks arrive mine almost blood rare..I ordered medium.  In that time, I noticed the dirty spoon in the creamer for my coffee, the never cleaned BBQ sauce containers, lipstick on my beer pint glass and the filthy windows and walls.. I am not sure I would go back as there were just too many things that had not been attended to. I kept thinking about what the kitchen must look like.. On the positive side, the bartender was super attentive and apologetic. I asked for a coffee, server brought a half cup of sludge \" this is all that was left, I'm brewing another pot\"... but drink this swill while you wait. Then the server arrived seemingly out of nowhere and presented us with the debit machine...  I should just eat at home...."}
{"text":"This was not that good. We did wanne visit a kind of steakhouse and ended up over here. We both did order a sirloin medium-well but it was to dark and it was small. We both didn't enjoy this kitchen and we won't be back over here. 2 stars because it was clean but the food was not that good. :-("}
{"text":"Upon ordering, my guest was informed that her desired meal wasn't available that evening because they were out of the required ingredients.  Half of the table was served their entrees while the other half waited another 10 minutes. I don't eat while my guests are still waiting for their food. As a result, my food went cold. Hot or cold, my chicken was over-fried and pretty nasty.  When my guest finally received her steak, it was also cold. The only acceptable option would've been to fire a new steak, but we had all waited long enough by that point.  We paid full price for our meal, but were given a couple of $10 vouchers as compensation. However, only one can be used per visit, and they expire in a month. I'm just going to avoid this place altogether in the future, and I recommend everyone else do the same."}
{"text":"First off...sat in the Bar area.  When I first arrived, (6pm) my friend had ordered drinks and an appetizer. Looked over the menu and made a choice from the \"seasonal\" menu insert. Server came to take order and said they were out of the cob of corn that came with the ribs. Now, you would think for a seasonal dish they would not let that happen. However...ordered a: \"10 OZ HAND-CARVED STEAK  A 10 oz Petite Filet Steak, lightly smoked, grilled to your liking, then hand-carved and served with Crispy Cajun onions, choice of beans or coleslaw and choice of side.\"   Well...according to the aforementioned description...it is \"grilled to your liking\" and THEN \"hand-carved\".  However, mine was carved first and each piece cooked. Now I'm sure if you have ever tried to cook steak cut into 8 pieces individually and cook it  medium... you will find that its practically well done and very chewy, lacking flavor because you're cooking the pieces not the actual whole steak and then cutting it. Needless to say very disappointing. Add a baked potato so precooked that I couldn't cut the skin with a steak knife. Very dry inside and they attempted to mask it with the cheese and fixings.  It didnt end there... Finished my beer. Waited snd waited and waited...looked over at the bar and the 3 girls were chatting and on their cell phones... I said to my friend \"how hard is it to see an empty glass from 10' away... yet they expect a good tip\". As I said that, a young girl was walking by and heard what I said, she appeared to be some sort of manager - no means of identity or uniform... and asked me if I wanted another beer, to which I said \"yes please\".  I sensed a little attitude in her voice, but ignored it. My friend commented that their food was dry and over cooked - ribs.  Finally...this needs to be said... Apparently, Montana's claims to be a family restaurant. We were there around 6pm. Ok, we sat in the bar - i like to see the tv. But come on Montana's!!! UFC on the TV with kids around while people are eating??? AND... we had to ASK to put the Blue Jays game put on and the bartender put it on ONE TV and left the UFC on the big screen. Sorry Montana's...but as a parent, that is unacceptable. As a sports fan - local sports teams should be the primary choice!! FYI Montana's... Boston Pizza is right next door and there are 50 other restaurants within a 1km radius!! #poorservice #hadbetter"}
{"text":"Great place for a bison burger; Not so great for fajitas. FYI,  Be careful of the menu as there are many misprints on it."}
{"text":"The wait time was ridiculous. When we got there we waited 20-25 minutes to be seated which we didn't mind considering that there were many people. The hostess seemed very lost and confused. We asked her if there was self seating at the bar since we saw a few spots available. She says yes so we started to walk towards the bar only to be stopped by the same hostess who mentioned that we had to wait to be seated. She clearly did not know what self seating meant. A few minutes later a couple walked in and asked if they can go sit at a table at the bar, the hostess says yes and allows them to walk right in and be seated as we sat there and waited. Once we finally got a table at the bar we were greeted by our server who seemed very nice but boy were we wrong. She took almost 15 minutes to come take our food order. We had ordered around 8:40. My boyfriend wanted to watch the hockey game while we waited so he asked the server if she can change the channel for one of the TV's. He had asked her if she can put on channel six. She said \"no we don't do that what is it?\" and my boyfriend replied that it was hockey. She rudely walked away without acknowledging him to change the channel. She seemed very annoyed. By this time it had been almost 20 minutes since we had placed our order. We understood that it was busy when we sat down so the food would have taken a bit of time but by this time the restaurant seemed to have almost cleared up. There were just a few tables at the bar and the rest were empty. Another ten minutes go by and then another twenty. After waiting for 40 MINUTES without an update we asked the server how long she'd think our food would be. Her response surprised us. She said \"it hasnt been that long yet\". And I had to remind her that it had been over 30 minutes. She was extremely rude and had so much attitude like she was above and better than us. She seemed so combative and spoke as if we were asking for too much. After 45 MINUTES of waiting we had finally gotten our food. By this time we had been at the restaurant for one hour and 10 minutes and had only just gotten our food. I had asked for mashed potatoes as my side but got fries instead, my sister got beans without a spoon, and my boyfriends steak was burnt from the outside and overcooked on the inside. It was obvious that we were not going to leave a tip for anyone. I cannot begin to express my extreme disappointment and dissatisfaction. I am not over exaggerating when I say that this is THE WORST Montana's I have ever been to and probably one of my worst dinning experiences. Your staff not only seemed stuck up and rude, they also seemed confused and seemed like they don't know how to do their job. I want to mention that we were not the only ones to feel this way. The table next to us also got their order wrong and complained about the wait time to receive their food even though they were only two people. I will never be back I will discourage anyone from going to your location because frankly speaking, customers deserved to be treated much better than your staff does. You just lost four customers."}
{"text":"I don't come here a lot but when I do I regret it every time.   The food isn't that bad & the service is ok. My main problem is that each time I've gone they always run out of something. I always come here on the insistence of my boyfriend, who, for some reason, really likes the food here... The food is nothing special.   Anyway, one time I went with him & he ordered the chicken & rib special - they were out of the chicken. We came for dinner around 7:00pm on a Friday, of all days to run out of food....  Another time we went & I ordered their Chipotle Firecracker Burger & they were out of the jalapeños that they fry & put on the burger - the jalapeños that essentially make this burger \"firecracker.\" I was disappointed with this burger to be out of ingredients considering it is SUPPOSED to be a signature item. Then again today, they ran out of meatloaf when I ordered it after receiving a raving review from the waitress. It was 8:00pm & how do they run out of meatloaf?!   This location seems to ALWAYS be running out of things... Does anyone do any kind of food inventory???   When it was time to order dessert & we decided on the cookie skillet, I have to say it was more than disappointing.. It was a microwaved cookie with burnt caramel sauce on the edges.  I don't see why anyone would want to eat at this place & particularly at the Hurontario & Eglinton location. It's up there for the worst places I've eaten at. I wouldn't recommend eating here even though you will receive good service... I'm just saying with all the times food ran out for me, you'll probably go & get nothing too because they probably just ran out of what you ordered."}
{"text":"Came to this store for group lunch before the Christmas holidays. I ordered chicken breast with quinoa. Waitress asked if I wanted one or two chicken breast. I said one since I'm not a big eater. Really regret when the dish came. And I mean when it came. Took them almost 30 mins to bring out our dishes and even then, some didn't get their dish until much later. The dish was bland and almost tasteless if I didn't mix the chicken breast sauce with the quinoa and the vegetables. I mentioned I regret telling them one chicken breast right? Cause the portion size was extremely small and if I paid for the same price as someone who wants two chicken breasts, you better give me more vegetables. So no I'm not going to come back next time because it's a rip off. They even got rid of the lunch menu and forcing everyone to order from the main menu (for lunch and dinner) without the lower pricing for lunches."}
{"text":"After a very trying day, it was a relief to come to this  Montana's location and just relax. We arrived just before the dinner rush and were promptly seated. Our waitress was very friendly, and helpful.   I ordered the chicken tacos, which were delicious, and my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. He's quite fussy about pulled pork, and as such, I was a little surprised to hear how much he liked it.   Fast service considering the time of day, good food, and a friendly, efficient waitress? I couldn't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Could have possibly been the best dining experience of my life. First of all, I love poutine! I can say with confidence that this is the third best poutine in all of Canada obviously behind Ma's and this hidden gem called La Belle Patate from small town called Canmore up in Alberta (highly recommend visiting). Oh and I also got their chicken wings. The menu says 16 wings I swear to you they gave me 18! Not one but two extra! Needless to say I'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"the good: ok desserts: the cookie in the skillet was nice n hot. the worlds greatest choc cake was ... mehhh not the greatest  the bad: kapow shrimps were not sizzling and were very bland  the ugly:Peter our server. He did not make us feel welcome, compelled us to leave a tip after his rude service. Montanas should get rid of their gen x xenophobe staff. felt we were rushed to order even though the place was empty. even though the other waitress was much nicer."}
{"text":"Really great service with a smile. Can't remember the server's name but she did a terrific job. I had the meatloaf (which I contend is the true test of a restaurant). It had a sweet barbecue sauce glaze, but not too sweet. Onion straws, and mashed potatoes. Really good and a very big portion. I liked it a lot -- even moreso that it was just across the street from the hotel."}
{"text":"HATED it!!   I was with a group of under 20 people. We arried and we started ordering we even had numbers to help the serves out.    I had the BBQ chicken fajitas and i got all the things i order but the lettuce was old so i sent it back.  When i returned it was the same.    So i ate and left but i tryed to let the manger know and her responce was we open a new bag!   I was mad and i got her name and i'me going to talk to her boss.    My question is the quality of the product is what i have to wonder!!!      If i could give lower then one i would but i woudl stay away from this place!!  The staff doing give a crap from what i gather from that one night!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see the poor reviews of this Montana's location after I had such a positive experience last week myself!  After a few poor dining experiences at local restaurants, my boyfriend and I decided to head to Montana's since its one of his favourites. We came in on a Saturday night and it was busy as expected. The hostess told us about 15 minutes for a wait and she was bang on - 15 minutes later, we were sitting at a table ready to order.   I haven't eaten at Montana's much but its always been pretty good, so I was hoping for more of the same. My boyfriend decided to order ribs and I ended up trying out the quarter chicken dinner with corn, sweet potato fries and a little cornbread too. Our meals didn't take too long - I didn't have much time to draw on the table before our food came out; I'm not sure if we had just missed the dinner rush but our food came quickly and was definitely hot!  My chicken was quite good and the sides that came with it were as well. I couldn't eat everything on the plate since there was so much, but I did steal my boyfriend's cornbread and I ate both his and mine - they were really good! The sweet potato fries were really nice and crispy but I could have used something to dip them in, as most places serve those fries like that. The corn was good but kind of odd, spicy (and i know the menu specifies that). Overall, a pretty good looking plate for the price! I did get to try some of the ribs and ... oh my... they were quite good. I'm glad I didn't order them for myself because I never would have been able to eat all of them, but next time I MUST get those ribs. So very very good!!  Our waitress was very nice and attentive, made sure that a new drink was on the table before the old one was finished and she made sure that our food was good and that we were enjoying everything. Not too much and not too little - great service, just how I like it.  Overall, pretty damn good experience at Montana's! I didn't have high expectations but I'll definitely be going back sometime soon and will try out a few more things on the menu. I think its worthy to note that all the restaurants in this plaza tend to get slammed with people on weekends. I was prepared to have to wait for my dinner (because of lots of people waiting for tables, slow kitchen or service) but everything came really fast, hot and with great service. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Montanas is one of my favorite place. I love their kapow shrimp and rib bits that's why I went to this location last week, however as soon as we entered we had to wait for 10 mins to get the table and than after we got the table our server came after 20 mins on our table only after we asked for our server. It was the worst service ever. Food was good but the amount of time I had to wait for my food to be served made the worth not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for a group work lunch and the experience is on par of what I expected....while the lunch specials have attractive pricing and the service was OK., the food was just sub-par.  The baked chicken penny pasta was way overcooked and the pasta was soggy in a rather blend-tasting rose sauce. The chicken portion was stingy. Garlic bread that came with the pasta was cold, hard and dry.  Definitely have had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here with my family when I was visiting them. It reminded me a combination between Cheddar's, Saltgrass Steakhouse, and Outback Steakhouse. They love meat here. I ordered the Canadian burger because I guess that would fill my desire to get some Canadian food. (I'm a dumb American. What can I say?) The burger was really good, as were the calamari and spinach artichoke dip. I tried poutine here for the first time... delicious but a little salty. Service was really good. Our waitress was really friendly and really attentive. It probably isn't the first place I would recommend during a visit to Markham, but I would gladly go if it was recommended to me."}
{"text":"Came in the front,  waited for the hostess for approx 15 mins. 10 minutes within being seated,  our waiter came to ask for our drinks.  Later on,  when our food arrived,  we weren't even given any utensils/napkins and it was so hard to catch the waiter/bartender's attention that we had to go up to the bar and ask him for it.  My sister's drink was also (almost)  forgotten... The manager had to come up and recheck if we have our orders etc. When asking for the bill,  still couldn't get his attention...  We had to go up to the bar to pay.  Ribs were good though"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak (14oz) and asked for medium rare. Got a medium well that was tough! I had steak at another place on Monday and definitely could tell the difference.  The loaded baked potato was also very bland. Will not order the steak from there again.  I will return to try other stuff and make other reviews."}
{"text":"A few years ago I went to Montana in Newmarket and was pretty unimpressed. Overall I don't have a great love for these franchises.  I thought I would give it a try on a Friday night. I've been on a low carb diet for the past few months so eating put has become a bit of challenge. I was surprised to see how busy Montana was last night. I ordered a sirloin steak and asked for broccoli on the side with little optimism. I was pleasantly surprised. The steak was good it was quite lean and I the broccoli was flavorful and not over cooked. The waiter we had was very helpful as well."}
{"text":"Montana's has been a choice for our family for years. It typically has something good and friendly service. The last few trips have left my opinion flat. It's ok nothing special. It feels like a standard reheat and serve prepared food establishment. No fresh zest to the staff or the menu. It seems like Montana's has been left on simmer to long. Wake up! Perhaps a secret boss episode could help uncover the lack if passion.  Not a bad choice just no magic."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while, before or after the movies, the food is mainly spot on for a place like this, servers mostly are pretty good. steaks, chicken, whatever you get, I never had an issue with the way it's cooked or presented. definitely a place to come after watching a movie with my wife or kids."}
{"text":"This location sucks. Took 15 mins for waitress and the Place is half empty. Won't offer lunch menu items that other Montana's do. As per waiter manager said it's too busy and kitchen would be too busy. Won't be back here anytime soon. Markham richmondhill an Brampton locations are 1000 times better"}
{"text":"Gave this place 1 star ONLY because the drinks are good. But if you want cold food, slow service, and terrible everything else... come here... LOL. We didnt even have a waitress. It wasnt even super busy and there were LOTS of tables available while people were waiting at the door to be seated.  DONT COME HERE :)"}
{"text":"I generally like Montana's and usually don't review chains, but I thought I'd add a note about the service at this Montana's location. We had a large group of 9 adults for a birthday, where some people arrived late and some early, etc. Our server Phil was really great. He was attentive without being annoying, got all our orders right and just generally had a great memory. There were no issues at all with our food or the bills. He was fantastic."}
{"text":"Pretty great service for a movie theatre location.  The staff (at least my server and the hostess) were super nice and very courteous and quick to serve.  They know to ask \"when is your movie time?\" To ensure you get your food and to your movie in time!  We ordered a few apps and drinks and everything was great.   Would go for dinner before movie anytime."}
{"text":"I'd say this place has really good food as long as you know what your ordering! I come here frequently and usually order a salad or so. But when I tried AMAZING FRESH BEEF RIBS from my sister in laws plate, I was in awe of how GOOD it was! Next time I'll be ordering the ribs!"}
{"text":"We ate there today for lunch. It was to celebrate a few of my our co-worker's birthday. We all experienced bad stomach right after.  Service was great and fast. Food is just toxic"}
{"text":"My team at work isn't great at making restaurant suggestions. My task was to book time for us to celebrate a software release that we have been slaving away over for six months. I asked for suggestions and got nothing.   Luckily, my manager came up with a few. We went with Montana's for our team lunch. I haven't been to one in years. This one is about a five-minute drive from our office.   We were a group of six. It wasn't too busy. I didn't bother making a reservation.   The lunch specials are nice. I love mac and cheese. The downside to this lunch special was that it was served with a side Caesar salad. I wasn't in the mood for it. I asked our server if I could swap it out for a house salad. Yes! I love versatility.   So, my mac and cheese had bacon and spiral pasta. So good! I had contemplated getting the regular portion, but I'm glad that I went with the lunch special. The side salad made me feel like I was eating something healthy... ha!  You can get chorizo sausage with this mac and cheese. I opted not to. The bacon was good enough for me. I loved the cornbread. It was yummy, warm, and perfect.   I ordered a Diet Pepsi to wash everything down. I liked the mason jar.   Service was fast and friendly. The bill came promptly. I was expensing it and left a decent tip. We all got lollipops. I had mine there!  I'd come back here again. I may have the regular-sized mac and cheese next time. If I have room, I'll try dessert.   (204)"}
{"text":"We'd made reservations earlier in the week for 9 people. But somehow when we arrived today they didn't have any record of it. Despite this we were seated quick enough since it wasn't busy at all.   We made our orders then all the waiters & waitresses we'd seen before seemed to disappear. It took quite some time for our food to arrive. Two people in our group ordered coffee & it was cold. One person's well done steak was too well done on the outside. The appetizers were yummy. We had the Calimari & the Cookhouse Platter. When it came time to pay there was no waitress to be found. The waitress later told us that the manager had let the other wait staff go home because it didn't seem busy. This was done around 1pm. Bad idea. Because when we left the restaurant was full of people & only had two wait staff to attend to them. A miscalculation on the manager's part.   Best thing about the lunch was when the birthday people (3 at our table) got their ice cream & had to wear a helmet with deer antlers on it & another had a moose antlers.My hubby almost brained me with the moose antlers! LOL. Plus the few wait staff there sang Happy Birthday. Not too impressed with this location. Hoping others are better!"}
{"text":"Not more or less than OK, service ok minus, appetizers ok plus (the Cajun shrimp is very good) and main courses are a general OK."}
{"text":"Takeout  I was on the way home, starving. I called ahead, told 15 minutes, I arrived and it was ready!!   14oz hand carved steak, Cajun onions and two sides... $28!!! You can't find that anywhere north of Steeles Ave..  Bartender(paid at bar) didn't even give a thanks to my tip or patronage, which was kind of upsetting. If that's the attitude from the staff, maybe be weary.   But the food was good.   /thumbs up for the food"}
{"text":"No substitutions No canoes(for kids) Smallest portion sizes of GTA Montana's Service was sub-par but it was a bit busy.  Got email from manager explaining the \"drawbacks\" of this store  Montana's are great, I've gone to a dozen in the GTA and if you're feeling like ribs/Montanas drive the extra 5km  Date of visit Saturday may 14th"}
{"text":"So I went to Montana's last night with my friend. We were actually planning on going to Kelsey's next door -their new patio looks so inviting- but it started to rain so we went for Montana's all-season patio.   We shared the bbq sample platter, and even thou it had great variety -a total of 5 items - only the fried pickles and the 4 cheese dip really hit the mark. The potato skins and the rib tips were extremely dry and stale, a huge disappointment considering that Montana's is a rib joint.    We then ordered chicken fajitas and beef fajitas. I asked for my meat to be medium, but it came well done. And my friends chicken wasn't any better, it was dry dry dry. There was no seasoning whatsoever on the meat or veggies, so we had to request Tabasco to try and resuscitate this disaster of a meal.   Service is friendly but inefficient, there wasn't enough attention to detail. After our meal, we ordered tea to wash it all down. It was served on cute mugs but without a saucer or napkins, so we were left wondering where could we possibly stash the tea bags; specially since my friend requested sugar and the waitress- who must have gone to the sugar cane fields to get some- never returned.   Well she did return, but 20+ minutes later without an apology or comment, she just picked a sugar bowl from the table behind us and said \"here's your sugar\".  I'm very disappointed with Montana's, was expecting more from them. Specially since we went on a Monday night and it wasn't busy enough to excuse the lack of quality in the service and food."}
{"text":"Sooo goood . Jordan was an excellent bartender and mixed a mean cocktail. Five stars."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while and although the service is good and my husband enjoyed his 7 oz carved steak dinner and my daughter her Big Smoke BBQ platter, my 10 oz AAA medium rare Sirloin Steak was another story. It was in a very awkward baseball cut, so spherical it slipped away from the steak knife and so tough it needed a saw to cut. The manager was summoned and he offered me a second 10 oz steak cut flatter but still 2\" thick which I photographed. It was almost as hard to saw into as the first steak! The manager apologized and said all their steaks come pre-cut from Cardinal Meats. Shame on Montana's supplier Cardinal Meats for sending steaks cut like this! I probably will come again but not till I've spoken with Montana's corporate owners at Cara. They have a supply chain quality control problem!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a ZERO rating I would!!!!  Not a good meal to be had here! Salad lettuce is always wilted.  Steak is always over cooked and tasteless.  Chicken is that fake stuff they inject to pump up and the grill the crap out of it. Pasta is soggy and greasy.  Vegetables are rotten (I actually had to spit out an avocado it was so rotten).  Fries are cold and been sitting under heat lamps.  Beer taps NEED to be cleaned.   Over priced for crap food, what happened to this place? It used to be really busy, I think the next time you go there the doors might be locked! The servers are rude and your lucky if they even notice you.    Having been in the service industry for years I find it unacceptable to have bbq sauce served to the table that the jar lid is so gunked up that your not able to open it. The ketchup bottle exploded one time opening it, it was fermented! Shot out and hit my daughter in the eye, she cried ketchup for half an hour while the server laughed and said she did it herself!"}
{"text":"I go here regularly and work down the street; it's always been good.  We usually get (and love) the spinach dip for an appetizer.  Their burgers are good and as the previous reviewer said, they're big and loaded with stuff (but they also have less \"loaded\" burgers).  Fish and chips are good but inconsistent (sometimes they're soggy, other times they're nice and crispy).  Beef or back ribs are a great pick if you're really hungry. Patio is nice in the summer, but sometimes the server disappears and you're left stranded. I usually prefer to sit in the booths in the bar area, really easy to flag down a server if you're in a rush and you get lots of TV's to watch if the conversation gets boring.  Not much healthy food but they have a couple salads which aren't bad (if you avoid the muffin/cake thing they give you with it)."}
{"text":"A nice place inside with lots of booths. The sever we had this past weekend was very efficient. We ordered the beef brisket plate with salad. A nice portion but the brisket was far too salty. The ribs were really good, as well as the corn bread. Most entrees are $15 and up."}
{"text":"They did decent in ensuring that I found gluten free food on the menu. The steak wasn't bad. The waitress was nice. The wait was ridiculous. Over an hour for our food and they forgot the sauerkraut on my fiancés burger so we had to wait for that. After waiting so long you'd hope they get the order right. I know it was busy but an hour is excessive."}
{"text":"3.5 stars- good food but not great as a previous yelper said. I wouldn't oppose coming here but I wouldn't recommend it.   Service was top notch. I had a very attentive and bubbly waiter. I can't remember his name he was caramel toned and had a faux haux. I couldn't believe at the end of our meal he was in training he did such a good job with recommendations, check ups and refills.   Food was pretty good. I had the steak, mash potatoes and corn. I asked for medium well and I think I had between medium rare to medium but I was too hungry to send it back. Potato portion somewhat small I'd prefer two scoops and skip the fried onions. But I ate it all so it wasn't bad. Everyone els enjoyed their food. I think the rib and shrimp combo was a good meal and generous portion. I liked the chicken tacos (but how can you mess up chicken tacos) and the burger was a decent size as well. Over all not much to complain about."}
{"text":"To keep this short and sweet, I'm going to sum it up by saying that I will wait a long time for good food, but not a long time for overcooked burnt and COLD food. Our wings came out cold and when I complained, they simply removed the 2 that had bites out of them and then threw the remaining ones into the deep fryer. They didn't resauce them and just presented me with a greasy plate of double deepfried sauceless wings.  My toddlers hamburger was cold and burnt. In my opinion it is unacceptable to expect a toddler to wait 45 mins for a hamburger. Period.  There was no sort of communication during our wait, and although the manager apologized, it will not change the fact that we had to ask 4 times to get vinegar for our fries.  The burger that we ordered to share was good, but the rest of our experience wasn't.  They didn't even come back to offer us a dessert for our kids meal (supposedly included in the price) The lack of care from our server was deplorable. Sorry Montana's. but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Your typical montanas...  went at lunch, had a lunch deal that was quick and good portioned, albeit a little pricey (isn't all of Calgary that way now???) Service was fine, quiet and clean.  Regular typical ol' Montanas."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at this location. Overall nice place. Service was very good, but unfortunately they were out of cheese and we were not able to try their cheese nachos:(, ribs were great, but the second portion (all you can eat ribs) was not that great it was over cooked and dry. But anyway it was amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Screw you Montanas  730pm thurday in late Nov Joined mailing list got free appie.  Had some cream cheese wrap we should have stopped there.. shared the rib and shrimp platter....  CLEAN YOUR GRILLS  Shrimp and corn were gross potato not cooked and cold. Ribs were ok...... the poor waitress was too busy and we almost got so upset and walked out.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"From what I remember, Montana's steak was pretty good a few years back. But the quality has really gone down. Not only that, but the service alone was just horrific. It's no wonder it was so quiet on a Friday night.  Upon arrival, there were about 3 other groups waiting to be seated. Not waiting for A seat, but waiting to be seated because the host/hostess was nowhere to be found. There were about 8 or so free tables, 3 tables not yet cleaned with the bill still sitting there. The servers and bartender saw and ignored the fact that there were people waiting. Hmm.. made me wonder if Montana changed to a seat yourself restaurant. About 8 minutes or so later, somebody finally came up to seat everybody.  Getting service was next to impossible here on a quiet Friday night. It took what felt like forever to finally get somebody to take our order, refill our water, and deliver our food.  Surprisingly, the antojitos were \"drool worthy\" as advertised. Not one bit spicy, but that's how I would've preferred it anyway. It was deliciously creamy! The cheese melts in your mouth just right - not too overwhelming. Not exactly an appetite opener but it was a comforting appetizer.  Both the medium rare Fire-Grilled Top Sirloin (8oz) and The Grand Sirloin (11oz) were meh. Flavour was definitely not there. We ordered medium rare but it was more on the medium/medium well side. Both steaks were somewhat hard and to be honest, nothing special at all. The sweet potato fries, mashed potato, and rice pilaf were probably the next best thing out of the whole meal. I definitely wouldn't recommend the Caesar salad to anybody who likes their croutons, because mine came with 2 pieces of croutons.  This may or may not be a great place to eat ribs (since they have the AYCE Ribs), but not a good place for steak."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday with my family and the first thing we noticed was how empty the restaurant was.  Our server, Daniel did a great job - he was very kind to my daughter and was helpful with making selections.    The food was on par with any big franchise restaurant - nothing special, but gave us fuel after a busy day in the sun.  The biggest disappointment was how long it took for our food to arrive.  We waited close to an hour for our lunch to come to the table and to quote my wife, \"what's taking them so long?  It's not like they're making any chef inspired creations back there [kitchen]!\"  Our dessert also took forever to come; all we ordered was the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream - should only take about 90 seconds in the microwave to warm up a cookie.    The wait times for the food was like fine dining, but the quality was only middle of the pack."}
{"text":"Awesome service went on a Saturday afternoon enjoyed the food, great company also were on the patio. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend got the waffle chicken sandwich with waffle fries. Amazing would definitely go back and loving the new menu  The new menu is new and improved and easy on the eyes. Needs more pictures tho."}
{"text":"Just had to try the Los Nachos Doritos. It was not bad but Doritos that are baked lose some flavour, but of course all the other ingredients like cheese, and jalapenos make up for it. It is huge, good enough for 4 easily.  Also had the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. The fried chicken was actually pretty good but a little dry, and the waffle was kind of dry too. But it was alright. The sandwich was massive. The fries aren't too memorable.   Good service though and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just watched one of their giant draught beers(32oz?) sit at the end of the bar for 6 minutes while one bartender, and 3 servers walked right past it. Bartender, and one server even had a 30 second chat over it. Not acceptable folks."}
{"text":"Good service. Was such a beautiful day out so sat on the patio - would have been nice if it wasn't completely shaded though so that some sunlight makes its way in. Had the brisket burger - really good! :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid place to dine. Been here numerous times and never had a bad experience. Servers are knowledgeable and friendly. They check up on you often enough that it isn't annoying. The food is nicely portioned. Choice of sides for most dishes. I like that they don't drown the salads in dressing like most places. If you have a larger appetite, ribs are the way to go. Despite being a chain restaurant, this location does it right! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and run in a direction away from Montana's. I ordered the big smoke platter and was utterly disgusted. The pulled pork was a pile of soggy mushy fatty pork, the brisket was wet and soggy and the ribs tasted like they cooked on a dirty burned grill. The maneger tried to defend his poor excuse of a pulled pork saying \"this is real pulled pork\". The fried onions were literaly a pile of fried mush. The maneger was rude and  argued with me about all the problems I had with the food. So hopefully he reads this review because this is a \"REAL REVIEW\"."}
{"text":"Very rude staff I asked for a dessert menu and the lady says to me you need that to know what you want to drink."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular  $18.00 burger with 4 pieces of dusted Jalapeño  Slow service Waiter seemed not to care Had to get my own Ketchup and Mustard Not busy  Wonder why Not coming back"}
{"text":"It is an okay location  service is a bit slow, but staff are friendly. I ordered chicken tacos,not the best chicken was cold and the tacos were not soft neither hard in between I guess they were over toasted tacos, I had a house salad as a side dish it is very small and didn't look fresh we also ordered Chipotle burger which was okay."}
{"text":"There was a 15 minute wait for the dining room, so we opted for the lounge. Upon seating ourselves, we were left with one menu for 10 minutes before the server greeted us. She took our drink orders and didn't return with them for another 10 minutes. After taking our order we noticed another table of 4 who had been seated before us who were still waiting for their order one hour after ordering. The manager seemed uninterested in helping the family and offered little to no compensation for the inconvenience. We talked to the couple sitting at the table in front of us who had ordered all you can eat ribs and they said that they hadn't even received their second portion. When we received our food nearly 30 minutes later, it was lukewarm and bland. The staff shrugged off any complaints or requests and seemed apathetic towards the customers. We will likely never return here due to the lack of service, poor food, and general disdain from other customers."}
{"text":"Food is decent.  There's a good selection.  Our server wasn't the best, just short answers each time and hardly ever around.  This was when the dining area was empty too so I'm not sure why she took awhile to check up.  It would've gotten 3-stars if our server had been a bit better."}
{"text":"The service here is extremly slow and the food comes out of the kitchen cold.   The last time I ate here I was lucky enough to find a piece of the metal brush they use to clean the grill - nestled into my sandwhich.   The manager did offer to replace the meal, but did not comp the meal I didnt even eat.   I have not returned since then."}
{"text":"Today my boyfriend and I came here for dinner before our movie. Came around 6:30 on q Sunday and it was fairly busy, however we were sat immediately.   Our server was Kevin aka 'kev'   We ordered the four cheese dip to start- came quickly, was warm and overall tasty.   For entrees- I had the chicken tacos (which they now give two bigger instead of three smaller). They were fairly good. No complaints about them. My boyfriend has the Canadian burger with fries. It was a pretty average burger, but it was good overall.  Nutella waffle for dessert- very underwhelming and overrated. Tbh boarder line terrible. Stale, cold waffle with Nutella squeezed out of a bottle. Would not recommend.   Kevin was great overall. Service with a smile snd offered great recommendations.  Our bill came to just over $49 for two people with apps, sodas, and 1/2 dessert   The restaurant is a goodspot for quick, average food but don't expect GREAT food.  Food 3/5  Service 5/5  Value 4/5 Overall 4/5"}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. Worst service, bland food and slow kitchen. Do yourself a favour, go anywhere else. This is a typical garbage American chain.  The photo attached is their idea of shrimp fajita, this is how they serve it from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Good food, amazing service, decent price, fast service.   That reminds me, I should visit this restaurant more often."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to a Montana's. I never found it all that great. But I must say that the menu changes they've made are a definite improvement.   The menu is now focused around BBQ and has less of the pasta and burgers and other random things that it compiled before. I went with The Sampler Sampler (yes that is correct). Its a smaller portion of their BBQ sample platter. You get a couple of ribs, some pulled pork, a half sausage, and sides. Overall it was decent, though the chorizo was a little charred.  The staff were friendly and on top of things the whole time, though it wasn't that busy in the lounge during our visit."}
{"text":"Customer service was Horrible. Food was very good. I won't come to this location ever again. It wasn't even that busy. Uncalled for. I don't recommend, this location."}
{"text":"I had to have had the worst experience at this location this evening - June 11 starting at 6:36.  We were greeted by a hostess who clearly should not be a hostess as she had no personality.  We usually go to this location 2x a month 5031 Hurontario location for the wings.  We are use to bubbly hostesses.  We asked to be seated on the patio and she said go ahead.  We walked to the patio and she was right behind us.  When we got onto the patio she stopped and stared at us.  We looked at her and were waiting for her to show us to our table.  She just kept staring at us.  Okay so we then asked her \"can we sit anywhere?\" and she replied yes.  We sat at a table and she walked away.  Great start to the evening!!  We then saw our waitress for the drinks at 6:50pm - 14 minutes later a sweet waitress who you could tell was trying to hold the patio on her own.  We gave her our order and drinks all at once because we knew we were going to be in for a long wait.  at 7:25 we still had not seeing our dinner.  Went to speak to the manager as we are now almost at an hour for our meal.  This is is my favourite part, manager comes out.  Clearly does not want to be any where near this restaurant looks at me and says \"Yes???\" okay ... I said it's 7:25pm we have been here since 6:36pm we have not received our meal his response \"ok so you haven't got it yet?\"  but more of a tone like so what? i said that's correct we have not received our meal - he continues to look at me and with the tone like why are you bothering me??? okay so i realized I'm wasting my time.  He then said I will take care of you something on your bill and sorry for your wait.  I said to him thats not the point i'm not here looking for a free meal I just want my meal.  He stares at me.  Okay so everyone likes to just stare at this restaurant.  I walked away and he just was like whatever attitude. Do not understand how this guy has a job as it is obvious he has not training in customer service.  Finally we got our meal at 7:30pm we ate and the poor waitress who served us apologized not even the manager came to the table to apologize.The poor waitress had to! I did not want a free meal and the manager did not take care of any thing on the bill like he said which I was happy to pay as i was complaining only to get my meal not a free one .  I told her it's not her fault and that she deserves a raise for holding the fort.  Never going back, will never recommend to anyone.  The manager needs lessons in customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience and great food.  We were seated right away. I ordered the chicken tacos, they were delicious!!! My son ordered chicken wings which he never had at Montana's, he said they were the best he had tried.   Overall was a great experience"}
{"text":"I have no complains about the food at all at this Montana's Cookhouse location.   But they are really seriously under staff!! When you see the bartender is also the hostess is also the waiter, you know you have a problem!!  My Bartender/Waiter/Hostess though is friendly, good spirited and efficient but he is really sketching himself thin......  talking about multi tasking!  Luckily the food came fast after we waited for a bit for our orders to be taken.   As we hurried to pay and rushing out before a table of 10 wanting individual bills."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the food as I just have a beer here at Montana.  Limited draft beers selections with the usual Coors Light, Canadian, Rickard's and Creemore.   I hang out at the bar for awhile waiting for my ride to pick me up and the service was ok.   Too bad there is no complimentary Wifi access. Just sport stations showing random programs....  Yawn...."}
{"text":"I know I know... it is Montana's Cookhouse.... Another one of those boring Chain Franchise Restaurants...But the BBQ is good, the service is excellent...  Oven-Baked Antojitos ($9.99) Complimentary using a coupon - According to my dinner mate, they are spicy...  - Seasoned with Melinda hot sauce... which my waitress bring extra to my table - meh... especially if it is $10!! Not much substance in the dish... something I can just roll up and make at home  Pork Side Ribs and Quarter Chicken ($23.95) - Mouth Watering Chicken and Fall of the bones Ribs - The half rack is just the right size  - Chicken leg is moist and smoky! - All the sides are excellent!  Southwest Salad ($13.99) - Grilled steak, black beans, salsa, cucumber, corn, fried tortilla strips, dusted jalapenos and red pepper strips served over a bed of mixed field greens - It sounded good in the menu but just something lacking... I blame it on the Ancho Ranch Dressing on the side... - It just lack the kick to spice up the dish  The service is amazing. Our waitress is efficient and cheerful...   Now I just need to fill out a survey to get another free appetizer for my next visit! I think I will be back for more RIBS!  PS Please don't take me here for my birthday!! I don't want to wear that silly helmet!!"}
{"text":"This place closes at 11:00 pm every night I walked in at 10:45 pm and the manger told me sorry we are closed, what a nice welcome. If there was 0.5 stars I would rate that very bad way to kick a customer out, so this link is for the manger to read 1000 ways to be happy. http://hunternuttall.com/blog/2008/08/1000-ways-to-be-happy/"}
{"text":"Dropped by Montana's Cookhouse for lunch. The prices are really similar as what they offered at dinner time. The deals they have are the lunch set that includes non alcoholic drinks.   I got seated promptly and the bar area with 3 flat screen TVs at the sportnet channel. My waiter is nice and friendly. Decided on the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.. which he gave me a choice of fries, salad, veggie or SWEET POTATO FRIES with $1 surcharges. I just could not resist when he said sweet potato fries... :)   My food arrived within 15 min... so no free lunch this afternoon!   It is nice and relaxing to eat lunch at a quiet and near empty restaurant.   The chicken a little dry.. but the sauce is excellent.. because it is SPICY! and the sweet potato fries though a little burn..but I just love sweet potato!   Yes I will be definitely come again for lunch... I was in and out of the restaurant in 30 min!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here the other day for all you can eat ribs. It was not busy there was maybe 2 or 3 other tables in the whole place going it was not lunch hour. It was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant ordered an appetizer to start. The main dish was brought out and I had to ask where's the starter like where's the appetizer all I got was an apology and all go and get that for you so if my food goes under the heat lamp obviously they bring out the appetizer and it's  gross and soggy so i sent it back.. good bring out the food which was okay but no there is not very much meat on the ribs at all but then I SAT with an empty plate for a good 10 to 15 minutes before a manager and asked me if I wanted to order another rack of ribs this whole time my drink was empty as well. All in all it was the worst experience I've had and if I was you I would definitely avoid this place at all costs"}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch was about 3:30 in the afternoon when I got there. The place was next to empty only a couple tables had people at them. Waited to be seated as there was no body on the floor.. also noticed quite a few tables had dirty dishes still on them not yet cleared off. Waited a fair amount of time for the appetizer to arrive the food came out pretty much right as I was finishing the appetizer. The food wasn't too bad. The ribs were hot the potato could have been hotter as it didn't even know the butter. Had to wait for drink refills in fact had a different waitress asked if I would like a refill as she noticed the empty glasse sitting on the table. After I was done asked for the bill and had to wait for that.. I think I agree with a few of the other reviews that the wait times are a little bit long and the staff is a little bit slow and what they do. I am not sure if I will come back to this location I was just craving all you can eat ribs and it's the only place I know of that does it so that's why I went there."}
{"text":"I visited on a lazy Sunday. The food was sub par and the fries were gross! I feel as though the executive chef must have been off and that I must have had a rookie in the kitchen. I soon learned however through the waiter that the executive chef was in fact the one cooking! The fries seemed fried, dried and fried again. The cornbread was blue-ish green. I have never seen anything like it!  I mentioned the fries to the waiter however and they were friendly and understanding and even explained that they hated the food themselves! They took my meal off the bill which was very kind but for a chain the food quality was unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Ok as much as dislike writing bad reviews- I can't keep my mouth shut about this one.  I ordered 1 pound of their wings and the pulled pork bbq sandwich.  Ill start with the sandwich. The meat was cooked and seasoned well with a healthy portion of coleslaw on top. The coleslaw had definitely been dressed many hours before because it was soggy but the meat was hot and tasty. Unfortunately the roll they served it on wasn't toasted and it soaked up all the juices from the meat and coleslaw making it extremely soggy and sandy. So I'd give the sandwich a 3.5/5 because of the soggy coleslaw and bun.  But the reason i have an issue with this place is the pound of wings I ordered. After eating just one I realized I had made a mistake. The meat inside was very very dark and shiny which indicates that the wings were bad to begin with. I tore another one open and it was pinkish black inside...super insanely gross. I can't imagine why they served them to me in the first place. And not that it ruined the wings...but they weren't even sauced well.  I opted not to eat the rest of the wings and my stomach was in knots the rest of the day. I spent the next 24 hours on the toilet and for this reason I will not be back to Montana's...especially not for chicken wings.  Overall Food 2/5 Decor 3.5/5 Staff 2/5  Get it together Montana's and try not to poison your patrons"}
{"text":"They are getting the one star for service as the waitress and the manager really attempted to make up for the sub par items being passed off as food.  We used to go to Montana's quite often and expect fall off the bone ribs.  What we got was a kids meal with ribs, a kids meal with chicken strips, a ribs and wings combo and fish and chips.  We sent back both rib dishes as the ribs were dry and not chewable.  These were replaced by hamburger dishes, both burgers were VERY DRY and just as bad as the ribs.  The kids cookie dessert that is freshly baked tasted more like a stale day old cookie almost ready to hammer nails with.   SO UNFORTUNATE FOR MONTANA's my recommendation is to save your cash and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"We planned on doing a surprise birthday party for our mom(with the moose hat and the Montana's staff singing their own rendition of happy birthday to her) so we decided to invite her for dinner at Montana's(there were 6 of us altogether). She had no idea about the suprises(and horrors haha) Montana's subject their birthday celebrants to.   We had a reservation so we were seated quickly. Our sever was amazing - very personable and understood right away what we planned for our mom. Our orders were taken quickly and came within 40 or so minutes, which isn't too bad ad the place was packed. And we were having so much fun chatting with family we barely noticed the time.  We ordered mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich, ribs, paella, soup, and 2 different kinds of steak. The mac and cheese was alright, a bit on the dry side, but still okay. The ribs and steak were great, juicy and just the right amount of sauces/seasoning. The paella was pretty good as well - no complaints.   After dinner the waitress brought the free dessert(mud pie) and brought the moose hat which they put on our mom's head and started singing their Montana's birthday song. Definitely surprised our mom!   Overall, great place - service was amazing and food was good. Not going there for my bday though, cause I know that moose hat is waiting for me! Haha"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money.  Place was empty at 8 pm on Saturday night and they said it would be a 25 min wait because they were very busy and had a lot of parties.  They have over 15 empty tables and would not seat us.  I asked to speak to the manager and she just handed me his card.  I didn't bother arguing and just left."}
{"text":"Service was great, place was very busy so i was expecting everything to take forever. This was not the case,  I ordered the rib special which is all you can eat ribs, I tried 3 different flavors and never had to wait over 5 minutes for each kind. The other two only ordered salads and some kind of wraps but everything came out on time and we all really enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"We live in Bridlewood but my boyfriend and I were doing some shopping in Signal Hill. We had a lovely server in the bar area of the restaurant - super friendly, hillarious, easy going, beautiful smile and awesome personality! The food was amazing! And the Thursday $4 Tacos special is to die for.   When I first pictured $4 Tacos I was picturing some whimpy Taco Time Taco Tuesday stuff to be served. It was nothinggggg close. Tacos were stuffed full with lettuce and tomato, and LOTS of fresh chicken with the Kapow sauce!   Thanks for the awesome service and delicious food! Would definately be back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"Went for my daughter's birthday. Quality is way down. Service was slow and the food portions are much smaller. We told the hostess that it was my daughter's birthday and she told us that she would handle the desert. We got our bill and had to request the birthday desert. I ordered the 10 oz steak medium. It came well done and it was flavourless. Also, there is no more Moose hat."}
{"text":"Just the right amount of food at the right time. Sat at the bar for dinner two nights in a row. Different bartender (young ladies), same good service. They have a nice menu that allows for a little more up scale if you wish or you can stick with good 'ole fashion bar food. I had a steak and a glass of wine on night one and a burger and a beer on night two. Both were great and filled hte need for tasty food. There is one tough part about eating at the bar -- it is difficult to get close to your food. Hint: I used the menu to bridge the gap. I'll be back. (please read with Terminator accent)."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Montanas but this location deserves some credit. The service was very friendly, the place was spic and span and the food came FAST! The servers were very attentive and helpful and had no problem splitting our bill. They have a pretty good selection on the menu and right now they have all-you-can-eat ribs, EVERY day of the week, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"We chose Montana's on a Saturday around 6:00pm. We had about a 15 minute wait, but that's ok. We didn't mind. We just wanted food. Ashleigh was our server and she was great!   My wife has a shellfish allergy. Ashleigh was kind concerning that to make sure nothing went wrong.   We had the steak, ribs, wings, spinach dip. Our sons had the ribs and sliders. The food was good!  They were busy, so pre-bussing was not active.   My wife took a fork full of the baked beans and pulled out a hair!  She was grossed out!  Ashleigh came by and apologized. The manager came by and apologized, giving her meal for free. We weren't upset because things happen. The value of the staff and management team is that they apologized and were kind in rectifying the problem."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food.  The baby back ribs are awesome.  And so many terrific sauces to choose from.  I like to go Wednesdays for all you can eat baby back ribs.  But then, that's just me.  Same price as usual, but you get to eat as much as you like. Yum yum.  Spinach dip appetizer is always awesome too.   And the hot mini donuts?  OMG seriously!"}
{"text":"I love Montana's.   Awesome baby back ribs..... And I love all you can eat ribs Wednesdays!  Also love the beef brisket entrée.   The fish and chips is also good!   Great appetizers, awesome desserts... The donut holes are awesome!   Staff are always great too!"}
{"text":"The ribs, baby back, many yummy sauces, are excellent!   Especially love all you can eat ribs every Wednesday!   Their beef brisket is excellent, as are all the appetizers.  Soup is good too.  Their desserts are great too.  I especially love the donut holes, which are cooked to order and (should) arrive piping hot, to dip into yummy sauces! !"}
{"text":"Went here around opening time (11 AM) on a Monday.  The only person present was the bartender, well, someone in the bar area.  Anyway, turns out he was also our server.  His service wasn't bad, but the food was.  I ordered the salmon and the portion of salmon, rice, and vegetables were very small and mostly salty.  For dessert I ordered the cookie in a skillet (not sure of the correct name) - no flavour, just sugar and syrup."}
{"text":"An okay experience. Unfortunately our lunch took over 90 minutes, which was way too long.  Once the waiter seated us and asked if we were ready to order (after getting water) and we said we needed a few minutes, he disappeared for half an hour!  We kept trying to get his attention, but he wouldn't come back.  Finally, he came back and we were able to order.  The baked Smokehouse wrap was good, but a bit strange.  The wrap had chicken, bacon, rice, cheese and a fresh tomato salsa.  The wrap was baked, which melted the cheese. Not having either a BBQ sauce in the wrap or something to dip the wrap in was strange. It was a bit dry without any sort of sauce. I also would have preferred the rice on the side instead of inside the wrap.  The side caesar salad was fresh and crisp; great to see a caesar salad that actually has bacon because so many restaurants nowadays don't!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a workday.  Had the chicken Cobb Salad with double chicken.  The chicken was both under-cooked, and dried out looking, the extra add on avocado was disgusting.  It was less than a half an avocado, and it was mushy.  In fact I didn't know what it was at first.  The entire salad looked wilted and thrown together.  I tired some of my coworker's sweet potato fries and they were too thin, and too greasy.  The prices were ridiculous, as me salad would've come to $20 had I not complained and had it taken off my bill."}
{"text":"I thought of Montana as a dinner place, a place where I ordered steak and ribs.  So when BF suggested to have lunch at Montana, I was trekking out of my comfort zone.  I was surprised that it was open during lunch hours.  Even better, it had a lunch menu!  The least expensive offering was a Lunch Trio that costed $9.99.  It included a salad, a soup and half a sandwich.  Other things were mostly $10.99 and above.  I ordered a Brisket Chili ($10.99).  BF ordered a Lunch Trio with Turkey Sandwich as main, with chicken soup and garden salad ($9.99).  This was a great chili if you liked it thick and smokey and slight spicy.  It was satisfying and felt homey.  The sandwich was fresh.  The soup was standard canned soup.  Salad was good.    The place was not busy, so the services was sufficient.  Yet any busier, this place would have been understaffed.  All in all, Montana's lunch offering surprises me.  While it has fewer variety than Jack Astor's and Kesley's, what we have had are all fresh and well made.  Now I know Montana's is more than steak and ribs, I may visit more."}
{"text":"My favorite cookhouse restaurant in the city, I come here all the time mainly for the best pork ribs in town and they never disappoint! the service is always good and they are very friendly but not in a very annoying way like some other places, they update their menu all the time and add fun new items to try which always seem to work well, good selection of beers and other drinks as well. if you have room for desert you should definitely try some of their yummy cakes. There is a good atmosphere in the dining room, it has a family feel to it but at the same time there is a younger crowed vibe which is good, if I had one compliant it would be that it could use some more lighting, a bit too dim but I get it due to the wooden theme of the decor."}
{"text":"Service was good. However, the food wasn't. The ribs were tough, mashed potatoes were bland, and the baked beans were just awful. I won't be visiting them again."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the service was slow. However, the food was amazing, especially the chicken tacos. It's a must if you go there!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The waitress was VERY rude. The food took forever to come. They never came back to check on us to see if everything was okay. The food tasted okay. I will never return back to this location. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"I've only been to Montana's a handful of times, but I've always enjoyed myself each and every time.   Some of my favourite things about this place are as follows:   -          the staff are generally very friendly and personable, making it a different experience each time -          the food has never disappointed us, it's always fast and hits the spot -          the general atmosphere is lovely, with a nice family feel to it -          you're not paying out the bum bum for a decent meal -          if you're lucky enough to go on a birthday they make the birthday person wear a ridiculous moose hat to commemorate -          they have paper on the tables so you can draw, doodle, and play games through the meal  So, all those things in mind, doesn't that make Montana's seem like a nice place to dine for an evening?"}
{"text":"I often go to this Montana's location as it is the closer of the two, distance wise, to my house. I will be making the longer drive down to the location next to Silver City from now on as I've encountered numerous instances that show chaos with the organization of employees at this location.   This happened a month or two ago but I was put on hold for roughly 15 minutes. It would have been longer had I not gone to the restaurant to complain about the crazy amount of time to leave somebody on hold. When I told the hostess at Montana's, she merely shrugged it off and said, \"it happens, whoever picked up your call must have forgotten about you, clocked out and went home.\" I have no problem with the mistake that was made as I have worked in the industry before and forgotten about things as well. I however, know when an apology needs to be given and for the fact that the hostess I talked to didn't even remotely offer one up, it shows a lack of proper training on her part.   Last night, I visited this location again and the hostess ended up being our waitress. Not sure what happened there but it didn't strike me as a problem until later on. Usually almost immediately after you're seated, a waiter will come by and ask what you'd like to drink. My date and I discussed our menu for quite some time before I pointed out the lack of service we were getting. Eventually, the aforementioned hostess appeared and informed us she'd be our waitress for the evening. Fine by me! At this point she asked what we'd like to drink and gave us a few more minutes with our menus.   The dining experience itself was perfectly fine in terms of the food being of good quality and the taste of it being the same as usual. What really irked me was the lack of refilling of our obviously empty cups of water. Later on when we hadn't seen our waitress again for upwards of 30 minutes, I flagged down another waitress for more water. I also asked her to pack up the rest of my burger for me. Less than a minute later, our original waitress showed up with the bill. My date put his card but not before our original waitress had disappeared again. While we were waiting to pay, a waitress we hadn't seen earlier in the night appeared and asked if we had ordered the tacos... To my knowledge, the answer was no but it just goes to show the chaos between the waitresses and their usage of the system to take down orders. Eventually our waitress came back and we paid. The time it took to pay was roughly 15 minutes between her setting the bill down and coming back with the machine.   In all the chaos, they never gave me my burger back to take home.  -3 stars for several instances of disorganization during just ONE visit -1 star for never giving my burger back"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night.  This place has been around since I was in high school and always had pretty good memories of it.  What was not good at this place though was their salted caramel dessert. It was terrible.  It was just like eating pure caramel which was way too sweet for me.  The only salty part was they put pretzels in it but it didn't make a difference at all.  Other than that some of the food isn't too bad but it's not the greatest either.  They took out their fried ice cream which I'm sad about."}
{"text":"We have been to this Montana's location a number of times when we don't feel like cooking and want to get quick comfort food. There is never a line here and there's plenty of seating, so we're always seated immediately. And plenty of parking in the Vaughan Mills parking lot!  If you fill out the online survey using a previous receipt, they will give you a free appetizer. This is a great deal, since we usually get either the hand-dusted calamari (essentially fried calamari) or the four-cheese spinach dip (refills on the pita chips are free). For entrees, I really like the chipotle firecracker burger, a nice spicy burger with crispy onions. Yum! The New York steak sandwich is also a good choice and is quite filling. Their ribs are also quite delicious."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat dinner here, but we had to get up and leave after waiting an hour and not seeing any food. The terrible experience started with the hostess...no personality and just generally seemed clueless. After 10 minutes, I had to get up and ask if anyone would be taking our drink order. We finally got drinks and food ordered. About 40 mins later the kids at our table received their meals. We were told ours would be out shortly. After waiting another 20 minutes, we told the hostess our meals could be cancelled. Also, a note that she walked over to ask us if we were missing a fish and chips....there was no food on our table! When the manager finally turned up, he seemed confused and didn't know what to say. Literally the entire evening was a disaster. If you see a large group enter, RUN! This place clearly cannot handle a large group while simultaneously feeding other people. Thank you Montana's for a terrible evening and experience for our friends visiting from the UK. We will be sure to avoid this chain whenever we visit Canada."}
{"text":"Calling the service terrible is insulting to the word terrible.  Walked in at 9pm Wednesday to no hostess at the door.  Walked into a sparsely populated bar. Sat down and waited... And waited...  8 minutes later, still no acknowledgment at the bartenders. The three there were busy, though.  One was ignoring everyone at the bar looking bored, one slowly cleaning the bar, and one flirting with old men for tips.   Needless to say, I left.  I suggest you do the same and don't bother, they'll be closed soon based on everyone's experience."}
{"text":"This place is a massive fail, and whoever owns it should be embarrassed and whoever manages it should be fired.  Food was okay, but speed, service, timing, everything, was some of the worst I've had.  Six of us showed up at 8pm; they weren't busy but it took 5 minutes to get a table.  We ask for a round of waters and then are never asked if we want anything else.  Before placing our orders, we are informed that they are out of 2 of their 3 steaks, and baked potatoes.  We start placing orders, and after 3 people order the 1/4 chicken, our waiter checks to make sure they have enough..comes back, and says they do, so 2 of us also order 1/2 chickens.  20 minutes later we get our salads (no refills on the waters still).  Salads finished, waiter comes out, says sorry, they're actually out of chicken so the last 2 of us have to order something else.  Wtf?  We order again, everyone else's food is brought out, we hang out for 10 minutes while we're waiting for it to show up.    The service wasn't the only issue.  Nobody was impressed with their food and it's overpriced for what you get.  Do not go here, there have to be better options in the area.  Like McDonalds."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their specials.   If you come here for their specials, it's a pretty good deal. Such as 1/2 price apps everyday after 9 pm or their daily deals!  We came here after 9 pm so we took advantage of their 1/2 price apps. Even wings are half price!! And I bet not a lot of ppl knew that. I ordered their nachos which are usually very good too and their signature dish kapow shrimp.   I liked the chicken wings for being big and still had enough wings to go around for two ppl. The kapow shrimp was not so good though. The breaded crumbs tasted a bit off as if it was stale. There was a funny taste to it. We ordered the nachos with pulled pork on it and I thought there wasn't enough pulled pork on it. Just a few shreds here and there.   The service was alright. She got everything we needed and the food came at a relative good pace. When we asked to get our nachos reheated she was happy to do so for us.   Last tip?!  Even ordering just on the appetizers was enough for us. We were so full so it's good to take advantage of their app specials. The only thing is it's not the real food like steak and pasta."}
{"text":"What to try?  Come here on Mondays or Wednesdays. On Mondays you get the wings special (1/2 off!!!) or on Wednesdays you get all you can eat ribs! If you're a true fan of ribs or wings you wouldn't miss out on these days right? I had the wings tonight because it was a Monday and for a pound of wings it's about $7 so really, it's worth it to come on Mondays. The wings were huuuge and I like that other than the typical chicken sauces, you can order the rib sauces on your wings too!! We also ordered the Mac and cheese but I thought it was meh. The pasta tasted over cooked and the sauce didn't taste like it was absorbed into the pasta. The wings can get filling because of its size and the breeding on it, so don't order too much other stuff if you're ordering 3 lbs of wings like us!  The service was very slow though. Waited about 20 min for the food to arrive and it wasn't very busy on a Monday night. Maybe there were not a lot of cooks at the back. I had a scene card but they didn't say anything about scene. So unless you tell them, they're not going to ask!!  Last tip?  Specials like half priced wings on Mondays and $6 tacos on Thursdays start at 8 pm. For ribs, it's on Wednesdays and it's all you can eat anytime for dinner!! Bring your scene card and present it before paying. As well, sign up for emails so you can get offers from time to time! On birthdays, you wear a moose hat and you get a free dessert!"}
{"text":"Both times I've gone here was terrible. The first time we had a really snotty hostess/bus girl that acted like she ran the place. You could tell she was very new as well so I gave her the benefit of the doubt until she started making remarks to another waiter about me and my boyfriend. The second time I went she thankfully wasn't working, but I ended up getting food poisoning from their steak. It was also the driest and toughest steak I've ever tasted. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"I have been to a few locations and have experienced many different levels of pain after eating certain meals.  This was the Worse.  I will give the good news.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly and quick to help us.  However, there was nothing the waiter could do to save the food.  My guests and I shared some appetizers and we each ordered a sandwich with a side order of fries/salad.  The two steak sandwiches smelled like animal feces and my pulled pork sandwich looked like it.   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"For a family-style, relaxed kind of restaurant, the food was fabulous. Service was friendly but a little slow. That I can live with for food this good. Best fried pickles I ever had!  The only gripe I had was that our appetiser came out, then not 3 minutes later,  our burgers arrived. The waitress offered to keep them warm for us,  but we made do. Worth it. Everything was hot.  Next time I'd tell them to bring the appetiser, then we'll order dinner after it arrives."}
{"text":"Not what i expected, the waiter couldn't have cared less about us. We went late at night there was barely no-one and we couldn't get a waiter. We needed to ask for most of our refills, she did not give us cutlery so we had to ask. She didn't give us napkins so we had to ask, the wait was quite long for this kind of restaurant, she seemed rude and unhappy, the only time she cared about us was when she gave us the bill, before our meal was even done which i find very rude. I am the kind of person to always leave a minimum of 15% tip, because to me it is right, for the first time in years i felt like even 10% was too much highly disappointing."}
{"text":"This location is our go-to for family nights out that are not too frequent. The kids menu is awesome and the staff here have always been friendly, but not in that obvious over reaching, only nice for a tip way. That make sense? We love BBQ and to draw on tables so how can you lose? seriously though, we've only had to wait for a table twice and it was a reasonable wait time. We love that they have kids night and new items all the time."}
{"text":"Decent service. Horrible food . Ordered 3 appetizers and couldn't finish even one of them. Waste of time and money"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see such positive reviews for this location of Montana's, because I've experience some pretty appalling bad service here. In particular, the service is really slow during lunch hours.   But there is a reason that I come back here every now and then- their oven-baked antojitos. It's a spicy blend of cheese, jalapeño, onion and red pepper, rolled up in a flour tortilla and oven-baked till it all melts together and it's served with pesto sour cream. I would often order this as my meal, even though it's only an appetizer. It's just so good! How can you resist rich, spicy goodness wrapped up in a cheesy roll?   I find Montana's ribs to be a hit or miss. On this occasion, we ditched the ribs and opted for beer battered fish and chips: beer-battered haddock fillets, cooked to a golden crisp and served with tartar sauce, coleslaw, fries and a fired-grilled lemon to squeeze over top. It was actually pretty good! Even though the fish looked burned, that wasn't the case. The fish was moist and flaky beneath the crispy batter. They were certainly better than the ones from Jack Astor's, which are often overcooked. The fries were mediocre, so I didn't have too much of that.  For dessert, my boyfriend really loves their mild high mud pie: espresso chocolate flake ice cream layered with creamy peanut butter and chocolate on a crunchy cookie crust, all topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. You have the option of ordering half the mile only, which we did here. I think the full version would have been a little too much.   All in all, I do like coming back to Montana's once in awhile, but I've had serious service issues here before. Other than that, the food is decent, and I can't get enough of their antojitos!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but found the steak to be tough. They say its aged for 28 days but not really sure how true that is. We were 5 and all had steaks and all had the same comment on how tough the meat was!! Veggies were good and wine list very limited."}
{"text":"Good service, but the same cannot be said for the food. We ordered the Surf n' Turf to start, and while it was good, the portion was a little small for $13. We got about 4 pieces of 'turf' - a sirloin steak and 5 pieces of 'surf' - a deep-fried shrimp that was coated in their Kapow sauce. l was expecting a bit more for $13! We ordered a steak, a mac n'cheese and chicken tacos. The latter two were okay (although they arrived cold). The steak, however, was ordered medium rare, but it arrived well done. It was already cut into 5 pieces, which was odd. The steak was then sent back to the kitchen. When the steak came back, though, it was even worse than before. We ordered a medium rare steak, and got back a blue rare steak! Like the last, it was cut into 5 small pieces, and to top it off, that steak was cold too.  The atmosphere is nice, and the service is okay, but the food is subpar. I won't be returning to Montana's."}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the food we ordered at this Montana Restaurant.  I had the Beef Brisket Sandwich with Caesar Salad.  The beef brisket in that BBQ sauce was so good!  The sandwich was cut into 2 for easy eating.  The Caesear Salad was fresh and tossed with that creamy casear dressing and fresh shavings of asiago cheese and real chopped up bacon.  I normally don't like bacon but this one time, the bacon tastes really good with the casear salad.    The rest of the party ordered the goat cheese, vege penne in a tomato sauce - so delicious with the goat cheese melding in with the tomoato sauce.  Another ordered the mealoaf special and liked the food.    Everything came out piping hot.  Service was fast.  We like that."}
{"text":"Steaks in a steakhouse not properly cooked: rare was closer to medium and tough. Difficult to cut with a steak-knife and difficult to chew. Server offered to get a new one but the rest of the family would probably be ready for dessert by the time I started to eat my meal. As well, my clothes kept sticking to the plastic tablecloth that hung over the edge of the table. Needless to say I didn't try for dessert."}
{"text":"do not get the 7 oz hand carved steak. its a small skinny piece of steak that has no flavour. i asked for seasonal veges and i literally got 3 small boiled broccoli flowers and 3 tiny cauliflower crowns.  im still hungry. whats for dinner?!   will never go here again."}
{"text":"I do enjoy the food here, but when I ordered the chicken stuffed with pulled pork, the portion was very small and I actually left hungry. Service was great however. I would never order that meal again tho."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this Montana's in ages and it's changed quite a bit, for the better luckily. As a kid I felt the restaurant had a certain tackiness to it but it's really improved since then. Everything looks more authentic somehow.  Server was friendly and checked up on us often. Selection of drinks was good, as was the selection of appetizers (deep fried pickles are the best). Being a chicken parm snob I wanted to see how Montana's stacked up. Chicken was ok but I wasn't a big fan of the pasta sauce - too creamy for my liking. Garlic bread was tasty and had a generous amount of cheese on it. I just wish the piece of bread was bigger.   Overall a good experience, will visit again but I'll have to actually try the burgers/ribs Montana's is known for"}
{"text":"Came in here since we stayed at the airport hotel on our last night which was across the street. We split a Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, it was pretty good, the chicken was very tender. I also ordered a Fire-Grilled Top Sirloin Medium Well w/ a side of Coleslaw. I don't know if the knife was sharp or not I had a hard time cutting the Sirloin, other then that the meal was very good. My friend ordered Deep Fried Pickles, Nashville Crispy Chicken Sandwich w/ a Chicken Taco, he loved the whole meal."}
{"text":"Typical Cara Foods owned mid-range suburban \"BBQ\" joint. Not great but not terrible, if anything it's consistently 'ok'. Always have the Jay's game on the screens and service is never terrible. If it is there's usually a manager onsite to take over like most other Cara owned restaurants. The one good thing about big restaurant chains is the commitment to customer service and food safety. Wouldn't be my first choice in the area but not the worst place in the world especially if you're trying to catch playoffs without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to get take out from this restaurant. I called it in around 8 and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. After waiting an extra 20 minutes, we were informed that they had accidentally discarded the order and it'd be another 15 minutes. Before my husband could say anything, the manager promptly comped our meal and the waiter who took our order bought him a beer while he waited. This location went above and beyond more than they needed to to correct what was an honest mistake. Will definitely recommend this location for their excellent customer service and friendliness."}
{"text":"Disappointed with my Filet Mignon at the Quesensway location. It was so loaded with meat tenderizer that the top tasted like it was disintegrating. Not worth the price. Back to The Keg for my steaks!"}
{"text":"We went here before going to watch a movie. We have only been to this location once. The service was quite slow - we were served by the bartender rather than an actual server. This led to her really only spending time with the customers at the bar.   I ordered a RIB/Brisket platter and my wife ordered a burger. Over all I remember the food being much better. My bbq was decent but the sides weren't very tasty. In addition to that my wife had not enjoyed her burger and had let the waitress know. She told us the burgers are world famous and that people come from all over the taste them - she must have an acquired taste.   We ended up asking for our bill and leaving with maybe 2 interactions with her. Not a very pleasant experience and we probably won't return."}
{"text":"Food wasn't the best burger was a little dry and the order was messed up. Ordered appetizers but got our entrees first. Told the waiter and she apologized and forgot  I was like um ok. It wasn't really busy or anything but or food did take forever."}
{"text":"Sadly this establishment doesn't do as well as others in the chain. Fries are too salty and not crisp. The burgers are dry and taste over cooked. Overall a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I came to Montana's with my boyfriend with absolutely no expectations (first time for both of us) we had seen the not so great reviews but we had a $20 gift card and were planning to go to the Cineplex in the same plaza so we went to Montana's for a Saturday night dinner pre-Planet of the Apes. I have to say we were very impressed. I enjoyed the Canadiana decor and the place had a cool family vibe. The food was pretty good and the prices were reasonable. Also the desserts are cheap and offered in small sizes. Saturdays they have $5 Caesars and pretty decent drink specials the rest of the days. I had the 7oz AAA sirloin with creamy shrimp, Cajun fried onions, coleslaw and fries. I asked for my meat to be medium rare and it came out perfectly. Everything was very tasty. This plate is $24.99 and it's not the cheapest steak option. My boyfriend had a combo of ribs (6) and wings (4) with fries, coleslaw and corn bread... very good! This plate is $24.99 and it wasn't the cheapest ribs and wings combo (there's a 4 ribs - 4 wings for $19.99). We also shared a mini apple cobbler with ice cream ($2.99), it was a delicious way to end our meal. Service was quick and attentive.  I am converted."}
{"text":"We ended up here after trying many places in neighborhood all full due to UFC. This was our first and last time. Our server was terrific and so helpful but the food quality is beyond bad   Spinach dip app arrived cheese not even melted, we ordered steak and a fried chicken sandwich for mains, had to send steak back it tasted burnt and rotten.  My chicken sandwich was overlooked and bun stale but we split it due we didn't want too chance anything else.  The manager was very nice and took steak off the bill but we left very unsatisfied and hungry   Front of the house is def not the problem here the problem is definitely in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is traditional birthday dinner spot for our family-very young kid friendly.  I recently stumbled across their kids eat free Tuesday deal and decided to hit it for my son's birthday.  We all had a great meal and they even had a balloon artist/magician for entertainment which the kids loved.  The celebration was capped off by a birthday song from the servers and the chance to wear an antler helmet.  We all left full and happy!"}
{"text":"If you like Boston Pizza or Chili's you will LOVE Montana's!  Bleah!   Steak sandwich was way overcooked.  Couldn't enjoy it with the over kill of sweet caramelized onions.  And they ran out of the panini bread that it came with so they put it on a hamburger bun...classy  Greek salad was ok, but definitely not Greek Greek but better than Broken Plate, which is sad.    Hubby had a burger of sorts, looked like a spicy Wendy's chicken crisp, so not worth the $14 because the fries were horrible.  Wanted to order a steak but they ran out of corn, and another side so he just settled and it was only 7:00pm  Kids meals were ok, because of the cardboard truck \"plate\" but nothing stellar.  Ordered some corn bread muffins for the kids to pick on while they waited for their meals, they were alright, probably the best part of the meal.  Also the Kapow shrimp was really good and spicy and preferred that to my main.    Server was nice, the two stars are for her otherwise would have given them only one.  Probably won't go back, unless invited."}
{"text":"The crackling chips were just normal pork rinds served with a BBQ sauce, nothing amazing and tasted like something that can be bought from the grocery store snack isle. The kapow shrimp was not like it's name, it lacked that kick from the jalapeño, garlic and Thai chili. The fried chicken bites were better and the fried onion strings were delicious.  Was told Montana's has great ribs so decided to try that instead of getting steak. It was really disappointing, the ribs were not fall off the bone tender. Apparently, Montana's changed their ribs to a rip off the bone style and its smoked in house now. Even the brisket couldn't save the entree. Talked to the manager about the rib fiasco and he offered the table dessert on the house. The skillet cookie was great, it got to the table hot. A bite of cookie with a bit of ice cream was the perfect end to the meal.  Overall, probably won't be coming back. Need to find another place with better ribs."}
{"text":"Server, Victoria was friendly, attentive and all smiles.  Kids received food really fast.   Fire cracker burger was delicious.  Chicken fingers were fine.  Adult meals were sirloin steaks (45 mins ?) seemed kitchen lost order.  Came out tough  Ribs were dry.  Double dusted wings were great.   Assist Mgr was on top of mistaken orders. Listened and corrected issues.  Went the extra efforts to make corrections and follow up too.  Thank you."}
{"text":"What can I say.  I rarely go here but for some reason, my fam wanted ribs and things.  So after going through the various options - we decided to try Montana's once again.  Let me state for the record, the fam has not been here for over 2 years!  I don't even remember why we haven't been back - probably because we don't eat this type of food often.  We had steak, ribs, chicken - all veg-heads beware...!  Overall the food was OK.  The ribs were kind of thin on the meat, the steak was not done to the right temperature, and the rest of the food was OK.  Beer was good though!  Parking is a challenge here as movie goers clog the lot, with Indigo shoppers and Kelsey patrons.  There is a small lot behind Montana's that you can find a spot - if you are lucky.  For those looking for some value, make sure you check your mail.  Montana's is constantly sending out meal deals.  Barely eeks out 3 stars for me.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second chance as last experience at this specific location a few years ago was not a positive one. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient.  We came in for appetizers & recommend the antojitos..very good."}
{"text":"With these chain restaurants it could be a hit or miss and this time for me it was a miss. I ordered the rib platter to go and the hostess said it would be about 15 minutes which was fine. When I got there I had to wait awkwardly at the bar waiting for the bartender so I could pay for my meal. Eventually the bartender was able to help me out which was great but I felt bad for her because she was alone and it was slightly busy for her to be both bartender and waitress for the tables in the area.  When I got home I was disappointed with the Texas BBQ ribs I got. They were slightly too salty and were dry with not that much meat on the ribs which was weird because it was only 8:10pm when I picked up my food. I don't think I'll be getting ribs from this Montana's again."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience here every time I go.  Our waitress was very nice and got our drinks right away. I got the apple pecan salad. It was tasty but the apple was cut like slices you would eat on its own. Too big, should have been thinner so I could spear my fork with.  My friend got the chipotle firecracker burger and he said he really enjoyed it.  Will come here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This might be the saddest excuse for BBQ I have ever experienced. I have nothing positive to add to the post, I mean nothing! The \"Brisket\" was basically deli meat and there is no way this meat ever saw a smoker! The \"Baked Beans\" we're awful and virtually had no beans in my serving, just sauce. Stay clear and enjoy dinner elsewhere!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences and food quality in my life .  Arrived around 6pm. The place was half empty and nobody came to greet us at the door for about 15 minutes.    Later we were Sat at a wobbly table next to the door.  I ordered the all you can eat ribs with sweet potato fries and my wife ordered the 8oz steak with rice pilaf and beans . We were told there was no 8 oz steak available. Wtf  were in a steak house and u don't have an 8oz steak.  So she went with the 6oz instead .   The food took 30 minutes to arrive in a half empty place on Wednesday and when it did arrived it was cold and didn't seem fresh.  The order was completely wrong . Instead of sweet potato I was served fries. The ribs were cold like it was sitting out for a few hours . My wife's steak was completely dry and hard like a rock . There was no wild rice pilaf . Was served fries again.   Not only that,  there was no utensils .  You want us to eat with our fingers? We confronted the server and was told there were no wild rice pilaf available and no sweet potato fries . So we sat there waiting for another 15 minutes waiting for our utensils and still not arrived .  That was it. We had enough . Told the server this wasnt accepetable the food wasn't edible and you didn't gave us utensils with the food and everything was completely wrong. We got up and left."}
{"text":"Wait was excessively long. The kids weren't happy but they handled it like champs! I didn't. It was so annoying to see all the empty tables and not enough wait staff to seat us. There is no great waiting area for that many people, so it was crowded and no one was really happy. They started telling people they were out of ribs too. Not a big deal for me, but I saw the natives getting restless.   So, I'm hungry, it's crowded and the rib-lovers were getting fired up - not the best way to start a relaxing evening out.   We finally get seated and I will say the booth was big and comfy and I do enjoy coloring on the table cloth, so one of the two stars is for that! The food was good but the waiter was new and didn't know much. Can't blame a guy for being new - but I can blame the restaurant for not having him shadow someone that did know stuff.   Overall, my belly was happy but that's about it - the rest of the experience was pretty crappy.  I am not even sure this deserves 2 stars, but I won't take away the one for them letting me color on the paper table cloth.  Food is good - fix the staff issues and I'll consider coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of the BEST chain restaurants to take a friend on there Birthday (i'll get to that reason later on). Two of my girlfriends were celebrating there birthday so i decided to take them here for some dinner. The hostess were nice and were seated at a booth in the dining room. The table was a wooden picnic table and it had brown paper covering it and crayons to write on. Our waiter Phil came over and wrote his name on the table and went over the specials with us. He was such an amazinggg waiter I must say! Always cheery and grreat with service. I alerted him that 2 ppl in the party were here to celebrate there birthdays and he said he'd take care it. We were taking forever to order because we couldn't stop gabbing but he gave us tons of time no rush.   For drinks I got the Lemonade - Perfect balanace of sweet and tartness no complaints and I Love that they serve the drinks in Mason Jars.  Mains ordered at the table included a mix of the Cookhouse Top Sirloins and Smokehouse Pork Ribs.  I ordered the Cookhouse Top Sirloin - A tender, juicy Canadian AAA top sirloin, aged 28 days. Fire-grilled to order with  crispy Cajun onions. You also get a choice of Southern Baked Beans, Kicked-up Corn or Coleslaw, and one side. I went with the beans and fresh vegetables. I love the beans here they have great smokey flavour. My steak was soo big and juicy, it was bigger than the others who ordered steaks, the only difference was that I ordered mines medium-rare everyone else ordered theres medium-well.   We also thought the steaks came with cornbread but it only came with the ribs meals. However Phil was soo amazing he brought a plateful for the table on the house. They cornbread here is also really good, a buttery sweet flavour.  After our meals Phil cleared up the table and handed us the dessert menu to browse. He then alerted me he was going to round up the staff to come out for the birthday surprise for my friends. All the staff came out clapping and chanting there birthday song, the whole restaurant participated and they put a giant viking hat with hugeee horns on them while they sang and clapped. It was sooo histerical!!!! A great birthday memory!!  Finally Dessert orders included :  Apple Cobbler - Freshly baked apples with cinnamon, brown sugar and crunchy oatmeal crumble. Topped with a blueberry apple sauce and vanilla ice cream. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it  But I had to have my Favourite Dessert!  Mile High Mud Pie A mountain of layers. Espresso chocolate flake ice cream layered with creamy peanut butter and chocolate ice cream on a crunchy chocolate cookie crust. Topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. I decided to go for the 1/2 mile because I knew I couldn't tackle that whole mile (its massive). This is the ultimate choco/pb/coffeee lover's dessert and a great finish to any meal!  Overall spectacular service from our waiter Phil, a must for Birthday celebrations, great for large groups, awesome ribs and steaks and a superb dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Great food. Superb service. The owner/ manager stopped by and asked how everything was. Very nice touch. She went table to table and also was serving. Found out she is the new owner. Tuesday 40% of select menu. Place filled up fast. I'm from Rochester NY. If there was a Montana's back home I would be here often. Kudos on the everything."}
{"text":"We're from Peterborough but we had the opportunity to eat in this notable Whitby chain restaurant. Why four stars? It all comes down to service. We had service that was effortlessly above and beyond. The atmosphere was not loud or jarring and kudos to the staff for paying attention to the little things. The food was slow to come from the kitchen despite the relatively low number of customers.  A special thank you to Brooklyn who absolutely charmed my 10-year old boy with her thoughtful professionalism.  And the food was pretty good, too!  A great place for a relaxing bite or brew."}
