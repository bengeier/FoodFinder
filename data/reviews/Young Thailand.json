{"text":"One Friday night, we decided to have a nice dinner in this restaurant. It looked like really nice Thai restaurant. The appetizers were amazingly tasty. We ordered calamari. Then some beef and duck. The waiters were very friendly. The evening started to look promising. Not until I saw something crawling on my plate and then on the table. Later I realized that it was a cockroach. I started screaming and the only reaction I got from the waiter is that this cockroach came from the outside and there is no way it could have come from their kitchen. The evening was spoiled. I wanted to threw up but I had to wait till the waiter brought us the check. I was surprised that no apology was offered and they did not wanted to admit that they have cockroaches. Cockroaches don't live outside! Anyway, if you are happy to eat food from the kitchen full of cockroaches, please go head and dine in this fine Thai restaurant or even better - you should do a take out!"}
{"text":"I've had some really great food from this restaurant.  I love their spicy eggplant dish and, while they are a bit pricey, I've never been disappointed.  And they have very nice staff, as well."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went with great expectations after reading how authentic the food is and all! Much to our amazement, it was such a letdown! It all started with our Tom Yum soup! It looked and tasted like water with Tom yum paste mixed in it! Nothing authentic about it! Red curry tasted of overwhelming coconut curry in it! All in all, I would not go again and i will not recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Extreme slow service.   Small portion.  Too much msg.  Will not return to the restaurant for sure"}
{"text":"this review is ONLY for the one on King street, I have never been to the other location.  the food there has been (for the last 2 yrs) consistently great. I have never been disappointed. My boyfriend and I love the spicy mixed sea food,  the soya noodles and pad thai."}
{"text":"Have traveled many times to Thailand. Just moved into Cabbagetown and found this authentic slice of Thailand. Great family style Thai food. Really enjoyed the Royal Pad Thai and Ginger Chicken dishes along with the sweet goodness of a traditional Thai Iced Tea (Mmm, condensed milk!)"}
{"text":"I visited Young Thailand last night for a father's day celebration with my mom and dad.  The King and Strachan location is the most recent addition to the popular chain.  The decor is really cute and modern in purple, black and gray, with some Asian influences.  The service was good, with one small mis-step when trying to order a Bloody Mary, and the prices were very reasonable.  I had the Garlic Shrimp and Coconut Rice, my mother ordered a Seafood Curry with Jasmine Rice, and my father had a Spicy Seafood Combination.  We all enjoyed the food a lot.  The wine was very reaonable at $19.50 for a litre of house wine, and our total bill came to about $80.00 including tax and tip.  They also have take out with online ordering and I will be trying that out soon!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to be the first person to review this place, although I don't know how it hasn't been reviewed up to now, given the location on King St West.  Anyway, my wife and I bought (hastily) a vacation membership last year, and one of the benefits of said membership is discount dining at a wide variety of restaurants.  Young Thailand was one of them, and so we decided to treat ourselves, as we will be doing quite often to try to offset the considerable cost of the \"membership\" (see timeshare). The place was not too busy when we were there, so the service was prompt and friendly, the waitress seemed to appreciate my fumbling attempts at greeting & thanking her in Thai.  The food was very good, we had spring rolls to share which were crispy and delicious, and then my wife had the Green Curry which she really liked.  I had the tamarind duck, which was served up with some nice veggies, very tasty stuff, and the duck was not too fatty (which can often lead to me regretting the ordering of said bird).  On the whole a most agreeable experience and the fact that the place is owned, run and staffed by Thais just adds something you don't see in alot of \"Thai\" restaurants.  Kap kun kap Young Thailand!!  (Thank you Young Thailand)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Was in the area looking for a place to have a quick bite and read reviews on this place! Seemed good so decided to try it out.  Just like a lot of people have already mentioned, their Royal Pad Thai is to die for. Perfectly cooked rice noodles, tossed with large shrimp, chicken, vegetables, coconut milk, tamarind sauce and (literally) topped with a thin egg omelet. Peanuts on the side. It is so fresh!!! I love Thai food and this was definitely some of the better Pad Thai I've had.  The staff are very polite and check up on you every so often. It is quite large inside and for what seems to be an older building, they've renovated it inside to have a clean, presentable look. They use standard cutlery and even cloth napkins which was a nice touch.  Will be back! They seemed to have a lot of regulars that came in and not without good reason! Loved it."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. Found out about them through a friend who lived in Thailand and said this place was one of the few in Toronto that served authentic Thai food. The Royal Pad Thai is delicious and affordable. They also deliver."}
{"text":"I had been here several times and overall satisfied with the food and service. The last time I went I was disappointed. Myself and a friend had gone on Monday Apr 6 for an early lunch. We were the only ones there when we arrived. The service was great and food was what I had come to expect. While eating our mains a group of 15 came in and another group of 8. I understand it was a little hectic for them but we were totally ignored from that point on. We sat with our dirty plates in front of us with no acknowledgment, for over a half hour !  I asked 3 times for our bill when they were passing by and had no response until the third time. The bill came and there was no apology for leaving us like that and our plates were never taken away."}
{"text":"Great staff.  Could not have been nicer. I am glad I tipped well because after we ate the rain came down hard and we were stuck in the doorway.  The waitress came out and offered us umbrellas. That was a great nice gesture.  We also liked the food a lot.  My wife gave it a true, rare compliment.... She would eat here again.  I have had a number of pad thai since living in Thailand, and this was my favorite."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious. Their authentic pad thai is the best I've had in the city. Just make sure to eat in or pick-up because their online delivery service is awful!"}
{"text":"Food was served cold as it had been waiting in the kitchen while the staff had their lunch. The attitude when asking about why the food was cold was pretty much I don't care attitude. Excuse was that there where other customers which is lame as there where a total of 4 other people there plus us 3 and the others had finished their meals already. Maybe this was expected as we got the bad attitude already when asking if one of the meals came with rice.  Live in the area and has been there before but this was the last!"}
{"text":"This may seem like a strange review but I need to complain about the delivery time. We were told delivery would be an hour, so we ordered because that was the timing we wanted. It arrived in 25 minutes. By the time we were able to eat our food, it was cold and disappointing. I called to discuss it with them and they didn't seem to care. I would have ordered later if I had know. I'm just annoyed."}
{"text":"Over the years I've ordered take-out from Young Thailand many a time, and never really been disappointed.  The food is flavourful and seems fresh.  I've tried Cashew Chicken, Curry Chicken, Curried Beef, and other menu items - always with vegetable spring rolls - and have enjoyed all.  The reason for the 3 stars, is that I have also eaten in a few times, but have almost always been the only people in the restaurant.  I can tell they do a booming take-out/delivery business.   While dining in, I see the brown take-out bags going out non-stop.  But I can't help but wonder, what does everyone else know that I don't know, about why not to eat in?   Are they surviving on take-out business because those diners haven't discovered some awful secret?  I'll keep eating it until I find out, because I do really like it!"}
{"text":"I love the pad thai this place makes. I used to hate tofu but now I ask for extra tofu because of the way they fry it. Their lunch special keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I go to Young Thailand at least once a week.  My girlfriend thinks their Pad Thai is the best in the city and swears she could eat it every day and never get sick of it.  I tend to mix up what I order and have tried much of the menu, often getting the Pad See Ew or Thai Spicy Noodle, but I've never had a bad meal here and service has always been good.  The interior decor is really lacking, and mostly the reason for my 4 star review.  I try to mostly go for take-out, but with friends will often sit in, and the atmosphere is just so lacking that it puts me a bit ill at ease.  While service is good, there isn't much personality behind it (language barrier?) and I feel that might lead to a forgettable experience for some people.  That said, based on past experiences and how close it is to where I live, this is my thai staple in Toronto and I would definitely recommend it to anybody wanting thai takeout."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great, nice atmosphere, the food is tasty, the staff is very nice.  However, one deal-breaker - cockroaches. Twice."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonably priced. The royal pad Thai is fantastic. Tried several dishes and all were great. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner - server  was attentive, portions were a good size, nice decor and washrooms were clean.  You could take someone here for a date.  I had the curry pad thai with beef and my friend had pad thai with mix seafood. The dishes had just the right amount of beef and seafood (shrimps, squids, clams, scallops)."}
{"text":"Good food, great and super quick delivery service to downtown! My reliable, go-to Thai place."}
{"text":"Very VERY authentic Thai food. In fact, all their staff and chefs are Thai, no wonder their food is as good as Sukho Thai. They also offers 90+ meal choices on the menu. It is confusing for someone who's not familiar with Thai food, but the bright part is that you get to choose to taste unique Thai foods that are usually not available in other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"This review is based on the take out service as I have yet to sit down and eat in.  Firstly they have a lunch special combo which myself and colleagues at work regularly take advantage of. We keep a print out and all but one of the items is less than $10 and for that you get a good portion of the main dish plus a spring roll, salad and the soup of the day.   I usually always have either the mango chicken or the spicy lime lamb and they are always delicious.   The fewer times I have been in the evenings I have come across the same level of satisfaction in their food although it costs more and I do not get the extra sides but sometimes I do wish the staff can be more observant of customers walking in and not seem like they are in rush to take your order and get you out. This happens even when it is not busy inside.  Will go again this week to try their peanut curry chicken as it just caught my eye while writing this review."}
{"text":"This review is based on a few times that I've been to Young Thailand for lunch pickup.  I have to say I love the Crispy Cashew Chicken.  Has a great mix of crunch and savory.  Very flavorful indeed but the reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the portion sizes are very inconsistent.  I've had the dish 3 or 4 times now and each time either it was almost all chicken with no vegetables, or mostly vegetables and a few pieces of chicken.  The dinner portion is reasonably priced, about $13 including tax (rice not included).  The gilled red snapper is also very good, a bit pricier but that's to be expected.   Naturally takes a bit longer to prepare but it's fresh, not greasy and comes with some tasty veg."}
{"text":"Really nice for the first time ordering here. I got the red curry, pad thai, and spring rolls. Service was excellent and food was quite enjoyable.  When picking up the food the staff was pleasant and this is nice a touch. Place was a little dated and a little pricey..  However, it is very convenient so I don't mind.."}
{"text":"Tasty food and very clean and nice ambience, staff are polite and lovely, I has shrimp spring roll for appetizer and one of the curry stews with peanut , both super tasty, a friend of mine had pad Thai which was fine but I didn't like the taste of the oil in it. We didn't have to pay for the parking on Saturday night which was a bonus :D."}
{"text":"Good food and great service - something you don't always find together.  Love the Royal Pad Thai but also the cashew chicken.  Good prices and always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Very adequate service. Good simple food. Amazing price. I felt like I was ripping the place off for the price."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it was near St Mike's Hospital.  I could walk there with friends on a beautiful summer afternoon.   Food is good and prices fair - seemed to be better at the old location including service  This was the first Thai restaurant I ever tried and I was hooked. Thai cuisine is so fragrant and interesting.   Perhaps they will relocate to west GTA?"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced for lunch, but expensive for dinner.   Food quality and portions are fairly large. Modifications are no problem here which is great!"}
{"text":"Stepped into this place with 3 friends for a quick dinner after a swimming session nearby.  The place was near deserted on a Wednesday night but it just meant very speedy and attentive service for us.  I ordered a Tom Yum soup to start while opting for the shrimp & chicken pad thai as my main.  The Tom Yum soup was sour and spicy and was a good choice to whet my appetite for the main course.  The portion of pad thai was pretty generous and came with bean sprouts, peanut crumbles, and a lime wedge on the side.  Enjoyed both dishes and it came out of the kitchen quickly too."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I ordered for take out during game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals and firstly we were happy to get a free order of spring rolls just because our order was over $40.00 so that was pretty cool. We ordered a plethora of items - everything was great. Everyone's had thai food here and there and honestly i've had so much thai food I was pretty tired of it. This restaurant reignited my passion for the cuisine. In fact it was so good later that night my friend put together all the left overs into a mish-mash impromptu meal and that was pretty darn yummy. Definetly one of the  better thai resto's in t.o."}
{"text":"Went here in about a year ago. The food is pretty good as long as you enjoy thai food. Lots of seating space and service is fine. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Good food. Average price too. The lamb basil and the duck Curry were pretty good as well. However, I have never been to a Thai restaurant where they do not give rice along with the curries. We had to buy extra rice for $3 a plate. The rice was just enough for one person so add that to the cost of your plate whatever dish you get. Service was fine. Large seating space. Quick service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the 2nd time.  First time was not a great experience several months ago.  Decided to give this place a second chance being that it is in my hood.  Ordered the Chicken Panang curry and spring rolls.  This Panang curry was an insult to Thai cuisine.  Forget about that the chicken was over cooked, but the curry itself was watered down and bland.  Anyone who has ordered this dish before knows that it's thick and pops with big flavour.  I honestly feel after this experience that this restaurant has no passion for thai food and if they did it's completely gone.  The only thing I positive I can say is that the spring rolls were above average and the only enjoyable part of my take out order."}
{"text":"Craving green curry, I was excited to try this place since it was directly across the street from my office. I'm comparing it to green curry (with vegetables + tofu) that I've had from other Thai restaurants nearby.  I was really disappointed. Rice isn't included with the meal, which is fine, but the 'add-on' brown rice portion is pretty small. The curry sauce wasn't particularly amazing, and most of the vegetables were lettuce. A little spinach, a couple of pieces of broccoli, one sliced carrot. Meh.  The tofu was...unfortunate. It was pretty mushy.  The meal wasn't awful, but it just wasn't great. Perhaps the meat items are better, but when it comes to curry vegetables + tofu, I won't be coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Their take-out menu and website state it to be the \"First Thai Restaurant in Canada\". While I have no ability to deny or support its claims, here is what I do know...  We ordered delivery from here and although I did enjoy the spring rolls and chicken wings, both mains that we received were terrible. Pad thai was really bland, I mean the worst pad thai I've had in years, and the Stir Fried Vermicelli Noodles were moderately better but still a disappointment.  I can't only enjoy appetizers and give this anything better than 2 stars."}
{"text":"Husband and I were walking along King West looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and we happened upon this place.  The decor is very cute, and the server was very attentive.  My husband drinks alot of water with a meal, and his water glass was never empty :)  Seeing as we were there for a quick lunch, we both ordered lunch specials.  The Pad Thai with chicken was reasonably priced and the portion size was good.  It was quite flavourful.  Lunch is served with a small starter plate that includes a salad (crisp and tasty), a spring roll (excellent - my favourite part of the meal), and a bit of hot and sour soup (neither of us cared for the soup, the smell alone was really a turn off, not sure why).  We would stop off for lunch again if in the neighbourhood, but wouldn't go out of our way to come here."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai with their  \"Royal Pad Thai\" that I have ever had. If I want Thai I get it from this place."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've had in a restaurant. My pad thai was completely bland, and so was my chicken. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"This place has arguably the BEST pad thai in the city BUT their service is horrible. Awful. Terrible. Worst ever.  I've had three orders totally messed up by them. One took 2 hours to deliver (and they refused to comp anything), second one -- they told me they sent my order to the wrong apartment in my building and asked me to check for them (and they didn't), and last time, I placed an order online that they never apparently received and they cannot confirm whether or not my credit card was charged. I asked them to look into it and they didn't even take down my information...   I will NEVER EVER EVER call this restaurant again. In this day and age, this type of service should be enough to shut down a restaurant."}
{"text":"Coconut soup was tasty and loaded with mushrooms and veggies.  The pad Thai (my staple dish to judge how good a restaurant is ) was almost perfect.  It jut needed a bit of spice to liven the flavour up- but the server was helpful in getting us some hot sauce.  I'll definitely go back and try the rest of the menu out.  FYI loads of free parking in back & the chefs are from Thailand."}
{"text":"On the front cover of the menu, it has the restaurants name and in quotation marks \"First Thai Restaurant in Canada\". Sounds like a pretty serious claim. The meal was on!  There was another location in my old neighborhood of Cabbagetown, and I'd heard it wasn't that good, but I had just had a good day and wanted to celebrate with some Thai food and it was the only one close by, so I thought I'd go check it out for myself.   The place wasn't too busy, but a large party had just left so I thought that was a good sign. The atmosphere is nice but not stuffy. Tables are comfortable as is the seating and atmosphere.   I ordered #25, the spicy Thai noodle with chicken, and the mushroom veggie spring rolls. The spring rolls arrived first, and were delicious. Tasty, straight from the deep fryer, and a flavorful blend of mushrooms, carrots, cabbage, glass noodles and other vegetables. I'm a carnivore but I like veggie spring rolls more. They were served with sweet chili sauce which was made in house according to the waitress and was better than the store bough sauce which I still think is good. There's four per order, so that's a bonus for sharing if you're in a party of two or more.   The spicy Thai noodle was next and was also pretty good. Nice flavor without being overly sweet, and large amounts of tender chicken with a generous helping of thick rice stick noodles and veggies. The presentation was a bit lacking, it looked like it lacked color which tells me the sauce was very water based. That's good for not overpowering the senses, but not as good as a good house made sauce or tamarind. The noodles were broken up and the vegetables cut into large chunks, I prefer smaller pieces. Still, a tasty dish.   The service was decent. Server was a little slow on bringing water, but she was polite and brought the food out to the table as soon as it was ready.   Neal total came to approx $17, and I tipped $4. Overall pretty good, but I wouldn't go across town to get it."}
{"text":"Ordered Royal Pad Thai at extra hot level... No tears, no dizziness, no chemical burns, only a mild sweat. Delicious but lacking the Muay Thai style kick of every other Thai restaurant I've been to... which all happen to have been in Texas. (It might be a American-Canadian regional adjustment.) So, I wonder how hot Thais actually eat their food...."}
{"text":"They claim to be the first Thai restaurant in Canada...I'm not so sure, but that's meant they've had plenty of time to either stick to their guns and be authentic or sell out.  The dishes vary from incredibly tasty to some real bombs.  The FOOD:  They have a nice traditional Thai menu with some definite hits and misses. HITS:  Basil duck.  This naturally somewhat spicy dish combines fragrant and flavorful basil with well-cooked skin-on duck.  The som tam (green papaya salad) is also well-executed with pleasant heat upon request.    MISSES:  Royal Pad Thai: this dish is laughingly labeled as authentic.  Well, the food court in the Eaton Centre does a much more authentic version.  Gooey, overly sweet, no sour flavor or nuance at all...one of the worst ones I've had.  Shockingly disappointing at $13.  The Thai spicy noodle was also a total miss, served in some sort of soupy mess.    The SERVICE is decent and friendly...especially when I drop a few words of Thai I've picked up in my travels.  TAKEOUT was disastrously slow...over an hour and a half to receive our order which was half an hour beyond the already long hour window.  The free spring rolls are two tiny greasy friend ones.    OVERALL, this is better than many of the Thai places in the city, but the quality and authenticity of their food is all over the map.   2 1/2 stars, rounded up."}
{"text":"Young Thailand may have been the first Thai restaurant in the city, but the best, it certainly is not.  Don't get me wrong, it's OK.  If you're satisfied with mediocre food, it'll get the job done.  I ordered the Pad Thai, green curry chicken and mango with sticky rice for pick up.  The only reason why I ordered from here on a Sunday night is because Sukho Thai on Parliament is closed on Sundays and their Wellington location wasn't picking up the phone.    The Pad Thai was too sweet (*ahem* ketchup) and the veggies were over cooked.  The noodles stuck to together so much that I wondered just how long they'd been sitting in the take out container.  The curry was very oily and didn't have the punch I had been hoping for.    The mango and sticky rice was ok, but the mango was definitely not ripe, which it should be for this dish.  Young Thailand, though I'm sure they're trying their best, did not satisfy my Thai craving and to be honest, I'm not really sure if I'll even sure if I'll finish the leftovers."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and ordered mango salad it was good, royal pad thai and spicy beef unfortunately we have to send back the spicy beef because it taste spoiled.   The staff are very friendly. I will definitely come back for mango and pineapple smoothies."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time weirdly since I've lived in the neighbourhood my whole life and I can say that I'm more than satisfied. The foods amazing and the price is just as good. I was seriously surprised. Really good service and just a generally good experience over all. Totally recommend to those who appreciate good Thai food on a good price!"}
{"text":"Pretty abysmal Thai food. Ordered delivery as I had hear good things from a friend but was super disappointed. Tom ka soup tastes like only coconut milk and lime with some chunks of dry chicken and mushrooms - no other veg no spices :( mango salad lacked spice or lime or salt, pretty bland and unauthentic. Curry was ok but not amazing enough to make up for all the other bad dishes"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad see yew, which was my favourite dish at Khao San Road, but is actually quite bad at Young Thailand. It tasted like when you're making a stir fry and you forget about it, and you burn it because all the liquid evaporated, and you don't want to throw it out (even though you should), so you're like \"it's still good, I'll eat it.\" It smelled and tasted burnt. It was pretty awful. The flavours were bland and boring, except for the burnt flavour, that one was pronounced. The tofu in the dish looked like something that had been cooked multiple times. Very gross. The veggies were obviously frozen cut up stir fry veggies. This was one of the worst Thai dishes I've ever had.  The appetizer soup was pretty decent. It had silken tofu (or something like that) in it, and was pretty good in flavour. Nothing amazing but it was nice. Unfortunately it had a mass of somewhat solid jelly in it. Not sure what it was, but I'm guessing it was a type of starch that didn't get incorporated that well. The spring roll was what you would expect from a frozen veggie spring roll that came in a box that said No Name on it. The appetizer salad was a pinch of iceberg lettuce with sesame oil and some sugary syrup on it. Very strange and extremely cheap-looking.  The service was ok. I found it funny that they never put the plate in front of me, always beside me as if there were an invisible person beside me. Not the hugest deal, I work out so I can lift a plate a couple of times, but I thought that was weird. They did do a good job at keeping water glasses full, though, so I'll give them that.  The only redeeming factor re: the food was that it was cheap. They have a $10 lunch special that comes with a soup and spring roll, so you get a decent amount of food for that price, that is, if you can manage to ingest it.  Everyone else liked the curries they ordered so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The server said it was better than their Pad Thai so I can't imagine what that would've tasted like. The place was pretty busy for lunch so maybe they just made my dish wrong, but it was pretty disappointing, considering people think it's better than Thai Elephant (though I would disagree)."}
{"text":"We take-out Young Thailand (King Location) at least once a week. It's our go-to take-out restaurant for fast, tasty, well-priced Thai food.   Typically we order the Royal Pad Thai -- don't bother with the regular. If you're going to spend $10 on pad thai, you might as well spring the extra $2 for the royal version which is worlds better. The cold rolls are a great appetizer. If you like duck, try the Curry Duck dish with rice (mmmm, drooling just thinking of it).   Lastly, Young Thai is really good with regulating the heat of their dishes. I love Thai, but hate spicy food... so they do a great job when I request extra mild dishes."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai Place I have ever been. The curry is so good and I got it with coconut rice it was amazing!!!!! BEST THAI PLACE EVER!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Felt kind of rushed because we came here at 9pm and it was like they were trying to get us out!! I asked for no peanuts on my pad Thai and I got nuts on my pad Thai.   I could be someone who is severely allergic to peanuts and it would have been an horrible experience."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out as I just moved into the neighbourhood and they boast about being the first Thai restaurant in Toronto.  The decor was nice and clean, however it feels a bit stuck in the 80's. I was surprised that there was only one other table that was occupied and two people ordering take out there when I was there -- this was 7:30 on a Saturday night. To be fair it was a Canada Day long weekend, but it just felt really odd and I was expecting just a few more people there.  The service was excellent. The waitor was friendly and very courteous and our water glasses were constantly filled throughout our meal. The wait for our food was rather slow considering we were the only ones in the restaurant (the other table was finishing their meals when we arrived).  The food was a major let down, which is maybe why the restaurant was empty.  We had the Basil Duck which was drowning in a very salty sauce and the duck meat was rubbery and a bit over cooked. This was probably because the duck has been twice cooked (roasted and then stir fried).  The Mixed Seafood Green Curry came in a nicely flavoured sauce, however it could use more heat and it was very watery. The two pieces of mussels were cooked from frozen not fresh and I was horrified to see two sticks of imitation crab which fell apart in the bottom of the bowl as it was overcooked to death. Why would anyone put imitation crab in curry? That was something I would cook for myself when I was in university! There was no baby eggplant that was promised in the menu, which I was very disappointed as I love eggplant especially with curry.  The Grilled Whole Thai Snapper was the worst dish of the night. According to the menu it was supposed to be deboned and grilled with banana leaves which sounded really good, as I like the traditional fried whole snapper and thought that having it grilled it would be a nice alternative.  What came was a snapper that was full of bones, big and small, but what was worse was the snapper was not properly scaled and cleaned which makes for eating the fish rather difficult and ungraceful having to pull out bones and the many scales out of your mouth and on to the plate. I didn't see any banana leaf, but instead was a few large leaves of lettuce. The sauce was bit unusual tasting, as I think the lime leaves and lemongrass was a little overused.  All three dishes had the overuse of red and green peppers as the veggie ingredients, which was really disappointing and lacking in effort. I would like to see more substantial veggies used.    The total tab for dinner was reasonable, however I think for the same price I could have a much better Thai meal at Coco Rice just down the street."}
{"text":"Young Thailand is one of those restaurants that keeps popping up all over the city. It is the oldest Thai restaurant in Toronto and has moved through various locations across the city. A couple of years ago we enjoyed it when it opened on College Street near Spadina and were saddened when it left. We didn't know where it went and were delighted to find it on Parliament Street. As soon as we sat down we realized it was the same restaurant that had been on College Street that we had come to love. Before that they had been located off of Queen Street on John Street.   The new location on Parliament is much larger and has given them a lovely space to work with. They have carried over the same colour scheme using much of the original design elements making it familiar for those who knew the restaurant in its previous locations. I have never had a bad meal at any of their locations and the food lived up to their reputation. My favourite has always been the pumpkin soup which is a delicious blend of pumpkin, coconut milk and curry. It is one of those places where everyone will end up trying every dish. Be prepared to share and enjoy."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place in the city for Thai. Not only is food fresh, delicious and plentiful but the service is amazing. We had a very drunk man come into the restaurant while we were there and our waitress handled him with impeccable patience..even offering him some food and water.  The King Pad Thai dish is by far a winner, but the Calamari is also amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the crispy red snapper with tamarind sauce, the fish is amazingly crispy but they could do better with the quality of the tamarind sauce on the fried snapper.  It was bland, lacking the tamarind taste and spices.  It just tasted like salty corn starch.    Also they should put do something about the smell of stale algae emanating throughout the place, presumably from the water features they have inside."}
