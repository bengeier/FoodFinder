{"text":"After being stood up by my studio photographer for the LAST time (a very angry yelp review is brewing in my head as I type this) I was getting dehydrated and gouchy as I haven't had a bite to eat all day. 

We decided to go to La Olmeca for lunch. This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s. Wood paneled walls, grimy pastel booths and chipped wooden tables can be looked over when the food is good... but the food just wasn't.

I had had the taco salad and was very disappointed. It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special. She wasn't complaining, but I would be if I saw the brown underbelly of her overcooked omlet. Her potatos were straight from a bag. BUT the salsa was good. 

Overall... skip this place. Even if you're in the area... a couple blocks south and you'll be at Poncho's... trust me you'll be waaay better off! I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"two words: mole poblano. theirs is a revelation. my colleagues are mexican food geeks and even they agree that olmeca takes the cake for mole in phoenix. the only downside is the location...kinda out of the way...but worth the trip."}
{"text":"My experience at Olmeca has been positive every time I've gone. I actually get really amazing customer service every time I eat here. The dishes that I have tried have a been delicious. I believe the price for the quality of food is pretty fair. This restaurant is old school. The inside has not been remodeled in years and all furniture is out of date. Still I love eating here, especially breakfast! I would recommend the mole enchiladas or huevos rancheros because they are bomb.com tell your mom!"}
{"text":"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME place is filthy dirty,people who run it are folding there  personal laundry on the dining room tables $,7.08 for rolled tacos and a drink  took one taste and left maybe thats why they have a sign   NO REFUNDS when your not satisfied anywhere else with your meal  cant you get your money back?not here all of a sudden me speke no english, later la olmeca"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a several times in the last couple weeks. Tried the shrimp el diablo and it was really good and so was the fillette empanizado.   They serve a small bowl of packaged type chips with salsa at the begining of the meal. The home made salsa they serve with the chips is really excellent, I asked and they let me buy some to go. This place has been here forever and continues to serve good food for a good price."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE IF TRYING TO USE COUPONS HERE!  They refuse to honor coupon from entertainment.com.  Coupon reads:  
\"Enjoy one complimentary MENU ITEM when a second MENU ITEM of equal or greater value is purchased or when dining alone  -  one MENU ITEM at 50% off the regular price  -  Up to $6 Maximum Discount.\"

They insist that you must buy 1 meal and the 2nd meal is 50% off (not free).  They will not honor the dining alone option which is 50% off one item.  I believe they are baiting and switching with anyone trying to use this entertainment.com coupon.  Very snotty, indignant attitude also.  Will never give them my business, as there are too many small mom and pop Mexican food operations that have great food and treat you very well."}
{"text":"Same kind of food one gets at Rancho market. I would skip it and go to another place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!! The owner are always so kind to me. I go in for their menudo and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant for REAL authentic Mexican food on the South side of Phoenix. Busy on a Saturday but the wait was worth it. Again another good place to bring our baby. 

The prices were cheap for quality. We got two entrees, an appetizer and two drinks for $20. I got a chicken taco and asada taco dinner combo. The asada taco was amazing! Beautifully seasoned and not over cooked. The refried beans were the second best thing I ate on my plate. OMG. Best beans ever! The chicken taco could have been a little more seasoned for my taste and the nachos we had for appetizer I will probably pass on next time. They reminded me of the nachos you can get at a baseball game. 

Overall, I'll definitely be back! Yum!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the complex, it looks a little shady from the outside, to be honest it is not that nice inside either. However more often than not the hole in the wall joints turn in to hidden gems. This isn't exactly a gem, but it is cheap and good (say Los Favritos or La Salsa kind of  good).

The tacos are great and so are the tortas, the meat gets simmered for hours and the veggies are always cold and crisp. Ask for the extra hot salsa, it is smoky and spicy and wonderfully flavorful, I think it is chipotles en adobo but I can't confirm this. 

If you happen to find yourself on the southside and are in the mood for fast, cheap mexican this is the spot to hit."}
{"text":"Ok ,,,, I haven't been to this restaurant in about three years I went back thinking it was going to be the same O same O(which I loved) it turned out to be a very big disappointment;( won't be back plus they were rude"}
{"text":"I recommend eating there on the weekends, preferably the menudo if and when it's fresh and there cocido, other than that if you want the runs, as what my family had gotten then I recommend eating there weekday daily specials. No offense"}
{"text":"This place should be called Taco's Yum.  At least that was my thought after having some of their yummy yummy tacos.  I've had just about every kind now and while I can't say for sure that I have a favorite the carnitas and the fish are totally on top of the list. Mmmm.  Folks I've gone with have done plate food and burritos and both really liked what they've gotten.   Me, I stick to the tacos.  Yummy every single time.  Fresh veggies and herbs.  What's should be cold is cold and what should be warm is warm.  Juicy meat, but not so much so that it soaks totally through the corn tortillas.  I could go on, but really, I think the pictures of the tacos speak for themselves.  

And did I mention it's cheap?  Sooooo cheap that I almost felt bad using my 2 for 1 coupon the first time I went.  Of course, I did anyhow.  And let me tell you that a free taco tastes just as good."}
