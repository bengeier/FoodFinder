{"text":"A group dinner brought me to Zocalo and I was worried about the poor reviews and lack of vegan dishes on the website's menu. However, our server was very friendly and was informed about what was cooked in chicken stock. All but one of the beans and their rice were not vegetarian. There was a vegan tamale dish on the printed menu as long as it is ordered with no rice and the black beans, which is what I ordered.  The presentation of the food was excellent, but I found the tamales to be overly sweet for my taste. The guacamole is made to order right at your table and everyone loved it.  We were seated in the basement and the ambient noise level was super high - it was hard to hear anyone who wasn't sitting next to me making conversation difficult.  I was very happy with the service and found the food to be above average. I would gladly go back if the restaurant expanded its vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Dish: Tacos Pescados     The corn tortillas were old, and they cracked.  The mahi-mahi was overcooked.  The chipotle glaze was unnecessary.   Price: Mid-teens     They charged us dinner prices for a 1 pm lunch.  Service: Slow     It was about an hour for the food to be delivered.  The staff was polite though.  Verdict: Not a good place for dining     I won't eat there again, but I may go for drinks after work if I'm feeling tequila.  At least the kitchen wouldn't be able to mess that up."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to get when I arrived. Bartender mentioned the words chorizo, bacon, and burger and my search was over. One of my favorite burgers of all time now. You get chips and salsa but the salsa wasn't your average red fresh out of the can salsa. Legit, close to authentic greenish salsa, I almost finished the chips myself. Different but very delicious fries. I grew up on Mexican beer so that wasn't even an issue. Friendly staff. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tried it again, really, this is what visitors to our town experience on 4th street, something needs to put in its place before the RNC. Poor service and the food is not quality, drinks are very expensive for what you get.  Awesome location.This is  the last visit and last review. I am in a position to refer restaurants to out of town visitors several times a week  and thought I would give it a fair shot again, no more done very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a reservation at Zocalo for over 2 months and they called us 1 hour before the reservation time to say they would no longer be accepting our reservation. Poor management. Not impressed by this place. Service is not good.  Food is OK. Find a different place, there are hundreds of tequileria's, find a different one."}
{"text":"I found myself walking past Zocalo on E 4th a number of times during lunch and at night and the majority of the time especially during lunch this place is packed. So I finally decided to go in and give it try, why not how bad can it be or good. So I started with a drink with tostadas and salsa, the waitress was very nice and on her \"A\" game. As I dipped in to the salsa and tasted it I found myself tasting a very bland, flat tasting, paste of marinara sauce. Yup marinara sauce not salsa marinara sauce. Very poor poor poor tasting salsa.  Next I ordered an enchilada plate with cheese inside them, refried pinto beans, and Mexican rice. As I took a bite of the red enchilada I have to say it was the worse enchilada I have ever tasted, the enchilada tasted like lasagna, the beans tasted straight out of the can, and the rice tasted like Uncle Bens instant rice with tomato sauce in it.  I have to say this is very subpar Mexican food and that's being nice, I now it's Cleveland and the restaurant has to cater to a different customer but boy was this poor tasting food. I make 100 times better Mexican food at my home kitchen then this place does. If this place needs some help when it comes to making salsa I can give them ideas, if they need some help in making better enchiladas I can help, and if you need help in finding authentic ingredients I can help. I know what real good quality Mexican food is and this isn't it.  Oh and by the way bar tenders Silver tequila is not good tequila reposado and añejo are. Know you're tequilas and aging process."}
{"text":"Not sure what I like more about this place. The birds flying around or the Cinqo de Mayo clock on the wall. When I walked in said 273 days 10 hours 34 minutes 22 seconds. When I left it said 273 days 9 hours 30 minutes 11 seconds. Its like it knew I was going to be in there for a little over an hour. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"After my last review here on yelp I was contacted by the business owner. They were apologetic for the poor experience. Though I was not offered any incentive to try again, I decided to give it a second shot.   Well. The meal was ok. The tamales were far from traditional. Instead of traditional tamale masa it was almost a corn bake, not what I expected at all though it was tasty.   The server was friendly but as some folks here mention, the server has no faith in the kitchen. The cooks were described as \"grumpy\". When we asked about a taco that was on the Tuesday specials (we went back on a Monday) we found out it wasn't available. When we asked if something like that could be made we were told the cooks don't like to make anything not on the menu. Lastly the tacos that were ordered were missing salsa, when we inquired we were told that sometimes the cooks don't remember the menu.   This place needs to seriously get their kitchen in order. I would strongly advise passing it up."}
{"text":"Waited a very long time for my food. I didn't get what I ordered. Food was unbelievably spicy. (No warning about it either). Waitresses were polite but seemed distracted. The empanadas de carne were very good but my main meal (zocalo filet) wasn't satisfying & it was one of the most pricey on the menu. It tasted like olives & too spicy. The rice that came with it was equally spicy so I couldn't really even it out. I think this place has potential & I hope they can adjust their food & for the love of God tone down the spicy factor!!!"}
{"text":"Not good! Went in to this restaurant on a double date with our best friends...on my birthday. Came out feeling like I aged 5 years. While I can't speak to most of the menu I can highly recommend NOT getting the Veggie Burrito bowl, and the chicken salad taco (we unfortunately we're there on Taco Tuesday) and the carnitas taco...The 1 fish bowl sized margarita we ordered (that was spilled in transit) was clumsy and unappealing.  I give it one star for location which is its only saving attribute. Michael Symon's restaurant LOLA is right across the street...we should've gone there."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Ever.  I guess that's what I get for not reading the reviews.  Walking down 4th Street, looking for a dinner destination, I stumbled upon Zocalo.  Everything on the menu looked quite tasty, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I liked the atmosphere, too.  Free chips and salsa were a plus (the chips were decent, the salsa was subpar).  But it was all downhill from there.  I ordered a chicken enchilada and a carnitas taco.  The enchilada might've been OK if it wasn't for the dry, flavorless chicken (which, by the way, the waitress said was \"the best\").  I tried to salvage it by dowsing it with sour cream and guacamole, but it was still awful.  The taco, on the other hand, was nearly inedible.  The tortilla looked and tasted as if it'd been soaked in oil.  The carnitas were bone dry... I've never had such awful meat in my life!  I tried a few bites, and I guess that was a few bites too many, as my stomach is scolding me now."}
{"text":"The hubby and I ended up here on date night. Great decision. We loved the location, atmosphere and the service was great.  I had the fish tacos, which were amazing and he had a chicken quesadilla. We also loved their queso dip. We definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"I took my friends here from out of town, and boy am I ever embarrassed. We had a terrible and rude waiter who never offered to bring us water. He laughed when checking our IDs I'm assuming because we look young (despite all being 24)He told us the margarita pitcher would serve 5, yet it only served 3. He brought us margaritas on the rocks when we asked for frozen and when we told him, he told me \"the frozen margaritas are terrible, they're so watered down, you don't  want them, but I can make it for you\" Wow awesome sell. So we stuck to our on the rocks.  5 minutes later, they were completely melted and nothing but water. When we brought it to his attention he told us \"that's what happens when you let ice sit\" That was it for us.  We called a manager over (after talking to another table having a problem with this server) and told her what he had said. Rather than being apologetic she questioned us, saying \"really, he's one of our best servers?\" She offered to make us another pitched, which I refused due to the lack of any taste in our first one, however it was free so we took it. It was much better than the first.  The point is, this is a Mexican restaurant, their margaritas should be a staple. It is the worst margarita I've ever had, it was light green water. Their service is terrible.  I will never ever go back to this place and recommend no one go..."}
{"text":"I went to Zocala because I had a Groupon.  I wouldn't eat there again - for free.  Stood at the hostess podium for about 3 minutes before she surfaced from downstairs surprised to find a line of people waiting to be seated.  Ordered blackberry and lime margaritas because it sounded wonderfully refreshing.  No hint of either taste and clearly not more than a drop of tequila.  I'm not sure what our drinks were made of.   I don't even want to describe the sorry tasteless, seemingly frozen foods we ordered and I don't want to talk about the slow with an attitude service( - is bad service still called service?)  I left there very confused asking my husband \"If you have a great location why wouldn't you as an owner/manager be in there tasting, using fresh quality ingredients and making sure everything was as near perfect as could be?\"  And now that I'm reading more poor reviews than good on many sites for this place - I'm asking myself don't the owner/managers/ employees read these reviews and take heed??  That many of us can't be wrong."}
{"text":"Omg.  Service is horrible.   Took a long time for them to even approach us to see what we want.  Then ordered appetizers and it never came.   She claimed I thought it was with your food.    They don't give a crap about service.   Won't come here again."}
{"text":"How is it possible for Mexican food to have zero flavor? I didn't think it was until I went to Zocalo.  No cumin, no \"middle\" notes, just bland red sauce and tons of \"smoke\"/hickory. If you're lucky you'll get a little bitter cilantro flavor, some high notes of hot pepper, or a little sweetness from the corn chips. No. Flavor.   This is an example of how a place with terrible food will remain open simply because it is in a hot \"district\" where people go because they think the area is perceived to be safe and fun. (Yet meanwhile loads of better Mom and Pop places off the beaten path struggle because it doesn't cater to the masses...)  Do you find yourself in love with the tableside guacomole? Here's a tip: Go to your grocery store and buy a bowl, two avocadoes, a tomato, an onion, a chile, some cilantro, a lime, and some salt. Use a knife to cut them, a fork to mix them, and invite your friends over to watch it. Some Coronas may help. I guarantee you instant popularity and a coolness factor of 10. You don't need to go here to have it.  The service here is terrible. When I asked the waiter if my colleague could have some more iced tea, he snapped back that he could see her glass was empty, and that he had been serving for over 10 years and that I shouldn't tell him how to do his job. Meanwhile he left our dirty appetizer plates sit in front of us for over 30 minutes.   I have been here four times (dragged by coworkers and friends wanting a \"fun\" outing) and have hated it every single time.  Don't waste your time or money, Cleveland."}
{"text":"So I went in with pretty mediocre expectations and I still was let down. Service was rather poor: food took forever and we didn't get water or any drinks until 15 mins after sitting down. They forgot my friend's rice and my quesadillas were pretty bland. I will say it is a cool location so that's why it's 2 stars not 1."}
{"text":"We made reservations, it took almost a half hour to get our drinks, and much longer to get our food. The margaritas were decent,and once we got our food, it was worth the wait. I would recommend this place on a less busy night."}
{"text":"This is a very nice and enticing restaurant with strong potential to be a big hit.  Unfortunately the food and drinks are very mediocre, but what is worse is the quality of service.  It is slow, but at least they make up for it by being rude and indifferent....  During our last attempt to give them another chance the hostess was unbelievably rude, almost as if she was doing us a favor by seating us when the restaurant was 2/3 empty! No thanks!  There are much better places to eat when coming to downtown Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Ever eat at those Mexican places in the airport?  You kind of feel like \"eh, well it's food...  and I guess it's Mexican...  so okay. And we're in an airport, so it shouldn't be super cheap either\"  That's the feeling you get when you go here...  except it's not in an airport.  Overall it fills you up and the margaritas are okay, but you sort of feel like you're eating there just because you want Mexican and are hungry, not because the place is overly scrumptuous."}
{"text":"Definitely not a good choice to dine.  I had the carnitas and the meat tasted like it was boiled without seasoning. The rice tasted like it was the boil in the bag type rice or maybe it was microwaved."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and drinks are pretty good. Really enjoyed my dinner. Great staff as well. Everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Oh man, I was not impressed with anything during my experience at Zocalo.  I went with a few girls after one said that she liked it.  I almost never say no to Mexican food, so this night was no exception.   After waiting a few minutes for a table we were seated at booth (which I would normally love), but these booths are just weird.  The table is too high or the benches are too low, either way they're awkward (has anyone else noticed this??).  Anyway, our server came over pretty promptly and we ordered some drinks.  I had the Margarita Classico, which comprised mostly of sour mix and salt.  I forgot to order no salt, so maybe that was my bad.  As an appetizer for the table we ordered the guacamole trio, which was good (but not on par with the creative guacs from Momocho).  The chips, however homemade, were so greasy that it was almost hard to continue eating them.  For my entree I had the Grande Burrito, with black bean/vegetable filling.  It was just ok.  I opted for a side salad instead of beans and rice and it was probably the best part of my meal.    We decided to order the churros with a trio of sauces for desert, because, I mean, churros are always delicious!  Wow, was I wrong.  The churros didn't seem to have been fried, nor was there any cinnamon or sugar to speak of on them.  Also they were filled (1/2 with cream cheese and 1/2 with some kind of fruit-cherry, maybe), but even that didn't save them.  Perhaps the most offensive part of the desert was the trio of sauces.  Each one was runnier than the next, not appetizing and not conducive to dipping.  Bleh.  No thanks, Zocalo."}
{"text":"Went to Zocalo over Labor Day weekend while checking out the air show before the Tribe game and I was not impressed at all.  The hostess seemed lost and almost put out that she had to seat us (family of 4). The waitress was very nice but everything took so long.  My wife had the Mojito which was all soda and I had a very weak, watered-down blood orange margarita.  The steak fajitas were tough and hard to cut, not a good cut of meat.  Empanadas did not have much filling.   Beans were good but that was about it.  My bill was close to $75 and wasn't worth half of that.  The location is awesome on E 4th and I'm sure restaurateurs will be lining up to jump in this spot once they close the doors if the quality of the food and drinks continue at this pace.  2 stars because the waitress was nice and the beans were good.  My suggestion: there are so many great places around this area - it's worth checking out a different spot."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We were seated right away. We were a little sticker shocked on the price of a pitcher of margaritas ($30) but they were in a good size pitcher, delicious and smooth. The food menu is inexpensive compared to the drinks and everything we had was good. LISTEN TO OUR WAITRESS: the shark is bland and not worth the adventure!"}
{"text":"Hectic, uncomfortable environment with mediocre and pricey food for what they give ya. The staff was super nice, but fairly inattentive given the constant chaos distracting them away from our party.  I think the layout of this place is too cramped, cave-like, and difficult to maneuver through, making it a pretty stressful place for patron and staff alike!  Unfortunately, I had to send my food back it was so terrible. I only do that in rare cases of disgustingness beyond edibility. So, well, don't get the tortilla soup. I don't want to get into the details... Just trust that it's a nasty rendition of the dish.   My friends got tacos which turned out to be tasty, but word to the wise, one person had large slices of jalapeño lazily slapped in between his tortillas, which lead him to experience immense pain. Luckily, we are spicy masochists who are into that kind of thing, but a more sensitive customer would have been chagrined by the surprise.  Decent guacamole, but absolutely not worth $10. It wasn't made at the table as advertised - it was clearly scooped out of a pre-made bin, and had that wet, store bought quality to it. Not cool.   To wrap it up, there's a chipotle down the street that you can hit up instead."}
{"text":"I went here last week on Taco Night and loved the authentic atmosphere-- you have to see what they do with tequila bottles! It was a little pricier than I expected, but I guess that has to do with the location and the celebrity chef that owns the place.  I'm surprised that there's such a low average of stars on here. The food wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't terrible. I sampled several tacos and they were all pretty good, and obviously it's pretty difficult to mess up margaritas, so if I were you, I'd definitely go to Taco Night if you're planing a trip there! If anything, I'd say the service was rather slow and seemed clueless. When I asked for a recommendation, they just laughed awkwardly and said that \"it's all good.\""}
{"text":"With news that this place has changed its menu \"featuring culinary creations by celebrity chef Aaron Sanchez\", I was willing to give this place a shot. I find myself to be simple and not demanding. All I request is a decent vegetarian meal. What I received from Zocalo was lard filled tortillas that I found out were filled with lard AFTER I consumed them. I feel sick just thinking about it. The server we had tonight was super sweet and felt really bad about the mix up.  I blame the kitchen and management!  There were a couple kitchen mix ups including my \"vegetarian\" fajitas coming to the table as chicken fajitas by mistake. Come on Zocalo....do you want to continue to get poor reviews?  Or would you like to get your act together?? You have an awfully large space to fill with patrons everyday.   I would prefer not return here for a meal. Drinks and appetizers may be OK.   Disclaimer: The three carnivores I dined with all enjoyed their meals and beverages. They all agreed my meal should have been taken off the bill (which it was not)."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Great relaxed and festive atmosphere in an even better location downtown. - If you're hungry, I recommend the tacos as they're inexpensive and pretty good overall. - Order a margarita on the rocks during happy hour: great tastes for a great deal. This place does have good tequila! - Overall, I have always been pleased with Zocalo's customer service. - In my most recent experience I, unfortunately, didn't enjoy my main entree, so I politely ordered a couple of inexpensive tacos. Though I didn't request to have the entree removed from my bill, the waitress offered anyway. This was a great gesture, and let me know that the waitress and managers are sensitive to the customer experience.  Areas for Improvement:  - Overall, the sentiment among yelp-ers on this page is true: the food is just OK. If you're going out for dinner on East 4th Street, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been in the restaurant industry my entire life so writing a review is something I dont do lightly. A few of us went in yesterday for Cinco and despite an awkward seating situation where we had to get up from the table to then be seated by the hostess at the same exact table, service was fine and our server was super nice and attentive.   The purpose of this review is to point out that a Negra Modelo on draft should not EVER be $8.00. EVER. I'm fully aware that its east 4th, and your rent is more expensive, but how can a draft beer bee the same price as a mojito or magarita? It just doesn't make sense. I'm aware that the management company has other restaurants so they know how pricing works, but Ive never seen pricing THAT ridiculous."}
{"text":"Well this place is hit or miss. 3rd time here and not many positive things to say. Waitstaff is a bunch of cranky-bums who take zero pride in their appearance (at least 5 messy buns!). Table side side guac is average at best. All that and pricey. Good key west margheritas. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place, but today, for some reason, the service was atrocious! Waited waaaay too long to order and for drink refills. We believe milk took so long as they had to birth, feed, and grow the cow, then milk and pasteurize it. Terrible service"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, same old Tex Mex stuff with less flavor.  Service was poor.  About the only good thing was a very nice selection of Tequila.  Don't ever expect to be back"}
{"text":"I went there a few days ago since it looked good when I was walking around the area.  It was Tuesday so the taco menu was an option in addition to the regular one.  Got the combo and chose a beef tamale and a chicken mole enchilada, with a beef house taco on the side. Chips were good but a bit oily, they came out hot and seemed to be freshly fried.  The default salsa was great but a bit mild, I asked for the hot one and got one that had a nice heat but seemed to be mainly tomatoes and hot peppers, it lacked the complexity and flavor of the mild one. The combo plate was larger than I expected, the enchilada was good but nothing spectacular, but the tamale was a nice surprise.  It was made by steaming a sweetened corn mixture in a corn husk, splitting it open, and topping it with a lot more beef than I've ever seen before in a tamale.  Overall it was very good. The house taco was also good, it was the same beef from the tamale combined with a cilantro lime slaw in a soft corn tortilla.  It had more filling than the tortilla could hold, and it was falling apart trying to hold it all.  Overall not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"After ordering and eating an appetizer, the Subway commercial on the bar tv looked really tasty. Yuk. Don't let your friends eat here!"}
{"text":"This place sucks, the waitress was kind of pushy, asked if our food was good after we finished. (Would have been nice to ask earlier since we needed hot sauce). I ordered a combination burrito and my fiance wanted a burrito with black beans and rice , but rice had animal by product in it and ended up getting a veggie bowl with only a couple veggies and some guacamole that sucked , also it had tortilla strips, so it was a guacamole, black bean and tortilla bowl with light veggies . And for my burrito lots of chicken with large chunks of raw onion and an unpeeled tomato chunks and I mean huge chunks that were really chewy.  The only great thing was the chips and dip . Do not go here -waste of money. Go to taco bell spent 4 dollars on a burrito that will be larger and taste a a lot better or just jump off a fucking cliff because killing yourself would be better to."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Sat us under the stairs next to kitchen in the basement. Staff was bothered we were there and said it would be a wait for a table. There were at least twenty tables. Salsa was good. Rest of food was was so so. No one finished their food. I give it one star for the salsa."}
{"text":"Decent margaritas and food. I come here often. The happy hour quality differs. This place was better before. I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"I went to Zocalo on a busy Saturday expecting to enjoy a nice margarita, chips, salsa and a fun appetizer on the patio. I paid for the scenery, not the quality of the food.  Every thing I ordered was underwhelming. The Classic margarita was overpriced and watered-down. The salsa was extremely bland. It lacked the Mexican flavors of cilantro, lime and salt almost as if they opened a can of store-bought salsa and served it to me. I decided to try the crab cakes. Huge mistake! The crab cakes contained very little crab, they were hard on the outside and mushy on the inside. The applesauce on top was also gross. I will never come to this restaurant again. If you want better Mexican food, you're better off heading to Chipotle down the street or stopping at your local grocery store to make your own Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Over priced mediocre food. The chips and salsa was the only thing that had flavor. We did have reservations but didn't seem like we needed them. The waitress was spacey, we would see her then she would disappear.  There are much better places to eat, skip this place!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend picked Zocalo's and we had high hopes. It was busy at dinner time on a Tuesday. Clevelanders could not be spending their hard earned cash at a bad Mexican place, could they? But, Cleveland, you really let us down.   The meal started with good salsa and chips and went downhill from there.  The food was basically bland.  My girlfriend got a prickly pear margarita which tasted neither like a prickly pear nor like tequila. We factually ordered a shot of Cuervo 1800 and poured it into the margarita in order to make it actually taste like a margarita.    I had a goat cheese quesadilla. Yes, it taste like goat cheese-- but a very weak, bland goat cheese.  And my plate was smudged with food streaks around the edge of my dish as if the plate were dirty before food was put on it.  My girlfriend had a combo fajita platter of shrimp and chicken. She complained it was very bland as well.  I had one of her shrimp to nibble on and, although it has the basic texture of shrimp, it real tasted like nothing, like air.    The tab was $46 for two dinners which included 1 margarita, 1 shot of Cuervo 1800, and a Corona Light. The best thing I had was my Corona Light. My girlfriend could make better-- and cheaper-- Mexican food in her kitchen. I'm still not sure why this place was even as busy as it was."}
{"text":"Pretty nice for a Friday happy hour.  Great prices and nice location and view from the patio."}
{"text":"Glop is the best way to describe my food experience at zocalo.  Location and outside seating is excellent but quality and taste of food less than ideal.  My family of 4 all had different dishes and the only edible items we agreed on were the salsa and the black beans.  Nothing else.  Not one of our dishes would we recommend.  To make matters worse, our waiter was indifferent.  Shall we say not interested in our experience at all.  That will be my last time at this restaurant. Very disappointing in a hot trendy area of 4th street."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews here - my experience at Zocalo was wonderful! I stopped here on a road trip back in June and we got in to Cleveland very late and very hungry. Zocalo was close to our hotel and they were open, so we went. Our server (who I believe was named Fran, but I don't remember for sure) was incredibly friendly and made us feel right at home. Zocalo does not have a very vegetarian-friendly menu (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) but our server helped the vegetarians in our group find something to eat - not just whatever they could come up with in the kitchen, but something we actually liked! She even answered our questions about Cleveland and was overall a fantastic server. As a Californian (with Mexican restaurants in the family, no less), I wasn't expecting much out of Mexican food in Ohio, but it was surprisingly very good and it was one of the best meals I had on our trip. I wish I lived in Cleveland so I could come back here. I definitely recommend giving Zocalo a chance despite the bad reviews!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid writing negative reviews, but after trying this place three different times over a two-year period, I must.  The food is bland. The only part with seasoning is the meat, which can vary from under-seasoned to way, way, over-seasoned.  After a few years in business, you'd think they'd figure-out how to get a happy medium.  Lunch - c'mon guys, $15.00 for three (small) tacos, approx. 1/2 cup of beans & 1/2 cup of rice?  I know this isn't one of the typical lots-o-food-for-little-money Mexican restaurants found in the suburbs, but your food has to be much better at this price point.  Service - the most consistent part of all three trips. Slow. Always. Have to flag-down another server to refill your drink, because your server doesn't seem to be around.  In short, I don't know how this place stays in business.  I wish something on the order of Momocho or MiPueblo was downtown instead."}
{"text":"Not great, but it was a fun time with friends before an Indians game. The happy hour specials were good ($5/drink) and the food was tasty. I probably would not have gone if we did not have a gift certificate. However, the chips and salsa were yummy!"}
{"text":"I liked the food here a lot. Its a little different from most Mexican restaurants I've eaten at, not in a bad way though. My girlfriend likes it here which is awesome because she doesn't like any other Mexican restaurant we've been to. But with Zocalo I can be reunited with this wonderful food. The prices here are less than the other places on East 4th."}
{"text":"Location is one of the VERY few things this place has going for it. First off, the male bartender that works Friday nights is pathetic...Rude, slow, and not well groomed. The hostess was nice, our waitress was decent, beer wasn't very cold, food was fair... and the prices are pretty high. I would only recommend this place out of sheer convenience if you are going to a baseball game or a concert."}
{"text":"Not good. I wanted to try this place because it's in a great location but I should have just listened to the bad reviews because they were true. Food was terrible. Chips were very greasy and quesadillas were gross! Margaritas were not good either."}
{"text":"Just ate there. Austin was a great server! Great value for TopFlight tequila sampler! Food was ok. Other staff unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"Everyone's expectations of this Gateway District restaurant may be too high.  I'm always pleased to have a short walk before or after a game or other event and get seated promptly.  Whether warming up after blustery lake effect conditions or sitting in open air patio in front of the place on a hot summer night, always a good time in my book. Tasty food and drinks are a bonus in such a great venue! Pic was taken Spring 2011 in alley of Gateway District in front of Zocalo.  What a great night, believe me!  I've had many more  before and after"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here for the first time a couple weeks ago. It was a Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they had happy hour specials. I tried a $5 margarita. It was good, not too strong. I also tried a beef taco and a chicken taco. The chicken taco was great, but I probably won't get the beef one again!"}
{"text":"Zocalo no es muy bueno. Arriving last night for our 5:30 reservation, made by phone three weeks earlier, we were told by the snippy hostess that they weren't taking reservations for the night. She proudly showed me the blocked-out reservations book to prove it. Well, I had made reservations and told her so again. She asked \"well, who did you talk to?\" and I told her it is not my job as the customer to make a note of who I talked to. It was Cavs playoffs night #5, but that fact hadn't been known three weeks earlier and nobody at this very poorly run establishment had bothered to call us to let us know not to come down. If we hadn't been meeting mobile phone-less friends, we would have left immediately. Not to mention we had already paid the bargain rate of $15 for a surly pizza-eating valet to park our car. The decor of the place is comic-book Mexican, bright colors and fake rusticity all around. The atmosphere is one of already-tattered and deeply unsanitary lack of caring on the management's part. The blank-eyed hostess reluctantly led us to a basement booth with a panoramic view of the chaotic dish room, conveniently located next to the ladies' room (no soap in the soap dispenser and water all over the floor on two visits that evening). We refused that booth and got one two seats away with the same features. The mirror at the inside end of the booth was spattered with some long-dried-on liquid that I couldn't take my eyes off all night. We were greeted immediately by a very lively, friendly server named Debra. She continued to be a doll the entire evening, the single highlight in a grueling culinary trek. Menus (plastic, Denny's style) were doled out. If you've ever eaten in any generic Mexican restaurant, I really don't need to go over the listings. All the usual banal offerings were there. We ordered a pitcher of \"Cosmoritas\", pink sour-mix lacking any discernible tequila. We also ordered the table side guacamole. It was fresh and chunky, quite delightful. The chips were sturdy and warm. After much discussion, we ordered a combination platter consisting of a shredded beef burrito (very small and with very little filling), a chicken tamale (dry and gummy; how did they achieve both of these failures in one teensy tamale?) and a carnitas soft taco (the meat was dry and stringy. Was that really pork shoulder?). This \"platter\" was accompanied by a tablespoon of listless cabbage slaw (obviously made the day before and without any discernible flavor)  a dab of refried beans straight out of the can (you could stand a spoon straight up in that stuff) and some mushy Spanish Rice like we used to be served in the school cafeteria, except that the school version was delicious. We had a nostalgic moment of talking about how much we all loved that day in school. And the pizza bagels, of course. There was also a three-compartment side dish of sour cream, pre-made guacamole and very bland salsa. If we had enjoyed any of the above items, we would have been sorely disappointed by the portion sizes, which were almost laughable skimpy. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I don't like big portions. Zocalo erred on the side of skimp; I don't know why. It didn't matter to us, though, since we disliked our meal so much that the two of us didn't even finish the shared platter, even after the act of desperation of ordering another pitcher of Cosmoritas. Still no tequila taste and no \"desired effect\"....We also tried the pumpkin flan and got through two bites of the heavy, numbingly sweet confection. On our way out, our wonderful server thanked us for being the nicest customers of the night \"with such a great attitude\". For a burst of zany fun, we took the elevator on the way upstairs and shared the ride with a reeking bus cart loaded with crusted old plates that someone had forgotten long ago to take to the dish room. Stick with the table side guacamole and chips, get some beer and then leave. Mamacita says."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. Wanna get drunk on half decent margaritas and sub-par chips and salsa go right ahead. Cleanliness of restaurant and staff is questionable Kinda wish some other restaurant would occupy this precious space on E. 4th"}
{"text":"Delicious food, big portions, amazing mojito. Server was very accommodating and added coconut per my request. Unlimited chips and fresh salsa. Pretty decor and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh  food. Meh service...I can check this off my list....we should have known when we had to wait for the hostess and no one else greeted us and the restaurant was maybe half full, this was a sign to go elsewhere...  This was after 9 pm on a Sat on East 4th..  We were finally seated, and we ordered drinks and food, had salsa on the table and had to flag down our waitress for silverware...once our drinks were brought out, I noticed it wasn't like it was described on their menu, the drink wasn't dressed with cucumbers for the Bloody Maria or the pepper rim. So I asked the waitress to bring some cucumber instead of making a new drink. She brought a couple of pieces wrapped in a cocktail napkin...ew Also my husband ordered the fish tacos. Not realizing there were two on the menu...I noticed after and thought she would ask which ones..but she never did...she just brought the more expensive mahi ones, which my husband exclaimed,\" I can make better ones\"   My salad was okay, the chicken was a bit on the charred side. I did like the chipolte vinagrette. But I could probably replicate it..  It took us a bit to flag down our waitress for our bill. We were very ready to go at that point..."}
{"text":"Not a fan.   I was expecting something a little higher end on E 4th.   Felt dingy and too much like a college bar.   Food was mediocre and drinks were \"meh\" - much better to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Some of my friends from out of town went here after not listening to my advice.  I meet them up after they were done eating.  3 of the 4 ended up vomitting from the food."}
{"text":"This was a nice place. The chips were warm which I really appreciated on a cold December day. I ordered two tacos, one chorizo taco and one house chicken taco. I was about to take a bite of my house chicken taco when I saw it: a hair. That's right, a HAIR was in my taco. I then told the waitress and she asked if I wanted anything else, and then she made us pay for our food. Bad service if you ask me."}
{"text":"Sunday night so the place wasn't very crowded. Mediocre salsa and guacamole.  Over priced margaritas. There are way too many other choices in the district that are much better.  I've had Mexican meals at the plethora of local joints that blow this place away."}
{"text":"I guess I expected a little better given that this is a touristy urban area with a lot of competition...would think the food would have to be more solid for the place to pay the rent.  Atmosphere was fine, and outside seating was pleasant.  $5 for a happy hour special beer seems a little overpriced, and the selection way too limited.  I realize people go for the tequila, but a few more beers on tap would be nice.  The chips were a little dry/stale tasting to me, and the guac was super acidic.  It was to the level of burning my throat, and just didn't taste fresh...something was definitely off there, and as I write this I have a stomach ache.  The mole sauce and chicken in the enchilada were okay.  The tamale was like eating dessert...the masa basically tasted like the sweetest corn bread I've ever had...maybe this is a style some folks like, but it wasn't for me.  The beans and rice were both WAY over salted, I couldn't eat either of them.  Too bad since the black beans actually had a really nice flavor and texture underneath all the salt."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out before attending a play in the theater district on a Friday night.  It was 5:45 PM and the Indians were in town that night.  We had no reservation but were quickly seated.  We were downstairs in the last booth in the back.  Strangely they sat two gentlemen right next to us at a table that was squeezed between the two booths at the end.  The table was literally 2 feet from ours.  It made no sense since the booth on the other side of the table was available,  We heard their entire dinner conversation, and they heard ours.  Chips and salsa were fine, although they didn't bring us any plates so we dipped and dripped on the table.  My wife ordered two different types of tacos and enjoyed them.  I ordered fajitas and they were okay.  The meat was plentiful and cut large, but like so many others have commented, the food was bland, very surprising for Mexican fare.  My wife enjoyed the music selection that was playing in the background.  Overall the experience was okay, not great, not horrible."}
{"text":"I've been here two times. This place has a fun atmosphere and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the 3 guacamole appetizer (try the sweet potato one). If you want to keep your bill down, go on taco Tuesday and get a taco with fish. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, very good service the bartender  Kevin was excellent ! The tacos very good, We had an excellent time  I definitely will be back, if you ever around 4th street check this place out."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chips and salsa, but that's about it. I could've made a more appetizing salmon at home :-/ Our food was not close to the $50 we paid for it. Surprised a restaurant like this is exists on East 4th and is as busy as it was. Cleveland needs some Mexican food revival."}
{"text":"horrible food & service - waste of money.  save yourself some time & go to taco bell for disgusting food."}
{"text":"Went here for afternoon drinks and this is by far the worst customer service I think I have ever gotten.  Our server kept disappearing and about 25 minutes after we ordered our pitcher and actually got the drinks the glasses they gave us were dirty.  I am not talking about bad water stains I am talking about food crusted to the inside.  Our server was no where to be found so we asked another that was walking by.  I watched the bartender put two more dirty glasses into a bin and have to hand wash two more just so we would have drinks.  Back tracking a little, we had asked our server for the check when she dropped off the pitcher because we had dinner reservations and she never brought it.  The booth seat we sitting on was cracked and uncomfortable and needless to say a terrible experience.  I will NEVER go back here."}
{"text":"On a trip to the city, my son & I stopped here. Mid afternoon during the week. Great service thanks to our server Andrew. Food was great. Love the location."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Indians game for some tequila shots. The selection was very good. Our waitress was outstanding and took the time to explain the different kinds they had and made her suggestions which were spot-on!! We sat outside and watched the crowds go by while drinking the Petrone and Judge Flights! Excellent!! Even the chips and salsa were awesome! We raved so much our waitress gave us some to take home. We will DEFINITELY go here again!!"}
{"text":"Go to Zocalo for the great food and ambiance (try to get a seat at the open windows overlooking East 4th), not for the service. Our server was inattentive on one visit, and inattentive and rude on the other."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. Was expecting the worst based on previous reviews. The place was packed, so we thought the service was going to be slow and food was going to come out lukewarm. The complete opposite happened. We ordered the mahi mahi which was hot off the grill, moist, and tasty. Also had the fajita, which is different than most (and assortment of vegetable not overdone) and enjoyed it as well. The fijita steak and chicken, were again, moist and cooked just right. Our server even refilled our salsa as we waited for our entrees w/o being asked. If there was a negative, the classic margharita was just ok."}
{"text":"Gave it a second chance..it was worse than the 1st visit.  Horrid food!  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick drink when you're downtown. The menus is not bad but, as far as Mexican food goes, there are better and more cost friendly places in Cleveland. Ok, not great."}
{"text":"Confronted manager about how bad the salsa was he says they don't put jalapeño or onion in.  I checked Websters.  Salsa is defined as a spicy tomato sauce with onion and hot peppers.  So essentially it is tomato sauce with oregano.  He also said they are an american chain and not a Mexican restaurant.  They need to change the sign I think.  Food including seafood was either old and dry or undercoooked.  \"White queso\" was orange like Velveeta.  Service so bad had to get another server to get the manager.  Had to eat chili with out a spoon. Music playing was nice classic rock which we liked.  Apparently can't rate zero stars so had to give them one"}
{"text":"Bad service and worse food. Expected more from such a supposedly good chef.   Chili relleno seemed like it was put in microwave. Enchiladas were bland.   Expected more.  Will not come again."}
{"text":"For how amazing of a location this is, the food is an absolute disgrace. Seriously you're making Cleveland look terrible. People (including celebrities, politicians, etc) come from out of town and find their way to East 4th and this is what we have to offer?? Seriously step it up. 99% of fast food places are blowing you out of the water."}
{"text":"Worst guac I've ever had. Totally flavorless. Their pineapple salsa is literally canned pineapple chunks in a spicy thin liquid. Their house salsa tastes like canned crushed tomatoes. The chips were uninspired, and I had to ask for a napkin several times before getting silverware and a napkin.   Don't waste your time and money on this place. Seriously, it was a bunch of old folks and first-timers with an awful atmosphere. Margaritas were a B- at best. That's they only reason they made a single star."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight, ordered the Zocalo pork chimichanga. What a disappointment. The chimichanga had more pork fat than pork, big chunks of fat? The sauce was bland, and the cheese became a big ball. The black beans were out of a can, and the rice was bland. The salsa and chips were the best part of the meal, should have stopped there. Had a margarita that was good.  We over paid for a mediocre meal, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I was really disapointed by my last visit here.  I loved it the first time I visited about two years ago, but service and quality have definitely gone down since.  I still love their guacamole (a co-worker thought it was way too overpriced at $10, but you do get a lot), but the rest was just ok.  Service was very slow.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent & the atmosphere was great! They had live music when we went but I'm not sure if they always have that or not. The location is perfect and it's a great place for a fun evening in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I had a great time, awesome Margaritas and combo Sat night.  So good I had to drop back for some more fun after the Tribe game today.  Awesome Cinco party going on there & packed with fun peeps having a good time"}
{"text":"The food was disgustingly nasty and barely edible.  The enchilada had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, none. How bland can it get?  Even with sour cream and salsa, nasty.  The strawberry margarita was flavorless as well.  The Mexican rice and black beans also very nasty.  There was no flavor to any of the items that I ate, none.  Very disappointing.    Server Derrick was pretty nice in a quiet non-descript way, that's possibly the only  positive thing I can say.  Also, sitting on the patio was quite enjoyable..  I would not recommend this restaurant at all.  A better option are the local Mexican restaurants that get it right; Mi Pueblo and Luchita's."}
{"text":"Terrble.  Everything is spicy.  Rice tastes like Uncle Ben made it.  Can't tell the difference between the chicken and beef.  Do yourself a favor and go to Cozumel.  Staff stands around doing nothing, doesn't appear to be a Manager anywhere.  One, overpriced mistake. Should have went with my gut and went to Flannery's."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in downtown Cleveland, the only thing I hate is the long wait during the weekend! The margarita is fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing to rave about, the staff seemed unhappy and stood around a lot. I waited entirely way too long for my margarita, I could have stepped behind the bar and made it quicker myself! Very pricey food for very low quality. I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody!!!"}
{"text":"I left Corner Alley and come here and I'm glad I did. Much nicer staff, and the food was delicious. Especially the carnitas tacos.My server D was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the enchiladas with chicken and a tall draft Mexican beer (whatever they happened to be serving at that moment). We were served chips and salsa upon our arrival. Everything was great. The food came out super quick and the service was very friendly. The beer was smooth, the chicken and salsa were both very flavorful. My coworker also very much enjoyed his tacos and margarita."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  Our waitress was stressed out before we got there. If you don't enjoy your job, don't take it out on the people who you expect to give you a tip.  Every time we asked for another drink (she never proactively asked if we wanted more) she looked so put out we thought she might spit in it.  The food was really bland. The chili con queso was as thick as liquid Elmer's glue. The taste was ok. The chips were way over salted. The carnitas tasted to be boiled and unspiced/unseasoned. The rice was definitely NOT Spanish rice. It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what it was described to be. The nachos didn't have but a few shreds of browned cheese & the jalapeños appeared to be added post cooking. The steak was well done when asked for medium. We were also told certain things were not on the menu or offered this day (Indians opening day) because they didn't want to use their glassware?!!!! All drinks were served in cheap plastic cups.  Please please pass this place up. Go elsewhere.  I made the mistake of not checking yelp reviews first... Bad mistake!  I was in town for business...   Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The reccomendations that I got on this place were to stay away.  I couldn't agree with them more.   I was here with a large party from work, and while the service was fantastic, the food was sub-par.  If this restaurant was somewhere in the west or east suburbs, this place would get a better rating.    The buffett that Zocalo arranged was on par with an over priced Chipotle.  Actually, I can now see the value of a Chipotle burrito.   Dessert was about as good as an easybake oven, although the pumpkin flan was pretty tasty, but still had the taste of a 'just defrosted' dessert.  I say stick with the tequila, and get nice and drunk and if you have money left, go to chipotle.  At least you wouldn't feel bad about throwing THAT up after drinking that much tequila because it is considerably cheaper."}
{"text":"Drinks are Weak! The tacos..fish taco  and the shrimp diablo wer pretty bad. A child could have done a better job of cooking. .I ordered the tortilla soup..dont waste you time as it arrived luke warm at best..tasted like leftover salsal was added, sprinkled with cheese and delivered to the table. Service was pleasant but slow. Never again will I visit this place!"}
{"text":"I got the Mexican chop salad tonight and it was so good, still can't get over how amazing it was!! But they messed up my friends order and the service was slow. But good food & the waitress was kind"}
{"text":"3 strikes - I'm done wasting my $ on the food here.  The drinks however,  get 4 stars.   Stick to the appetizers,  these seem to be ok."}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes to simply speak to the hostess due to the worst possible flow of entrees/exiters (who was less than freindly or timely), we were told \"my manager just said to put an hour wait on tables\", when the couple in front of my wife and i were immediately seated. I counted numerous empty tables in plain site. I understand some may have reservations in advance, but be mindful to those waiting to be seated at the door. Needless to say, we went elsewhere and likely wont be back. I gave extra star due to interior aesthetics only."}
{"text":"zocalo is one of the restaurants on e4th that seem to have just appeared overnight to me.  developers seem to be covering as many corners of the globe as they can over there, with the irish pub on the corner, house of blues covering southern cuisine (generically, of course), wonder bar (with whatever they serve....), saigon covering vietnamese, and zocalo, covering all things tequila related and mexican food with flare.    we went as part of the cleveland restaurant week, so we didn't actually choose items from the actual menu, though they are a sampling of what they offer.  i waited for my food partner in crime at the bar, and took in their drink menu.  they have enough types of tequila to get all of brazil drunk.  ...that's an exaggeration.  but they have some high end options for tequila.  and some low end too, if that's what you're in for.  i opted for a strawberry zojito, their spin on the strawberry mojito.  i was somewhat disappointed, especially for the price that i paid for the drink.  come with Money if you plan on drinking.  that's Money, with a capital M.  glasses range from somewhere around 8.99 for small glasses, 19.99 for a \"grande\", and then somewhere around thirty for a pitcher.    ..p.s. i'm now talking margaritas here.  other drinks range from a heckuva lot cheaper to a bit cheaper.  we had a pitcher of strawberry margaritas.  HUGE pitcher.  and strawberry flavored sugar on the sides.  not too shabby.  i dare say they rival johnny mango's margaritas.  and the sugar gave them a leg up on the mango's.    we took a glimpse of their menu for the special this week and thought we weren't in for much food.  this would be a gross understatement.  seriously, if you get a chance to do this restaurant thing this week, definitely do it.  for twenty bucks we had more food than i've ever had..  seriously.  i think they had to roll us out of the restaurant.  it's a three course meal, and you get to choose from the $20 options or the $40 options.  there didn't seem to be really enough difference between the two (and certainly not twenty dollars worth of difference), so we went with the $20 option. both getting different things, we sampled what there was to offer.  good appetizers.  the stuffed jalapenos were worth the cash.  the mango almond goat cheese salad was MASSIVE.  i took a picture of it, it was so huge.  if i get a chance, i'll attach it to yelp.  seriously.  burritos bigger than your head? no.  *salads* bigger than your head.  drunken chicken. hmm.  not too impressed.  kinda bland.  rice? kinda bland.  i could have done without the main course.  for dessert we opted for the eggless custard with raspberries and tequila (those were some *zesty* raspberries.  i actually had to avoid them they were so strong and just go straight to the custard) and also the chocolate nachos.   sounds impressive, but they weren't too good.  the chocolate isn't warm, the chips were the same bland corn chips with cinnamon sprinkled on them, and it was topped with those zesty and scary tequila raspberries.    ...they frighten me.  overall, it was a *LOT* of food, but not necessarily the best food i've ever had.  certainly not the best mexican.  i'd like to go back and try the guacamole they make at your table, since i love fresh guac.  and maybe their normal menu is more flavorful.    i'm on the fence.  i wanted them to be better, but they just weren't."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Everything was delicious. In retrospect I feel like it was good quality because Mexican usually talks back to me but this did not.   We have enchiladas, nachos, guac, chips and salsa, tacos, and quesadillas. Nachos were particularly good.   Good location, fun atmosphere, appropriate lighting, very nice owner who walked around and interacted.   Food came out quickly but not too quick. General service was a little slow. I think the waiter could have come to our table more often. We had trouble continuing to order drinks. But they were busy. We decided to continue drinking at another place.   Happy hour is too short. It ends at 6. Most go until 7 and the best go until 8."}
{"text":"Do you need to give at least one star or can you do zero???  We (husband and me) had our second dining experience in as many years here this evening.  This will be our last.  The evening started bad when the plate on the table on my side was dirty.  After waiting over five minutes for a server to arrive (one who I noticed was standing off from the hostess stand doing nothing the whole time!), I requested a new plate.  The second one he brought me was dirty, too!  I asked for another one and his response \"okay but they are all like that\".  Seriously?  Yes, I guess so because the third one was dirty, too.  I asked for the manager then.  She was the highlight of the evening.  She arrived promptly and apologized not just for the dirty plates but for her server's response.  She said they had a new dish-washing machine and she would check it and get me another plate.  She brought me a spotless one and also comped an appetizer for us (not necessary but very kind).  Unfortunately she didn't give us a new server.    Our meals arrived quickly but were not good.  The refried beans were cold, the rice was salty.  Their tortillas were dry on my steak and shrimp fajita-like creation.  It was served with veggies that would have been good if they were not cold.  I asked for no guac and double salsa but got guac (the runner who delivered the food kindly corrected this).  The husbands sweet corn mole enchiladas were \"okay\" he said.  Again, not warm.  How could food arrive so fast and be cold?  I don't understand this.  For desert we requested an order of pumpkin flan to share and I asked for coffee and more water. Our server told us they had no coffee because their machine was broken.  \"It's being fixed but we don't have any tonight\".  There's a coffee shop two doors down.  They have those big containers of like 40 cups of Joe.  Why not run and get some of those for the evening???  The requested water never arrived (surprise!).  The pumpkin flan was good.  That and the queso dip the manager comped for us were the highlights of the evening.    We will never return.  Our first visit of a few years back was not a lot better.  How this place stays in business must be the location.  People must assume since it is where it is (by some great places like Lola and Greenhouse Tavern) that is has to be good but it's anything but.  Skip it and go to one of the aforementioned \"real\" places!"}
{"text":"No point in even going.  Food, average to bad, the beans tasted old.  Wait staff seems rushed and uninterested although the manager was very friendly.  You can tell they are not appreciated.  The vibe is corporate, big box.  Prices are way too high for the junk they serve.  No originality.  Don't go."}
{"text":"Not what you expect or deserve.  The happy hour makes things seem not too bad, but if I were Aaron Sanchez, I wouldn't want my name associated with it.  The drinks seem not weak, but poorly made, and the food doesn't deliver on it's quality.  The choices sounds interesting and authentic, bit end up being bland, dry, or just average.  I have been here a couple times, but never reviewed it because I forgot I ever went there the second I walk outthe door.  That's about how memorable it is for me.  If it weren't in such a cool little area, I would never have gone after the first time, and doubt many would make their way out after getting their first try.  I could go on, but this place isn't even worth it.  Do yourself a favor: go anywhere around here that isn't HERE!"}
{"text":"Pretty sub-average food. Actually, I've had much better Mexican food in airports. Wife's quesadilla was extremely lame, filled with nothing. We didn't want to pay for it since she didn't eat it. Manager came over all huffy and seemed annoyed, almost arguing with us saying \"Well, that's our quesidilla.\" To which I replied, \"Well, it's lame and I'm not paying for it, take it back please.\" Honestly, for $2 less I could get a really good one at Chipotle that is thick and filled with stuff.  On a bright note our young server girl was very nice and apologetic. I see NO reason to ever go back to this place. Ok, maybe just for margarita's on the patio on E. 4th. Avoid for food but maybe just go for chips and drinks."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is always so busy. I don't know if it's because until recently it's been the only Mexican establishment on or near East 4th Street or people aren't adventurous to try other cuisine offered on 4th Street but it has me baffled. If this restaurant were anywhere else I feel in my opinion that it would be closed by now.  Knowing that I was coming here, I actually ate before arriving and planned to just drink. With that knowledge, I still had an unpleasing experience. For starters, the website states that happy hour is from 2-7pm then the menu at the restaurant states 2-6pm but our waiter made us believe it was indeed until 7pm. About 2 drinks and 1 Queso in he informed us happy hour was only until 6 and that they had changed it the day before. He apologized and did give us the happy hour prices because I mentioned the website but I find this to be a lack in management that they did not inform their entire staff of the change.  I came here with 3 other people and they each ordered a taco and rice and they waited almost exactly 1 hour for their food- for 3 tacos!! One of my friends also asked for a list of Tequilas because she was going to buy shots for the table and our waiter informed us they were working a new list but he would bring the old one and she could choose from that. Well when he came back he said they didn't have the old list anymore and then walked away. WHY would you walk away from a table who is willing to make a purchase and WHY is there absolutely no Tequila menu when the name of the restaurant is Zocalo Mexican Grill & Tequileria! If I were a manager and found this out I would be mad. Our waiter should have been able to rattle off at least 4 tequilas and include 1 extra that is of higher end.   What a ridiculous experience!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe, with a friendly staff, nice bar area, and plenty of seating.  The chips and salsa are quite good.  I had the fish taco and a Modelo on tap, both excellent."}
{"text":"The main complaint I had was the steak tacos were tough and hard to eat, the meat was almost unchewable.  The black beans had no flavor and the rice was just okay. The chips and salsa were great and the Prick-lee Pear Margarita was fantastic.  The server practically threw our food at us and our table was sticky.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. We were there in a busy Saturday night,  and service was terrible. Waitress was nice but not attentive."}
{"text":"Zocalo brazenly won another star during my last visit here. A friend and I wanted to celebrate National Margarita Day and she chose Zocalo. I was pretty worried about what was to come, but excited at the same time, since I could give this place another chance and see if they could make a margarita (I learned that mojitos are not the best choice last time).   We sat at the bar and got here pretty early, so there wasn't a wait time and we were met with less stressed staff members. The bartenders were really nice, though a little confused about their margarita specials at first. Once the confusion was over, though, we settled into a nice evening with some tequila and great bartender interaction. We also got some guacamole that was delicious (but, seriously, how hard is it to mess up guac?) and take out food later in the night. I didn't get to my take out until the next day and was pleasantly surprised. The baja fish tacos are delicious, even after a night in the fridge! The purpose of the fries with the entree is beyond me...fries with Mexican? But, that's beside the point. The food reheated nicely and was still delicious, so I can safely assume that those tacos would have been great fresh! Yay!   This still isn't my favorite place to go, but I think I'd come back for a repeat of this experience. (Arriving early, I think, was the best decision we could have made, since we made it out fairly early as well and missed the frat boy, tequila swilling, fist pumping and elbow bumping crowd.)"}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  The staff is usually friendly, but the service is generally slow.  The food is ok, nothing special.  The margaritas are awful.   The bartender also  charged my friend for the drink he complained about and barely drank.  I have been here from time to time over the years always hoping it would improve, but it never has."}
{"text":"Overpriced and under-flavored. Not a lot of desire to spend a lot of time reviewing a place that doesn't impress me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on a Saturday night and got sat right away.  Pretty cool atmosphere, and I thought the chips and salsa were very tasty, but that is about all the positive I can say about Zocalo.  Our server was decently attentive, but he seemed like he did not want to be there at all.  The food was OK....I ordered the cheese enchiladas with a carnitas taco - the enchiladas were decent but I have definitely had better, and the taco was very dry and bland. My husband tried the Enchilada Tinga Poblano and he didn't care for that either.  The refried beans were interesting looking and the rice was pretty bland as well.  We won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt after reading the negative reviews, I really did. So sad because I love Mexican places.  My advice: Go for the tequila. Tuesday night is taco night and half price margaritas! The selection of drinks is very respectable and quite delicious actually. Lots of options to choose from and the tequila quality ranges any where from Cuervo to Special edition Don Julio, Patron, etc. that can set you back up to $250 a shot, if you're feeling fancy.  I ordered two tacos off of their taco night menu and one was very tasty while the other was soggy and slightly bland. My girl also ordered a taco which unfortunately I am unable to review because they never brought it out! The only consolation is it made the bill a bit cheaper after we complained that we never received our whole order. Woohoo.  We also ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and it tasted like a microwaved Velveeta halftime dip at best. It was mediocre to start but once it started to cool and harden it was rather unappetizing. I would not order again.  A friend of mine ordered the chicken quesadilla and was surprised to discover NO cheese inside. What the what?  Go for some margs, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here after a game for a late dinner. We had been told they had good food & drinks. I should have checked the reviews - My bad.  This place blows! The service was nearly nonexistent, the salsa was bland, the servings were tiny, but at least the chips were stale..."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here and was TOO GROSSED OUT to even stay and order.  Super hungry on Labor Day, we ventured in here as it was one of the only places open.  We were greeted by the bartender who came up to us with a basket of chips, watched him take one out pop it in his mouth then put it down in front of us and ask what we wanted to drink-mouth full of chips.  We got waters, then he came back and he was rubbing his hands all in his greasy long hair, didn't bother to wash them.  Gross dude.  We dipped after that."}
{"text":"I was here for a holiday party and it was fun because of the people and not restaurant.   They had made space for us in the lower level for 3 hours, but they were also seating other customers near by tables, who must have had very bad time because of us. I was surprised that they were doing that. The servers were nice and friendly. Chips and salsa was good. All my friends enjoyed their martinis and beer.   I would not come here for a date just because I don't want to sit next to a group as loud and happy as we were."}
{"text":"New to Cleveland and was curious about this place each time I walked by. I love Mexican food, and was almost keeping this as a little present to unwrap at the right time.   My boyfriend and I peeled back its paper veil last night, and I wish it had come with a return gift receipt. He was excited to try the shark taco, but they were out of it. I had the carnitas taco - the pineapple mixed with pork was not a bad combination- Not unpleasant, not worth going back for. The guacamole was bland - 0 seasoning. A novice in the kitchen could pull something with more flavor together. I tend to judge my Mexican restaurants by the guacamole.   To add to it, the service from our original bartender was terrible. He was rude. There was another bartender who thankfully made up for the original Ambassador. Lastly, our drinks were the wrong price - 2nd bartender fixed it, which was nice but it just kept spiraling.  I was a little embarrassed as this was my suggestion. Barrio is close by ... I would suggest going there instead."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical traditional Mexican restaurant. It truly has an Americanized twist to it.  Some like it, some don't. I've only gone here for lunch, and the tacos a la carte are the best thing on the menu... their fajitas aren't quite right. Warning: you will over eat, and you will fill up on tortilla chips."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hyatt arcade in the fall and were looking for a nice place nearby to sit outdoors, have a drink, and people watch. My wife and I settled on Zocalo, and we were definitely not disappointed.  They had a good beer selection including several I hadn't seen before. My wife got a margarita and it was great. We ordered queso, and what we received was huge and delicious. At no point did I get to order an entree but the wait staff didn't seem to mind. The food we saw looked and smelled amazing, and I regret not having an actual dinner here. We liked it so much we actually stopped by twice in three days!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The enviroment alone is worth the visit.  When you factor that, along with the food, Zocolo deserves five stars!  Try everything and visit multiple times.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were seated and after 15 minutes no one came to give us water even, although 2 servers were working tables around us. We had to go back to the hostess station to ask to be re-seated (don't sit in the downstairs, it is dark and gloomy) and the hostess acted like it was no big deal we were ignored. We were re-seated but even after that the service and food were really sub par. And they were out of lots of the items on the menu (or didn't prepare them anymore). We would not return."}
{"text":"Easily the worst \"Mexican\" restaurant I have ever had.  I am never going there again.  I could fill this review with details about how terrible it was, but I think the one star does enough to get the message across."}
{"text":"A group of friends weren't treated very well at Greenhouse Tavern so we decided to eat at Zocalo's instead. I wasn't thrilled with the service. Our waiter was slow and not very attentive, but the food made up for it. Loved the chips and fresh salsa. We ordered the nacho's and my daughter had the burrito bowl. Loved it! Our friends had other dishes they really like too!  I would go back again."}
{"text":"For a downtown Mexican restaurant you expect nothing but the best especially when you are across from Lola's. Okay food, great atmosphere and service is so so..but So much more potential for Zocalo if the owner cared a bit more for the quality of the food and service...I mean if your neighborhood Mexican restaurant has better quality food then why bother driving 30 minutes downtown to eat here.?!"}
{"text":"I went to Zocalo because I was craving Mexican food on a business trip in Cleveland and one of my favorite Mexican restaurants back home in Boston has the same name. There's no relation. Zocalo in Boston is good. Zocalo in Cleveland is complete crap.  I'll be honest, I have to strain to say anything nice, but I will: the chips and salsa were pretty good. Sadly, everything else went downhill from there. Actually, downhill would suggest a gradual decline...I guess free fall is more apt --  something akin to bungee-jumping off the hoover dam with a lead weight tied around your feet. It was bad. Really, really bad.  I ordered a 3-way combo of carnitas taco, chicken enchilada and beef tamale. It came with a side of refried beans and rice. I figured this would constitute pigging out, but the portions were miniscule. That's OK though, I wouldn't have wanted more. I don't think anyone in their right mind would.  The meal was consistent in the sense that everything was consistently bad -- it was all equally under-seasoned and dry. In fact, I can't honestly say the enchilada was chicken...it looked and tasted like the beef, that also looked like the pork. How is that possible? I'm not sure.  The refried beans were inedible. In fact, I would have preferred a can of 'Old El Paso' if given the choice.   The service was completely neglectful, but then, when you can't wait to get out of someplace, the wait staff can't really come fast enough to get you the check, can they?"}
{"text":"Guac sampler was the only thing worth getting.  Portion sizes are way too small for what you pay. My food was okay. I ordered a shrimp quesdilla that is supposed to have red peppers and spinich, which were not to be found. The salsa had no taste and was watery. You pay for location with this resturant.  Save your money and go to Momocho!"}
{"text":"Started off not so good but finished Awesome with help of Justin!!  Awesome service, great food!!  Thank you Justin!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Mexican food, A lot. But Zocalo doesn't really do it for me. I have been on a few occasions: for their Taco Tuesday and lunches with co-workers.  To start, the chips and salsa are good. Enjoyable with the right blend of spice and flavor. I just don't understand how the quality of this doesn't get mixed in with the other food. On taco night I tried 3 different ones. Two meat and one fish. The meat tacos were very difficult to eat because of how much fat was on the meat. I couldn't chew enough. The flavors were good though. I then moved to fish tacos. The fish was just ok. Over cooked and a little dry. It was almost as if they flash fried a frozen piece of fish and kept it in the fryer longer to ensure it thawed. For the lunches both times I have order a meat dish. And again the meat is very fatty, not lean at all. I am always picking out fat. I will say the flavors are good. They do a good job with the spices and seasoning. But thay have to do something about the fatty meats and not over cooking fish.  Service was acceptable for the most part. Although on taco night I was alone and had to keep getting my servers attention for another drink, my check, more salsa. She never checked on me to see if I needed anything. I had to initiate the conversation every time. When my food arrived they just dropped it on the table. No one asked if I wanted or needed anything else.  Overall, I am pretty sure I can find better Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time while hosting guests from out-of-town.  Our food was served quickly.  I had shrimp fajita's.  They were very good.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"terrible! was with a group of 10 for a bachelorette party. we had a reservation for 5pm. the restaurant was moderately busy for a saturday early dinner service. we arrived promptly at 5 and we expressed our desire to sit in the bar/patio area. the hostess told us that area was \"unreservable.\" they sat us in the dark basement, right next to the kitchen. the server was friendly, but slow. he had a trainee following him too. he stopped back 3 times before even taking our food order.  and then we waited for over an hour and 1/2 and still no food. four parties at the four- top behind us sat, ate and left before our food ever arrived. we asked manager if our food ticket had been lost. the server told us it was \"probably the steak that was holding us up,\" a medium rare piece of meat. conveniently sitting directly next to the open kitchen, we then watched the manager throw all of our 10 dishes together. once the food finally arrived, nearly an 1 and 1/2 after our orders were placed, the food was terrible.the beans were canned and under-seasoned. I ordered the  \"Quesadilla traditionale\" for nearly 8 bucks, which was just a fancy way of saying small crispy tortillas with some shredded cheese, and a side of salsa. i am not a fan of unauthentic ethnic food unless it is fresh and innovative, and this was far from. the box taco kits i've made at home have rated better. the manager gave us a discount on our bill for the wait. had the server attempted to compensate for the poor experience, i would have felt better, but I think he gave up on us. overall, quite a terrible experience with a restaurant in such a prime location."}
{"text":"Amazing service, very fast and servers are really nice, great food and even greater Margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch experience!  It happened to be taco Tuesday's so it was half off all the tacos on the menu.   They had several options.  Even vegetarian.   The meat was fantastic.  Great food and great service!  Two days later when I realized I left my payment card behind.  I called the restaurant and immediately felt relieved that they found my card and kept it safe for me.   Integrity and good food will definitely keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Meh. I didn't have the awful experience of some other reviewers, but this place was just sort of average. I also ate at the bar, so had a different service experience.  I stopped into Zocalo with the sole intention of just getting an appetizer with a friend who was visiting - we were hungry and had walked over to East 4th from the Warehouse District in freezing weather. But Greenhouse's prices were too high for our budget, and we were too cold and hungry to turn back immediately, so decided to just get some chips. The entrance is actually in an alley, which was a little strange, but it's pretty well marked. They also have a huge menu posted outside, which was nice.  The restaurant was pretty full and we were told there'd be a 20 minute wait - but the bar had some seats, so we wandered over and got a margarita and their nachos, which come with guac, salsa, and sour cream dips. I was impressed by their margarita selection, and got their cucumber pepper margarita. It was good, except as always I forgot that I had tequila and all tequila based drinks, soooo ooops. Not their fault though! They offer three sizes - glass (which is on the big side), grande (holy crap - like 2x size), and pitcher. There doesn't REALLY seem to be much of a price saving by ordering bigger though - my glass was $11, and a grande was $21, so I would have maybe saved a dollar if I had wanted two.  Anyway - the nachos. They were pretty good - they weren't as smothered in toppings as I'm used to, but were still good. The guac was really good too - but we ran out of all three dips well before we ran out of chips, which was unfortunate. I hate having to ration my dipping - and we weren't even being excessive with our scooping.   After the drink and nachos, we just decided to stay at Zocalo to finish out our dinner, and ordered a chicken quesadilla to split. Our waitress actually brought us someone else's order at first, but then got it right. The quesadilla was pretty standard, nothing to rave or complain about.   The bartenders changed shifts during our time there, which made it extremely difficult for my friend to order a second drink. I know that turnover can be tricky, but you still should try to take care of your customers!   Anyway, overall, it was a decent time. Will I be back? Maybe - I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if I was in the area I'd consider stopping by."}
{"text":"Fabuloso. Food Network fans note: the menu has been 'mentored' and 'designed' by Food Network's Iron Chef finalist Aaron Sanchez...flown in from NYC. He doesn't work there, although apparently shows up from time to time...like next week! (I saw it advertised in my hotel). The Service was weird, it WAS a Sunday night, but no-one came to see us for a while. That just annoys me. No excuses people!  The drinks were good...I only drank beer...I was on a budget! The Tequila menu, although pricey, looks UNbelievable.  Food: The fresh tortilla chips with fresh salsa and refried bean dips were the BEST I have ever had. Hands down. Makes me wanna move to Mehico. Serialiously.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were executed perfectly. Tthe two salsas worked well by themselves as well as together and it was a perfectly sized portion.  My partner ordered Carnitas. OMG. Amazing...Crispy Carnitas? Where have they been all my life?  The flautas for dessert looked 'to die for'...I was too full. 5 stars Zocalo. 5."}
{"text":"If you are planning a nice evening out , like a birthday party, or to impress friends or loved ones, well this is not the place to go. And if you get seated downstairs, then forget about it. You are really fucked. You will feel like a passenger in a titanic movie , stuck in lover levels.  We got seated downstairs for our friend's  birthday party and literally they forgot about us for an hour. Loud music as well , terrible seats, (we originally made a reservation for a \"birthday party\" )  We had to remind the server that it has been an hour for some appetizers and called the manager (which it took him 10 minutes to come to our table, even the manager call is late, wtf) and manager came over offered some bullshit tequila shots hoping to buy our happiness and keep us quite.  Food was great , service was just well if I could give 0 stars , i would.  So long story short, if you are looking for cheap food and wanna waste or kill some time , well you have come to the right place. Kitchen staff, your food is amazing but servers are ruining your food. Sorry, 1 star for ruining our night and getting everybody pissy on a fucking birthday night.  You can take your sorry ass tequila shots and shove it up your sorry ass service."}
{"text":"The drinks are good and the servers are super friendly (s/o to Sean Morgan and Patric), and the bartender Hannah is cool too. They let my friend wear a sombrero which was pretty snazzy. Nice atmosphere and probably one of the cheaper restaurants on East 4 with a nice patio."}
{"text":"This place has low ratings and it completely makes sense. The food was awful, the salsa and guac were completely store bought and not fresh. I wouldn't have minded except this is a mexican restaurant! The waiter was AWFUL, we were giving HIM customer service, all the way down until we got the bill he didnt even say \"Thank you.\" This place was not crowded at all there was a decent number of people in there, I have no idea what his problem was. During the night the employees were cleaning downstairs, my husband slipped on the steps and the employees laughed at him. This place is disgusting, it should have awful reviews on customer service alone... if you dont like your job, quit."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on this place I was not too excited about it when friends of ours suggested it. We were going to a show at Pickwick and figured it was close and relatively inexpensive, so why not?   Honestly, it's not as horrible as everyone makes it out to be. No, it's nothing spectacular or something to rave about, but it's not that bad. The four of us ordered margaritas off the happy hour menu, but we were told they had to be on the rocks because the slush machine used to make frozen margaritas was broken. Mine went down like kool-aid and wasn't very strong but very tasty. It was kinda awkward though because our server asked us if we wanted her to bring our drinks... Ummmm DUH!  Chips and salsa before dinner were great. Their salsa is actually really good. For dinner I ordered a combination plate of the spinach and mushroom tamale and a chicken taco. It comes with a side of rice and beans, I chose black. Everything was good. Not the flavor explosion I would have hoped for, but it wasn't as bland as people have made it out to be.   My friend substituted French fries for her rice and beans ($.99 upcharge) and holy crap did she get her money's worth!! More than enough fries for the four of us combined!  Overall, I would say \"mehhh\". Not something I would run and tell the world about, but not necessarily something I would avoid."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out as the place we really wanted to go to, The Brewer and the Butcher, was closed. We were seated quickly, but the waiter was a pretentious little douche. Got really huffy when we asked if they had Coke or Pepsi.   The real waitress came over and took our bar order. Just a Dragonberry mojito for the lady. They were out of the Dragonberry. So she just got a regular one. It was average at best. A bit weak if you ask me.   We tasted the salsa that was brought out. The chips were fresh and very good. The salsa was the definition of bland. Basically just \"tomato water\". If you want to try a more flavorful salsa you need to pay $3 extra. I got the El Diablo salsa as I like it spicy. It was just the \"tomato water\" again with what tasted like Franks Red Hot dumped in it.   Gf ordered the chicken burrito and said it was really good. I got the steak chimichanga with refried beans. The beans were more like soup and were ice cold. Waitress said the were just heating things up in the kitchen. No excuse for cold food. The chimi was average even though it was chicken and not steak. At this point I just dealt with it. We asked for a box when the same douche that sat us came over. He seemed really bothered that we asked him  We've tried a few restaurants in this area. We won't be back to this one. I don't expect it to be here for much longer if the food doesn't improve."}
{"text":"Had to make a quick decision because it had just started raining. I guess with a location like this you don't have to focus much on food or drinks to get people to come in.  The outdoor patio and open air bar area are nice. I asked for a blood orange margarita with no sour mix, the waiter did his best to convince me their sour mix is \"organic and house-made\" but I don't like sour mix. It was good without it.  Ordered the carnitas with a side salad. This was some of the worst pork I've been served in my life. Fatty, over spiced, yuck. Served with some pieces of pale pineapple and pickled stuff.  Side salad was mixed greens with 2 slices of tomato without even the offer of dressing.   All in all, a tourist trap. And we got caught. :("}
{"text":"We went here Saturday night and had a 6:45 reservation.  We were seated promptly but that was all that was prompt about the evening.  We ordered drinks and the table side guacamole (which is awesome!).  Our server told us it would be a few minutes before he could make the guac.  And a half an hour later, he made the guacamole.  We were about halfway through out drinks when that happened and he said if we wanted another drink we should order now because the bar is running slow.    I'm sorry but when my server tells me service will be slow, that's horrible.  Things took forever.  Our food was okay.  Fish tacos and a burrito bowl.  Not sure if it was worth the wait.    It's a fun atmosphere, and I can see the appeal to it.  However, if I am going downtown and paying for parking and a decent meal, this isn't what I expect.  There are many other restaurants on East 4th that I'd rather give one of them a try before going back here."}
{"text":"A bunch of the girls were here for dinner for a bachelorette party.  The place was packed. Even though we had reservations, we had to wait for quite awhile.  We finally got seated and it took forever to order drinks and even longer to get our drinks.  My drink was so strong that I actually had to add water to it! And even then it was barely drinkable.  I wasn't impressed by the menu options.  We ordered the queso dip as an appetizer which was the only thing that night that I liked.  The service was slow the whole night and dinner took over 2 hours, and that doesn't include the time we had to wait to be seated.  The waitress refused to split our checks so a bunch of the girls had to run out to an ATM. The bathroom was very small and dirty, there was always a huge line.  Not impressed, pretty expensive, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The happy hour drink specials are great, and the food could be worse. However, it's a Mexican restaurant and they couldn't even cook chips. WE had multiple batches of chips come out that were soggy. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that couldn't drop chips in a deep fryer. Kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"I did not consult Yelp prior to going out for dinner, if I did, I might not have selected Zocalo... the service was good, but the food was okay minus... I was disappointed... I had a combo with a carnitas taco and a tamale... I take issue with the tamale... first off it was dry (that's a first, and offensive to anyone who likes mexican food)... second, someone tightly tied a decorative sliver of corn husk around the mid-section of my tamale (yes, other tamales were decorated in a similar fashion), which did not allow me to get at the second half of my tamale without doing some damage; since it was a dry tamale, the removal did not go well.  I hate to say it, but the only good part of dinner was the guacamole appetizer and the Negra Modelo."}
{"text":"I think the reviews here are a bit too harsh.  Or maybe it's just a hit or miss type of place.  Here is what I like about it: Great location Outdoor seating (patio and open wall) Awesome margaritas (although a little pricey) Amazing shredded beef.   I was not a big fan of the beans and rice and thought the salad, gauc and salsa was good, but nothing exceptional.  I would have left saying the place was just \"ok\" until I bit into the beef burrito.  It was amazing.  I loved it.   So I guess to play it safe, get the beef."}
{"text":"I came here once years ago, probably 2012 but I didn't post a review, and it was awful. Not much has changed. The drinks taste watered down and the food was...bland lack luster. It's what I would expect from a chain restaurant. But the chains are actually better. If you went to Abuelos you'd get better food for same or lower price.   The space is beautiful and the service was pretty good. She didn't seem surprised that we didn't like the food."}
{"text":"What to say about this place?? It looked inviting.. that's about as good as it gets for me. I knew that going into a place right in Downtown Cleveland with no wait and both Indians and Cavaliers are playing that night wasn't a good sign. TERRIBLE service (she got our orders wrong 3 times) and bland food accompanied by burnt yellow rice. Never again Zocalo, never again! stay away and you're better off going to a Taco Bell for \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try East 4th for dinner before the Indians Game. We came across Zocalo's and thought we try this for our dinner.Unfortunately, we made the wrong choice. First the waiter was excellent and then it goes down from there. My dinner was cold and was very blah. I ordered the enchiladas with rice and refried  beans. There was absolutely no flavor after getting through the chilled food. I hope they get their act together in the kitchen, they could have a Gold Mine."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better is the perfect description for this restaurant. The location and atmosphere for the Zocalo screams success. Nestled in to a prime location on fourth street in Cleveland, Zocalo has a perfect patio which is highlighted by sunlight as a result of a chasm in the buildings across the street. But the walk down the alley to the main entrance should serve as a warning, things are about to get dark. The interior of the restaurant has a mostly functional setup with a few outlier tables, which of course was where my party ended up seating. (Not a knock, I understand reservations and not overseating servers) Moving onto the actual dining experience, it took 5 minutes for chips and salsa to arrive, which predated the arrival of our server .( in hindsight we should have escaped.) After ordering our food our drinks were tended to on a relatively acceptable schedule, reaching empty a couple of times but with an offer to replace following shortly thereafter, however the food was another story. One order involved shrimp which had obviously been on the grill for too long and the resulting char overpowered the other ingredients in the dish. Another entree had goat cheese which when combined with the other components of the dish resulted in a chalky dirt like taste, but when served cold with hot sauce actually resembled an edible dish. There was also the issue of side dishes in which a recommended substituiton resulted in an unmentioned upcharge (the upcharge not a big deal, but at least mention the fact that the price will be increased.) With regards to the overall experience, the nachos I got at Progressive Field had better taste (canned jalepenos, viscous cheese like substitute, and day old salsa be damned) and the drinks and atmosphere at the other establishments along 4th street were much better. As one of my dining partners stated \"Don't let Zocalo get you down.\""}
{"text":"Really liked the vibe of this place but could have done without the big screen tv's with volume that was way too high. True we were there while Ohio State was playing but I think having the sound that high in the dining area is a bit of overkill. Service was very good. Enjoyed the fresh chips but the salsa could have used a bit more seasoning.  My friend and I split a pitcher of  the Clasico Margaritas and Empanadas de Carnitas. The drinks were nicely mixed with a healthy pour of tequila so no complaints. The Empanadas were excellent. Piping hot with a really nice flavor to the meat/cheese filling. For dinner she had the black bean/veggie burrito and was underwhelmed. I had the Enchilada Tinga Poblano. The sauce was excellent but there was simply too much of it. The pork was dry in some spots and way too salty in others.   We ordered the churros for dessert and they came out cold without being rolled in cinnamon/sugar. The 3 sauces for dipping were quite yummy. The waitress stopped by to ask how things were (guess she noticed we didn't eat much of the dessert) and we mentioned them being cold. Without even asking she took them off the bill.  If I'm ever in Cleveland again I would try this place again. However I may stick with drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Ordered 7 \"margaritas\" for the table and all were absolutely undrinkable, pure sour mix. Food was terrible, carnitas was extremely over cooked and was sent back. Would have been better off with Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my Mexican restaurants in the Cleveland area. While the food still remains good, the service is weak.  First off we did not receive the appetizer we ordered. Our main course was delivered and it dawned on the server we hadn't received our appetizer. So without asking us if we still wanted it, he bought it out to us. He did not even offer to comp it.  As for the main course, my choice of sauce was placed on my wife's enchilada and vice versa. We didn't complain because the food was still good. But ultimately you want what you ordered. Why, all of a sudden, do servers feel they don't need to write orders down?  This is the 3rd time in a row I've left Zocalo feeling that the servers just don't care."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. I was visiting my friend in Cleveland and we were downtown trying to find a place to eat. We only had a few options at 3:30 because lots of the other restaurants in the area were in between lunch and dinner service.   We walk into the restaurant and we are greeted with two employees doing the tango.....Ummmm okay. So we get seated by the window near the bar. The waitress came and first thing she said was \"why were you seated here\" we had asked the person who seated us to let us sit there since there wasn't a lot of people in the restaurant and she had agreed. We explained, the waitress said \"oh okay not sure why she sat you here but okay.\" Now why does that matter!?!?!?! Ain't NOBODY else in this restaurant.  We order drinks and the order was sent to the bartender who then proceeded to yell \"peach mango margarita!?!?!?! Why would you do that!?!? Oh come on girl!?!?!?\" I've never heard any bartender yelling back orders and making jokes but hey maybe it's a Cleveland thing.   The waitress was terrible. During our time at the restaurant she was on the phone (while taking our order and while walking away from us), stepping outside to bum a smoke, and getting our order incorrect.   Now the food. I am from California so I have high expectations when it comes to Mexican food. I ordered the veggie quesadilla and a fish taco. Both of which were edible at best. No flavor at all. My friend had two shrimp tacos. She said they were okay. We had to pay an extra 1.00 for guacamole...normally quesadilla comes along with salsa or guacamole and sour cream. But none of that came along with my meal. Anything added (condiments) cost an extra 1.00 or 50¢ or something. I was surprised we didn't get charged extra for the hot sauce!!!   If you just want chips and salsa and drinks this is your spot. If you don't care for customer service come on down to this place. If flavor is not important to you then order off the menu.   I won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was okay. I love Mexican food and this place didn't curb the craving. I don't know something about it, wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The place has a great look and atmosphere but the food is overpriced and small portions. I ordered a portabella mushroom fajita and a pitcher of margaritas. The fajita came with 4 small slivers of mushrooms, and squash and zucchini soaked in oil. When I asked the waitress what veggies came with it, she said onions and peppers; so I ordered it because I hate squash and i thought it was just a basic fajita. Apparently the waitress has no idea what the food  consist of.  The waitress argued with me because she said I ordered a double side of rice and when I said I wanted what came with the meal she proceeded to tell me I was wrong. I always tip well but I just couldn't leave a nice tip for someone who keep telling me I was wrong, especially when she wouldn't give me the right food.  This could be a great place if they changed their menu and staff. Major fail."}
{"text":"**Disclaimer: Native Texan living in Cleveland  I've had a lot of good tacos in my life living closer to the boarder for most of it. So I have to remember that I live in Cleveland, and the tacos won't be UH-MAZING most of the time. But that's not why this place gets two stars.  The food wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. The service however...slow as molasses! I went here with a group of co-workers for lunch because we couldn't get into Barrio in a decent amount of time. We have one hour and we weren't going to spend half of that time for a table.   Enter Zocalo.  The restaurant is big so there were lots of tables. We sat outside on the patio since it was a nice day. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to say anything to us. By the time she took our drink order, we had looked at the menu long enough to order food too. Our tacos took almost 40 minutes to get to our table! And it was cold, therefore it had probably sat there for awhile before it got to our table. She dropped off our food and then left again for ANOTHER 20 minutes. My co-worker ended up asking the manager for service because we had meetings to get to. It took the manager asking her to wait on our table for us to get our checks so we could rush back to the office.   In summary, this place is okay if you are not on a time crunch. It is NOT a good place for your one-hour lunch break."}
{"text":"bad on so many levels!! by far the worst restaurant on East 4th!   I came for lunch with a group of co-workers, hoping to get a quick and \"good\" food.  The restaurant has a nice outdoor exposure for a breezy day.  It's a mash mix of cast iron lamps attempting to look rustic with wood; maybe shooting for a southwestern look?  The waitress took an ridiculously long time to come to our table even though there weren't many filled tables and at least 4-5 waiters staffed. The high point of lunch were the chips and salsa- we ate 3-4 baskets of chips and salsa before she even came out of with our beverages.  After 20-25 mins, she finally took our order.  Another 20 mins later, I got their house salad with grilled mahi mahi; the mahi mahi was dry dry with too much spicy bbq-ish chipotle sauce.  The salad wasn't bad, but not good either- the jicama was nice crunch to the salad.  It was edible.  I also got to taste a bite of their refried beans, which were really bad.  The beans were dry and almost can-like, except worse. At least a can of El Paso beans are moist!  It was okay priced for lunch, but over priced for quality."}
{"text":"I've been to Zocalo twice and was completely underwhelmed on both visits.  The first time I went was for happy hour, and we stuck with margaritas.  They were good, and at $5 each, the price wasn't too terrible.  Still, I've experienced better.  The second time I went was for a group dinner.  Our waitress was very friendly, which is always a plus in my opinion.  Bad service can make the best restaurant terrible.  Unfortunately, our wonderful waitress couldn't make up for the lackluster food.  I will say that the house tortilla chips are pretty decent, just beware of the burnt ones because they'll leave a nasty taste in your mouth for a good 10 minutes.  You can order guacamole that is made table side, at least in theory.  My idea of table side guacamole is one of the chefs coming out with a cart of fresh ingredients.  At Zocalo, the server makes it and all of the ingredients are pre-chopped, including the avocados.  You do get to request which components you want and which you don't, so that's a bonus for picky guac. eaters.  The end result was fresh, but tasted more like avocado than guacamole.  For dinner, my boyfriend and I split a chicken quesadilla and carnitas.  The quesadilla is definitely nothing to write home about.  I could easily make the same one on my own kitchen, except mine would actually have flavor.  I found the pork shoulder in the carnitas to be overcooked, but my boyfriend didn't mind as much.  The carnitas came with rice which tasted like it was prepared from a box.  The best part of Zocalo is definitely the margaritas, if you have a bartender that doesn't skimp on the tequila.  My boyfriend and I split a pitcher (a very large pitcher, I might add) and didn't even get a buzz.  However, I remember the margarita from my first trip being much more potent.  All in all, I recommend skipping this place, which is unfortunate because it is a rather cute establishment.  Go across the street to Lola instead."}
{"text":"The dinners are overpriced, but I've been satisfied with the quality of food. The guacamole is great. I don't really recommend this place for a great dinner, but for snacks and drinks before a game or show, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Dammit, Stephanie. You love Yelp. Why didn't you check Yelp before you walked in?  Sammi and I arrived in Cleveland at 7:30PM very hungry. We knew we were staying in the Gateway District, and I told her that we can just eat when we arrive because there are many restaurants and bars in that area. Instead of checking Yelp like logic would tell me to do, we decided to walk around and see what looks good. Barrio was right next to our hotel, and if I would have checked Yelp, I would have known it was a good choice. Instead we decided to walk more and see what our options were, but we didn't make it long because we were a little chilly and STARVING. We decided on Zocalo because how do you mess up Mexican? According to Zocalo, pretty easily.  We walked into their entrance, which is located in a side alley off E 4th, and was semi-greeted by a very apathetic hostess. Bar or dining room? was all she mustered off to us as she hastily sat us down at a bar table next to the window. Our seat was a great place to people watch, especially on a Friday night downtown.   It took at least ten minutes for our waitress to get to us, which was especially frustrating because it was obvious the restaurant wasn't busy yet. The Cavs game was only in the third quarter, and the restaurant wasn't even at half occupancy. The waitress behind us was entrapped conversing with the table behind us, which I guess is fine, because I'm going to assume that she didn't know these people. She talked to them like they were her friends, but their conversation leaned on them being out-of-towners as well. Another waitress finally came around (I didn't keep a time clock, but we sat there for long enough time to where I wondered if we were supposed to order at the bar), and she seemed rushed and annoyed that we were even there. She took our drink orders quickly, and she didn't even ask if we were ready to order. We obviously were because we had sat there waiting for eternity for someone to acknowledge us!   When she came back with our drinks (Sammi ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and I ordered a pomegrita), she took our food orders. We ordered a chorizo queso, and Sammi had a quesadilla tradicional while I had the quesadilla suprema with chicken.   The margaritas were absolutely horrendous. We each ordered a grande of our margaritas both lamented about how watered down they were. We ordered grandes and didn't even feel a slight buzz. Maybe chalk it up to being college students with high aptitudes for alcohol, but I should feel something when I order a $20 margarita.  The food arrived quickly; so quickly that the quesadillas arrived before our queso. The waitress gave brought the queso right afterward; I understand that it was $5 but that queso was TINY. Like as tiny as the side guacs you get from the suburban tex-mex joints in our respective cities. It was delicious, and I'm very picky on my quesos. It wasn't drop dead delicious like the chorizo queso at Bakersfield in OTR, and it reminded me a bit of Skyline chili dip (non-Cincinnatians look it up; it's easy and dank), but it definitely served its purpose - which I think was to supply to only flavor of the meal.  Sammi ate her quesadilla without complaints, but I think that's because it's super difficult to mess up a cheese quesadilla. Plus she was a little more than hungry so she practically devoured it. My quesadilla on the other hand, was atrocious. It looked wonderful and promising, but my first bite was underwhelming. It lacked any sort of flavor or seasoning and the refried beans and jalapeños were the only flavors available. I was disappointed, to say the least. I LOVE quesadillas, and it was more than saddening that it didn't deliver.  When Sammi and I left, not one hostess or waitress said goodbye. Poor customer service combined with abysmally flavorless food creates an experience that's remembered for all the wrong reasons. As a couple of Clevelanders pointed out to me while I was at a different bar, Barrio is the place you need to go for tex-mex in the Gateway District."}
{"text":"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.    This place is disgusting. They try to do a fusion type mexican but fail so miserably. The portions are very small for the large price tag ( $40 + for a margarita??). I ordered a combo plate, taco and enchilada. The taco was so dry it was hard to get down even with water. The meat inside was also dry. The enchilada had 1 chunk of cheese and no sauce- isn't that the point of a enchilada- the sauce? Also, pretty sure the rice is Uncle Ben's.   Service is even worse. Our waitress argued with us because she thought someone ordered double rice. She even went as far as saying, \"you are wrong.\"   Avoid. This place may look amazing and have a great location but it's disgusting."}
{"text":"I've had the misfortune of eating here twice, and neither time was necessarily by choice. The first time a group of friends and I made the mistake of going out on the night of Indians' opening day, and it was the least crowded restaurant we could find. First off, the place is decorated like someone's idea of a cartoon cantina, and the menus are laminated, Applebee's style. Class, all the way. One of my friends ordered one of their specialty drinks--I really wish I could remember what it was called so I could warn people about it. She passed it around the table and we all judged it completely repulsive before she sent it back. Besides that, the chips were stale and our waiter knocked our salsa over. Not a good first impression. I only went a second time because it was the only place opened for lunch on a Sunday. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I couldn't make better at home, and the options were a little limited.  To conclude: The decor is tacky, the service is meh, and the food is mediocre at best. There are way better places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Most watered down margaritas I've ever had. No vermouth for the one person in our party who wanted a martini. Chips and salsa are fine. Their idea of hot sauce is Cholula."}
{"text":"I went here and had the taco salad with shrimp. It was tastey and refreshing to have salad as an option. It was fairly nondescript but also no faults to call out :)"}
{"text":"Oh Zocalo, how have you let me down?  In so, so many ways.  Let's begin with my reservation.  Sitting me and my party next to a gaggle of 10-year old ballerinas, no bueno!  Changing my table, not a huge deal, but let's discuss the DRAFT that happens from your entrance to the downstairs tables.  Have you heard of an isinglass door?  PLEASE INVEST IN SOME!!!  Every single table was putting on their coat due to the huge, and I am not exaggerating, the huge draft that occurred each time your door opened.  While our server was sweet, she was not on her game.  One of my pet peeves....asking for refills.  Darling girl, it is water, soda, and ice tea....don't ask....do.  Fill 'er up, and before I'm praying the ice melts because I am so parched. Truth be told, the chips and salsa were the highlight.  Oh, and the marg.  The marg was good.    My poor mother, who I was taking out to celebrate a few milestones, ordered a fish entree which, to say the least was overcooked.  If only she had said so prior to eating more than a bit.  That was the nastiest, overcooked fish that I have had since mama charred some fish-sticks back when I was 5!  Chef, please don't kill the fish over and over again!    Overall this was a poor experience and I have no desire to return unless I have a hankerin' for some chips, salsa, and a marg.  And I may opt for the better, cheaper version at the Rush Inn in Lakewood.    Actually.....someone call the Rush...I'm comin' over!"}
{"text":"I usually like Zocalo and I was a huge fan when it first opened. It has an awesome atmosphere, great chips and queso, and a pretty good margarita selection. But the last few visits I've had there leave me feeling like management is really starting to let it go. You would think they'd be putting in more effort to compete with the success of Barrio practically right next door to them.   This is what happened the last couple times I've been in:  - My friend's Margarita tasted like the cleaning solution they use to wipe down tables. There was a faint yet distinct aftertaste of Clorox. At least they replaced her drink.  - My boyfriend got food poisoning from the chicken fajitas last night. He was up all night regurgitating his food.  - While small in comparison to the previous two, my dinner was over-seasoned.  - Environment: the downstairs is now more of a dingy, break room than a second dining room. On both the main floor and downstairs, some of the booths are in disrepair, the seat cushions are ripped.   In summary: Barrio is better - it's worth the wait for a table. Zocalo is over-priced and not what it used to be -- it's sort of like playing food poisoning roulette."}
{"text":"SAVE YOURSELF- do not waste your time here.  There are so many places to eat in Cleveland and this is not one of them.  Dont even bother going for happy hour.  Here is my review of a recent happy hour visit. Tacos-Yah its dollar taco night if you just get plain chicken or beef.  All the rest of them are starting and $3 and going up. Food-HORRIBLE.  I had a $6 taco consisting of shrimp and steak. The shrimp were undercooked an did not resemble shrimp at all.  It was some kinda gelotenous glob. Dont even get me started on the steak.....errr beef jerkey. Service-SLLOOOOOOW Location-Awesome....gotta love its proximity to everything but that is the only good thing about this place. THE SKINNY: If you really are thinking about going why dont you give me $20 and Ill take you out back and kick you in the nuts.  Trust me my option will be quicker and more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Great atmosphere (upstairs). Dug the open feel to the outside.  Only disappointment was I wanted to order the shark taco but they were out so I was offered the cod taco instead.  It was good, not great.   I would come back."}
{"text":"Worst service and food. Only Mexican food place close to where we were staying. Should have gotten in the car and gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a great time, tequila selection was awesome and the bartenders were knowledgeable, will go back when we are craving a shot of high end tequila."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our decision to go here! Could have went 5 minutes up the street for some real Mexican. But decided to try something new. Bad idea! Margaritas were ok but not booze in them! All the food was lacking flavor and seasoning! What blows my mind is that the manager couldn't even come to the table and apologize or address the issue! They definitely need some work! Being downtown and all! Waste of money! Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just over priced airport food. Weak drinks. Just ok service. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Took a spontaneous trip to Game 4 of the 2016 NBA Finals and while exploring the area we thought margaritas and tequila would be a perfect way to kick things off before the game. It was indeed but this place is very OK. They have an outdoor area and we were seated near the window which was nice to feel the breeze. We mostly drank and the margaritas were pretty good but a little bit more on the sweet side. It could've had just a tad bit more tequila to kick it up a notch. I don't like drinking alcohol that just tastes like juice personally and some of the margaritas did like the Mango one. I did enjoy my Mexican Mule though! The chips and salsa we got on the table were again OK. The chips were SUPER salty where I found myself brushing the salt off of the chips. I did end up ordering 1 shrimp taco as well which again was OK. I think the theme of this review is this place is very OK. I think the one thing they have going for them is the outdoor deck and openness of the seats inside too. If they amp up their delivery on drinks and food it could be a 5 star place. Either way, this got us intoxicated for what was a great game to come. Go Warriors!!"}
{"text":"Hit up Zocalo for a girls night out with 7 of my girlfriends. By the end of the night, two of my girlfriends ended up going home early for the night because they got sick.  I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops - they were raw, rubbery, and completely inedible.  The bacon that wrapped the scallops was also raw, rubbery and completely inedible.  Sent it back to the kitchen so they could finish cooking them... still came back raw, rubbery and completely inedible.   I ended up eating a few greasy tortilla chips and canned salsa. I left Zocalo hungry and angry... but at least not sick like two of my friends.  I will never return here again."}
{"text":"The service was aweful!! Very rude and took forever to get drinks on a not so busy Monday night!  Fish was overcooked...however the guacamole sampler was worth trying"}
{"text":"First time I was here for the MAC tourny!  Ohio U party and I had a great time!  I want to personally thank Frank for picking up the tab!  Go Bobcats!"}
{"text":"My daughter likes Zocalo so we've been there quite a few times.  I've been underwhelmed nearly every time.  The location is great -- East 4th Street -- it's a fun-looking restaurant and I've had a few of their mojitos and margaritas and they are good.  But the food and service are lacking. We've had tacos, burritos, and other entrees and everything is just okay.  One visit was particularly busy and we never received silverware by the time our food arrived.  When I pointed this out to the server, he said that all their silverware was dirty.  Not sure how he expected us to eat our burritos without silverware, something I pointed out to him, so he reluctantly headed into the kitchen to find us plastic utensils!  I'm sure the location and decor will keep this restaurant around for awhile but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went in for a late lunch on Saturday.  Service was very slow.  There were 11 people in restaurant and it still took 20 minutes to get our drinks.  Waitress took at least 15 minutes to come back and take our order.  Food was okay but nothing special.   I went down to bathroom and all of the staff were down talking and eating.  Downstairs floor was so slick from something on it that I thought I would fall.  I have always wanted to try this restaurant.  Now I have and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pros: Good drinks Good guacamole  Pretty decor  Hipster location   Cons Reservations Waiting  Over priced Mundane food Not enough staff Won't use entire dining area to serve guest  Once you visit you'll see why it has 2 stars. If you do go just get a margarita and guacamole sampler. Then walk over to another restaurant for a meal."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland for the weekend , my friends decided they wanted Mexican .   At first sight , the ambiance seems pretty cool and definitely laid back . Our server was ok , he continued to mention that he was new everytime he made a mistake . Which was completely unnecessary .   The food portions see generous , a few things were a little too spicy and unpleasant. So if your intolerant to spice. Make sure you ask .even the guacamole and the side of rice were too spicy .   Amongst my group , I ordered the fajitas , which was ok . It did come to me not even sizzling but I don't really care .   Overall not a bad spot , drinks looked good too"}
{"text":"Merry Christmas, the best things at this place really are free (chips, salsa, water with lemon and the music). Tacos are not good, papas fritas tacos are awful. Salsa is yummy and chips are served warm. Queso is just Velveeta, don't recommend it. Guacamole isn't that great either. We ended up leaving most of what we ordered on the table."}
{"text":"If I were the country of Mexico, I'd start a revolution just to put this place out of business.  I have never had such bland, uninventive food in my life.  Honestly, it takes a real screw-up to take the taste out of plain beans.  Ugh.    For the record, I ordered a beef taco, chicken enchilada and pumpkin flan.  I'd love to be able to tell you what the taco and enchilada tasted like but there was no flavor.  Just the empty promise OF flavor.  The food itself  was some amalgamation of red and brown intagibles with bits of cheese stuck to them.  Terrible.  Were I not so starving, I would have thrown it all away or used it to paint a red and brown masterpiece on my cubicle wall.    The pumpkin flan was the only positive thing about my meal, for the simple fact that it has a discernible taste.  Honestly though, it's basically pumpkin pie with a sweet sauce.    Nice try, Zocalo, but Mexican food is just not your thing."}
{"text":"Came here before a Cavs game, so we were looking for a quick bite on a cold day. We were seated right away which was excellent seeing as it was busy. They had free chips and salsa and we also got a side of queso. The food came quickly, but it was nothing spectacular. The steak in my burrito bowl was almost burnt it was so crispy and nothing was that warm. Food was also very salty! Overall, it was just okay, but the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. I've been here a few times since I live very close but the food fails to impress every time. Tacos are extremely bland, even the speciality ones that are supposed to deliver on flavor are tasteless. They do have good drinks and happy hour specials.   Unlike other reviewers mentioned, I had a good experience with the service here each time. The girls are very nice and attentive. I think if they changed the menu a bit, they'd do better. They have everything else down so how hard can it be?   Nice outdoor seating, spacious indoor."}
{"text":"I really hate to write a review based on drinking alone. But shit, I'm a lush and sometimes I drink my dinner so .... deal.   WORST margarita I have ever had the displeasure of consuming. BAD to an embarrassing level. It was happy hour -- I don't care, it should still taste like something more than lime flavored water. My favorite part about this particular abomination was the fact that they add salt INTO the glass. This means that the very first sip of your drink is essentially lime flavored salt water. Total BS.   After slurping down the saddest margarita of life, I tried a sangria. It was bad but not terrible. I've surely had better. It tasted like wine flavored 7up.   Service at the bar wasn't too bad considering they were packed.  Most of the patrons were your stereotypical E. 4th Street snob.   Food looked yucky.   Next!"}
{"text":"We went there as family of three.  Never got greeted at door.  Then after 5 minutes greeted ourselves.   The hostess went to look for table.  I counted 7 open.   They had no reservations.  I asked.  A server came by said I can not help you have wait for hostess. Then a manger came by looked around like he was lost never speaking to is us once.  So we went to Flanneries had a great meal. This is second time there first time the food was just ok. There will not be a third.   I work downtown still will not go there."}
{"text":"Looks like other people had some poor experiences here, but I can say from my experience that this place is indeed A-OK.  Just nothing special.    If you're looking for decent Mexican food in an awesome downtown location, this is pretty much one of the few viable options.  I found the service to be good, though the prices are disproportionately expensive in relation to the quantity of food/drinks served.  Nearly $40 for a margarita pitcher and over $10 for guacamole...steep.    The guacamole was pretty decent: appropriately salted and flavor-full.  The cheese enchiladas were pretty decent as well, just nothing to write home about.  I do have to say one of the positives about this place is the physical space of the restaurant and its location on E4th.  In the summertime they open the windows turning the bar area into an outdoor patio-like environment.  Not a bad place to munch on some nachos and catch a late night game.    Come here if you are craving Mexican food in walking distance of downtown attractions such as the ballpark/stadiums, but don't come here looking for amazing food.  Go to Momochos for that."}
{"text":"I've been to Zocalo a few times and frankly its awful .. service, food and drinks are terrible... I'd just as soon grab a chipotle and a a beer than get food poisoned at Zocalo again.  Last time i was there half my table ended up puking before we left the place.  The chips are always soggy and the drinks are terrible.  total waste of a space -- although all the restaurants down there are awful at this point.  East 4 = RIP."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Zócalo... Tried once and was not impressed, so I decided to wait until going again to leave a review. Unfortunately, my second visit did nothing to change my opinion.   Generally just overpriced and under-seasoned. I found the food here bland and subpar. When you say you bring \"spicy south-of-the-border flair\", that's what we expect... Nothing that was good. Nothing that was even memorable.  Everything was just... \"meh\". With high caliber restaurants like Lola and Greenhouse Tavern on the same street, it pales by comparison. Thank god we have Barrio now downtown!"}
{"text":"Really cute restaurant. I went on a week night around 6:30pm and the place was pretty empty. We were seated right away and our waitress was very friendly. She gave us suggestions on drinks and food. I got a peach margarita and the three enchiladas. You can mix and match the three enchiladas which was cool. I got one mushroom, one chicken, and one pork. The mushroom one wasn't that great just because the mushroom texture didn't blend well with the sauce and cheese. The chicken and pork were delicious though. This wasn't my favorite Mexican restaurant, but I would recommend eating here at least once! The locations and environment is cozy and beautiful."}
{"text":"Worst quesidella and margarita ever. How do u screw those things up? Waiter was horrible. No personality. My friend has that steak queasidella and it tasted like rubber. Mojoto was nasty too.  Don't go!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Zocalo! The margaritas were fantastic and the food was pretty good. The staff was also very helpful. If the weather's nice you should definitely sit out on the patio, they've got a great view of East 4th street and overall fun vibe there. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"6 of us went here for the first time.  The location is fantastic and the decor is great, but that is where is stops.  We had to flag down the server every 20 minutes to get anything, she said she was \"Tired\" and was a slug walking around.  The drinks are very watered down and high priced, what you would expect for a location like this.  As for the food - Taco Bell would have been better.  I ordered the variety Entree that had a little of each of their main items.  I could not finish it, it was horrible.  The taste was just not there and they put the oddest things inside the dish to try and spruce it up.  All 6 of us were unhappy with our food and overall experience.  Here is our take on the place.  They must feel that due to the GREAT location on East 4th people will come no matter what, even if they use cheap food items and horrible staff they will get their money.  The location and decor is what drew us in, but we will not go back, EVER, and want to pass along to everyone else reading this to go someplace else - it is NOT a good place, certainly not in the same class as the other food locations in the area.  You just can't Skate along on looking good for too long if you don't have the real deal to back it up!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick dinner on a recent trip to Cleveland. Should have checked Yelp before going in. The space looks awesome. One of the nicer Mexican places I've been but little of it says Mexican. Even the background music was American contemporary music. Wait staff was inattentive. We sat around for about 10 minutes before getting our drinks ordered then another 10 to have someone take are food order. The salsa that came out with the chips was disgusting. It had a tang to it, like they used rotten tomatoes or something. I had the Beef Temale dish. It came out and the temale was stiff. It tasted like burnt creme of corn. The beef, the little that was on the actual temale, was tasteless. All in all, bad experience. Only highlight was the $5 Modelo Negro tall boy I ordered."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still in business. I tried it once and it was awful, but went back a few years later thinking maybe it had improved. The inside is really pretty, but I wish the food was good.   The burrito isn't terrible, but I'll never eat calamari after having it here. It ruined it for me. Try to think of all the words Chef Ramsay utters when he visits a terrible restaurant. That's how the calamari was for me.   I was fortunate that both times I didn't pay much. The first time was a date, and he covered the bill. The second time I bought a $25 gift card on restaurant.com for like $4.   If I ever come back here, it'll just be to drink. I'm never putting any of the food here in my mouth again. But at least the inside was pretty."}
{"text":"PASS ON THIS JOINT  Over 180 reviews averaging 2 stars are spot on.  The 5 of us stopped in here for a quick dinner and had: Chipotle BBQ Chicken, Goat Cheese Quesadilla, Mexican Chop Salad, Shrimp Quesadilla, and Agave Chicken.   I had the Goat Cheese Quesadilla which didn't taste very good and had no plate presentation.   This is clearly a place for young people to have a beer or two, get drunk if you're going to try the food and watch one of the 438 TV screens.  The service was poor."}
{"text":"Very nice location, atmosphere and crowd! Tasty Menu choices and good size portions! Price is reasonable, if you don't count trying to find parking!"}
{"text":"Probably more like 2.5 stars, but as one of the cutest looking places on this desperately-trying-to-be-\"hot\" new stretch of East 4th street, I wish them the best!  I'll start off by saying again that the place is very cute and festive, and seemed to be one of the more \"happenin\" places on the block for Thursday night happy hour.  The bar area inside is cool because the whole front wall opens up as a window and you're up high, so you have a nice view of the street, people watching, etc.  Very nice atmosphere.  The chips and salsa, which were delivered promptly as soon as we sat down, were delicious -- thick greasy chips just how I like them, and a nice fresh chunky tomato-y salsa.  Beer, margaritas, and sangria were on special for $5 during the happy hour.  The sangria was a little disappointing.  It was served in a tall glass (like a water glass) and didn't contain any fun little fruit chunks that seem pretty customary in a sangria.  However, the flavor was more than decent and I managed to gulp mine down in no time!    When we asked what appetizers were on special for happy hour, the waiter quickly rattled them off in a bored way.  If it's so much trouble for the waiters to list the specials, why not put them on a handy little HAPPY HOUR MENU that the customers can read for themselves?  Just a thought!  Most of the happy hour offerings sounded pretty boring: cheese quesadilla (come on, throw some chicken or veggies in there!), queso dip, fried calamari, empanadas, and \"sopes.\"  Naturally, I had to ask what was in the empanadas and what the heck are sopes.  Unfortunately for me, the empanadas were of the shredded pork variety (again- why couldn't they offer several kinds, e.g. one with chicken?).    I believe the sopes were described as a corn cake topped with black beans, guacamole sauce, and cheese.  Whatever the corn thing was, it was nearly impossible to cut through with a knife, and would have been way too messy to eat as \"finger food.\"    The place could be better, but could be worse.  I'd go back more for the atmosphere than for the food itself."}
{"text":"Decent place for Mexican food! Fun selection of tacos to choose from. However our server was not the best, she was extremely frazzled even though it appeared she did my have that many tables and it took a long time for our margaritas and even longer for water and straws. Other tables seem to have better service though. A bit overpriced for the portions."}
{"text":"Food was eh, nothing unique. I've tried much better Mexican food. Customer service not so good either."}
{"text":"Where do I start, the salsa was bland and watery as the pacific however the guac with black beans and corn was fantastic and that's where the good part ends. My fiancé and I both ordered margaritas I got the cucumber pepper and she got a pomegranate..... If you have been to barrio, momocho, or any place that makes good margaritas you've had better than what they serve here. After ordering and waiting 30 minutes the waitress came back to inform us that \"we are out of like half the menu and we can't make your tortas so here's the menu and you can order what you want\" we were on our way to the Indians game and this was just fantastic.  She literally gave us the menus back, did not apologize and did not inform us what they did or didn't have.... Because we were now crunched for time and did not want to eat in the stadium we both just pick fajitas and got the hell out of there. All in all, the food was merely ok from start to finish and combined with the below average service we will not be coming back. For the price we ended up paying, we should have just walked out and not even paid for the drinks after the out of everything comment....."}
{"text":"Awful experience here.   We had tickets to a comedy show at ten so decided to go to Zocalo before hand...bad idea. When the food finally came out the server handed me my plate without telling me it was incredibly hot which resulted in me dropping the plate on the table. The food tasted awful and did not come out as ordered. My friend ordered tacos and two of the three were wrong. The lettuce on my tacos and my friends taco salad had a ton of wilted, brown lettuce. I ordered a Baja fish  taco and the fish was basically a gross fish stick. Super breaded, fried and hardly any fish under the breading. When we told our waitress about the brown, wilted lettuce she couldn't have cared less. There was no apology for the poor food quality or for the incorrect food that came out. Needless to say I will never go back. Can't wait for Bario to open downtown!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food is super mediocre. Not a good Mexican place at all. Especially for the price. The atmosphere is really loud too. I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Wow. We ended up here after the wait for Barrio was too long. When asking questions about food our waiter was unhelpful and resistant to going to ask the kitchen.   The food was worse than the old Mexican restaurant I went to at my college and they weren't known for their food.   Their Queso was trash and almost solid with no spice. Their tacos blew and were tiny. They got shrimp mixed up with chicken. Lastly, their burritos were ok but the Mexican rice wasn't cooked and the beans were so damn salty.   I don't get this restaurant. Their drinks were ok but I don't get how that can keep them in business when the service is this abysmal.   Please save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this a second star was because it has a patio out looking E 4th.  The couple times (~4) and I have terrible service every time.  The food and drinks are way overpriced even from downtown/E 4th standards."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I met here for lunch.  I had been here before but not in quite a while.  We were presented with warm tortillas and salsa (which was just ok, flavor-wise).  They each ordered combo plates, which they liked.  I ordered the Agave Chicken Salad, which was tasty but not filling, and overpriced.  For $8.99 I received a very small scoop of chicken salad and a small 1/2 hand-full of spring mix with a few strips of jicama and 3 flour tortillas.  The chicken salad was tasty but not worth the $$$.   The restaurant should consider at least 2 scoops of salad and a larger portion of lettuce and jicama.   I will return to Zocalo, but not for this entree."}
{"text":"The drinks are great here, but the food is just ok. We've been a few times, and cannot think of a great experience. It's too bad because the location is really great, nestled in the heart of the hip 4th St area of downtown Cleveland.   Stop for a drink, before you head elswhere for your eats."}
{"text":"Fajitas! This place was very good. Great portions; really good service. The location on East 4th is a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I can't think of many restaurants I would actively avoid, but zocalo makes the list.  The large/overpriced margaritas and sangrias were basically ice buckets with some juice and no alcohol in them.  The service was slow, and the food, though more reasonably priced than drinks, was nothing I'd choose again."}
{"text":"The food did nothing for me, I ordered the steak fajitas and had a heck of a time even chewing the steak. Would never go back there for the food again- that' for sure.   Service was great, drinks were great, atmosphere was great. I would go back to drinks and chips & salsa. But that would be the extent of it!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. The only reason this place gets two stars is because you get free chips and salsa. The server was an ass whole never smiled and hardly ever came to wait in our table. He took 45 minutes to get a drink order and never apologized. The place wasn't even that busy. He had the attitude with the rest of the tables as well. I watched him go to other tables and he displayed the same attitude to them. I don't know how this guy still has a job. The food is average and I don't see this place being around that long."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour! Fabulous Mexico Mule and Chorizo Queso! And their Salsa is great!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were excited to try this! Drinks were watered down, service was very slow and the food took forever and tasted awful!! Beans hard chicken bland bad baddd"}
{"text":"Unless a large tequila selection is critical to you there is no good reason to dine here.  Everything we ordered was grossly over-salted and mediocre.  Good service nice space but too much competition on the East 4th Street block to drop another dime here."}
{"text":"I recently went to Zocalo for the second time during the dinner service. This place does some things really well and other things need quite a bit of improvement. For example, the guacamole sampler is delicious; the calamari was very dry and chewy. I tasted and enjoyed the chicken quesadilla, as well as the enchilada tinga poblano. The service was a bit slow, and the waiters made very silly drink mistakes; however, the waitstaff was pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"we went to Zocalo for dinner last night and had a lovely time.  I normally ALWAYS check Yelp before going to a place, but didn't last night.  wow, and I glad I didn't!!  I don't get all the bad reviews.  the food was delicious and the drinks were fantastic.  we ordered the smothered nachos, a spinach & portobello tamale, and a cup of green chile.  I had the blood orange margarita (and asked the bartender to go less on the sweet, which he did) and my husband had a more classic marg.  the food came out quickly.  the only thing that needed some salt was the guac we ordered.  the green chile was in no way crazy spicy like New Mexico green chile is, but it was still delicious.  give this place a shot and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised, as we were."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon to get a quick lunch. The place has the atmosphere down, too bad they have to work on the service and their food. Our waitress was quite short with us and gave the impression that she didn't want to be bothered. Maybe she was having a bad day, sadly that was directly reflected in the below average tip we gave her. As for three food i found it very average to say the least. I personally have to say some off the more popular Mexican chains have their flavors more developed than this restaurant. I simply found it very bland.  The plus side was their beer prices were good, but i can get a reasonably priced beer in places with much better service and with more flavorful food."}
{"text":"The place overall was okay for my first time. They start you off with chips and salsa. It was pretty good I recommend you get the queso it was delicious. The tacos were okay Ive had better. The one thing I don't recommend Is the fajitas they gave us 5 small pieces of steak and alot of vegetables. That was a waste of money for 15 dollars. The servers were nice and checked up on us every few minutes. Overall will I go back maybe one day because of the queso."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Very disorganized staff and kitchen. I'm only commenting on the food as we weren't there to drink, and I think the food is below average - thus the two stars."}
{"text":"Slow service  Salty margaritas   Recommend tamales   Good pre meal salsa  Kinda pricey  Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are complaining this place was great ! The food was awesome, with reasonable prices, and the atmosphere was exquisite! With the lighting setting a trendy ambiance. The architecture in this restaurant Is so beautiful. The chips were plentiful ! We waited a decent amount of time for a Wednesday though which is why I'm giving this a 4/5 stars. If it was super busy I could understand but It wasn't. However while we waited the waitress was awesome about bringing us as many bowls of chips as we wanted ! The queso was unlike anything I've ever tasted and boy was that good! I also got two tacos. The shrimp Mediterranean, which was my absolute favorite. And the steak Americano which was good too but nothing in comparison to the shrimp taco. We left happy and full of such yummy food! We will be back because those shrimp tacos were so worth it ! And for a reasonable price too! I think my total bill for two tacos and queso was only 12 or 14$"}
{"text":"Suffering from a deplorable lack of flavor, salt and anything resembling Fahrenheit readings above body temperature, the two star overall rating on Yelp is well deserved. The overwhelming sweet undertone to many of their dishes is typical of the area but in no way acceptable for my taste. Service and atmosphere are great, however."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at Zocalo's our last night in Cleveland. We were seated immediately. It is a nice sized space and well done. We ordered drinks and proceeded to look at the menu. My friend ordered one of their salads with guacamole, black beans, etc. I looked at the menu and there was an entire section for their signature tacos. I ordered two shrimp tacos with black beans on the side They were very good. Overall, it was an excellent experience and I would make this one of my stops if you are going to Cleveland anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. The last time or two I've watched it go downhill. The hostess was swearing because a waitress offered us a table by the bar (we were in a hurry and asked for a two top) even though she said no bc they are for tables of 4 or more. The food was lack luster, our waitress didn't care or offer drink refills. I spent the rest of the evening with a stomach ache and eventually up chucked my meal. Fun- what a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this only has two stars. Yes, it's not an uppity gourmet establishment but it doesn't deserve two stars. I had the Baja Fish taco and Chicken Monterey taco. Both tasted delicious and for a great price. Also had the blood orange margarita which was very good. It's not overpriced, especially for being on East 4th. Another plus? They're one of the only places open for lunch on the street on a Saturday.  2nd time here and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We gave our phone number when putting our name in for a table and were told \"you'll get a text in about 30 minutes\". So, after an hour..nothing. We go back and the hostess says \"I lost your number\". After she took it TWICE. We got seated and then the waitress was no good either. We had to ask for utensils, ask for water, ask for more chips, etc. Service is poor and the food wasn't all that great. Good for margaritas and guacamole though."}
{"text":"Dessert: we stopped in for dessert and coffee. Dinner service was going on so it was busy. Waitress was nice, but seeemed flustered,  didn't even give us napkins.  Dessert was good; Patron cafe ice cream over a flourless chocolate cake. Our coffee though, that was freshly made, was very weak. We looked over the menu and were inspecting plates of food as they went by. Everything looked great and we were disappointed we didn't have dinner here.  I am surprised to see the bad reviews, but think we'll still give dinner a try."}
{"text":"Some time ago, Zocalo changed their menu. I used to love the selection of different tacos...I can't help but think that the introduction of Barrio right around the corner may have had something to do with that. Ok, I get it. I won't deal with the crowds at Barrio, so I will settle for a more limited menu here (as compared to their old menu, which seemed more extensive). The food is ok - I ordered Tres Enchiladas with carnitas, and it was good, but the accompanying sauce was too salty for my preferences.  They DO have excellent fresh salsa, HUGE nachos, and their guac is really good, but the service is hit or miss. I have had good servers here, but this last trip, our server literally did not smile the entire time. She seemed inconvenienced to have to take our orders, which was noticed by all four people at our table. It seems like maybe the bar side has better service, and on a nice day, you can sit in the open air. On the plus side, our orders came out right, and this is a good price point among E. 4th spots, so we'll probably be back (again), even though we know the service will be a game of chance."}
{"text":"Some of the poorest mexican food i've had.  I grew up in Phoenix for years and I'm not sure I can even call my meal mexican food.  My enchiladas tasted like an over-zapped microwave dinner.  No thanks.  Its in a good location and the atmosphere is good inside the restaurant, but other than that not much going on here."}
{"text":"When I first went here when they first opened it was great. Unfortunately it has progressively gone down hill. The last time I was here two separate tables who must have known each other were literally throwing food at on another. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I guess people come for the size of the margaritas ....food was just ok.  Not much more to ay really.  Much better offerings across the street (Lola's, Greenhouse Tavern) and even down the street (winking lizard, Harry Buffalos)"}
{"text":"Cleveland has a lot of great restaurants. Why this one survives is beyond me.  The food is bad qualiy, wrongly cooked, and tasteless.  Also, the restaurant is super cheap when it comes to ingredients...you will get a couple of strips of beef or two tiny shrim and lots of rice - that kind of thing. Makes you feel like you are eating at a low cost version of Red Lobster (it is that bad).   It is in a fun location but I wish so bad people in Cleveland would not have to put up with this.  Go to Mi Pueblo, eat some real good Mexican (food) and then hit the downtown bars."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the reviews for here are so bad, I thought that it was fairly good.  A group of 7 of us made a post-wedding stop here on a Saturday afternoon after realizing that a couple of other places that had been recommended to us were not open until evening.  I split the Zocalo Quesadila Supreme, with chicken, minus the jalapenos.  It was delicious.  The description mentioned \"four tortillas\", which I took to mean two (or maybe four) separate quesadilas.  Nope!  It turned out to be four tortillas layered on top of each other, with the middle two deep-fried, and the whole thing loaded with toppings.  You might think that a triple-decker quesadila would require a fork and knife to eat without making a huge mess, but this one held together surprisingly well.  The combination of chewy and crispy, and all the other quesadila ingredients was great.  It is enough to share, if you aren't ridiculously hungry.  I did not try any other dishes at Zocalo, but based on things that other members of my party ordered, the margaritas are a bit pricey but also large and delicious (and come in a variety of interesting flavors), and the guacamole looked great.  Overall, decent food with average service.  Value was just alright, though their happy hour specials sound great."}
{"text":"swung in real quick with my cousin Paul and his wife Jen before meeting the rest of the Cleveland tribe for a night out. nothing like a little pregaming, no?  we had missed happy hour by a bit, so we made do with the specials of the night. $4 tallboys of Tecate for The Situation and Pauly D, and $8 for a giant margarita for JWoww. decent prices I suppose for a more \"upscale\" place.   food didn't look appetizing at all when we saw plates go by. the place is big, and the atmosphere looks pretty, but it also seemed kind of \"faux-classy\". the businessmen, cougars, and bros only added to that.  done, done, and I'm on to the next one."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Food was average at best. We were one of 5 tables and were left alone for an extended time multiple times. Probably will not go back. Our waitess didn't even say good bye or have a good night. Just dropped the check and left."}
{"text":"Mexican food is definitely one of my favorite types of cuisine. If you're looking for more upscale, not your average Mexican joint restaurant, Zocalo is the place for you. Their chips and salsa are awesome. A huge part of whether I like a Mexican restaurant or not is based on their chips and salsa. They have an awesome happy hour with $5 appetizers and margaritas...great for the after-work crowd. Their queso dip is excellent! The nachos were loaded with toppings and they too, were great. Really, everything I've eaten there has been very good. The margaritas were not too sweet or sour and are priced reasonably."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time on a Saturday night and didn't feel crowded. It has a cool atmosphere and food was excellent! The prices are really decent too. We went before seeing a show at Playhouse and I'm recommending we come here again at our next one!"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this disorganized mess.  Waited in line 10 minutes to order carry out, was never served.  Te seating hostess was clearing tables while the ever-lengthening line began to riot.  Tons of open tables, nobody was being seated.  When I walked out, so did the groups in front of, and behind me, in line.  #fail"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE & FOOD.  The waitress seemed to really take her time and not seem to have much steam in her.  When she decided to grace us with taking our order, she brings back a lemonade that plain as day is not right color wise and the syrup needed changed.  So I end up taking it up to the bar because she takes forever to come back.  The bartender brought my new, proper drink over.   UGh.  I really didn't realize you could mess up mexican that bad, but Zocalo proved me wrong.  Very flavorless food.  I promptly ordered food at the next bar we went to.  Really a bad experience and this was our first thing we did once we got to Cleveland.  Time to get a new manager to whip that place into shape.  Don't be lured in by the appearance!  One of the worst food experiences to date!"}
{"text":"just awful. only tables for two were wobbly hightops. place was nearly empty but took server forever to come to our table and even longer to bring our drinks. chips and salsa were the one redeeming aspect. ordered a combo with two steak tacos and a steak enchilada. steak looked cooked but was rubbery and tasted raw; very strange. the only discernible flavors were the pungent powdered cheese on everything and onions. otherwise strangely devoid of any flavor. the onion aspect stayed with me the whole day though. not sure how the food could be worse if they tried."}
{"text":"Oy! Zocalo, you just did not do it for me, at all.   This is coming from a \"silver-lining\" kinda gal, but even the location does not redeem this place. In fact, this restaurant hardly does this location justice! Harsh, I know--but on a street like E. 4th that's just littered with great restaurants and venues...you really need to be up to par.   My first (and only) visit to Zocalo was with a large party of about 12-14. Right off the bat I usually cut the restaurant some slack with bigger groups. I realize that it takes a lot of coordination to get everyone's plates out around the same time. I also understand the stress that it puts on the kitchen and the servers to get things right. But sadly, even with my \"slack\", it was just not good.   Half of our group's food came out 20-30 minutes before the rest of our table did. Again, I can appreciate that it is a difficult thing to manage a huge order like that, plus a full restaurant. So, although the wait was long, I forgave that. That was, until 3 of the orders came out completely wrong. Yikes.   The food? Well, I love Mexican food. The spiciness, the melted cheese...*drool*. This was not what I got at Zocalo. My food was rather bland for Mexican--so much so that I literally had to bathe my entire dish in their salsa. But hey, I love fresh salsa and Zocalo's does that right! (Redeeming quality right there.)   Some good things? Well, the servers were very sweet. Although there were a lot of mistakes, I'm sure it wasn't all their fault. They both looked so frazzled, so I made sure to thank them for taking care of us. Margaritas were tasty, not the best, but good. The homemade chips and salsa were also fantastic. Ironically, I filled up on mostly those waiting for my sub-par meal. It's like my body already knew what was going to happen!   I'm not saying that I wouldn't ever go back to Zocalo, but it wouldn't be my pick. I'd go with a couple of people for a happy hour and maybe some apps."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Drinks were good, Food was just okay - ordered the tacos and the steak was a bit chewy but had good flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday for lunch for 3. Started w a Margarita: didn't taste the liquor, but plenty of sour. Like a chain restaurant where the emphasis is on saving liquor costs. :( Baja fish taco: a little spicy, overall solid taco Chips: ok"}
{"text":"I am not sure why the reviews are so poor for this place! I brought one of my girlfriends here when she came in for a visit from Chicago (I am new to CLE and I just wanted to go to E4th cause the lights and stuff - it's cute!). We got a pitcher of margaritas and we each got the 3-taco combo. They were all spicy, even though they weren't advertised as such, but they were fantastic! I had the fish, shrimp, and beef+goat cheese (or maybe it's feta...). They accompanying rice and beans were delicious as well. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by Zocalo and was able to snag a seat outside- perfect for people watching on East 4th! They have an awesome selection of margaritas here. We ordered the Grande Sangriarita (32 oz margarita topped with sangria) and although it tasted delicious it was not very strong. For the entree I ordered a combo platter with a burrito and enchilada that comes with rice and beans. The food was pretty good but nothing outstanding. Good portions for a decent price though. Ambiance was great- fancy enough for a date but casual enough if you are just going out with friends.  Overall a good place to try out especially if it's nice out and you can get a seat outside, but I will likely go down the street to Barrio if I'm craving real good mexican food."}
{"text":"While being a beautiful restaurant the service was ok and everything is overpriced. Just seems like a very good concept but no bang for your buck. We weren't the only ones as the people next to us had to ask for many things including the check. Tacos are, in my opinion, a cheap good easy thing to make. Putting ur own twist sets u aside from ur competition but Zocalos is different in menu and prices. We had the roasted poblano and goat cheese guacamole and it literally looked like they added goat cheese and poblano on top of pre-made guacamole. Not saying the entire experience wasn't good, just what we paid wasn't worth it. I'd go back because the tacos were good, drinks were good, and service was decent. Atmosphere is great. I wouldn't go back because of the price.... I mean who wants to pay $5 for ONE taco?"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Guacamole was decent, but not spicy enough (even when we asked to have it spicy).  Mole con pollo was decent."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday before a concert at Quicken Loans.  Restaurant was not super busy yet we were seated in the basement at the worst table in the restaurant - under the stairs by the kitchen.    Very noisy chaotic and messy. There were better tables available. We should have asked. Ordered a pitcher of margaritas. They tasted watered down and like they forgot the tequila. My husband got the 3 enchiladas which he liked. I got the tostada salad which was just okay."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Hyatt Arcade and decided to take a walk down East 4th street last night and saw this place and decided to stop for a drink. We walked in and it had a fun atmosphere. We got a patio seat which is first come first serve. The server greeted us quickly with complementary chips and salsa. We ordered drinks and a side of queso for the chips. This queso was very simple but it's exactly how I like it. Definitely rate it 10/10."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Zocalo over the last year and a half on several occasions.  I've always found the food to be great.  I love their chicken and shrimp fajitas, their homemade chips and tortillas are some of the best I've ever had.  Now while I rave about the food, I feel this restaurant needs some work on the service end and my worry is, as of late, the place is getting a little less clean than is used to be."}
{"text":"Being from Arizona it's hard to compare Mexican food in the Midwest. Decent prices, smaller portions, okay food."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. The bacon wrapped scallops with veggies and spicy mashed sweet potatoes...Yum! The 32oz pina colada margarita is a must when on a crappy blind date!"}
{"text":"Great drinks!!!! Wonderful place. The waitress are great and a great atmosphere. Hannah is awesome"}
{"text":"No good. Stopped in for drinks and snacks before the Springsteen concert this week. Service was awful. The hostess got our drinks. After 30 minutes a server Finally approached our table. The menu advertised a  taco Tuesday special.  So of course we were interested in this (just wanting something little to go with our drinks), and our server replied that they don't do taco Tuesday when there is a big event at the Q?!?!?  Um, your business is located on west 4th. Major venues are par for the course. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by during the NCAA wrestling championships and it was super busy. We got our drink orders and water and chips and salsa pretty quick considering. I ordered the shredded beef burrito which was alright, but others in our party ordered the fish taco and a shrimp taco and it was pretty damn good. Another plate we had was the carnitas and pickled veggies and it was a hit! The margaritas were good and the micheladas rivaled that of any I've had in SoCal!"}
{"text":"Ok, where do we start? Waitress did not bring drink to one of us The alcohol drinks did not contain alcohol, or very little... Had to ask for lemons 3 times before I received them for my water Once the lemons came, they were old, dark colored and clearly rotten or near rotten One of our friends ordered carnitas and it was beef jerky (See attached picture). To make things worse, this burrito was supposed sour cream, queso, etc. and had nothing besides rice, beans, and beef jerky  I had trouble to other times coming to this place in the past and because all the other restaurants had 1.5 hour waits, we decided to give this place another try - NOT WORTH IT!  This is a 1 star restaurant and only survives off of location."}
{"text":"This rating is more a 3.5 but that wasn't an option.  My party of 5 ate here as a pre concert meal before the Bruno Mars concert at the Q.  I was worried about what we would experience given the mixed reviews from different sites, but due to my last minute search on Open Table, it was the only 6-7 slot Ressie we could find in the Gateway area. We were pleasantly surprised.  My chicken chimichanga was HUGE!  Fresh chunks of grilled chicken with guacamole and other stuffings inside a perfectly crisped tortilla wrap.  Sides of black beans (my choice vs pintos) and rice as well as additional guacamole, sour cream and salsa was delicious and filling.  Others in my party ordered chicken or steak tacos and fajitas; they were all equally impressed with the freshness and quantity but the server did forget to bring one persons included sides.  My mom needs gluten free so after getting clarification on the sarnita ingredient in the veggie bowl, she ordered that (w/o the sarnitas).  She LOVED it- lots of fresh veggies including grilled zucchini. The temperature of the frozen margaritas was perfect!  Not so cold that a big sip gives you a brain freeze, but cold enough to be refreshing on a hot day.  The decor is really pretty.  We sat at a booth in the basement in a corner just behind the stairs and near a TV.  This was good bec/the restrooms were nearby on this level.  With all if the hard surfaces floor to ceiling, this is def a noisy experience. For those of us in the party who are on the height-challenged size, the table height in relation to the booth seating made us have to reach \"up\" a bit to reach our plates- def not normal seat to table height.  However we made the best of it and joked that perhaps nursing homes should try this height so the residents don't spill food in their laps as much.:)  The only drawbacks were the following : * Key West margarita frozen version really didn't have a kick which for the price of all the margaritas, you'd expect it would esp. In a tequilaria. It was good, but more in a slushy kind of way not a \"make me feel happy\" drink kind of way. I switched over to a regular style- something that began with a P- which while it had more of a kick still didn't really have enough \"kick\" to make me leave \"feelin' happy\" like I would after two margaritas at my regular Mexican joint that charges much less. *server spilled salsa on the pants of one of our party when bringing it to the table.  She was apologetic and brought a rag to clean it.  Not surprising this happened though since the salsa while good is on the more liquid consistency and bowl was over full. *chips- first batch texture seemed stale and chewy; second batch while def warm and crispy was VERY greasy. *womens' restroom- water was SCALDING hot (visible STEAM) and no way to adjust- lawsuit waiting to happen; overflowing wastebaskets w/hand towels everywhere; unusable handicap stall which clearly was a stop for someone who either had stomach flu or couldn't hold their tequila shot flight-GROSS! I did alert a downstairs server and a hostess about this so hopefully they got it cleaned up so later patrons didn't have to face this mess.  Overall, we were more satisfied than dissatisfied but will def try other W4th options before returning here unless in a bind for a Ressie and can't get in somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food, Deanna is the best! The chorizo is amazing. Drinks are good too! Great recommendations and energy!  Ask for her"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance from Zocalo and have tried to like this place again and again throughout the years.. with no success. The atmosphere makes me wish I liked the food.. which is a continuous disappointment. The margarita menu is enticing, but the drinks themselves are disappointing. I have ordered food myself numerous times, usually with a party of 4+.. and have never heard anyone give a compliment to their meal.  If you're looking for trendy/modern Mexican, it is well worth the 15 minute drive east to  Lopez in Cleveland Heights or 5 minutes west to Momocho in Ohio City. I love the concept of a cool, modern Mexican restaurant.. and wish I could find I good one on E.4th Street."}
{"text":"we have been here twice in the last month.  the first time the service was terrible but the food was great.  so great that i said just eat at the bar and you will be ok.  I should have took my own advice.  we were sat at 1:05 and ordered at approximately 1:10.  at 1:40 we had to ask for a manager because we had not received our food or drinks.  the manager was unappoligetic.  the only person that seemed to care was the bartender who didnt even wait on us.  The food this time was TERRIBLE.  some of the worst mexican i have ever had.  this is so disappointing because this place is so close to where i work.  needless to say i will never go back and i will make sure that the people i work with wont go either."}
{"text":"Pretty good margarita. Decent chips but dull salsa.  Weak pork enchilada and middling-at-best service (friendly but pokey and inaccurate).  I'd do 2.5 stars if it were an option."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great margaritas. The real success in Zocalo is their Taco Tuesday, which is only available in the bar area. It's street taco food from $1-$5. Can't go wrong with their fantastic margaritas! Try the guacamole."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years when visiting Cleveland and it's always a highlight. I'm baffled by the negative reviews of this place, I adore it. I've eaten here several times (only vegetarian items, natch) and the food we've ordered has been good, but the real reason to go is the table side preparation of fresh guacamole and awesome drinks. We typically just grab some bar seating, there isn't usually a wait for a high top table, and the service is usually on point. The interior is modern and funky, not to mention two levels so there's lots of seating. The location on 4th Street is perfect for people watching, both near the windows and inside the restaurant. The margaritas are tasty and huge and come in fun flavors such as Pomegrita, Prickly Pear, Blackberry Lime, even Mango Avocado. There are lots of frozen margaritas to choose from also. I usually stick with mango, but there's also strawberry, peach, banana, raspberry, coconut, etc.  I like this place. I've always had a good experience there and the prices are very reasonable. Next time I'm in Cleveland you can be sure I'll be there for some guac and a margarita or two."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst restaurants we have ever been to. We arrived with no wait. It took us 15 minutes to get water and another 45 to get our meals we ordered. The waitress only brought us food once we inquired as to where it was. When we called the manager over to discuss our room temperature food and our hour wait we were basically told it was normal to have to wait an hour for a single taco and there was nothing he could do for us. Skip this place, go to Barrio it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"I am surprise Zocalo is just a two star!  Okay to be fair I ordered the Mahi Mahi with Mango Tomatillo Salsa.  I know not very Mexican but it was very good!  I got a nice size piece of fish, seasonal vegetable and \"Yes\" Mexican rice.  I would definitely go back but beware the waiting staff is lacking!!!  If it was not for the waiters i would give it 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was after an Indians game.  Got seated fairly quickly and had a friendly server.  I ordered the Paella chef's special.  It was quite alright, nothing spectacular.  The empanadas were pretty good though for an appetizer. While eating i noticed the greeters going outside smoking and hanging out pretty much. Shooot I'd love a job where i could do that.    I went here a 2nd time and ordered their fish tacos and my brother got their steak off the chef's menu.  It was overcooked and really really bland. The tacos were blehhhh. I could have gotten better at taco bell to be honest.   We asked for hot sauce and the only hot sauce they had in this mexican restaurant was \"tabasco\" lol.  Our server disappeared and was hardly there.    Craving Mexican food? I'd recommend going across the street to the winking lizard LOL."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was spotty but they were busy. The problem: Flies and gnats. I'm talking a gross amount of gnats. We were seated downstairs in the back corner and there were gnats covering the wall. They weren't moving and it wasn't until after we ordered that we started noticing how many were flying around and then I asked my friend what the spots on the wall were. They seriously need to wipe the walls down or something. We spent the whole meal hovering over our plates and waving flying bugs away."}
{"text":"Lunch. Great Location we sat street side. The food was very bland.   I had the Goat Cheese Quisaddia with Black Beans.  Will try something else on East 4th St before coming back here."}
{"text":"How great was this place. They were getting ready to close up and we were exhausted. The gal said to absolutely take a seat, she had a bunch of side work. So we sat down at a clean table and ordered a Margarita for each of us. Then when she said it was too late to eat but when asked for chips and salsa she delivered! After sitting at the convention all night and not eating real food that was a godsend. Not to mention the margaritas were gigantic! I recommend this place for sure! Sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, but had a few drinks. The spot was very lively and fun. Will come back and test the food next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Though AGM Heather did everything possible to right our disastrous dinner, this place still gets one star. Had drinks spilled on us. Twice. Not just a drip - I'm talking an entire frozen margarita dumped on us. Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Oh this is the worst kind of worst. A menu that overpromises and delivers yesterday's Taco Bell.   Actually, that's not fair to Taco Bell. This is a tourist trap, end of story.  We didn't realize Greenhouse Tavern wasn't open for lunch on weekends, and we were pushing a toddler around in the freezing rain in a stroller, so we just went in the first place we saw open. The menu looked GREAT. We started with a trio of black bean and corn salsa, queso chorizo and goat cheese and poblano guac. The chips were stale and cold, the \"queso\" was movie theater nacho cheese w/ a chunk of sausage on top, the salsa was dry and old and the guac was just okay. The papas fritas with cilantro oil, queso fresco sounded fantastic... and were disgusting, limp, undercooked and flavorless. My steak and goat cheese taco was fine, the carnitas taco gave me a mouthful of grease that took away my appetite completely. My husband's chimichanga was edible. The rice? Zatarain's dirty rice straight out of the box. Refried beans were poured straight from a Sam's Club can, I swear it.   Service was fine, but I left incredibly pissed off that I spent $50 on barely edible food. Can't speak to drinks because we stuck with diet coke."}
{"text":"If the next version of the show Survivor featured restaurants on 4th street, Zocalo would be the first to be voted off.  Come to think of it, I've never heard anything good about Zocalo from my friends.  On top of that, check out the Yelp Rating distribution.  My own experiences in the past have been marginal at best.  But I live across the street and saw they had a Groupon out, so I bought it and thought I would give them another shot.  Par for the Mexican course, your adventure begins with chips and salsa. While they do a great job with the salsa and the chips are tasty, I felt this was the highlight of the meal.   The food was 'eh'. We went on Taco night and the tortilla was ripped and tasted a bit stale.  Prices are reasonable for what you get; it's as cheap as you'll find on East 4th street. Serving sizes are nothing special.  The tequila selection is great. The draft list is mostly Mexican brews.    Service wasn't shabby - maybe that was because we were the only people in the restaurant though.    Zocalo - Adapt the menu and the food quality or you'll be voted off the 4th street island."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another try after my bad experience this summer. Terrible idea! Bought the Groupon, went for lunch on a rainy, cold Wednesday. No one was there, and I should have known why.   Drinks took long to come, waitress forgot our appetizer...when our food finally did come, it didn't even look good. Greasy, luke warm, I barely ate the tamale. Not to mention our waitress forgot our silverware so when I grabbed the bartender to ask him for it, he laughed at our waitress, there wasn't anything funny about that...  It's not like it was crowded or busy, so I don't know what the issues were about. I don't know how this place makes it on E4th either.   Only thing this place has going for it is their salsa.   Sorry Zocalo, I will not be going back, twice was enough for me"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food. Chicken tacos were incredibly soft and flavorful, beans were excellent. Nice decor, good service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place only gets one star for the enthusiastic server.  Food's awful; prices high; drinks weak or bad.  Great for those who want to blow their money on a high priced, \"creative' bar.   Don't bother... PLEASE!    Literally ended up getting sick from the poorly prepared food.  How do I know... because I literally got sick 10 minutes after I left the restaurant.  PLEASE... DON'T GO!  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came to Zócalo Tequilería for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Located in the East fourth area of downtown Cleveland, my mom and I picked Zócalo Tequilería on a whim. The place was pretty crowded for a Friday at lunch but it was mostly downtown Cleveland office workers. Our waitress was friendly enough and fairly attentive.  The complementary chips and salsa were standard. The chips had a nice crunch but the salsa was slightly sweet and I wasn't a big fan of it. For my meal, I ordered one house street taco with carnitas and one shrimp Diablo street taco. The tacos were larger than your average street taco so I'm glad I only ordered two. The carnitas wasn't the typical shredded pork that I'm used to but it still had a nice flavor. The shrimp Diablo taco was tasty with the chipotle mayo on top.   My mom ordered some massive burger in a taco concoction but she absolutely loved it. All in all, not a bad spot to grab average Mexican food with your friends."}
{"text":"Margarita was very lime juice tasting manager w as very hick to help resolve the situation but the 2nd 1 was still lime juicy but not as much"}
{"text":"I first went here for lunch and was surprised by how large a crowd they had for the lunch hour (with so many other places nearby). Given the crowd, my husband and I stopped in to see what this place was all about.   The hostess was cold and standoffish. We asked if a table was available on the patio and she gave us a dirty look and told us she'd have to go check. She came back, said no and hastily led us to a table inside at the bar. The tables in the bar area are extremely small and wobbly. As a result, the waiter brought our drinks and as soon as he set them on the table, the table leaned and the drinks spilled all over us and the table. The waiter moved us to another small, wobbly bar table. The same thing happened a second time! Finally, he gave us a sturdier table further away from the bar.   The menu is decent and pretty large, although my husband strongly disliked the fajitas. Our waiter was very friendly and made the experience much better. The atmosphere inside is pretty decent, as well (except for the small, wobbling bar tables). All in all, I'd much rather go to Si Senor, the best Mexican restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Are all the negative reviews a planned sabotage? I was in town for the Rock N Roll Museum and needed a taco fix. It was Taco Tuesday and happy hour at Zocalo and it was a lot of fun. The neighborhood of Fourth Street is real nice and the outside seating at Zocalo adds to the enjoyment. The tacos range from $1-$4 depending on what you get and half off margaritas during half hour are worth the price. My meal was pretty cheap and I don't think i would pay more than what I did for this food. As an Americanized Mexican cuisine it was good, the open faced tacos and selected ingredients bring rather close to the authentic feel. The food was moist and flavorful, the corn tortillas were warm and soft, however the chips were on the greasy side and the salsa was a bit bland with out adequate spice.   I need to break down my review a bit:  Food = 3 stars, Environment = 4 Stars, Drinks = 3.5 Stars  If i had to return to Zocalo i would do so on the same day of the week and same time. I am unsure if the place is worth the real price of the drinks (10 bucks for a margarita) and the food."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago with friends.   The food wasn't anything special. The restaurant itself was a bit on the messy side and extremely crowded. We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table.  A few friends were in from out of town and wanted to drink before we saw a show.  I wasn't really impressed with the food selection.  I would have been if they had the shark tacos.  Anyway, I ordered a few tacos. They came out cold and the tortilla wasn't warm, it was actually a bit on the stail side. I had to pay for some sour cream.  The drinks were tasty, a little over priced and not really that strong. I don't think we'll come back."}
{"text":"I've been to Zocalo twice and was completely underwhelmed on both visits.  I have tried the fajitas and the quesadilla and both were OK.  The food doesn't have a lot of flavor or pizazz.    The wait staff is friendly and the fresh chips and salsa are good, but overall I've experienced much better."}
{"text":"I am not sure why the reviews are so low. My fiancé and I came here last night for dinner and it was great! We ate out on the patio, and the atmosphere was really nice. The chips and salsa are delicious, the salsa had just the right amount of kick.   My fiancé had a great steak enchilada, and the sauce was really quite good. I ate some of his and it was a great flavor, and had some nice heat.  He also got the papas fritas, which were good, but I thought they lacked a little flavor.   My veggies taco was okay, I probably would not get it again.  My Mojito was really delicious. It tasted so fresh and delightful :)"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this one measly star is cause this place has a nice ambience and good location.  The food is absolutely pathetic. They can't even make salsa. I ordered the shark fajitas and completely let down. They said they did not have shark and hadn't updated the menu.  Tacos are crap as well. This place has a lot of potential with location and ambience.  It needs help with the kitchen. Avoid until you know they have made changes to the food."}
{"text":"Okay, so I don't know if this means anything to any of you, but I was born and raised in Arizona where I grew up eating amazing Mexican food in the cities and at friends' homes. Zocalo is special for Cleveland, and to me, very good. It is not authentic Mexican because it has an additional exotic taste to it, that I can't put my finger on. I ordered the combination beef enchilada and chili relleno. The enchilada was tasty with it's great sauce and cheese(s). The beef was tender and traditionally stewed and shredded. The finishing touch was the diced chives that were sprinkled on top. The relleno was wonderful as it was stuffed with a great selection of grilled veggies such as: squash, zucchini, red peppers, etc. My friend ordered the steak with a terrific spread of grilled veggies. The only thing that I did not like was the black beans as a side dish: very bland. I can't wait to go back and taste the burrito everyone is raving about. We happened to have a sweetheart of a server too."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a review for a place that was truly disappointing. It was my first time to downtown Cleveland and my girlfriend and friends wanted to have a great meal before going to improv. We walked around the downtown area to find a restaurant that was good along with a menu that was allergy friendly. The food was not bad by any means (Taco Bell would been about the same though), but the server was hands down the worst in my entire life. Our friend  who has an allergy problem asked if she could have a frozen margarita with only lime our server Sean told her he was \"confused\" as to why she would say she is allergic to fruit...nonetheless Sean continued to disappoint with his attitude by then continuing on to give a snarky remark about how the tacos are already on a soft tortilla. The food was average, nothing to boast about but the service is what will keep us far away from Zocalo. Spend your money else where!"}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place is in business. The drinks were the only thing that was good and most of us drank more water than alcohol. The food is the worst tasting Mexican we've ever had. It's not even Mexican food. Just cause it says burrito on the menu doesn't make it Mexican. We didn't eat the appetizers or our meals because they were terrible. We spent lots of money and the food wasn't edible. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"After a long absence, I was looking forward to returning to Zocalo.  A quick review of the online menu did indicate that some changes had been made since my last visit, but I remained optimistic.  For a Saturday mid-afternoon visit, the place was lively, perhaps as a result of a coinciding Indians home game, but we were seated promptly.   Our server took my wife's drink order in a timely manner, but I wanted to review the tequila selections, and she subsequently returned with my wife's wine and the tequila list.  I remember from prior visits that tequila flights were accompanied by an optional sangrita (a lovely chili/citrus/tomato concoction) so I made sure to request the sangrita when I ordered a \"Best in Show\" tequila flight.  The server also took our appetizer and entrée orders (queso and enchiladas) when I ordered my flight.   As we were waiting for my drink, we looked around at the other patrons happily snacking on chips and salsa while they reviewed the menu, and we noticed that we had arrived, placed 2 drink orders, appetizer order and entrée orders and had our menus collected and we still did not have chips.   My flight arrived shortly thereafter with the sangrita and a cucumber/pineapple (?) drink in shot glasses, along with a full-sized burgundy colored drink with an orange slice garnish.  The server explained that this is how a flight is presented.   Our queso was delivered next by another server, and we were still without the requisite chips to eat it, so we asked him to supply some for us.  We watched the queso cool for another four minutes before our chips finally arrived.   I was quite enjoying my tequila, and after about 3 sips of the burgundy drink, I realized what had happened; The server had mistaken my request for SANGRITA as a request for SANGRIA, but I was thirsty and drank it anyway, though it would not have been my first choice for an $8 drink.   The enchiladas arrived with no accompaniment and a scant amount of sauce that was hardly visible, filled only with a choice of protein (mine was mushroom), no cheese inside.  Hardly living up to its menu description as a \"Full Plate\" these three meager tortillas were difficult to cut with a fork (the only utensil provided, and presented in a small bag??).  In addition to the relatively small portion and the difficulty in dividing it, the flavor was rather bland, and a good portion of flavorful enchilada sauce could have made a great improvement. There are certain expectations that one has regarding an upscale Mexican restaurant, as opposed to a local strip-mall Tex-Mex place.  Zocalo succeeded in meeting two of these expectations (High prices and a great tequila list).  The quality of food and attentiveness of the servers paled in comparison to our local and beloved Si Senor, where a similar order would be considerable less expensive, and accompanied by rice, beans, and plenty of flavorful sauce."}
{"text":"In my opinion, they are lucky they have a good location because I don't know how else they'd get some customers with the poor mexican food they serve. I ordered the seafood paella and it was so bad I couldn't even finish it despite not being completely full yet. The sauce in the rice tasted gritty and the shrimp was hard and rubbery. You could tell that it's not fresh. I couldn't see/taste any other seafood in the dish. I don't see how they can price it at \"market price\" when there's essentially no seafood in there. The server was friendly and when she messed up my colleague's pitcher of margarita (they ordered on the rocks but she made it frozen), she gave a pitcher to us for free. They said the drinks were good but the food was not so great.   The only good part about the whole meal was it was free since my company reimburse us for food when traveling. I wish we went to Lola across the street instead since it got such great reviews."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland with a friend for a baseball game, and we pulled out our handy dandy Yelp app to find the best eats nearby. Zocalo was recommended to me before we arrived in Cleveland, so I already had a hunch that we would be eating here.  The first thing we were concerned about was tequila: how can we can the most possible asap. Zocalo offers pitchers of Margaritas in all different flavors, ranging from 28$ to 60$ depending on the brand of tequila, flavor etc. We went with a frozen pitcher, and our waiter who was super cool let us mix the mango and strawberry flavors together. It was SO good, arguably the best frozen marg I've ever had.   They give you complimentary chips and salsa, which were really good. The salsa didn't have too much cilantro in it, which I appreciate. The waiter also recommended the queso (not telling us it was another 4$) and it was SO GOOD. It was a white queso, really thick and creamy. I got the steak quesadilla as an entrée and was pleased.   Again, our waiter rocked. He was really helpful with the menu and made conversation with us about the sporting events we were seeing and about our hometown. Definitely a must-stop if you love tequila like we do!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Mexican food on 6 continents.  Only Zocala can mess up an order of Fajitas.  Chicken served cold on a mildly hot cast iron plate by a server who seemed to not understand this is a problem."}
{"text":"Best thing about my visit here was the pitcher of Sangria for $24.00. Good stuff. We ordered two before the Yankees v Indians game.   Otherwise, the food was bland, and the portions small, for this so called Mexi-Cali Fusion restaurant"}
{"text":"Came down 4th street before a concert at the Q. Every restaurant was packed! But we were able to snag a table in the bar area.   Drinks were standard but the food was excellent. (Hence the 4 out of 5 stars) My boyfriend had a chicken burrito - it was quite large but perfect before a night of drinking and was full of very clean flavors. I had the tostada - a large pile of fresh lettuces on top of a crispy tortilla. So inspiring! Can't wait to recreate something like this at home.    A less greasy version of classic Mexican food - light and fresh, not heavy and full of lard. Call it fresh Mexican fusion"}
{"text":"We used to come to this place all the time, they basically got rid of everything we liked about the place and raised the prices. I never liked the food here anyway, the are plenty of other restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"Went to Zocalo ordered some tacos and drinks. There was a hair in my tacos told the waitress and she apologized.  Waitress said the manager would not charge me for THAT taco!  The manager couldn't say no charge at all for the whole dinner?  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Plenty of Mexican restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised to see how low this place is rated on Yelp.  The food was really good.  I had some incredibly delicious fish tacos here.  The sauce on it was just perfect and they were very flavorful and satisfying.  Maybe the other low reviews are based on service, which was not good.  It felt like we were an afterthought during a busy lunch service and we had to flag her down for the check at the end."}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner, this place was perfect for a dinner and pre-game right before the Cavs game!! I loved the bacon and mango guacamole to start, and the margaritas at happy hour are $5 and taste great! I ordered the chicken salad taco which was good- savory with sweet elements. I also ordered the papas fritas chorizo taco. It tasted great but was missing greens, it was just meat cheese and potatoes. Of course the best part for me was the vast selection of tequilas! A quick shot before the game and you're great! You can choose from the house $6 brands up to the $250 anniversary José... I stayed on the cheaper side though with Patron Silver and got their house made Sangrita mix to chase- Delish!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and brother-in-law late one summer night. Place was packed so figured it's gonna be good. Right? Wrong.  Food was bland... I LOVE Mexican food and was hoping to get my craving fix, but that didn't happen. There just wasn't a lot of spices cooked into the food. I can make better Mexican at home. If you HAVE to come here because someone is forcing you, I'd say get the quesadilla. It was the only thing ordered that night that tasted remotely good. My husband got tacos that were bland and my BIL and I got the nachos to share, also bland. Not to mention, they didn't have a lot of meat on them!! We were digging through the chips as if we're looking for a lost treasure.   I had a margarita but honestly can't remember if I enjoyed it. Maybe that's telling something."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped here for dinner and really enjoyed what we had! We took advantage of the queso and guac being cheap. Tried the cucumber pepper margarita and was very impressed! The tacos were delicious and I appreciate that they were al carte!"}
{"text":"Cool place, cool location but the mgmt needs to be more responsive to customer needs. When a simple request is made to substitute flour tortilla for corn tortilla, there should be automatic accommodation. Otherwise the meal was good. Had a chorizo burrito bowl."}
{"text":"I went there last sunday with a couple of friends ant we sat at the bar. The bartender kevin was really knowledgable and very nice the drinks were superb and the carnitas tacos were very tasteful and filling. The ambience was pleasant and overall it was a nice experience.  I will be back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth going to not just for the food but the night life atmosphere of East 4th street. I would try any restaurant in this alley way. I went with Zocalo Tequileria for their affordable menu. The food was very good."}
{"text":"Don't understand the bad reviews. Nice place, quick food, easy drinks. We had some vegetarian tacos and they were fantastic. Keven, our bartender, was fun and attentive to us, and it being our first time in the city gave us some recommendations of where else to visit while we're in town."}
{"text":"This place sucked.  Chips were loaded with oil, margaritas tasted like sour mix minus the tequila.  Food was total garbage, I was questioning the content of my enchiladas...   Will never go back."}
{"text":"I was in town for the marathon this past weekend and following the race needed to get some \"real\" food before heading out to the airport to fly home.    I was hoping to go back to the Irish pub across the street, where I had eaten lunch the previous afternoon and gotten great service (despite the fact that I had gotten caught in the rain on the way there and looked like hell) -- but, unfortunately, they did not open until 3 pm on Sunday.  So, since Zocalo's was open, and I like Mexican food, I thought I would give it a try.  Now granted, after finishing a marathon and still wearing my gear, I was not at my most attractive, but I think it was an improvement over my \"drowned rat\" look the day before.  But when I walked in, even though there was plenty of room to be seated in the main restaurant, I was told I could sit in the bar.  Well, after hours of running, I didn't relish the idea of balancing myself on a barstool to eat lunch, but luckily there was 1 booth available in the bar.  It took quite awhile for the server to stop by.  He took my drink order, and while I was waiting the host came over to see whether I had been helped yet.  I told him the server was getting my drink, but I still needed to see a menu.  He gave me one, and when the waiter returned I decided to order carnitas.  The beer (Dos Equis) was fine, but at $4.75 for a 16-ouncer, I felt the Murphys Amber I'd had the previous day at the pub across the street (for $6.00) was a better value.    The chips were good/warm, and the salsa wasn't bad.  Although I had ordered refried beans with my meal, I received black beans.  The carnitas were good and came with 2 sauces.  The habanero sauce was OK.  I didn't care for the other one -- I can't even tell you what it was called or what may have been in it, I just didn't like it.  Shortly after I started eating my meal, a party of 4 was seated outside on the patio.  The weather that afternoon was sunny but very cool and windy.  After seating that party, the waitress decided it was necessary to open the entire patio doorway.  This caused a backlash among the other 4 parties that were seated indoors near the doorway, as the air coming in from the doorway was freezing.  One guy at a table across from me jokingly complained that he had planned to have 12 more beers, but not now!  In spite of eveyone's complaints, the door remained open.    My overall impression:  The food isn't bad, but is more trendy than authentic, and seems a bit pricey.  The service is not so good -- I felt very unwelcome.  Initially, I thought I was feeling insecure because of how I looked, but after the patio door incident, I have concluded that the folks who work here don't particularly care whether you like their service or not.  I wish I had waited until 3 pm for the other restaurant to open.  I'm pretty sure it would have been worth the wait."}
{"text":"Dined at Zocalo on Saturday, August  4th.  We were staying at a nearby hotel and the concierge attempted to make a reservation for us but was told they did not take reservations on the weekend. Through Yelp we noticed that we had the option to make a reservation via Open Table so we did and it was confirmed.  Arrived at Zocalo promptly at 7:00 p.m. and were immediately seated and served chips, salsa and water.  Salsa was not to my liking, it was a chunky fresh salsa, I prefer a more blended salsa with some cilantro in it. Chips were okay, nothing special, definitely not made in-house or served warm.  Margarita menu was good, lots of variety.  Didn't really pay much attention to the tequila section but it appeared they offered a lot of different tequilas. Drinks were okay, I have had tarter and stronger margaritas, but it was certainly acceptable.  The BEST part of our meal was the guacamole sampler that we ordered! The original gauc is excellent and then they offer some interesting and tasty guac variations.  We tried the tomatillo and bacon variety and the roasted pumpkin seed, they were both great!  For dinner I ordered the taco combo plate. I got one pork taco and one beef. They were both good, the pork was a little watery which deconstructed the corn tortilla a bit.  I had a side of refried beans, they were actually quite good. My dinner companion had   the shrimp and chicken fajitas, reported they were good. Not the best, not the worst, solidly okay.  The atmosphere was pleasant. Around 8:30 a live band started playing in the bar area, it was a nice night so the front of the place was opened to the street.  Service was good, waitress was friendly.  Would I go back?  Maybe. But there are other places in the area I would like to try first."}
{"text":"Not that bad as other reviews are making it seem. We tried some of the unique tacos on the menu and they were delicious. Tacos are a little smaller, but they're still flavorful. Great location if you want to eat outside and view East 4th."}
{"text":"TIP: avoid anything that might have \"sauteed\" veg. it's mushy, flavorless, frozen after cooking, then cooked again.  # everything seems to be a hot mess. # kitchen loves to zig zag all dishes with this watery sour creamy \"aioli\"  # corn chips were not crispy, some were wet and soggy # salsa was watery and not fresh. ugh.  * great happy hour, nice selection of margaritas and tequilas.  What can I say, THIS IS OHIO. No good tex-mex to be had here."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at the bar on a Friday afternoon.  Food was good (upscale Mexican cuisine), cocktails were great (multiple margarita and mojito options), service was good.  Facility is large and was empty at the time, but was nice.  Outdoor seating was popular."}
{"text":"I went here with folks for work for a celebratory lunch. We got seated in the basement, which was a really awkward place. Chips - not good. Food - a step above Chili's. Overall I just wasn't impressed. And shouldn't they have some special selections in the Tequila department? Now... This was a couple years ago so perhaps they've gotten better. But I'd rather go to Luchitas where the service is more friendly, the food is solid (it's Mexican for goodness sakes) and the prices are far better."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review but the food here is awful.  If you are looking for food which tastes good go elsewhere.  We ordered faux (bland), fajitas (bland), tacos (bad), even the tortillas were served cold as if they just took them out of the bag.  The cilantro fries were ok.  I'd leave zero stars if it wasn't for the server who was nice."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has 2 stars!  I came in on a Sunday right after the rush from a Kevin Hart show and the bar staff could not have been better. He introduced himself, quickly took my order and recommended tequila to try.  The burrito bowl I got was awesome and the salsa was great.   Definitely try this spot."}
{"text":"Only drank here. Their margaritas were just okay. Super pricy and we didn't eat there since the food was expensive for Mexican food. Salsa was sub par too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. After the first time I said never again but friends wanted to come to celebrate a birthday. The food again was nasty and bland, with a weird combination of ingredients. They try hard to be fancy - Mexican food doesn't need to be fancy! Just delicious, and that's where this place fails. Super overpriced and I've hard better margaritas at a hole in the wall Mexican place. Skip it!! Try Barrio or even Cozumel if you're in Ohio. A waste of time, money, and space on awesome east 4th street!!"}
{"text":"Zoca No!  It's true that I have had it up to here with Mexican food, but I cannot tolerate overpriced Mexican slop posing as trendy food. This joint is visually arresting enough to think that something might be up. No.   Don't go unless you're already drunk and she's still begging you to buy her a mojito."}
{"text":"Sporting delicious, affordable Mexican food (with more than an adequate amount of vegetarian items), and a fabulous décor, Zocalo is perfect for happy hour or for a nice dinner out with a partner. Comparisons to Barrio are inevitable, but Zocalo sets itself apart by providing a much more comprehensive menu, and a classier vibe. Their tequila list also includes some massively expensive top, top, top shelf bottles to entice the connoisseur. While the tortilla chips could have been a little crispier, the food was well spiced and the guac was killer-good. The portion size is also pretty generous given the price. Worth a look for anyone searching for an alternative to the jaw-dropping wait at Barrio down the block."}
{"text":"Save your money....not worth it. I didn't think table side quac could be destroyed but they happened to do it. I have never had dry carnitas"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day. I was excited because well, I love tacos! And a guy from work was bragging about the quesadilla he had from here. So we walked here and got seated in a booth for two, there were 3 of us so we were all bumping elbows the entire time. The place was empty because it was raining. Like 5 other tables being used. I ordered 3 tacos, 2 beef one chicken and the chips and salsa. Chips and salsa were amazing! I'm talking amazing! But that was the only thing pleasant about this trip. My tacos came out and they were wrong. I ordered no sour cream, they came with sour cream. Plus they gave me 3 beef. I asked the girl if it was all beef and she goes \"oh no, it's the seasoning.\" Um chicken is white, not dark like beef.\" So she rolled her eyes and brought me out another one. This one was actually chicken. I didn't care much for the seasoning on these tacos. However the beef was way better than the chicken. I loved the toppings that were on it. My friends knowing I wasn't happy, or full, gave me some of their quesadilla. Oh my! That was awesome!! They were perfect, not dry just awesome. Then came time for our bill. The girl mixed up my bill with my friend. At that point I was just ticked, so she gave me the cash difference for hers and called it a day so we could get out of there. I was disappointed. The only saving grace for this visit was the quesadilla and the chips and salsa.   A tip, if your fluffy and one of your friends is as well, ask for a bigger table so your not squished in a smaller one. They are fluffy people friendly, as long as your seated properly for the right amount of people.   The place was clean, tables not sticky and chairs were cleaned and wiped down properly."}
{"text":"Great location, homemade tableside guac and atmosphere. I've been several times and never really had an outstanding entree though (fish tacos, chicken burrito) so I prefer to visit for drinks and chips & dip."}
{"text":"There is tons of seating here, good drinks, and interesting takes on Mexican classics. The food tends to be a little on the bland side, but my biggest complaint is the service. It was pretty slow and seemed to be understaffed. As for location, East 4th is a lively area and lots of fun to be around in the evening."}
{"text":"I'm not big on Mexican food because it always makes me wonder how it comes out so fast. This place was absolutely delicious and their salsa is the best I've ever had in any Mexican restaurant. The food tasted fresh and did not come out right away like other Mexican joints. If going on a weekend plan to have to wait a little bit. And if you like Mexican its definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"If you're looking for homemade type of sweeter side tequila mixed drinks then this is your place. Service was good, light crowd after a Cavs game. I had the fish taco and the tortilla was store bought which was disappointing. The fish was tasty though, overpriced at $5 for what you get. The margarita was tasty but sweet and overpriced. It seemed like all of the mixed tequila drinks were sweet at least that was the appearance from the menu. This is not a cocktail lounge. I would revisit if wanted something really casual, beer selection wasn't as extensive as other bar-restaurants in the area. This area could really benefit from a well-run, well-stocked Mexican Restaurant, it would bring another aspect of diversity to the area which is growing."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by before an Indians game because they seemed to have decent  happy hour selections ($5 Margaritas & $5 Apps). While we were waiting to be seated (no one in front of us) a guy told us he'd be with us in a minute.  Then proceeded to do other tasks and didn't say anything when another worker asked if they could help.  If you were busy the other worker could have helped us! Then in our first sip of our $5 margaritas we got a mouthful of salt.  Apparently when they put it on the rim of the glass it also got into the glass and settled at the bottom-yuck! The chips and salsa were so-so. But the app we ordered was queso fundido-which is my fave at other restaurants but this was just disgusting & super greasy. We left after that not wanting to spend one more dime in this cheap place.  The only nice part was our waitress.  We will never go back and make sure no one else we knows makes the same mistake we did!"}
{"text":"Yeeeah. Not often that I break out a one star review, and certainly not often I do it for a local place, but Zocalo is a scourge on the culinary scene of Cleveland, and it's unfortunately in a terribly prominent location. I feel sad whenever I see it full because it is not a good place by any measure. Whether you like authentic Mexican or cheese-laden fajita-driven faux Americanized Mexican, Zocalo can disappoint you. Good tequila selection. Decent happy hour drink prices. Abominable food."}
{"text":"Oh zocalo-no! Located in the very trendy and high-caliber downtown E.4th street spot, Zocalo Mexican Grill & Tequilera is a tortilla chip that has dropped its salsa. You'll find it's hideaway entrance as something of which you should be weary.  Once you make it through that alley, be prepared for some tight spots. Upon my arrival I was very pleased with the decor inside. The other reviews are right in telling you that the atmosphere, the permanent fixtures, make for a nice decor. But that's not the only reason you're there, it's also about the food.  We settled on a high-top table that sat around the perimeter of the staircase which led to the bottom part of the restaurant. I admit, this was a nice concept, a dual-story joint. The downside of this was seeing the service eek past me with their trays of food and drink, clearly barely avoided these high-top tables. I understand it's about turning a profit, but why at the expense of a comfortable service?  The enchiladas were decently thrown together, and this burrito bowl I had left much to be desired. The vegetables were not near tender and the entire dish tasted undercooked and as if it was sitting somewhere for a while.  The service, like the food, was lukewarm at best. The waitress gave half-hearted attention and failed to keep the meal moving. Chips and salsa were okay but once you've got the entree, you've got have some sense to make room on a small table. At one point, I noted an employee taking a break with a beer in the service area. I don't care if you need something to take the edge off, but you can't let it interfere with service.  At the end of the evening, there was a table nearby that clearly had many margaritas (or tequila!) and I saw a decoration that summed Zocalo up for me. It was a small fake cauldron blowing an orange paper flame; Zocalo, giving you the appearance of an sizzling experience with no heat, just show."}
{"text":"Food was pretty much typical of a decent Mexican restaurant.  HOWEVER.... Let's talk tequila!!!  Phenomenal selection with all the high end you could possibly ever want.  We stayed downtown, so we tried all them all  since we didn't have to drive.  Very cool vibe makes this a nice place to eat, drink and relax with that special someone."}
{"text":"I have to give Zocalo 4 stars because it is a lot better than everyones reviews say they are.  Or at least it was for the burrito I ordered.  The rice and beans that came with my burrito were very very good.  Probably some of the best rice I have had in a mexican restaurant.  The rice was well seasoned and had tons of crazy flavor.  The beans were about average.  I ordered the Burrito Con Carne.  It was in a fresh and flakey tortilla.  The steak was tender and tasty.  It had all sorts of good crap in it.  Every bite was so freaking good.  Here is the description off the menu - Flat iron steak asada, mexican rice, salsa fresca and our specialty cheese blend, stuffed into a large flour tortilla and topped with salsa fresca, crema fresca and fresh guacamole  The chips and salsa were fantastic and different from most Mexican restaurants.  The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of Mexican music for me to jam out to.  I mean some times a white guy just wants to throw on a sombrero and salsa dance on the bar.  A girl can dream right?  No? ok."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We went on a Tuesday, anticipating their Taco Tuesday specials. They sat us in the back of the restaurant, and it wasn't until we ordered food that we found out you can only get the special tacos and half off margeritas in the bar.  I wish they had asked  before they sat us. I ordered a steak nacho to share - it was delicious!  Should have stuck with that. My entree was the Enchilada Tinga Poblano.  The carnitas was dry and not very flavorful. Charro beans were nothing special.   Others ordered various ala cart items.  No one was impressed. One saving grace - the rice was terrific!   So, I can recommend the steak nachos and the rice."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Mexican food place in Cleveland, there are too many other good places to eat in Cleveland to bother with this place"}
{"text":"One star is a stretch! Ate dinner paid and the bill was 37.90 but my alert on my phone came up 45.90! I inquired with the server and she acted dumbfounded and came back and gave me \"this is standard on debit cards in case you do not leave a tip\"   I said not that the service was bad but if it were Zocallo decides what is appropriate tip without the guests permission!   Unreal!   Not to mention the table we sat at was near where the bus boy emptied all the dishes which if it were in any city other than Cleveland their would be a food violation for sanitary violations .... Food remnants on the ground!   This place is run poorly and the way they run the bill for their clients is suspect!   Beware!"}
{"text":"We were really excited about trying this place but what a letdown! The waiter couldn't handle it when my brother-in-law and I switched seats. He all but berated us for it when it came time to give us our checks. My husband had to explain to him which seat number to put on which check.  My other brother-in-law's Agave nectar chicken was very good and the vegetables that came with were tasty and fresh as well. My chile relleno was very bland. I've had better at Jalapeno Loco and it was cheaper too. My husband ate one triangle of his quesadilla and threw the rest away. The beans that came as sides tasted like they were dumped onto our plates straight out of the can. Someone at our table got the grande burrito which he really liked. It was just too hit or miss and the wait staff doesn't seem to be very well trained.  I might come back for margaritas if we were already on East 4th. I wouldn't ever come out here again just to go to Zocalo."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on  Friday evening without reservations, were seated promptly and waited on quickly.  This place deserves much better than 2 stars.  I did not find the food overly spicy at all, just flavorful like Mexican food should be.  Had sweet corn mole enchiladas and crab crusted mahi mahi.  Yummy all around.  Margaritas seemed authentic and not Americanized sweet.  Price was super reasonable for the quality.  They have managed to capture an authentic Mexican  restaurant without simply duplicating the menu selections, chips, salsa and margarita you have elsewhere.  Sure, you can get your American chimichanga here if you wish but there is so much better and authentic to choose from."}
{"text":"Food here is just ok... not really worth the price. Margarita's are pretty decent. On Taco Tuesdays they have a special taco menu which is pretty cool but be careful which ones/ how many your order as only one of the tacos is actually $1. Other than that this is one of the more affordable restaurant options on E 4th St and I feel like pretty much everyone can find something they'll eat with Mexican food."}
{"text":"I did not eat anything while here and a quick look over the reviews makes me glad I didn't lol.  We were going to swing by Lola's then hang out afterwards to drink, but we totally forgot about the Pens playoff game. Since Lola's doesn't have TVs, we hit bar after bar trying to find the game until we finally saw it playing in Zocalo. Actually, I should say that we knew the game was playing here from the beginning, but my boyfriend wasn't \"eager\" to go inside (he's been before ... bad experience, maybe?).  We managed to get two seats at the bar, which was rather lucky because the place was packed! There was some guy playing acoustic covers along with all the other sports playoff games going on. We ended up having way too much tequila (I don't know how we made it to dinner), majority of which was free since the male bartender was a little ... \"friendly.\" hehe didn't make my bf happy, but it's free alcohol, baby!?!  I can't remember if the Pens won or not this particular night, but I had a good time so there."}
{"text":"I ordered take out. 2 carnetas tacos , refried beans, rice and white cheese. The carnitas where burnt and almost unrecognizable. Rice was undercooked and had a very strange smell. The refried beans where not seasoned and the cheese was not even enough for one person.  I called 2 times and was assured that a GM would get back to me. The first time I spoke with a manager who was very apologetic, offered 2 options, a gift certificate (which I politely declined) and my money back. I had to throw the entire meal out so that was the better option for me. When I didn't hear from the GM I called again and both the manager and general manner where unavailable. I left another message. When I didn't hear from them I wrote a review on their Facebook page about my experience. Still haven't heard from anyone.  The worst part I ordered through Deliver Me Food so I paid extra to have it delivered only to be highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Note to the manager who was working on the evening of March 15:  When I complain about a disappointing entree which was very misleadingly described on the menu and your response is a lame shrug and a feeble, \"sorry,\" please understand that you are losing me as a customer.  I ordered the Carne Guisada, which was described as a \"Mexican potroast cooked with root vegetables.\"  What I got was a big bowl of stew that was mostly rice, potatoes and a few chunks of tasteless beef.  To be completely fair, I looked up \"carne guisada\" and it does seem to be known as a stew, but the menu never said stew and never said rice.  I'm on a low carb diet and so all I could do was pick at the tiny pieces of meat, which meant I was done with my dinner in less than five minutes.  Honestly, rice AND potatoes in the same dish?  A dish that's called \"carne\" anything?  It's a shame, Mr. Manager, because I'm here in Cleveland for three weeks, I love Mexican food and I'm my hotel is right around the corner from your restaurant.  You made absolutely no effort to have me leave your restaurant happy."}
{"text":"I can't begin to explain how horrible our experience was with this company! I booked a surprise 65th birthday dinner for my husband for 20 people, and it was a DISASTER! From refusing to return phone calls to the fact that our table was nowhere near ready when my guests arrived to decorate and await the \"surprise\" greeting, to awful service and extremely bland mediocre food, the entire night was a disappointment. When I walked in with my husband, instead of going to a table filled with his friends and family, we were thrown into a crowded bar area where he accidentally encountered the people who were supposed to be at our party. When we did finally get our table, it was partially in the entrance to the kitchen, and was extremely loud. There was only 1 server assigned for 20 people. While I had called ahead to arrange for a couple of severe food allergies, and was assured that it would be taken care of that evening, I was extremely embarrassed that my guests had to sit with no food and wait for a ridiculously long time to make arrangements for their \"special\" food. iI had brought a cake, and when it was served no one asked my guests if they'd like coffee or tea with dessert- IN FACT OUR SERVER WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I grabbed another server and was told they'd have to brew a pot of coffee- they didn't have an- my guests were already eating their cake at that point!!!!  I  could go on and on- but fair warning- STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I am having trouble remembering much about this place and I was only here a month ago. That should say a lot.  What I do remember: The decor The service  Let's start this off on a positive note, shall we? The decor was awesome. Bright and beautiful colors with a grand stairway. The art and little details all flowed together with the theme. Great for a Mexican restaurant.   Yes, they were busy. However, the service was so slow that it will go down in my \"restaurant patron\" history as the slowest to date. Seriously? It was a two hour dining experience. If my friends and I didn't have tickets to a concert at the House of Blues, it wouldn't have been as big a deal as it was. Not only that but the food was forgettable.   Chips and salsa? Forgettable. Margaritas? Don't remember what they tasted like. Tacos? I remember thinking they were OK but I don't recall anything else about the food. That, along with everything else, doesn't make for a good time.   Why, you ask, did I give Zocalos a three instead of a two or one? Because I believe that sometimes restaurants have off nights. After reading some reviews from Yelpers I tend to agree with, I decided that may just be what happened and I will eventually give Zolcalas another try."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, particularly the burritos and ANY of the appetizers.  The staff are always great. Often, we even just order takeout and it's so convenient. They have the best chips that taste like they were made there. Really great ambiance too for its kind."}
{"text":"Went for a work event and would not have selected the location.   While the food was edible (had some sort of chicken bowl and the chicken was good) there were a lot of leftovers all around that were not boxed up.   Margaritas were fine. Chips ok - salsa lacking for sure. The waitress was clearly overwhelmed and you could see the kitchen from where we sat - seemed like chaos."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch yesterday and sat on the patio. First, there were May bugs everywhere, not their fault but something to be aware of as we didn't notice them just standing on E4. The server was attentive and our food came out relatively quickly. They re-did their menu about a year ago and it seems like everything is more expensive now. $11 for a quesadilla and $12 for a burrito bowl is high in my opinion, especially for the portion you receive. I ordered the tostada salad and the salad was fine, nothing I would rave about. I was disappointed that the avocado put on my plate was very brown and looked spoiled, I didn't eat it."}
{"text":"The cocktails and guac were very tasty.  The sangria rita was refreshing and not overly sweet.   I had the Mexican chopped salad, which turned out to be completely flavorless though.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"Haiku summing it up:  Tasty Mexican But sadly too understaffed  Lovely ambience  Like the haiku says, the food was tasty, the ambience was excellent, but the restaurant seemed understaffed.  I loved the location on E 4th, even if the entry was a little out of the way through an alley.  I had made a reservation (good idea on a Saturday night - it was pretty crowded) and was shown right to a high top in the bar area.    Service: very slow, I got the impression that they were understaffed.  We had to ask several times for water after receiving our margaritas.  We had to flag someone down to take our menus off the tiny table where we had 2 large margaritas, chips, salsa, and our waters.  Bathrooms were not attended to (no TP in several of the stalls).  All of these added up to me thinking that there were simply not enough employees to take care of the needs of the restaurant.    Food: good.  Salsa tasted very fresh, and I filled up on it while I waited (forever) for our surf and turf entree.  The entree was good but unremarkable, and a small portion for $25.  I think I was also pretty jaded by the slow service and full on chips by the time the entree arrived so I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have.    Overall I wasn't super impressed with the experience.  The location is excellent and the ambience is conducive to a good time, I just think the service needs to be beefed up before I would be comfortable returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go if you want typical Mexican food.  The Carnitas were shredded, although extremely tasty, they resembled the beef jerky you get in a plastic canister.  The black beans had plenty of flavors but I thought a little under done, as for the rice, I was disappointed, minimal flavor if any.  The Mango salsa was delicious, but the red sauce served with the dishes, not so much.  The margaritas were flowing steadily out of the bar.  Complementary chips and salsa, I guess that is a bonus."}
{"text":"Loud downstairs dining by the kitchen. Waitress seemed to be frazzled and running around. Food is good for the price, home made chips, salsa, and tortillas are great. Margarita selection is awesome but beers are scarce and pricey. The tequila menu is amazing and saves the restaurant, a shot after dinner was perfect. As I had tried a lot of the tequilas in the past I found a new love, Milagro select silver barrel ($12.00 per shot) def a place to check out, just ask to sit upstairs or away from the kitchen. Shrimp tacos were great!"}
{"text":"Here now.  Chips.salsa great. Tacos awesome. Make sure to request soft tortillas.   Big tequila selection. Don't like tequila but bartenders  know thier stuff about the tequila selection. Fantastic for people watching."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, mainly for the location.  It is located right in the middle of East 4th street and conveniently close to the casino, Quicken Loans Area and Progressive Field.    The food here ok, but by no means some of the best mexican food I have had.  They have selections that include quesadillas, tacos and some house specialties.  They chips and salsa with guacamole is pretty good here, so i always like to get an order of guacamole.  I usually get the quesadilla with black beans and its pretty good!   Over all if you are downtown and want a good meal for a decent price this is a good place to go.  If you plan on going a Friday or Saturday night especially with a large group, I highly suggest you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, an awesome time with Kevin!! He really took the time to show us the different tequilas and the   complete process to really enjoy it like an aged scotch."}
{"text":"**Happy Hour Review**  Happy hour is from 2-7 pm Monday-Friday. This place is not known for great food, but their happy hour is worth stopping for before a sports game, concert, or night out downtown.   It is a party like atmosphere around the bar area which I liked. There are 5 specialty margarita/sangria drinks on the happy hour menu for only $5. They were large and really packed a punch! Chips and salsa are complimentary so get something in your stomach before you down a few more happy hour drinks. We also ordered the happy hour nachos ($5) with chicken and they surpassed our expectations!   I would probably not come here for dinner given the other great dinner spots on East 4th,but I can't wait to return for the awesome happy hour next time I'm on East 4th."}
{"text":"It's very hit or miss here. When they aren't so busy the food is delicious- waiters and waitresses honestly seem preoccupied. When it's busy don't even bother coming here - go to barrio"}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews on here.  It's one thing if you get bad service but I don't see how anyone can bad mouth the food.  It was delish.  Next time I'll be sure not to eat chips so I can eat my whole entree.  Although we really enjoyed the guacamole sampler so ya gotta eat some chips I guess.  When in town again we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a shame- the menu looks so good, but tastes not so good...service wasn't great either... One good thing- salsa isn't bad."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the traditional Mexican entrance through an alley really begins your experience at this establishment.  Let the ambiance of this restaurant take your breath away.  As you walk through the door... the lighting, the beautiful wrap around staircase and the large windows displaying E.4th Street set you in a romantic yet relaxing atmosphere.   The tequila selection is too die for.  As well as the guacamole choices.  So many delicious dishes to choose from made it hard for me to decide.   It seemed a little cliche to order tacos or burritos at a Mexican restaurant so I decided to go with the Mahi Mahi.  While the portion size seemed small when it came out, I could hardly finish the meal by the time the Dos Equis, tequila and chips and salsa set in.  My boyfriend had a side dish of black beans that I could have just ate as a meal but what fun would that have been :)  All in all, this was a nice first experience and I'm surprised as a much as a mexican food junkie that I am , that I waited this long to try it out.  We will definitely be coming back for another round of Mexican flare!!!"}
{"text":"The Bad: Our plates were dirty, my wife's steak was undercooked,and my carne Asada tacos were just plain gross.  The Good: impressive tequila list, good guacamole.  Probably a good place for happy hour drinks and appetizers, but it wasn't a great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Came for an after-party event with the CIFF so wasn't paying for food. They had set up on the first floor when you enter (the door is on the alley side to enter) so we only stayed in that area. They had a mash-up of beans, rice, chicken and garnish to make tortillas on your own. The food is seasoned ok, not super well, and def not as if folks from the community and culture of which the food represents have input in seasoning.   Their margaritas are good, if they put in less ice, as i had asked two times, they woudl be better and you'd have a fuller experience, but a watered down margarita nobody likes very much. Free chips and salsa, the salsa is ok, again a bit cold and less than exceptional with regards to flavor.  This location is NOT wheelchair accessible as the bathrooms are downstairs and there is NO elevator. Now, to get into the spot I don't recall a step, but to assume people with mobility challenges may need to use the restroom and not having an option for them to do that, to me, means it is not accessible.   Didn't try any other food on the menu or beverages."}
{"text":"Meh - at best. I ordered the Coronita which I have had at plenty of different places -- it sucked. The bartender was a dick. We had no clue when the kitchen closed. Ordered basically at close which we didn't realize till the food came out. Attributed it closing time or they are in trouble. We would not have ordered if we had known. Blood Orange margarita was pretty good. Would go back if a group wanted to stop there but would not suggest it."}
{"text":"Last resort for lunch or whenever I'm with my coworker that really likes this place. With so many options around, it physically hurts me to eat here sometimes. This place can and should do better for the sake of East 4th's reputation.   The service = Meh...the hostess was practically running ahead of us. Slow down lady, I'm in heels and your floors are slippery. The server was nice but she seemed to hurry us out. I get we are on lunch and you say that you don't want to us to be late getting back to work but pump the breaks.   The food = Eeh. The chips and salsa they give you are ok....I mean you can't really mess up chips and salsa, unless there is a crapton of salsa that spilled all over half of the chips. I ordered a salad, it was pretty tasty but really hard to eat. The tortilla shell it came in was just too much."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:: pretty fun on fourth Street. It is deceptively large given the smaller storefront.  Price: on the pricey side but maybe that's because it is on fourth Street. Very small portion sizes for the $/item especially the guac and queso and tacos  Service: average although he did a very good job warning us about certain food items that other people complain about such as chicken salad versus salad with chicken. Also- handled the kids pretty well.   Food: steak quesadilla is delicious but it does not come with any salsa. Queso Blanco is average. Salsa is good. Nothing is very spicy here."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" perfectly describes this place. The food, drinks, atmosphere, and service was not memorable, unique, or impressive, though it also wasn't terrible by any means. The entire experience was very bland, typical and boring, and the margaritas were overpriced for what they were. Of special note was how ridiculous the mango bacon gauc  was, it was average guacamole with what looked and tasted like canned bacon bits on top. There's a lot better Mexican options in Cleveland. Very meh."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice, authentic Mexican restaurant. Perhaps this was just a bad night, but there was absolutely nothing authentic, or even disguised as Mexican about the food I received. It tasted more like something I might have gotten at a roadside tavern in Medieval England. Ugh!  The server was brusque, obviously not in a good mood and openly disapproving when I asked for a specific margarita in frozen form. That was actually the most disappointing part; he should have just smiled sweetly and given me the margarita without the attitude. When will businesses learn that service is as important, if not more so, than the actual product?  The food wasn't very expensive, but still had no value at all, for it wasn't worth any of the money I paid. The food was SO bad, if I find myself in the area again I will actually give them a 2nd chance, because I can't believe a restaurant with a chef of this reputation could survive if things were consistently as awful as they were this night.  So so sorry, I hate giving bad reviews, but if their 2nd chance turns out well I will amend my review. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I went here with a large group on a work trip. We were seated quickly (we had a reservation though, and it was early evening). The timing was about what you would expect with a big group, except they got several people's order wrong, causing the entire table to wait to eat out of politeness. The red sangria was the best part of the whole experience, and it was good, not great. Our table ordered a few guacamoles and salsas, which were again good, not great. I ordered the chimichanga, and it was ok. It had a TON of peppers and onions in it, which was fine but I had hoped for more meat and cheese.  I would not pick to go here again out of all the great restaurants that I'm sure exist in a city the size of Cleveland. Maybe I'm a little biased and used to better Mexican being from Texas, but this place sure didn't meet expectations."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to see all of the negative reviews for Zocalo. It seems that some expectations are a little misplaced. This is, after all, not a five star restaurant. For a dinner for two, including an appetizer and tip, I spent less than $40. For that price, I am certainly not expecting world-class cuisine. Although the food was not authentic Mexican food, it was certainly beyond the likes of a Taco Bell style menu where everything consists of a different arrangement of ground beef, cheese and less than fresh veggies. I thought the menu had some unique options that I don't see everywhere. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our combination dinners as well as the appetizer and chips and salsa. We thought there was a great flavor to most of the food, especially the beef tamales. As a somewhat picky eater, I appreciated that the side condiments/ salsas came in a small, divided dish, so as to allow the guest to use them at his or her discretion.  Our server was attentive and competent. He was able to answer all of my questions about the menu and was on top of re-filling our drinks and chips. The atmosphere was appropriate for the price of the restaurant. It is a family restaurant, so I don't quite understand why anyone would compare it so harshly to something like Applebee's, as in my eyes, they are really along the same level of dining. For a casual meal at a great price, Zocalo has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some drinks after a Christmas play down the street.  It was late, it was cold, and we weren't ready to go home yet.  Upon arrival, the four of us were promptly seated and were asked for drink orders.  We said we'll only be drinking and consuming appetizers and then the appropriate menus were provided by our attentive waitress.  After we were seated, we noticed some extremely large margarita glasses with upside down beers in them.  We inquired about the enormous drink and were told that they were Grande Margaritas and Beeritas.  We were intrigued, to say the least. I knew what I was getting at that moment.  My brother in law was the designated driver, so he was only allowed to order beer, which he did.  The rest of us, on the other hand, contemplating alcohol consumption to the level of inebriation, ordered Grande Margaritas.  My wife ordered the Grande Beerita, I ordered a standard Grande Margarita, and my sister ordered a regular Margarita.  Ten minutes later when our drinks arrived, my sister's regular Margarita ended up being a Grande Margarita!  But they didn't charge us for it because it was a bartender mistake.  The home made nachose were very tasty, but we ordered a guacamole sampler as well, which included Bacon and Tomatillo guac, Cumin Chili Sweet Potato guac, and House guac.  The Cumin Chili Sweet Potato guac was our favorite by far.  It was soooo delicious that I could have eaten the entire bowl myself!  I'm not kidding right now!  As the night progressed, the strength of the margaritas overpowered the little bit of food we were eating and 3 out of 4 of us were plain old stewed.  Why?  Because the Grande Margarita is enough for three people to share, but we each had our own.  That's why!  It was well made - plenty of alcohol and margarita mix.  Yum!  I only had one and I was totally hung over the next day.  It knocked me on my arse.  Loved it!  ps:  They have over 120 kinds of Tequila if you're looking for shots..."}
{"text":"I guess I am rather surprised at all the negative reviews.  Being from out of town, we stumbled on this section of 4th Street on our way to the ballgame and knew we would have to stop on our way back.  We were a LARGE party and wanted to stay indoors (away from the overwhelming smoke) and did not have a problem.  Though not outstanding, we found it to be quite acceptable and enjoyed the chips and not too spicy salsa.  We were not rushed or harassed to turn our tables.  If I wanted Mexican and happened to be in Cleveland again, I would return."}
{"text":"Zocalo is a cute, ideally located restaurant.  We went on a Sat. afternoon for a couple of drinks and some food.  It was busy and we had to wait a bit for a table.  They had a wide variety of Mexican food that had some neat combinations.  We both had a burrito bowl - one with meat and one vegetarian.  They were decent.  The drinks were average (Margarita and beer).  The atmosphere is festive and fun.  I would go back and the food was good but neither the food or drink was amazing nor a must-eat."}
{"text":"We were passing by town. & this restaurant came across. We were looking for a good & local restaurant. We didn't get disappointed. Best nacho i've ever had."}
{"text":"I like fun more than being a foodie, so this place has always been a good time.  They have  small patio that is perfect E4th people watching PLUS I've always had good service (and the older I get the more picky I am with service).  The empanadas were pretty much fried perfection, so that was a good snack and provided a good base for the festivities that lied ahead.  I'm a fan and will be back.  I probably won't take my out of town friends here, but I'll come back."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences in a restaurant ever! Went on a Saturday night with a large group, we had reservations! Orders queso dip and it never came at the end of the meal we asked for it to be removed and the waitress acted surprised that we never received it ! We placed our orders and the food came out staggered throughout a 30 minute period. My food never arrived so I told The waitstaff and they did bring out three extremely soggy tacos ($5 a pop) and horrible rice and beans that I couldn't even stomach to eat. The only positive note I can make is that the two waitresses did keep our drinks full but that's it! I never plan on returning to this establishment as long as I live!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I have been to in the last ten years. Flavorless food and careless service. Its too bad because it's such a prime spot. Hopefully some day a real operator will take over and being quality, fresh food served with people who enjoy doing their job."}
{"text":"Stopped in for chips and salsa and a margarita. I had the cucumber jalapeño infused margarita and it was great. Also the salsa seemed fresh and just spicy enough. I would say they could do a little more clean up and tables are wobbly but hey it's Mexican, good local and windows and doors all open up which is fun. They have plenty of tvs too!"}
{"text":"Apparently they got a new menu \"like a week ago\" according to the staff.  It's like anything in Cleveland, could be better but it's not the worst ever. If I hadn't been spoiled by eating at nada in Cincinnati not too long ago the review might be higher.  The food would have been above average (ordered carnitas burrito and beef taco), except it came Luke warm so that moves it down to mediocre at best.  Beef and carnitas were good, burrito sauce was good, taco shell was dry but tolerable.  The black beans were kind of bland but I mixed them with my burrito so they turned out alright.  Service was pretty slow well after the dinner rush, but to be fair I sat at the bar.  I liked the atmosphere for sure.  Got a shot of tequila and it came with no chaser as was indicated would occur per the menu.  It was good tequila so that was tolerable but I mean, it's still tequila...  Good selection though if you're into liquors.    I think this place has potential to receive at least four stars on here, but it's not there yet."}
{"text":"I'd wish you buena suerte. The food was far less than average, but at least the \"regular margarita\" was decent (for $8). Not many positive things to report from this eatery."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of day we came or just the friend I was with but I had a decent lunch here, except the mango avocado margarita, dont order that, it's like baby food substance and not good at all.   We came around 1:00 or so on a Saturday and opted to sit outside. ORdered our drinks, which took forever to come even though the place was completely empty inside, and only a few tables outside (with dive bombing birds)   The chips they brought out were nice and light and very good but the pico de gallo was very bland and way to chunky for dipping   Friend ordered the carnitas, a plate of shredded pork with tortillas on the side and refried beans. He said it was very good.  I had the chicken mole enchilada with charro beans. It too was very good. The sauce was really delicious. The corn tortilla was nice and light .  Halfway through our baby food margaritas we both opted for Coronas so I would avoid the drink. They did have a nice selection of tequila I would have loved to try if it wasn't noontime.   The inside looked really cute but I can tell the service here would be really lacking if they were busy."}
{"text":"Average, just average.  And I found the salsa weird.  I'd rather go to Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"What would Chairman Kaga do?  Does anyone remember the original Iron Chef?  It was a badly dubbed  Japanese cooking competition where one of four Iron Chefs (specializing in  either Italian, Japanese, Chinese or French)  would make inexplicable concoctions from a really weird \"secret ingredient\".  So, being sort of a throwback myself, I got really excited when I heard that an Iron Chef made over Zocalo.  Sea Breem enchiladas?  Toasted miso fajitas?  Alas no, it was not Iron Chef Morimoto.  Sigh.  An American Iron Chef competition winner has improved the menu drastically from its previous salt with salt salsa on a bed of salt incarnation.  It features slightly upscale versions of Tex-Mex classics.  The pork in what the waiter describes as Mexican lasagne-- a pork enchilada-- was rather tough and stringy for carnitas. Otherwise the flavors were good-- fresh and balanced.  Mon cher chou's dish was similarly solid.  The ubiquitous chips and salsa were fresh and tasty.  You could tell that the salsa was made on premesis, rather than bottled.  The standout-- the tableside guacamole preparation.  My college roomie was Texan and did her best to educate me on the finer points of guac.  I think she would dig this.  Here, the waiter makes your guac in front of you, letting you choose how much jalapeno, tomato, onion, lime and cilantro you want.  AND he doesn't grind the avacado into mushy paste-- he leaves it a bit chunky.  Spiffy!!!  BTW-- our waiter was just about the oddest, funniest guy I have ever met.  He claims to be leaving in a few weeks, so you might still be able to catch some of his uniquely cool weirdness.  So whose cuisine reigns supreme?  I'll still take Luchita's on 117th over this, but Zocalo is a good place for lunch downtown.  Allez cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this Zocalo is a serious dining destination. I would file it into the category of decent place to drink margharitas and get down with some better-than-average, semi-creative Mexican. It is one of those places where you suspect right away that the menu SOUNDS better than the food actually will be, but It is still definitely better than your cliche neighborhood Mexican joint.  The tableside guacamole was a fun distraction. My enchiladas had a rich, hearty red sauce that I appreciated, but were predictable in every other dimension. The beef tamale was drier than sawdust, but otherwise decent...at least the meat didn't look like it came out of a blender...there were actual tender chunks of meat, recognizable as having originated from beef, in the tamale. Chile relleno was the most interesting thing I tried....not the best I've ever had, but it kept my attention. Overall, this place doesn't seriously threaten Lucita's top stop for Mexican in Cleveland.  Probably the best thing about Zocalo is it's location. The bar provides an excellent perch for observing the slow parade of suburban bourgeoisie roll into Lola in their SUVs....a delightfully amusing spectacle around 7PM on a Friday, after your sixth or seventh margharita."}
{"text":"We got into town on Monday, checked into our rented condo and found this on 4th St.  We sat at the bar pre-dinner and happy hour.  I had 2 awesome skinny margs for $5 each.  The bartender was cool and made really good drinks.  He used agave, which I love instead of the marg mix.  The salsa & chips were tasty, but the guac was not.  It was just adequate.    We stopped in for dinner on Tuesday.  Our choices were limited since it was a holiday and a lot of places were closed.  We were seated at a table this time.  I had one chicken taco, and one fish.  They were half-priced for Taco Tuesday.  The chicken was good, but the fish was flavorless.  My skinny marg was not as good this time (and full-priced).    All in all, this is not a place I would frequent if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I cannot honor this \"establishment\" with a star, yet sadly cannot post with out a rating. From the minute my husband to lack of a greeting. I understand it is a \"game night\", however that did not excuse the wait staff to pin ball us around from the point of entry. I had inquired to bar area seating being first come, to which the answer was \"yes\", until we attempted to sit at a table being cleared in the bar area, scorned and yelled at we were told to see the host... We left. Just as well as the last time I has actually eaten at zocalo the food was subpar. There are far many more eateries with above average food and service. NEVER attempting a return visit. I'll skip this \"establishment\" for Harry Buffalo!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  There's nothing better than some good margaritas and some killer steak tacos after a long day of work, but I didn't find that here.  First off, the menu is tiny and doesn't offer much variety.  And...I didn't feel like dropping ten bucks for one of their low end small margaritas, and definitely didn't want to spend almost sixteen for their premium one, so I crossed that off the list.  I also wanted to eat light, but I thought that $8.99 for one small ass taco and some not so tasty rice wasn't exactly cheap.  Oh, and after giving the waiter our cash we asked for change - and waited, and waited, and waited.  After fifteen minutes, I asked a waitress if she could help me find him, and he finally comes trudging back, complaining about a miscommunication or whatever.  Ya, I guess the last fifteen minutes you spent dodging us in hopes that we would just leave so you could have a monster tip was a miscommunication.  Whatever - never going back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were attending a late night show at the House of Blues and wanted to have dinner beforehand so we thought we would give Zocalo a try based on several recommendations from our friends.   Upon being seated we received a tiny bowl of bland salsa and a basket of overly salty, cold, hard, oily corn tortilla chips. The waitress brought us a drink menu,  took our order for guacamole, and offered to bring us some water while we were deciding on drinks. We snacked on the chips and salsa and decided to order a $38 pitcher of blood orange margaritas. The waitress came back about 15 minutes later, without the waters, and took our drink order.  About 15 minutes later the waitress came back, still no drinks, and prepared our guacamole table side. The guacamole was fresh and simple but was too bland for my tastes and lacked texture. We were very hungry however so we continued to eat the chips, salsa and guacamole. We were beginning to get pretty thirsty at this point from the overly salty chips.  Despite being there for over 30 minutes without drinks and not having placed our food order I was still optimistic the experience would get better once we had received the amazing margaritas I had heard so much about. After waiting almost 45 minutes we finally received our drinks and placed our meal order.  Now you would expect a place that prides itself on both it's tequila selection and large margarita menu to deliver something special. Well the margaritas we received were so watered down by the amount of ice they used that the flavor was basically nonexistent.  These were the most pathetic margaritas I have ever drank, if you could even call them margaritas. I could not believe that Zocalo had the audacity to charge $38 per pitcher, while using poor quality tequila (Jose Cuevro) in them, but on that on top of that the they used so much ice that you were basically getting flavored water. Their bartender should be fired, as obviously he has no clue how to make a margarita, and Zocalo should be ashamed that they are try to sell $38 pitchers of water and pass them off as margaritas.  At this point the experience was completely ruined for me.  I spent the rest of the time trying to drink my margarita as fast as I could before any more of the ice could melt and water it down further. We received our meal, Zócalo Favoritos, which I will translate as bland fajitas that surprisingly contain yellow wax beans, zucchini, asparagus, along with the standard onions, peppers and meat. Some people might enjoy this modern take on fajitas, I did not.  The services was terrible, We never did receive our waters, the food was mediocre at best, and the margaritas were just downright pathetic. How Zocalo stays open is beyond me but I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Waited 35 mins for a margarita. Another 40 mins from the time we ordered entrees to receive them. And then waited for about 25 mins for the server to even look our way and notice we were finished. Go to Barrio. This place is a waste of time for the quality of food. Or any other place on E. 4th."}
{"text":"We went there the other night for a bachelorette party. Our server in the bar was hilarious and did a fantastic job. He was awesome and we had such a great experience!  Food was great!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here on Taco Tuesdays. The tacos are 1/2 price. I sampled a few and my favorite was the shrimp taco. Next time I'm in Cleveland I will definitely be back for the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Not great food was cold 6 dollar tacos with cold cracked tortillas little meat i would not return"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, two for dinner, one for happy hour/Taco Tuesday.   Now, if there was a Taco Tuesday Zocalo to write a review on, it would be 3 or 4 stars. The prices are right for what you're getting (1/2 off margaritas making them all $5-$7 and tacos from $1-$5) and they're... decent.  As for the restaurant during regular business hours: I come from a Mexican background and I recognize that some places are just going for \"commercialized Mexican\" or \"American Mexican\" but this was weirdly neither. The flavors are bland and confusing. The fish tacos I got one time felt like they bought fish sticks out of the freezer section and plopped those soggy microwaved messes on a taco. They'll get at least 2 stars for a generally friendly staff and for at least understanding that the margarita list should be as long as it is for a \"Mexican\" restaurant with sub-par food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food i've ever had in a former alleyway off Prospect. First impression upon walking in, this place is going to be expensive! We got a booth in the corner upstairs. I think sitting right next to the staircase would be fun next time. The downstairs level seems kind of drab.   Our server \"S\" was the friendliest, kickass server one could ever hope for. My wife doesn't like heat in her Mex or meat in her tum. He was very patient and offered her ala carte options to suit her needs. Even informing us of stock in the rice. She ordered the tableside guac preparation(creamy and amazing), 2 cheese enchiladas, and an order of sopes(corn pockets with bean filing). I got the Favorito salad with grilled mahi mahi and a Fourth Street Siesta(Cuervo and peach brandy). The server  chided me about ordering a lame sounding drink. Apparently every place on East 4th has an \"east 4th\" drink. But i was all about the ingredients, not the name. It was decent.  He also saw our catalog of movies and talked film fest with us enthusiastically. Servers always like to chat up my wife. I ended up eating one of the enchiladas. It was very smokey and chewy. That's good, because i hate traditional sloppy and soggy enchiladas. My mahi mahi was tender and buttery. Again, that's good. Now the damage(close eyes as i open the bill)....THIRTY BUCKS? How can this be? I was expecting fifty at least. We left a huge tip, because i could not believe what a fantastic meal we had for that price downtown.   Now here's the part where i piss off fellow Yelpers- -Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times in the last 3 months.  The food is excellent.  The cheese dip is amazing."}
{"text":"Mexican anyone?  For lunch I had the burrito/salad bowl with portobello mushrooms and it was fantastic. The chips and salsa were also great, especially the salsa, definitely made in  house on the reg, complex flavors and fresh to death. Tacos at the table were enjoyed by the mouths they fed and the quesadilla looked pretty great too. Asked for some hot sauce from our waiter, who was cool and wanted us to have a good time, and he delivered. Four choices, and man were a couple of them real singers, knock your socks off hot, but fun to try and actually a great balance of flavor and heat. I would most certainly return for more south of the border fair, and you should too."}
{"text":"After arriving in Cleveland and checking our bags at the hotel we were sleeping in for the night (in town for Ingrid Michalson), my friend and I hit up 4th street to find a place for a drink and light snack.  I'll never say no to Mexican and neither will this particular friend - a good mix for us.  Let me start by saying the food was definitely worth four stars, if not four and a half... I had to take off a star/star and a half for other reasons.  There were two tables occupied outside - one with two people and one with three, they were both done eating and just finishing drinks - the bills were clearly ready for pickup.  Inside there was one table of four.  Despite the post lunch lull (it was a few minutes before 2 pm) there were no staff in sight.  None.  We seated ourselves at a table near the large open front, looking out onto the street.  Sorry, but if there's no sign that says to wait to be seated, and no employees in sight, there's not many other options.  We checked out the drink menu and debated over what to get.  Having dinner reservations at 5:45 pm but not eaten all day we were hungry, but didn't want to fill up.  Our server wasn't terribly friendly, nor was he knowledgeable about the selections at the bar however he did steer us in the right direction as far as an appetizer to split.  The sopes were absolutely phenomenal and the perfect size for us to split and not be full.  We had a Paloma and a Breeze to drink... neither of us are fruity drink drinkers but whatever, it was a great day and the drinks were awesome (See my quicktip).  The chips and salsa were good except that the salsa was ridiulously wet.  And I have a serious version to wet food.  Now, while salsa is often wet, this was weirdly aturated with water... especially since it was such a nice fresh mix of cut tomatoes, etc.  So if they would simply STRAIN it, or use a slotted spoon this would rival some of the best salsa/pico ever.    My only other complaint was that our server clocked our order in at 1:58.  Happy hour starts at 2 o.m.  I'm sorry, but couldn't he have waited the two minutes to give us the deal?  EIther way, it was a great experience and later in the night we were wishing we'd chose this place for dinner instead of just a little snack!"}
{"text":"Ordered some drinks to kill time.  Plane wasn't leaving for a few hours.  drinks were served stiff, just the way i like em.  Service was good. drinks were cheap, but good"}
{"text":"Good food and drink. A little on the pricey side. Also, with the front windows open to the sidewalk, a lot of birds were coming in and out of the place, which was a little wierd."}
{"text":"Went to this little place while visiting Cleveland and jt was splendid!! First of all, i dont think ive ever been served so quickly in my life. We had our food minutes after ordering.  They have a whole bunch of different types of tacos that you can order as single tacos, ranging from 3-5$. I ordered the spicy steak vampiro taco and shark taco. The spicy one was pretty darn hot but still delicious, and the shark one was unique! I mean where else can you order shark?? It was very fishy and very good! The happy hour deals werent half bad either. I definitey reccomend this place if any of you Cleveland sports fans visit the area for a game! Go Cavs!"}
{"text":"I've tried going here multiple times and each time the food and service was awful. The wait staff was rude, slow and the food was never good. There are much better places downtown to go to if you are looking for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is quite an experience. From the servers to bartenders you will never get disappointed. Our food came out quite fast but time did not sacrifice the quality. I had the Baja Fish taco Monterey Chicken Taco and a order of Papa Fritas which were to die for. Zocalos is my first choice on E. 4th. Don't forget to get a margarita"}
{"text":"Was everyone else's experience that bad?! I would give it a 3.5 if I could do half stars. I came on a Saturday night and the restaurant opened some party room tables to accommodate the overflow. We were worried that our table would be forgotten but the waitress was really attentive and we had a great time.  Now the food: Guacamole sampler - i liked 2 of 3 that we got, i'm not a big fan of crab in my guacamole. The chips were hit or miss, being miss when they were over oily and bendy, a hit otherwise.  My bf got tamales, but special ordered them with chorizo. I got mole rubbed pork chops, both dishes were generous and good for the price. My overall impression is a very solid showing especially considering they were catering to a large rehersal dinner party in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great tequila bar. Staff was savvy in tequila recommendations. My friend had just gotten engaged there and they gave her a complimentary house margarita. It was amazing. Had a cinnamon sugar rim. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay. My tacos kept falling apart so ended up just making a taco salad instead  but if you go for the drinks, you won't be disappointed. I enjoyed my alcohol far more than my meal but for what you pay and what you get I have no complaints. I'm shocked to see this place has such a low review rate."}
{"text":"Should've checked Yelp. The reviews here are all pretty accurate.  Went here with my husband for dinner and was pretty disappointed. The chips/salsa and guacamole were good. In fact the house guac was the best part of the visit. But, from there it went downhill.  The service was good, everyone was very friendly and attentive. The bad part is that the bartender got our drinks wrong and the server got my dinner wrong, good part is that they were more than happy to quickly fix.  But, the food... well... it was... ok. Let me preface all of this by saying that I love salt. I mean, if it were socially acceptable I would walk around with a salt lick attached to my wrist. But this meal? Holy salt. I mean it was REALLY over-salted. The food tasted like sub-par Mexican cuisine that was thrown together.  When I asked my husband how he liked it he said, 'this taco is horrible.' It was dry and had no seasoning. He then made the point that if you're going to go downtown, pay the $10-$20 for parking, you want a decent meal out of it and that he would never go back. Either would I.  Also a note on the kitchen staff- I question the cleanliness of everything since they wore gloves to prepare food, but then touched their face/hair/body/other people with those same gloves and went right back to preparing food. Ick.  Agree very much with other reviewers that E.4th can do better and this place is ruining downtown's culinary reputation."}
{"text":"Everything was just not so good.  The service was slow, and we frequently saw the server standing around while we were waiting.  We aren't a needy table, I promise!  The overpriced queso came in a super tiny dish (where's the rest of it?) and was lukewarm.  We had to hunt down our own silverware after dinner came and take it from another table (sorry, but we had asked 2 different staff members first).  The food was just okay, nothing special.  We were really disappointed.  =/"}
{"text":"Uhh, was that Montezuma's Revenge or was that Zocalo?  I don't know if there is a difference, and I'm not feeling very well today.  We went last night for a birthday.  Out of everyone's meals, people were ambivalent at best.  I ordered the nachos, which looked like nacho's but weren't anything particularly interesting.  In addition, they were skimpy on the sour cream and guac, which are 90% of the reason I order nachos.    The tacos were soggy, the fries were soggy (they put a napkin in the bottom they are so greasy!), the portions are small, and honestly, the best part of the meal were the free chips and salsa!  Oh, and the salt rim on the top of it is that the margaritas are average but VERY expensive.  $30 for a pitcher that fills up 4 ice filled glasses?  REALLY!?!?  We left with a $100 bill where I wasn't feeling particularly happy with my food and I also wasn't even feeling a buzz!  What the!?!?    I just have just put that $100 into a piggy bank for a real excursion to Mexico.  That's what I'll do next time instead of going to Zocalo.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was a little afraid to try but there were lots of people for lunch so we gave it a try. The guacamole was fresh and very good. We had good service and got our food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Cutting straight to the point, server was bad, food was just okay and the music was really loud; we could barely here each other while talking across the table."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their blackberry margaritas. I always get the grande! I also love their beef quesadillas."}
{"text":"Went for a first time visit recently before an Indian's game.  Was able to get seated right away as the inside is large with 2 levels of seating.  The drink menu offered many different flavors of margaritas. Asked the server for a suggestion as we do not like sour mix and wanted it made with fresh juice.  He suggested the skinny margarita ($17 for a grande - 2 serving glass) as all the others were made with sour mix.  Disappointed that a tequileria would not offer more freshly made margarita drinks.  We told the server it was our first visit and needed a minute to look over the menu.  Once he brought our drink, hubby ordered a chicken quesadilla ($8)  and I ordered two Tijuana street tacos. ($4 each).  The tacos had a corn tortilla base which was soggy and wet, so I could only eat the toppings.  I tried to get servers attention to tell him and was not successful.  He never made eye contact with us or came back to see if we needed anything.  I   did not have luck getting his attention for the bill either.  Husband finally did and I voiced my complaint on the food.  I was told that all the servers complained about that problem to management and they were taken off the menu for a little bit, only to be brought back again.  He said next time we come back, he would guide us on the menu.  What??  Why was I not offered that tidbit of information when I ordered them?    On a positive note, husbands quesadilla was tasty and he enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've gone 3 times. Food is just okay. Best thing I've had it to just order tacos a la carte. I'd rather go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Hands down worst Mexican cuisine I have ever experienced.  Fist off the margaritas. They had some decent flavors to choose from. Ordered the blood orange & 2 pomegranates. Like I said decent flavor but no booze. For $30 in drinks for my self I should at least catch a buzz. This was not the case. My wife had 2 margaritas and on the second one had to order a shot on the side just to make sure there was booze in it. I ordered the Chimichanga. I've had these many many times & loved everyone till tonight. It was very large and impressive. I have to admit I was excited unit I took my first bit. A Chimichanga I'd a deep fried burrito in a nut shell.  So it should be crisp. This was not the case. It was mush, like they only put it in the frier for 10 seconds.  I dissected the limp bland monstrosity in front of of me. Tasted the steak, it was OK,not great. Guacamole inside tasted just like avocado.  No seasoning.  Then I tried the rice. More disappointment.  Very bland. Tasted like white rice boiled in chicken broth.  Beans were OK. All in all the highlight of our meal was our glass of ice water. I will never be coming back to this establishment.  Go around next door to Barrio. Or Taco Bell. I guarantee you will get better, more authentic food there. Disappointment, frustration, & sober explains our $100 mistake of choosing this place."}
{"text":"2 stars based on the calamares. They were cold, chewy, and not edible. I sent them back, and to quickly have something on hand, I ordered the ensalada de casa. Best part of that, the jicama slices.  The dressing was just some bottled ranch mixed with salsa. And not even good ranch.   We also had the mahi mahi, which was very tender and tasty. Just didn't sell me on a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I didn't have high expectations for the food or service here. I was pleasantly surprised to find that was not the case."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland when I was interning there. The environment is great for large parties and it is such a party!   I brought friends here, had family over and went with coworkers to eat here. Such a versatile restaurant! They have a great bar and the food is phenomenal! It is very fresh and one of the best things on East 5th Euclid!  One of my visits, I took a friend and we went crazy. We had an appetizer of this like Churritos with green salsa. It has minced pork, cheese and onion inside. Then we each got a side salad and then entrees! She got the combo platter and I got this Vampiro taco plate which is basically tacos with jalapenos and cheese, covered in tomatos, salsa, onions and beef. I have also had their pulled pork torta which had really fresh vegetables. I also loved the poblano pepper enchiladas. Just the right amount of spice,   I highly recommend this place and would love to visit again!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone rags on this place. I've only been here a handful of times, but the drinks have always been great and the chips and salsa fresh and tasty.  The food is made with fresh ingredients, has good flavor, and is served up quickly like most Mexican restaurants!  I had the Zocalo Carnitas Burrito and it was really good...savory, oooey, gooey melted goodness on a plate!  I'll get a pic next time! Service is average...not the greatest, but not the worst... it depends on the night.  Well, if you're downtown and craving Mexican before a Tribe or Cavs game, Zocalo doesn't disappoint. Stop in and have a margarita!"}
{"text":"I was a little surprised by some of the reviews here. Zocalo's may not be flashy, but if you are look for a quick spot to grab some snacks or drinks, then it gets the job done.   The staff was very accommodating and Becca, our waitress, was fantastic! She was super friendly, attentive, and took great care of our table.   Admittedly, we only had chips, salsa, and guacamole along with a pitcher of margaritas, all of which was tasty and reasonably priced. The menu had your standard Mexican restaurant options (burritos, enchiladas, tacos). The restaurant was fairly clean with a lot of space and several big screen tvs for airing the games. There were private rooms downstairs.   All in all, if you are not looking to wow anyone and want good food at a reasonable price, then Zocalo's is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Zocalo gets points for having a tequila room (yes, a whole room full of tequila), open-area seating, and a cool atmosphere.   However, service was disappointing.  The place was not that busy but I still had to ask the bartender to close me out because the waitress was too busy talking to fellow servers to close me out.    If I had to describe the food in one word, it would be weird.  I ordered the veggie burrito bowl.  Cauliflower and broccoli--in Mexican food?  No thanks.  The dish was this weird amalgamation of not-so-complimentary flavors.    I will not be back for food, but I might consider going there for drinks."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible.  Absolute run around.  I had bad experiences in the past, but gave them yet again another chance.  Last time.  Leaving hungry with food order never placed."}
