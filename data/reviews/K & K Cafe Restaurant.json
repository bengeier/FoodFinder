{"text":"I come here often for dinner takeout, where you can get a rice/noodle dish with soup for ~$8-9.  The owner is super friendly, and the food is pretty good.  Obviously the standard here is a HK style cafe, not a fancy Chinese restaurant.  All-in-all, pretty good value and quality for what you get."}
{"text":"This is a small family run restaurant that serves good quality Cantonese food. They have lunch and afternoon specials.  They also have dinner combos, where you can choose your own dishes off the menu for a certain price. The portions are pretty big. The dishes have good wok hay. This is a simple no frills restaurant that serves good food. Would recommend and return when in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for breakfast. The breakfast combo of satay beef noodles & eggs with protein/toast is a great choice. Starts at $5.25 but you can modify it (change to instant noodles, hot to cold drink) for a bit extra. Overall a very nice place to eat that can fill you up nicely for the morning."}
{"text":"Best Hong Kong style satay beef noodles in town. The satay beef is freshly fried upon your order. The omelette with ham slice is nice too. One of the best place in Toronto for breakfast and afternoon tea."}
{"text":"K&K cafe is a HK style cafe that serves the usually breakfast food that you find around Markham. The food is above average with a low selection on the menu. That being said everything on the menu is pretty good."}
{"text":"Good taste, good value. Not great, but good solid 3*.... Yelp is forcing me to write more before it lets me post but I have nothing else to say..."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 (Decent, Cha Chan Tang style) Service: 3.5/5 (Fast)   Note: No MSG (Monosodium glutamate), Full of selections, Menu photo attached.   We came here for Lunch, place was kind of busy but service and tables were quick.   We quickly made decision and ordered 7 small pieces of honey garlic wings ($6.49) and their two-dish combo for ($21.99); dishes of your choice (we ordered baked spare ribs with thousand island sauce and beef brisket with radish); they came with rice and watered-down soup. The beef in the beef brisket wasn't anything special, but it was tender, but the dish was overloaded with flavorless radish. The wings were crispy and flavourful, worth the price. The baked spare ribs with thousand island sauce were tasty, tangy and easy to chew.  Overall we enjoyed our meal, and will come back to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to rate it 0 instead of 1.  So I ordered this fried chicken wing with fries but 3 of the 4 wings went stale and had a weird taste.  I normally eat all the fries first and then wings.  When i had that first bite I immediately let the waitress know about the wings.  She nicely asked me to look at the menu again but when I picked something else, she told me I was restricted to ordering only anything with fries because I finished half of the fries already.  What an experience."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!  Pretty standard HK cafe food.   Lunch deal $8.99 Baked pork with tomato sauce comes with soup and hot drink. My dish had good flavours, not oily and the pork was not dry. The portion was large enough to fill me up. The HK milk tea is also quite tasty.   Decent service during the time we went. For $8.99, this is a pretty good place to grab a quick, filling, lunch meal."}
{"text":"We came here for afternoon tea. I've ordered the spam and egg sandwich. The crust of the bread was a bit hard. I had to peel it all off. The hot lemon tea is mediocre. Nothing to write home about.  The service, when you ask them what a Spanish coffee is, they will just tell you order it to try. Again at this price point, I don't expect a lot of service. My brother did say he enjoyed the coffee mixed with milk tea."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that there aren't more reviews for K & K Cafe.   It is a \"cha chaan teng\", and I've been here twice for their breakfast special.  There are various breakfast combinations to choose from. I especially enjoyed ordering their 2 eggs with sausage and toast.  They serve western style breakfast sausages, which is exactly what I want, because some other *cha chaan tengs* give you a hot dog wiener for the sausage -__- Their scrambled eggs are also perfect, not too overdone, a bit wet, typical cha chaan teng style eggs. My fiance and I like to each order a breakfast special (eggs toast meat), and share a wet breakfast special (sometimes the satay beef noodle soup or macaroni ham soup), and we get 3 drinks included. Their soy milk is pretty good.  There is lots of free parking in the plaza, which is shared with McDonalds."}
{"text":"Nice HK style cafe (cha chan tang). Breakfast deals are great with lots of options and their lunch special ranges from $8 to $10."}
{"text":"Good food for very affordable prices!  K&K is my personal canteen - I come here almost twice a week.   This is a family-owned HK style cafe that has a pretty good selection of dishes.  They have combos for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner, which typically comes with a drink and for dinner also a soup.  The service is very friendly, but they are probably more confident in Chinese than in English.  However, language should not be an issue here.  Their combos for dinner come to $7.90 after taxes, which includes a big rice/noodle dish, bowl of soup, and a drink.  This kind of value just can't be beat!  Note that they are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Great Services! Reasonable Prices!  All Day Specials that includes a soup and drink from $5.99.  K & K Cafe Restaurant is another one of those Hong Kong Style Cafe that caters to customers that want to have a quick bite at a good price.  My Preserved Vegetables with Pork Set ($5.99) is quite flavoured and the Milk Tea is silky and smooth.  A good choice if you are in the area! Don't come Tuesday though, as they are closed!"}
{"text":"My curry beef noodle bowl was really good. Coffee is also very nice ~~~5 dollar combo is a good choice"}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall Chinese cafe that's located in a plaza. If you're not searching for it, there's definitely a chance of you driving by it and missing it. They serve the typical HK cafe style of dishes such as noodles and spaghettis and rices. There was an actually healthy amount of people coming in for a cheap lunch. I opted for the spaghetti with pork chop special which comes with a drink and I believe it was $8.99. It's a bit pricier than say Hollywood Cafe, but I ain't gonna drive all the way there.  Surprisingly, it was quite good! I found the portions quite large, and they gave a plentiful amount of pork chop which was awesome. Their HK tea was also very strong and made well. I was pleasantly surprised about the quality and portions here. This was definitely a Yelp recommendation find, because I wouldn't have come without these great ratings.  If you're in the area and you need a filling and good lunch/breakfast, K&K Cafe is a good choice. 3.5+/5."}
