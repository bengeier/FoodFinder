{"text":"The BEST BEST BEST place to eat in the area. It's a family owned restaurant. The owner Ray takes his time to prepare you food that when you eat it, feels like it was definitely \"made with love\". The best is the ribs. The ribs are the ribs and his breakfast sandwiches. They are 100 times better than any fast food breakfast sandwich and the prices are very affordable. It's only $5 for a breakfast sandwich!!!! I would definitely recommend going there and making friends with Ray."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have never been disappointed in anything we've ordered. The turkey panini is so delicious, and the soups and salads are always tasty. Their breakfast choices are also reasonably priced. It's great that they make everything fresh each day so nothing's ever stale."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! You have to try their prime ribs and beef brisket sandwich. The meat is smoked for 17+ hours. The flavours are intense and the meat is tender. The guys there are awesome! I normally do take out and the food is always warm and fresh."}
{"text":"Found my new favourite spot! 

Before anything else... GET THEIR BEEF RIBS, for $13 this deal packs a punch. The meat is so tender it slides right off the bone. The sauce is savoury, smooth and absolutely delicious. I also ordered their Mac and cheese as a side, perfectly to compliment the juicy beef ribs. Writing this review is making me crave more BEEF RIBS! The girlfriend ordered a BLT, she loved it... But back to the BEEF RIBS, go get it, highly recommended!

Ray is an awesome guy, great family owned business and customer service is on point! Great character, he remembers your name!

The down side is parking but there is a gas station beside them, park near the car wash.

I'll be here weekly for lunch now. I call this places hidden gem."}
{"text":"After hearing about this new addition to Port Credit I went to Fork My Life for the first time today. The place was bright, very clean and had a cheerful feel to it. The staff was friendly and attentive. 
On this visit I ordered the turkey panini with roasted turkey ( not processed) mixed greens and aioli. The sandwich was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the roast beef panini and that, too, was excellent. I'm looking forward to returning and trying something else on the menu- maybe the ribs."}
{"text":"First off the service at this place is incredible.  Always friendly and happy to see you.

Burgers are the best in Port Credit.  Seasoned perfectly and you get two patties per burger order.  Just straight up classic burgers dressed as you like.  

Smoked Brisket is smoked for 17 hours and is tasty.  

I'd probably recommend other dishes but I just can't stop ordering their burger."}
{"text":"I was down in Port Credit last night.  I ordered their vegetarian panini which was made with very fresh ingredients and tasted pretty good for $10 tax in.  For the sandwich itself, I'd give it four stars.

However, I need to dock a combined one star for the following reasons:

1.  Booths were dirty and worn down.  I saw quite a few flies too.  For a new restaurant, I would expect them to be cleaner.  In addition, one employee was just chilling with his friends.  I was quite surprised he wasn't wiping the dirty tables.

2. When you say fresh, it implies some type of healthy options.  They use plain white sourdough for their panini.  Why is there no whole wheat?

Verdict: not sure I'd come back.  I get the feeling the owner is focusing too much on food without providing a clean atmosphere to eat in."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work after hearing from a buddy they had some badass beef ribs....and he did not lie they were fall of the bone juicy deliciousness.  And the BBQ sauce a sweet and smokey but subtle.  Fries were crispy and had a awesome seasoning to them. Going back soon to try some more stuff.  Check it out guarantee you would think be disappointed"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Place was excellent. I'm giving them 5 star because their beef brisket panini, pulled beef rib panini, and their customer service! We also tried the turkey panini which was good but was a bit dry. The hot sauce was really flavorful but could of been better if they made another hotter version of the hot sauce with more kick to it. Will definitely come back. Hoping to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"After driving by this place many times, we decided to stop in and try it out. It is definitely a family owned business with the son out front and Mom and Dad in the back cooking. I wish I could say our meal was as great as many of the reviews. 

I had the FML burger and it came out about 5 minutes after ordering it so I know it must have been part way done. The bun turns wet by the time you get through half of it and then it becomes a \"fork my burger\" type of meal.

The seating is OK, although it's located on the dead East end of Port Credit. You have to order your meal at the front counter and they bring it out to you. I didn't have the ribs but I can imagine they would be good because there's no need to cook those as ordered. They must be cooking for hours somewhere in the back.

And while I would have given this place a 3 anyway for what we had to eat, the real turn off is the dirty washroom. While we were there, the son, was socializing and coming in and out of the place. What he should have been doing is cleaning that bathroom. Even the worst fast food places take better care of their facilities.

This was definitely a \"one and done\" type of place for me. I really doubt they'll be around next year."}
{"text":"Firstly, name of the restaurant doesn't really say too much about what kinda food that they serve.  However, it does indicate that the owners have a sense of humour...and are younger.

Menu consists of Paninis (no fork), a Chicken Wrap (also no fork), a burger (still no fork), a Kale Salad (fork!), & sides like Mac & Cheese (fork!), Fries (fork, if you're fancy like that).  Price points are on-point, especially $8.50 for a 2-patty burger, and sides like Mac & Cheese.

I had the FML Burger (patty was well-seasoned and you can select your own toppings), Mac & Cheese ($2.50 \"small\"), & tried the Kale Salad ($7, very fresh tasting and the dressing was a bit sweet 'n light).  I really loved the burger bun 'cause it held together, wasn't too fluffy, and fresh - maybe it was potato bread?  It's difficult to explain, but you'll see what I mean if you get their burger!

Staff was friendly and smiley.  Would definitely go back to check out other items on their menu.

Restaurant takes over the former Bamboo Legend spot.  Only downside I see is that there isn't really any legal parking spots.  Patrons parked directly in-front of restaurant, but I know that when I went to Bamboo Legend, the owners told me that that really wasn't a spot.  You can park at Planet Organic (to the East), but not ideal when it gets cold."}
