{"text":"I lived in SzeChuan for half a year a decade ago and this is the first restaurant I've been to where my first taste of a dish transported me back there. Best Chinese I've had outside of China. If only it would get a liquor license, perhaps I could enjoy a glass of Jiu with my meal, as in SzeChuan. Makes me miss MaLaTang even more..."}
{"text":"Found this place quite by accident while on a long walk across Parc Mount Royal and then down Cotes de Neiges.  Had the Twice Cooked Pork, Dry Cooked String Beans, Yu Hsiang Eggplant, and Lamb with Cumin.  The Twice Cooked Pork used smoked pork belly and was nice and fatty for good flavor and texture. There was very little sauce but it was sufficiently intense without being overpowering. The vegetables were cooked just right and balanced the earthiness of the sauce and smokey pork belly.  Personally I might have liked a little more chili but I tend to like more than most: that said, I'd probably be considered a light-weight in Schezuan province so there you go.  The eggplant was nicely cooked to a tender perfection without falling apart, and the eggplants were the small purple Asian ones, not large tough Italian eggplants.  The sauce was characteristically tangy and sweet while having the earthy undertones which are particular to black vinegar.  Most of us are familiar with Mongolian Beef, but the truth is Mongolians eat much more lamb than beef or pork. Imagine Mongolian Beef made with tender lamb, without the foo-foo noodles, and redolent of pan toasted cumin... And that would be this dish. The lamb was succulent and not overcooked... though a little more fat could have been trimmed from it.  The string beans were the least noteworthy. Amongst the Chinese this dish is usually cooked with the string beans being crunchy to the point of being borderline undercooked by Western standards. Ours were cooked to Western tastes, and it's my fault for not calling that out when we ordered. The ground pork was just present enough to add flavor without distracting from the beans themselves.  On another visit (and I will be back!) I'll have to go off the beaten path and try some less common dishes like the Chinese Cabbage with Schezuan Peppercorns and Chilis or the Soft Tofu and Eggplant Casserole with Ground Pork.  And perhaps they'll add tender bamboo shoot tips in soy sauce with chili and peanuts as an appetizer by then.  The decor was sparse, which I usually interpret to mean (at least in East Asian restaurants) that their focus is on the right place: the food.  The staff were friendly and helpful, even helping us maneuver a baby stroller up the somewhat challenging stairs when we left.  A real find, and if I currently lived in Montreal, this might be my go-to place for spicy Chinese food."}
{"text":"Let's talk about this restaurant and how it is the BEST and most authentic Szechuan food that I have come across outside of China, and trust me, I have been to A LOT of Chinese restaurants all over the world. I am never disappointed by this place. Sure, the service may be a little slow, and you have to point at things on the menu when ordering, but the food is the right amount of spicy, the right amount of hot (if it's supposed to be hot), and the perfect amount of cooked. Every time I go there, I have to put on a pair of Lululemons because I just know that I'll end up stuffing my face till I can no longer breathe, and even then, when I'm done and have eaten my own body weight, I'm always a little bit sad that I can't eat anymore.  Don't know what to order? Get the Ma Po Tofu, the Kung Pao Chicken, and ask for some sort of fish in this hot pot thing- I'm not sure what they put in there, but I'm pretty sure it's the most delicious Chinese dish ever. Don't forget to ask for lots of rice. It's REALLY spicy. Like- really REALLY spicy."}
{"text":"Great discovery on the area! If you like spicy food, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese delivery I've had and I've ordered similar dishes in Vancouver, Calgary, and Toronto! Cumin lamb, Gong Bao chicken with peanuts, crispy beef, and hunan dumplins in peanut sauce all showed up within 35 minutes for $48 with taxes. With rice, it was enough food for four or five.  Spicy and full of great flavours, all these dishes were rich in their own unique tastes and textures. I would recommend laying out any of these on a bed of rice to absorb the outstanding sauces and avoid wasting a single drop. I ate almost nothing but this food all weekend and somehow managed to avoid the usual \"burning ring of fire\" that tends to accompany these meals as they depart my body."}
{"text":"The food here is great,  the most authentic szechuan food i know in montreal. I donot remember the name of the dish, but the spicy fish and tofu together is vey good."}
{"text":"spicy fish with soybean sprouts. When you're looking through any kind of menu, if there's a little illustration of a chili pepper next to the dish, more times than none, this is code for 'this dish is spicy'. However, when you see three chili peppers, it's usually a good indication that the dish will probably make you sweat in places you didn't know you had glands, like here at Cuisine Szechuan. Don't be shy and drink the soup... you NEED to."}
{"text":"I have tried the majority of chinese restaurants in Montreal, and as a taiwanese born, i have to say that my family of 6 did not enjoy the food here for it being overly heavy on salt and spices. We ordered water boiled fish, cumin beef, pickled vegetable chicken, seaweed, garlic pork and EVERYTHING was way too spicy despite asking for mild spices. The service is acceptable as in most chinese places, but poor by caucasian standard. Needless to say i will not be going back."}
{"text":"I had never had Szechuan peppers before, and I was amazed by how wonderful they, and my dish, were. I had fish with tofu in Szechuan sauce.  Random comments: -It was the perfect level of spicy--chock full of spicy red peppers and cool Szechuan peppers. -The fish and the tofu were incredibly soft. This is the kind of tofu I dream of; the kind of tofu that makes me disappointed when I order tofu in most restaurants -The broth (the dish was like a stew) was also delicious, though I lack the vocabulary to describe it properly. -Take heed: the portion was monstrous! It could easily have fed three people, and probably four.  I'm bummed that this place doesn't live near me! I will definitely be looking for a Szechuan place near home."}
{"text":"I didn't like the food...missing flavors...beef satay was terrible...general tao was hard to chew...and the veggies were watery...not recommending at all!"}
{"text":"HOT HOT HOT!  Oh and damn amazingly hot!!!  Thanks Cuisine Szechuan for a meal I will remember on my trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, Food - here we go.  Atmosphere:  If you are coming to eat at Cuisine Szechuan, you are definitely coming for the food and not the ambiance.  In fact - there isn't anything that can resemble an ambiance at Cuisine Szechuan, it's simply a square dinning room filled with long tables and a mish-mash of chairs - reminiscent of an army mess hall or a very very small high school cafeteria.  Service:  The service at Cuisine Szechuan, as many Chinese restaurants located in the Concordia / St. Catherine's street area west of Guy Street, is geared to simply bring you the food you ordered and then plenty of water at various intervals.  If you do not know what to order, or have any questions, don't expect much in the way of help.  It may be an issue of language (French or English) or motivation - but whatever it is, it does not bode well for those who like to ask for a little extra information.  Food:  I'am by no means an expert on Szechuan cuisine, but my Chinese friends assure me that Cuisine Szechuan's food is what they would call Chinese.  Proof of this is that Cuisine Szechuan is often filled with Chinese people - there's no better recommendation than that!  There are several types of soups on the menu (jackpot!), along with an assortment of dishes made with rice, noodles, or protein (chicken and pork mainly).  Careful it's Spicy!"}
{"text":"When you order a take out, be aware that they may charge you 15% tips and give you left over food. However, you probably will be safe if you are white, 'cause they only scam foreigners who barely speak English.   The bottom line is that don't go there. There is plenty good Chinese food around here. Why bother to lose money and good mood at this $itty place."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Szechuan cuisine, appealing looking, unfortunately extremely salty. Service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I absolutely looove spicy food!  I used to live in an apartment building next door to this restaurant and I used to walk past it everyday. Tonight was the first time I ever went and I was definitely not disappointed!   They were very welcoming and told us we could sit wherever we wanted to. We ordered dumplings and a spicy beef and tofu stew. The portions were huge and tasted amazing!  I was a little disappointed with the dumplings though, because they were the exact ones I buy for my fiance at home, but overall the pricing and the food were reasonable, came to our table quickly, and filled our happy bellies. At one point the owner came up to us to ask us to pay because he had to close the machine, but he told us we could take as much time as we wanted and that we didn't have to rush whatsoever. I found that very nice of him.  We also asked if it was possible to take the rest of our stew home (which was a very fussy dish) and he managed to figure out a way to wrap it up for us, and was really polite the whole night.  I will definitely go back! So welcoming, and very good stews."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chinese restaurants by far. Their chicken peanuts is to die for .. It's not as spicy as it looks like with all the dried red peppers .. Have if with white rice and ur golden. It's a nice place to go to with big hungry groups as they have hot big platters for sharing that comes on a hot plate .."}
{"text":"Wow New Flavours. Flower Soup, Cucumber salad, Gung Bao Chicken. Good, Good, Good. Big dishes. Spicy. Excited to come back."}
{"text":"The food ranks with the best in Boston and  NY.  With a little decor it could be a 5 star rating. While I've had better in China, this is whole lot closer.  Chili wontons- great Fish in spicy broth- great fried chicken w/ potato - excellent"}
{"text":"Wonderful, spicy, and cheap!  When we go, we always get the stir fried green beans with shredded pork. I probably haven't been as adventurous as I should be, but we've enjoyed everything we've ever gotten, including the twice-cooked pork, the cumin beef, and beef stew. The wonton soup has a strong sesame flavor that makes it stand out from what you normally get at a Chinese place."}
{"text":"I really did not like this resturant. I went in the summer and they did not have an A/C. Most of their food is spicy so you will sweat like a pig. The food was not tasty at all. I have been to a lot of chinese resturants and this one is certanliy the worst. The soup smelled like a raw chicken which was  so discusting. Sorry but thisbis the truth."}
{"text":"Went here based on previous reviews and failed to pay attention to the dates of those reviews. Sad to say did not find the food good at all. And, even worse, no beer! Asked for spicy ginger beef with shallots, got tired looking beef something with onions (big, soggy ones). Salt and pepper shrimp were soaked in some kind of chilli sauce, no salt detected. Even the rice was bad. Don't take credit cards. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I go there often.  I love this place.  The best Szechuan in Montreal.  No doubt.  If you like it spicy, that is the place to go.  The Spicy Boil Fish is really really good.  I also enjoy the Spicy Cucumber Salad."}
{"text":"Unprofessional food made by the owner of the restaurant. They recently change their chef and food just taste like home made food. Not recommend this place and won't come again. Ordered 3 dished for two ppl and all of them taste bad in my opinion. It's worse than the Chinese express food sold in the food court."}
{"text":"It used to be very good. But recently I ordered a couple of time from them and each time was a disappointment. The quantity was very small (half full of the take out box), the taste was not as good and the food quality was poor."}
{"text":"Their cumin chicken is awesome! Such a nice place with great food and good service:-)"}
{"text":"Not a very original name, but very good food.   Warm welcome. Small underground place, but tables are not cramped. Very extensive menu with a just a few not Szechuan/spicy options (won ton soup, general Tao, etc.)  nice if someone in your group can't handle spicy.  The sweet and sour soup was thick and delicious. The vegetables were crunchy, tasty and spicy, a bit too salty to my taste. The beef was very tender, with complex and spicy flavors. Good efficient service. A few beers available. Very nice warming dinner on a cold January night."}
{"text":"We checked on Yelp and saw this place had 4 starts and 41 reviews before we walked to this restaurant from our hotel.  There were a lot of people eating there on a Monday night at 7:50pm when we walked in the restaurant.  We were very happy that we could have \"to go\" so we did not have to eat at the restaurant because the restaurant smelled greasy.    We ordered fried rice and a vegetable dish.  We had to prepay the food - almost $20 including taxes.  I asked how long it would take and the casher told us 10 to 15 minutes.  We went out the restaurant to get fresh air and checked out other local stores.  We came back after 15 minutes and waited for another 15 minutes before we got our food.   Our cloth, face, and hair all smelled greasy after sitting in the restaurant for 15 minutes.     The fried rice was average.  The quality of the rice was not very good - mostly broken rice pieces.  The vegetable dish was very salty and lots of \"water\".   The portion did not look as the same size as the people who ate at the restaurant or the photos on yelp.  I would compare this place as one of the greasy and old New York China Town place but without the good food.   Panda Express had better food.  I cannot compare this restaurant to other Montreal Chinese restaurant since this was our fist Chinese restaurant experience in Montreal and Canada."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant I thought the food was OK. Not great but not bad.  Order tea and it was lukewarm. Not a great first sign and our water was poured in beer stein's???  The food on the other hand was tasty and the menu extensive."}
{"text":"There you go, the best Sichuanese restaurant in Montreal, period.  Everything tastes so great. Food is not that spicy, but just enough to stimulate your pallets and make everything work together.  Some dishes looked weird and do not exist in Chinese cuisine, such as the \"spicy boiling chicken\", I think they are just changing the protein while keeping the same sauce used from \"spicy boiling beef\" ().  The only dish I'm going to complain is the spicy chicken that was the cold dish. The chicken was really dry and the texture was slightly hard, kind of overcooked, but the taste was alright.  The portions were huge, but the dishes were still well done and prepared with hearts. Each dish costs approximately 7~10$, and food came to the table really fast.  The waiters were very friendly and the service was efficient, though sometimes they may ignore you because the place seems to be very, very busy during dinnertime.  The hygiene is probably the only reason why this place is a 4-stars for me. The table were not very clean, and the walls are slightly dirty. Also, there is no A/C so take that in mind while eating spicy and hot dishes during summer.  Also, they do not accept credit cards, so make sure you have debit or cash with you!"}
{"text":"I was jonesing for some real Chinese food and this place definitely hit the spot. The twice cooked pork and cucumbers in chili sauce was some of the best I have ever had, even in China.  Will definitely drive the five hours to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This place ruined all other Chinese restaurants for me. Seriously. I've eaten everything here that I can pronounce and even a couple things I can't.   The absolute MUST from this place is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It is smaller than it used to be, but still quite a lot of food. Worth every bit of pain you will feel the next day. In fact, you'll probably grow to like it. I recommend you ask for a dish of steamed broccoli (not on menu) to incorporate with the dish.   Other homeruns include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork and the shallot beef. All so very, very good. Remember, though, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really, really mean it.   Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: Risky at best.  3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible. 5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Super good food. It's spicy though, so watch out if that isn't your thing. Great day service by nice people."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 dishes. 3 spicy, 1 dish for reprieve (thank god!),  Our spicy dishes were: \"water boiled fish\". It was a recommended dish from our waiter. As well as the \"hui guo ro\" . A tad spicy and not as spicy. They were unfortunately without the Szechuan style . And to hit it off for the spicy team - the lamb pot. For the non-spicy dish, we ordered the seafood crispy rice dish.  The  was a tad spicy, not killer. Although a tad on the spicy side so definitely needed some rice as compliment. Then came our . The portion was huge and it was spicy. Luckily, this is the good spicy where you can still taste the ingredients such as the nicely cooked fish. As we ate away enjoying our first 2 dishes, the waiter brought our third. lamb boiled in chili pepper soup. Plus they put in on a mini stove to keep it piping hot. This was spicy! But definitely a treat. So for those who love spicy and aren't afraid of chili peppers. Try it!  Also, service was good. Tea came regularly and the ice cold water saved me a couple of times."}
{"text":"I love szechuan food. This place is very good for that. I can't quite remember what I had ordered because I only read the chinese name for it. I believe it was preserved pork with vegetables and rice. IT was pretty salty - but you're suppose to combine the flavors with the side dishes (rice and vegetables). Overall, it's flavors are indeed: authentic. I wished I had ordered something more spicy - but my friend had a sore throat. Next time for sure though! I only come during the winter though - because eating here gives me that cozy feeling of being surrounded in spicy aroma (if that makes sense). You don't need to wait for long either. Customer service is decent - but I didn't expect something extremely fancy or anything considering the decor."}
{"text":"Really sooooooooo poor service!! And very interesting... When the first time I went there, the male waiter chatted with me a lot about my own privacy, such as where you were living in and \"do you want a restaurant card for you to always eating without any money?\" And the second time there were 2 waiters there. Also the same male waiter asked me A LOT about my job and background!! I feel so bad because I thought he showed disrespect to customers!! And the other female waiter said nothing about that but looked like very angry. And when I was paying the bill, she's ATTITUDE made my feel very confused and angry ( about the paying process), so I decided to just give her 1 dollar tips (34.49 in total). However, she told me I MUST give her much more because she thought I was DISRESPECTFUL to HER and SHE MUST GET MORE tips!! It was like... Oh my god! And of course I didn't give her more tips, and I think 1 is a little bit more than what I wanted to give... Oh shit, because they even do not have any manager to solve the problem, and this situation is soooooooo low and instead of less tips, I don't know how to safeguard my rights!   I really think a restaurant which doesn't have managers to solve the problem is very INFORMAL! When I was communicate with the female waiter, anyone working in this restaurant were just WATCHING us, ah ha maybe there was a movie showing now??? Especially they were very impolite at first, but reversely said I was very \"disrespectful\" to them. That's tooooooo interesting and I don't wanna go back to there any more! So bad the service and mechanism, I don't think the food there is very healthy. Maybe the cooking oil's quality is in low-grade... Of course just a guess because of the most AMAZING experience when eating in the restaurants!~"}
{"text":"Just like your neighborhood Chinese restaurant - only the food is incredible - and truly spiced.  Definitely worth a visit or for takeout - especially if you love some heat in your meal."}
{"text":"Spicy! Spicy! Spicy! The service is friendly and the restaurant usually gets full at peak hours. They have a long list of choices, most are big portions that come at an inexpensive price.   As an appetizer, the spicy green beans are perfect and very satisfying. It is definitely one of the restaurant's staple items! Their kung pao chicken is delicious, of course I hand-picked most of the chilis out of the dish as I literally thought I was going to pass out at one point, and even then the chicken had absorbed more than enough spice... but apart from the spicy punch, I loved it. And I'll still give it a great rating, because that's true szechuan for you!   Get ready to sweat.  Good tip: Order a beer, it helps wash down the spiciness and it's more successful than water!"}
{"text":"I looked over the yelp reviews for this place and decided to try it out. We were a table of 4 and tried 6 different dishes. None of them were particularly amazing, both in flavours and size. 2 of our dishes were odd tasting compared to what they traditionally taste like. Overall a bit of a disappointment as the price was a bit over your usual Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here, ordered the boiling fish, twice cooked pork, spicy wontons, string beans, and cabbage.   I would say the spice levels were a bit lacking, could've been spicier for everything. The wontons were pretty disappointing. I enjoyed the boiling fish and string beans though."}
{"text":"When you're hung over you usually turn to something greasy to help you recover. Instead of going for burgers and fries I decided to try something different.  Orders a wonton soup which was flavourless. The wontons weren't made with love.  Peanut butter dumplings had a sorta spicy peanut butter sauce which made it stand out compared to most super sweet ones I've had. The wontons were flavourless same as the soup. They added a few green onions to make it look better then it actually was.   My friend got the general Tao spicy and nothing to go gaga over. The chicken and spinach wasn't good and in my personal experience the spinach should be crispy not soggy.  All and all I can't say I loved it or hated it. It's a 5 on 10.   = in every plate"}
{"text":"The flavors were good, the service was freindly and the place was extremely clean compared to US Szechuan places.  I was expecting tears-and-snot-spicy, but the tofu flower chicken was \"white person\" spicy, (not at all spicy by equatorial standards).    My main complaint was the chicken....it looked like chicken, had the texture of (tough) chicken, but had that gamey 'thrice cooked' chicken taste that mad it completely inedible."}
{"text":"We turned up at 7ish as a party of 8, which was just the right time because it was full half an hour later. We decided to each order a dish and share, and it ended up being way too much food. My two favourites:  - sweet and sour pork, which I was not looking forward to, imagining it would be deep-fried, sweet and sticky à la cantonnaise, but which was succulent and served with a subtle and delicious sauce to complement not drown it;  - the spicy pork intestine and noodle soup, which I would have liked to order but didn't think my party wanted to share, but which one brave soul did take and no-one liked but me - it was so tender, the spiciest dish we ate, and the noodles were the thick, doughy, udon type that didn't get soggy, even when I had them for the following day's lunch.  The one dish that disappointed was the cumin-fried chicken. It was dry and gristly. Otherwise, everything was great.  Yes, the decor is sparse, but you expect that from most Chinese restaurants. The service was extremely prompt and the prices more than reasonable, and I am definitely going back with all my friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've eaten here lots, and it's where we bring all our visitors to Montreal who enjoy those amazing Szechuan flavours.  I've been out of town for a while and admit I was a bit worried when I saw some of those recent one star reviews. Maybe things had changed? But when all those one-star reviewers admit that they are there for General Tao chicken, or surprised when rice doesn't come in an ice cream scoop ball on the plate with your meal - well, you know how seriously to consider those comments.  If you want to experience Szechuan tastes, why don't you try something you've never had, like pork in home garlic sauce (find this in the list of cold appetizers). Over to the vegetable dishes, isn't it interesting to find potatoes on the menu? Give the hot and sour potatoes with chili a try, you will be surprised - they are grated into small sticks with the mandolin and barely cooked, so retain their crunch, and while the sauce is vinegary, oily and mildly spicy, the dish remains light and delicate. The green beans with pork are better than anywhere. Lastly, the thing we were astounded by on our first visit - either one of the two fish dishes in Szechuan peppercorn broth. The fish comes floating in an enormous bowl of broth covered with chopped red chilis. You'll want to avoid eating these. The peppercorns themselves can be overwhelming if you eat too many (hot and aromatic), but dig around for the fish and other goodies in the bowl (tofu / bean sprouts / peanuts), and let the broth infuse your rice and gobble that up afterwards. The special plus of this dish is you can pull out a hunk of fish at the end of your meal and it's still burning hot from the broth. We always want to get cumin chicken, too, but feel like we are overdoing it if we get more than four dishes for two people.  Glad this place is still around, still busy, still delicious."}
{"text":"Totally like being in northern China! Westerns beware this is not Chinese American Szechuan! It's\"s Hot, it's\"s soupy and it's all oily. It's a perfect way to warm up here. Despite the other review, not to chew and eat the Szechuan flower peppercorns will leave you without the truly special experience! They taste of licorice, spice, citrus, and flowers and then make your tongue tingle and go numb. They totally are the crack in the pot!    I was totally flushed with color like I had been at the beach all day when I left ! Enjoyed dumplings in chili sauce and beef and tofu pot. Nothing like toting a fire in the belly for the long cold walk back to the hotel!"}
{"text":"My theory that there are only 3 places (California, New York, Boston) in the Western Hemisphere to get good Chinese food is holding up.  Everything was SOO salty!  The chili \"chicken\" was delicious, but the tiny chunks of \"chicken\" were about 80% bone.  Please rename this dish to chili chickenbone.    The seafood soup was fairly bland but they were generous with the shrimp and fish.  It's what we needed on a freezing cold, snowy night.  I just wish they gave us some soy sauce or something to jazz it up."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Delicious delicious.   We had the black pepper beef and an eggplant dish (stewed in lots of oil, sweet yet spicy). Both were incredibly flavourful. Hot & sour soup was one of the best we've had, and we tend to try it at all szechuan places we visit. This place was clearly a step above any other. Great quality, would love to go back and try many more dishes!!  We were glad to see that the patrons were very mixed, with at least half the restaurant being chinese. i think that's a good sign!"}
{"text":"Lived 5 min from this place, came here many times. If you like spicy this is your place! Good quality food, not your typical Chinese. The hot and sour soup here is the best, spicy fish soup, gongbau chicken, and broccoli beef are my favorites! Def a go for Szechuan lovers!"}
{"text":"What refreshing, unique, Hot food! Excellent! Based on reviews I found online, I walked from my hotel, Le Cantlie on Sherbrooke West and ordered a carryout of cumin beef, steamed fish in chili sauce and hot and sour soup. All were great!!!! All unique! The entrees were spicey hot and the soup an unusual version of the hot and sour soup I know in the States. Highly recommend! Any negative reviews about the decor or cleanliness are malicious, it's clean and casual. They do take debit cards. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Love their fish stew and green beans sautéed. I used to eat here once or twice per week when I lived in down town. Now too much if a hassle to drive in downtown. Awesome food at least most of the ones I've tried. I have so many Chinese friends so they always ordered the best and most authentic ones for me. Love this place"}
{"text":"The food is simply great, been here numerous times, never been disappointed. Fabulous spiced green beans, eggplant, chicken & beef dishes... can't remember all the names. The cleanliness of the place is another matter.... the walls are dirty and speckled with food the previous patrons left behind. A good scrub -down would NOT hurt. The bathroom, ALWAYS has a pool of water near the toilet . PLEASE have the toilet/plumbing fixed! Service is prompt if perfunctory.The atmosphere is  lively and always busy, you might not feel very comfortable just sitting and relaxing after you've eaten because new patrons keep arriving and need to be seated."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I went to on my recent trip to Montreal.  I went there because I had been dying for hot pot, and boy did I get it!  IT was just about all I could ask for.  And it may seem strange to go to an Asia restaurant first thing in Montreal, but when you are jonesing for something real, authentic and good you just got to scratch the itch.  It is small, and semi below street level but easy enough to find.  I just sat down, told the waitress that I heard you have great hot pot and that is what I wanted.  She said \"are you sure, it is really hot\"  And I just looked her in the eye and told her I'm an adventurous eater and I'm not scared of Szechuan food.  She suggested some of the cucumber salad as a side dish to help cool the heat, which sounded good.  Shortly we got the salad and some beers.  The salad looks like it should be one fire, as the chunks (and I mean chunks) of cucumber were swimming in an oily spicy looking sauce.  but when you tasted it, there was a hint of mild chili, some garlic and then a bit of sweet that was very cooling.  Then the big hot pot showed up.  Brimming with good things.  The burner was turned on and we sat back to wait while it came to a boil.  You could see the Szechuan pepper corns amidst the meat, veggies, wood ear, tofu, bean sprouts and other goodies.  A large heaping pile of chilies was on top as well.  IT was hot, it was good, it was tingly.  This is one of the few times I've felt a full body endorphin rush from eating.  Three or four bits followed by the cucumber was perfect.  The meat was supper tender and yummy.   The tofu took on a great falvor from the hell broth.  The bean sprouts were one of the best things and I'm not a big bean sprout person.  I know why now people become addicted to this dish.    Watching what others around us were eating, a lot of things looked really good and I wish I was going to be able to get try more of what they have to offer but maybe next trip.    When we were paying the bill (very reasonable btw) the waitress asked us if we had anything like this back home, and I exclaimed \"no nothing like it, no where even close to this good.\"  We'll be back.  That is for sure.  She also asked us where we had heard about it, being in an out of the way place by Concordia University and being there on vacation.  She didn't know they were on Yelp!  Go Yelpers in Montreal go there, check in and eat their hot pot.  YOu'll feel the tingle and become addicted."}
{"text":"Really, really good and more or less reasonably priced authentic szechuan food.  Good, especially if you're in the area: as a McGill student I go here all the time with friends.  Be prepared to wait in line a little on weekend nights though because there isn't a tonne of seating."}
{"text":"I love their fish soup with vegetables (bean sprouts) - Menu number 110. only $13 and feeds 3 people. Very generous portion. The most tasty food in the world!!"}
{"text":"We ordered General Tao, some veggies and rice using the Just Eat delivery service. Worst idea ever. It took over an hour and a half to get here, and the General Tao was soggy and flavourless upon arrival. The veggies were also pretty lacklustre. It's a shame because I've eaten there before and their lamb hot pot is actually really good. I wouldn't recommend taking out from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good.   Price is right.  Location is good.   They speak english well.   The only this to watch for are the slippery floors."}
{"text":"I am visiting Montreal and haven't tried any other Chinese places around here yet, but I really did not expect to find such good Asian food here. I ordered the twice-cooked pork, a Szechuan staple. It wasn't as spicy (ma-la, tongue-numbing spice) as the real thing, and they weren't using Asian leeks. This version had onions, bell peppers, and Chinese celery. Despite the differences, I really enjoyed it and thought the flavor was on-point. The pork belly slices were actual pork belly, while many Chinese restaurants in the West just use whatever cut of pork they use for ever other dish. Really exceeded my expectations! Unless all Chinese food in Montreal is this good, I really think this place deserves more attention.  I'm half Chinese, grew up in Asia, and I was introduced to the one of my favorite dishes ever, twice-cooked pork, during a stay in Beijing. From that point onwards I've used this dish as a metric by which to measure Chinese restaurants in the west, when they offer it. Although it's a Szechuan dish, my understanding is that it's quite common fare throughout China, but it doesn't seem to have caught on in the west as much yet. Note: I also despise most Americanized Asian food. And I don't often care about service quality."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of different meals here and I've never been disappointed. It is tasteful and pretty cheap. The service is fine, not great but more than acceptable. If you want to try good and authentic chinese food I really recommand."}
{"text":"Ordered in through JustEat last night. The food was hot and delivered within 25 minutes, it was just what I needed and the portions are HUGE - lasted me three whole meals! I had the Gong Bao Chicken with peanuts (yummy!) and the wanton soup (decent enough). Warning: you need to get rice separately since the dishes don't come with them. And they only accept cash for delivery (which is why I used JustEat)!"}
{"text":"I don't go there again...food was not delicious and from frozen....no taste and almost feel sick after we went there."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  If you crave authentic Sichuan food then this is the best I've had in Montreal.   As compared to Sichuan food in China, it's definitely milder.   You get the flavor of the sichuan pepper corns but not a lot of numbing.  And a reduced burn level.   But for local tastes, I think they have struck a good balance.   If you've never tried real Sichuan food but you do like it spicy ... then give this place a try."}
{"text":"The rice was good. Everything else was less than stellar. We ordered the General Tao's chicken. It was decent, but it was too spicy for our taste buds. The service was terrible. The restaurant was crowded; they struggled to seat people, there were major delays in service, and they struggled to communicate with some monolingual French clients.   I wasn't completely dissatisfied until it was time to pay the bill. I gave the server the exact amount on the bill and she shoved the bill in my face. \"This only include tax, no tip include in bill, you didn't pay tip.\" It is incredibly rude to ask for a tip - one I was going to give her anyway. I ended up tipping her, but I encourage others to perhaps not go here anymore... or better yet, go but don't tip her."}
{"text":"Not much more to add here; excellent Food, ok prices, in a dumpy setting. I'll be back though, to try out more menu items. All in all way above the average Montreal Chinese Resto."}
{"text":"GROS COUP DE COEUR pour ce resto! Ça faisait un moment que mon chum m'en parlait à quel point c'était un bon resto et j'ai finalement décidé de me joindre à lui un midi pour dîner.  En entrée, une soupe Aigre doux pour lui et une wonton pour moi. Sa soupe était délicieuse, la mienne manquait un peu de goût et de viande dans les wonton. Pas assez pour enlever une étoile par contre!   Étant un habitué mon chum savait déjà ce qu'il voulait. Le porc aux champignons noirs. Une fois que tu es passé par dessus la texture visqueuse des champignons, c'est vraiment bon.. la sauce, les épices, le porc, tout!  Moi, j'étais obligée de goûter au Général Tao, parce que j'aime ça, bon. WOW, je dois dire que c'est probablement le meilleur Général Tao que j'aie mangé. EVER!  Finalement, vu qu'on voulait des restants pour souper + goûter à plus de plats, le serveur nous a recommandé de regarder derrière le menu... les spécialités du chef. Nous avons pris le porc fumé au bamboo. Il a installé un petit rond au propane sur notre table, et amené un petit wok avec le mélange, sur un lit d'onions crus avec un million de chili peppers. My my que c'était épicé, mais j'étais juste incapable d'arrêter d'en manger!  Tout ça plus un gros bol de riz pour 63$ incluant le pourboire. Je considère ça pas mal raisonnable.  Je recommande définitivement!!!  Note: Jeff Molson mange là... tsé!"}
{"text":"We ordered food to take away. Here is my two cents -  - Dan Dan noodles were excellent!  - Stir fried chicken with broccoli was great. - Tea tree mushroom and chicken was soup was pathetic.  - We received an extra mushroom and chicken soup when we had only ordered one. That too a large one despite being told small. That can really do good if they get careful about to-go side. Overall good!"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Montreal. I think we've now eating here nearly 20 times. I think that if this restaurant ever left the city I would leave with it lol no but really I'd be sad and have an empty hole in my heart. I adore the people who work here, they are amazingly sweet, it's just so authentic you can't go wrong if you know what real Szechuan should taste like - and if you don't know, the girls will help you choose wisely."}
{"text":"For Americanized Chinese food, really not bad at all, but I wish we had gone a few blocks further over to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Very pleasant service, good food, very good soup and beef and broccoli!  Rice was one clump though and I really like well cooked rice.  Will def come back!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for some spicy authentic Sichuan food? Here's the place to go! It has a very extension menu and I highly recommend the Fried Spicy Sichuan Chicken and the Spicy Beef stew. It can get quite spicy so make sure you ask for less spice if you can't take it.   This is a cozy small restaurant that is very casual. It's at the basement level so don't miss the entrance! Good service and they do take out as well. Go check it out if you want spicy sichuan food."}
{"text":"One of the best mapo tofu I've had in Montreal!! I asked for the order without pork and it tasted excellent! Not overly spicy but perfectly seasoned!  Wasn't overly salty like many places make it... Anyways! I also had their salt n pepper shrimp. Good, not the thing I recommend on their menu. Ask them for what they recommend! Super nice ladies. One of them even gave me water while I was waiting on my order. How adorable :) will return."}
{"text":"It's fine...I'm sure it's a standout for szechuan in this city, and maybe even for Chinese food in general.  However, it's becoming very obvious that this is just not a particularly discerning or interested szechuan-eating town.  Which is fine!  I know there's a lot of good food here, just not this kind.  The menu was pretty limited, and the flavors were executed in a merely ok fashion.  Dan Dan noodles were fine, but the whole brothiness of the dish (which is apparently common in Montreal detracts.  Also it was very light on meat.).  The Fish in spicy broth with tofu tasted like it had been seasoned with hot sauce, which doesn't belong in this dish.  It overwhelmed the other flavors and made the dish very one note.  The beef with shallot wasn't good.  The beef wasn't cut properly, so that it didn't chew well, and the dish was made with overly stewed onions.  It really isn't the worst food you've ever had - it's ok, and it's not entirely crazy to think I might order from them again.  It's just kinda sad that this might be the best that Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"I've been there several times right before they close. They always welcome us even though it was closing time. The service was fast and the food was mouth numbing good.  The spice is what makes this restaurant so good. It's not spicy spicy but flavorful spicy. Expect to sweat because 90% of their dishes are super spicy (and good).  The price is always right. We go in group and share everything, and it comes to 10-12$ per person."}
{"text":"This is it folks Spicy Szechuan at its best. Its been a while since I've been here last, but from what I can remember thei food portions were huge. So order wisely. I usualy get their szeuchuan noodles, rice, this other item that I cant really remember atm, and also on occasions some nice yummy cow stomach. Not gross, you dont really smell anything much and the meat is nice and tender. The flavors are incredible plus the prices decent so you can come really anytime.   On the flavours itself the food is not at all oily from what Im used to and the staff is always accomodating to your tastes buds. As great on the eyes you even can smell the soulness and the quality never fails. They are mostly honest with their menus, so you can tell them about any of your allergies including MSG. They will patiently try to make the experience as less trouble free as possible.  The staff is moderately friendly, and service really on time. This is great for a group of 4, for good interaction or even couples who want little time together enjoying over good food. I always leave with a big stomach so come with a good apetite. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I think they have been changing their chef regularly because the taste is not staying the same. Sometime they offer very genuine spicy szechuan dishes and sometimes not. I was very disappointed last time I visited. The portion was no good. We two people order 4 dishes, what's left was not worth to pack, because of the portion and the taste."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with couple friends. The food was pretty descent and the quantity is very generous. I wouldn't probably travel far to come here but if you are in the area and crazing Szechuan food, you should check it out."}
{"text":"It can be a little salty sometimes but overall it is my favourite Chinese place in the city.  I am a big fan of the cumin beef and that is what I usually get.  The hot and sour soup is also really good!  Most of the food here is very spicy as lots of the dishes come loaded with chili peppers so if you have a low spice tolerance this is not the place to go.  Also note that the place is cash only too."}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Ordered tofu with shredded beef. Beef is just too thick and not tender enough to chow. Spicy broth is just so so."}
{"text":"This place offer discount coupon&combo on internet. 27$ for 3 plats and 2 small bowls of rice for two person. I would say it's PERFECT for a couple. Even enough for 3 or 4 people together. Really Really nice.  Only thing I don't like is it's not very spicy. I would love if it can be more spicy. Also lot of oil."}
{"text":"Great value. Had the chef's special fish (I believe that it was called Gong Bao, different than Kung Pao ). Spicy, as you would expect yet still great flavor.  Huge portions. Not fancy by any means by still very good food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good nothing spectacular but the server was nice. Hovever, this place had possibly one of the worst chinese food I've been to. Hot n sour soup tasted like vinegar... I have had a lot of hot n sour soup in my life but never tasted anything like this... String beens were too grown didn't have the right texture nor was is spiced right. Kung pao shrimp had a pretty good sauce but the shrimps were most likely frozen nd old. Mao po tofu was ok Maybe Americanized chinese menus are ok... but the morr authentic menus were pretty bad... I've eaten a lot of Chinese food around the world and this might be one of the memorable ones in terms of bad taste. The Kung Pao shrimp and string beens could have been better with better ingredients, but that hot n sour was a big no no"}
{"text":"They made mistakes on every part of our order and when we called, they denied it was their fault and would only bring the right food if we paid 20$ minimum for an order.  They are not reputable.  Suggest you stay away.  Side note, what they brought had no taste... Hope they go out of business - it's embarassing to Montreal."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered this for the first time today after finding it here on Yelp. We saw the reviews and figured it would be a decent meal. Overall, it wasn't outstanding but it did the trick.   We ordered the cumin beef, Kung Pao chicken and two servings of shrimp fried rice. We probably over ordered and the food was a bit much. For those four dishes, the total came to around $50.   -The cumin beef was something we hadn't tried before, and it was pretty good.  -The Kung Pao chicken was probably better and a bit more flavourful.  -The shrimp fried rice was lacking taste but the servings were generous.  I'm not sure I'd order from here again (given there are plenty of oriental alternatives in Montreal) but it really wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"How do I know this is legit Szechuan cuisine? Unlike at some restaurants, the hot peppers used here are mild and flavorful, rather than overwhelmingly spicy, so each dish is filled with peppers and red oil, but are packed with distinguishable flavors.   As usual, this review focuses on the szechuan/chinese part of the menu. I simply don't bother with General Tao chicken, beef and chinese brocoli, and such wannabe chinese takeout dishes.  Mapo tofu: Spicy, but not setting tastebuds on fire spicy. Good texture tofu, can definitely taste the tingling sensation of sichuan peppercorns. Lacks a bit of minced pork in my opinion, but otherwise has a subtle and delicious finishing (after the spicy, salty, you taste other flavors)  Poached fish in chili oil: Again, spicy but not overwhelming. Tingling-lemony sensation due to sichuan peppercorns. Smokey/toasty taste in both broth and fish due to toasted dried red peppers. Amazing aftertaste. Broth is also packed with flavor so I drink it despite the red chili oil.  Will come back for more szechuan dishes. And will definitely recommend to people who wants to experience an authentic szechuan (sichuan) dinner."}
{"text":"I really disliked this place. I ordered the fried chicken, which came in small pieces that had been chopped up WITH THE BONE IN. This meant that every bite required you to pick small pieces of bone and gristle out of your mouth. Mediocre service, cash and debit only, and the decor is 80's diner."}
{"text":"So driving down Guy street I noticed this Szechuan restaurant and had to try it.  Ordered the Beef soup, fried beans, noodles and dumplings. I must warn that I spend 3 months a year in china and that most people rating this place has probably not been to china. I know Szechuan food and this was far from the real thing. The one which came close was the beef soup. Not spicy and only a small hint of peppercorn, 4 star for this. Fried beens was not even close to the real thing but for montreal a 3 star!!! Noodles were like plain noodles. OK if I ordered them but I ordered the Szechuan noodles which should have peppercorns coming threw my nose. None here!!! 3 star for that and that was high!! Finally the dumplings!!! GROSS!!! WTF they serve frozen dumplings which you buy at the grocery stare!!! Big shit they give you 18 of them. Its $6.99 for a complete bag at the corner store and even fast better at the house. 1 star for this crap!! Over all very disappointing. KanBai in chinatown is much better.  Oh the canada dry ginger ale was pretty good. 5 star for that!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  We walked by it every week and there is always a full house, so we decided to try it.  We ordered the Ma po tofu, the sweet eggplant, cumin chicken, green beans, the famous spicy boiled fish and the spareribs.  The food was good, but a bit greasy (typical chinese food). The mapo tofu was the only thing i didn't enjoy, it didn't taste very authentic.  The fish was amazing though.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome Szechuan  Ryk recommended this years ago and we finally got to try it.  We had their specialty, a fish in a broth of peppers with tofu and crispy eggplant.    Pretty spicy, very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Listen, I don't even know what I ate here, but I can tell you that I dream about it! ...Well, that 's not entirely true. I do remember that we ordered the Fried Cumin Chicken (or was it Cumin Fried Chicken?Fried chicken w/Cumin???). Anyway the name doesn't matter! It was succulent, hot pieces of crispy fried chicken buried under a blanket of cumin. And we got an eggplant dish, something to the tune of Xiang Dong Eggplant (it was a long a** name. I don't know it. I'm sorry. I saw chinese eggplant and I was like \"Yes please!\")  And I had a plan. I was only going to have one maybe two pieces of the chicken and try to load up on veggies. I mean a girl does have to watch her figure and I couldn't hit the clubs later feeling greasy fingered and fat! No way! Well, the chefs at Cuisine Szechuan blew my plan out of the water because after one bite of that food, a sinking feeling came over me. I remember looking at the heaping dishes in front of me and half-thinking/calmly emoting \"F*** a plan.\" My chopsticks had a mind of their own and they just kept pulling glorious morsels of eggplant and chicken into my rice bowl. Even my friend who is a picky eater and doesn't eat a lot of Asian cuisine couldn't stop eating!   Well, needless to say we wrecked havoc on that food and stuffed ourselves good and proper. The food is amazing! I would absolutely come here again and it's not that far from the clubs on Rue Crescent (Crescent Street for you anglophones). Okay it's probably a ten minute walk, but you need to circulate your blood and wake up from the food coma before you start drinking yourselves silly."}
{"text":"I am so very happy to report, I returned again to try new dishes and I can once again say WOW this time I tried the following Wonton ,one other yelper, mentioned it was better than the usual fair, and I agree it was very tasty and far more interesting Gong Bao Chicken with peanuts -excellent again, a very nice heat to it, and again with the maple flavor, which to me was very tasty, the whole peanuts are a great way to add an interesting texture to each mouthful Twice cooked pork ,this was just good for my taste, the pork was a little more fatty than I liked, but the sauce and veggies it came with were good Shrimp special of the day , I loved the flavor and the portion was huge for just 18$, the only down side for me is that this is head on unpeeled shrimps so it is a messy mess, and difficult to eat especially while trying to avoid the deadly mounds of peppers and heaven forbid you should touch your eyes for any reason we reordered the sweet and sour ribs....a new no brainer so good the veggie if the day -chinese broccoli, just as good as last time  New tips: I asked if they use msg, and they said they could make our order without, the only dish we could not get without it was the sweet and sour soup, so be sure to mention any allergies you may have as they are very considerate of these needs and can help guide your selection, also they only take cash and debit no credit cards  Happy moment: being asked to take a seat while I wait for take out, having a waitress bring me some water while I wait, having the very nice waitress take the time to describe the dishes, and hearing the kitchen staff singing while they worked in the kitchen....aww to feel good moments of life, I'm sold on this place!!"}
