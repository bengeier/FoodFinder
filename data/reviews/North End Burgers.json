{"text":"They always make the best burgers. Completely encourage going there. A nice little place to go for burgers"}
{"text":"Best in Whitby. Large portions and good value."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place-but the food did not live up to the expectations. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Johnny's occupies a good little market niche. Its WAY better food than a fast-food chain. Its also almost 50% cheaper than a signature burger joint (the works, five guys). and a stronger option than starr burger up the street.  Its a neighborhood hangout, and having friends up on the walls also provides some hilarious memories."}
{"text":"The food is like my rating, A-OK. The portions are large and I've personally never finished an entire meal... which was $5... Cheese Burger with pickles/mustard/relish/ketchup, fries and a Coke. (I hate not finishing meals tho, so that says something) The environment is okay, if you're a hockey fan, and that is where customer service comes in... Johnny (\"The Burger Nazi\"... from what I've been told... several times) is not a very pleasant man to be around or talk to (unless you have hockey gear on, he knows you play hockey, or knows you at all). If you don't have the typical hockey swag or have anything different from a Bauer cap and a Sidney Crosby Reebok shirt, he may just shun you off. *Time to retire?...  Experience: (Back in the day i had long hair and a skateboard in my hand, i was the only person at his counter, i only wanted onion rings and he said i should leave. I've also seen him yell at a little girl for changing her mind from wanting a chicken burger to then wanting a hamburger after the order was filled. She was around 6-7 years old. Disrespectful.)  Choose STARR BURGER if you want a large meal, for a good price, and a free, honest smile. (Down the street, north, passed the railway bridge)  The 3 stars go towards the food, nothing else."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries you are going to find. Fantastic service, the owner is the uncle of an NHL hockey player and the stanley cup has been filled with HIS gravy and these fries have been dipped!"}
{"text":"The food's ok. Nothing extravagant, and with all the other great burger joints around nowadays, its really nothing to write home about. Average, ok taste, etc.   The service though? Completely different story. Johnny (or the likes of that old jerk) has no business working in an industry that requires any form of customer service. I understand that he's been around for a long time and has established a good customer base over the years, etc, but try going  into a place  that offers great food and even better customer service and is actually welcoming instead of North End where you are treated like dirt just because old Johnny thinks he can (and because he's been allowed to get away with it for all these years). Move over with your piss poor nasty attitude Johnny! Shake Rabble and Roll, and even Pete's Big Bite blow  you right out of the water (food-wise, and service-wise). With all the local competitors we have now, an attitude adjustment should be considered."}
{"text":"Great burgers and excellent service would recommend this to any burger lover beats any franchise burger all day long"}
{"text":"Super large home-made burgers and larger than life poutines. Owner is a hockey fan without a doubt. How would I know -- just get inside and you'll know why ! :-)"}
{"text":"The fresh toppings on the bacon cheeseburger served on a toasted bun along with a generous portion of fries satisfied my taste buds.  For those who are hockey fans, the restaurant is decorated with a vast amount of memorabilia."}
{"text":"Don't go here looking for ambience - this place is a dive! But what's better than a divey burger joint?  The service is friendly and portion sizes are generous.  The burgers are great and the fries are even better! The only criticism is the buns are much too big for the patties.   We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My review is based on my 2 experiences at North end burger.   First off , the food is alright, not amazing, but better than any fast food you will get.   saying that, I will never go there again, because of a very rude and ignorant staff member that's always working. He answers the phone very rudely. speaks ignorant, like he has no time for you or your order. (guess what d*uche you work there)  when you see him in the store he is the same way. I couldn't believe the service I received today at lunch. I didn't realize me picking up my food was such an inconvenience for them. so I will take my business elsewhere   this one guy (he is fat and wears a Yankees cap) has made me swear this place off.   several people from my work have also commented on how much of a d*ck that guy is. .. and a couple others wont go there either, which is a shame because its around the corner from my work.  So whoever owns johnny burgers, You are losing more than several customers due to your a-hole of an employee."}
{"text":"My manager recommended this place to me when I told her I was heading out to Whitby for the weekend.  I'm glad she did.  Turns out, North End Burgers is about a fifteen minute walk from my girlfriend's place, so we headed over to this place. It's in a small trip plaza, just north of what would be considered Whitby's \"downtown\".  The prices are very good. Your average hamburger is $3.50, cheeseburger is a bit more, banquet burger a bit more than that, etc. I had a cheeseburger with a poutine; my girlfriend had a hamburger with fries.  Sitting in the back room, the walls are adorned with a random assortment of NHL memorabilia. Toronto Maple Leafs, OHL teams, autographed pictures, classic pictures, former athletes such as Doug Gilmour, Wendel Clark. As a big hockey fan, it was fun to see all these old pictures, newspaper clippings, posters.  The food was ready in just a few minutes, when the cook yelled out our order. I'll agree with one of the other reviews here; the chef, who I can only assume is Johnny based on his demeanour and the description afforded in the other review, is not very sociable. He was to the point, blunt, and very monotone.  However, I'm okay with that. Would you rather have a cook who talks to you, is nice, friendly, and cooks a meh burger? Or would you rather have someone who is off-putting and considered rude, but makes one hell of a burger? I'll go with the latter.  The food was outstanding. The fries were fresh, the gravy was very smooth and very good, and the burger was cooked perfectly with a very soft bun.  I will definitely be going back to this place, any time I'm in Whitby and need to kill time before meeting up with my girlfriend. It's that good.  *That* good."}
{"text":"Good burgers and love all the hockey mementos all around the place"}
{"text":"Great service, great food for a great price. You won't leave here hungry. Love the decor."}
{"text":"Johnny burger, the place that keeps you coming back. The crazy low prices are just a bonus after trying their food. To be honest, all I've had are the poutine and hamburger. I can't try anything else without wanting that delicious burger.   My boyfriend and I always order the same thing. The special with poutine, a hamburger and another pop. We've ordered 2 specials with poutine before and neither of us could finish. The hamburger is flavourful and juicy. They do not skimp on toppings. They have expanded the variety of toppings lately with a convenient list at the till. The fries, gravy and cheese are always plentiful.   The restaurant itself is a hockey lover's dream. It's covered, top to bottom, with various hockey memorabilia, newspaper articles and many signed articles. It's nice to see someone not only enjoy the NHL, but also appreciate the local teams and players. No matter where you sit, there is something hockey to check out."}
{"text":"First time to this amazingly nostalgic place.. Had a twin cheeseburger and fries with gravy.. Burger was really good and sloppy and cheesy... Really good value... Fries were a bit bland and the gravy tasted a bit burnt. Overall a good lunch though.. Great place to read about hockey history."}
{"text":"Great food!  Johnny's North End Burgers is nearly identical to another place in Oshawa called Mr. Burger in terms of their food.  Johnny's has great burgers, fries and homemade onion rings.  The place is covered in hockey paraphernalia, Johnny screams out when your food is ready and asks you to go behind the counter to get your drinks.  Very cool!"}
{"text":"Great service with amazing burgers. They gave me onion rings even though I never asked because it was my first time. Great food, service and amazing prices"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of John's since he had West Lynne Burger in the Late 70's early 80's and he always puts out a good product along with some Soup Nazi thrown in!  Burgers are factory made and very popular (very similiar to a Harvey's Burger) but the Steak on a Kaiser is handcut and my personal favourite.  If you are a Hockey fan..well it is literally a hockey Museum and you can even see pictures of Joe Neuwendiuk eating fries and Gravy out of the Stanley cup when he brought it in ...  A Whitby Landmark and always great value :)"}
{"text":"$9 got me a bacon cheeseburger combo with fries, gravy and a pop. Very soft bun, big patty, and fresh toppings. Portion was large and very filling. Definitely a recommend."}
{"text":"Just wanted to have a good old time milkshake and a snack.  Milk shakes suck here all watery and not thick at all.  Service is kinda cranky too. Onion rings were a little over fried.  That said I think most people come for the burgers so I'm sure they are good."}
{"text":"Great food and comes at a cheap price. There service is definitely fast and they're super friendly. I made a mistake one order and they responded with the note below and they didn't charge me any extra. I highly recommend ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place is a 5* for Hockey artificacts and memorabilia alone.  Had the burger and steak sandwich.   The burger was average. Not bad, not great.  The steak sandwich was excellent.  Ambience: typical Greek diner.  From one end of the province to the other, it seems like all the Greek diners got together in the 70s and said: hey, this is how it's going to be.  Worth a drop in, if you're passing by."}
