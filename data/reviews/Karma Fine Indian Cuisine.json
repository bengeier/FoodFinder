{"text":"I don't really think there's much to add than what has already been noted in these reviews. The interior decor is nicer than your average East Indian restaurant. The food is quite pricey for what you get, and I thought the portion size was pretty minimal. The food itself was tasty, however, I expected a bit more \"kick\" from the dishes. The only spicy dish was the vindaloo, so I'd recommend asking them for some heat if that's what you like."}
{"text":"We picked Karma based on all the great reviews; didn't enjoy as much as everyone else.   Decor was very nice, service really friendly and the best item was the naan. However everything else was very westernized; almost seemed like frozen Superstore product reheated. Sorry but it wasn't very authentic, McDonald's of Indian cuisine.   Unfortunately the naan bread is not enough to come back again."}
{"text":"Great option in the South for Indian food if you don't feel like going far from home.  I've always found the food to be good, if a little over priced.  If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday be sure to make a reservation.  Even with a reservation you may still wait though.  They tend to seat people at reserved tables and tell them they need to be out by the time the reservation arrives, and of course, your table is still being used when you get there."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The service is great. Even the owners are friendly and polite.  My favourite restaurant in the SE by far!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Karma numerous times in the last few years. My first few visits were fantastic, the food was full of flavor and the portions were reasonable for the price. The lamb there has always been fantastic.  I've noticed lately though that the quality of food has gone down hill with attempts to cut back on cost by watering down chutneys and raita (cucumber yoghurt). At one point their raita was so watered down that it tasted like cucumber yoghurt in water and we had to ask the manager to take it back and make a better one. On my last visit to Karma i had the same experience with the tamarind chutney and raita again very watered down and lacked flavor. I probably would not go back again and would rather drive to downtown for more authentic indian food. I would have to agree with the reviewer that said that vindaloo is unreasonably spicy with no flavor (coming from a guy that has above average tolerance for spices)."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. Butter chicken is one of the best i have tasted.  Definitely satisfies the craving."}
{"text":"I was impressed with Karma after heading there for both lunch and dinner. The atmosphere is great with fantastic decor; the food is very good and with fair sized portions, and I would say fairly priced.   Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"One of the best East Indian food places in Calgary...  I was invited by one of my business colleagues for a lunch meeting at this place and since then I cannot resist having a lunch or dinner at Karma at least once a week.   The food is authentic, cooked to perfection and the service is great ! Pricing.. hmm compared to the food served is great as against some hyped out places around Calgary.  I would recommend a visit anytime to this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience, great service!! We tried the 2 types of butter chicken and it was Ah-maz-ing, Nan is one of the best I've ever tried.. I'm definitely a regular from now on!!"}
{"text":"Our first experience with Karma was fantastic!    We walked in without reservations and had to wait (which I don't mind).  We ordered non-vegetarian dinner - service was friendly, food tasted great, atmosphere was relaxed and we liked the pre-set menu allowing us to try their chicken, lamb and beef entrees.  Pricing was comparable to other restaurants we've visited for the quality and amount of food we received.  Everything tasted fresh, and we enjoyed the variety.  We will eat here again."}
{"text":"We visited this rest @ lunch and I was disappointed by the limited selection offered in the buffet.  No soups, no aloo gobi, no eggplant.  Instead, they had lots of nan, rice, potatoes, & (of course) butter chicken. I checked their take-out menu and Karma does sell two soups (lentil, mullgatawny) & lots of dishes with both cauliflower & eggplant?  Why does the buffet excludes the healthier menu offerings?  The buffet lunch for 4 ran $75 - pricey for the limited offerings!"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the lack of another Indian eatery in the area. While the overall ambience and service is fine, the food is just outrageously bad. I totally agree with the writer below who compares the curry to tomato soup. I ordered the Chicken Manchurian and ended up with 4 bite-sized pieces of chicken floating in what seemed like the sweet tomato pur√©e from a Costco can.   I can't see how they can remain in business for long without a returning clientele, and with the rubbish they serve, I am never going back.   Please get yourself a half-decent chef, Karma!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like this place, very comparable to the Indian restuarants downtown in regards to quality and price.  It can add up pretty quick when ordering a few drinks but if not, can usually be under $60-$70 for 2.  The ambiance is very nice and it is extremely clean.  Food wise, the butter chicken is my favorite although somewhat North Americanized and the lamb is great too.  Samosas, cocount rice, roti and everything else you could want.  Their carrot halva for dessert is a must, a favorite from my trip to India a few years ago."}
{"text":"We choose Karma time and time again for date nights. Great good, great service, prices are comparable. We've never had the buffet but have ordered the vegetarian dinner for two a few times. The amount of food in the dinner for two is ridiculous!! Both my husband and I have great appetites and we can never finish it. We love the leftovers ;) We've never been to India or claim to know what REAL Indian food is like but we've always enjoyed our meals! Great atmosphere when your out on a date but want to stay close to home for whatever reason.  Try the lentil soup!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian cuisine. They in my opinion should have a different price for children under 12  not lump all kids  Mediocre Indian food. They could have a better pricing policy, when it comes to children. As it stands under 12 is half price, and under 5 is $ 5.00. In my opinion kids under 12 should be a certain price, and my 3 yr. old which ate a scoop of rice should not be made to pay $5.00"}
{"text":"Karma is a great place for a date night! Cute, quiet atmosphere. The food is amazing and you get SO MUCH! Enough to take home yummy leftovers for lunch the next day. It's very vegetarian and vegan friendly! Just let them know and they have no problem accommodating. So happy with the service, the staff is very informed and helpful with unfamiliar items on the menu. All together a great experience! Definitely a must when visiting the Deep South area of Calgary! ESPECIALLY IF YOURE VEGAN!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at various Indian restaurants though out Calgary for many years and by far Karma is on top of my/ my families list. From the moment you step inside the restaurant you can just tell they've put a lot of effort in their high end decor and built an atmosphere which is very inviting; even their washrooms are exceptionally clean and well maintained.  As for their food; I've never had a bad experience. Their commitment to serving traditional family dishes keeps us coming back time and time again. Karma has wide variety of menu choices and they certainly cook them with care and attention. I'm always pleased and never felt they've given too little in their portion sizes. We all love the butter chicken!!  We've also taken advantage of their lunch buffet which is always a treat. They rotate some of the dishes which is nice to see. It's not the same old same old...... however their most popular are always present. My wife has even used Karma for catering lunches for 20 people and feedback was extremely positive.  Thanks Karma for great food and service. You'll see me again!!!"}
{"text":"Damn that shit's good.  Veggie samosas on point (get the minty green chutney with it), and slightly sweet, beautifully flavorful butter chicken that will haunt my dreams. All dishes we had here were great (though the khadai was kind of like an Asian sweet and sour stir fry? Not sure how I felt about that one), but the butter chicken will stay with me in heart and in mind.   Can't comment on value/portion size since I'd had their food at an event, but looking at their website it seems reasonable.  If I had a car, I would justify driving down here from downtown for that butter chicken (mmmmm). Absolutely would have their food again."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try something new and heard that karma was the place to go to for Indian food, so we decided to try it out. The staff were fast and our waitress was happy to answer all of our questions and give suggestions.  We were blown away by how great the food is, apparently you can get almost anything mild or spicy so even if you can't handle spice you can enjoy the food. (their Indian beer is really good too)! Definitely can't wait to go to karma again next weekend!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night not knowing what to expect.   The place was buzzing with a nice lively crowd. We were seated immediately even though we had no reservations! Ratio of waitresses to guests was perfect & we never felt neglected by our waitress Victoria! She was very attentive and brought everything to us in a timely manner. Kudos to the kitchen staff as well!!  The food was amazing and exceeded our expectations. The entire experience made us decide that we will definitely go back again.   A must try for all those Indian food lovers.

{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in South Calgary to visit for a nice evening out. Rav and his family do a wonderful job of serving delicious food, at good prices, for dine-in or takeout. The staff are always friendly, knowledgeable, speedy and make a point of connecting with their customers. The kitchen is also open to customer modifications, such as increasing the heat or even ordering dishes not on the menu, like Sag Aloo. The Nan bread, veggie samosas and Butter Chicken are my favourite items to order. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second time at Karma. Both times the food was absolutely amazing - 5 stars. The first time we had fantastic service as well - 5stars. Unfortunately, tonight the service was probably the worst we've had anywhere in Calgary.  We will keep coming back just for the food and hope we get the same attentive service we did during our first visit."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the city, I've been here a more than a few times and every time I've been the food has been spot on. The Butter chicken and the coconut chicken curry are two favourites."}
{"text":"Great food. The lamb was delicious. Great price point. No other comparable Indian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Have been here for both dinner and lunch buffet. Although the service is good and decor is nice, the food was okay. I found some dishes lacking flavour and was disappointed with the limited selection in the buffet. I also don't understand why they use food coloring in many of the dishes, including their so called saffron rice. This was confirmed by the staff."}
{"text":"We actually didn't originally intend to go there. The Keg was full and my husband was having a \"Snickers moment!!\"  So we saw Karma and decided to give it a shot!! Well as soon as we opened the door a delicious aroma filled our nostrils and senses!!!! The restaurant was packed which is always a good sign!!! The atmosphere was delightful!!! Very soft lighting. The staff was very friendly indeed!! We waited a little long for our food but it was busy and once we got it we understood!!! Everything was so fresh and tasty!!! We both had the lamb korma and garlic nan bread. We are definitely going back. I think we have found our new Indian restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. It's fancy Indian in a relaxing environment. The only downside is that it's a wee bit on the pricey side, but I would definitely come back to eat here.  Curry portions are definitely on the smaller side.  Make sure to order some naan and basmati rice!   We ordered the traditional butter chicken, shrimp vindaloo (OMG SPICY), aloo gobi, fish tikka, and other stuff. Butter chicken and fish tikka were sooooo good. Definitely get those.   Our server (Tatiana) was a total sweetheart. They do such a good job with making recommendations to balance out what you already have in addition to just being super nice.   Solid choice for Indian on this side of town."}
{"text":"Awesome! Some of the best Indian food I've had yet in Calgary. So far I've tried the pakoras, garlic naan, butter chicken, and their house special vegetable curry. We're just done take-out so far but would love to eat in the restaurant one of these days. A gem in the Deep South!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with Rich last Friday and the food, ambiance was AMAZING!  He had an indian beer and I had red wine to drink.  We ordered three indian dishes (butter chicken, another indian/thai fusion chicken dish, and a vegetarian dish), naan bread and samosas as an appetizer, and everything we had smelled and tasted absolutely delicous.  We ambiance is very classy and calm.  The meal was approximately $100 with drinks, and worth every single penny."}
{"text":"Food was decent but I feel the portion sizes aren't worth how much they charge for them. But it's hard to find good Indian food in this part of town, so it seems to be our go to when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"I went for the 11-2pm buffet. Very expensive for such a tiny buffet. I was disappointed"}
{"text":"Karma is the best!! Amazing, flavourful food, speedy service and lovely decor. The butter chicken is phenomenal!! Highly recommend going there! Kudos to the owner and his wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Dear lord what mind blowing food. We've eaten here twice in a week and cannot believe our luck this place is near our home.  Fresh, light, rich and flavourful; I have yet to eat Indian anywhere that is even comparable. Its the kind of food that makes you want to run into the kitchen just to hug and kiss everyone. The Butter Chicken is the BEST I have ever eaten and their naan is made fresh to order.   Just when you think it can't get any better, you find out there's a lunch buffet Mon-Sat from 11:30-2:00. Their food is the stuff dreams are made of and if you dont try this place, you are missing out. Me? Im planning on moving into their basement, so I can access leftovers when the restaurant is closed."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Try the traditional butter chicken. Had a small issue with our server but think she was having an off night. Everyone is entitled to those I guess. Prices were fair as well. Will defiantly go back"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I've been to a few Indian and Pakistani restaurants, had the absolute pleasure of eating authentic homemade Pakistani food and have cooked Pakistani food myself.  So when I go out for curry I mean business. I consulted yelp and it generated this gem: Karma.   The place itself is wonderfully designed and decorated. The server was attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant.  My cousin and I ordered vegetarian fishes as she is vegetarian. We had shai paneer, yellow daal, alloo ghobi, naan and roti. To start we had veggie pakora.  Aaaaand we wanted it hot. Everything was hot. Like  And flavourful. The aloo gobi was a little lacklustre; but not in the area of hot. So all I could taste was Indian red pepper.  The pakora was perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The chutneys were both well done.  If you want a nice romantic dinner enjoying authentic and delicious Indian cuisine in a relaxed but business casual atmosphere, this is the place."}
{"text":"Karma is a small, trendy place that gets a lot of attention from the area: we reserved a table for 12, but in the end only 9 arrived, so the waitress had to remove a table to use for a separate party, and to make space, our long table was squeezed against the wall.  Strike one! In a clear attempt to squeeze-'em-in-and-turn-'em-around, the restaurant neglected to leave us space to maneuver. We were on the bench against the wall, and it was basically \"good luck\" if you had to get to the washroom and ask four other people to squeeze over on the bench (into the next table's space). Room is tight, and even getting the four people to get up and come around the table to stand (in a line) hovering over the adjacent tables, would have been a considerable challenge. Jovi and Kat, sitting in the corner, had to resort to crawling under the table to get out. Very unrefined of the place, they would highly benefit from having a few less tables...  ...and a bit more effort in food preparation. Our appetizers were good (though Kat found severe fault with the vegetable samosas, calling them unworthy), and because we were nine people ordering over a dozen dishes, a couple seemed to have inevitably been lost and the dilemma unsatisfactorily left in the air. The main dishes were as good as you can expect if you're unwilling to hit up the northeast restaurants, but not from the prices: they are at least $2 too much each. They are already milking every penny from the customer, giving them small portions in a small space to eat in a very short time, all at huge prices. Drop the prices! You will still rake in the dough!  I daresay I will give them another chance (perhaps a lunch buffet), but although I did enjoy some of the dishes, there were too many things that went wrong to truly recommend Karma at this time.  22/30"}
{"text":"So disappointed with the way this place treated us tonight. I ordered food for my husband to pick up for us and when he arrived they had given our order to someone else who then brought it back without Naan bread bc his kids were hungry so we had to wait for them to make new Naan. I would likely have demanded new food since they gave ours to someone else or just demanded a refund but my husband just wanted to get home.  No apology, no discount or coupon. Just a \"here it is\" 20 minutes after my husband showed to pick it up.  Never had an issue with this place before and we love the food but I think we will be looking for a new place to get our Indian food fix from."}
{"text":"Karma karma karma karma....karma chameleeeeonnnn!  (See what I did there?  Now it's in your head...sorry peeps!)  Anyways, chameleon is a great way to describe Karma because it's trying to be something that it's not.  I took a client there for lunch (his suggestion) and hit up Yelp to find out what was good.  We had the buffet and I elected to sample the butter chicken.  It was...interesting.  I took a bite of it and was immediately reminded of another flavor that I've had many times previously.  But what was it?  It didn't belong in butter chicken, but it was familiar.  It took me about 10 minutes to figure it out - tomato soup!  Now, tomato soup is awesome and definitely a great lunch item, but it makes a horrible butter chicken.  I suppose an Indian restaurant in the burbs caters to a different crowd, and living downtown I'm probably spoiled with so many great options nearby.    Bottom line: You can get tomato soup from the grocery store and throw in your own chicken for a fraction of the cost.  If you're looking for authentic Indian at a reasonable price, it's worth it to drive a little further."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for the lunch buffet.  It's pretty good food!  The last time I went, though, the waitress seemed to want us to just leave.  It may have been because there was a huge group of people there who were letting their kids run around the place (why do people do that?!), but after one serving at the buffet the waitress took all of our silverware and I had to ask for it back so I could get some more-- she gave it back without apology as if we were bothering her.  Other than that, though, it's pretty good food and I plan to be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Hands down the best Indian restaurant we have found in Calgary. We drive from Killarney to check out this gem. My wife is vegan and loves the dishes there. I love spicy and they have actual spice in their food.   Highly recommend if you have been looking for a new Indian spot."}
