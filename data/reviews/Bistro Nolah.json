{"text":"Modern, refined and yet authentic Creole cuisine. I do not typically give 5-stars, but this great spot has earned it! Beautiful dishes and phenomenal service. Our waitress was fun yet professional, and expertly described the dishes.  The executive chefs/owners hail from The Willows so you know they know their stuff.  My friend and I started with a complimentary hushpuppie, and then shared the fried oysters, crab cakes, BBQ shrimp, and scallop dishes. Each dish was beautifully prepared with care. I particularly loved the fried oysters, which were fried in a light and satisfying batter that didn't compromise the delicate texture of the oysters. The crab cakes also get extra props for the fact that they were made of cooked down whole crab and served in a different yet equally good batter. We ended with homemade beignets - amazing!  We washed down our meal with a lovely pitcher of white sangria and all for $60 pp, tax an tip included. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the braised short rib served with roasted parsnip, potato puree, doused in a homemade barbecue sauce. I'm a big fan of short ribs, so the bar was set high when I ordered this dish. The meat was tender and broke without the assistance of a knife. The unctuousness of the meat was not fatty, but moist; it was highlighted by the nectarous barbecue sauce that I could have drank by the glassful. The short ribs' distinct flavour comes through no matter what the preparation is, no matter what cuisine it subscribes to. The intrinsic savoury characteristic and beefiness makes my knees weak and eyes glaze..."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Bistro Nolah three times since September and it has become our favourite restaurant. You can't really go wrong with any of their dishes but the highlights would be the fried oysters, seafood gumbo, lamb chops, shrimp and grits. The grits are truly delicious as well as the crab cakes and make room for bread pounding with bourbon sauce. The duck confit was \"fall of the bone\" but I recommend that dish for dinner because during lunch it had a different, much sweeter, sauce that was just okay. Catfish on puréed sweet potatoes was delicious today. We will be going back soon and I will gladly share pictures and more info on our meal."}
{"text":"We were there the other night for an end-of-week celebratory dinner and sat in the enclosed patio out back. This was quite comfortable despite the cool temperature outside, because it was enclosed and had heat lamps.   Our order for drinks and meals was taken quite quickly but the timing of the rest of the meal was quite slow. It wasn't the waitress' fault as the food was hot when it came out so it seemed the bottleneck was probably in the kitchen, which is surprising considering that there were some empty tables. One comment on the wine - I understand there is a markup but two glasses costing more than the bottle (double the price) at the SAQ seems a bit much.  To start, we tried hush puppies, compliments of the chef, were which had good taste to them, although slightly overdone. I had the seafood gumbo as an entree, which good-sized portion with large shrimp and scallops and a nice spice. Good although for the price, I would have liked to see more seafood. My dining companion tried the crab cakes - again, decent flavour despite the slightly-too-thick outer crust - nothing to write home to mom about.  Both of us ordered a grilled catfish in a lime-butter sauce served with a sweet potato purée and seasonal vegetables. This one hit a high note. The plating was beautiful with the catfish was very tasty and kind of spicy and the sweet potatoes creamy. Full points for that dish. For dessert, we had the trio of desserts sampled the beignets, the bread pudding the chocolate torte. The bread pudding was by far the big hit of the three.   Overall, good food, but very pricey, especially for the 'burbs - convenient if you live in the WI and don't want to venture too far."}
{"text":"Was invited to lunch here with a lifelong buddy. I had never been here before but was impressed with their online reviews. Let to confirm that Nolah did not disappoint. In fact, my spicy Seafood Gumbo was just what this cold Canadian winter day called for. Cynthia, the manager, was so warm, professional and polite that it just made the lunch a pleasant one. The bread buns are baked fresh every day from scratch and were also superb. I know I will be back to savor some more southern meals. I was not surprised to hear that their is sometimes a lineup to get in!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation weeks in advance for a special occasion, with special request to be seated at a quiet area by the window.   We arrived and were told that we had to sit next to a very large group away from the window while there was a table by the window that was not taken. They told us it was reserved. We explained that we had requested the same many weeks ago. They looked into their booking system and decided that we could take the table. We were seated, had our water, and were about to order.  Then, the maître d came to our table and asked us to move. She didn't provide any explanation why our reservation was not honoured but yet another customer's reservation request was. Apparently, \"allowing\" us to seat at the table by the window was \"a mistake\". It was certainly difficult to continue to stay for our special evening after being treated as such.  We can't think of any establishments that adheres to a basic understanding of customer experience that would do such a thing. Due to the fact that Nolah couldn't pull their act together, the customer experience was compromised. We left and have not gone back since."}
{"text":"Went to Bistro Nolah with my wife and had an excellent time. If I could give 4.5 stars I would. We were greeted by the very polite and friendly host and he sat us down on the charming patio outside. They have a shorter menu than most restaurants but that works tremendously in their favour since it doesn't bombard you with a million choices. I settled on the chorizo sausage and grits entrée followed by the bavette curi main dish - both were outstanding!  My wife had the salad to start and kept raving about the vinaigrette. As the main dish she ordered the tender fried scallops accompanied with mashed sweet potato and vegetables. Will definitely go back to try everything on the menu. All in all a really unique gem in the West Island"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Since we moved to the West Island, we have been on a desperate search for good restaurants close to home. I was very disappointed. I ordered a kale and potato soup to start. It was ok, but pretty bland. My main course was TERRIBLE. I love comfort food so I made the mistake of ordering the Mac and cheese. It was so oily and greasy that I couldn't eat more than 2 bites. The flavour also wasn't very good. The only reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars is because my fiancé loved his main course -Cajun shrimp.  On a side note, I actually took a picture of how greasy the mac and cheese was. I was kind of obsessed with how something could contain so much oil - I took my dinner home and let it sit on a strainer and you would not believe how much fat dripped off and out of it. Anyway, no good.   I would also like to note that I am in no way someone who doesn't like their food with fat and flavour (not one of \"those\" girls). The other day I ate a container of icing (don't judge me). But this was way too much fat."}
{"text":"We were given a heads up regarding a Cajun restaurant on the West Island.   My companion and I wanted to go out for dinner; in celebration of the start of our vacation. We decided to give Bistro Nolah a try.    We couldn't be happier with the choice. By Montreal standards, we arrived early and had our choice of tables, indoor or the terrasse. We chose indoors; I'm not a big fan of outdoor eating.   The waiter was courteous, knew the menu and was extremely professional. Welcoming but not fawning. (Personally, I hate fawning.)   Nolah has a very good wine list; we decided to forgo the wine and chose cocktails instead. I had the West Island tea - a cute take on Long Island Ice tea and Dave had a spicy Caesar. Both drinks were delicious and should have been our clue for what was to come.   The waiter brought us both complimentary Hush Puppies. Delicious, not too spicy, fried to perfection; I ordered crab cakes as my appetizer and my partner  chose the fried oysters.   My crab cakes were tender and seasoned perfectly. It is very easy to spoil a crab dish, with too much seasoning. Crab is delicate and the chef at the Bistro proved he understood how it should be treated.  My companion's fried oysters were the same, the batter and the oyster were partners. Too often there is simply too much batter and the oyster loses any hope of being found. He was much impressed.   Our entrees? As luck would have it; the catch of the day was, catfish!! Our favourite fish dish. The presentation was eye-popping. It was almost a sin to eat it. The catfish was served on a bed of sweet potato, with perfectly done carrots, fresh green beans, a persimmon, halved with what I believe were gooseberries as accents. A tablespoon of caviar on the top of the catfish brought everything to center focus.   You know how the expression goes? You can't tell a book by its cover? Well, regardless of how beautifully this was plated, the tastes were even more so. The catfish was flaky but moist and chock full of flavour. The sweet potato was in perfect balance with the spicy coating on the fish. The vegetables were perfectly prepared. While we love La Louisianne; I have to say that I prefer the Bistro Nolah. La Lou can, sometimes, be too heavy handed with the seasoning and spices. Nolah gets it. If you live in Montreal and want to check it out? Blue Haven Centre, 3669 blvd. St. Jean.

{"text":"I can't believe I've passed by this restaurant for years and never tried it. I LOVED it. So good. It was packed and I understand why. The food was fantastic and the wine as well! Try it. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great place . Food is excellent. Reservations are recommended for Friday and Saturday nights . The  Sunday brunch is a nice alternative to standard breakfast choices. Service is excellent . During summer months there is a small terrace ."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cajun cuisine on the West Island. The meal was delicious from the drinks to dessert. We has the fried jambalaya ball, tomato chipotle soup, beet salad, Cornish hen, shrimp and grits, and shrimp creole. The flavour was great, and everything was prepared to perfection! I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Came here years ago for a special celebratory dinner... The waiter was very friendly and helpful in giving us descriptions & recommendations. All the dishes were so unique that everyone in my family ended up sharing their respective meals with eachother! All the food was excellent, and when we gave our compliments to the chef we were given an extra special complimentary dish!!  It was probably the most expensive meal in my life, but also the most fancy/high-quality/memorable dining experience I ever had."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place and here's why.  It is a true foodie living in the West Island dream. They have a creative small menu with a New Orleans theme. The food is delicious. You can tell it was made by a talented chef. The restaurant is small and quaint and they have a terrace!! The service is extremely friendly. They gave us complimentary hush puppies while we waited for our food, they were SO tasty.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and my dad got the short ribs. I've eaten a lot of food in my life but the flavours in that dish still stick out in my mind. It was that tasty. The drink list is also very cute and southern inspired.   This restaurant is a must visit spot in the West Island! Thank you for opening in the West Island and not downtown!"}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with a friend on Saturday night ...sat out on a beautifully quaint terrace Had the best fried oysters I've had in a very long time . then the crab cakes ....what can I say...superb... Mains we both had shrimp and grits... Mouth watering.... To top it off with the best wait staff anywhere Overall....a great dinner experience"}
{"text":"Went twice.....first time food was amazing but service super slow. And there were only four tables in the restaurant. Second time food was so/so and service was still super slow. Neither time was on a weekend. Not to the fault of the waitstaff so much, the kitchen takes forever to cook the food. An hour and thirty before we were served our main dish! Restaurant could manage a little better. The short ribs were tasty but the sweet potato soup was a hit the first time and tasteless the next."}
{"text":"Hats off to the chef! The food was outstanding! I had the shrimp and grits and tried a few desserts (we were a party of 6) and they were all delicious. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Amazing dishes. Whether it was seafood or meat, everyone found this fantastic. Jalepeno popppers that they served on the house with spicy mayo were incredible. Beignes were just ok."}
{"text":"Good and hearty southern food. Mac and cheese, gumbo, jambalaya, crab cakes, short rib and all sorts of other decadent and delicious items to choose from. I like to order a few different things and share, gives a good overview of the chef's talent. Nice little spot for a date night, very cozy and warm atmosphere. One of the good spots in the area for sure."}
{"text":"We have been going to this hidden gem for a few years now.  The staff is friendly and helpful and what can I say about the food, simply delicious! We initially started going there for special occasions but now we have made it one of regular dinner spots.  Excellent Crabcakes and one of the few places you can actually find Grits.  Once of their signature dishes, Shrimp and Grits is awesome, without forgetting my personal favorite, the Braised Beef Short Rib that melts in you mouth."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. The staff is friendly and attentive.  Furthermore, the food is fantastic. I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Nous avons beaucoup aimé ce restaurant, qui a été un coup de cur. Nous attendions pas à trouver des spécialités cajuns de cette qualité dans un petit restaurant perdu dans l'Ouest-de-L'Île. Les croquettes de poisson étaient particulièrement succulentes. Nous étions assied au bar et le service fut excellent. Si vous aimez la nourriture cajun, ce restaurant vaut le détour !"}
{"text":"C' est a ma troisième visite que je décide enfin d' écrire mon avis du Bistro Nolah. Pour un lunch d'affaire c' est parfait. Beaucoup de lumière, pas besoin de crier pour se parler et une douce musique Jazz se fait entendre. Le service est chaleureux, efficace et professionnel. Le serveur était  au fait de son menu et en a fait ses descriptions et recommandation très inintéressantes et  appétissante. Il est très agréable d' avoir un bon choix de vins aux verres affiché sur les ardoises accrochés au mur. J' ai pu découvrir un blanc de la Toscane qui était excellent. Nous étions 5 a la table et 3 plats principaux différents ainsi que 2 entrées ont été commandés. Les croquettes de fruits de mer ont été très appréciées par ma voisine de table. Ne mon coté j' ai choisi le Crab Cake. Comme a son habitude il fut croustillant et moelleux. Délicieuse petite boule de crabe, avec mon verre de blanc ce fut parfait! Le premier plat principal fut les crevettes Créoles. De belles crevettes grilles servies dans une sauces relevée mais pas trop. Les légumes croquants complétaient l' assiette. Ce plat fut très bon selon ma collègue. Mon amie d' en face elle commande le saumon. Belle grosse portion de saumon poché servi avec les légumes croquants du jours. Mon amie qui a voyagé pas mal autours du monde et qui est un peu difficile a satisfaire m' a dit que c'était le meilleur saumon qu'elle a eu l' occasion de manger......Tout un compliment venant d' elle croyez mois. Pour ma part j' ai choisi encore une fois le Gumbo qui cette fois était aux crevettes. Encore une fois il était excellent et bien relevé comme un tel plat doit l' être. Pour le dessert nous avons tous opté pour l pudding au pain et sa sauce au Bourbon. Servi chaud ce dessert était de trop mais tellement bon.....détail important en fin de repas, le café qui est servi est fait a la minute avec du café espresso. Belle touche qui garanti un bon café au lieu d' un fond de carafe comme cela arrive malheureusement trop souvent. En résumé, a ce restaurant les choses sont bien faites avec amour et passion du métier. Cela se reflète  dans l' assiette. Si vous vous demandé si je compte retourne a ce restaurant c' est que vous n' avez pas bien lu mon article."}
{"text":"Be prepared for low quality, mushy potatoes, difficult to digest, friendly wait staff, over priced,catfish was not recognizable with the overflow of potatoes dominating the dish. Perhaps we simply did not choose the correct item on the menu. I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and give some serious props to Nolah! Oh my god is this restaurant good. Southern cooking, we do not get too much of around here, but their Shrimp and Grits is to die for, as is the seafood gumbo, crabcakes, well basically everything that we tried was super delicious. We had a hush puppy as an amuse-bouche and it was delicious as is their biscuits.   I didn't know what to expect coming here, but if you want some serious comfort food, this is the place to be. I still can't get over how amazing their grits is. SO GOOD.  I wish I was able to take photos but unfortunately lighting was quite dim. The service was great, seats were comfortable, and overall it's not too big of a place but super quaint. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I Love the atmosphere here! Such a nice Friday night. The lobster cake sample is the best! The mac and cheese are rich! The people are nice! I'll try the veal next time tho. Literally a interest place with fun menu to explore. Just want to go there again for the next time."}
{"text":"The cooks kept staring at us through the kitchen window the entire time! I found it very unsettling and it ruined my appetite. My wife was beyond pissed off...."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a more upscale restaurant in the west island, Bistro Nolah is the place to go. The food is nothing short of amazing and the drinks are pretty good as well.   The restaurant is fairly small, the decor is elegant and the lights are dim, creating the perfect atmosphere for an intimate dinner.   I had the blackened cat fish and although I found it to be a bit heavy (a lot of oil and spices are used in this dish), it was one of the best meals I've had. You should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine, good service, relaxed small place no noise like big restaurants. Will definitely be going back. Crab cakes and bourbon oysters awesome. Braised short rib and shrimp plates were over the top!"}
{"text":"Another fabulous brunch at Nolah's ! Great food and service! Bread pudding for dessert -phenomenal! Can't go wrong with anything you choose to eat!"}
{"text":"Hidden Small space in the West Island which serves  Louisiana type foods. Great option and very different from all other restaurants in the neighbourhood. Nice presentations and good portions. Nice to have something other than Italian or Asian in the West Island. Worth trying! Enjoy!"}
