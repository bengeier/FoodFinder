{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent quality! This place is a must go if you like taking your taste buds for a trip. The naan bread is the best I've ever had and I've eaten a lot of naan. Guaranteed satisfaction, and the diversity in foods is a definite come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times and it is one of the hidden gems of Middle Eastern/Indian restaurants in Scarborough without a doubt. I think this place is still considered to be fairly new so it's not well known yet, which means there's always seats available and lots of good, affordable food options to choose from!  Right after you order, they bring you a complimentary order of these deep-fried, slightly puffed pita chips with homemade hummus (every time I've gone the hummus has been different. Most recently it had a variety of peppers as well as garlic)  Their butter chicken, Bhoona Ghosht (bone-in stewed beef), lamb karahi and chicken tikka masala are all out of this world.   Their butter chicken comes with a sizeable amount of tender chicken slathered with a genrous portion of their scarlet-golden coloured incredible creamy, tomato-ey gravy. Perfect for dipping with naan, roti, or the deep-fried variant known as paratha. A hint of spice, rich flavours make this a mainstay dish of many Indian restaurants and Spice Shack does not dissappoint.  Their bhoona ghosht is essentially chunks of beef with the bone still on to impart extra flavour and fragrance, marinated in a rich tomato sauce. This is a rather hearty dish, and not spicy at all.   the chicken karahi is similar to the ghosht but with lamb and much spicier.   The chicken tikka masala is amazing -- huge pieces of juicy chicken meat coated in a light layer of middle-eastern spices, all on an iron plate that creates that delectable sizzling noise that immediately whets the appetite. In addition, you get all the vegetables on the side as well. This dish has a bit of a kick to it with the heat, but it is flavourful and biting into that boneless chicken meat is great.   The first time I went service took a rather long time despite it being not too busy, but I don't mind a slowed down eating atmosphere sometimes. The second time I went it took a little bit longer than expected, but it was more than acceptable for the great food they brought out to us. Don't come here expecting super fast food though!"}
{"text":"I used to like spice shack until this incident a few weeks back.. My 4 yr old wanted halwa puri. So we end up at spice shack around noon. It was empty. I ordered halwa puri and sat down. 25 mins down and nothing as yet. Finally a waitress walks over holding up a pack of frozen baturas from the brand Deep. She explained that the grocery next door ran out of puris and if it's ok for them to serve these baturas instead! I was shocked!  It's probably just me but when I go to a restaurant I expect the food to be freshly prepared. I can make frozen store bought  puris at home too.  It made me wonder what other dish items at Spice Shack came from frozen prepackaged meals from the Grocer.  Anyways, since we had been waiting for over 40 mins and my son was hungry I agreed. 15 mins later we get  burnt baturas along with the halwa. Seems like the cook didn't know how to prepare frozen baturas.  That's when I gave up. Since the place was empty I just told the guy in the office that we are leaving. The guy then goes on to explain that they are having trouble with their kitchen. Well... That's the first thing he should have told me when I walked in!  No more Spice Shack for us.   Ps: while we were waiting we were served complimentary hummus with nachos since the wait was too long."}
