{"text":"I love their crust and fresh veggies on the vegetarian pizza. Definitely worth checking out over the same old Pizzaville/hut/pizza etc"}
{"text":"Ordered late night and was surprised by the quick delivery service and customer service by both the man on the phone and the delivery guy. The food was equally amazing, just a pepperoni pizza and wings but both were better than you're average overrated pizza franchise."}
{"text":"Agree with Dave M. The dude working here was really nice. They have some stuff that caters to the South Asian market in Brampton (green chilies, etc), which I think is very smart. Their Pizza is really good. Thin slices.   I think next time I decide to order pizza I'll get it here. The dude was really helpful and was really talking up his product, which is a nice change of pace from the usual grunt and unimpressed look you get at other Pizza Joints in Brampton."}
{"text":"While driving home this evening, I came upon Pizza Fiamma. I was lured in by the flashing neon signs, indicating they were now open, and advertising their specials.  The interior is pretty small. There are 2 counters for people dining-in, probably seating 6 customers between the 2 of them.  The gentleman serving me was extremely nice, and boasted that they had the best pizza around. I was up to challenging such a bold statement...alright, maybe it's not so bold, as the pizzeria's around are mostly disappointing. I opted for a lone slice of pepperoni to satisfy my curiosity, and off I went with one of their menus.  Delicious! I have to say, generally ordering a slice means you get something that has been sitting forever under the lamps, and has the bare minimum of cheese and sub-par pepperoni, but this was just great. It seemed like there was way more cheese than you would normally find without requesting extra cheese, and that's not a bad thing. I don't know, something about this pizza just sang, and I loved it.  Upon examining their menu, I noticed more than 1 really solid deal (extra large pizza for $8.99? Uh, yes please!), and they also serve the standard pizza place items: Garlic bread, panzos, wings, potato wedges etc, and they also offer free delivery for orders over $10. I can't wait to see what Fiamma has to offer when I place my first large order."}
{"text":"You're getting care put into your pizza which ultimately packs it with flavour, and it really blows a deja vu named pizza chain out of the water. The toppings are always nicely arranged and rather delicious. And as pointed out in another review, sometimes a head honcho will show his interest for providing a quality pizza by asking if you liked your last order or something like that.  Bonus: A dipping sauce is included with a pizza."}
{"text":"Will order again! The price was great- medium 4 topping for 13 bucks plus free delivery. The pizza: cooked right, was nice and crispy & they were really generous with the amount of toppings on the pizza - lots of pineapple and beef, way more than I'd normally get with pizza pizza or domino's.  Really happy with them! Consider giving them a try. Only downside is there is extra 1$ charge for half/half topping pizza."}
{"text":"This is easily the best pizza in the region. I happened upon this place last year and it's the only pizza I order when I'm in Brampton. The prices are really worth it and the quality of the food is great. Also, the staff is friendly and accommodative."}
{"text":"Tried their large 4 topping veggie pizza with tons of garlic, ginger and chilli. The base was a little overdone and the flavours were just average. For $14 it wasn't a bad deal."}
{"text":"Great pizza. My first time trying it. My brother highly recommended Pizza Fiamma.  This pizza definitely hit the spot at 2 am and studying all evening long. Only 4 stars as their delivery radius is not very broad."}
{"text":"I was so happy today I walked into pizza fiamma at 2:30 and he was so happy to help me ! I am pregnent and my brother has told me about this place but I always use to order pizza pizza !!!

{"text":"Edit: I received a call from the manager with a sincere apology and an offer to make amends of the situation. It seems that there has been other complaints about the person I dealt with last night and he wanted to make sure I got the service I deserve. He provided his cellphone number and my next order is free. Thank you to this business owner who takes his customers seriously, for taking my input and (I must admit) harsh critique to improve his business and go out of his way to better his service to paying customers. I hope to try their panzos and give a new review and new rating they deserve.   Original: Worst delivery ever. Don't even bother that they're open late. Completely useless and idiotic staff. I just got off the phone of a man telling me to \"F off\". I sent my order at 11:25pm and got email confirmation. An hour passes and 2 panzos still haven't arrived.   I called at 12:25 to confirm when it's coming. They said 15 minutes, it's on its way. They apologized because they're so busy -  with NEW YEARS EVE parties. It's Dec 30th!!! You're a day early. - how does your excuse even hold up?! I'd understand if it's Friday night. But it's Thursday at 11pm.   I asked where they are located and its not even a 10 mins drive. They asked if I wanted to pick it up?  That means you lied to me when you said it was on its way! They reiterated their lame excuse and said \"my order is NOW IN PROCESS, because of the New Years Eve parties\" WTF...  Then when I call out the fact that their excuse doesn't stand, and it still shouldn't have taken an hour, therefore will I be getting my order free?  \"Nothing is free in this world ma'am, we're making it right now - if you don't want it we will eat it\"  * slow clap *   Great piece of business you have here of what seems to be less of a pizza place but a lab of monkeys. I take that back, that's an insult to intelligent, highly-skilled primates.   I hope a visit from a health inspector soon devalues your business and exposes your substandard hygienic practices and I will be gladly waiting the day in which I can flag this business as \"permanently closed\" on Yelp."}
