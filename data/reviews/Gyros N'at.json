{"text":"The cleanest food truck ever! The people were all friendly and kind. I liked their lamb meat."}
{"text":"I ate from their food stand, and it's one of the best gyros I've had in Pittsburgh. The meat and onions were really juicy and flavorful, and the tzatziki was really garlicky. The grape leaves were also juicy and flavorful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"CUTE GUY SERVING GYROS! AND THEY ARE X FILES FANS! BONUS!  Hi All!  It's been busy career madness this fall. My job is my endless distraction. But I still have time for dinner dates ;)  I took myself out to Brew Gents for a beer (to cry away those nursing woes) and decided I totally needed a Gyro!   When I was a kid my dad refused to buy American fast food so gyros from the greek place were as about \"fast food\" as we got!  I sound like such a flirt but the guy taking my order wasn't so bad looking! And the gyro was great! They had these seasoned fries that totally hit the spot with my cold beer!  I noted 2 X -Files action figures while waiting for my order so you had this secret Sci-Fi dork from the start!  I would recommend this truck if they are at a brewery near you!   Love you!  muah!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend tried a gyro at the Brew Gentlemen December food truck round up and after would not stop commenting on how good it was...even though he didn't want to drive the 30 minutes back to Brew Gentlemen for me to get to try it. Finally, they were participating in a food truck events at the Public Market and we decided to go.  He was absolutely right that the gyros were amazing. The best I've ever had. I love watching them cut the strips of meat off the spit. The meat was flavorful and the grilled onions were included, which is awesome. Then they top each gyro with garlicky tzatziki sauce, lettuce and raw onions. The pita was fluffy and warm and I was glad the Public Market had tables inside to eat because it was messy. I already can't wait to have this again and am plotting to have my boyfriend drive us to Brew Gentlemen one Saturday so we can cure my newfound gyro craving."}
{"text":"Best food truck in the Burgh, seriously!  This place knocks it out of the park for meat lovers (my BF) and vegetarians (me) alike, which is not always easy. My absolute favorite is their falafel wrap, which is perfectly seasoned and topped with tzatziki and a light vinaigrette that's to die for (I wish they'd sell bottles of it). The Greek salad portion is very generous and doesn't skimp on anything: nice spring greens,  olives, tomatoes, onions, feta and tzatziki. Their hummus & pita is awesome as a snack or side, and they also have a big veggie platter with grape leaves, roasted red peppers, hummus & pita, olives, and feta. For a truck with \"Gyros\" in the name,  I couldn't believe how many vegetarian options they have that I honestly love. You could even have a great vegan meal here, and the produce is always nice and fresh. No matter what you order, get a side of fries- they're delicious and you got a surprisingly large amount for $2 or $3 (Oh, and get the baklava-yum). Gyros N' At never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This gyro stand has the best gyros I have ever eaten hands down.  The portion sizes is huge, enough for two people, but you are gonna want your own. Served on a crisp pita, tons of flavorful meat, fresh vegetables on top and they will grill you onions if prefer, all served with a cool delicious taziki sauce that tops it off perfectly. This gyro is as authentic as you're going to get and for a really great price.  They also have some really good vegetarian options, and they also have a platter that serves almost every item you can get at the stand.  The owner / cook is a very nice guy very attentive to the quality of the food and always makes sure his customers leave with a smile and a full belly. It's definitely worth a drive down the Main Street in Braddock on Saturdays to pick up a gyro at the Brew Gentlemen's Brewery. I have seen the stand at other events and locations too. Follow them on Facebook and Instagram to find out if the are adding additional days and locations and get some crazy delicious gyros."}
{"text":"Probably the best gyro in the city. I love Mike and Tony's but theirs what far better. Great hummus & fresh grilled pita. Very reasonably priced. $20 for gyro, hummus & pita and Greek salad with gyro. 12/10 would follow all over city!"}
{"text":"We have always noticed the gyro food truck in front of  the Brew Gentlemen's Brewery in Braddock  traveling on our way to the Waterfront, and have always wanted to stop. They have not always been there, so check their site on facebook and Instagram to make sure they are before traveling and being disappointed as we have been several times.  WE LOVE GYRO\"s and will travel to get a really great one as many of my post, will let you know.   The gyros were good.  Not the best I've ever had., but I did enjoy it.  The meat was flavorful and the grilled onions were a wonderful addition to the gyro.  Each gyro is topped with tzatziki sauce, fresh lettuce and raw onions. The sauce is good,  not over powering. It was a good gyro for a good price.   Mike & Tony's is still my go to Gyro fix here in Pittsburgh, but Gyros N' at are a close second and would highly recommend if you see the truck."}
{"text":"Yum, large portions and right outside the door of Brew Gentlemen. A great combination for a Saturday evening in the summer."}
{"text":"Hands down the best gyro in Pittsburgh. The vinaigrette that is added at the end pulls everything together. Make sure you add some roasted red peppers and feta. You won't be disappointed!! I know Mike n Tony's is a staple, but Gyros n At is king of the hill."}
{"text":"Downright the best Gyro I've ever had.   Great value - $7 for a pound of deliciously roasted Greek Goodness. The pita is warm and fluffy and delicious. Grilled onions for no extra charge. That's what I'm talking about.   I waiting in line for $45 minutes in 40 degree weather and don't regret a thing."}
{"text":"4.5 stars so I will round up.  Gyro's N'at is typically at Brew Gentlemen in Braddock which is pretty perfect.  Really nice guys that keep their customers happy. If you're in the mood for cheese fries these are the best in the Burgh and go great with some beers from the bow tied adorned bar tenders inside.  The fries are double fried crisp and have the stadium cheese layered in so you keep getting cheese as you dig down and because no fry is drowning in cheese they stay pretty crisp. Oh and don't forget the Gyro, this bad boy will feed a really hungry person or somewhat hungry people."}
{"text":"If your like gyros you'll love GN'at. Big juicy sloppy gyro made to order.   Tasty crisp french fries too.  There are other options including a Breakfast Gyro...next time."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating a little bit of everything thing last night the gyro was one of the Best , I have had the pleasure eating! It's topped with a balsamic dressing rather than your typical tattaziki! Falafel was great! Vegetable platter was the bomb,pita and hummus Greek olives feta all perfect portions! Topped it all off baklava, delicious crunchy walnut a plenty with the perfect hint of cinnamon! The guys putting it all together way just as sweet as can be! Keep up the great work!"}
