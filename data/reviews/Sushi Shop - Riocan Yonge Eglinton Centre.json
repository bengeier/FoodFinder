{"text":"First I loved the sushi taco, then the sushi bowl, now the sushi burrito! Everything is made fresh and top quality from the salmon to the avocado. 

Friendly staff will make whatever you like ordered to go. I end up visiting this place about 4 times a week!"}
{"text":"Love their poke bowls with free drink. Salmon always very fresh and tasty. Worth to try."}
{"text":"NEVER come here. 

Lemme just start off saying that I normally LOVE sushi shop - I find their rolls very unique and very good tasting. I also find that each individual sushi shop differs a lot in taste and cleanliness, and this one, lacks in both areas. I've been here twice, the first time I got the salmon taco, which was not worth the price and didn't taste that great. The second time, I got the 911 with salmon and got food poisoning that put me out for a whole two days AND it didn't even taste good. Honestly I'm so put off if I could give this place negative stars, I would. Perhaps it was just a bad batch and I was unlucky but even so, you shouldn't be serving your customers anything that may remotely have gone bad. 

The service was also quite slow but overall they were very nice..so I guess that's a plus. My frequent go to sushi show at the Telus building downtown also gave free miso soup with each meal and didn't charge $1 to change the combos though, and this place does not so....yeah. Definitely boycotting this place."}
{"text":"Dynamite roll best in THE GTA!  Fresh great prices. Was double parked and they delivered my food in two minutes when I told them. You'll be very happy with everything here !"}
{"text":"I tried sushi burrito before but this place is pretty good it is quite filling I had the spicy salmon burrito it is a big sushi roll basically I want to eat another one but it is quite filling I think it is just as good as rolltation"}
{"text":"Let's start with the service.  Forget a smile or an acknowledgement.

Hand roll - salmon - more rice than anything else.  Did not have the zip and zest which I would have expected.

Meh."}
{"text":"Totally awesome sushi! Been here many times as I work in the building - their sushi are super fresh, tons of flavor, prices are low and service is fast.  
I am very hard to please, but this place won me forever.  I've been coming here for over a year now, and it is great."}
{"text":"This is fast food sushi in the food court. It's okay sushi & maki. Good for a snack or quick bite to go. It's not the best in the world, but it's also not the worst. I've had sushi in restaurants that charge more & it tasted worse. So I'm giving them points for that."}
{"text":"YUM!

So, I had their menu delivered to my place a few weeks ago and i was seriously impressed by the wide variety of options! The menu is so well made and everything looks and sounds really good! I couldn't help but stop by today on my way home from work.

I must say, this is by far the best take out sushi I have had. Ever! The fish and all the ingredients were so fresh and so flavourful! Not sure what was included in my combo sushi/roll plate since they didn't have any names on the label but it was absolutely delicious! Would definitely recommend!"}
