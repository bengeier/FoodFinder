{"text":"My son and I went on a whim for lunch and were glad we did. We had the mango roll, Shoyu ramen & Samurai ramen. The broths for both soups were amazing.  There was a depth to the soups that was heavenly and my son liked the amount of meat to noodle ratio. I liked that the soft boiled egg had been lightly marinated in a sweet soy sauce for added flavour.  The mango roll was lovely with a hint of sweet mango sauce. Definitely one of the best mango rolls we've tried so far in Calgary. We were so full we had to take leftovers home. My son wants to go there for his bday dinner now."}
{"text":"Very yummy Ramen! good serving and great service.. i love the complimentary Motoyaki.. very tasy treat.."}
{"text":"Meh. This place looks amazing in the reviews and the photos, but the sushi was really bad. We ordered toro which is tuna belly, and they tried to pass off white tuna as toro (I know my fish and quality). The rainbow roll we ordered was really underwhelming and the tuna on top was not fresh at all. I would never go here again. I figure the reviews are all 5 stars because this place is in Marlborough and people there don't know what good sushi is or the restaurant had their friends rate it 5 stars.  To the restaurant: if you post photos of what the food is supposed to look like, you better match up what you give the customer to the picture, otherwise you'll get more awful reviews like this one.   I did not try the ramen, maybe that is better..."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with this place, the maki is good, the rolls are good, the miso soup is good, haven't tried the ramen yet so I cannot say much about that but it's an amazing place. it's for sure a safe bet if your in the market for some good sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi and ramen place so far! I hope you could open same restaurant in Edmonton.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. I'm not a fan of sushi but my daughter is and she throughly enjoyed the Katana Roll and she recommends it. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it came with a fresh salad   The miso soup was amazing and I have to say the chicken teriyaki is the best I've tasted. The service was spectacular, very attentive without overwhelming us. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my 1st time eating here after eating  Turkey and ham from the holidays so I suggested to my hubby I'd like to have soup somewhere and he suggested we go to this place since it's with good reviews and so off we go!  The host greeted us warmly and ushered us promptly to our seats. Afterwards ,he gave us a complimentary appetizer of shrimp, seaweed and mushroom combo and we just loved it!  I ordered the Samurai Ramen ~ a creamy broth of peanuts and other spice,pork, seaweed , bean sprouts , and an egg . First sip will make you cough a lil bit coz of the spice but eventually it gets better, since I'm used to spicy food & it's just the right spice for me, the broth is quite different from what I've used to taste in Tonkatsu ramen , but I like the change, noodles are just cooked right.  Hubby ordered a tonkatsu Ramen and said the broth is nice, he likes the addition of egg and seaweed on it . And he ordered some mushroom tempura too. I liked this , it has a light taste and not greasy, my 4 yr old even commented it's super yummy!  We also had the chicken avocado roll as it's cooked coz we have a 4 yr old son in tow and he raved about it as well! What can I say, great service, good food and good atmosphere! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem in the NE, they have my favourite sushi roll, the spicy salmon crunch. I could eat this roll everyday. The tonkotsu ramen broth is soooo flavorful and delicious. Make sure you eat in house, it's much better than SkipTheDishes. You also get a complimentary motoyaki. Service is good too!"}
{"text":"Came her for lunch it's a bit hidden in the strip mall but there lots of parking. First impressions it's a bit old but clean. The service was 5/5! Once I entered we were warmly greeted. We ordered the spicy ramen, miso soup, crunchy spicy salmon roll and the rainbow roll. The ramen was flavourful and perfect amount of spice. The sushi was very good and fresh. The prices are much lower than other sushi restaurants too. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here 2-3 times since they opened.  Their sushi is very well done and dare I say the best in the area.  I would come here more often if they offer lunch specials or bentonite boxes as I like the variety of not eating the same roll as the only thing for lunch.  It is something that this restaurant's predecessor did well and as a result got a lot of my business.  The ramen was okay but nothing spectacular.  The service is always good here and I have no problem referring my coworkers here."}
{"text":"After getting a craving for ramen for dinner my boyfriend suggested samurai as it had been mentioned amongst his friends. I guess they're pretty new! I had originally ordered the samurai ramen but our server warned it is spicy so in the end we had an order of tuna sashimi , sushi pizza, and two orders of tonkotsu ramen. Right now they give you a complimentary mototaki appetizer which was fantastic! He was happy with his sashimi, the sushi pizza was wonderful and a generous portion for the price, our ramen broth was deliciously creamy and not overly salty...and just like the sushi pizza the price just couldn't be beat. Our server was very attentive and appreciative of our patronage. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to support a small resto just starting up and appreciates great ramen. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy Ramen. It was delicious and the service was quick and very attentive. I enjoyed the house appetizer they served as well, a nice little surprise and added to the experience. If you're in the area I highly recommend stopping here!"}
{"text":"Excellent combination of ramen and sushi - both of high quality! The rolls are delicious and the soup is salty and well balanced. You get three slices of pork which is a bonus. Really like this place, definitely one of the best places for food in the area.  The only item I didn't care for was the creaming scallop. Tasted like miracle whip rather than Japanese mayonnaise. Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Great food.... good choices in the menu, including most common items as well as some new/less common items!!  It's a small but clean place... nothing much fancy, but nicely put together. The server was very polite with superb service.   In the appetizer menu... Motoyaki is an interesting item. Shrimp, scallops, seaweed, mushroom deliciously stacked on a spoon. Definitely this place deserves multiple visits."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my boyfriend took me out to see the cars. Around the lunchtime, we found a Japanese Restaurant for lunch. The name of the restaurant called Samurai Ramen and Sushi. It's located at 36 St NE #140, Calgary, which is right across the street from T& T Inc. It was very easier for people to find and park their car.  Environment  We arrived the Samurai Ramen and Sushi t 12 pm. It was a small Japanese Restaurant. There are many people in the restaurant. Luckily, we found a table fast. Inside the restaurant decorates in the  Japanese Style. There were couple Japanese Style Pictures on the Wall. Inside the restaurant was nice and clean.  Service  After we sat down, the server brought tea to the table. Our server was a Japanese Lady. She was very nice and friendly. She offered us useful suggestions to order the food.  Food & Prices  Based on the server's suggestion, we have ordered TAKOYAKI (5PCS), SUSHI PIZZA, TONKOTSU RAMEN, SAMURAI SPECIAL ROLL, MOTOYAKI (2PC). The food came out the kitchen one by one. They were all well cooked and tasty. First dish was two pieces MOTOYAKI (2PC). It made by Mushroom, scallop, shrimp, and seaweed baked with Japanese mayonnaise. It costs us $6.00, which is a little bit pricey. Next,  TAKOYAKI balls, Deep fried battered balls containing octopus, topped with fish flakes and mayo. One order comes with five pieces. It's $7.00.  SUSHI PIZZA was $10.00 Fresh, raw salmon, avocado, masago, and mayo on a tempura rice patty. TONKOTSU RAMEN was $13.50 a rich, salt-based pork stock topped with roasted pork, seaweed, bean sprouts, egg, and green onions. SAMURAI SPECIAL ROLL was Prawn tempura, salmon tempura, and avocado inside, topped with seared tuna. $14.50.  In total, we spent $51.00.   We had a great experience eating Samurai Ramen and Sushi. It was our first time having such great sushi in Calgary. Even though it was a little bit expensive and pricey, the taste of the food was totally worth the price. We love it. Highly recommend people to some samurai Ramen and Sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the high ratings are based on the demographics but I truly do not feel this establishment warrants 5 stars. I came here because another ramen place I wanted to eat at was closed between 3-5pm and it looked like it got great reviews throughout.   When you first walk in there's a pungent smell. I wasn't sure if it was from the humidity due to heavy rainfall and leaky ceiling. (Not a fault of theirs obviously, the landlord needs to have that fixed.) The smell didn't make me feel like really eating already as it is. The decor had a few nice items aside from the mismatching chairs and later on, a napping staff member at one of the tables. Anyway...  We got a complimentary dish with shrimp and mushrooms. It was very tasty. It took quite a long time but our 3 bowls of ramen eventually came out and they looked...meh. Considering the cost of each our bowls ranged from $12.50 to $15.00 I expected better. (Considering my favourite ramen joint, Shiki Menya, charges less than that and provides quality ingredients like fresh greens and large orange yolk egg...)   I can't say I recommend this place, but if you're in area craving ramen I guess it's acceptable if you're okay with ramen noodles that taste like Nissin chicken flavored instant noodles."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I've had in town. Good portion sizes. Try the mango shrimp appetizer. Would definitely come back. Great service."}
{"text":"I ended coming in around 8pm with my girlfriend, we ordered, the server was nice... sushi was super fresh and at a VERY VERY REASONABLE PRICE!!! For the 30 mins I sat and ate 4 delivery drivers came and went for skip the dishes. I will definitely be coming back more often."}
{"text":"Go ahead if you want bland tasting noodles that seem like they were from a package and then followed by the worst stomach ache ever. Got two diff ramen that looked the same and gave the same result - bad time. Throw your money somewhere else"}
{"text":"I had set off to try a different ramen spot intially but when they were closed I stumbled upon Samurai Ramen. Lucky for me I did ! Unassuming little spot in a strip mall that also specializes in Sushi. Typically I shy from places that do 2 different things IE: Sushi and Ramen but this place is legit. Small dining room that's a bit bright , but a hint of traditional Japanese decor meets modern. Hip hop and r&b play quietly in the back ground kind of thing. Service is prompt and attentive , very clean over all , and the food was very good. They bring you a complimentary appetizer called Umanaki ( scallop) just marvelous in flavor with a creamy finish. Seaweed , mixed greens, and tomato salad ( very good , add soy) and finally Spicy Tankatsu Ramen. Not the creamy broth I'm used to but a nice spice and well rounded flavor. Noodles were done perfectly, Chashu pork , bean sprouts, half and egg and green onion. I prefer bamboo , woodear mushrooms too but none the less very good. I'd suggest this place if you are in the area. Easy parking in the lot out front too"}
{"text":"Definitely among one of the better sushi places for the price and quality, especially in the northeast. Wasn't disappointed with anything I ordered."}
{"text":"I went in to get take out.....i was greeted with a stinky smell. I can't really point out what it is but it's not favourable.  Food quality- it's good Presentation- sloppy Friendliness- 50%  I can't understand what the server is saying... though she did got my order correct I keep on saying \" pardon me\"  The decor is nice it looks really clean....except for the smell...  It can only sit 35 people. So it's really a small restaurant."}
