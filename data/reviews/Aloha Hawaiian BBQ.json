{"text":"I went here because I was craving for some oxtail soup and since none of the other places were open and didn't want to wait until 11Pm to go to the Cali hotel, I decided to try this place. It wasn't too far away from home. When my bf and I walked in we were greeted by a lady, she was very friendly. 

The oxtail soup was pretty good, not too salty, and was  missing a little bit of flavor. Once you add the ginger in it makes it just right. I would come back here again since it's the only decent Hawaiian food in the Northwest side of town."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe it when I saw there was a Hawaiian place here in Las Vegas.  I was very excited to get a plate lunch (three generations of my family are from Hawaii so I know a thing or two about plate lunches).
The service can be a little slow at times but they make it up in quality and value.  I found their Kalua Pig and Hawaiian BBQ both to be very good.  I mean, as simple as a plate lunch is, believe it or not, I have had a bad one or two in my day.  Luckily not from here.  So long as I am commuting to Las Vegas, I will continue to enjoy this (sparingly).  Prices are VERY reasonable and value for the dollar is high."}
{"text":"My family are here this Sunday. We always try to looking for a good Hawaiian plate. Here we came to the right place. I has the Oxtail soup is terrific and my wife has the BBQ mix share with my son is the best. My daughter she has the chicken Katsu is the bomb. This the place I recommend for everyone come here to try the best Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Omg! I ordered for delivery and it was soooo quick I was amazed! Maybe like 10-15 minutes from order to door. The food was great totally hit the spot and was super convenient!!!! Great job!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Aloha BBQ a couple of weeks ago when I was having a chicken katsu and musubi craving (and I couldn't bring myself to go to L & L).  I'm so glad I did because the food here is delicious and they give you huge portions!!  The katsu was crispy and yet the meat was super juicy.  The portuguese fried rice is really flavorful and not very oily at all.  And the kimchi is the best around this area.

The only thing I didn't like was the gravy on the loco moco.  It just tasted salty and was a bit too gloppy.  But the hamburger meat was delicious so I can't complain too much.  I suggest ordering the loco moco with gravy on the side so that you can decide whether you like it or not."}
{"text":"I love this place,  best hawaiian food.
The chicken katsu, the loco moco are grate, and they have really  good spam musubis I recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"First off we USE to come here regularly with our family. The older cashier woman took our order. I first ordered the chicken katsu and immediately changed it to a regular short rib plate. When we received our order it was the chicken I had asked her to change for the short rib plate before we paid. She then proceeds to argue with me telling me I was wrong she only heard the chicken order. We told her we changed it for the short ribs, she didn't recall that. Not only was she UNHELPFUL, SHE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE ARGUING with us across the restaurant!! As a small business owner I will not support a poorly ran restaurant!!! And to make matters worse when the \"manager\" arrived all he could say is she misunderstood me! He did NOT offer to correct it. Good food but TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Yummm!! Wish they had more veges though!! Their food is always good! This is one of our go to for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great short ribs, rice and spam masubi!!  The chicken katsu was okay and the sauce was okay."}
{"text":"We took our three kids on a road trip during summer. It was difficult to find a restaurant that provides good food, good service with reasonable price. This was the only restaurant that satisfied our taste bud but didn't cost us a fortune. You can see the price from the menu that other people posted here. The restaurant was not fancy, but clean and comfortable. We ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, BBQ Short Ribs and few other items. I definitely agree with other reviewers that the sauce was delicious, and the portion was good too. During the time we were eating there, we saw quite a few group of people came in to pickup their to-go orders. If this restaurant was near our home, I might have ditched my kitchen already.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is super close to our old office. We have had lunch here on many occasions and have made the drive from our new location just to get some delicious, simple Hawaiian BBQ. We usually get the mixed plate with Beef Ribs, Chicken, and Mahi Mahi. The meats are pretty good, the rice is very tasty, and the macaroni salad is amazing. Price is very good for a lunch menu."}
{"text":"I just ordered in for the night as I didn't feel like going out and about. 
For starters, Aloha offers delivery and they're quite cheap (score). I got a combo plate with the hamburger steak, bbq beef, and katsu curry. 

The hamburger steak was tough and a bit bland for me personally. The gravy kind of stuck to the beef and was too thick. The Katsu chicken is good but there could be more curry. The reason I gave this place 3-stars was solely for the bbq beef. The beef is tangy and you get a bit of spice. It is literally phenomenal. If you ever need a place that delivers quick and is cheap, order Aloha. I definitely recommend the bbq beef."}
{"text":"I've had better Yelpers. This place wasn't bad, but I won't be back. I was looking for that taste. You know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and this was the worst order ever. We always order the same thing, the fried shrimp, mahi and chicken katsu combo plate, the fried shrimp, mahi BBQ chicken combo plate, beef fried saimin, spam saimin, BBQ chicken plate and a chicken katsu plate. Sometimes they're good others they're ok. Today everything was bad. It seems as if they're cutting costs by slicing the chicken and mahi length wise in half so it looks like the same amount but just much thinner. Nothing had taste even the saimin was watered down and half the amount of noodles. The fried saimin was half veggies half noodles with about 4 small pieces of beef. The BBQ chicken was thin and wasn't marinated enough so there was no taste. The chicken katsu was thin and overly fried it was like jerky. The katsu in my combo looked like left overs they cut and refried and the mahi was so thin it shriveled up into a curly q. I called them to tell them at the very least replace the katsu which was obviously refried so they told me to bring it back. Needless to say I brought back just the katsu and I told them how the mahi was and the cook showed me how the other pre-battered frozen pieces looked. The other cook gave me dirty looks and the two of them including the cashier was all talking Spanish which shows no ALOHA despite their name."}
{"text":"Placed order at 11:45 AM today. didn't get food until 1:20pm..  when i called the restaurant at 12:50 PM (already over an hour wait) they said the driver left 10 minutes ago..

so basically the food was sitting in the 110+ degree Vegas weather IN THE CAR for over 40 minutes before it arrived to my house..  i don't believe food that sits around for 40 minutes at least is okay to eat..

https://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/How_Temperatures_Affect_Food.pdf

Please read up on the danger zones of food temperatures.  they also made me drive and drop the food back off at the restaurant for a refund.

and tip for the restaurant.  if you are going to deliver food in a car for this long please use some sort of insulation to hold the food so it's not lukewarm on arrival and more importantly safe to eat...."}
{"text":"Great price and really good food. I've eaten here since I've been here in Vegas 3 days in a row, that's how good."}
{"text":"Yesterday I pre paid and made an order for 6:30 pm the next day , more than 24 hours. so it would hot as soon as I brought it back home for a party that's starts exactly at 7 pm and I live 20 min away,.My pre paid receipt  show's the pick up time
A 60 $ pre paid order and its not ready. 10 to 15 min what.Really, that's the normal wait. What was the point. Going back to L & L Barbeque . Further from me but better service."}
{"text":"I ordered the b1 combo. It's was ono. There teriyaki beef is cherry. Recommended place to grind."}
{"text":"This is the best plate lunch place in Vegas!  It is the closest to what you get back in Hawaii. Real local style Mac salad..spam fried noodles..real local style.  Ox tail soup ,ONO. Kalbi, katsu, Teri chicken..all good"}
{"text":"My favorite Hawaiian plate lunch in las Vegas. I live in the 215/ flamingo area and make this far drive to this location(sunset/pecos)  many  x's it's that good, jus like today for my pre game meal ( no I don't play sports anymore) , but still enjoy the pre game meal when Hawaii warriors play like they did today , good thing it was pre game cause if I waited I don't think I would have eaten, hawaii got killed :(,  anyway back to the highlight of my day. I got the B-1 mix plate ( chicken katsu curry, hamburger steak w brown gravy and Teri beef)  The chix katsu crispy not too hard to screw up , curry sauce good like how they do it in Hawaii  somewhere between an Indian and Japanese style curry. I only wish that they used chix thighs instead of breasts. Thighs r more juicy and tasty. Hamburger steak and gravy good and the Teri beef was flavorful like they marinated the meat in other seasonings not just shoyu, not like some other Hawaiian BBQ w / intials  L&L , plate comes w/ lotta rice and mac salad .  I also got a spam musubi , well alright I got 2 for half time snack. Musubi pretty standard spam , rice ,nori and drizzle of Teri sauce. $2.15 ea. Kinda expensive  . The mix plate just under $9 , for all the food u get ,worth it . Staff always friendly they also have one on Craig/Decatur I believe. They also make a pretty good ox tail soup.  Go warriors !!!"}
{"text":"Went here to pick up a quick lunch.  It was easy to find right off of Craig and Decatur in a strip mall.  The place is clean and well kept.  The girl at the counter that took our order was friendly and efficient.

We got the BBQ Mixed Plate and Chicken Katsu Plate to go.  The food was plentiful and tasty, However, I found the teriyaki beef to be quite salty and unusually garlicky.  The BBQ chicken and kalbi (Korean ribs) that is also part of the BBQ mix, were good.  The Katsu was also good.

This is as good as you can expect for the price.  So if you're craving some local Hawaiian grinds, this ain't a bad place to go.  Mahalo."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time had excellent food. The short ribs are my favorite. Nothing like grilled, marinated meat with white rice, some of the macaroni salad and a big soda. It's next level comfort food for me. The soup looked really good and I wish I was staying long enough to try that. It's on my must-go-to list every time I'm in Las Vegas. Also...it's really inexpensive! Try one of the fruit sodas they have in the cooler. They are also very Hawaiian. Friendly people, great food, fast service, and consistent quality."}
{"text":"When I want home style Hawaiian this is the place. Nothing fancy here but large portions of regular Hawaiian style ono grinds when I need that quick fix from my childhood.  It does the job! 4 star only because its not gourmet or fancy, but it's good regular Hawaiian take out- I love it."}
{"text":"I decided to give them another shot.. Services was a lot better this time around, food was good as usual, I'd just avoid the lunch and dinner rush and call your order in ahead of time."}
{"text":"Food wasn't flavorful, supposed to have teriyaki beef and chicken- no sauce in sight! Then tried the macaroni salad, glad I did and DIDN'T GET IT. Just not my cup of tea. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Been eating here for several years now. Not that it was fantastic food, more because L&L is a few more miles down the road in centennial.

Lately, their quality of food and service have gone significantly down.  I was born and raised in hawaii and i know authentic hawaiian bbq.  The owner has hired mexicans to work the register and cook to save a few bucks.  How on earth does a mexican know about hawaiian food? I would never call myself an excellent authentic mexican cook if i never spent a lifetime experiencing their culture.  But then, i looked at the owner and he is a \"FOB\" (FRESH OFF THE BOAT) asian that probably has no idea what true hawaiian culture is anyway.

Long story short, because the mexican help had trouble with my order they screwed up on it. I'm not saying that she did it on purpose, what i'm saying is the message got lost in translation.  However their service recovery sucked ass and implied the error was by the consumer. Same thing with the manager, and especially with the fob owner. Simple math could have solved the problem.

The food isn't bad, but the customer should never feel cheated after attempting a resolution. Drive the extra couple of miles to L&L in centennial, you will thank me later.

One last thing, if you were the fob owner, why would you really hire mexicans at your hawaiian bbq?  The only answer i can think of is to save money.  His chicken katsu is smaller, his mahi plates are smaller in portions. It is reasonable to believe, he is dying financially and is on survival mode.  Good luck to renewing your lease and spending all your life savings."}
{"text":"Although we have only been here once my husband and I were really impressed. I was excited to see the Moco Loco on the menu as its a traditional Hawaiian dish. My husband ordered the Hawaiian bbq beef with fried rice. We were both very pleased! Beware that the portion sizes are huge! I ordered a mini size and had left overs! Service was great as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The cashier was clean and polite. It was the only positive takeaway from my lunch experience yesterday. The chicken was old reheated chicken in sauce. It was precooked sliced slimy pieces about the size of a quarter and as thick as a poker chip, and not freshly cooked. The broccoli was actually amazingly bad. Not only did it have no flavor, but it looked dead. It was rubbery and it had wrinkles all over the stalks. It is not that it was overcooked, but rather very old wrinkled up broccoli tops before they were cooked. Absolutely zero flavor. The rice was old and parts were warm and moist and parts were dry and hard. I was the only customer. They had a chef who was wearing a filthy apron that looked like it had never been washed, and a prep guy who was clean. Out of three people working this establishment, they couldn't cook their only one customer, a nice simple order. It really pissed me off, thus why I made a note to make sure and write a review. I tipped as I ordered because I was short on time and couldn't go anywhere else and was prehorrified by the look of the chef, and hoped that would get me some quality food, but it had no impact. The service was fine, but the food literally could not have been worse."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend. I'm not too into Hawaiian BBQ so it was all new to me. I ended up going with the BBQ burger, I think it was called, with a fry. This burger was amazing! And the fries were really good too. My friend got the chicken katsu and that tasted great as well. The workers are very friendly and nice! If I'm ever in the mood for Hawaiian bbq I'd come here."}
{"text":"We just ate here today. Chicken Katsu is great. The BBQ meal was delicious. All meals have huge portions and the prices are reasonable! We have never had a bad experience here. And this place is busy all day.  I will definitely be going back because I want to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I have lived near and gone to this place for just over 6 years now. The quality has fluctuated as have the staff, but they have been 'good enough' and the close proximity has made it a place  I visit frequently. Today was the final straw for me. The quality of the chicken cutlet with gravy was terrible. It was like burnt chicken jerky (any cook willing to serve that cant be trusted). A side of Mac was ordered but instead of a extra side for my kid they just put the Mac from my meal on the side (lost in translation I guess). The steady decline in customer service but more importantly food quality means I now drive to Decatur and 215 to the Hawaiian place by Walmart.

If your going to go here you might get lucky but I would recommend going elsewhere. 

Thanks,
Nick

11-8-16 Edit.. Been back a couple times recently. The young girl there has been very sweet and nice and the food seems to be better so I figured I would edit my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Not authentic food. Got the shits 30 min later, i'm guessing from their room temp mac salad. If your are looking to lose weight and have a colon cleanse this is the place for you. thank got i didn't have to shits in their dirty bathroom. I think the bathroom is and indication how clean they keep their kitchen. Would you eat off of their bathroom?"}
{"text":"Whoever these people are, they don't know how to make fried rice.  They put so much soy sauce in the rice, it turned a dark brown color and it was very salty.  Ended up throwing most of it away."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Mac salad in Vegas I always order the BBQ mixed plate with the Portuguese sausage Musubi"}
{"text":"We had the Seafood and BBQ chicken combo plate and we are stuffed. It's plenty to share, my toddler loves the chicken and I have the seafood portion. Delivery was fast and our food arrived hot, saved me from cooking dinner after a long day at work. Thanks Aloha!"}
{"text":"I order from this place a lot due to limited options.  They deliver the food on time and the food is always satisfying.  The only thing that I find irritating is... They never get my order right.  GET IT RIGHT!"}
{"text":"Of the Hawaiian style restaurants that I have tried in Las Vegas, this is the best one.  I believe that if a restaurant's BBQ beef (teriyaki) is good, and theirs is very good, then they get my stamp of approval.  I have tried their laulau, kalua pig, mahi mahi, fried shrimp, fried noodles, oxtail soup, beef curry, pork cutlet, BBQ chicken, chicken cutlet, and chicken katsu, to name a few, and they are all great.  I like their kalbi since you can easily chew everything clean off the bones (a sign of well prepared kalbi).  They also give you ample portions so you don't leave hungry (try the fried noodles, they make me sleepy after eating the whole thing)."}
{"text":"Have ordered several times from Aloha Hawaiian BBQ and have ordered the following items: Hawaiian BBQ chicken, spam masubi, chicken katsu, Hawaiian burger, garlic shrimp and seafood combo.

The food is excellent however, inconsistent.  80% of the time the food is amazing but you have to risk the 20% when the food is so, so.  The price makes it well worth trying out."}
{"text":"This is a great place!! Food and service are great. Seems to be family run and that they care about the customer. Also helps that they have S.O.S playing on the radio. Go and eat!!!"}
{"text":"It was only within the last year that I have become aware of Hawaiian BBQ. I tried L&L with a friend, because it was close to my job, and while I found the meal tasty and adequate, nothing about it made a strong impression.

A few months later, I was working at a new job, in a new neighborhood. Again and again, my office mate strolls in with these delicious smelling lunches, and I would sneak a peak over his shoulder, trying to figure out what the source of these beautiful food aromas could be.

Finally, I asked him, and he produced a menu for Aloha Hawaiian BBQ. It was settled then that my next lunch would be from there. 

My first pick was the BBQ Mixed plate, and I haven't looked back since. I made a point to try almost everything on the menu. They have the best Macaroni Salad and Chicken Katsu I've ever eaten. The Pork, Beef and Seafood choices have all been great. 

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ sets the bar for Hawaiian food in LV."}
{"text":"I must preface this by first saying that I am not Hawaaiian. That aside, I do like food.

The teriyaki sauce in this place is to die for. Their teriyaki cheeseburger is one of my favorite burgers in town (even above In and Out). It's not too big, but it has tons of delicious flavor. And because it's the size of a burger that you'd probably make at home, you don't feel disgusting after eating it.

Their macaroni salad (not vegetarian safe) is creamy and very good. It has a small amount of tuna(I think) in it - and while that may sound gross, it's actually quite awesome. Just trust me.

Their short ribs are kind of fatty and I didn't like them very much, but everything else I have tried (including the gravy) is yummy."}
{"text":"Great place for local people. Not a destination by any means but it does served up so great food. 

I got the mini curry katsu. It was crispy and soft with enough curry just penetrating the exterior to soften it up a bit and really give it life. It comes with a very generous portion of rice and the always present macaroni salad. 

My girlfriend got the Chicken BBQ mahi mahi and shrimp combo. Lets say she could not finish it. A taste sensation? Sure if but to my honest opinion it's like the Hawaiian Soul food to be honest. Stick to your ribs food in it's pan fried, deep fried and BBQ-ed glory. 

Our tab ? under $20... You'll never spend more than $10 per person coming here.

There are usually two people manning the station up at the register. They are nice enough. The humongous 6 person T shirt adorns there walls. And Let's face it if you end up here ambiance wasn't what you were looking for in the first place. So stop by and get some Hawaiian classics. You might see me there for sure."}
{"text":"This place is a good restaurant, i agree. 
i go there during lunch when im around the area and it always hits the spot, good job."}
{"text":"Ordered the Curry Mix with Chicken Katsu, Hamburger Beef, and BBQ Steak, Spam Saimin, and Thai Tea. The food portions are large and for a great price. Fried rice is tasty. Mac salad is yummy and creamy with flavor. Large Thai Tea was really large, and just 3.00, for a 32 oz!!! Overall, a pretty great place for a great price. If you are looking for local desserts, not quite the place. They offer fried ice cream...no malasadas....or any kine of haupia pie.."}
{"text":"They say its Hawaiian but my taste buds disagree. 
Since my office is right across the street, I find myself dining here far too frequently. In fact, almost daily.
My eager lunch companion enjoys trying a variety of things off the menu. Yesterday he tried the Caribbean Shrimp ($8.95) which he enjoyed. And ever since he tried the Chicken Katsu Musabi a few weeks back, he seems to order one each visit. My options are limited since I dont eat meat, but the steamed rice is really cheap (.60) and they just recently added steamed broccoli to the menu!! 
The star of the show is the \"Sauce Station\" as we like to call it. This consists of a couple bottles of soy, teriyake, rooster sauce and ketchup on a rack which is also equipped with little plastic to-go containers. Many of inventive concoctions have been created on that rack. The service is OK, the place is clean and everything is dirt cheap. So if you're just looking to fill your belly on the fly, you could do worse."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but this place has gone down hill drastically. The teriyaki sauce tastes like vinegar! The chicken is dry and chewy! The macaroni is the worst! I used to love this place! Even the crab Rangoon's taste like cardboard! 
Terrible! Do not order from here."}
{"text":"Only place i will ever order loco moco....the best i ever tried here in las vegas nothing compares tried other places this place tops it."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. The Musubi is amazing. The Bar-B-Que Mixed is melt in your mouth good."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Katsu in Las Vegas!!! To die for. Almost everything they have is great. Love the mac salad."}
{"text":"When I really think about it..I realize how many ways can you make spam musubi? its relatively simple, but although its simple, to me its addicting i don't know, i think i just have this craze for SPAM!!..anyways..i've tasted it at many places, when i ate here, it was good, nothing spectacular but good...what I was really amazed was with the Oxtail Soup. It was real good. This little place served really good oxtail, almost as good as the one at the California Hotel, You know the one they serve for 7.95$ but only as a graveyard special. Yeah that good, except this one was 1$ dollar more, but available all day. So I tip my hat to them for making good oxtail soup..but i give it 3 stars b/c I haven't tried anything else lol"}
{"text":"Great food!  Since we moved a couple of years ago, I've been looking for Hawaiian BBQ near by, that won't break the bank and yet be satisfying and this place fits the bill.  Service was pretty good, but the food was over all very good.  Only downside was the BBQ beef I had with my mix plate.  Extremely salty.  Terriyaki chicken and Kalbi ribs were really good and I love their Macaroni salad.  Thank you for a good option close to home."}
{"text":"I feel like you can't go wrong here. For such a good price and portion, you'll definitely conquer your lunch time hunger or situate a time crunch for dinner. Here you will find all the chicken katsu, Hawaiian BBQ beef, shortribs, spam masubis, and more. They even have loco moco here too. In your order you'll find that rice and macaroni salad is included as well. My favorite thing here is the chicken katsu curry, and I usually order a half box. The half box of anything here is huge! Its a lot more than you think it would be.
What I really like is how fast they are. I normally order to-go, and they are such a life saver when I'm running around doing errands or need a quick pit stop."}
{"text":"I love this place! They give big portions and it tastes so so good! I love that they have their teriyaki sauce out so you can get as much as you need. Thanks for being great!"}
{"text":"I recently got hit by the poverty freight train. But, I had to come here and check it out. This great restaurant has been here for years, I now know why. The bbq mix plate is delicious. I paid a little over $10.00, but the plate is plentiful, lots of juicy meat. I am in heaven right now."}
{"text":"Great little Hawaiian bbq joint. The only reason I didn't give 5 star is that I expect Hawaiian music to be playing in the background of a Hawaiian BBQ place and there was not toilet paper or seat covers in the women's restroom. The food was great! The Garlic Shrimp and Spam Musubi remind me of time spent in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Well, this place was disappointing to say the least. I had the loco moco and my lady had the seafood mix plate. I am from the big island and I have \"my\" restaurants I go too for that local food itch. I decided to take a gamble when I was in the area and man was I upset. as far as the seafood mix plate goes the scallops were ok. as for my loco moco, it was kinda lame. if you can't make a simple hawaiian dish then there is no reason to try anything else. the loco moco had frozen patties, ill give them some credit as they tried to season the patties with salt and pepper. the gravy was on the bland side and the mac salad had a flavor that was not a familiar taste. The fact that frozen patties, bland gravy, and mac salad thats not up to par is what they serve is enough for me to stay away. hint there is was better restaurants in the area for the same price."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot on their menu because I normally stick to the same thing but everything I have tried is good. Sometimes things are better then other times but it's never bad. I normally get chicken musubi and always good. I have also got the chicken plate with Mac and rice and I haven't had any problems there aside from the chicken sometimes being dry. I ordered a burger and fries and the fries were soggy but it was delivery so I understand. All and all pretty inexpensive and good food."}
{"text":"They are a favorite of mine moved here from Hawaii 4 yrs ago. Lived there all my life. No one does it better by far then aloha bbq. I even catered their food for my wedding in april they deliver quick! The best no doubt!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Sahara location, but gave this location and shot and I'm not sure if I'll be visiting them all together again.
Ordered the shrimp + beef curry combination, the cashier punched the order correctly, but they gave me the wrong order. I'm not a picky eater so I was okay with it. 

The curry tasted old....
The freshest thing from the combo was the hamburger patty. 

Store hours are amazing if you're trying to eat late night, but you'd be better off eating fast food since you'd know you get fresher food."}
{"text":"I order lunch here pretty regularly and every time it's fucking awesome. The food is great, portions are nice, prices are good. The Chicken Katsu Curry Plate is probably my favorite thing here so far, they also have a surprisingly great cheeseburger and fries"}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian Food nearby, very good prices. We love the bbq chicken saimin and their breakfast and spam misubi. But order to go bc the dining area and ceilings are dirty and dusty."}
{"text":"So-So. if you have never had hawaiian bbq than you might like it. but im from SD and i love it here and this place just fell short. staff is friendly and choices are large its just ok though"}
{"text":"Normal Hawaiian restaurant. Food is good but nothing too special. It's conveniently located by my school so my classmates & I eat here like once a month. 

Thai tea is good. Boba not so much. It's not soft and chewy like it should be. The middle is still kind of hard and I've ordered boba twice thinking it was just a 1 time thing but no."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is okay. I tried the oxtail soup the last time I was there and it was very good. I gave the place 3 stars because the lady that works there, each time I have been there is VERY rude."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try more recently. Is have to say that it's definitely improved. Food is good. Not bad prices. Only issue it's still the sauces, off you want extra on the side, they charge. But if they put it on the food, they don't charge."}
{"text":"Being stationed in Hawaii years ago I was used to another popular Hawaiian BBQ spot but have been disappointed lately. Drove past this place while lost after moving to Henderson from Spring Valley, stopped in and was very impressed with the food. Ordered the bbq beef, katsu chicken was a bit bland w/o the sauce and the mahi mahi was actual fish. They deliver, not sure if I'm range but this is indeed my new Hawaiian BBQ spot."}
{"text":"Good food.may be I was hungry.Hardly go to north side.Just like north side of honolulu Hawaii.Finished service there.Give them a try not bad a all.I will come by next time around there.
Food good.service good.aloha spirit.
Whats up braddah!"}
{"text":"I just write a review the other store at north las vegas one.So I going to review this one.food is good. oxtail soup must a try. I want More peanut,I love peanut.The I have to say is 3 yrs ago.I went to see the stadium football.There iwas hawaii football team there.Lot of ALOHA.
Show your tattoo.Braddah"}
{"text":"My husband wanted Mexican, I did not. Lucky for us, this place is right next to a Mexican place. 

I walked in and was greeted warmly right away. I placed my order and did not wait long at all to receive my meal. Since we ordered at 2 different places, we decided to get both to go so we could eat together at home. 

I got my meal home and was anticipating a great meal as the wonderful aroma. 

The meal tasted a little off compared to what I am used to - so it was a little less appetizing, but still okay. It was also a little greasy. 

So, funky taste and overly greasy, which is no bueno for my tum-tum."}
{"text":"This place is really good food priced very reasonably. We've went twice and will definitely go back. Please check out the picture I posted of the \"SUGER\" shaker always a good laugh but who cares when the food so good it broke the mouf!!! Haole's unite, this place is tight!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh cooked-to-order, quality ingredients make for flavorful Hawaiian folk fare and the service is especially attentive. All-in for a positive Hawaiian Drive-in Experience.  I'll be back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've had the food here before and it's amazing but the customer service is horrible. I just waited in line for about 15 minutes to place my order and when I finally reached the front I was told I could not order because they closed 4 minutes ago. A good business would have accepted customers that were in line."}
{"text":"At here today for lunch. Food is pretty good but the service was slow for the amount of customers they had. Should consider adding additional staff."}
{"text":"i ate here last night. super; very good. i had the Hawaiian BBQ beef with 2 vegetable egg rolls... yummy! great food and the people are very nice. i will go here again ASAP with my boyfriend. have fun!"}
{"text":"Picked the half and half. BBQ short ribs and chicken katsu. I feel like if I order it to go they give you more rice and macaroni salad. 
It's funny that they have this shirt hanging. It looks like a 20x. All I know is the tag is so large in the back you can see it was made one good ol' USA. Who knows what size it really is. But it's cool."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken BBQ plate mini version. Good amount of food for about 7 bucks after taxes. If you get the regular plate, you get even more food! 

The chicken had a great flavor and the rice was cooked well. I even liked the macaroni salad. ( which I am very picky about ) 

This place is really close to my house so I'm sure I'll be cooking back for lunch or dinner again :)"}
{"text":"I love the Mac salad, and good fried rice, people are cool there"}
{"text":"Unless you live in the area, I wouldn't really recommend coming here. As soon as you walk in, there is a strong sewer-like smell that permeates the entire restaurant. Everything is a little shabby, and the workers are Chinese and Mexican rather than local people from Hawaii (not discriminating, but the difference is apparent because nobody smiles at you).

Food is pretty standard. I had a bbq mixed plate with kalbi, shrimp and beef. Nothing terrible but nothing to write home about. The appearance of the restaurant makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen, but let's not think about that!

Bottom line: if there's another Hawaiian food place near you, I would definitely go there instead. This place needs someone with aloha to bring it back to life."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a late breakfast/early lunch upon it opening at exactly 1030 am. We had the following:

Bento Chef Special
Chicken, beef, mahi and fried shrimp.
$10.95

Seafood and BBQ Combo Plate
BBQ short rib, BBQ beef or BBQ chicken or katsu with mahi mahi and fried shrimp.
$9.75

All the food tasted great. The fried mahi and shrimp were perfectly cooked and not greasy at all with not too much batter. The chicken and beef were excellent too. I give this place 5 stars bc it reminded me of Loco Moco's resto back home in Hawaii. It was like eating Hawaiian comfort food that I grew up on. Will come back here again whenever I feel homesick...Oh ya, portions are pretty big here too."}
{"text":"I will have to say this place was very delicious. I am visiting from North Carolina and I love Hawaiian BBQ. I found this place on Yelp and it didn't have many stars and usually I am ify about that, but we walked in and the woman at the front was very nice. Her suggestions on what to get were very precise. I had the beef and chicken saimin which tasted amazing. This will definitely be one of my go to restaurants for something quick and delicious."}
{"text":"First thing you're going to notice is the giant aloha shirt pinned to the wall.  Most places offer a free entree or meal when you frequently eat there.  I'm sure if you eat here often enough they might just give you that shirt. LOL JK they probably wont do that, someone should ask though.

Anyways I got to give Aloha Hawaiian BBQ a 3.5 Rating.  Food quality and taste sometimes are really good but sometimes it's just OK.  Way better than the chain Hawaiian restaurants that's all over Vegas but still could improve.  Their menu doesn't have everything I sometimes want or something special that stands out but it does has a decent selection of local Hawaiian/Asian dishes, the basics at least are there and are good. Prices are a little more than what I'm use to so I do tend to pass by and go else where.  

Back when I lived in the area I would almost always get my quick Hawaiian fix on here.  I would always swing by after playing bball at the nearby Sunset Park or even just pickup food and enjoy it at Sunset Park.

Their mac salads are a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Oxtail soup not good.. Meat is not fresh and the korean guy in the cashier need to get fired he doesn't know what the hell he doing I order to dine inn and he came out to wrano my food to go the same as the customer ahead of me and he take lots of smoke break.. Not coming back.."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I really don't ....

Big portions don't mean it's good food. But, my family, who lives there in Las Vegas tends to think so. I guess if you pour enough shoyu or chili pepper water on something, you can't taste how bland something is. And that's what I thought about the food my family picked up for a small gathering at my mom's house. 

Chicken katsu, fried noodles and teriyaki. Lots of food - gotta give them that. But it stops there. Katsu was not crispy on the outside or moist on the inside. Damp is the word that comes to mind. Teriyaki was overdone. Looked ok at first glance but at first bite, overcooked. Fried noodles was ok. Frying noodles is hard to mess up, like cooking rice. For my taste though, the noodles could have used a little more salt and or shoyu. 

To each their own - some may like it because they don't know any better. Others may like it because it's all they can get now. Me, I don't and won't settle because I can and will just fly home if I want to have authentic, Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"Today I only tried the Thai iced tea and fried ice cream I had to cure my sweet tooth. 

The Thai iced tea was good and Im still sipping on it now BUT the fried ice cream was a disaster! It was a thick ball of fried crust I opened it up an out poured nothing but melted ice cream WHAT A BUMMER yuck I will never ever order that again."}
{"text":"Pork cutlet is bomb!  My other choice is BBQ mic plate!  And gotta have my Thai iced tea!"}
{"text":"I like the BBQ mix .I t is delicious. I go there several times. I like their food.best Hawaiian food. And have deliverly order."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a meal, couple musubis and some Thai Tea. The service here is terrible. The lady at the counter is very rude and is very unwelcoming. She has no patience and also doesn't explain things well. The musubis were below average. They weren't even served to me hot and the rice and seaweed were hard. Also I realized there was no sauce in my musubi after it fell apart while I was eating it which explains the lack of flavor I noticed while eating them. The Thai tea was okay. It tasted funny and reminded me of the cheap ones you could buy in the small glass bottles."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service experience. Female cashier with the scowl face is extremely rude. I wish it was possible to eat the food then poop it out and leave it on her doorstep.

Ps. While waiting for my order, I almost stopped myself from posting this but now she's walking around the dining room and kitchen coughing wildly with her mouth uncovered."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and this place is just not that good. If you're looking for authentic Hawaiian food, this will definitely be a disappointment. 

First, the staff aren't really attentive or helpful. They kind of just take your order. No personality and not very welcoming. 

For foods, the chicken Katsu that I've ordered a few times had a very bland taste to it. The outer coating was more soggy then  anything. The sauce for the Katsu had a different taste to what I'm used to. It has a very watery texture to it. It comes with Mac salad which taste like pure mayonnaise and on the salty side. 

You probably wonder why I've ate here a \"few\" times like i mentioned in the beginning if I didn't like it. Well, the beau kinda likes this place and it's pretty close to his house so it's convenient when we need something quick and close by. 

But def not my \"to go\" Hawaiian joint."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 star I would. Waited 2hours 45 minutes for delivery. I understand places get busy however each time I called to see status I was told each time it's out for delivery and 10 minutes you'll get food. Well they said that to me 3 times. Good thing I used Eat24 because they were told the same thing 3 times also and it is documented. Eat24 took care of me and applied a major discount and stayed on the phone with me for 48 minutes after they were told 10 minutes for delivery after they called to see what is happening. Very bad customer service for Aloha. Don't tell your customers what sounds good to make them feel ok. Luckily E24 verified you lied. I hope maybe on future deliveries for other customers you provide a microwave for the stone cold food you think is ok to serve. Manager on duty was very rude. Seemed like I was an inconvenience for checking on order. Your business is not needed in Vegas. The least you could have done was offered a discount for the hassle yet E24 had to do what you wouldn't. Your manager told E24 they won't apply anything what a sad sad way to fix a problem. Never again will I order from here or even eat there. Thanks to E24 though for helping a guy and his kids out!"}
{"text":"Ono comfort food and quick delivery service. Love that their hamburger patties are home-made but the LauLau could use some work. Other than that though, the fam loves this place!"}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed; whoever entered $$$ for Aloha mistyped.  This is a casual, order-at-the-counter place with a good take-out business and 8 tables for eat-in.  Prices are very reasonable, with most entrees averaging around $6-$7.  

It's clean and nicely decorated, with bright yellow paint and a giant Hawaiian shirt on the wall.  The menu offers a wide variety of Hawaiian specialties like kalua pork, katsu and other curry, a few shrimp dishes, saimin and fried saimin noodles, etc.  My personal favorite, and the one I ordered while there,  is loco moco: hamburg patties topped with a rich, brown gravy and fried egg over white rice.  Macaroni salad on the side.  It was delish, just like in Hawaii.  Best of all, many entrees come in a mini version, less food and less cost. Hawaiian food can be kinda heavy, so the mini option should be much appreciated."}
{"text":"Quick service and good value for the price.  Ordered lunch and left with some leftovers.  Tasty first experience with Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"I was getting my car serviced and decided to eat here. I ordered the spam fried saimin and mini kalua pork. They give good volume for the price and I was happy with that. It doesn't seem too busy though. When I went there was no one there and the cooks was just sitting down on one of the tables."}
{"text":"All around great!! 

I've picked up orders, eaten in, and delivery. All are fabulous! 

Great prices, delicious food! Highly recommend to anyone. Clean environment as well as a kind and friend staff!!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me there for lunch/breakfast, he is from Hawaii and I figured he knew his stuff, i had the Portuguese sausage and eggs which was excellent, I actually liked the sausage better than    
L N L but anyway the food is great and i have been back 3 times since and every time i have been pleasantly surprised of the level of quality and clean conditions, i would recommend this to family and friends and travelers, come by for some Ohana food."}
{"text":"I wanted something different, something I'm used to from home.  First thing that popped in my head was eating at a Hawaiian place, but I didn't feel like driving down Rainbow to get it.  i was on my way to get my husband for lunch when I saw this place in the same strip mall near an Albertsons.  I figured, \"why not?\" and went inside.

It's fairly small so there isn't much seating, but from the looks of things people order take out A LOT.  That's a good sign.  I checked out their menu, and it's nice and simple.  It's the same menu I've seen at several Hawaiian bbq restaurants around town, so I went for the usual chicken katsu with steamed rice and my husband ordered fried shrimp and their seafood platter.  

Despite having several dozen options for Hawaiian bbq around town, this one is now on my list of favorites.  Their fried foods are awesome and not greasy like some places, and their batter has great flavor.  I love panko breaded anything, and their katsu and fried seafood is all panko.  I loved that their katsu sauce, whether it's from a bottle or not, is sweeter than the other places, but still has that nice tangy finish with a bit of heat.  

We tried their kalua pig and other things on the menu a few days after and it was all good, even when doing take out.  Their mac salad is good, too, and different because they add tuna in theirs.  They are known for their oxtail soup, which I will try eventually.  Overall, it's a great stop for some good Hawaiian fast food.  I actually prefer them over the other places around the northwest area.  

Clean, friendly. and fast.  They may not have the dessert menu that some other Hawaiian bbq places have, but do you really go there for the cake and ice cream?  No. You go there for a simple, fast meal that's good, and they do it well.

Stop by and try out their food.  Some people may argue that it's like the other Hawaiian bbq places because of the menu, but this place tastes better, cleaner, and less greasy.  That, and their employees give great service.

Give this place a try if you live in the area.  I know the location looks fishy because of the stores next to it and it's in this tiny strip mall building, but it is good.  I even questioned myself because I tend to stay away from places like that...at least, I used to.  I've learned that these places, despite location, can fork out some of the best food you will eat in Vegas, so give it a try.  

Aloha!"}
{"text":"The food used to be much better, but now its  just kinda BLAH ! It needs more flavor and their portions have jus gotten waaay skimpier."}
{"text":"Oooo-wee. Katsu is nice and juicy in the inside, perfectly crisp on the outside. This place isn't a thai place, but I dig there thai tea with boba! They cook fast too! My husband enjoys there oxtail soup.. and their fried rice.. and their loco moco... and well everything. You can probably tell that we don't mind coming here often ;)"}
{"text":"Hawaiian BBQ beef was SOOO delicious, the BBQ Mixed plate was extremely good eating, the macaroni salad that comes with the plates is creamy and very tasty as well, Deep Fried Shrimp Udon my son had have LOVED it! Manapua  so yummy had we ordered 2! We also had large thai tea with boba were HUGE they do not skimp on portions and the prices are very reasonable. We love Aloha Hawaiian BBQ. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Very inexpensive food with great portions and on top of that everything I have tried has been very tasty.  Highly recommend the Spicy Korean Chicken bowl."}
{"text":"I've been on a massive Loco Moco kick the last couple months, and find myself constantly craving it. I work right by this Aloha location and with really no other places in the area, I've stopped here a couple times after work to somewhat satisfy my craving. One of my least favorite things about this place is the feel of it. It's not necessarily dirty, but it's definitely run down, and looks like the staff gives it very little attention. I realize it's more or less of a fast food joint, but at least try to make it look inviting so people will want to eat here.

The staff is another downer for Aloha. Each time I've been in here, everyone just looks miserable. There's really no smiles or welcomes, and if you ask them questions, it's like you're pulling teeth. They've also got a cook in the back who always seem to be screwing off and messing with the other staff. Maybe he owns the place, I don't know, but he kind of just seems to do whatever he wants. 

Obviously you aren't going to come here for 5 star service, so let's talk about the food. While I'm not an expert on Hawaiin food by any means, I think this place is ok and has a couple decent things to offer. My craving for loco mock isn't completely satisfied, but their version holds me over pretty well. I like that their hamburger patty appears to be hand made and has a decent seasoning on it's own. It's tender, not dry at all and their gravy isn't bad either. Besides being a little on the watery said, it has solid flavor and isn't overly salty. The rice they use is as plain jane as it comes, but they at least cook the egg right, and it makes for an overall tasty plate of food. And their portions are huge! Their \"Mini\" is only $6.15 and is plenty for me. If you're super hungry, try their \"Regular\" for only $8.15 and if you finish it, you'll probably be sickly full.

Both my son and I enjoy the spam musubi as well. It's got a slightly sweet sauce that pairs well with the salty spam, and for only $2.15 you get a nice size piece that is perfect for a little snack or side. Since their macaroni salad is extremely salty and has a strong mayo taste, I'd ask if they can just uncharge and swap it out for spam musubi instead on my next visit though. 

There are a couple things I wouldn't recommend trying, but these are probably givens being that it's basically fast food. Their fried mahi-mahi is pretty bad, and even my 6 year old, who loves almost all seafood, just couldn't eat it. He did like the fried shrimp however, which wasn't nearly as bad, but probably not something I'd order again for myself.

For what Aloha Hawaiin BBQ is, I don't think it's bad, but it's not great. The loco moco alone is decent enough for me to come back when I get the craving and I'm nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Overall, it's \"A-OK\"!"}
{"text":"Hit this place up or lunch a few times a month. Pretty typical Hawaiian BBQ joint, nothing outstanding but nothing bad. Hits the spot when I'm having a plate lunch craving."}
{"text":"I came here because I was craving some local food. As soon as I walked in it reminded me of L & L, claiming to be local food but made by non locals. I ordered the mini chicken katsu, Kalbi and Portuguese sausage fried rice. The fried rice was a dark brownish/black color almost as if the whole thing was coated with shoyu or some kind of teriyaki sauce. Not much sausage in it either. Kalbi would of been good if it was authentic Korean sauce used back home in Hawaii. This sauce was pure shoyu. The chicken katsu was ok. The katsu sauce tasted like it came out of a bottle but was edible. 

All in all I will probably not return here. There is really nothing Hawaiian here. The food is from Hawaii but the flavor is not."}
{"text":"Prices reasonable and quick service.  I had samin, which was really tasty and received a good portion. I would have preferred it served in a bowl to enjoy at the location than a deep styrofoam cup.  And Hawaiian music would have been nice to hear in the background."}
{"text":"Stop in here for lunch and after checking out the menu I decided to go with the barbecue chicken and noodle plate.

The portion size was ginormous for the regular size plate and the chicken tasted pretty flavorful. The noodles on the other hand were pretty bland tasting. 

The food came out quick and they also had several different spicy condiments, which I'm a huge fan of.

Over all a pretty average place to dine."}
{"text":"Was on my way to a friends house and I was Starvin' Marvin!

So I pulled out my trusty phone and started up the yelp app.  I craved some Hawaiian BBQ and looked it up.  This place is nestled conveniently on Pecos and Sunset.

The girl who took my order was super friendly and the food came out very quickly.  In under 5 minutes it seemed like!  

I ordered take out and hoped for the best!  

The food was great. Rice was perfect, The Chicken and Beef were good.  I was one satisfied guy afterwards. 

I particularly liked the place. It was clean, had plenty of seating and they were super friendly.  The food was ono-licious so I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I had been craving for a good Loco Moco and came here from a friend's recommendation. Loco Moco is the simplest Hawaiian dish (it's just rice, burger patty and fried egg smothered with brown gravy), but it's a hard dish to master. So having lived in Hawaii and having the best Loco Moco there (Blaine's in Hilo), here's me picking apart the loco moco:

Rice: There's a layer of oil at the bottom. Eek.
Patty: It's a bit soggy; I wish it's done a bit firmer.
Egg: Ok. Good runny yolk.
Brown gravy: Good.

Also, I judge how good a Hawaiian place is by their mac salad. It's another one of those dishes that are simple but hard to make it perfect. For this place, just skip the mac salad. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best Macaroni salad I've had in my life. Would not recommend the fries. Everything else is good."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service; both done in and delivery !
Family owned and they care about their customers satisfaction!"}
{"text":"I have been to probably four or five hawaiian bbq places in my 29 years of life including this bad boy. I must say that, from my experiences, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is atop the list. 

Before I begin, I want to start off by saying I wouldn't take my opinion on hawaiian food as seriously as the big, tattooed guy with black beads around his neck that lives down the block. I know good food and I know good prices. Aloha has both.

Today I purchased the 'Bar-B-Que Mixed' that was only 8 bucks. This meal consisted of fried rice, macaroni salad, BBQ short rib, BBQ chicken, and BBQ beef. The portions were fair for the price of admission and all of the meats had a distinct sweet / teriyaki flavor. If you are anything like me, teriyaki = mouth orgasm. From what their website says, the chicken, kalbi, and beef are marinaded in teriyaki before going on the grill. If you can complain about that, you will NEVER be a friend of mine.

Since I ordered my meal over the phone to go, I can't comment on the cleanliness of the restaurant or the service inside in detail. From what I saw, however, the restaurant was clean and the man who helped me was friendly and knew the menu. 

In the end, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ will be my place to go in Las Vegas for Hawaiian BBQ. The only reason I gave the place a 4 out of 5 is due to the fact that there can always be room for improvement (especially in price) and the meat was, in fact, a little bit thin and gummy (but I still assure you ; tasty).  

If you are in Las Vegas and want to escape to Hawaii for the duration of a meal, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ might just be your place."}
{"text":"Dirty tables and floors. I had to wipe our table myself. The male employee was just looking at me while I was doing his job. A good employee would at least feel guilty and would immediately do something. He was on his phone most of the time. I wonder how they handle their food if they can't even ensure the cleanliness of their place. That being said, I definitely would not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly. I've been going here for years... and I've pretty much seen the same lady work behind the counter. 

The gravy is to die for! It helps if you get it on the side... the give you so much more!!

Super friendly and the food is delicious!! A lot more reasonable in price than other hawaiian bbq places in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Ate here many times over the years. It's different now. Hamburger Steak is made with frozen hamburger patties and not even the good ones. Tastes like a carnival hamburger with gravy on it. No grilled onions either. Manapua is also the frozen kind you get at Ranch 99 Store. Mac salad was decent but it's probably store bought also. 

Need to find a new place with fresh not frozen food."}
{"text":"I have been wanting Aloha for awhile so I finally came and I must say I should have went elsewhere. The cashier has zero personality and is rude. Its the little things that matter, a smile, a simple how are you?, or maybe not throwing my credit card on the counter. I'm hoping my food is better than her attitude -_-"}
{"text":"Food is pretty average. Service is great, staff are nice. Quality is lacking in my view."}
{"text":"This place is NOT GOOD. First off, I asked one of the employees to wipe down our table before we sat down and he wiped it down with a dirty ass wet cloth which made the table feel sticky. The quality and flavor of the food is POOR. I'm from Hawaii, so I know what garlic shrimp and shrimp curry is supposed to taste like (which is what we ordered) and it tasted awful. Nothing like the real thing. Garlic shrimp isn't even hard to make in the first place?! Then when we got our drink, there were black particles in the ice. Thinking it may have been mold. Their floors are filthy. This place is just straight up disgusting. I'm very disappointed that I spent $30 here. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Dining area is disgusting.

I dont know how the got an A from the food and health department. 

They probably paid for it.

Order took more than 25 mins. I might never come back"}
{"text":"Pretty much your run-of-the-mill Hawaiian BBQ joint; very reminiscent of an \"L&L type place\".  It's got all the local favorites on the menu like saimin, chicken katsu, and mahi mahi among others.  I usually opt for the seafood combo plate when I come here and usually do not stray much further from that.  It includes fried shrimp, mahi mahi, and fried scallops with rice and a scoop of mac salad.  However, the mac salad isn't anything to write home about and the dipping sauce for the mahi mahi leaves much to be desired.  Aside from that, the service is nice and the staff is pretty friendly.  I'll be back to grub on my usual plate but only when I'm in the general vicinity and not distracted by other food choices in area."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place but it's gone downhill the fried rice is terrible .. I can't comment on other dishes and selections but I will  not eat here again!!"}
{"text":"We went to Aloha Hawaiian BBQ for lunch on Sunday.  We had the Chicken Cutlet.  The Gravy was ONO.  The BBQ Mix plate.  The BBQ Chicken.  BBQ bowl and spam musubi.  Have to say it was delicious.  Why can I say that...When we go the food there was no noise from us we were too busy eating.  Fast service and good food.  Very good we will come back soon."}
{"text":"I might not be biased enough because I've never had Hawaiian BBQ before, but I thought it was good. I had the advertised Oxtail Soup, which was really good (but very hot when I got it, burnt the tongue). My friend got the bbq beef, which I tried a bite and liked it. They come as a meal; mine came with rice, and I ordered macaroni salad, which was good but I had to take home due to eyes bigger than the stomach thing. Nice little small restaurant, I would definitely be coming back at some point."}
{"text":"We went to Aloha Hawaiian BBQ for dinner to go. My husband wanted the Short Ribs. Despite 2 cooks in the kitchen, they were super slow waited 25 mins for one plate to go. This review loses one star for length of time for food to be done. I will call the order in next time. My husband loves the food from here as he had eaten here before. It was my 1st time. Cute restaurant with seating to eat in. Unique decor: Huge Aloha shirt on the wall with Hawaiian photographs. This restaurant is on the corner of Decatur and Craig.  This is good Hawaiian good plate lunch style!"}
{"text":"Yummy! My boyfriend and I love this place! We could eat here everyday! It is a little out of our way, but worth the drive! We get huge amounts of food! Even when you get a mini, it is a huge amount! Try it out! You will love it."}
{"text":"Really good food! My friend love her teriyaki chicken said you can even taste a hint of ginger. The catsu chicken was also amazing. Would have gotten 5 stars of my tai tea was actually cold when it was served and the floor was swept Better. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"After work I took my dogs to sunset park... Two hours later I was hungraaaaay. I've been craving Hawaiian food, especially spam musubi. Yelped what was close by and found this place. Ordered spam musubi and the bbq combo plate along with a cold guava beverage.

Holy smokes, the spam musubi was finger licking good, I devoured it within seconds. The bbq combo plate included rice, short ribs, chicken, beef and Mac salad... Everything was amazing. My favorite was the Mac salad and beef short ribs. Mmmm mm. Friendly staff and cozy restaurant. The menu had a huge selection from different musubis, oxtail soup, garlic shrimp etc. Defiantly will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The place itself is small and slightly older but the food is great. I also love the fact that they stay open as late as 930pm. I ate here with my husband and we got the BBQ mix plate. It was sooo delicious! The food certainly hit the spot. I substituted the BBQ chicken with chicken Katsu and it was on point! So thank you for satisfying my taste buds and my stomach. 

I didn't get to take a look at the rest of the menu but I look forward to trying other dishes here. I recommend this place to all who have island food cravings. 

:)"}
{"text":"Small little place in a strip mall with good food and friendly service.  The teri beef is tender and has a good flavor evident from true a true overnight marinade.  Most places will not properly marinate resulting in more or a bland flavor.

The Saimin noodles is probably the best in the valley at a Hawaiian joint.  Flavorful soup base and tender ramen noodles.

I fancy the B-1 mixed plate - hamburger steak/teri beef/curry"}
{"text":"I wish zero stars available because that's what they justly deserve my mother personally witnessed the cook not washing his hands and handling the chicken with his bare hands after touching beef his hands went into the drawer and grabbed the chicken but before she could say anything the cook dropped a piece of chicken from someone else's order picked it up again with his bare hands and threw it into the to go container.  That is so unsanitary and literally gross mishandling of food I will never ever go there again nor will remain closed mouth about it.  I cannot imagine why they thought it was acceptable but it appeared that he didn't look around or sneak so he must do it a lot !! Be warned!"}
{"text":"We ordered spam fried rice, chicken katsu and a BBQ chicken plate it was all very very good. REAL very very good. It was so very good that I loved it. I just ordered more food from there again, for delivery through EAT 24 and I can't wait. I got chicken fried rice this time and the Loco moco beef plate! It's Hawaiian hamburger patties with fried eggs and brown gravy and it comes with white rice and macaroni salad. I'm very excited."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries in the valley.  I eat here a lot.  Everything's fresh and fast.  It's like home cooking to me. 

Heading there now!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to go when I crave for local grindz"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for good Hawaiian food closer to home than what I currently am aware of.  Aloha Hawaiian BBQ I have found to be the closest.  It is pretty much like most all the other Hwaiian restaurants out here.  In fact, they all start looking alike after so long.  And the food is all about the same.  

On this visit I ordered a Katsu 1/2 plate (one scoop of rice vs two).  It came with the katsu, rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  You know, the classics.  I also got another clcassic in Spam Musubi.  That is kind of my basic judge of a Hawaiian Restaurant.  I did not have to wait too long to receive my food.  Just long enough to witness the interaction between the cashier and the next party of customers.  All of them were of Asian background.  Their speaking to each other sounded almost angry at times.  As if they were yelling at each other.  I think I even heard them arguing on price.  Maybe it is a cultural thing.  I don't know.  It was kind of entertaining regardless.  

Any how, I got my food to go and took it home to eat in peace.  At leastsome of the food made it home.  I took a big risk in trying to eat the musubi on the road.  I did OK.  The nori was tender enough that it was not a chore to bite through.  This helped to hold in the Spam where in some cases it slides right out the other side on bite one.  What bothered me just enough to reall is the sauce on this musubi.  I am used to a more teriyaki style sauce.  This was more like a hoisin with a mildly spicy kick.  It was not necessarily bad just not what I had expected.  As for the katsu plate when I got home, it was hit and miss.  The katsu and sauce were on point.  The rice was as good as sticky white rice can be.  The macaroni salad was not great.  Half of it was burried beneath the rice and getting warm.  It was a little gross.  The final impression was that the chicken was not on a bed of shredded cabbage like at L&L but rather on a bed of shredded lettuce that wilts whe in contact with hot fried chicken.  Not the most appetizing of garnishes.

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is not going to be my number one go-to but for a quick go-to close to home, it does the trick."}
{"text":"Do not come here at all The food is mediocre. The establishment is gross and because of that we did end up seeing cockroaches there. Which Made me and my family Lose our appetites. Terrible That they cannot just Clean the place up Something like that should be a top priority in a restaurant. Disgusting"}
{"text":"For it not being busy and phone ordered. It still took a while. No more then 10 people in here and the cooks seem to be panicking. Food taste good but the wait was not worth it.... SMH NOT TO MENTION THEY GOT MY ORDER WRONG. I got home craving some Kalua Pig n BBQ chicken. I got a Lau Lau plate instead. I should of double checked!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the cashier is always nice. Cleanliness and the way they handle food is a big no no. You can literally see the dirt on the grout that hasn't been cleaned since who knows? And you can honestly see the difference of clean vs dirty on the wall tile and floor for comparison. One of them meant in the back prepping food was handling raw meat with his bare hands and touching other things around him. Their Manapua is frozen and chicken barely marinated. I go here just for loco moco, something you can't mess up.."}
{"text":"I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received from this company, I am currently at work I ordered lunch for myself and was told that it's going to be 30 to 45 minutes for delivery. It literally took me an hour and 45 minutes to get to my job I am extremely the satisfy with the service are receive from this company, I am currently at work I order lunch for myself and was told that it's going to be 32 45 minutes for delivery. It literally took them over an hour and 30 minutes to get Simeon, the food was cold which is completely a no no. They will not get my business going forward!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom to this place. Our first time here and my mom is new trying Hawaiian food. Awesome food, great quantity and quality. And it's open! A few other places are not open Monday's which sucks lol. I'm definitely becoming a regular :)"}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The first time I came I was with my Mom. I got the BBQ mix plate, extra Mac salad. Mom got the chicken katsu extra Mac. It was delicious, Mac salad needed salt and pepper, but good. We both agreed, much better than L&L and worthy of me bringing my Hawaiian hubby.

This time I brought my husband with me, he had the Loco Moco, and I ordered the Chicken Cutlet w/gravy. We both got regular sized plates, and even last time it was too much food, but leftovers are always nice. 

Hubby's Loco Moco had 3 real nice sized patties, perfectly cooked eggs and gravy. Hubby ate almost all of his. He said \"It isn't Rainbows kine gravy, just looks same.\" All he had left was a little Mac salad, and he said that needed salt and pepper.

I got my chicken cutlet (looked and tasted just like katsu, and not what I was expecting) because I was expecting a cutlet, mine was 'ok', but would have been better with the Katsu sauce than with the gravy. The gravy had just the right amount of seasoning for me, but I'm a salt lover so may be too salty for others.

As for the speed of service, I really wasn't in a rush and the speed was okay to me, the lady brought us out our order as we got it to-go. As far as fun/friendly atmosphere, not today, but it could have been because they were working the Labor Day holiday. ?"}
{"text":"Fantastic Hawaiian BBQ

I still don't get the whole steamed rice & macaroni salad as sides but as far as the bbq-I was pleasantly suprised.

This place has a small dining area but most orders are take-out. 
They also have the largest Hawaiian shirt on the planet hanging on the wall. REAL Cool!

Service is fast & friendly and the prices and selection is terrific!:)"}
{"text":"Not the best in Vegas but pretty good. They deliver too and that's awesome, especially if you lazy. Love their hamburger steak and musubis!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The food was very good. It is the best Hawaiian BBQ that I have had outside of hawaii. It was much better then the ones in San Diego."}
{"text":"I'm posting 3 because of what I had.  But perhaps I just have to find that item that I like to boost my rating.  I always drive by this location because its located near my work, but never bothered to stop by.  I'm a local girl myself, and for the most part everything that is served here, I can cook at home.  BUT on those occasions when I get too lazy, its nice to have options as to where to get my local fix.  

I ordered the Kim Chee Fried Rice.  It was a toss between Oxtail Soup or that.  Went with the Kim Chee Fried Rice since it was too hot for Oxtail Soup.  Huge portions.  I asked if they put meat in the rice, she said no but that I could order a combo.  I ended up ordering Teriyaki Beef with it.  Kimchee fried rice was decent, but they could make it better by chopping up the kimchee (which is jar type), put more egg, maybe already put some kind of meat in it too.  But that's my preference. 

Friendly service, I will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Let me just start off saying the food is great ! 
The area next to the fountain drinks with all the condiments is always f***ing messy and sticky af :( . 
I don't know what is about the people on register and why they always got an attitude but it's disturbing lol .
Only reason I still go is because the food is bomb I usually just call for delivery so I can avoid going inside the place"}
{"text":"Complete garbage. Got the loco moco. And a Hawaiian style mix plate with chicken katsu curry. The gravy tasted like garlic shrimp for some reason. The chicken katsu curry was like some Indian curry that makes you diarrhea after. Shiety. I dont think these fakahs ever been to hawaii..."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Oahu and I have been unable to find good local food let alone great local food. I do cook a lot of local food myself but I do get lazy myself and order delivery. I prefer the AH BBQ on Craig but now that I live near Green Valley, I order from the Pecos restaurant.

I like there serving size, there customer service is great and they are pretty good when you give them directions.

Large Plates (I don't order minis normally for the fam bam)
Kalua Pig & Cabbage - 3/5 Stars
Spam Saimin -  4/5
BBQ Mix - 3/5 
Curry - 3/5
Mac Salad - 2/5
Chicken Katsu - 3/5
Seafood Mix - 3/5
Mahi Mahi - 4/5 (I ordered a large but I still feel they were stingy on the fish, it was not too big)
Rice - 4/5
Loco Moco - 3/5 (I asked them to not make it so greasy and to put the gravy on the side and that seems to work)
Spam Musubi - 2/5 (It is just had teriyaki sauce on it and I dislike it done that way and the rice is overly sticky like it had too much water) 

I hope this helps!

Aloha, Lisa"}
{"text":"I had their Ox Tail Soup and it was good. Unfortunately, there are so many Hawaiian places in Vegas that this place just doesn't stand out for me. Hence the \"A-OK\" rating. Also, Ross J's Aloha Grill is right down the street. You might as well go to Ross J's if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to try it as it advertised that they had oxtail soup, which is one of my favorite soups of all time.  The oxtail was tasty and prepared really hot which it needs to be.  Afterward, i came back many times trying the kalbi, mahi mahi, shrimp...and pretty much everything possible.  Service may take a while as it gets busy during lunch but phone ahead if youre in a hurry.

Overall, its a great Hawaiian place to try if you're in the area but its definitely not a place id drive great lengths to eat at."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is a melting pot of food throughout the world. In this melting pot, the delicious food of Hawaii is represented in several Hawaiin BBQ restaurants from Boulder City at the southeast to the Mount Charleston turnoff in the northwest. Fortunately, the majority of the people living here live close to a Hawaiian restaurant. I am one of those people. 

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is close to my home and place of work. After a hard day's work there have been a few times that I stopped here to recuperate with the taste of a Hawaiian plate lunch.

In contrast to the mesmerizing scenery of a tranquil beach in Hawaii, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is ordinary scenery. It is a hole in the wall restaurant that blends in with a 7-Eleven and Roberto's Taco Shop at the northwest corner of Sunset and Pecos Roads. It is a hole in the wall place that falls short of the dining atmosphere in the nearby Ross J's but makes up for it in convenience and value. Where Ross J's further east on Sunset Road has often been mobbed, this Aloha Hawaiian BBQ has always been convenient. 

When I have visited this establishment in the early afternoon there has never been a line. At the same time their has always been a pleasant employee welcoming me to the restaurant. On the yellow wall to the left there has been a large menu to welcome me. It is a familiar menu that reminds me of L&L Barbecue. The dining room itself looks like both an L&L Barbecue and a Chinese take out. What differentiates the dining room from an L&L is the giant Hawaiian shirt on the wall. This is an attention grabber that has made it on several Yelp pictures of this business. 

My meal of choice has been the mini portion of the Hawaiian BBQ chicken. At $6.59 before tax it includes either white or brown rice with macaroni salad. The menu boasts that this is one of their best selling items. At this juncture I must mention that Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is one of the few Hawaiian BBQ restaurants that I am cognizant of that provides a choice of either white or white rice. With the mini plate lunch, I add a regular Coke for a $1.50 which after tax brings the total to $8.64. After paying, I will saunter a few feet from the counter to the Coca-Cola fountain to fill up my styrofoam cup with my favorite drink in the World: strawberry soda. 

The gap between ordering and seeing it has been a few minutes. The fact that they have the air conditioning running and a fan makes the wait bearable during the hot days of summer. 

The food is an example of quality equals quantity. They give you so much food for a so-called mini portion. When I look at the large pieces of the grilled boneless and skinless chicken that is marinated in their own BBQ sauce, I think out loud, \"Aloha to all this food. How much food would be in the large plate lunch?\" My tradition is to compliment the flavor by walking to the condiment station where I will pour Sriracha sauce over the chicken and soy sauce. I will save the best for last: the macaroni salad. 

The Aloha mini BBQ plate lunch with a Coke is great value served in a convenient setting. Regardless that Aloha Hawaiian BBQ falls short of the dining environments in some Hawaiian BBQ restaurants, it makes up for it with quality and quantity.

Post Review Tip: Sunrise Coffee is a short distance west on Sunset Road."}
{"text":"I wish i live close to this place!!!! =( ive been going here for like 5-6 years now. I love the bbq combo! I love the macaroni! Better than aloha kitchen! And their serving is large! Worth the price!! I used to go here like 3-4x a week when i used to live closeby. That even if i cooked something at home, id always crave for their bbq and end up buying it. But now im like 8mi away from them... Huhu. I wish they have more locations! I still go here but not as often as i used to.. Staff are friendly too!"}
{"text":"Good food but not so good service or clean inside. Ask for to go sauces if you need any. Watched the manager refill sauces in a non health code way. Not to mention all the silverware and squeeze sauces are right above the trash"}
{"text":"So i order the oxtail form aloha bbq.
Talk about no flavor at all tasted like hot water and oxtail.. the meat was a gray looking color about 3 and a have oxtail ... come on if u going charger that much and list it as a chef special at least do it right..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hawaiian place. I love the selection of food and I love the food as well. The service is always quick and friendly and the restaurant is always clean. They have a large variety of dishes that are cooked just right and at very good prices. 

My favorite dish here is the fried Scallops. It's something I don't see at a lot of Hawaiian food locations. Nice Panko breaded Scallops that are not overcooked. Writing about it makes me hungry. 

The Fried Rice is really good too. They exercise a good amount of restraint when it comes to seasoning which makes for a nice Fried Rice. I decided to grab some Shrimp Fried Rice and I got a Shrimp in every scoop of Fried Rice which makes me smile. 

The Oxtail Soup will put you to sleep faster than a Thanksgiving Turkey dinner. Salivate and snore lol. 

I like the Chicken Katsu and the BBQ chicken as well. They are not boring pieces of chicken flavored cardboard like some of the other places, these are nice and flavorful. 

Even the side dishes are good here. The Mac Salad goes good with anything. The Portion sizes for all the dishes are just right. There are regular sizes and small sizes so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Lady behind the counter was extremely rude, walked in with two friends,  the only other two people in the place besides the workers were already eating their food.  Not once did this lady smile,  she actually had a scowl on her face.  The iced tea was out and she explained she was too busy to change it out.  They only changed it out when we asked for a refund. It took over 30 minutes to receive our order and when we asked for an extra hot sauce, she bellowed NO!"}
{"text":"It was just okay. We took my mom there who wanted some Hawaiian BBQ. She ended up ordering garlic shrimp which she said was okay. The fried shrimp was really oily and the veggie egg rolls - something was a little off on the flavor. Maybe the BBQ is the way to go, but for our group it was just okay."}
{"text":"Horrible service.!!!! I will never order from this place again. I placed my order at 1:40 and I just received my simple chicken katsu order at 3:17pm. I called the restaurant to check on the order and they were surprised that the driver still didn't arrive then I spoke with someone at the restaurant again since she had to call me back and never did she had a shitty attitude."}
{"text":"Had the hawaiin bbq chicken and beef short ribs with fried mahi and shrimp. Everything was satisfactory, fried Mahi was delicious. Second time here,  Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"I've heard rumors that another Hawaii joint existed around my side of town. My friends that live close by talk about how good their chicken katsu is. After an afternoon nap, I wanted to make my way to Aloha Hawaiian BBQ so I could check this place out. Although I'm always weary about visiting a place right before they close, because of the possibility food has stayed out all day, I still decided to get there and try out their grub.

This joint is located close to the Pecos/Sunset intersection next door to the Roberto's Taco Shop. I feel like this place is owned by a former L&L's owner or part of the family. When you enter, you notice the place very similar to it. The walls are a canary yellow much like L&L's. There's booth seating and table tops with a contrasting blue, and then it hits you. The giant sized Aloha shirt. Definitely a focal point for sure. Next to the shirt is an aesthetically pleasing menu size. Gives you the break down of things they serve and sizes offered. The young female taking my order was very nice and pleasant. She was accommodating and personable. The ordering counter was kind of a cluttered mess though. Business cards from everywhere, change surrounding the lucky cat.  I didn't know where to look, where to move, just a bit much. For my meal, I started with the Hawaiian Sun passion fruit drink for around $1.45. As for the food, here's what I got:

Spam Musubi for $2.15: The spam was marinated in teriyaki sauce and fried. It was a thick piece which I appreciated but could have used a little more char on the outside.The inside, because it was so thick, was a bit mushy. The rice, was definitely something that was out most of the day. It wasn't as sticky as I hoped it to be and the nori seaweed wasn't as crunchy as I have experienced at other joints. 

Chicken Katsu curry for $7.75: Breaded white meat chicken, served with curry sauce, optional katsu sauce and macaroni salad. The breading was light and crispy and I really liked that the meat was thinly sliced as it made for a quick cooking process.  The mac salad was drenched in mayo and seemed more of a soup rather than a salad. Thank goodness I asked for the curry on the side. The curry was hot, but super chunky. That was what I was fearing. The curry tasted like it was out all day, or even scooped up from a previous curry stew. No matter how much time I microwaved it for at home, the chunky, almost starchy curry dipping sauce kept its chunky form. The taste was alright but I was too sketched out to use it. I also asked for chicken katsu sauce. It tasted like L&L's sauce. Very tangy, not like the soy sauce/ketchup based ones I prefer. Still, a flavorful combined dish.

I feel like there's two kinds of Hawaiian joints: group A joints like Island Flavor, Ross J's and Aloha Kitchen and group B joints like L&L, Ohana BBQ and this joint. It's still a good place to eat, but my heart will always belong to those places in group A. I still enjoyed my experience and will probably be back on another night to experience other dishes. My rating may change, who knows."}
{"text":"I find most Hawaiian plate places are pretty much the same, but on occasion a certain place might surprise me on the little differences that can set them apart even though they're serving the same usual menu. 

We grabbed a Combo Plate C-3 which is BBQ chicken, fried shrimp and mahi-mahi ($8.20) and a mini chicken katsu ($4.95). 

They give you the option of steamed rice or fried rice. Now normally I stir away at Chinese places that have lunch specials with fried rice since i usually gets the Panda Express treatment- just taste like soy and oil and not much else. I figured I never had fried rice at a Hawaiian place so we ordered one entree with the fried rice and one with steamed (just in case). 

BBQ chicken was nice in flavors and  give the teriyaki sauce a try with it. Normally I skip the sauce since most places it's this thick sticky cloyingly sweet salty thing. Theirs is light, kinda with a garlicky taste and you can taste some ginger in there. A little bit complimented the meat instead of overpowering.

Fried shrimp- standard, but good. Batter is light with some panko and you can see the fryer oil is clean since the batter taste how it should. 

Mahi- not in the panko batter, but this was decent. My problem is some places give a super thin piece that it's eating batter with a side of fish. Also many places it's fishy and it's something to skip. It wasn't bad here. 

Katsu was great. Light batter and panko since a lot of places overdo the batter and use it to mask the not so quality, fatty chicken. White meat, clean batter good sweet, but a bit worstershire-sque sauce. 

Fried rice was pretty good! It had a sweet shoyu taste and just simple with egg so it's not overly flavored, but just enough. It's also not greasy either. 

It's the little details that count and what makes this a better plate option over some of the competitors close by."}
{"text":"Good change from typical fast food. You can buy the the bbQ combo and it will last you through your whole work day. It did for me haha! Price decent for the quality and amount of food you get. I'm glad there's another place close to work. Alooohaaaa!"}
{"text":"Ive only tried the seafood and the beef, both are very tasty.  I love that they have kimchi!  Plus they deliver,  its a win win."}
{"text":"One of the best fried udon noodles I've ever had. I was surprised. It was cheaper and better than PF Changs"}
{"text":"The mixed plate is amazing.  You get so much food and it is so fresh.  The menu prices aren't bad, and two people can certainly share one order, for the most part.  We have also tried the spicy bbq bowl, and it's really good."}
{"text":"Bbq chicken was not bad most of the food I had was so so but they do have an considerably standard for food plus usually quick delivery but not all the time.

The hamburger was good for the price less then 3 dollars and it's pretty meaty 

The servers if you get the usual girl that's like 4 foot 8in she's nice and well waited to you most of the people is friendly I will give them 4 out of 5 if they had better food but the service was good"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Katsu Regular. Tasted just like a family member makes. The sauce tasted a little more Vinegary than im used to. But the chicken had a good amount of breading wasnt over done. For the price you get enough chicken, and Macaroni salad. I opted for the fried rice. Its enough food where i couldnt finish it all. The fried rice was moist. And the macaroni salad was good but had more of a tuna flavor then im used to. They also offer catering. On the drink menu they also have Thai Tea. The seating are is a little weird but they worked with the space they wre given."}
{"text":"Great portions at a great price with fast and friendly service! I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon to try their fare. I must say that the BBQ mix plate is enough to feed 2 or more people! The meat was all very flavorful and crisp on the outside while still juicy on the inside. The rice was cooked to perfection and the macaroni salad was a nice complement to the meat.

 I will be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"I lived in Hawaii for over 12 years, so I don't know if that makes me qualified to pass judgment on a plate lunch place, I have eaten my share of them, but this place is as good as just about any I've had. 

When you live miles away from the Ania, it's as close as you can get. My husband found this place and we've enjoyed it many times. It's about as far from our house in Vegas as you can get, but worth the drive for us, we love it. 

I usually get the combination chicken katsu curry, hamburger steak and teri beef. This combination hits the spot for me. I think the curry flavors are accurate and the texture of the katsu is crispy, so I know it's close to the Hawaii flavors I remember. 

When I am in the mood for plate lunch, I'll make this long drive!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly. Sort of clean but pretty dirty dining area. Pretty dirty bathroom too. I over look all this because when I eat in places like this in Hawaii they're usually just as unclean if not worse. 
  Food wise goes like this. Spam musubi, ramen, Rice bowls, mix plates, teriyaki etc. chicken, beef. 
Hawaiian sun product drinks and fountain sodas. Good news for people like me they have a broccoli and rice, teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite place. This is the place I come to when I don't want to drive to far to get local food. The noodles are pretty good. I got the fried Saimin char siu. Though the flavors were ok, the char siu had tons of fat on it. Not much meat at all. We also got our favorite Hawaiian sun drinks. Something happened today that is making me think that I may not come back. As we were sitting there waiting for our food I noticed something crawling on the napkin dispenser. It was a fast moving tiny roach. So our food was delivered to our table and we ate. I finished first and started this review. Right in the middle writing the review my son stuck out his tongue and said yucky. Using the fork I took the thing off his tongue and saw that it was paper. Paper? Yeah, I'm not going back there again. 2 stars for the noodles be ok if it didn't have the paper."}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian/Local Food.  The Sweet Sour Spareribs is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Very authentic tasting menu, couldn't tell if I was in Vegas or Ewa Beach!! Broke da mouth the Teri-beef, BBQ chicken was on point! Mac salad was ono too!!! Definitely be back and soon!!"}
{"text":"Honestly wish zero stars was an option. We placed our order at 2:03 PM. Delivery time provided was 3:09. At 3:20, i requested an order update.  Saidthe food was on its way.  At 3:40, I received a call from the delivery driver who was knocking on someone else's door. I asked him where he was, and he hung up. I contacted eat24, who then followed up with the restaurant, and said the driver was lost (no kidding), and didn't speak English, so we could not direct him. After multiple messages back and forth with eat24, the driver arrived at 4:15 PM. Which meant our food had been s
itting in the car for an hour or more, based on the time we were told the driver was en route. Our food was not fresh, and our drinks were warm. And, as if it couldn't get any better, my girlfriend just chipped a tooth on a PIECE OF GLASS in her boba. Awful service, awful staff, and literally dangerous food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. However the lady at the front use a few tips. I informed her that my Boba taste like crap and I would like a tai tea instead and she told me normally they will not give you a different drink if you don't like it. That's bad for business. Anyways she ended up giving me my tai tea. I wonder if something doesn't taste right to you if she'll make you something else. I don't know but she got on my nerves."}
{"text":"I've been ordering delivery from here off and on over the last 6 months. Prices are fair, food is decent. Plenty of food comes and delivery has been on time each time with no issues.

My usual order is a mixed plate, either seafood with mahi mahi and shrimp along with short ribs, or the standard mix with chicken and beef along with short ribs. Add a thai iced tea and its all good!

Sure, I like Ross J's better, but can't find a delivery service from there. This is just fine, no issues and very tasty."}
{"text":"First off the young Asian male was the worst person ever at he cash register . Had no clue about the food there was rude and when i decided  to pay he took the money from my hand like i was a crack head who owed his dealer. The hot sauce was watered down. i didn't check my order and when i got back to work it was like 5 ponds of rice with $ pieces of Katusha chicken and @ cups of sum curry gravy poured all over. I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN AND ADVISE YOU DON'T EITHER I HAVE BEEN TO  HAWAII AND THIS FOOD IS NOT EVEN CLOSE THEN THERE WAS SOME DIRTY MEXICAN MAN SCRATCHING HIS FACE AND COOKING THE FOOD.   WORST WORST WORST FOOD EVER."}
{"text":"Have been going here off and on and it really seems to be hit or miss when it comes to the food...I've ordered teri beef that must have been soaking for a week.  The taste was so strong that I could barely eat it.  The next time I went the food was pretty good.  Then I went this past Wednesday and ordered the curry katsu.  They gave me the regular sauce and the katsu had no taste \"at all\".  Guess I will travel further to get good, consistent tasting food..."}
{"text":"They are a 5 minute drive from my office and every item I've ordered has been great.

Hands down the BEST Hawaiian burger I've ever had. 
Love how quick their service is"}
{"text":"It's been about a single visit so far with this local joint and it's mostly convenient since its close to work. 
My order was the regular size Chicken Katsu meal with steamed rice, added on a side of chicken BBQ musubi and manapuas to share with coworkers. 

I'd like to say the katsu was alright. Nothing special, simple breading (I daresay it is nothing close to PANKO brand breading type, maybe just cheap breading) of chicken along with the sauce. The sauce tasted like it came from a cheap bottle brand. 

Portion of the katsu and rice was generous and a scoop of the typical Mac salad. Very similar to Americanized Hawaiian franchise of L&L. The Manapua (meat bun) was OK. It was small and a bit stale due to the bread. The musubi was probably the only thing I enjoyed. Lol 

Its Hawaiian alright but to truly taste the distinct flavors of a traditional hawaiian cuisine and you want to satiate those taste buds, I'd look elsewhere; otherwise try this joint if you're craving for 'different food' other than the regular burger and fries theme and/or for a quick eat. I give it a 3-star only because of the courteous service and speedy wait time to receive the food, plus they got this giant Aloha shirt on their restaurant wall which was kinda cool. Overall, it did not please my taste buds that day."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Always clean! This is my favorite location in Vegas. They offer garlic shrimp which are breaded and fried not like the other locations. Good portions for the prices. They also have poke and you can tell it's fresh by the color of it. Every time I go I have to get an order of it but I would like it if they gave a little more"}
{"text":"i order this place 3~4 times a week
hopfully they continue ti improve and not firget stuff
taste quality is amazing for priceo"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Way way way better than L&L's Hawaiian Kill. Aloha Kitchen is amazing when it comes to quality. Don't mind the dirty restrooms lol but it reminds me of an old ma and pa or hole in the wall type of eatery! Please don't hesitate and just visit these guys for some good quick Hawaiian grill!!"}
{"text":"This review will probably need to be updated later on once I try out more food selections. 

Since this was on the way home from work, I decided to grab lunch which consisted of a mini Chicken Katsu.. I only ate the Chicken and the sauce to dip it in is delicious! it reminds me of a mix of A1 sauce and vinegar or something, can't quite put my tongue on it... 

I will re-evaluate once I try the spam musubi :D"}
{"text":"It's not ross Js or anything but better than most L&L.  I have been coming here for probably a little over four years and the food is right and always consistent.  Open  around lunch time and open until 9:30pm.  Tire Works and a Sinclair gas station are good landmarks to find Aloha Hawaiian Bbq."}
{"text":"I eat here often, they give large portions of decent food. I pay 10.00 and receive 2scoops of rice a good portion of macaroni salad and more chicken Katsu than I can eat in one sitting. (as a hungry man) their drink selection is poor with only having a few soda options, nasty tea and lemonade. Although they do have a Thai tea that is pretty good you'll pay a price for it. 
Overall it's worth the go, it's just not GREAT food."}
{"text":"Love the people and fast work their food is always and HUGE PORTIONS  good and very delicious I always get the chicken katsu and Bbq beef!!!!"}
