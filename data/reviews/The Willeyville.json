{"text":"We are so glad this area of town is getting some great places to eat.  We went here on a weekday for lunch.  The calamari was to die for!  Crispy, hot , with a sweet Thai sauce - light on ginger!  We then had the chop salad - great dressing and crisp greens and the Bibb salad - so good!  Great fresh hot bread with herbed butter!   Love the fact that they try to use local foods!  Nice to be able to watch the kitchen in action!  Good beer selection!  Beautiful decor!  The service was prompt without being intrusive!  We will return for dinner or drinks!  Nice addition to the Cleveland food scene!"}
{"text":"We had drinks, dinner, and dessert and it was excellent. We ordered the cheese plate for an appetizer which was good not great. Main courses ordered were the mahi mahi, duck, gnocchi, and the gnudi. All were delicious. Above all else, the service was outstanding. We never had a water glass even half full and when someone went to the restroom the waiter took their dish and put it under the heater to keep it warm. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate when one has to write such a review. I post when the experience either is either remarkable or absolutely unacceptable.  This review addresses the latter.   I'm with a small group of folks who have spent the last week dining our way through the City. As foodies we have tried new places for nearly every meal and have found Cleveland cuisine to be pleasantly enjoyable.   When someone suggested this restaurant we were really excited as the menu looked unique and fun. In reality, the most interesting thing about Willeyville is their online menu. Once seated, the experience wanes which is probably why on a Friday night at 7:45 PM the establishment was 60% empty.   From the time we began ordering it was a race to the bottom.  The following recollections were assembled for this review. - Two of our 4 drinks in the first round were made incorrectly. When I walked to the bar (because it took 15 minutes to get drinks in an empty restaurant) the bartender waved me off and said a new drink would be delivered. That took 10 more minutes. In the meantime the server came over and said she thinks she had swapped mine for the other mis-made cocktail at the table. She proceeded to pick it up and sniff it and then ask if the other person had drank it to then offer it to me. It was still the wrong drink. When the Knob Creek Manhattan arrived (finally) it was an awful blend of excessive vermouth and of course whiskey.  - Further on the cocktail front we ordered another round later in the evening (of course I requested lighter vermouth) and my drink came in 10 minutes while the other two ordered at the same time took nearly 20 minutes. By this point the establishment was nearly empty. Why it took so long is befuddling. And it was clear how much vermouth they were using as the drink was now a full finger lower in the glass.  -  - On the food front it's hard to know where to start and end.  o The appetizers ordered all came except for the one I had ordered. Due to food allergies, it was the only one I could eat so I asked 3 times over the next half hour when it was coming out. The irony is that it was \"tater tots\" which should have been among the easiest of the items to produce. There was never an apology and each reminder received an \"oh\" response.  o The tater tots themselves by no means were tater tots. Any other establishment would have called properly called them potato croquettes. They were uninspiring either way.  o The \"smoked chicken wings\" were neither smoked nor chicken like. They appeared to be the equivalent of wings from a generic wing bag you'd find in your freezer at the local supermarket. They lathered these half dollar sized wings with some awful tasteless sauce that was neither spicy, garlicy nor hot as the menu stated.  o The queso dip that came out appeared to be more like a cheese soup that was half water. The chips that came with it were some poorly fried pita like chip rather than fresh corn chips which would have been the rational service option.  o The Pad Thai noodles looked and tasted something akin to rehydrated noodles served on the International Space Station.  o The hamburger was prepared medium and was so dry you could barely cut through it or chew it. When the burger came, I asked why the prep was different that what was on the menu. The server proceed to explain that the menu isn't accurate. I'm sorry, WHAT?   I could go on, but I think this is a comprehensive enough of an explanation of how they fail on every front - Food, Service and Beverage. In sum, the food had no flavor, the service was slow and rude and the server didn't know her own menu when asked simple questions.   For a much better experience try The Butcher and The Brewer on 4th Street. Their smoked chicken wings and tapas style plates were literally filled with complex flavors and prepared expertly. We ate there the night before and regretted we didn't return."}
{"text":"First off, any place with decent poutine scores in my book.  The poutine here rocks - the hot sauce and the cracklin's put it into the awesome category.  I had a smoked trout special - awesome.  My wife had salmon fish tacos.  Good but not great.  Missed the crispness of a SoCal fish taco.  The kale pesto with the bread was also a nice spin on traditional pesto.  Everything tasted fresh.  Very good service."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday night in January and the place was packed. I took that as a good sign however I was a little disappointed.  The service wasn't great, it took a while for the waiter to take each set of orders (drink, appetizers, and main course) and it took at least 15 minutes for our drinks to come. One person I was with ordered a second drink and it just never came. Each of the people I was with got a different main dish and no one was very impressed. That being said, the whipped ricotta was fantastic and is easily among the top appetizers I've had. It may be the only reason I give this place another chance but there are plenty of places I want to check out first."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have ordered the ricotta dip on both occasions (and I urge you to do the same!). It's creamy with a little bit of heat from red pepper flakes. I've tried to re-create it at home, but I just can't seem to get it right. I've also had the ramen with chicken and a poached egg - also phenomenal.   On both trips, I've had the same friendly and accommodating server. Our service was great even when we had a party of 10.   A bit pricey, but I would say it's worth it. The ambiance is great, too!"}
{"text":"Great food, very interesting menu as we as everything apparently is made in house. Great for vegans.  A but on be pricey side but certainly well worth it! A Must go to in downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see places coming back to The Flats, but honestly I was underwhelmed with the restaurant. The food was just okay, some seemed a little confused at times with TOO many flavors working against each other. The wait staff were not friendly and were not interested in answering any questions about the menu- quite honestly they seemed annoyed. I would be willing to give it another chance though."}
{"text":"Wow! Love the wings. Crispy and fantastic smoke flavor. Definitely try them. They're a must!"}
{"text":"The weirdest combinations of ingredients ever, not all edible.  A lot of the food was too salty."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Service and food has been phenomenal every time I have been, and the atmosphere is great. Recommend for both date nights and family dinners."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Had the lettuce wraps with delicious pork. The menu looks a little unique but when you taste the creations from the chef, you will be so happy you came. Sat at the bar, very pleasant made outstanding cocktails, and truly enjoyed my meal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food, did ramen, salmon tacos, Brussels sprouts, did not like any of the items- never been this disappointed with a restaurant in downtown."}
{"text":"One of the best Bloody Mary's that I've ever had.  Food was great.  Easy parking to and from the Browns game.  Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"The pork shank entree was fantastic. The meat just fell off the bone. The gnocchi was also very good but the portion size was disappointing. The atmosphere was very quaint and enjoyable. The hummus appetizer was good but the potato chips were extremely salty. The pita chips were perfect with good texture. I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly! We spoke with Chris, the chef, and he said most of the menu can be made gluten free - so ask! The calamari was made gluten free with rice flour and tasted fantastic. I had the tagliatelle with meatballs; not gluten free, but the meatballs are absolutely amazing!!  This is my new favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I know this place just opened, so they may improve in the next 6-9 months. The food was cold and not that good. The food was presented like an \"at-home practicing type presentation.\" They had too many servers standing around in corners just waiting, Im not sure for what. The servers were not aware, at all. I think since we went so early in the evening they hadn't warmed up yet. Honestly, I would have preffered to eat in the Warehouse district than at this place or try the Italian restaurant in the hotel next door. The fire alarm was going off during half of our visit. The manager did not come up to the tables & apologize for the annoying noise during the first half of our visit. The hostess did advise us that there was not a fire. In addition, she sure did bark orders at one of the servers in front of us. As I made my way to the one stall restroom, I saw an employee eating food with his bare hands out of a bowl in the kitchen, where they were preparing food for customers. You can park on the street, paid parking lot or garages."}
{"text":"One of the many reasons we love Cleveland is the selection of interesting restaurants in cool spaces. Willeyville was not one of them. Located on the East Bank of the flats, the location is really cool but the new building (A-Loft Hotel) is without history, personality or creative design. The food and service were very good but the menu was a little too heavy for our liking. Overall, there was nothing memorable about the atmosphere, menu or service. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is on a street corner -- breezy and a great way to enjoy a summer's evening. However it posed a challenge for the kitchen. If our food was hot when it left the kitchen, it wasn't by the time it made it to table. They need to heat the plates more.  The poutine appetizer lacked gravy but was ok. If it had been more than lukewarm it would have been better. The gnudi featured the tenderest, delicious pasta with slices of brussels sprouts and oodles of creamy cheese sauce. Decadent. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Best Yelp event we've been to! The waitstaff were SUPER attentive, the restaurant itself was lovely and the drinks...oh, my, the mixed drinks. The MUST HAVE beverage of the evening was the Moscow Mull served in a copper mug. Get one."}
{"text":"Hip atmosphere, good food if a bit pricey.  Stopped in for a quick bite with the family on our way to a recent Cavs game.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered...I can only comment on my dishes as I did not sample anyone else's meal.  The wedge salad had locally sourced bacon and homemade ranch dressing and was made up of half a head of lettuce (no lie!).  The Minestrone soup was chock full of vegetables and the artisan bread (served to the table) was great for dunking and soaking up the broth.  Poutine was rich and tasty, including chunks of bacon...not exactly traditional but the overall presentation and flavors were spot on.  Great addition to the growing food scene down in the rejuvenated flats!"}
{"text":"Crazy good stuff - everything made from scratch...i mean everything.(ketchup - really? yes - even ketchup.)  Got to try the Duck MacMuffin - with house made English muffins cooked in duck fat - amazing topped with a house made duck sausage patty with some sweet maple syrup, fresh arugula and an over easy egg.  Surprised by the Ricotta sampler - never been a fan - but the variety had so much flavor(smoked paprika, merlot soaked and whipped with EVOO).   Hope this place does awesome !  Great cocktails too - homemade ginger beer, vermouths, etc...very knowledgeable (and personable) staff.  Cool specialty beer list and cocktail/wine list."}
{"text":"Damn, I had high hopes for this place.  Here is how it fell apart for me on Saturday August 17, 2013.    1.  Major disconnect between how the food is described on the menu and what is actually served.  For example, we ordered the \"popcorn.\"   On the menu it is described as \"curried popcorn/ peanuts / coconut / chili // \". Lo and behold what comes out of the kitchen is more of a chewy peanut brittle like Crunch n Munch.  When you advertise popcorn, I expect popcorn (see: Crop, they get it right).  This brittle was way, way too sweet to be served as an appetizer.  It paralyzed my palate.  Very Mild hints of curry.  Whoever wrote the description needs to rework that.  And either dial up the savory hints...or put it on the dessert menu.  2.  Food was not cooked properly.  I ordered the hanger steak which the server assured me I would not need a knife to cut.  I asked for it to be prepared medium.  No kidding, it came out completely raw (now I know why I wouldn't need a knife to cut it).  Back to the kitchen it went.  In the meantime, a server brought me a serving of sorbet to cleanse my palate (nice touch...but again, it was something sweet before my entree) and it didn't really taste like anything.  Hmph.  My hanger steak arrives and it is barely cooked more than it was last time.    3.  The cucumber salad with the hanger steak was very salty and too cold.  Again, the concept of the dish was good but the execution failed, especially against raw meat.  4.  Desserts are a HUGE miss.  See #1 above.  The chocolate \"sugar\" cookie was neither chocolate nor sugar.  It tasted like a bitter, unsweetened cocoa cookie.  And raspberry ice cream?  Raspberry according to whose palate?  The blueberry sorbet was closer to its description but still not quite right.  5.  We never received bread.  Our server came back and asked us if we wanted more bread.  We said, \"Uh, we never received my bread to start with.\"  Zoinks.  And it is allegedly served with \"melon\" butter.  Again, the taste delivery was off. Bread is very good...rustic and delicious.  6.  Service was slow.  Come on.  The place wasn't packed AND it is not that big of a restaurant.  7.  Saving grace of the night?  The cocktails!  The Shady Lane and the Smash made with Maker's Mark were both killer good drinks.  Bravo on that.   I really, really wanted to dig this place.  I love that everything is house-made.  But there appears to be disconnects and missed executions on the food, not to mention confusion as to what the restaurant concept really is.  Blasting the Black Keys and Rolling Stones at high volume made it difficult to have conversation.  Sorry, Willeyville, but you have some kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Service was pretty uneven. Our waitress seemed to never get our drink order right for our party of 8. She seemed overwhelmed, they could of had someone helping her rather than all standing around at the bar. The food was pretty good, nothing super special. The building is pretty cool, I like how it is decorated. Would go back for drinks."}
{"text":"Very cool place! I was visiting from out of town and went with my boyfriend and his dad. I am super allergic to gluten and the chef came over and pointed out everything that I could eat ( almost the entire menu btw). I had fresh veggies with pesto while the bf had bread and we ordered the calamari gluten free as an app. It's been years since I've had fried calamari and it was amazing! They used an almond flour (it may have been rice flour  :) ) covering to make it breaded. I had the 1/2 chicken and it was quite tasty. My bf had the  homemade pasta and meatballs and he wouldn't stop talking about how good it was! Overall I highly recommend! Incredibly gluten free friendly with tasty food and a fun atmosphere. I will be back if in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Everything is super fresh, the atmosphere is a casual chic, and the staff who work here are friendly and attentive.  This restaurant is a more pricey night out, but it is well worth it. Also, they have a fantastic happy hour menu that helps you stay  within a decent budget.   We ordered Chicken Pate as an appetizer, and it was a wonderful portion. Fed the table of 4 nicely and no one had to fight over the last bite- everyone was satisfied.  The portion filled a small mason jar and it came with crostini.   As meals we had the Salmon (if you love fish- get this. Amazingly fresh), beef brisket, meatloaf,  and the pork belly ramen. Everyone at the table sampled every dish and everyone loved everything.    Drinks were also superb, decently priced, and high quality."}
{"text":"I both live and work in the Flats, so I have quickly become familiar with the restaurants here.  Overall, my experiences at Willeyville have been good; I've been for both lunch and dinner.  If you haven't been yet, I recommend checking it out.  Off the bat, this place gets high ratings from be because it is vegetarian friendly.  As a pescatarian (I eat seafood), I am disappointed in the lack of non-meat options many places in Cleveland have to offer (I'm looking at you, Flipside).  I've had the veggie ramen with a poached egg and now the veggie burger on their lunch menu.  Both were good and I would order both again.  I will warn that the veggie burger was a bit mushy, as many veggie burgers can be, so it was messy to eat because it fell apart.  Also, while the price of the veggie burger was totally reasonable ($8), paying an extra $3.50 for a side of fries annoyed me.  $11.50 itself isn't that unreasonable.  Maybe just out of principle I'd rather order a burger/sandwich and get a choice of sides included in the price than ordering this way."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a couple of drinks.  There was only 4 other people at the bar and two small tables.  The bartender dropped off our waters and then went MIA for 15 minutes (- no where to be seen).  We almost walked out. Finally we got our drinks ordered. I ordered a Moscow Mule, which was decent.   It was made with  their  own home made ginger beer and oh boy was It gingery! My wife asked for an Amstel Light and the bartender didn't know what that was.  We thought he was joking, but he wasn't.  We know its high end bar and most likely only carry micro brews, but come on man.  The food did look good, from what we saw.  We'll go back to try the food and next time we won't order anything fancy like an Amstel light."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Seems to have a nice selection of food options...something for everyone. I had the meatloaf. It had too much cheese on the potato for my liking but the meatloaf was great."}
{"text":"Very unique menu. They emphasized that everything was homemade, from the cheese to the pasta, to the drinks. I ordered something on the safer side - rigatoni with meat sauce and was amazed at how awesome it was! It just had a lot of flavor and was really simple. I couldn't get enough! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Recent dinner here before heading out for some fun in downtown Cleveland.  The service was good - the server did mention she was new, but she was fairly attentive and took care of us.  I think she could have done better with drink service as our drinks came out one by one and she wasn't exactly sure which drink belonged to each person.  And she spilled a little bit of just about everything she handed to us.    The food was average at best.  We started with a few appetizers and enjoyed the meat platter, which had a good selection.  We also tried the calamari and pickled fried veggies.  The calamari had a good flavor, but the portion size was extremely small.  I think we each (6 of us) had one or two pieces of calamari.  The veggies were super salty.  The dinners were an assortment across the menu and I don't believe anyone in the group was impressed with the food.  One ordered hummus which was bland.  I and another ordered the burger, which was also very bland.  Fish tacos were left 1/2 uneaten.  Overall I would have expected better food.  Nothing was horrible - it just wasn't good and certainly wasn't great.    The drinks were the biggest disappointment.  As mentioned before - the drinks came out randomly and we had a hard time telling what each drink was.  I ordered a sazerac and mistakenly gave it to someone else thinking it was the Birthplace of Aviation (gin, lemon, grenadine, bitters). I got the sazerac back after she brought out the real Birthplace, which didn't look anything like we guessed and was not very good.  Another person ordered the Tinker Tonic (gin/tonic, cucumber, basil) which tasted only like lemon juice and was so bitter she sent it back.  The others in the group fortunately stuck to beers and bourbon on rocks.  The cocktail drinkers ordered beers for the second serving."}
{"text":"I dined here two nights in a row - there was definitely a reason for my going back the second night! The service was impeccable, the ambience was fantastic (the space, the music, the atmosphere, etc.), the food was insanely good, and the cocktails were out of this world. I have eaten in a lot of restaurants in a lot of different cities and this easily stacks up with the best of them when you take everything into consideration (including price). If I am ever in Cleveland again this is where I'm headed...no question"}
{"text":"The place so cute!! We had a lovely time. The food was really good. If you are vegetarian it's awesome they a very good veggies burger. My friend enjoyed her sandwich!! The server was very nice!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3. Very close to a 4, Wileyville was warm and inviting on the corner of Flats East Bank project.  Nice views of construction...  Open view kitchen, which I'm always a fan.  Cost: 3. Yelp has Wiley as $$, but that's a stretch at least for dinner - most drinks are ~$10, and all entrees $20+. Layer on any other snacks are you're firmly at $30-50 a head. Admittedly, lunch looks more reasonable.  Food Quality: 4. Great appetizers - try the smoked chicken wings (best I've had in Cleveland outside of Greenhouse Tavern) or phat popcorn.  Poutine also looked very good.  Appetizers stole the show, although dessert was good (PBJ jellies). Both Hanger and Flank steaks were ok as dinners but fairly unmemorable.   Service: 3. Service was very helpful but restaurant was essentially dead on a Friday and our meal tended to drag on. At times it was \"feast or famine\" early on if waiter was around or not - make a decision.  When to return: Happy hour / for a snack. For handcrafted drinks. To spend far less money than you would at Ken Stewart's next door."}
{"text":"As I am quickly falling in love with the new-look East Bank of the Flats, we went to The Willeyville on a cool Saturday night with the sun just dipping under the horizon.  We were able to get a patio seat and enjoy the buzz of cars driving by a full parking lot and a steady stream of people smiling and laughing as they walked up and down the hill from the Warehouse District.  For an appetizer, we had the whipped ricotta ($10). And as would become a theme in our meal, it was a much more sophisticated dish than at first glance on the menu. The grilled bread was full of olive oil yet still crispy and the fluffy cheese was sprinkled with chili flakes and herbs to give it some depth.  For the main course, I had the Texas-style brisket ($22) as I was in the mood for some red meat even though the other components of the dish didn't wow me. So I was pleasantly surprised when the tangy  BBQ sauce livened up my mouth while the baked beans and corn bread provided a nice starch and then the vinegary \"mess of greens\" cut through all of that. The dish sounded very rustic but when eating it was clear that a culinary mind refined it.  Jeannnene had the \"there's a fungus among us hanger steak\" ($28.5) and she was similiarly impressed. I can only do mushrooms in small doses so I just took her word for it.  The cocktails ($11 each) were also full of intricate flavors. I had the Derby Smash (bourbon, mint,  Apricot jam and orange bitters) which wa surpisingly tart; and the Fresno Trail (bourbon chili honey and lemon juice) and yes it was both sweet and spicey at the same time.   We wanted to enjoy the food and ambiance some more but since the server didn't mention dessert we figured we'd just head out. But we will be back soon -- to both the Willeyville and the Flats in general."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. The menu attempts to be \"eclectic,\" but verges into unappetizing most of the time. I ordered the ramen, which was good, not great. And my dining partner ordered the fried veggie appetizer that had an odd taste in the breading. In general, the menu seemed overpriced ($7 for a basic salad that consisted of lettuce and carrots). Service was solid, but slow. Overall just a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I'm horribly jet lagged and still trying to adjust after flying in super late last night at 11 PM.  Feeling pretty out of it and not really wanting to walk too far from my hotel at the Aloft, I saw this place on Yelp on the same block and headed on down.  Being Monday night after 4th of July, it was very, very quiet inside - which I was extremely grateful for.  The modern decor is highlighted with vibrant colors and some quirky touches (like the Edison bulb light fixtures).  Services was amazingly quick, friendly and attentive.  Feeling like something light and healthy, I ordered the sugar snap peas salad (on the recommendation of my waiter) and the smoked pork belly ramen (with the sambal on the side because I am a wimp who can't handle spicy foods).  Both were delicious and obviously made fresh in house (they are not kidding when they say they are seriously farm to table).  Can definitely foresee myself visiting again to try some of the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good place for drinks, not food. Corn dog sounded so good when I was viewing the menu. Unfortunately, fell way short expectations. Took one bite and that was it.  The batter was fine, the weiner was awful."}
{"text":"While the service was ok and no one in our party of 6 had any complaints, the food is not that great at all and it's highly overpriced. We visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening late summer and expected it to be pretty packed so we made a reservation. It was not necessary as the place was pretty empty. I took my time to review the restaurant but I don't see any raving reviews since our visit. I won't be back here until I see better visitors' feedback. At this time there are other better places to try."}
{"text":"Go here. Seriously, this place should always be packed. The gracious and flexible hosts, to the wonderful cocktails, to the amazing service and last but not least the awesome food. I had the pork belly ramen which was very flavorful and just what one should have on a chilly cleveland night. We even stayed at the restaurant late, and Never once felt pressured to leave."}
{"text":"Handcrafted drinks--Moscow Mule was very good.  The calamari was fresh and tasty.  Between the three of us we ordered the Gnudi, Gnocchi (not your typical gnocchi), and Carbonara.  The Gnudi and Carbonara were both excellent dishes with good flavors, portions.  The Gnocchi's portion was light but tasted good.  They have a unique and tasty version of a wedge salad and make their own ice cream! Yum. Service staff was great and attentive. Prices reasonable.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We just got a salad and pickles; drinks of course. Everything was great and the rest of the menu looked delicious! Attentive bar staff and beautiful decor"}
{"text":"Amazing poutine. Pad Thai was very good as well, although you should ask them to chop up the chicken into smaller pieces. It comes out in large strips. Good drinks, too."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and I must say I was underwhelmed. The decor of the restaurant is very pretty, and we were promptly seated, but once we started getting our food, it was all downhill. We ordered the poutine to start. The fries were kind of soggy like they'd been sitting for a little while, and the toppings weren't really too special. For my entree, I ordered he chicken stuffed with sausage. The chicken and sausage themselves lacked a lot of flavor, and the whole plate was covered in sweetness! The spinach that came with the dish was basically half spinach half raisins, and the entire plate was smothered with a fig jam- it was just too much sweetness which I felt was only there to make up for the bland chicken. Two other people in our group got the ramen, and neither of them seemed too impressed. Another in our group ordered a burger- he ordered it medium well, more on the well done side, and it was definitely more like medium rare, more on the rare side. Also, the burger was smothered in cheese. While he does enjoy cheese on a burger, it was so much cheese that he was literally scraping cheese off the side of the burger. Furthermore, half way through the meal, he had run out of water, and nobody came to refill his glass during the entire meal- that's kind of service 101. Overall, I was very disappointed by this restaurant, especially given its good rating on Yelp."}
{"text":"Overall this was pretty good.  I went for Happy Hour.   The HH menu is limited and the wine list is $2 off.  I went on a Friday afternoon, right after work, there were a few other patrons seated in the bar area.   Madeline, the bartender, was attentive without being overbearing. I proceeded in ordering a glass of wine, an order of fries and the bratwurst sandwich.   The sandwich and fries arrived shortly thereafter.   The fries were good, crispy and seasoned on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.   They were served with a side of housemade ketchup and malt vinegar.   The sandwich was a little bit small.   The bratwurst link was tasty by itself, but the massive bun and sauerkraut/slaw completely masked the bratwurst.  Each component by itself was tasty but just couldn't really taste the meat.   The selling point for Willeyville is the housemade concept related to condiments, drink mix-ins etc I would return, just wouldn't be my go-to for Happy Hour....maybe dinner. ."}
{"text":"So very good, I love the homemade charcuterie plate, though american cheese jerky is an odd one.  Great drinks and a big focus on local food and drink.  Unfortunately the surrounding neighborhood was leveled for a project that never took off, but I still like sitting on the patio in the post-apocalyptic landscape."}
{"text":"This is a saturday night dinner review.  3 of us for dinner. Started out with dark and stormy which was pretty good and the big ben...was ok.  appetizers...popcorn..whatever they sprinkled on this was super spicy and irritating, all of us were coughing. also the poutin...was fine, hard to mess up bacon and french fries, house made ricotta and toast...again, was ok, nothing new.  dinner...salmon....average. i had the asian short rib...didnt taste marinated, was chewy, and cold. came with rice which wasnt seasoned at all. wife had gnocchi which werent gnocchi...just two triangles of dough that tasted like nothing.  This place was good for drinks but the food was below average."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe here. It's a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be, but lots of character :) The food was phenomenal! I had the ramen bowl with hoisin tofu and it's hands down, the best tofu I've had to date. Everything is homemade...which the staff will be sure to plug a few times, and that's ok, it's a nice reminder. It's in an up and coming part of the flats...and if it wasn't for the Ernst and Young crowd, chances are they wouldn't have stayed in business this long. Come on people....let's hit up the flats for a night out...or even just a lunch ;)"}
{"text":"The Willeyville is excellent. A small group of us went during Restaurant Week and ordered both from the special and regular menus. Everything we tried was delicious, particularly the poutine, mac & cheese, and what we deemed were quite possibly the best chicken wings we'd ever had. The service was also super -- attentive but not overwhelming -- and the view of the kitchen was very fun. More people need to go to this place! It truly is wonderful."}
{"text":"Cute, convenient location on the East side of the renewed Flats!  We went on a Mon night, so dead and empty but weekends are hustle and bustle!   The Sauerkraut Balls are really nice. Crispy outside and Hot, savory inside...served with an egg ranch and a mustard dipping sauce.   We each enjoyed good portions of the off-menu Cheddar and American Mac n Cheese, Blended Burger Project  and Queso Fundido! !! No calories counted."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here for dinner in a while, it's time you stopped back in.  This place is impressive.  And if something isn't to your liking, tell your server.  This place will bend over backwards to make things perfect.   So, now onto the review (it's long but I got a lot to rave about today)...  I've held off on reviewing this place for a year because I'm friends with everyone there. I didn't want that to impact my ability to be as honest as possible.  After a full year of eating and drinking here more times than I can count, I feel very comfortable calling this one of my top spots in Cleveland.  I think it's had a few hiccups here and there, but I'm 100% confident that this is a consistent 5-star spot.  It's been that way for a while.  The service is always top notch -- it's exceptional.  The staff is very well versed in the food, preparations, ingredients, and plating.  They know exactly what's going on in the kitchen.  This is incredibly important given the food and the ingredients are made in-house.  This also comes in handy if you walk in with a child or a crazy dietary restrictions.  No kids menu?  Trust me, they can take care of your child's whim.  Or perhaps your vegan or paleo and you don't see a damn thing on the menu that works fully to your needs.  No problem.  Find what you want on the menu and they will make it work.  I've never seen waitstaff and kitchen staff go to such lengths to ensure everyone is happy and full.  But it all starts with that friendly and knowledgeable service.  The bar is damn good too.  Cocktail wise, they make really great craft cocktails at a reasonable price given the quality of ingredients and the attention placed on doing it right. I don't see how $11 or $12 bucks for a craft cocktail is even a bit pricey given the recipes.  You're not getting anything close to well drinks. But, if you want cheap, they do have well drinks available.  All you need to do is ask. I will say they bar had some problems in the first six months of operations, but that's just not an issue anymore.  Service and quality of product are great at the bar.  What about the food?  The food is the star.  It doesn't get any better--it's creative and delicious. How do they make it so damn good?  They not only make the food from scratch, they make the ingredients from scratch.  They grind their own flour, grow their own yeast, ferment their vinegar... they even make their own tofu and miso!  They do the same thing for the bar ingredients too!  A lot of places around Cleveland play the \"farm to table\" card, but when a restaurant goes to the trouble of actually crafting the raw ingredients, they are doing it right.  Of course, someone could go through all the trouble and still make junk food.  Not here; not at The Willeyville.  This place makes damn good food.  The charcuterie is my favorite.  In the past year they have come a long way and I find this to be some of the best charcuterie in the city.  I also love the hanger steak.  Hanger steaks are a dime a dozen in Cleveland, but the way The Willeyville uses a quick cure and sous vide creates the most flavorful and tender hanger in town.  The current adobo hanger prep with hominy, pickled jalapenos, tres pepper sauces, fried shishito peppers, crispy tortillas strips is the best version of their hanger to date.  I could honestly talk about this menu for hours.  You may see a smattering of Asian, Italian, and European dishes.  While that might seem confused, remember that the focus is about true from-scratch cooking.  America is diverse, shoot Cleveland is diverse.  These are all the kinds of foods Clevelanders love, just under one roof and done really freaking well.  Personally, the ricotta gnudi is better than some of the stuff I've had at famous Italian restaurants in very big cities.  The smoked pork belly ramen (yes they even make the noodles in house) is the best bowl of ramen I've had from a restaurant not run by Japanese people. And the \"proper poutine\" while not the traditional poutine I get in Montreal, I just can't hate on it -- the thing makes my mouth and my belly beyond happy.  Don't like fancy things, then get one of the hot dogs or sausages known as  \"Willey Wieners\" during lunch or happy hour at the bar.  They grind, season, and stuff these things all in house to great success.  The Korean and the German variants are my favorite, but they got the traditional Polish boy that does the trick too.  The burgers (traditional and veggie) don't disappoint either.  I'm not a vegetarian, but that veggie burger is something I would eat regardless.   I don't have a huge sweet tooth these days, but I make sure to get desert every time I stop in.   This place does the trick for me, time and time again.  At this point in time, I can't say a bad thing about the joint.  Stop in for dinner and discover one of the best restaurants in town.   If you aren't like me and you do find something not to your liking, trust me, they will take care of you."}
{"text":"Must start with the fries (listed on menu as proper poutine)- they were amazing- spicy and flavorful with all sorts of textures! You should have seen the look I gave to one of the staffers that tried to take that plate away when there were still 5 fries on it.  I mean- really?!  The pork and duck tacos were perfect too.  Great flavor and the tortillas were a cross between naan and matzah- so yummy!  My husband wasn't thrilled with his ciopinno, but he did just get back from san fran and just no comparison.  The cheeses on the cheese plate were all very mild, would be nice to have one stronger type.   The whoopie pie was like, whatever.  The apple crisp brought it!  Oh- and so right after we paid we saw the waitress come out with cotton candy for another table and we were all, \"why you no tell US about cotton candy?\" and she said the people were friends with the owner.  But then what did she do next?! Brought some out for us!  Plus- she was awesome from the start.  Oh- and great music/playlist.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"I was on the fence about whether or not to actually take the time to update my review of The Willeyville. After all, we had only been there once before well over a year ago. Unfortunately, the disappointment we experienced during our last visit warranted at least a brief write-up.  I still stand by my previous review when it comes to most of the aspects of service and location. Neither of those experiences have changed in any noticeable fashion, although the service was quite, how to put it nicely, stretched out. We were essentially the only couple in the restaurant and it took about 20 minutes for us to receive our appetizer. Where they really fell short this time was with the food.  When you visit a restaurant knowing full well that you'll be spending somewhere around $100 for dinner and drinks, you've got certain expectations for nearly everything. This is especially the case when it comes to the food.   Our first course started out great. We ordered the Hot Arse Spinach Dip ($11.50). A bowl of blazing hot (temperature, not spice heat) cheesy goodness surrounded by crispy, fried tortilla chips. It was sinfully good.  Little did we know things were about to veer terribly off course.  The Willey Caeser Salad ($9.50) that my wife ordered was not what we expected at all. First, it's loaded with sliced jalapeno peppers. If you are even remotely sensitive to heat in your food, steer clear of this salad. Second, the fried egg served atop the salad doesn't really work, Once you break the yolk it essentially turns the salad into a soppy, yolky mess and the type of bowl it's served in makes it awkward to eat.  The disappointment continues...  The Local Grass-Fed Beef Cheek Mac and Cheese ($18.50) was just not good. Not good at all. Oh, and you read that price right. For nearly $20 I received a small bowl of pasta tossed with asparagus. Creamy it was not. The beef cheek was basically four small chewy, fatty pieces of meat buried under the pasta. I felt like this was a dish that I could have made at home. Sounded so good on paper.  The biggest disappointment of the evening was the Grilled Salmon Fish Tacos ($19.50). Wow. My wife and I couldn't even believe how bad this dish was. The flour tortillas tasted raw. The slaw made them wet and the portion size of the actual fish - what I can only assume is the reason for the insane pricetag - was ridiculously small. Three tiny pieces, barely enough for an appetizer. My wife ate the fish and left everything else on the plate, untouched.  Those of you that read my reviews know that I am not normally one to complain about price. I know before I visit a restaurant how much I'll probably be spending and I also believe that you really do get what you pay for...most of the time. This visit to Willeyville was just such a stark contrast to our first visit that it didn't even seem like the same place. I'm sorry to say that I just don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! After a weeklong stay in Cleveland and looking for  healthy organic restaurants who care about what they serve....the best one I ate at was right next to my hotel. Willeyville is one I will  return to again and again. The variety is fantastic and my salmon tacos were the perfect dinner accompanied by a kale and beet salad. The staff was very accommodating even though the kitchen was closing in a few minutes. Simply put...they know and care about where their food is coming from and its is all presented in a very creative and flavorful way. A hidden gem located on the edge of downtown Cleveland. Willeyville is a must."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in Cleveland this year.   Before giving a review it should be noted that the dining experience here for lunch is completely different than dinner. The menu changes dramatically for the two periods.  Dinner was a culinary masterpiece. Every item ordered was thoughtfully crafted and elegantly displayed. I ordered the duck squared. The dish was phenomenal. Crispy duck served two ways. It was drizzled with whipped strawberries and other fruits. The super sweet was perfectly balanced by salty napa cabbage served in a pastry.   The calamari appetizer was one of the best calamari dishes I've ever had. The flavor combinations were delicious with an emphasis on candied ginger.  We also ordered the chilled peach soup. This could have doubled as a dessert. It was a very sweet soup, perfect on a hot summer day. Instead of veggies, it was bursting with pureed fruits in a peachy cream broth.  All in all the food was amazing at prices $10-15 less than comparable entrees in restaurants in Tremont or on East 4th. You really get a great value for some incredibly thought out dishes."}
{"text":"Ate at The Willeyville and was surprised at how nice the place was. The name sounds like a rowdy bar with hotdogs, but it's anything but. We ordered the 'big plate of meat', poutine, cheeseboard, and for my entree ordered the meatloaf. The big plate of meat was very good and it's the first time I've seen chicken on a meat plate. Out of the cheeses, the smoked ricotta was my favorite. It was delicious. The cheese plate is served with a small bowl of rhubarb which was another first I've seen. The meatloaf presentation itself is a spectacle. It's served inside of a big bone with breaded bone marrow balls and sweet catsup all over the plate. It was very good, but honestly the catsup is what made the meatloaf really good.   The service was very good and it was very prompt. There weren't many people there, but I am sure that will change on weekends and once The Flats get more built up.  Edited to add I forgot we also ordered calamari and poutine. The poutine was unlike any poutine I had in Canada, but I would order it ANYTIME! Very good. The best poutine in Cleveland so far. I don't care for calamari, but the three people I was with polished it off happily and raved about the sweet peppers that came with it."}
{"text":"Went here with some fellow Yelpers after an event at Lago. I loved the ambiance inside and the lighting was really cool. I got the Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler with ice cream on top which was just okay. Actually for $8.50 I was a bit disappointed. I did sample some Proper Poutine from a friends plate and I thought this was a good appetizer, but who wouldn't enjoy fries covered in cheese and gravy?! Overall I think this place is pricey and would be best for just drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and I can't wait for my third time.  I've had the oysters, rigatoni, and I think it was duck carnitas with flour tortillas.  All three were absolutely delicious.  Our servers were knowledgeable and very attentive and couldn't have been better.  Their food and beer recommendations were spot on.  The bread is baked in house with their homemade flavored butters which vary by the day and both are spectacular.  I don't think it's possible to have bad food in this establishment.  It looks like they are always changing the menu, so I can't wait to try any new additions."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place for lunch.  Knowledgable and attentive staff, many organic items, all house made condiments, light yet satisfying.  Some very complex dishes.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"All we had were drinks. The shady lane was great. Everything was made from scratch down to the bitters and simple syrup. My dirty was pretty good, house made vermouth and blue cheese stuffed olives. I think I could live on blue cheese stuffed olives with the occasional gin to wash them down.  I was impressed by the menu only like 6 or 7 large plates, that means everything should perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch and service was extremely slow- it took over an hour and a half! I ordered the boxer hot dog which was good, but overpriced."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great here. The place was dead empty. I'd expect most places to be slow on a Monday night, but we were literally the only ones in there. I had the gnudi dish and it was phenomenal (very rich). Not the best beer list, but I managed. I have high hopes for this revamped area. For starters we had the poutine which was great and the calamari which was meh. All in all a great restaurant"}
{"text":"My meal here was so good.  I tried the pork belly ramen and gnudi and both were exceptional.  The tofu and the pork belly were the best I have had - excellently prepared.    They have outdoor seating.  The indoor portion would seat about 50.  Very pretty bar area.  The cocktails are excellent.   The peanut butter nutella ice cream was also delicious.    The parking lot and valet were 10$.    I think budget about 50$ a person for dinner/drink minimum but everything you consume will be thoughtfully executed."}
{"text":"This was an area I was sad to discover when I was leaving Cleveland.  According to the locals who were with us at dinner, this area used to be very dead.  Well, not anymore.  This place takes the farm to table concept and adds a twist.  The cocktails were to die for and I had two Moscow mules.  Needless to say, I always plan accordingly, and was not driving, so I enjoyed every drop of their home made ginger beer.  The starters were excellent, and I loved the poutine.  Like LOVED it.  My crusted sesame tuna was the hit of the table.  That's not to say that every other dish, from the pasta to the pork, wasn't perfect.  We skipped dessert because I was craving some local ice cream before leaving the city I have called home for one year, but if I'm every visiting the Cleve, I will definitely pass by Willeyville for drinks and lots and lots of yummy food."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm glad I had a terrible experience at Lago, 'cause I wound up over here instead. This is one of the best random finds I've had in a while!  As far as the interior goes, I sat at the bar and thought the atmosphere was spot on.  I could see the feeling of being cramped if this place was busy and I was at a table, but on a Monday night it was nice and relaxed so you couldn't go wrong no matter where you sat. The bartender was super friendly and knew his stuff, and I soon had the Holy Elixir in my hand.  Holy god was it delicious.  And strong. For food I followed it up with the Perfect Poutine, and I should qualify this by saying I've never had poutine before, but wow was this tasty (and a sizeable portion). I talked with some of the other serving staff while eating and everyone was friendly without so much as a hint of pretense.  For a place with food and drinks this good, that was a pleasant surprise.    The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't tried any of the major entrees. (If you just want poutine and delicious cocktails then yes, easily 5 stars.) Prices aren't bad, especially for a kitchen that's 100% from scratch, but on my social worker salary this qualifies as expensive. The menu is relatively small but changes with the seasons, which goes in line with their made-from-scratch kitchen.  I'm super excited to come back and give the rest of the menu a try! Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in The Land - if not my favorite. I love the atmosphere, people, and constantly changing menu at The Willeyville. This place is so well managed and I think the quality of service is hard to find anywhere else.   There's nothing I've eaten / drank here that I haven't loved in ~10+ visits. The gnudi, their burgers, the pork chop, fish tacos, kale pesto, and spinach and artichoke dip are among some of my favorites. They also always have a great fish dish prepared, and lately a few more experimental / Asian cuisine type offerings that are awesome. I make sure to eat here every time I am in Cleveland, and recommend to all of my friends who are visiting."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out for an early dinner before seeing a show downtown. I was with a few family members, 4 total. When I called earlier in the week, I was told that the only reservation available was for a bit earlier than I planned. I took the table, as I wanted to try the restaurant. I found it a bit strange that the restaurant was mostly empty through our entire dinner, including when we left.   Anyway, the food was just okay, especially for the price. The other 3 women at my table ordered the burgers and said they were good, but nothing special. I ordered the salmon tacos, which were tasty. I was expecting a bit more but it was overall just okay. Might try again at a different time of day or for happy hour."}
{"text":"I had not heard anything good about The Willeyville, so dining here was a low priority. I am now regretting all of the times I could have been here enjoying the delicious food!  PROS *Poutine, my new favorite app. We started off with the Proper Poutine, a heaping plate of artery-clogging goodness. Yes, it's not the best for you. Yes, you will enjoy every bite. Fries, gravy, curds, hot sauce, and whatever cracklins' are. Make sure to share. *Pasta. Typically at a new restaurant I would order meat for my entree, but I was just digging the description of the ricotta gnudi. And when the order came out, it exceeded all of my expectations. Little, fluffy balls of doughy goodness, covered in a rich white sauce, mixed with brussel sprouts and bacon bits. You cannot go wrong with this dish! *The menu. Based on the flimsy white paper that the menu was on along with their online menu not matching the menu we got at the restaurant, I'm assuming they change up their menu quite a bit. I like that in a restaurant - they know what works and they try new things when something isn't working *Decor and Ambiance. We came during the day, which was fine, but as I looked around, I decided that the ambiance would be much more dramatic at night. The industrial decorations and lighting gives it a trendy, urban look. *A lemonade-cider drink. I cannot remember what it's called, but it was basically like a summer lemonade mated with an autumn cider and had a baby. I approve.  CONS *If you are walking here, you'll have an easy time going down the hill to get to the East Bank of the Flats...but good luck trying to walk back up after you've stuffed yourself silly. My advice - call an uber. *The restaurant was smaller than I thought it was going to be, which is not necessarily a con...unless you bring a large group. I would limit the group to 8.  BOTTOM LINE I will be back to try some other creations on the menu. And gorge on poutine and pasta."}
{"text":"I wish it was possible to give this place no stars. My husband and I went in here to eat. Set there for ten minutes plus and no service. No drink orders, nothing. We travel all over the U.S. And have never been treated this way. Would NEVER go here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Unique, original, fresh, from scratch. Need I say more? We had the meatloaf and hanger steak and it was amazing. Also the root beer with real beer and the ice cream cookie sandwich. Decent wine list. Fried pickled veggies and wings were in point. Yum."}
{"text":"We went there in the evening for some after dinner drinks and dessert.  My guest had the Willey's Jamaican Planter's Punch, which was especially delicious.  Definitely worth getting again.  I got the Bitter Sweet, which was really much more bitter than sweet.  At times, it felt like I was trying to take medicine instead of enjoying a drink.  They were a little pricey for Cleveland ($11) a drink, but they definitely had a good dose of liquor in them.  The bread itself was pretty good, but the beet butter was eh.  It would have been really good butter if it was sold to us as just that, but the fact it had some sort of beets mixed in made it taste absolutely no different than normal butter.  We ordered the Ohio Apple Crisp with the house-made cinnamon sticky bun ice cream.  The crisp was absolutely delicious.  Apples had a great flavor and were soft but not yucky applesauce mush.  The ice cream had a wonderful mild flavor to it, but tasted more like vanilla ice cream than like a cinnamon sticky bun ice cream.  Overall not a bad experience, food was pretty good and depending on the drink you ordered, the drinks weren't bad either.  A bit pricey for what you got and for its location.  I would go back, but let's just say I wouldn't be dying for the chance to go back."}
{"text":"Walking around a crowded Cleveland afternoon, six young men were on the hunt for some lunch. However, the quest had only begun when these cursed souls entered into the Woodyville. The restaurant promised a shorter wait time than its surrounding neighbors, so the gang decided to endure a forty-five minute wait time. Leaving the establishment temporarily they returned an hour later, still not having received a text message to invite them back.  The six young men then waited, watching the half-empty yet unseat-able restaurant with hungry eyes, appearing to the inattentive staff like malnutritioned dogs patiently waiting for their abusive owner's next meal.  Next, the ticket time after finally placing an order was forty minutes exactly! The food leisurely served was not bad, however the hungry pack of men were disappointed by incorrect beef preparation and soggy buns. In short, don't go here. This is not a one-time mistake or a product of business (which the restaurant wasn't). The restaurant is understaffed as workers admitted, and while the food may be mediocre, its service-- 2 hours later -- was terrible."}
{"text":"I wasn't Yelping last year when Willeyville opened, but our first experience there was one of the most memorable of 2013. It was within a few weeks of opening, and while our waiter didn't know *exactly* what type of cured meats he had served us, he was so attentive, congenial and welcoming, I didn't care. Since then we've come back for date night and with several large parties, and our service experience has been equally professional and easygoing.  Three things are a must here: the charcuterie, the cocktails and the desserts. That's not to say I haven't had other awesome entrees and apps here, because I certainly have. But I've also had some plates that seemed like they might not have been perfected yet, or were the result of someone feeling extra adventurous that day. I'm completely ok with it, because I appreciate a restaurant that can take locally-sourced, house-made ingredients that don't seem to fit and make them work. This weekend I had gnocchi with mushrooms, brussel sprouts and bacon. A tad salty, maybe, but the Brussels were nicely grilled (& not mushy at all!) and I really couldn't stop myself from eating every single one of the ricotta gnocchis.   The cocktails: strong yet well-balanced. They don't shy away from savory stuff or unique combinations. The charcuterie: willeyville has by far the most varied and delicious selection in town. And they do it all themselves! The desserts: when summer comes, I just hope they bust out their ice cream sandwich with sweet corn ice cream and chipotle (poblano?) sugar cookie. So. Damn. Good.  That being said, I'm worried people are put off by the location? The parking? The fact that they aren't pretentious about all of their homemade goods? Who knows. For my part, I'm always impressed when I come here and look at the menu. It's always changing, and it's always a bit more fearless than some other similarly-branded restaurants in town. It remains the only place that has ever served me cheese jerky, for crying out loud."}
{"text":"Wow, excellent dinner and service. The ribs special was meaty ( not skimpy) cooked to perfection and spiced right. If they have that special and you like ribs consider that dish. The ricotta gnudi with their own special sausage and marinara sauce was delightful. Our tall Hendricks and tonics with cucumber were spot on."}
{"text":"A nice clean, spacious restaurant and bar! The food has never disappointed me (I'd recommend the poutine), and they have a great bar menu.  The staff has also been super friendly and helpful any time I'm in! Definitely not hoity toity, but classy for as laid back as it is! Also, good for groups."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the East bank of the Flats. We were there one week after it opened, and it was VERY slow (Wednesday night). Our server was dynamic and knowledgeable. The drinks were great -- I sipped my moscow mule and was happy! The food was good, too. I had the simple salad and the spicy kung pao brussels sprouts with ramen. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Cleveland. The menu changes seasonally and there are tons of great entrées. I had the whipped ricotta for an appetizer which was delicious and my boyfriend and I shared the flank steak and the shrimp macaroni and cheese. Everything was delicious and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I always worry about this place when I go, but not because of the great food and service. As one of the handful of places on the new west bank of the flats, and the one farthest from the hotel, it is all-too-often slow in here. That's a shame because it's worth the trip down there. Very creative new American food using local ingredients that are all house made. I can't keep this place going on my own, so I hope more people start finding it. It's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"First visit was through a Yelp event and I was so entranced by this place I had to come back. The drinks were fantastic. They had a Moscow Mule in a copper cup, as it should be consumed. The bartender told us that they used to serve it with a copper straw too, but people kept stealing the straws.....  The food was fantastic as well. I love the idea that they had the seasonal food. At the Yelp event there was a Jack O Lantern pumpkin soup that I ordered to go. The soup was fantastic, but I was told to come back because the soup normally comes in an actual pumpkin! I dragged the boy there to have some, but they no longer had the Jack O Lantern soup, as they had moved on.   While the food and drinks were wonderful, the ambience of the place is what keeps this place from being 4 stars for me. If you sit at the bar or a couple of the booths near the bar I assume it's fine, but we sat closer to the back of the restaurant and I just felt intrusive. As it was date night we were sitting at one of the 2 top tables along the wall. We were SO close to the couple next to us, almost awkwardly so. The waiters inputted orders right in front of us and had side conversations with each other, which I am fine with, but normally it's an \"out of sight, out of mind\" kind of thing. Also, from the back the restaurant loses its hipster, chic look and resembles more of a Chipotle restaurant layout.    If you only get their food and, well maybe not drinks, to go? 5 stars."}
{"text":"Traveled the world and a thousand seas and this spot rocks!!!  Great execution, unique ideas, and just plain old flavorful and enjoyable food.  Try their meatloaf, it's to die for.  The ricotta dip appetizer teases with it mild kick and the phenom home made bread they bring out.  The \"Chicken ate my Pig\" entree with its unreal pig-bacon marmalade was out of this world. The list of uniques keeps going on and on!  If you are in Cleveland, just go here. Great food, real great food, and have never given a 5 star, but these guys deserve it!"}
{"text":"i so wanted this to be a GREAT restaurant......such a cool location, neat interior, but food, just OK.......yeah, i get the relaxed, casual vibe but a hostess waltzing around the diningroom in black flip-flop......seemed like she stopped in from the pool to seat a few people........servers are friendly but a bit unpolished and untrained. they want to help, but just don't know what to do. and what's with the \"bananarama doo-rags\" in al lthe girls' hair?  decor is snazzy, comfortable and current......the menu feels a bit confused. is it  home-stlye comfort or upscale hip? i don't know, i don't think that the kitchen knew.  cocktails were great......had a couple of rounds. for apps we had the rock shrimp ceviche and the chacutterie (sp?) board.  the ceviche was served with flour tortilla chips, yuck, and the ceviche lacked any bit of acidity, despite the lime wedge garnish. i wouldn't order this again. the chacutterie board/plate was large with a wide variety of house cured meats....many of which were lack-lustre and seemed to be made by a meat curing trainee that hadn't quite figured it out yet. the liver pate was delicious, the other stuff- mortadella (not even close to being),  some terrible pork belly that seemed like boiled bacon sans the smoke and an \"almost\" proscuitto were gross, but the knockwurst....HEAVEN!!! so delicious, i could have eaten plates of this!!! our salads were a golden beet salad.......sounded good but disappointing! the beets were buried in a heavy layer of green weeds with sprinkles of tarragon topped with a smoked cheese of some sort. no acidity to balance the dish, just a bunch of mish-mash ingredients thrown into a weird shaped bowl a la 1999.  one slice of wonderful bread was given with cocktails, why? before i even had a chance to ask for a second slice with our salads, our butter, plates and silverware were scooped up. for dinner we had  the duck squared and the city chicken. i was confused by both. the carrot mash was delicious but the city chicken meat seemed over fried until hard and dry.  the duck squared was duck confit, a breast wrapped in bacon and thigh with leg served with some foamy carrot juice and traces of some sauce a feta cabbage strudel (which was the highlight of this dish) and beets. both entrees had the makings of a great dinner but never got there. homestyle seemed to be trumped by highbrow thoughts trumped by homestyle......food was good, but NOT great, nothing memorable! the highlight of the entire meal was dessert, even thought i really didn't want anything, i was talked into it and glad that i was!!! the chile sugar cookie ice cream sandwich, WOW!!! they could make a mint on selling this out of a truck for sure!!! a slightly spicy sugar cookie filled with a sweet corn ice cream......what an original idea that came to fruition!!! i could have eaten bowls full of that ice cream!!! we also had a rhubarb cumble topped with chamomile ice cream......the crumble, meh, not so good, but that chamomile ice cream, to die for!!!!! the real star of the night was the person responsible for the house made ice creams!!!!!! i think i would come here for drinks and dessert and skip the stuff in the middle........don't lose the ice cream \"chef\"----they're genius!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say I didn't enjoy my meal, but I can say it didn't deliver what was promised. Between the ramen that certainly didn't have that ramen flavor or the accompaniments to the caesar salad that really was more mediterranean than anything else. Also the price was a bit steep for the portions served. I'd try the restaurant again but keep in mind the menu listings seem to be more inspiration than anything else.  The waitstaff was really friendly though and I enjoyed the location."}
{"text":"The Flats are making a comeback, and The Willeyville is out front! This is a great addition to the new area. The decor is very chic and relaxing. There are large windows that let in a lot of natural light, so it is  great place to go on a sunny Cleveland day. I love the open kitchen lay out, so you can always see whats going on.  My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night at 7:30. We were able to make reservations on Open Table, which was a good thing, because this place was packed! The word is out that The Willeyville is the next restaurant to try in Cleveland. There was a mix of mid twenty somethings all of the way to people in their 50's and 60's.  We started with the shrimp ceviche, and it was the perfect amount to get us started. It came with some pita chips that were very complementary. We each ordered a drink... a glass of chardonnay for myself and a moscow mule for my man. I always love when a moscow mule comes in the traditional copper mug!! I ordered the bucatini alla matriciana and only needed the small size. It was the perfect amount of food. It had a slight spice to it from the chili, and it was absolutely delicious! The other meal for the table was the hanger steak, which the boyfriend gobbled up immediately.   This restaurant is going to be a great addition to the Flats and Cleveland. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Wileyville - if you're looking for flavor, look no further!  Ring ding dong,  ring a ding ding ding dong - keep your taste buds ringing.    Seriously the most flavorful food I have eaten in CLE.  When I say flavorful, I mean generous and appropriate use of spices and herbs, so not for a bland palette.  The restaurant is described as comfort food with a twist of sorts and I think it was appropriate description.  Ate there with a group of 5 people, enjoyed 2 appetizers and each ordered entrees - just the right amount of food.  I am a vegetarian and options were limited but I really enjoyed the ramen noodle bowl option with a delicious ginger soy sauce - again really flavorful, packing some heat, very bold offerings!  Expansive drink menu, I had a great glass of wine and my husband describes his cocktails as 4 stars (out of 5).  One watch out is that this place is super pricy, but a cool dining experience nonetheless.  Really friendly staff working there, seemed informed about the food (local sourcing, made from scratch).    Also be prepared to pay for your own parking, they do not validate.  This seems common in that area."}
{"text":"The is Cleveland's Hidden gem I started with the chicken wings which were really really good I had the hanger steak which was out of this world  My partner had the pork shoulder which was really good also  The price was very reasonable. You can feel the chefs heart his creations"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Dined solo at the bar. Friendly staff, creative menu, decent beer/wine selection."}
{"text":"First visit to this place; the ambiance is sophisticated without being too high-brow.  As for the food, I ordered the poutine, and friends ordered the berry cobbler.  Service was good.  Food was nothing special, and I was not offered a box for the leftovers."}
{"text":"My wife have dined at quite a few places on the east bank of the flats. This place by far was our favorite. We were impressed by the drinks, appetizers, dinner and desserts. The chef even came to our table to see how we liked everything. The atmosphere wasn't stuffy since guests were dressed casually up to a guests snazzed up for a night on the town.   We've recommend Willeyville to many of our friends and have seen them post from there on Facebook thoroughly enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"The Willeyville is an exceptional Cleveland secret. The food, while not your average fare, is always fantastic and keeps you coming back for more. Don't expect anything standard here... Instead, come in with an open mind and be prepared to be amazed. As a (very) occasional meat eater I tried the short ribs tonight and enjoyed every single bite. The sorbets were an amazing pallet cleanser too and can't be missed.   On top of an amazing menu, the staff sincerely care about the guests and want you to enjoy every sip/bite. After a few years the owner still takes an active role in addressing tables and supporting the staff.  We don't live close enough to make this a weekly stop but definitely make it a point to check it out a few times a year!!  Try it next time you are in the area, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was really exceptional. I definitely recommend it as a date spot, just expect to drop a little cash. The Chicken are the pig was awesome, very filling and the marmalade was on point. The apple cobbler was great as well perfect way to end the meal. For sure will be headed back in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  It's my new fave downtown eatery. They serve an amazing chef's salad with delicious humus, crostini, and succulent chicken that's a fave lunch. I had the pasta special last night with a creamy vodka sauce over a thick, tubular lpasta that was AMAZING. And though I'd RARELY eat anything like a chili dog (not a big meat person) their chili dog and schnitzel is to die for. LOVE WILlEYVILLE!!  You will too!"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks, great food, excellent service. We came for dinner and trivia: the salmon was perfect, and drinks perfect."}
{"text":"Sauerkraut balls...more ham and corned beef than sauerkraut. So meatlovers will love these, but I just wanted more sauerkraut.  The balls were accompanied by 2 different sauces: a horseradish sauce and a honey mustard.  The honey mustard was sweet and I liked it better with the ham in the balls than the other sauce.  Together the sauce and balls reminded me of corndogs.   I also enjoyed a nice red blend, and since it was happy hour (3 to 7- I love when happy hour goes past 6!), the wine was $2 off.  I am very interested in going back to try more memu items."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner, and was a little hesitant because after a long drive I wasn't quite in the \"foodie\" mood, but it was close to my hotel so I figured why not. The bread came out with a kale based pesto, normally I'm not a kale fan it this was delicious. I settled on the Asian braised spare ribs which were amazingly tender and had just the right amount of flavor and was by far one of the best preparations of spare ribs I have had. I did swap out the red cabbage with the plate for the polenta which had a good combination of flavors but something seemed a bit off in the ratios of ingredients, if I came back for another visit is like choose a different option. Overall I was very impressed."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot dog here and wasn't impressed. The hot dog was so tough that I could barely cut it with a fork and knife. The bun was also a bit dried out and hard. The space is beautiful though and in a great new location."}
{"text":"I think I'm being generous with 3 stars, was really leaning toward 2.  Decided to go based on positive yelp reviews.  It was Monday evening, the Indians had a home game so I get it, it was a bit slow.  I sat at the bar for dinner.  Nice conversation with the bartender to get things started but then it was kind of downhill.  Calamari was good - not exceptional, but very good. Placed my order for salad (bibb salad - good, but needed some gorgonzola or something to counter too many cherries) and entrée (small bucatini - good but overcooked pasta - needed to be al dente).  Never brought my glass of wine until I reminded the bartender that I ordered it and WTF, they only serve bread to certain customers?  My bread plate sat empty all night while the bartender poured herself some chocolate Teddy Grahams (overheard her say to another customer \"they don't serve us here\") in between texting on her phone...service just fell off - it's about the customer experience and the food and Willeyville disappointed in the service department...who allows bartenders to openly text in front of paying customers when they should be asking I would like any bread at all!!  Hard for me to recommend this place to be honest.  A group of ladies seated behind me asked the hostess to remove some dead bugs from the area on their way out....someone better pay attention to the small things at Willeyville - it's not the customer's job."}
{"text":"Willeyville- surprised me up the wahoo.  I had heard of how \"great\" the Flats were, but as I moved into Cleveland 3 years ago, I never got to see the Flats in its greatness. Nonetheless, I'm glad to see that they're building up the area with an Aloft hotel, and some new great restaurants, like Willeyville.  I made reservations for 6 people at 8pm on a Saturday night. For a new place, I thought it would be pretty empty...but man, it was packed!   Their menu boasts \"handcrafted consumables\" and man, is it unique. Our friends ordered the \"chicken ate my chicken\"- a stuffed sausage in chicken dish- which they claimed was excellent. The menu also had an extensive cocktail list and also a lot of unique delectable dishes.  My bf and I split a few dishes to get the most bang for our buck. First, we got the mussel poutine. Yes, poutine, and yes, we are not in Canada. The mussels were great, with a slightly cheesy flavorful sauce drizzled on top of some nicely fried fries. Mmmmm. We also ordered the gnocchi, which came with summer squash as well. We were a bit surprised at how it came- we had originally thought gnocchi were little pasta balls..and was surprised when it came out as a flat folded noodle. We bit into it- and yep, it was definitely gnocchi- it was deceivingly small, but heavy and oh so good!  We also ordered their special- a beef heart chili cheese dog. As I loved the chili cheese dogs from Detroit's coney islands, I didn't think it could match. Oh, it definitely matched and was GOOD. It had that special \"snap\" to it that hot dogs should, when you bite into it, and the beef heart chili was so hearty (no pun intended) and savory, it was pretty amazing.  Willeyville has great food and a great atmosphere. The only downside is that the parking lot is $6- as for the area (there's like nothing around it), I didn't think was worth it. We parked on the street...but yeah, besides that, the food was excellent, and I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Worst in the area.   Over priced.  The BBQ sauce was super bland.    They are nice but that don't help."}
{"text":"OK so I ate here last night with some friends, and I have to say it was pretty good, although I wasn't too crazy about the prices due to the fact that I am a poor individual LOL I did really enjoy the Wiley moooo burger also I had a little bit of my friends proper poutine and it was delicious I deathly plan on going back next time with a little bit extra cash in my pocket. if you go plan for a small group no more than six maybe eight The inside is real cool and the staff are quick and food presentation is beautiful I give it three out of five"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! Our first dinner here was a completely random choice with no reservations. We walked in and were seated immediately. We were greeted by the most amazing waiter and our order was taken promptly. The smoked wings we ordered for the appetizer were the best I ever ate, filled with flavor. The Bibb salad I ordered was also excellent. The homemade dressing was very good. The pork shank I ordered was very tender and full of delicious flavor. It fell right off the bone. The creme brulee we had for dessert was definitely the perfect ending to our meal. Overall a delightful dining experience. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Dinner is always great, until someone gets sick later. Definitely had food poisoning from some of the meat the ruined a perfectly great date night.   Meal started off great. Excellent appetizers and great alcohol pairings. After the kitchen got the significant other's dish wrong that's when things took a turn for the worse.   In the mean time, while I was enjoying my meal, the staff brought out a rather delicious bowl of sorbet. I especially enjoyed it after the significant other was put off by the spice and heat. I would have preferred if they would have asked what she wanted first. Later, after a quick dish turn around, things took a turn for the worse (aka don't under-cook a dish to get it out quickly).  Upon arriving home, all hell broke loose - quite literally. Hours of purging later, this have sort-of settled down. The only resolution, we will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Yum. Delish. I had the meatloaf with bone marrow tots and mashed potatoes. It was served in the bone. Loved it. Friendly staff with local brews on tap. A bit pricey, but I find that to be a trend here in Cleveland. I'd defiantly come back again if I lived near by."}
{"text":"I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the ribs. The salmon is amazing and perfectly cooked. It came with a delicious farro mix and was perfectly seasoned.  My boyfriends ribs weren't the best ribs I ever had, but they were still tasty and moist.   I would definitely come back on another casual dinner date."}
{"text":"Food was so-so. Got the pad thai as my meal and it was not good at all. It was very soupy and way too sweet. The appetizers weren't bad. We got the poutine and the queso. It was good to try but wouldn't get again. The caprese salad was good and would get it again. The atmosphere was good and service was good."}
