{"text":"Finally a museum cafe that doesn't have pedestrian chicken fingers and fries.  After spending nearly two-and-a-half hours in the museum, my friend and I were ready for some food. We decided to see what the cafe had and were impressed. I had the day's quesadilla which had smoked trout, scallions, and horseradish cheese. My tastebuds were thrilled. The field greens salad was also a delight.   I am sure I could have easily paid more than $10 for the same meal at any other museum cafe. Worth every penny. And those pennies saved can be used to buy something at the gift located right next to the cafe."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday. Food was really good, service was good, just REALLY slow. 1 cook & 1 server."}
{"text":"Great iced tea! Helpful staff but not overly friendly. I would suggest sitting outside! It is was just lovely out on the patio!"}
{"text":"One of best kept secrets in the north side. The food is wonderful and utterly delicious. We had lunch there one day without going to the Mattress Factory Museum and it was one of the best lunches that I have ever had. Red Ribbon sodas are available.  Well worth the trip to the north side."}
{"text":"I tried the veggie chili at the yelp bash.  So tasty!  I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Stop in here after checking out the museum exhibits or just stop in for a cup of coffee, avocado toast, and relaxing atmosphere. Tables are plenty big to get some work done, so it is a great place to meet up for business, as well as pleasure."}
{"text":"The mango chutney chicken salad was amazing. The sandwiches are really big, so you could probably split one sandwich if you're just looking for a light lunch. The smoked salmon omelet was fine, but boring compared to the mango chutney chicken salad."}
{"text":"Delicious food and happy people. Split the quinoa salad and a black bean burger with a friend - both were yummy! You could see the beans in the burger and it had fresh sliced avocados making it even yummier! Vegetarian chili was also very tasty. I've been to hundreds of museum cafes all over the world, this is one of the best. Fresh, real food."}
{"text":"Before heading into the exhibits at the Mattress Factory, I stopped by the cafe to grab a quick lunch and the experience was better than I expected! My past experiences at museum cafes mostly consisted of eating average tasting but extremely expensive food. The food at Mattress Factory cafe was very yummy and also reasonably priced.  I ordered the Coca Sandwich which was a fried egg sandwich with mashed avocado and kimchi on grilled sourdough. It definitely packed a lot of flavor and quite some spice as well. The sandwich was well portioned and also came with a side salad.  If you check in on Yelp, you also get a free cup of coffee with free refills. The service was also wonderful. If you're in a hurry and need to find a quick bite to eat in between museums, I highly recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"Very fresh with lots of flavor. Everything was very fresh and staff were very friendly and helpful. Terrific lunch. Adjacent to a great store."}
{"text":"The food is good, service terrible! Waited close to 15 minutes for coffee, then never got a refill. There were only 4 people in the whole place. Ordered a soup, was told it came with toast, it did!!! But was charged $7.75 for 2 pieces of toast with a bit of cheese....and when disputed the waitress was nowhere to be found??? Then the lady taking payment forgot to add my membership discount. The Mattress Factory is a great place, just eat elsewhere. The Coca Cafe staff at the location are horrible. 1 coffee, 1 sandwich, soup and toast, $30+tip....not bad if the staff was great."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch with the girls at Mattress Factory Cafe.  What is great about this place is everything is made fresh and such great quality.  The tomato,roasted pepper and goat cheese soup is fantastic and the banana bread with sliced fruit is a delicious accompaniment.  The bread is grilled and comes with a cream cheese spread.  This is a great place for a leisurely bite to eat...you cannot be in a hurry to enjoy what there is to offer here."}
{"text":"Passionfruit + coconut + cupcake = decadent mouth party  That is exactly what happened when I tried that delicious treat after my tour of the Mattress Factory one afternoon. The passionfruit frosting was one of the most delicious creations my taste buds have ever witnessed. On top of that it was beautifully presented and the cafe is quaint and lovely."}
{"text":"I'm so jazzed about this cafe I could yell from rooftops. Located in the lobby of a Pittsburgh must-see, Mattress Factory Art Museum, this tiny cafe is a hidden treasure in a building already chock full of wonders.   The day's menu featured a fig and cheese quesadilla that was surprisingly delightful and unnerving and a bargain at $6.95. It came with a side of a wacky hybrid orzo/couscous pasta with a dream inducing nutty flavor.  The field greens were fresh and bright and the soup was stupendous if not on the cool side. It's really hard to get over the prices. A soup/salad combo is about 5 bucks which is unheard of for a museum and anywhere really. Coffee is rich and strong and service was just icing on our little cake. I will make it a point to eat here even if I don't go into the museum. Mmmm, I drool at the memory.."}
{"text":"AMAZING. I was so happy with the avocado and tomato toast (it had a drizzle of honey on top) and the banana walnut bread (came with honey maple cream cheese and fruit). It was honestly such a healthy and delicious brunch and the cheerful ambience of the caf√© is also quite exquisite. Definitely want to come here again."}
