{"text":"Amazing authentic Ethiopian! This place deserves to be packed since its the only Ethiopian in the city, but even if the were twenty, it would still probably be my favorite. If you want to try a completely new cuisine, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"To start with, the food was very very tasty. Loved the flavors and the spices underlying them. Quite honestly, I believe that you could basically order anything and love it. Ethiopian for those who haven't tried it before generally includes eating food with your hands on a bready-pancake like food where all over your selections are placed upon allowing the tastes from those selections to seep into the bread.
Expect portions to be filling and fairly large.

Now that said, I will admit this won't be the best written review because every review should tell you what that person had and ideally include a photo. I'm admittedly doing neither mainly because I did love the food and it was already halfway gone when I realized I should have taken a picture.

Why 3 stars? I came here with my mom who had heard about the restaurant in an article and wanted to try it out. We went in for lunch at about 12:45pm and even though the standing sign outside displayed their hours and said they were open, the sign on the door said closed. We tested the door anyway and found it to be open.

Me made our way inside and were struck by how dark it was (it was a cloudy day outside and there were no lights on in the restaurant) and secondly by how empty and bizarre it felt. The only light coming in was natural from the windows. The music added to that obscenely strange atmosphere. It was the WQED station on the radio playing a rather dark and mysterious piece.

Needless to say, we stayed, and enjoyed a wonderful meal. However, service was a strange element as well. It took 20 minutes or so for food to come out which is fine but once we were finished with our meal, we waited half an hour looking for someone to take our check. Since we were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time we were there for lunch on that Friday, we would have expected them to be a bit more attentive. It wasn't until we finally hunted someone down in the back of the restaurant that we were able to pay and leave.

The food earns this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars. However, service and ambiance kept it from receiving a full 5."}
{"text":"Staying in East Liberty, we went to Tana as a more interesting alternative to the hipper places in Shadyside.  We ordered a veg assortment and a meat assortment to get the widest selection and were very happy with everything.  We opted out of the two hot choices, and all but one of what we got were considerably less spicy than assortments we'd eaten in DC Ethiopian restaurants, but nonetheless quite flavorful.
Tana's usual injera is made with teff, rye, and wheat, not good for my need for gluten free.  I mentioned this and was offered their rice option which would have been fine but not the Ethiopian experience, of course.  But that day they had some teff flour just in from DC! ... so offered to make some GF pure teff injera.  Perfect.
Service was great.  Ambience meh but fine.
We'd go back."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, OK atmosphere.  Try the sampler platters to get a bit of almost everything!  Don't be afraid, you silly gringos!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, definitely not the best Ethiopian food I've had though. Honestly, no one cooks like family! But I thought the meats were seasoned and savory. If you do not eat meat then Ethiopian food is perfect for you too, there are plenty of options for vegetarians. The servers were friendly and helpful. Prices are decent and I love tej (Ethiopian honey wine) it's super sweet! Definitely will be going again."}
{"text":"Tana is awesome.  i live in new york now and i am amazed to come back to pittsburgh and find ethiopian food!  i have tried both the ethiopian places in east liberty now, and i must say... i think i favor tana slightly.  my boyfriend and i always get vegetarian combos.  this one had generous portions of all our favorite dishes, very nice flavor, and excellent, delicious injera.  we will definitely return on our next trip to PA."}
{"text":"If you've never had Ethiopian food, you will probably enjoy this rather watered down version just fine. But it's clear this spot is benefiting from being the only Ethiopian restaurant in town. The ingira was flat, not spongy. All the dishes were over salted and under seasoned. You didn't get that sense of multiple layers of flavor, except for the lentils. Just wait till you visit your friends in Philly."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, and when I found Tana in Pittsburgh, I fell in love! I had been to Abay around the corner (funny how two Ethiopian restaurants ended up right next to each other) and I liked it much more than Abay. I felt it had a more authentic taste and the atmosphere was great with live music! The food portions were huge, and there was a bar, which was really nice. I also got a discount with my student ID (15% off the two vegetarian dishes we got), which was a big plus, which they said would be valid until the end of the year. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant. Great food and friendly staff. Served in a traditional manner. You have to ask for silverware if you want it but I strongly recommend eating it in the way it was intended. Break off some \"bread\" and scoop up the delicious food with it. It's a very social way to eat and provides an atmosphere for conversation and  comradery. 
Go there now!!"}
{"text":"Food: Tana offers standard Ethiopian cuisine, which is centered around an injera (spongy flat bread) topped with delicious items of your choosing, and the menu also offers multiple appetizers and soups to get you started.  If you're a hungry vegetarian, its tough to get a healthier, better tasting meal in Pittsburgh, but there are plenty of meat options for carnivores as well.  For our appetizer, we ordered the potato salad, which was a generous portion of potatoes covered in vinegar and spices, and we were't disappointed.  It was delicious and enough to share.  We followed with lentil soup, which came out piping hot, was more than we expected, and was also quite tasty.  Fuller than we anticipated after the first two courses, we pushed forward toward the entrees.  For the main course, there are two choices; an individual order of one of the menu items atop your injera along with two sides, or a sampler including smaller portions of multiple menu items.  The sampler permits up to 5 choices and can include only vegetarian options or a combination of meat and vegetarian options.  There are 9 total vegetarian options, so with each of us ordering the vegetarian sampler, we were able to taste all of them.  Its not often that a restaurant bats 1.000 (even .500 would have been impressive), but all 9 of the items were fantastic.  Some are cold, some are hot, but they are all so good it is difficult to recommend only one or even rank them.  The sampler is definitely the way to go though, so that you can taste the plethora of flavors Tana has to offer, which span the spectrums of flavor and texture.  The combination of vegetables and spices is not likely to be something you would have at home or anywhere else.  You'll leave Tana full without feeling even remotely guilty about it.  

Price: All appetizers and soups are $4.50 and individual menu items range from $12-15.  The vegetarian sampler is $15 per person, and the meat sampler is $20 per person.  We ordered one appetizer, two soups, two samplers, and two drinks, and paid under $70 with tip included.  Plus, we had enough food left to bring some home.  A sampler alone is a lot of food, so you can easily eat your fill for under $20 per person.

Drinks: Tana has a full service bar in addition to a small beer and wine list, which includes Ethiopian beers and honey wines (similar to mead).  We tried the St. George, which according to our waiter was the \"Yuengling of Ethiopia\" (it was better than that).

Atmosphere: Tana is located on Baum Blvd. across from PNC Bank, somewhat isolated from the developing East Liberty area near Penn Circle.  The dining room, which is up a flight of steps, is huge and offers tables of all sizes including some next to a window overlooking Baum Blvd.  There is also a small bar with a large flat-screen television.  You could enjoy a cocktail while waiting for your table, but it seems unlikely that you will have to wait.  We went on a Saturday evening, and the dining room was nearly empty.  We had no wait and our choice of table.  

Service: Due to the lack of patrons, our waiter was able to almost exclusively focus on our table.  He answered our questions and explained menu items, checked on us routinely, and filled our water often.  He also asked if we liked the specific menu items he answered questions about or recommended.  One suggestion for potential improvement would be to explain what the different items on the sampler were when it is delivered to the table.  We had to figure out on our own which items were which, which may have made dinner more interesting.  The owner/manager personally came to our table to ask if we had enjoyed our meal, and he was very personable and friendly.  Tana is also open until 11PM on weekends, and they happily welcomed a couple that just arrived at 10:30.

(+): unique, healthy, great-tasting food, fair prices, good service, bar

(-): odd location

Would I go back again? Absolutely.  It appears as if Tana needs some support, and it deserves it.  Visit this restaurant before it disappears.  Don't let the lack of buzz, location, or little-brother relationship to Pittsburgh's other Ethiopian restaurant fool you, Tana is the real deal."}
{"text":"Went with friends on a Friday night . Good food I liked the Veg sides . We ordered chicken,lamb and beef. I like the lamb dish the most . The bread was cold not sure if they always serve that way."}
{"text":"Great meal - went to Tana with a group of ten. I called ahead to make a reservation and we worked on a plan for the meal ahead of time. We ordered appetizers and 2 large sampler platters with a mix of meat and vegetable dishes. Everyone found something they liked and we loved the variety. Perfect was to try a lot of different menu items. We had vegetarians as well as a range of spice lovers to spice novices. Some of the simple dishes were amongst the favorites - cabbage, lentils, cold potato salad. The meat dishes were all delicious too. 

Fun evening and great for a group!"}
{"text":"Tana is excellent! The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly! We will definitely be returning for more authentic Ethiopian treats."}
{"text":"Terrific food, great service and very reasonably priced - we go every time we're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The fact that Pittsburgh has one Ethiopian restaurant is pretty amazing.  But two?  Wow.  The BF and I decided to go to Tana after seeing the jaw-dropping line in front of Abay.  I'm definitely no expert on Ethiopian dining--our dinner at Tana marks the third Ethiopian restaurant I've been to in my life, as opposed to the bajillion Italian joints, sushi bars, and greasy spoons--but I was pleased.  On our visit, the staff was particularly accommodating and friendly--and native Ethiopians, I might add (no white chick waitresses a la Abay).  We'd armed ourselves with a bottle of red wine for our first BYOB choice, and despite the full bar offered at Tana, our host had no problem uncorking our Malbec.  The menu was similar to, you know, the OTHER restaurant: simple, well-spiced dishes that ranged from savory to smoky-hot.  I enjoyed a hodgepodge of vegetarian dishes served both cold and warm, and we received extra injera without having to request it, thanks to our waiter's keen eye.  

The food was good quality, nothing too mind-blowing, but the best part was easily the ambiance.  Tana features Ethiopian artwork on the walls and African music on their stereo system that inspired a bunch of patrons to get up and dance.  They were joined by our host/waiter.  The food at Abay is delicious, but I've never witnessed an impromptu dance party there.  Nice, relaxed atmosphere + pretty good food + awesome berbere = a decent Pittsburgh Ethiopian place.

(P.S. If you can, check out their Saturday coffee ceremony.)"}
{"text":"I went to Tana for the first time this week.  I have been to Abay a couple of times but that was a while ago.  It has been too long to compare Tana's food to Abay's, but it was absolutely delicious.  We each got a sampler (one meat and one veg) and shared.  The service was excellent - our waiter was very friendly, attentive, and gave tasty recommendations.  We came in around 6 on a Weds and didn't wait at all.  The neighborhood isn't my favorite, but we were both able to park right out front which was nice.  The reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the location and the prices.  It's a little pricey when it's all said and done but worth it once in a while.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat...I'm very health conscious and it can be hard to treat myself to something \"healthy\" when I want to enjoy myself out on the town. Speaking from experience, it's also no easy feat to make stuff like lentils and collard greens, with no nasty processed ingredients, this delicious. This is one of the few restaurants in Pittsburgh where I can indulge in something that is actually good for me - the best of both worlds.

In a perfect world, they would offer gluten-free injera, like some of the Ethiopian places I've been to in DC, etc. Also, the service can be a bit slow...but it's a family-run joint and everything is homemade on the premises, so that's par for the course, as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, and amazing customer service!!! The lady, who I think was the owner, brought over extra food for us  (free of charge) because she noticed we had to wait a little long for our main course. Big gold star for that! Then, upon hearing it was my husband's birthday, at the end of the meal - they brought him a huge slice of chocolate cake / candle & all - & sang him H Bday! And - cake was on the house too. Really? So amazingly sweet. They really made our great night unbelievably fantastic. Five stars, hands-down"}
{"text":"Charming place. Great vegetarian entrees. Fossilia was my favorite. I got a veg entree which came with two sides on the traditional bread which was so filling and only $12. Also got the split peas and ground chickpeas which were good- the latter had a lot of flavors."}
{"text":"I think it was an ok place. The bread there is a million times better than the bread at the place down the block. Its in a sort of random location, as there isn't a single business on the entire block, but hey, its nice to see business. The food was pretty nice, I would have liked to have had a little more for my $14 ( I got maybe a handful of beef, and since I was with a friend, I feel like I got less since they filled a tray for the both of us), but the waiter brought us more bread for free to finish our plates and we got free coffee.
 As for all the people who are saying, hey why are there two ethiopian places in one neighborhood? Who cares? It's business."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian I've had in Pittsburgh, great for my occasional Ethiopian cravings. I've had better, but only in larger cities which have bigger Ethiopian populations (D.C. and NYC).  The dinner portions seemed smaller than the first time I ate here.  You have to option of a few different samplers, or a single entree with a choice of two sides. Everything is flavorful, but not overly hot or spicy. 
They have live music at times, which is nice but way too loud for dinner.  They do have a bar and North African wine and beer options.  Personally, I wouldn't have the wine again, but I don't like overly sweet wine.  Great vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"I always seek out the Ethiopian restaurants in a city and was pleased to find this one, especially after another one nearby recently closed.  The menu offerings are pretty standard--meaning nothing feels like it it is missing.  The meals are about $15 and are generous in size and with a great selection (1 meat + any 2 veggies on injera).  The meat was just a little bit greasy, but still good.  I'll be back there again soon for more berbere (one of my favorite spices)."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good food...not the best I've ever had, but I'd certainly go again. Amazing atmosphere, at least on weds jazz night."}
{"text":"To start with this is the one and only place for Ethiopian food in this town and it's not bad. The restaurant is simple decorated, clean, and spacious. The service was good, the waiter hurried to bring the ordered tea as we came in on a freezing day which we very much appreciated and he checked back on us throughout dinner. 
The food was good too, flavorful like Ethiopian food should be and not too spicy. While I had better Ethiopian food in DC, this still is a great place to come to eat with your hands and experience a different kind of food. 
They also have a lot of vegetarian options compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"My long-time fave for Ethopian in the PGH, the vegetarian sampler is amazing... as long as the injera is fresh.   They've also allowed me to be somewhat creative with the menu, picking some of the app options in my veggie sampler (the potato salad is real good).

I've never experienced a wait, which makes me feel that it is one of the best kept secrets in E. Liberty.  And with some of the best, fresh vegan eating in the area, there is no good reason that it is a secret (the menu has meat options, too).

Go there, eat with your hands, treat yourself to a cold Meta or St. George (Ethopian Beers), and have yourself a good ol' time."}
{"text":"I ate Ethiopian here for the second time. I enjoyed the food.

Eating with hands gets a bit messy towards the end.

Will come here again."}
{"text":"Wanted to give an update since I have returned since my first review. A group of us doing a weekend meditation retreat met up here and I'm happy to report the food was delicious. I was totally pleased. I truly hated leaving that first review--it made me feel like a big jerk. I'm so happy my second experience was so so tasty."}
{"text":"I went to Tana for the second time with friends tonight. 

In addition to the vegetarian sampler being as uniquely delicious as I remembered, the waitress noticed birthday gifts and brought out an ENORMOUS slice of some of the best dark chocolate cake I've ever had. Among four of us, we couldn't finish the slice (after our very filling meal). 

I feel like an idiot for not snapping a picture, but seriously: it was majestic, it was magnificent...GET THE CAAAAAKE. 

The waitress also let us try a sample of a dish that we were curious about (on top of our meals); extremely thoughtful and appreciated (and now we know that the split peas rule too!)"}
{"text":"They have a tikil gomen which is out of this world. Additionally, the collards and beet salad are marvelous, the cabbage soup is terrific, and I have watched as other people verified that the lamb and beef are just as good. The servers are very sweet, the mood is mellow, the honey wine is lovely - and they have the World Cup playing at the bar! What better way to spend a Happy Hour than sitting at the bar watching soccer and eating Ethiopian food? You tell me, smart guy."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the visit. Stopped in on a Wednesday, with the live jazz. Great time."}
{"text":"My friend took me there for my birthday dinner and the food I ordered were so delicious! My first time to eat Injera and it was good!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday evening. The restaurant wasn't crowded and we were promptly seated. The ambience is laid back and casual with scriptures and photos of Ethiopia I guess which is an attempt to make it seem authentic but appears out of place. The food was very good. My wife got a vegetarian sampler and each one of her dishes were really tasty. I ordered chicken wot which came out really delicious along with two other veggie samplers, the name of which escapes me. Overall a very good option for vegetarians and kind of all right option for non vegetarians. Since I have never been to Ethiopia, I cannot comment upon the authenticity of the food!"}
{"text":"Come for the food, not for the service or ambiance.  

The food is good, though inconsistent.   Here's an exchange I heard on my visit: 
Costumer:  Is this chicken supposed to be cold?
Server: No
Customer: I don't want it.  
Server: Ok.  

No apology. No attempt to make amends.   This breaks every rule of a service business.  There's little regard for the diner.  The server and a few other people seemed preoccupied at the bar even though there were only two tables dining.  It shouldn't be difficult to get the server's attention where there are only five people eating.  

As some other reviewer's have noted, the place was absolutely dead.  It was so quiet, it made us uncomfortable.  

That said, the food is pretty good.  My chicken--and yes, I did order the chicken anyway--was cooked well, and was warm-ish.  It wasn't undercooked, but it was clearly (partially) reheated. The injera was the best part of the meal, and the vegetarian options are quite good.

Pittsburgh desperately needs a good Ethiopian, particularly now that Abay is gone, and Tana could be that place.  It's just not there yet."}
{"text":"This review is from an avid Ethiopian cuisine zealot, so readers beware!

When I strolled into this restaurant on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I didn't expect much because, well, it's Pittsburgh, PA, not little Ethiopia.  Hailing from DC, I of course have high standards.  Though I tried my best to give this restaurant's food a higher star rating, it just can't compare with other Ethiopian restaurants.  

Since sampling one item is not the most exciting way to judge the food, it's always my preference to order a veggie combination platter.  I appreciated their option to allow diners to choose 5 items, so I chose freely: kik alicha, shiro wat, ye abesha gomen, tikil gomen and fossolia.  Among these 5 standards, it's normally difficult for me to identify a favorite.  However, Tana made it easy for me: the one that was properly cooked was my favorite.  The kik alicha was undercooked such that some of the yellow spilt peas were like soft pebbles.  The shiro wat was spicy, but flavor development was sorely lacking.  The tikil gomen was greasy and like the shiro wat, lacked the depth of flavor of either fresh cooking or complex seasoning.  The tikil gomen was decent, but had likely been cooked quite a while ago--at least it wasn't greasy.  The fossolia was the best of the batch, but not fabulous by my standards.  Like the tikil gomen, it was greasy.  Unlike the kik alicha, at least the vegetables (carrots and green beans) were well cooked.  Still, the fossolia had a mild tomato paste flavor rather than the complex flavors that normally accompany stewed Ethiopian-style vegetables.

However, the dish that sealed the restaurant's rating at 2 stars: the injera tasted like white flour with a touch of sourness.  Injera should have teff flour, whether in a blend with wheat flour and/or other flours.  I could have made this injera at my home and have been more satisfied.  Perhaps it was because I ordered take-out that the kitchen decided to provide such a poor showing of quality injera and stewed vegetables?  Moreover, there was NO additional injera with which to eat the food, only the lone piece that was the \"plate\" and \"wrapper.\"  Very disappointing.

In DC, a sampler can be purchased for $10 (less in some restaurants), which will come with one if not two pieces of injera (other than the \"plate\"/ \"wrapper\").

I appreciate that this restaurant is in Pittsburgh, and I would encourage people to try it to enjoy a different style of eating and cuisine.  However, please don't judge all Ethiopian restaurants by this one.  It is sufficient when there aren't better options in the area, but it pales in comparison to the quality and price of many DC area (aka Little Ethiopia!!) restaurants."}
{"text":"A new eating experience for all of Pittsburgh. Ethiopians eat with their hands but they will provide utensils , if asked. The food and coffee are delicious. I highly recommend Tana. In my opinion it was better than the now closed Abay Restaurant!! A wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"While this is not one of the better Ethiopian restaurants that I've been to, it is very accessible for someone that has never ventured into any African cuisine. The choices on the menu are more westernized and recognizable but still pretty good. Unfortunately almost every time I have gone here the food quality has been different. When I order over the phone my order is also often misheard. Service is good here but I find their prices a little high compared to every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to. But I understand that when you have no competition--you can make your own price. Overall, good place to introduce yourself to a new cuisine but not the best quality."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I will never step foot in this restaurant again. I came here with my friends for a cultural experience and I walked away nauseated and ashamed by the fact that I had just paid $15 for a meal. Not only was the atmosphere stale, depressing, and down right weird, but the food had HAIR in it. The first piece of meat my friend picked up had hair wrapped around it. We tried not to make a big deal out of it and continued to eat, until later we found an eyelash in it, as well. Also not to mention our waitress knew almost nothing about the menu. When we asked what she recommended she told us she really had not tried anything on the menu and suggested things based on what she's heard others have liked. Overall, this experience was dismal. I will never return and I feel sick thinking about the hair in my food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving Ethiopian food and came here and were not disappointed. It is a bit pricey but worth every dollar of it. I just wish they had Hakim stout in stock."}
{"text":"I never had Ethiopian food before, so Tana's was my first time. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I first came in, but the waiter was so friendly and helpful. He gave us a brief explanation of the menu and gladly answered all of our questions, despite how clueless we all sounded. 

I came with a party of 3 and we ordered a sample platter with beets, chicken, split peas and mixed vegetables with beef. Our meal was served on this spongy bread that you eat with the food and serves as the plate to hold the food. There are a lot of vegetarian options as well. My favorite was the mushed split peas. It looked the least appetizing, but had such unique spices that I was hooked after the first taste. 

I definitely recommend this place if you are an adventurous eater who would like to try something different. I never had Ethiopian food before, but after trying Tana's, I am now a huge fan!"}
{"text":"The injera, tana tibs, beet salad, sambusa, and fossolia were flavorful and well portioned. The vegetable sides were amazing! The lamb was pretty good as well. Friendly service and perfect location in East Liberty. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food. I have to say it was very good. I enjoyed the sampler platter. Got a little bit of everything. I can't even name half if it so I wont try to but all good. Are waitress was very nice and helpful. She told us about all the foods and what was best to pick. I also enjoyed the fact of eating with my hands. Only down side was no Ethiopian desserts. But in the end I enjoyed my meal and feel I would return for another round."}
{"text":"I've been to Tana many times, always enjoyed it. My parents were visiting me and neither of them had ever had Ethiopian food before so I convinced them to give it a try. My Stepdad was super doubtful - he's a meat and potatoes guy - but Mom was keen. She loves cooked vegetables and lentils. She and I got a double vegetarian sampler while my Stepdad got the meat sampler. 

As soon as we start eating, Mom starts making these little exclamations - \"ooh\", \"yum!\", \"Oh my goodness, this is so good!\" I start laughing at her and she's like, \"I'm sorry! It's just all the things I like!\" The rapturous look on her face, it was like she was having a religious experience. Even my Stepdad conceded that the food was good, saying: \"I like that it comes with a lot of bread.\" He loves a good sourdough, so the injera was a hit. 

Thank you Tana for being the absolute highlight of my Mom's visit to Pittsburgh. :)"}
{"text":"What a treat. Highly recommend getting the combo vegetable plate and the combo meat plate. It easily fed 4 of us and didn't break the bank.... $42 total. You get to taste all but 2 of the main dishes that way."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on Yelp before but I had such a crazy experience last night that I felt compelled to create an account, to help save other diners from wasting their time at Tana!

I had a reservation at Tana for 8:30 pm and my husband and I arrived right on time. After checking in, the hostess left us standing at the door for at least 15-20 minutes. 

We were finally seated and looked over the menus when the hostess (who was also our server and the bartender) came back and informed us that the kitchen was \"running out of food\" so we should let her know what items we were interested in and she'd see if there was any left. We gave her our order and she came back a while later and said that they were only out of 1 of the 5 items we wanted, which was fine so we replaced it with something else. 

As our server was about to run off again I asked if we could please order some drinks (we hadn't even been brought water). She said \"yes, of course, but we're out of cups.\" 

Around 9:15 pm our server came by and said our food would be out shortly. A few minutes after that she came back again and said that they were out of injera, and is that alright with us? We said no! The whole point of eating Ethiopian food is that it's served family style on injera, this huge piece of flat bread that you tear off and scoop the food up with, using only your hands and no utensils. Without injera you'd just have some piles of food. Our server was very apologetic and said she'd have the manager come over and talk to us and work something out.

We waited for the manager about 10 minutes and never saw him. During this time we called Abay, another Ethiopian restaurant right around the corner, and made a reservation there. By the time the manager at Tana got to our table we were probably already enjoying our entrees at Abay! 

Abay was also busy that night but they obviously know how to run a restaurant - great food, great prices, and they even had cups!"}
{"text":"You know, the manager was just plain rude to us. Sad really. You'd think you'd want to be kind to your customers."}
{"text":"I tried Tana a few weeks ago and I'm jonesing to go back. We had the Tana sampler and it is definately the way to go if you want a variety of dishes without hurting your wallet. 

The sampler is served on a flat bread that is also your utensil, enjoy eating with your hands.. I did. :)

The toppings can be either meat or vegetable dishes. I recommend the Yesega Wot in Kay Wot sauce. It is only a little spicy but very flavorful. 

One thing is that the server did mess up our order. My wife and I both ordered the sampler, and we did get everything we asked for - but only between the two of us. I had some of her choices on my dish and she had some of mine on hers. 

One particular note: I asked if they had Kitfo on the menu. They don't, but with 24 hours advanced notice they are willing to make it! Next time..."}
{"text":"Waited for 20 minutes on the table with no one taking our order. So had to leave with my date to a nearby restaurant.

The management should hire more servers. They only had one server that was the hostess, the waiter, the bartender, and busser for 30 people.  The menu looks promising but they need people to take the order..."}
{"text":"It was some of the best food I've had in a while, but it seemed like waitstaff didn't have their act together. It was a 30 minute wait to be seated even though only about 75% of the tables were open. We ordered beers but they were out of refrigerated bottles so they brought us warm ones instead of asking if we'd like something else. Then we waited about an hour and a half for the food to arrive. I wasn't in any hurry, but the tables around me all had similar wait times and were pretty unhappy about it. There were two waitress on and it honestly seemed like they could have been cooking the food too for as frantic as they seemed and how long it took to check on us. The food was quite pricy compared to other Ethiopian places I've been. But it was really good and the portions were generous.

I wouldn't go frequently, but it's a good place for special occasions if you want to sit around and chat for an evening and try something different."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why more people don't come here.  It was absolutely delicious.  We got the YeSaga Wot which was absolutely tender and flavorful.  We also had the Tikil Gomen, cabbage and carrots and Fossilia, cabbage and carrots.  However, it was the Shira Wot, ground roasted chickpeas, and Ye Abasha Gomen, collard greens, that really had me.  The shira wot was so meaty and flavorful for a vegetarian dish and these collard greens were so good, I could have eaten a bowl of these alone with rice.  

In addition to the awesome food, the service was great.  Our server was super sweet and really helpful in selecting what to get. I honestly really love this place and crave it all the time now.  So worth the trek out here."}
{"text":"Tana was a really fun experience! (Yes, I will call it an experience!) We were visiting Pittsburgh and were craving something a little different. Ethiopian seemed adventurous enough! 

I'll start with the service- while the waiter seemed a little unkept, he was incredibly helpful, attentive  and friendly! 

We decided that since neither of us has had Ethiopian before, we would get the sampler platters along with two Ethiopian beers. 

The beers were good! I had the st. George, which I really enjoyed. I'm not sure which beer my boyfriend got, but we both agreed that the St. George was the way to go.

The food was awesome, served on (and with) the traditional flat, sour bread, with generous helpings of meat and veggies. I know we got spicy beef, which was my favorite. Lamb and chicken were also served on the bread, and those were tasty as well! My boyfriend actually liked the chicken, doro wot, the best. Overall good experience. I think the next time we go, we would order just the chicken and the beef, as it's cheaper than getting the sampler. I think the sampler was $20 per person, which felt a little pricey to me. 

The only negative was that the restaurant seemed a little lackluster. I felt like they were trying to be fancy.... Kind of? Cloth napkins but there are cheap posters on the wall. I would have liked this place to either clean up their act and be fancy or just commit to being a hole in the wall. Identity crisis aside, this place is A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"The review was good and that's why we visited. But completely disappointed! There was a single waiter that day and I don't know how he was managing, but most of the food came quite late and some items were not warm, if not cold. To ask for an additional item was difficult since the guy will be back only after 10min. The platter I liked and it's a must try if it is warm."}
{"text":"For my wife and two young kids I ordered two combination plates, one with vegetarian, the other with 5 meat options.  This was plenty of food for all of us.  The kids (3 and 6) enjoyed many of the selections and the experience of eating with injera.  The prices are quite reasonable.  I don't usually get off the hook for $40 when taking the family out.  The server was very sweet and the dining room looked terrific.  It is relatively huge for actually.  They also have a full bar (including a darn TV but what are you going to do?)

I think it just comes down to the recipe and whether you like it or not.  I didn't NOT like it because Ethiopian food is terrific and it is hard to have a bad experience at this or any Ethiopian restaurant.  That said in my personal opinion I thought some of the textures and flavors left some room for improvement.  They were probably \"correct\" for an authentic rendering.  Anyway, it's the only one left so you have to eat here and like it!"}
{"text":"Food is great!!! I took one star because there's only one guy working there and he didn't check on us much - it took quite long to get a check and process the payment. But he is nice though."}
{"text":"Yum! I've come here a few times now and it's never disappointed. I've ordered various chicken and lamb entrees, and each one has arrived hot and been flavorful. I like that you can choose your sides from the many vegetarian dishes...it ensures that you never have to try exactly the same thing twice if you don't want to! I'm not a total expert on Ethiopian cuisine, but the food here tastes good and won't make you sick. That's all a good restaurant in a tiny city like this needs. The service is about average as far as speed goes (maybe thirty minutes from when you order your food to when you receive it) and the staff are always friendly and attentive. Their wine and beer selections could use an upgrade, since both times I got wine here it tasted pretty cheap, but the food makes up for that and it is BYOB so you can bring your own."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine and Tana did not disappoint.   I ventured here with 2 co-workers, one of which had been there before.  We were seated immediately and our server explained the menu.   I ordered the honey wine, which was very good, smooth, but not too sweet.  We proceeded to order 3 sampler platters, each containing a sampling of 5 dishes (our choice).  I chose 2 chicken dishes, a gound beef dish, the collard greens and green bean/carrot medley.  I also ordered the Sambusa appetizer, similar to an Indian Samosa, but smaller, but very tasty.  My sampler choices arrived atop and large piece of injera bread for scooping.  I also ordered a side of rice. The injera beneath the sampler offering becomes somewhat soggy which I didn't particularly care for, so I used the surrounding dry injera for scooping and mixed the remaining sampler ingredients with rice and used a spoon to eat with.   I didn't like the oily, messy fingers approach, but it was still a great experience.   Everything was seasoned well and very tasty.  I would return."}
{"text":"I wish I could have reviewed the food, but after being seated for 20 minutes, no staff even asked for our drink order. Of the three Staff we saw at the restaurant, two of them walked past our table probably 10 times, and still, no one asked if we needed anything, had any questions, wanted anything to drink, etc.

The restaurant wasn't very busy, maybe half the tables were seated, and best we could tell almost non of them had food. The table next to us seemed to have ordered food, and overhearing their conversation with the staff, they got the order wrong.

I can't say if the food was any good, but the menu seem lacking compared to our regular Ethiopian restaurant only a block away. Bottom line, no service, inattentive staff. You may have to wait, but if you want a better experience, better service, and actually to eat, go to Abay."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, prompt service, a wonderful meal.  I chose the sampler plate which is a good way to get a nice variety of flavors.  The food came out quite quickly and it was all very good.  I like the decor, which is charming, particularly the tablecloths, which looked hand-made.  The music was great, although perhaps a little too loud.. it put a smile on my face.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. The service is fantastic the food is adorable and servings are more than enough. Our waitress recommended some dishes and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had Ethiopian food and wow, so delicious. Their lamb dish was superb! Since I was a newbie, I let the server decide on my two side dishes and I wasn't disappointed. Cabbage and carrots, and corn. Both were delicious and their house Chardonnay was not bad at all. 

Our server was attentive. I agree that it's not much on atmosphere there, but I was with friends and that wasn't all that important to us, since we were enjoying good food and each others' company. 

I will definitely go back, and consider Tana one of my new favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I love visiting authentic family owned restaurants; it gives a connection between the culture and the food. Tana did just that! The owners/servers were very sweet and attentive (when we could get their attention; we went in during a busy Friday night dinner rush). We started with beef sambusa (warm fried pastry filled with beef and probably the best thing I've ever eaten). We ordered the Tana Sampler for dinner, which is 5 separate entrees served on injera bread, that you eat with other pieces of injera. We ordered the beef tips, lamb tips, spicy doro wot chicken, lentils and shiro wot chickpeas. The 3 meats were very good with different flavors than I'm used to tasting. As a whole, the sampler was cold. I don't know if this is how the food is typically served or if the kitchen was too busy to get the food out at a hotter temperature. But the meal was a total of 25 dollars for two people and we left over stuffed!! Overall the service was friendly but scarce; the food was adventurous and yummy; and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Tana for quite some time and finally had the opportunity prior to attending a Quantum Theatre performance. The restaurant space is simply furnished and comfortable. Service was pretty good considering the rush we were in, though our server did forget to bring out the wine. The prices are on the moderate end but if you come with a group, it'll drop the cost.

We had the doro wot (slow-cooked chicken) and the yesga wot (slow-simmered beef) with four sides, the timatim selata and misir wot (lentils), tikil gomen (cabbage and carrots) and shiro wot (ground garbanzos). Ethiopian food is usually served family style and you eat straight from the plate so if you don't eat meat or beef (like one of my friends), you might want to ask that to be on a separate plate.

The dishes were very tasty and seemed to work together well. The food was mild in terms of heat level and the flavors weren't overpowering. We had ours with rice instead of the injera, which is sortuv like an Indian dosa. I particularly liked the lentils (reminded me of daal) and beef. 

Overall, I was very happy with the meal and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I just moved from Chicago - the land of amazing restaurants. One of our fears about the 'burgh is the lack of great restaurants, however we were pleasantly surprised. I went here for my birthday in June with a large group of friends and we had a fabulous time! Tana staff were very kind and wonderful. The food is truly delicious. And it's an economical! We all left extremely happy and satiated! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ethiopian food is without a doubt one of my favorite ethnic foods and Tana provides delicious options that are truly authentic.  Many of the other reviews mention the slow service which is true but as you begin to talk with the owner / bartender / server / cook (yes when we went he was all of those things) the immediate personal connection you make and the friendly conversation which follows makes the wait bearable.

Tana has replaced Abay in my book as best Ethiopian in the burgh"}
{"text":"Tana was DELICIOUS!! I have never had Ethiopian food before and this was a great first experience. Each meat comes with a main dish and two sampler sizes of vegetarian dishes, all of course served on a piece of injera. All the prices for that hover around $14-15, but you get a lot for the price. I tried the doro wot with two sides, one was lentils and another was ground chickpeas. Everything was delicious, and the ground chickpea dish was my favorite. I also tried the lamb entree with the pea and collard greens side, which were really good too. My dish said it would be spicy, and as someone who LOVES spicy food and can handle a lot, I usually prepare myself for disappointment when restaurants I haven't tried before say a dish is spicy. I couldn't have been more wrong about my assumption, and the meal was perfectly spicy. We also tried the Ethiopian coffee was really was significantly different from the coffee most people are used to so that was a nice unique change. The ambiance was simple and nothing crazy, but this isn't the kind of restaurant you come to for the ambiance...here the main attraction is the food. I left feeling full with leftovers for dinner. Tana did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the veggie sampler plate. Asked waitress to choose her 4 favorite to round out my collards choice. None quite spicy enough so asked for a side of Ethiopian hotsauce still, surprisingly mild but full flavored and delicious."}
{"text":"Just returned from Tana.  I wanted to reiterate my previous review.  The food was great, not as spicy and robust as Abay, but on the other hand, substantially less oily.  In fact, having eaten an many Ethiopian restaurants over the years, I would say it is probably the lightest/least oily that I have had.  Typcially, the injera ends up an spice infused oil sopped sponge.  Here there is virtually no oil soaking the injera at the end."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian in Pittsburgh, hands down. Knocks the stuffing out of most of the Ethiopian restaurants I've been, too, including those in the mighty Washington, DC.

Super friendly service--sometimes they even throw free stuff in my takeout. Fantastic option for vegetarians, and they even have a reasonably priced lunch menu.

Vegetarians, might I recommend a dinner of Ye ater Kik Alicha, Tikil Gomen, Fossolia? You know those meals that are far too much food, but you try to keep eating because it's just too good? Here it is."}
{"text":"Very good. Got the vegetarian sampler but do not remember all of the options we chose. I definitely wanted something spicier but it was a really cool experience!"}
{"text":"I eat here fairly regularly, but by no means am a regular. However, every time I eat here I always come away feeling like I should eat here even more often. 

Here's the deal: 

a) The food here is legit. I shouldn't necessarily know this, but I do. And it is. Just take my word on it.

b) If you've never had Ethiopian food, it's primarily the following: super tasty, well-seasoned meats and legumes served on a plate of Injera, a spongy pancake-like bread. You use the bread to eat the meat and veggies. Very simple and very fun. Plus, the injera that's been sitting under your entrees is the best!

c) If you don't know what to get. Just order one meat entree [for you carnivores out there] and you get two veggie sides. Plenty for one. If you're with a date or a group, just have them combine it on one or two trays. You're going to want to try everything anyway.

The Ethiopian beers are fun to try too. 

Bring friends and experience a tasty gem in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Not the best Ethiopian food I've ever had, but I'm visiting tana at least once a month to get my fill, it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city. As a vegan, I've had almost all the possible vegetarian entrees and the lentil soup and lentil samosas. My favorites would be the cabbage entree and the chickpea one. Expect to pay about $15 per person. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"I do not consider myself an Ethiopian food expert, but I have to say, based on the experiences that I have had in the past both in Pittsburgh and elsewhere, Tana is pretty top notch!  

The food was absolutely tasty... we were with a vegan friend, so we stuck with a Vegetable combo for the 4 of us.  I loved the Tikil gomen and Ye Abesha Gomen.  Soooooo yummy!  

The Blue Nile Ethiopian white wine was yummy too. 

Wednesday nights they seem to have a Jazz band... we were leaving when they were getting started but now I have a reason to go back... and very soon! 

Service was nice and pleasant too... a great experience overall."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome! He made some recommendations and I was happy to have him help me navigate through some Ethiopian cuisine! The lentil soup was a little bland but my entree was pretty delicious! I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: A bright and clean restaurant that's almost a little too spacious. The tables pretty much line the walls and leave large walkways which makes the place seem a little desolate. This was compounded by the fact that the place was empty aside from one other table when my wife and I went. Nonetheless the staff were very friendly and helped make some recommendations for us. Food came out within 10 minutes, again likely since we were the only order for the kitchen.

Food: No idea why this place was empty because the food was awesome. The injera is made with real teff (an issue at cheaper places) and had the appropriate amount of tang to be noticeable but not overpowering. We got the combo platter with YeSega Tibs (Beef), Tana Tibs (Lamb), Doro Wot (Chicken, Hot), Michchet Abish (Ground beef, Hot), and Ye Abesha Gomen (collards). All the meats were moist, tender, and PACKED with flavor. For someone who puts sriracha instead of ketchup on his hotdog, the \"hot\" was mild with the exception of the Minchet Abish which had a moderate heat like that of a serrano pepper. The doro wat comes out with like 2 drum sticks per person and boiled eggs which frequently gets omitted. We were worried we would have to order extra injera as it is not unlimited like other Ethiopian places we've been but it actually ended being the perfect amount once we finish eating the injera the food comes out on.

Overall Tana is an excellent Ethiopian restaurant that serves authentic flavors with authentic ingredients. Food came out fast which is almost unheard of for this genre of food and the prices are reasonable for what you get. I'd highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food because it's tasty and there are many vegetarian options. Tana definitely hits the spot (the veggie sampler is a great value!), but there were a few things that could have been improved.

1. The restaurant seemed kind of messy. Maybe they had just had a party? Either way, the chairs were messed up and there were menus all over the place.

2. Our food arrived cold. I'm pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be cold. 

3. The corkage fee is either $2/person or $10/bottle. Either way that seems exorbitant. Don't BYOB.

Points 1 and 2 could be chalked up to an off-night, so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"To start positive, the food is amazing. If you get a meat entree, you get two vegetable side dishes which is awesome for trying a variety of dishes. The food is so flavorful and delicious. The only thing I don't like is their cold chickpea vegetarian dish. 

Now the restaurant itself doesn't have much atmosphere. Once we sat down it took awhile for someone to come over. Also, we waited a VERY long time for our food. Granted, they said they were backed up so maybe it was just an off night. The waitress was attentive and friendly. 

I would definitely recommend going here, but go for the food not the service."}
{"text":"Tana was my first time eating Ethiopian food. (I felt a little awkward eating with my hands but think that I did it properly. :)) I enjoyed the taste of the various meats and vegetables but felt so-so about the injera. Price was fine. Waitress was nice. It was easy to get a table."}
{"text":"Tana was my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine.  I came here awhile back on a weeknight per the suggestion of my dining companion.  Never having tried Ethiopian food before, I wasn't really sure to expect, but it was a great experience!

We started off with an appetizer that's no longer on the menu, which was a dish commonly eaten for breakfast in Ethiopia, and it was quite tasty.  For our entree, we ordered the Tana sampler with a combination of meat and vegetarian dishes.  If you're new to Ethiopian cuisine, I highly recommend ordering a sampler, since it provides you with an opportunity to try several dishes and see what you like.  Since I don't eat beef or lamb, for our meat dishes, we stuck with the two chicken dishes, doro tibs and doro wat (alicha).  For our vegetable dishes, we ordered misir wat (lentils in berebere sauce), ye abesha gomen (collard greens), and tikil gomen (cabbage/carrots).  All were quite flavorful, though it's difficult for me to recall what my favorites were, since it's been so long.  For the sampler, your dishes are served on fermented bread, and you eat them with your hands by dipping pieces of the bread into them.  This also allows the flavors of the dishes to permeate the bread, so that when you're finished, you can continue to enjoy them by eating the bread that they were served on.  The bread itself, which I'd never had before, was excellent, and accompanied the flavors of the dishes well.

Our waiter was good at explaining the various foods and making recommendations, which I very much appreciated as a newbie to Ethiopian cuisine.  While I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the atmosphere is a bit sterile, it's still not bad, esp. for an eatery located in a basement.  We were seated in a corner table near a window, which helped to dispel that basement feel.  Overall, eating at Tana was a very enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning in the future and sampling Ethiopian cuisine again!  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"My five-year-old loves Ethiopian food, so it's a common choice in our family for eating out. She particularly loves the traditional weaved tables and stools, so we started off usually going Abay, around the corner from Tana, because of these tables right in front. But after three disappointing meals at Abay in a row we made an executive decision to eat at Tana instead. That was a good choice.

The food is delicious. Nothing over-spiced or overly oiled, tender meats, flavorful vegetables. It's also nice to get a beer with the meal-- I've been a fan of the Hakim stout lately. Then there's the owner, a friendly and enthusiastic man who delights in bringing our little girl extra dishes to try (lamb!) and a few cookies after the meal. Other servers we've had there, while less effusive, have been nothing but friendly and helpful.

Tana suffers from a poor location and so is often sparsely populated. That is a shame. It's a great place. If you find yourself waiting for a table at the ever-crowded Abay-- or better yet, before you even go!-- head to Tana. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A fulfilling and a hearty meal! That's what I felt a meal in Tana Ethiopian Cuisine was.

Came here on a Saturday evening and we were immediately seated. The waiter was extremely courteous and very efficient. He asked us if we had been there before, and when the answer was no, he began explaining to us, the concept of ordering food there.

Basically every dish (meat or vegetarian) came with additional 2 side dishes of vegetarian or from a couple of salads which he highlighted. These were smaller portions and accompanies the main bigger sized entree element (meat or vegetarian). Felt this was a nice way to experience a combination of dishes. We could also do the vegetarian or meat sampler, but we refrained from doing so as we wanted a nice combination of both. 

We ordered the Doro Tibs (Chicken) which was basically small pieces of meat in a delicious marinade. We also got the Doro Wot (chicken) with cook with a slightly hot sauce and this was clearly the winner. It came with an egg and a chicken drumstick and the sauce tasted heavenly. From combination of vegetarian sides we ordered, I liked the Misir Wot which is made from split lentils, the best. The Shiro Wot made from ground chickpeas was also delectable. 

Overall loved the food, the service and the concept of eating with hands here. Will totally come back here soon for a meal!"}
{"text":"I am a fairly regular eater of Ethiopian cuisine, and usually have a lot of choices in my hometown. However while I'm here, there is only one choice. The food is nowhere near authentic, but it's enough to satisfy a craving. I've been here in several occasions, and the staff has always been friendly, quick, and attentive. Despite not being a huge fan of the food, I was always willing to return. But no more. 

My waitress was non existent for most of my dining experience, and unpleasant when she was. I tried to order a meat entree with two of the same side (I really like greens)  and she wouldn't let me make that decision. In fact, what I really wanted was a full sized meat portion and a full sized vegetable portion for the leftovers. Instead of being able to convey what I wanted, I was interrupted and pressured into ordering something I didn't want.

The two other tables seated in the restaurant both received their food first, although they were seated after me and larger portions. This always drives me crazy, but I was willing to let that go. 

When my food finally arrived, my waitress set it down and simply walked away. The portions seemed very uneven, and my lentils were cold. But the real issue was that I did not receive injera to eat my meal with. 

After reviewing their menu, it may just be that they do not serve their meals with a spare slice of injera to eat with, although I have been given one every time I've been there. I thought maybe my waitress had just forgotten it, and decided to eat with just what was on the plate, and ask her when she returned. 

That would have been fine, had she not disappeared for twenty minutes. When she did arrive, I did receive injera, finished my meal and paid. 

The kicker-- I was charged for the injera. I have never been charged for it before. At any Ethiopian restaurant. 

I am so unhappy with my service two nights ago that I will not be returning. It's not worth it now that their staff is no longer welcoming and friendly, and certainly isn't worth it for cold vegetables and charges for one piece of injera to be served with your meal."}
{"text":"Great food here! I had the lamb tibs and loved the tibs. The staff here was great as well. I'll definitely comeback"}
{"text":"This was only my second time having Ethiopian food. The first was in Baltimore so I feel like my knowledge is limited.  

Our server was also the cook so we had to catch her whenever she was around. We went without water and napkins for a while waiting for her to come out from the kitchen. 

I ordered the sampler with 3 meats (chicken, lamb and beef) and collard greens and cabbage and carrots. I enjoyed everything except the chicken. It was cold and would of preferred cut up pieces of chicken instead of a drum stick. 

Would go back again to try other things off the menu."}
{"text":"Unique dining experience. This is an excellent addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. The food is also great! The spices take everything to the next level, there's decent sized portions and you'll want to eat it all."}
{"text":"Tana was my first experience with Ethiopian food and I was not disappointed. The restaurant is a quick 7 minute walk from our apartment so I had wanted to check it out for months. Aside from not feeling confident enough to attempt a pronunciation of any of the dishes, I am an adventurous eater and just picked a few and hoped for the best. As a vegetarian, it's always comforting to find an entire section of the menu devoted to meat-free entrees. Suffice it so say, the food is delicious, it's fun to eat with your hands, I have dreams about their injera, and you can gorge yourself on flavorful, healthy food. All good things. Only negatives I could think of are sometimes it takes a little while to get seated or get service, and the restaurant seems a bit sparsely decorated. Highly recommend if your priorities lay with delicious food first and ambiance second."}

{"text":"I stopped by here this past Wednesday night for dinner with my wife.  We were out at something earlier and so arrived to Tana shortly after 8 PM.  Since it was a bit late for dinner I was surprised by the fact that a couple of groups went in right before us.  It was only after the hostess took us to our seats that we saw the band and understood what the late draw was.  The inside of Tana is actually quite spacious with a large bar off to the right whenever you first walk in and then a large dining area just past that.  The walls are decorated with posters that contain scenes and people from what I am guessing is Ethiopia since that was printed largely on the bottom.

This wasn't the first time that my wife and I have eaten Ethiopian food so we knew what to expect.  If you have never eaten it before the food is served on a sourdough flatbread that you break off and use to eat the food.  For my entree I decided to go with the michet abish (beef) in the berbere sauce and then chose the Misir Wot and a chickpea item as my sides which all came on a big piece of injera.  I did really enjoy the beef portion of my dish and that was mostly due to the flavor and spiciness of the berbere sauce.  My lentil side was ok and my chickpea side was not to my liking.  What I really wished would have come with my meal was an extra piece of injera.  Instead it was only offered to us whenever my plate was already 3/4 gone.  My wife also got some beef here but different than what I got.  Whenever I had finished my meal here I looked over to her plate and realized that she had eaten both of her sides but not her main dish.  Upon asking her the problem she stated that it was too salty.  After trying it myself I would have to agree with her.

The bottom line for me is that I may come back here again in the future.  I was honestly pretty excited to be eating Ethipian food again after a couple year hiatus from it.  However, the overwhelming noise from the band (they were good but loud and I didn't expect a band to be at Tana), salty main dish for my wife and lack of injera left a bigger impression in my mind than the good of my main dish and so I don't think I would be as estactic to come back again."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin...our waitress was great, very informative, friendly and patient and very attentive. Her suggestions on menu selections very spot on. We ordered 2 samplers, vegetarian and meat, which gave us 10 selections, which left us with smiles on our faces and full stomachs, and not the gross bloated full either. We didn't venture and try the Ethiopian beers but we sampled the wine, just a bit too sweet for my taste, but still good. It was quite an experience using my hands instead of silverware, but its all part of the experience. Next time I'll try the beers, I will be returning, especially for Wednesday night jazz night."}
{"text":"Ate at Tana recently while traveling through Pittsburgh. Spent the entire meal wondering how we where the only people in the place because the food WAS AWESOME. The service was top notch too. Seriously, a restaurant as good as this should never be empty at 7:30. I have eaten Ethiopian food in NYC and San Francisco and Tana is easily as good. I am happy that we found it on Yelp and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Ethiopian food. We got a sampler and enjoyed everything on it."}
{"text":"Good tasty food but really really really slow service!

There was only one, very enthusiastic waitress who made us feel really at home. She did her best to make up for the slow kitchen. 

The food turned up about a hour after after our order. The sampler was very tasty.

All in all, might be  good place if you aren't very hungry and want to spend time hanging out in the restaurant, say with a bunch of friends!"}
{"text":"If you're an avid fan of Ethiopian and you've been to, say, DC's numerous restaurants, feel free to take my review with a grain of salt. My only experience with Ethiopian cuisine was at Pittsburgh's two (only this one remains) Ethiopian joints, so I'm by no means well-trained in the flavor profiles, BUT I will say that it doesn't take experienced tastebuds to enjoy Tana!

We've tried nearly everything on the menu, except the lamb, and I have to say that I've enjoyed everything. Eating with injera might seem odd at first, but it's a wonderful! For first-timers from Pittsburgh, I always describe injera as the same consistency and texture of a Pamela's pancake without the heaviness. It doesn't have much flavor, so it doesn't take away from all of the flavors of the main dishes.

Speaking of flavor, there's plenty of it! If you're in a big group, the family-style samplers are an excellent option. After numerous trips to Tana, we were recently told by our waiter that we could do a few samplers of meat and a few of vegetables, which lowers the cost per person and allows everyone to try nearly every item on the menu! Perfect for exploring!

The waitstaff is also really nice, and on Thursdays they have live jazz. It definitely gets packed, so I'd make a reservation if you're planning on a Thursday evening around 8. Otherwise, we've never had any issues with getting a seat. Parking it also fairly easy, even on busier nights.

I'd say the only real thing that Tana lacks is atmosphere. Yes, there are the Ethiopian posters and African-inspired color palettes, but something about the atmosphere just feels flat and cold. The back section of the restaurant seems like an afterthought, and when you sit there, you feel like you're stuck in the back of a dark cafeteria.

Overall, Tana is delicious enough to become a mainstay for us, and with a slightly more inviting atmosphere, it would DEFINITELY be a 5-star experience. Great, delicious options for meat lovers and vegans/vegetarians, with fair prices! You really can't go wrong. I'd recommend certain dishes, but honestly, I don't think you can go wrong. I know we haven't! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Being the only Ethiopian restaurant in town, you really don't have a choice but go here if you're in the mood for Ethiopian. 

The spongey bread wasn't what made this a three for me, it was the serving sizes and the somewhat blandish dishes. The service was also pretty slow, but pleasant enough. I got the lamb entree with the two sides and I don't even remember exactly what they tasted like."}
{"text":"Let me start with a disclaimer: I have never eaten Ethiopian food before, but have read about the concepts, history and attributes of the food.  We were out in Pittsburg for the Thanksgiving weekend, and looking for something different to try.  Tana seemed to fit the bill.

The service was friendly, the staff pleasing and very helpful.  The waitress helped explain the foods, and structured a meal for us that would let us try various forms of the cuisine.  The only downside of the service was our waitress/bartender did not know how to fix a Bourbon and Ginger Ale.  We settled on a Jack Daniels and Ginger Ale.  Close enough.

The food was where things began to go down hill.  Ethiopian food has a tradition of being heavily spiced and quite hot.  The food we tried was very mild, and honestly not terribly interesting.  The Injera (Teff flour spongy flat bread) was good, but we found it surprising it was not served warm.  Now it may be that it is usually served cod/cool, but seemed all wrong to those of us used to eating Indian Roti or Naan.

We ordered 2 appetizers.  Sambusa are pastry shells filled with various meats of vegetables.  We had a mix of lentil, beef and chicken fillings.  Expecting something more akin to a Samosa, these were smaller, greasy and tasteless.  The chicken was palatable, the lentils ok, and the beef awful.  Think under seasoned ultra fine ground beef that has been overcooked.  Yuck.  My wife ordered the Ayib Bemitmita (grated cottage cheese and spices), and this was not served until well into the main course, and was boring.

The main course was a sampling of a Doro Tibs (chiken) dish, a Tana Tibs (Lamb) dish, Ye ater Kik Alicha (split peas) and Misir Wot (lentils).  These were served on top of a large serving of Injera.  In order to preference, the split peas were in fact quick enjoyable, the lentils decent by less interesting.  The two meat dishes were, frankly, boring.  No spice, no heat, served cool, and the meat was tough.  A total strike-out in our opinion.

I am sure that Ethiopian food must be much more interesting than this, however, keep in mind that this was our first tasting of this regional cuisine.  I would rate this as 2.5 starts, but given our inexperience, bumped to 3 stars to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"*gluten free injera available if you call 3 days in advance* Food was great. Service is too."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday evening with a very large group of girls!  There weren't many other people in the restaurant.  I felt sort of bummed out for the staff, but our waiter was very pleasant and patient with us nonetheless.  I ordered a glass of honey wine, which was sticky and sweet (in a good way).  

I ordered the vegetarian sampler, with Kay Wot (lentils), Ye ater Kik Alicha (split peas), Tikil Gomen (cabbage and carrots), Ye Abesha Gomen (collard greens), and Shiro Wot (chickpeas).  Everything arrived sort of lukewarm, and most of my dining companions reported the same thing.  I know we were a large party and that makes it hard to get those things right, but it was a little disappointing.  The food was okay, not the best Ethiopian I've had (that would be Ethiopian Diamond in Chicago), the flavors were a little mild - even the \"hot\" items weren't very spicy.  The meal was enjoyable and honestly, lighter than most Ethiopian food I've had.  It didn't feel heavy, greasy, or oily at all.  Still, I would've liked the flavors to have more pizzaz, and the temperatures of the food to be a little higher.  I'd give it another chance though - after I spread the wealth and try Abay.  I thought the price was reasonable for what you get, and parking is easy on the street in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"As an Ethiopian cuisine connoisseur, I can say that Tana makes some excellent food, the Doro Wat is so, so flavorful, as are the other meat options. The injera is not as tangy as other places, but that may be a function of the white people population. It is one of the larger Ethiopian restaurants that I have been to. I definitely appreciated that the staff provided my kid with complimentary bowl of chicken rice without us asking for it. That is fine service!"}
{"text":"We got the tana sampler platter for four people and got a tremendous amount of food. After living in Addis Ababa for four years, the wots were nowhere near as spicy as I would have liked but still pretty yummy. The doro wot (chicken stew) was the best one and the ye sega tibs (beef pieces) were also very delicious. Ye habesha gomen (local/Ethiopian cabbage) was also good but slightly overdone. We were fairly disappointed by the shiro wot (chickpea flour stew) and miser wot (lentil stew) which were not smooth enough or spicy enough. The injera was spot on and the service was pretty good as well. Overall, a pleasant experience but maybe not worth the price. But since it's one of the few Ethiopian places in Pittsburgh, it's a definite place to visit."}
{"text":"I grudgingly went here with my +1 and his (we'll say \"eccentric\") family. It's a cute place, very friendly. A bit empty. 

We all ordered something different, split--it comes on a giant shared platter--what I could decipher, ate all the Sambusa, even had my doro tibs (chicken of some sort) eaten on the injera/flatbread.  I felt a little adventurous, to be honest.  Unfortunately, it was just okay though.
I have never had Ethiopian food before so it is really possible that I just don't REALLY enjoy the cuisine in the same way I would love something more common like Thai or Indian.  I am also very particular.  It's not you, it's me.

I will say I did not dislike anything.  The booze selection was decent, and the plum wine I ordered was awesome.  The staff was great and really helped our little American brains understand what we wanted.  I probably won't go back on my own whim, which I hate since it is a block from home.  But I'm glad it's there.  Even if I am not crazy about it, it does add something to the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the favorites restaurant in Pittsburgh. In my most recent visit there, last week, I was happy that not only was the food awesome as always but the service was really good!  Their bread injera is gluten free and this is such awesome cuisine for vegetarians.  I can't wait to go back again very soon!!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian plate and the servers are very friendly. This is a place to enjoy when you have a little leisure time as it takes a little time. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We went on a Sunday evening, there was no wait at all. My wife had the lamb with the tamarind sauce, I got the chicken.

Every side and both the entrees had great flavor and were well prepared. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tana's is a must stop in Pittsburgh for anyone who considers him or herself to be an adventurous eater. When ordering an entree, you choose a menu course and then choose two sides from select appetizers and vegetarian entrees. This allows customers to try a wider array of food. (On a side note, Tana's also has samplers which lets patrons try even more dishes). The food is served on top of Ethiopian bread called injera and without utensils. Basically, you use the bread to pick up the food with your hands which is not a common practice in the US. I really liked the approach of using everything in front of you and optimally using your resources.

I ordered the Misir Wot with beets salad and split peas. I enjoyed all three items and would recommend each. My dinner patrons also finished most of their plates and enjoyed their respective items.

As a bonus, we came on Sunday which offers an extra 15% off for Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I lived in Ethiopia for three years and am a huge fan of Ethiopian food. The food authenticity here is on point but the variety is lacking, there are so many other dishes that should be available! I'm missing Fir fir and Tagabino, however it may be that the owners are from different area of the country and do not make these dishes. 
Anyways, the news is always on the TV very loud and there is only occasionally Ethiopian music playing. The service is INCREDIBLY slow. We were one of two tables but it took forever to get a drink. I'm a server myself and am exceedingly patient, but this was too much. They were very nice and polite but were not knowledgeable at all about Ethiopian food (most of the servers are not Ethiopian). It just seems like a lot more effort could be put on making it a more culturally accurate setting and service. I really like this place so much and will definitely be back because I want it to do well! The food is fantastic, just don't go if you're in a hurry.

Hoping the best!"}
{"text":"When people find out that I love food, a common question they normally ask is, \"What is your favorite kind of food?\"  However, I always find myself unable to answer that question.  In all honestly, my favorite type of food is different food.  What I mean is I love experiencing new types of food.  Trying different new and exotic cuisines is one of my favorite activities, and just the other day, my mother and I ventured into East Liberty for a first-time tasting of Ethiopian cuisine.  

While walking into Tana Ethiopian Cuisine, I felt myself experiencing a feeling of uncertainty.  Usually before going to a restaurant, I visit the restaurant's website, become acquainted with the menu, and decide what I am going to order.  However, I found myself totally overwhelmed by foods and ingredients I had never before seen after looking over the menu.  I was walking into this dining experience completely blind, and truth be told, I was nervous.  Luckily for my mother and me, our waiter was one of the friendly and most helpful servers we have ever had.  He walked us through every item on the menu.  Though there were over fifty menu items, he explained what each dish contained and how it tasted.  After his much needed help, we finally decided on an order of Doro Tibs and Yesga Wot.  For the people who do not speak Amharic, Doro Tibs are pieces of chicken breast marinated in a blend of spices, and Yesga Wot are slices of beef stewed in a sauce of the customer's choice.  Today, my mother and I were feeling adventurous, so we decided on the hot and spicy Berbere Sauce.  The only thing left to do now was wait for our feast to arrive.

At this point, I want to make it clear that this meal was fresh and served to order.  In fact, the waiter who took our order also doubled as the head chief.  It may sound cheesy, but I felt that Tana did an excellent job creating an intimate and personal dining experience.  Atmosphere is an important aspect to consider when judging a dining experience.  In my opinion, a bad personal experience can easily jeopardize my desire to want to return for a second meal.  Though the quality of food is vital, it is not the only point that is taken into consideration when deciding where to dine.  Speaking of food, let us bring our attention back to the meal.

As the waiter set the gigantic rounded plate down, I noticed that there were neither forks nor spoons on the table.  That is when the cheerful, young waiter laughed and instructed us that Ethiopians eat with their hands.  I will try to explain it the best that I can.  All of the food that one orders off of the menu comes piled upon a flat, circular bed of spongy bread called Injera.  One then uses his or her hands to tear off a piece of Injera which is then used as a grappling apparatus.  I love eating with my hands, so this exotic method of eating instantly turned me into a fan of Ethiopian cuisine.  There was honestly not one bad tasting item on this bed of bread.  The side dishes of green beans and cabbage also had their own interestingly tangy flavor.  They were fantastic.  My mother fell in love with the spicy beef, and I also have to admit that I have never had beef that was seasoned so perfectly.  The Berbere sauce added a spicy yet tangy aspect to the dish that left my tongue wanting more.  Also, my fingers found their way to the chicken almost immediately after the plate was set down.  The chicken breast was cooked in a thick yellow sauce that reminded me of an Indian-style curry, but I cannot find words to describe the flavor of the sauce because it was unlike anything I have ever tried before.  Finally, while we were busy eating, something magical happened with the Injera bread.  All of the delicious and flavorful sauces from the meats and vegetables became absorbed by the spongy flatbread.  Eating the deliciously soaked bread was my favorite part of the meal.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.

The world's many cultures offer a vast variety of different types of food, and I want to try them all.  After having an excellent meal at Tana, I can successfully cross Ethiopian food off of my global gastronomy list.  If you have never tried food from this region of the world, I highly suggest you venture out of your usual dining locations and go to Tana.  Finally, if you are disgusted by the idea of eating food with your fingers, bring a knife and fork because you will not find a single utensil on the table."}
{"text":"Tana was our first Ethiopian experience and it was nothing short of amazing. Since we wanted to try everything on the menu, our best option was ordering both the Tana and Vegetarian sample platters. This allowed us to try a little bit of everything which was perfect...and very delicious!  We ordered items 13-15 (lamb, chicken, beef) and veggie items 17-23. The lamb, shiro wat, and fossolia were our favorites, aside from the authentic Ethiopian coffee we had after our meal. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The music is great and so are the waiters. I can't wait for the food to come out! :)"}
{"text":"Ok, admittedly not a lot of Ethiopian in the Burgh to compare to. But I grew up in the Washington DC area, which did have a lot of Ethiopian. Tana is excellent. Not quite as good as the best in DC, the Red Sea, but very very good. Savory and spicy, all the right textures. The injera was actually better than some I've had before. Prompt friendly service and prices reasonable. Will definitely return! A great new addition to the international food scene."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal.  The food was delicious and we had great service.  We found plenty of on street parking.  We dined at an off hour and they still had plenty of tables filled.  It is great that the locals enjoy the food."}
{"text":"A little expensive and wish they would just make the injeera including instead of having to pay. You're already putting a pretty penny for the meal. Every other Ethiopian place I e been too just brings it out constantly. Food great just pricey"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The WORST Ethiopian food we have eaten anywhere ever. Came to pittsburgh on vacation and ordered the veg sampler. Everything was too oily and lacked flavor. But the worst part was the injera - unfermented! It tasted like a raw tortilla. When we sent the food back, we were surprised to still be charged a portion of the bill. At least the server was kind. 

People of pittsburgh, do not be fooled by this place! Once you have tasted real Ethiopian cuisine, you will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Note: According to their website, there is at 2.5 hour gap between lunch and dinner occurring from 2:30 to 5PM.

Kay was really wanting to try some Ethiopian cuisine as was I. Originally our plan was to go to Abay, but once we found a parking spot, we discovered Tana, which is right around the block from Abay, wasn't nearly as busy, and was closer to where we parked the car. So to Tana we headed. 

The reviews seem to be mixed. On our end, however, we were really left with no gripes about the food or the service, but bear in mind that this was our first brush with Ethiopian fare. Having said that, I was somewhat reminded of Indian food based on what we ordered.

Our starter was the Sambusa, which immediately recalled a certain Indian appetizer I've had numerous times. We got ours filled with ground beef (other choices include chicken or vegetables) and found that it managed a fine balancing act between savory and delicate, making for a strong opener. 

For the entree I chose a meat entree called Tana Tibs, which consisted of sauteed lamb, onions, peppers, garlic, rosemary, and  something they refer to as Awaze, all on a bed of injera (Nan's Ethiopian counterpart) with two vegetarian sides (offered with every entree) in Tikil Gomen and Azifa. Again, maybe I don't know what \"good\" Ethiopian food is, but to me everything was outstanding.

It amazes me how good, good food is good, good food no matter where your dart lands on the globe. Equally amazing was how everything overlapped. Great cooks thinking alike? The Tini Tibs invoked Lamb Curry. The Tikil Gomen came off like Halusky sans the noodles. The Azifa, a cold lentil salad, could have been some obscure Mediterranean or Arabic dish had I eaten blindly.

One has to wonder just who influenced who? Africa has been considered the birthplace of civilization. Could the continent be the fount of all the world's eats as well? This meal was as educational as it was mouthwatering, not to mention pungent. I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers who complained about a lack of flavor. All of the entrees put in front of us were permeated with the same vinegary zest that was synchronously familiar yet wondrously peregrine. 

The injera alone was engrossing. A spongy towel of a bread, eating with it took some getting used to, and I'm not sure I mastered it. Yet I dared not ask for utensils. Kay seemed to have an easier time than I did. Our lovely server was kind enough to bring out more of it for us since I used most of it up early. The food was served atop the injera, making it sopping and fragile in parts. Kay's roll-and-eat-like-a-tortilla technique seemed to work for her. I just pulled off pieces of the injera and used them to pick up my food, semi-gracefully I might add. 

Kay had the Doro Wot in the (don't laugh) Kay Wot in Berbere Sauce with Ye Abesha Gomen. I forgot the other vegetarian dish she got. 

The Doro Wot included a chicken leg and a hard boiled egg (!). Once again, I had to step in to help her finish, but  the dish was so palatable that I didn't mind acting as her human garbage disposal. 

Dessert-wise, they only offer Baklava, Carrot Cake, and Chocolate Cake. I know, not very Ethiopian. We shared a huge wedge of the Chocolate Cake, which came from elsewhere. 

Although Abay is getting all the accolades, I'm glad we came to Tana instead, and I hope both of them stay around to duel it out in the same neighborhood for many years to come. My money's on the quieter, more intimate underdog."}
{"text":"Love trying some of the ethnic restaurants.  Tana Ethiopian provides Ethopian cuisine and it is designed for sharing.  Quite a change from the old Sliberty that was mostly Italian.  The space is large but we were given a table by the window, so it seemed smaller.   It also was sparsely seated, but it was a Tuesday, so probably a slow night.  The room temperature was almost cold.  

Though the food is made for sharing but there were only 2 of us so did not have much opportunity.  Had the Minchet Abish Alicha Wot, a ground beef cooked in a sauce that was suppose to be hot.  While Ethiopian food is suppose to be spicy, I found this to be mild not hot.  The hot tea with spices was spicy and very enjoyable.

Will have to come back with a group so we can sample more of the food!"}
{"text":"Rounding up from 3.5 stars.

Charming place with reasonably priced menu offering generous portions of flavorful foods. Vegans and those with allergies will do well here. Food is flavorful and some, especially the Berbere, can be spicy so you may want to discuss with the server.

Giving this 3.5 rather 4 stars because the single waitress was overwhelmed for a restaurant this size, but I would certainly return here as the food was very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, and we were the only people there for at least 30 minutes. The staff was really nice, and the decor was simple. We'd never tried Ethiopian food, so we ordered the Tana sampler with doro wat chicken, yesega tibs beef, tana tibs lamb, fossolia, and misir wot. It was amazing! The food came out on a huge platter with injera, and it was too much food for the both of us. We also tried the sambusa appetizer, and the coffee. I recommend everything I ordered, and am very excited to come back the next time we're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I brought a colleague here to introduce her to Ethiopian food.  I'd never been, but I'd heard good things and decided to see for myself.

The good: Well, the food! We split a sampler and ordered 2 veggie dishes as well as 3 meat dishes.  I found them all to be well seasoned, especially the lamb and the collard greens.  It absolutely does not come out piping hot, but you do eat it with your hands so that'd probably be dangerous.  The server was also kind and did his best to be helpful. The restaurant was also clean and I liked the variety of Ethiopian beers and wines.

The no-so-good: The service isn't as attentive as you'd find at most similarly priced restaurants.  I do think it may be a cultural difference, but as I said, the staff is very nice.  You will probably have to flag them down for drink refills, but they are quick to help once you've gotten their attention.  I also didn't enjoy that the beer was barely cool, but that is definitely cultural (most other countries don't believe in ice cold drinks like we do).

Its a great spot to bring your vegetarian and vegan friends to, as they can order their own food that will be equally flavorful and tasty. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian fare! Wasn't sure what to expect! Went on a Sunday night, only a few other tables in there. The interior itself was pretty basic/bare. 

We each ordered the vegetarian sampler ($14.50/person) and our waitress didn't tell us what was what. She did not explain anything to us but was friendly enough. 
I liked the collard greens, carrots/cabbage, and one of the chickpea dishes.  
Did not like the cold split peas or the dish that resembled applesauce. The bread that we ate with was good but has a strange texture! I enjoyed trying all of these items!

I would definitely try this place again and see if they had any spicier dishes (nothing in our sampler was spicy). I also want to try the beer that I read people review on here."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend.  We were just looking to try something different to try. Well, i was looking for something different, and he is a good sport!  I had read about this place awhile ago, and heard the doors were closing at the end of the month.  It was time to get out and try it. 

We went Friday night a little early (around 6ish). The place was busy, but not packed. We ordered the alitcha wat, gomen besiga, doro wat, and shiro wat.  Based on other reviews we ordered a side of injera.  The whole experience was new to me.  The food is wonderfully spiced. The smells are delicious.  It's also BYOB With a low corkage fee. The overall ambiance was nice. 

The shiro wat was by far my favorite. A little spicy, and completely delicious.  The flavors of the doro wat were great, but every time we went to take a bite somehow we ended up with a bone.   The alitcha way and gomen besiga were ok. Nothing stood out there.  I liked the injera, but my boyfriend didn't really enjoy the taste or the feel of the bread.  

Overall, eating without utensils, was not something I was a huge fan of, and don't get me wrong, I have no probably eating with my hands.  There was just something about this type of food, and eating with my hands that was somewhat unappetizing.  Maybe the visual of everyone around me didn't help.  Regardless, taste trumps everything else, and it was not quite there for me.   I think I should have stuck to the vegetarian entrees."}
{"text":"WHY IS THIS PLACE NOT MORE POPULAR??!

I had never been here, and the server was really great and explained the items really well.  The only reason I gave a four star review and not a five was the samosas.  They were pretty greasy and not very good in general.  

Other than that, everything was so damn good.  Since I eat the equivalent of a family of three in one sitting, I went for the veggie platter.  Five delicious dishes and I couldn't be happier. 

OBNOXIOUS VEGANS OF THE WORL REJOICE!!  All of their vegetarian dishes are vegan.  

Don't shy away because you're unfamiliar with Ethiopian food.   Come here.  Ask questions.  Shove your face with delightful foods."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Tana.

The food is absolutely delicious. I especially love the vegetarian dishes. (Fasolia and lentils are my favorite.) 

The first few times we visited Tana the service was a little slow, but that has definitely changed. Most recently, our server was super attentive and friendly. 

One of my favorite things about Tana is that owner is such a kind and friendly man. He always says hello and has a welcoming smile. 

The next time you are looking to try something new, give Tana a chance!"}
{"text":"Amazing cuisine, I ate ethiopian cuisine for the first time. Really enjoyed food at this place."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this restaurant by some friends last night! 

They suggested that we order a Tana Sampler which would give us a chance to taste many different dishes that they offer. 

What I had was the Tana sampler with: 
Tana Tibs (lamb) 
Doro Wot (Chicken leg) in the Kay Wot sauce
Yesega Wot (beef) in the Kay Wot sauce
Tikil Gomen (cabbage and carrots) 
Ye Abesha Gomen (collard greens) 
Fossolia (green beans and carrots) 
Injera (Flat spongy bread that the food is served on, the tana sampler also comes with extra on the side) 

You will notice that I mention 6 dishes instead of five.  This is because they originally gave me the green beans and not the collard greens, but this was rectified immediately with him bringing out a side dish of the collard greens without a charge.

All of the food is eaten with the aid of the injera (much like a tortilla and Mexican food), though utensils can be requested.

I was particularly impressed by the stewed meats more than the vegetables (personal preference I am not a huge fan of stewed vegetables) and found the injera to be a good foil to the heavy flavors and sauces.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food -- I used to eat it virtually every other week when I lived in the Bay Area. That said, I was thrilled to learn that Pittsburgh has an Ethiopian restaurant. After eating there, though, I wish that there were other options, because this one is terrible. I've given it two chances, but I'm done with it now.

Both times, there was only one waitress who had to deal with way too many tables, and the food took way too long to come out. Our entrees took over 40 minutes to come out.

The sambusas are small, way too oily, and flavorless, and the waitress kept mixing up the lentil and meat ones. I asked for lentil ones, but got meat ones, twice. This was because another table had ordered meat ones, and they kept getting our lentil ones. I don't blame the waitress -- the kitchen needs to get their sambusa system sorted out! Also, worst sambusas I've ever had, definitely not worth the cost.

The prices don't make sense. If you've ever been to an Ethiopian restaurant, you know that whatever you order should come with injera. We got a vegetarian combo, but the waitress said that you had to order the injera extra. The injera was dry and had a weird aftertaste. We also ordered the spiced cottage cheese, which was $4.50 for a tiny bowl. In the Bay Area, this would have also been free. 

The homemade vegetable soup was basically just a small bowl of onion soup, and it also lacked flavor. 

My husband and I both left feeling very dissatisfied.

I hope that someone else opens a better Ethiopian restaurant. This place needs some competition, and I need a new place to get my Ethiopian fix."}
{"text":"There's not much to be said overall.

We ordered two combination dinners so we could try almost all of their entrees.  Flavor's were bland.  Some of the food was lukewarm.  I hate to do direct restaurant comparisons, but Abay serves more flavorful heated food and is also like a buck or two cheaper.

Pro's?  You won't have a hard time trying to get a table here."}
{"text":"I had Ethiopian cuisine in DC and I really enjoyed the shiro. When I searched for Ethiopian restaurants in Pittsburgh, Tana was the only option that popped up on my screen. I came here with a friend - who was having Ethiopian food for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. However, I was disappointed. Compared to the food I had at the other Ethiopian restaurant, Tana's food did not stand out. 

We ordered Doro wot chicken (spicy version) along with lentils and shiro samplers. The first service came in cold. But, the staff was very nice about it and brought us a hot meal the second time. I found the food salty and the lentils were cold the second time too. 

Overall, they have good service. If the food comes in cold, ask for a hot meal."}
