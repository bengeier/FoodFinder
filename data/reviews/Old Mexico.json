{"text":"Old Mexico in Century 3 Mall isn't pushing the envelope of Mexican cuisine.  Nor is it introducing North America to the multitude of diverse esoteric delicacies of Mexican regional cooking.  Then again, it never claimed any of those things.  If you put those expectations aside, and aim your sites for Coronas and taco/burrito platters with the ubiquitous rice and re-fried beans, Old Mexico will deliver a satisfactory experience.

As a denizen of the South Hills/Mon Valley, Old Mexico has been my go to place when I have a hankering for Mexican food.  Yes, I have had better and more authentic.  But, it is convenient for me, and I have yet to have an unsatisfactory experience there.

The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.  I have ordered the various incarnations of the combo platters, fajitas, etc.  The meat, fish, and veggies all seemed to be reasonably fresh.  The guacamole is acceptable.  Yes, the food tends to be on the bland side, but I think they are trying to find a reasonable balance as to accommodate those who don't like the bang and zest of spicy Mexican food, and going too conservative.  I would think that the kitchen would be willing to accommodate if you request the food to be spicier.  The service was friendly and attentive.

Old Mexico isn't a destination restaurant for those outside of the South Hills/Mon Valley.  But, if you happen to be in the area and the mood for Mexican strikes, I think Old Mexico will satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"My trip to Old Mexico was, to say the least, unique.  I am not sure exactly how to describe the ups and downs so I will take this step by step from the time I walked in the door.  Here is my candid review as best as I can explain:

At 11:50 a.m. I walk into Old Mexico which is located in a corner of the ghost town formerly known as Century III mall.  As I walk in I remember the days when the shopping mall actually had open stores, lots of customers, crowded parking lots, and a time when Old Mexico was Ruby Tuesday (which is a really, really good mall restaurant for those who are near one).  As I enter inside I immediately recognize the old Ruby Tuesday dark wood and restaurant set up but its now covered up with what I describe as a Mexican teenager's 10th grade party decorations.  Typical faux Mexican decorations trying to fool los gringos into believing they are in an authentic Mexican restaurant.  OK, I've seen this many times before all over the mid-Atlantic and east coast and still found places which I'd gladly return ... hoping this is one of them.  
I am greeted by an employee who appeared smarmy, with greasy hair, dirty nails and a stained shirt.  He was a friendly person, however, and seated me at a table very near the bar since I was the ONLY patron. It is a Friday at almost noon just to be clear.  After being seated I waited about five minutes for my server. When he arrives he brings me the typical warmed, bag tortilla chips and salsa de mesa along with a menu.  I sampled the chips with the salsa.  The salsa was very fresh and pretty good but definitely catering to the American palate as it was pretty mild.  I order only water to drink, the server leaves then brings it right back to me.  It was a glass the size of a gallon jug, it was huge.
I open the menu and begin to read what I consider a cross between a bad version of an American restaurant on Cinco de Mayo and a typical American restaurant in Texas with a few authentic Mexican dishes.  I read the menu three times before deciding that I will go with one of the dishes I used to judge all real Mexican restaurants, their enchiladas with salsa verde along with a flauta and a tamal.  When the server returns to my table I ask him if there is anything he would recommend as their specialties or best prepared dish.  The server stated he thought I would like lunch combo #1.  Seriously?  With all the food that could be recommended, knowing what I look and sound like, he gives me lunch #1?  So, I ask him if they make their tamales in house.  The server looks puzzled and responds with a very uncertain yes.  I didn't believe him.  Nevertheless I ordered ONE tamel.  The server, who earlier in our conversation stated he was originally from Mexico City, asked to confirm I wanted only one tamale .... I corrected him as there is no such thing as a tamale .... I kindly responded one tamal.  Now my fake Mexican food meter is jacked wayyyy up. Really, who is this guy and where is he really from?  Next, I ask if the flautas are freshly made.  I get a resounding yes from the server.  So, I ordered one flauta as well.  
I waited about fifteen minutes for my food to be served, pretty darn quick turnaround.  The tamal was dry, not terribly dry but it wasn't what I am used to though it was not bad at all.  I would order it again if someone I was with wanted them but I think it was premade somewhere, possibly in house, but heated up in a microwave.  After all, lets face it folks, for those who know, tamales aren't something that Mexicans eat everyday unless its someone's birthday or a special holiday. Now, the flauta.  This is something that I love to eat and was excited to order. The flauta was hot, fresh and served on a slight bed of shredded lettuce with legitimate guacamole.  The flauta was very, very, very good and the guacamole on top was delicious and authentic ... creamy mashed avocado, salt and lime juice (typically guacamole is an accompaniment in central and south Mexico but its considered more of a dip in northern Mexico due to Texas influence).  So far so good, right?  Next came the enchiladas.  Ugh, eek, yuck, blah!!!  This restaurant, with everyone speaking English using a Mexican accent, brings me three mushy, soft enchiladas with salsa colorado ... red sauce.  Little red sauce.  But, to cover up the overcooked vile mush they covered my enchiladas with some type of melted cheese ... abundant amounts of cheese (at least it was white - probably white chedder or maybe asiago) and damp roughly shredded lettuce .... the lettuce was wilted and disgusting.  These were absolutely AWFUL!!!  I ate part of one enchilada and had to stop because they were such a horrible trainwreck.  Possibly the worst I've ever had at a restaurant claiming to be Mexican, including Taco Bell.  
I pay the server my bill and leave knowing that I will not return again unless I hear better things in the future.... from many sources.  Recommendation:  No way Jose."}
{"text":"I would have given no stars, but the waitress was very nice and food came promptly. BUT this place is by far the WORST \"Mexican food\" I have ever eaten! Granted I came from NY where almost every cuisine is yummy, but damn. Absolutely no flavor to anything. Even my margarita was watered down. I got huevos rancheros... It was just fried egg with plain fried rice and refried beans. Awful, no cheese, no pico, no salsa, no guac, no black beans and NO TORTILLA! How do they even serve such garbage. I will never return. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican good. Not Americanized at all. Hard to find these around here. They are only about 1 &1/2 months new and trying to get the word out. I will bring my wife here for sure"}
{"text":"Didn't like the food at all, should have listened to the reviews, but was having major craving for authentic Mexican food and thought maybe it was just an off meal here or there, with the bad reviews. There was 5 of us and out of all 5 of us, only one said their meal was ok, not horrible. The food was very bland no flavor not a good experience. Chipotle has more authentic tasting Mexican food, and better food, then this place."}
{"text":"I went to Old Mexico at Century 3 mall with my girlfriend for Cinco De Mayo. It was our first time there. The food is the typical Mexican that you'd find at places like El Campesino. The place was extremely busy due to it being Cinco. I ordered the enchilada, taco and chile relleno meal. It comes with beans and rice. They did screw up my order though, I ordered the chicken enchilada and got beef instead. Another odd occurrence was that the food came out lukewarm. I'm used to the piping hot plates that come out at most Mexican places. My girlfriend ended up getting the chicken quesadilla which was good. Their white queso cheese is outstanding and a bit spicy. The guacamole was not very good at all, it had an off taste to it. The salsa was great though with tasty tortilla chips. The margaritas were excellent. Overall the food was pretty good, slightly below the quality you'd get at El Camp. Service was efficient, no complaints. All in all, we'd go back to Old Mexico for another try, probably after they move up the road to their new location since Century 3 mall is a dead zone."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, Chinese, Thai and Mexican restaurants are sort of go to places. So I wanted to like this place, but ... 

A number of the employees of this place appeared to be Latino, so I t could have some hope. I will say the dish I had fit the (perhaps old) Pittsburgh ideal of large portions. But the food was only so so. Maybe carnivores (no offense) will find something to like, but I doubt it. Could this place be authentic and I don't know it. Sure, but then to me authenticity would be something to avoid. I went a few weeks ago, and the restaurant was still renovating from the previous tenant. I don't know how far they will bother to go, but I will say the TV's were showing Spanish language shows. 

Oh, and I was there in the middle of a Saturday, and it is a mall, so there was at least one screaming infant (and apparently brain dead parents)."}
{"text":"The service was good. The employees friendly. The food, however, is void of any taste. It lacked any hint of flavor to the point I was concerned about what I was actually eating. Forced down about 1/3 of the platter and cashed out. Too bad, the area needs a good Mexican restaurant. Maybe they can get a new chef?"}
{"text":"I ordered the Vegetarian Plate. t was the most processed-looking plate of food I've had set before me in quite a while. The cheese, which covered half of the plate, was very sweet, creamy and rich. The first couple bites were OK, but after that it was just too much so most went uneaten as it wasn't worth taking home. A corn tortilla was served that was piled high with iceberg lettuce and a few diced tomatoes. Bland yet overly sweet is the best I can say about it all. 

My glass of water remained empty for 20 minutes before I finally flagged down the waiter, who spent most of the time chatting with a fellow waiter down by the bar. The place was practically deserted the entire time and he was certainly not busy with work - he was simply not doing his job and consequently demonstrated disrespect to the customers.

I had reservations about eating there and told myself that maybe it was a family-owned business taking advantage of the purportedly cheap rents at the mall. But after experiencing such uninspired food and careless service I'm sure it must be a faltering corporate/franchise outfit."}
{"text":"Our first time at Old Mexico in a rather vacant Century III Mall. A good initial sign was that the restaurant had a good amount of diners. The clientele however was mostly older couples and families, so not such a good sign. Ha.
And yes we fit into that demographic.

We were served a complimentary basket of warmed tortilla chips with 2 very small bowls of salsa, one spicy, one mild. The chips and the spicy salsa were very good. No free refills on the chips and salsa.

I ordered chicken fajitas which came on a sizzling hot cast iron plate. Hubby ordered chicken quesadillas. The servings were very generous. My fajitas were very good. Hubby's quesadillas were also good. But the entree didn't look as impressive as the sizzling fajitas. Mainly the quesadillas were cut into triangles and arranged around a scoop of sour cream and chopped lettuce and tomatoes.

The furnishings were a bit run down and sticky.  At least my chair back was sticky. The sun came through the window showing greasy rag smears on the wall. The upholstery on the booth seats was torn. Neither of us checked out the rest rooms.

Overall, we might return to give it a second chance. But we would probably not take guests.

I'm giving 3 stars - if you are hungry for Mexican food you will leave with a full belly."}
{"text":"Excellent service, polite and efficient wait staff. Wonderful frozen margaritas! The fajitas are delicious! Highly recommend this mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the best chicken and steak fajitas.  The steak was delicious!  The only thing was my guac salad was a little skimpy.  Other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price! it really is authentic Mexican food, not overly spiced or Americanized. The first time we sent it was packed, the second time we went it was packed, the third time I place an order for take out and had a delicious margarita while I waited. Great Mexican food in Pittsburgh, just try it out!"}
{"text":"Old Mexico has easily become a favorite restaurant! The enchilada's are absolutely amazing! The first day I went here was on Cinco De Mayo and the place was decorated so nice. I had to get a  frozen margarita, I got a small one..and it was huge..the biggest is just extremely huge lol. My margarita was very good, a little too strong, but I'm a wimp when it comes to alcohol. The portions are very large! I've gone their twice now and their is always someone to greet you nicely and seat you quickly. The service is great and prompt..everyone that works their is super friendly. I'm surprised by some reviews...I think Old Mexico restaurant is awesome and a actual nice add to the crappy century three mall!"}
{"text":"The food is delectable, and great service! Also very glad they're moving out of that dying mall! I eat here almost every Wednesday on my day off! Keep up the great work! They make a mean chimichanga!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with authentic Mexican cuisine. Reminds me of chi-chi's. Also the price for lunch is really good. Dinner prices are alittle high but good food for the money."}
{"text":"10 out of 10 would date again. 

The same Old Mexico at a new location. 
\" New Mexico, who dis? \" 

Do you like margs? If you answered no then you should probably look for something other then Mexican because Old Mexico's Margs will have you saying \"esto es mejor que el sexo!\""}
{"text":"Very bland disappointing chiles rellenos. They didn't use green poblano peppers, but they were some kind of sweet red peppers. No flavor, just bland! And there was too much flavorless white cheese over everything. I wish my platter had tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, SOMETHING colorful.

Same situation with the tamales. Not bad---not great. Just bland. Two of my very FAVORITE dishes, that just made me go, \"Meh...\"

The tables could have been swept beneath (made me wonder about food safety standards) and it was NOT crowded (New Year's Eve) and they seated our party of 3 right by the opening outside door. It was 5° tonight! I put my jacket back on to sit at the table and talk, and my food got COLD fast!!! I don't want to be unkind, but I would not go back. I paid over $20 for my food and (1) margarita plus $5 tip, but I would never go back. There are so many better options."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, now.  Service is friendly and quick.  Chips and salsa are standard and filling, though I'm fairly certain the guacamole is not freshly made.  I ordered a chile relleno plate on my first visit. Now, I love cheese, but this was 90% cheese with some bits of ?ground beef and strips of poblano pepper.  I couldn't finish it because it was too rich.  The refried beans and rice are standard and filling.  The second time, I got the carne asada and couldn't finish it because the steak had an off taste about it--and not the seasoning, but more that it may not have been \"fresh\".  In all fairness, I should have told the waiter, but my husband was done eating and I didn't want to wait for another meal.  In our two visits, most of the waitstaff have clustered around at the far end of the restaurant in open view, talking rather than tending to the tables. The high chair didn't come with belts, nor did the booster seats.  Having a booth that's elevated didn't work well with a high chair since the table is higher up than the chair, so we opted for  booster, which we couldn't restrain our toddler since there wasn't a belt and she kept sliding under the edge of the table.  We haven't been back since our last visit, and so we'll do so at our own risk."}
{"text":"Old Mexico is one of my favorite places to eat when it comes to authentic Mexican food. I have had the fajitas which are excellent. I've also had the roasted poblano peppers which is one of my favorite dishes along with other various dishes. You have got to try it out for yourself. The portions are well worth the money and the service has never let us down. I recommend this place to anyone and put it up against any rival Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Real mexican food, with real mexican employees... outstanding margarita specials also."}
{"text":"Hidden in the back of the nearly abandoned Century 3 mall is Old Mexico. I wanna say this is soon to change and they're moving to another location on Route 51, but I'm not 100% certain. Anyhow, like most other Mexican restaurants, Old Mexico's menu is extremely varied and you have a ton to choose from. I came here on a Wednesday night and while I thought it was going to be completely dead, that wasn't the case at all. I'm glad they're still getting decent business despite the hidden location. I ordered a combination plate that had a taco, enchilada, and chile relleno. Each table also gets a complementary basket of chips and two types of red salsa. The food was well prepared and flavors were nice, yet a little mild for my taste as I'm a lover of spice! We also had great, very attentive service from our waiter. Overall a positive experience and I would come back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Ordered Tacos and they had no flavor and the ground meat looked questionable. Woke up at 2am with stomach cramps etc."}
{"text":"Had a decent dinner, nothing spectacular but good Mexican comfort food. The portions are quite ample, the service is a bit spotty ... But it was  busy, so maybe the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed. The wait staff is very, very nice, but the English/Spanish translations can be a bit tricky. Will definitely go back again, love Mexican food and it is rare  to find  a Mexican  restaurant in the South hills."}
{"text":"The new location on Clairton blvd.near the Pleasant Hills cloverleaf is now open! it was worth the wait!   
    My mom had the steak quesadilla, and loved it! I was looking for something that didnt come with the usual beans and rice. The chilis rellenos with guacamole salad fit the bill. The chilis platter was piping hot,right out of the oven,and had a fabulous white creamy cheese sauce all over it that reminded me of a chihuahua cheese and salsa verde appetizer i had in Mexico. The wait staff was very friendly,and the  decor was fun, and the prices are right.
  Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"Very nice, great food, great service.  Nice place allaround.  The fajitas texanas for 2 was really furst rate.  I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a thursday around 730pm (they are open till 10). Came with a party of 5 and was seated quickly. Waited about 10 mns and our waiter still hasnt come to get our drinks. 15 mns roll around and the hostes has to come and give us our chips and salsa. Waited another 10 mns for the hostes to come back and take our drink orders. It took about 30 mns for the only waiter in the entire building to come and take our orders. I got one of their \"special margaritas\" and it was by far one of the worst ones ive ever had. The other drinks in the party didnt have any ice in them to top it off. I asked for a glass of water to replace the margarita and it took for ever to get to me. Then waited for close to 45 mns for the food to get to the table and most of our food was warm or cold. The waiter NEVER came back to check on us and now we are still waiting for our check so we can get out of here and NEVER COME BACK."}
{"text":"This is about the new location on 51N on at the cloverleaf. My husband and I LOVED the Old Mexico at Century III. We both would have given it 5 stars on any visit. I am going to preface this by saying neither of us has complained about a meal in the ten years we've been together and I don't think I ever have.

Anyway, unlike the Century III location, the place was packed, but I didn't mind, actually felt happy bc the one at Century III was like a hidden gem and I always felt like it never got credit it deserved. It was sooo good, but so obscure, anyways...
They clean up our booth and we're seated. Right away, we notice some changes- salsa and chips are now $3 an order, but new spot; overhead you know? I notice that all the staff has the overwhelmed expression of being DEEP in the weeds. We order margaritas and more chips/salsa. The chips and salsa are decent.

He ordered the chicken chimichanga, I got the tamale and cheese enchilada (#3 combination). The margaritas arrive, I don't know what they're thinking or what happened, but the once glorious lime margaritas are replaced by what looked like and tasted like orange juice on the rocks, no salt on rim:(. I thought maybe it was a virgin 'rita, but I look around and they all looked like that.   Yikes.

The food arrives quickly...This is where it gets all sketchy. My order wasn't correct, was a tamale and beef (not cheese) filled corn tortilla. Husband's chicken chimichanga was mostly lettuce and cheese-super bland, totally tasted like a sheetz chicken hoagie, which is fine in it's own way, but not what I'm thinking when I want Mexican. My tamales was good-at first, then, was very dry and bland as well. Rice was skimpy, like 1 grain deep in it's plated area , but the beans (refried) were good- very smoked hamhock heavy (if you like that, I do).

Waiter is GONZO...lost in the weeds, when he does arrive, tells us a classic margarita is unsalted and with orange juice...come on, man, literally everywhere in the world uses lime and salt...it's tequila for chrissakes. The drink is weak asf IF (and it's definitely possible) it had any alcohol in it at all!

And by now, I'm thinking what in the actual hell happened here? The owners did move locations, I do factor in increased overhead. Maybe they planned conservatively, and the fact that staff looked way stressed makes.me think so. I will go back in about 3-6 months. They were great once and could be again, I'm hoping they just need to get into the groove of being a once little known gem in the wasteland of the mall to transitioning to a very busy place now. Until then, it's a total no-go for me"}
{"text":"I have been there multiple times with 5 Star service, food and bill, so I don't understand anyone rating it less.  'Old Mexico' is a much needed, sit down Mexican cuisine restaurant this area desperately needed.  The staff seals the deal with their attention and concern for your pleasure.  It has become the place to go at least twice weekly.  Great menu."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and while its not horrible it's not great. Theres really nothing about this place that I find myself honestly loving. For starters I love flautas. I like mine with flour tortillas and a meat/chicken filling and sometimes cheese. While they did get the filling right they did not get the tortilla right. It was corn and not flour. Thus making them taquitos not flautas.  This was very disappointing. I might sound a little nit picky but I grew up in Arizona where there's a Mexican restaurant on every corner and its my comfort food. Also if you want extra salsa or chips you will be charged. To me this is just laughable. I have major issue paying for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. That only happens on the east coast. On my second visit I went with the chimichanga. Also nothing amazing. The only thing I can really say I liked were the margaritas because tequila. Hopefully they start getting their act together. It's been open for about a month and the bar still isn't finished. I'm just a bit annoyed with this place. I had such high hopes but was let down."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for dinner at Old Mexico. The service was fast and the food was outstanding! My husband had the chili relleno. Huge pepper and lots of cheese. I had the combo chili, taco. Both were very good and I brought some home for lunch tomorrow. It was 2.00 margarita  Thursday. What a treat! We will have to make Old Mexico a Thursday tradition."}
{"text":"A new restaurant at Century III Mall?  Had to try it a few days after the opening.  The food was good, nothing to brag about, but it was tasty.  $3 for a refill of chips and salsa is a little more expensive than other places as most are free, which is one reason we may or may not return. The sodas were flat, guess the fizz was not working yet. 
The decor was right out of Ruby Tuesday with some pretty paint. 
The service was excellent!
The chicken fajita was huge with plenty of chicken, the enchiladas were good. Overall everything was as expected."}
{"text":"After reading reviews here and at other sites that were all over the map I was a little hesitant about giving it a try.  We had a party of 6 and everyone liked what they ordered.   Some complained about the food not being hot, not so,it was piping hot.  Not only was the food tasty the portions were very generous.  We all needed containers for leftovers.  The server did a great job especially considering there were 5 separate checks between us with him getting all the orders right. 
      We never tried the former location at Century 3 so I can't compare them but we really liked this location. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent Mexican dinning experience."}
{"text":"Usually, when you are out of town looking for someplace to eat, you can't go wrong with Mexican food.  Can't say that with this place.  Very mediocre.  The food was very dry and tasted like it had been sitting a while.  If you are looking for Mexican in this area, try someplace else...."}
{"text":"So.... I got talked into going here because
A) there are no really good Mexican restaurants in the south hills
B) I really wanted a margarita 
C) I didn't feel like driving into lawrenceville

First of all, century III should be put out of its misery. It's a ghost town with the silver sneakers crowd doing laps around the empty mall. I hate going anywhere near this place.
But, I was willing to give it a try becuase of the mixed reviews I've seen on here.
To start, it was Friday, prime time! And.... Besides the 4 wait staff, we were the only ones there, strike one.
The waitress was very nice and knew the menu. One point redeemed
The margaritas were huge and very strong!! One more point redeemed.
Chips and salsa served when we sat down, fresh chips and homage salsa, pretty good!
We ordered two different combo payed so we could sample the different dishes.
The food arrives quick, which always scares me.. Why was it so easy to put together? Strike two.
When my question was answered when the food came. Although there was plenty of food, it wasn't very good
The refried beans were stale and tasteless and the rice was awful. If you're going to serve that as a standard thing, at least make it taste good. Strike three.
I have the taco the burrito and the relleno
Smothered in cheese and some sort of red sauce that had no flavor to it, almost like ketchup?
It was just not good. 
In an area where people actually go to, it might do well on its drinks alone, but seeing that it is located in a mall that had more employees than shoppers, I can't imagine it will stay long
Pittsburgh needs more good Mexican food, especially in the south hills."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican restaurant and most authentic one around! The workers there are nice and friendly and the margaritas are SUPER strong! The food portions are HUGE and the food is amazing. I've been here around 5 times now and haven't been disappointed once. Highly recommend if you're looking for some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Customer Service: 5
Value: 3
Food Quality: 2

If you are in this area and have a desire for Mexican Food than this spot has given me great customer service on all FOUR times that I've been here. 

Not once did I have to ask for a refill on the chips, not once did I have to ask for a refill on my drink. Not once did I have to worry about \"is my server coming back anytime soon?\" My server was always around if needed, would see when my glass was half full, and had great recommendations each night I visited. 

Thursdays are $2 Margaritas all day! Just a heads up!!

If you have eaten Mexican food in Texas, Mexico, New Mexico, or California, you are going to be very discouraged eating here as this has been turned into \"gringo food\", however they do have several \"spicy\" dishes that would be regular food in those places I mentioned.  

*Make sure you tell your server, \"I WANT TO REAL MEXICAN FOOD\" so that they will add the appropriate spices to your dish, instead of leaving it for the \"local demographic\" as them folks can't handle the good stuff. 

Yes I would return here for a hearty meal as this is an \"OK\" restaurant for me. I'd come back for the customer service, not the food."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican restaurant . Excellent service. Food was below average. Chips and salsa refills are not free."}
{"text":"Everyone at the bar was underage and way over served. You couldn't get the server to help you because he was busy flirting with said intoxicated people. 

Don't waste your money, go somewhere better."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but what really pissed me off was the fact that there was no changing table in the bathroom... and for being brand new the bathroom was dirty. Just overall disappointed"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a zero my food so  bland. My friends who was with me hated there food. My margaritas had no favor . it was so bad I tried putting sugar in it  to make It taste better but it didn't help . believe the bad reviews don't go there . I'm from Texas and I know real Mexican food and I don't know what you can called that . but it wasn't Mexican food. Save your money !"}
{"text":"First time here... I'd always wanted to go when they were at the mall but never did.  Was in the area running errands so it was a good time to try it! 
Place is really really cute! Servers were very friendly.   I got the chicken tacos in a hard shell.  They were tasty but a tad dry so I put salsa on them.  Mom had the chicken quesadilla and I didn't try any but she said they were very good.   
I'll definitely go back to try more menu items.   
Just a few suggestions I'd have ~ the girl that brought our chips and salsa didn't explain the difference between the two.  That would have been nice.  They were both good, but very different.  
And there are numerous big sand ashtrays as you walk in on the porch side.   They were over full of cigarette butts, just not a good look."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant last night with my family.  All of our meals were very delicious & we were very pleased with the portion sizes.  I will definitely eat here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this based on reviews. We were looking for Mexican not far from home and didnt want long waits on a Friday night. We were more than pleasantly surprised. 

We were seated immediately and the staff was friendly and extremely attentive.  Dinner was DELICIOUS. Good portions and good prices. Ive only had salsa from ONE place in Pittsburgh I liked better....this place is right up there. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"So good. Best tacos I've ever had. So simple, but so good! And I don't know how they make or where they get their sour cream, but I could eat it by the spoonful. Waitstaff is consistently friendly and the food comes out SO QUICKLY."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is terrible for Mexican food. But this place was amazing . Great lunch specials , service was amazing , great atmosphere . My waiter was on point ! Great place for lunch . Highly recommend in Pittsburgh . They charge extra for chips after one free one but that's cool. They're probably paying high rent for century iii but other than that it's a great place!"}
{"text":"Service was great, they had real Mexican beverages but the food was terrible. My food was pure mush, like baby food. The cheese dip tasted good but it was so runny. I got what I'm pretty sure was the supreme enchiladas. 1 chicken, 1 ground beef, one bean, one cheese. It had red sauce, everything covered in shredded lettuce. All the food was very very bland. I would never go back. The place was clean and I liked the decor, maybe I would go for drinks chips and salsa, but that's it."}
{"text":"The steak and chicken fajitas are amazing. The guac was perfect. It was Mother's Day and packed so service was a little slow as to be expected. Very friendly and everyone enjoyed their meal. It cost $80 for 2 adults and 4 kids to eat with and have the lava cake dessert (which was as good as it sounds). 
The only complain I have was with the shrimp fajitas..... there wasn't a lot of flavor.... or any flavor... aside from the onion and peppers. It was disappointing. I still ate it because I'm not a picky eater but I won't be ordering that again. I also didn't see any fish tacos on the menu which makes me sad. Over all it was a great place to eat and we will be eating there a lot in the future."}
{"text":"The alambres is the most expensive item on the menu and it is well worth every cent! Great flavors and value! The guac is also solid. Best Mexican around!!!"}
{"text":"While I must agree with previous reviewers that the portion sizes were large the food itself was pretty bland. The chili con carne has a bit of flavor and heat but the meat was tough and chewy. The enchiladas (which is one of my favorite Mexican foods) were flavorless and the sauce was disappointing. If you prefer your Mexican on the bland side this is the perfect restaurant.  Personally, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The original location of this restaurant was in Century 3 Mall.  The mall is closing and the people who own Old Mexico have been working hard to ready this location for them to move to.  I am happy to see it out on the main drag and flourishing.  Since people were no longer going to the mall I think they forgot about Old Mexico.  I'm glad that they decided to move and not just close.  We really enjoy their food.  I usually get their enchiladas but their fajitas are really good as well.  They give you free chips and salsa to inhale . . . I mean snack on while you look at the menu.  I must say that I'm a bit in love with their Mango Margarita, but they have regular and frozen.  No matter what you order you will enjoy it.  The food is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This visit I tried the chili rellenos and a tamale (side option.) I can't recommend either. The rellenos were drowning in cheese and sauce and lacked flavor.  The tamale had a sweet sauce, I think pineapple was in there, and it was ok but not a flavor I like. Also, there was so little chicken in the tamale. The salad that came with the rellenos was superb. I would happily eat that again. It was lettuce, sliced dark red tomatoes, avocado, grated cheese, maybe something else - and it all went together beautifully. I don't think there was any dressing and it didn't need any either.

We got beer this time as well. The waiter asked small, medium, or large?  I retorted with what's the difference in sizes? He motioned with his hands which was absolutely unhelpful. I don't know if he was trying to be funny or a jerk but neither approach works with me. I opted for medium thinking it would be a pint but actually it was larger. If you're looking for a modest beer to go with a meal, get the small. If you're planning on having a couple anyway, go with the medium.  Don't get the large unless you are also looking for a bicep workout. 

My companion again got the flautas, and I tried half of one.  That tasted great so I'll probably try that dish next time, along with a small beer.

For now, still four stars."}
{"text":"I can see why some reviews are so mixed.  This is a very nice space with a good atmosphere. They have mexican party music playing. I like being here!  The bar is in the center and above it are four TVs, each facing outward like a scoreboard over an ice rink.   There are plenty of booths all around.  The service was prompt and friendly, always calling me amigo.  The food, however, was a bit bland.  The rice, the type that typically accompany's Mexican dishes, had more flavor than my tamale, chili relleno, and tostada.  That's pretty bland!

Nevertheless I am giving four stars because of the nice overall experience.  This would be a great place to come with a group of friends, even coworkers!"}
{"text":"My family comes here every Tuesday and Thursday night for half off beef, chicken, soft, or hard taco for taco Tuesday and half off margaritas for thirsty Thursday the service is very nice but I would recommend learning a little Spanish :) just kidding they're all nice and welcome you like you're family. Always yummy and never disappointing. Also the food isn't half bad. For a family of four( 2 adults 1 teen and 1 vegetarian tween.) this place was pretty good. For the adults get a small mango lime margarita for one and then the other can drink a specialty mock tail. And then for dinner order the nachos old Mexico and share them. For the teen get the steak fajitas quesadilla. And for the vegetarian tween get the cheese nachos or if you want to keep it simple get the kids quesadilla with a side of rice. My daughter's instructions to making the perfect quesadilla there is to get cheese dip(queso) and then to add it in the quesadilla then add the side of rice into it and then you have a perfect quesadilla. Tip: with the leftover queso add to rice to make cheesy rice. I love this place and love the staff to its like it came strait out of Mexico."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Mexican spots in Pittsburgh because of the consistency of the food and the fantastic margaritas! 

It is clean, decorated in colorful Mexican decor and entertains with Latin music and television in the bar area. 

Servers are always superb and attentive."}
{"text":"Well the north isn't known for its great Mexican food, this place is your typical run of the mill Mexican food place.  The main reason I'm giving it 2 stars is what Mexican place doesn't have free refills on chips and salsa.  The food was good, not great, but it definitely hit the spot for the Mexican craving.  But seriously 5 bucks for a refill on chips and salsa get out of here with that."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the portions were very big. Definately will be coming back here to eat.  Our server was very friendly also. The bathroom was clean which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"One time here and I quickly found that I am a believer! Boy, is the food fresh and yummy! I ordered the guacamole appetizer, which was served with chips, though it was so wonderful I just ate it with a spoon. The salsa is hands down, the best salsa I've had! You can taste the fresh ingredients in every bite! I think the guacamole appetizer was around $4 or 6, which is a great price considering it is a large serving. I also ordered the chicken fajita, which was packed with vegetables, chicken and oil- completely satiating and full of flavor! Everyone's food looked excellent, there was nothing that didn't look completely and utterly appetizing. The restaurant is cute inside- it looks like a smaller operated chain so it isn't extravagant or over the top. In fact, much of the decor is rather random and looks handmade, but still gives you an authentic vibe. I really enjoyed my overall experience here and am looking forward in being a regular here!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical walking into this place since I've never been to an Old Mexico. I'm picky when it comes to my food, but I didnt have any issues.

We didn't wait to be seated and had our drinks before we even opened our menus. I thought they were bringing us someone elses food at first, but it was nachos and 2 types of salsa for us to munch on while we wait. 


It was obvious that the staff was busy. They were running every which way to tend to the other guests. With that being said, our food arrived quickly, our drinks were never empty, and our waiter was absolutely wonderful. 

I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"The family and I love the Belle Vernon location. This is no where near as good as the BV location. Service was fast, First star. Food arrived hot, second star. Wife and kids food was ok. I ordered the Pablano Peppers and was served Stuffed red peppers. When I questioned this I was told that they are the same thing. Really, never new that. Again I told them that I was unimpressed with the pale and was asked if I wanted removed. They did but not off of the check. Stick with the B V location they know the difference between bell peppers and Pablano"}
{"text":"My meal was very disappionting. The salsa tasted like unseasoned tomato sauce and I the chili rellenos were no better. Peppers were oddly sweet, like a green pepper, then smothered in a bland white cheese and topped with a red sauce that tasted just like the salsa. My husband said his meal was ok, but I would definitely steer clear of the rellenos."}
