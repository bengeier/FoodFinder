{"text":"Great little place! Definitely a hidey hole, but good food and funny owner. I like the kind of place that the owner is the waiter and cook... And this is that type of place. I would definitely recommend Zorbas to anyone who asks.  App: cilantro and jalape√±o hummus with warm pita. Yum!  I had a gyro with fries and both were great. Wife had gyro with Greek salad, she's pregnant and she loved every bite."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant with excellent food.  The food is about as good as it gets, and that says a lot since we are from Chicago and used to go to Greek Town all the time. The Saganaki was excellent and our meals were just as good.  There were four of us - two had the lamb, one had the lemon chicken, and I had the Mousaka.  All the food was prepared perfectly and had wonderful flavor.  The portions were large and each meal also came with a nice sized salad. Service was great, the owner is very friendly and accommodating, and the prices are right.  This is definitely somewhere you need to go."}
{"text":"We have tried a lot of mediteranian places.  This is one of the best.  The greek salad is excellent, nice greens and very rich olive oil dressing.  The people who run this are always helpful"}
{"text":"On this visit, which was the first time to Zorba's, I ordered the vegetarian platter $10.99 which consists of hummus, babaganouj, 3 dolmas, 3 falafel, tahini, tzaziki and 2 pitas. Also included: saffron rice, greek salad, lemon roasted potatoes, and vegetable of the day.  Husband ordered the lamb souvlaki plate $12.99, medium. While the lamb was very tender and juicy, it was cooked well done. We also tried the greek fries (feta and greek dressing) $3.99. This was a great choice. Very light dressing to help the feta stick to the fries, but not swimming in sauce or grease. MUST TRY. I was very satisfied with the portions in relation to the price. Right where it should be. While the hummus and babaganouj were tasty, I would love to taste more \"smokiness\" in the baba. That may be a personal preference. The dolmas were not slimy or squishy which is a common issue when ordering this item at Greek restaurants. The pita was warm, soft and presented beautifully on the plate.  As well as beautiful presentation, I was pleased that the salad served was not drenched in oily dressing, which can be another cooking mistake. It was lightly dressed yet satisfying and flavorful. Adding a couple lemon slices on the side would be a great addition.  The lemon potatoes were perfectly cooked, yet lacked any real lemon flavor. I myself have tried making these at home and I believe the trick is to cook the potatoes about 75% of the way, then marinate in lemon juice overnight. When you cook the remaining 25% on a pan in the oven, you can REALLY taste the lemon.  Nevertheless, I think Zorba's is a great find. Service was adequate. I say this because we had 3 different employees tending to us. This approach lacks personalization in my opinion.  Overall, I would definitely come back to Zorba's. A \"happy hour\" discount on the platters or apps would be great! Zorba's also offers pizzas and pastas, which caught me off guard at first. None of these have a Greek twist or flavor. I would love to see a Greek pizza (gyro or lamb meat, feta, onions, peppers, tzaziki sauce or some such variation).  Lastly, the decor and setting were comfortable and welcoming. Very nice! I am rating at 4 stars because there is a little room for improvement."}
{"text":"Wished I could have said better things about Zorba's given that the owner/manager seems very hospitable.  We decided to try this restaurant because we had a localoffer certificate and when we went for lunch it was not accepted because we were told that it is only accepted for dinner (even though the certificate had no mention of it).  We ordered the Moussaka which was freshly made and was jusk ok.  The Chicken Shwarma lacked flavor and was also below par.  So we decided to use our certificate we would go for dinner.  Things just got worse as it seemed like the owner was doing the cooking and also trying to serve as well.  It took nearly half hour to get the appetizer.  The entree, the gyros were supposed to be wonderful, but once again a sore disappointment.  Other partrons were getting impatient and a party of 10+ people just came and then quickly left.  This place needs some serious operational guidance to survive and succeed."}
{"text":"Nice job, Zorba's! Solid recipes and freshly-made food makes all the difference. Best spanokopita and falafel that I've had in a long time. Affordable and the service was as friendly as can be!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!! Enjoyed every bite! New owners and great variety. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"Went with my wife for last dinner out before starting a new diet and now wish we were not starting the diet as it will be at least 3 months before we can go back.  We started with Traditional Hummus with Pita which was very well prepared and came with plenty of pita.  I had Beef Souvlaki Plate and my wife had Gyros Plate.  Both had generous amount of food and were better than many other Greek restaurants we have been to.  The owner and staff were all very friendly and eager to assist.  Will definitely return once the new diet phase is over."}
{"text":"Love the place! We've been coming here for years. Wonderful food and atmosphere, and a great patio!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love!! Food and service was awesome.  Everything was great and great prices.  You could definitely tell everything was fresh and authentic.  Definitley will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch during work. Probably not the best time. The food was excellent, but it took forever to get to the table. Gyro (with added feta) and fries were really good. It came with extra tzatziki. The meat was sliced thicker than I am used to and had good spices. The pita had a lot of cucumber and tomato and onion (good things!). Person I was with got a Zorba burger (hamburger with gyro meat on top) with Greek salad. The waiter said it was an often requested, best seller. She said it was really good and the salad was great. The guys next to us had lamb and potatoes and the other a chicken pita that looked, but most people around seemed to be sticking with a gyro.  There was not really a crowd and the food was good, but it took almost an hour from sit down to order to getting the meal to paying. Not good for people looking for in and out meal on lunch hour. I will go back when I have nowhere to be. The waiter was really nice and the guy from the kitchen was bringing the food out a plate at a time, so they were working together, but Lord, it took a long time.  Will definitely be back, especially now since my usual Greek restaurant just closed!"}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped here for an early dinner and we both had the gyro plate. Honestly the best gyro I have ever had, so good. Took home some baklava for dessert and again the so good... wonderful.  This is my first yelp review ever but I so hope this restaurant sticks around that I wanted to share our experience... Five stars.  Service and food excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for over a year now and I've observed its ups and downs. It's a mom and pop, which I support over a corporate chain restaurant any day. The food is always top notch (with the exception of a few visits where I knew they were struggling to stay in business). That being said, Zorba's is now under new ownership and I know they are working to upgrade the menu and get the bar area fully stocked and running, but it will take time and support from the regulars as they work toward positive upgrades and bringing in more people.   We were there last night and I ordered the lamb shank, which was stellar, and my friend had the garlic shrimp dish which she gave two thumbs up also. The produce for the salads is always fresh and clean and crisp. The pita bread is served warm and soft and the hummus spiced just right and tasty.   There was no alcohol served last night as they are updating their liquor license and, as I said, they're working on upgrading the bar area which fell short under previous ownership.   This little place is a gem that is in the process of being polished, in my opinion. The owner has some great ideas for the future of this place and I hope to see those ideas come through.   Try the place out. I highly recommend it. And support your local businesses. They need it and it does great things for the local economy when we back them up."}
{"text":"Do not go here! This place has new owners who treat their staff very poorly. They basically fired most of the old staff and brought in new people who know nothing about Greek food. The owner doesn't even how to run a restaurant. The owner also thought he could help himself to the staffs tips."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food, been here many times and it always quality. Good service and very authentic. Highly recommend the lamb souvlaki, not a chain and it is one of a kind."}
{"text":"The gyros were tasteless, their coke had stuff floating in it  and the service was lackluster at best."}
{"text":"I work nearby and use Zorba's to treat coworkers from out of town. It's always a big hit and the food is delicious.  Recommend the gyro for lunch."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular in this place... Ginny was the greatest, and the food, to die for!  Returned after a short break to give the new owners a chance & to fulfill my craving for some Greek food...  Mistake!!!!!  All the gentleman running the bar did was complain that the \"regulars\" (he did not remember me apparently) deserted him and how the staff walked out.  Crybaby!!!  Don't expect people to stay after you say nothing will change and yet it all does!  Food portions were half the size and not well prepared or tasty, and prices were raised.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"We went here with our three children, it's a homely place. Very loving owner who served us. This place has a bar. Place was clean, the food was fresh and yummy. Enough food and then some, we had enough for our next meal. The kids never had Greek food and they loved it. We will be going again for sure. Steak shwarma, gyro plate, spaghetti with meat balls were great choices. Next time we will be sure to try lamb shanks let you know that tasted."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a Kilt Lifter and a great appetizer , Zorba dip.   AMAZING.  Owner is welcoming and the food is great.   Try it"}
{"text":"I walked in in a Friday night at 7 pm.  Place was DEAD.  That's always concerning.  But I went ahead and ordered take out for the family anyway.  I should if just turned and walked out.  Very expensive and food wasn't very good.  I'm amazed how this place is still open.  I would probably give them another shot by bringing the family in for a sit down meal but the aura of the place gives me the willies.  Decor is terrible and with no none else in there, it's depressing."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek Mediterranean food! New management took over earlier this year and created a fantastic menu complete with flaming cheese! I've been back a few times trying different foods. All delicious. Service is gracious and pleasant. Comfortable atmosphere. Being from Detroit's Greektown I can say with confidence this place is Opa!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood gem always hits the spot! The ingredients are fresh and the service is friendly. Free wi-fi and the owner always checks in on you. Wish it was closer I'd be there daily!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I had the lamb shank and my husband had the Kefta Kabob, both were delicious ( as well as the home made hummus). I recommend  highly to anyone wanting to promote local businesses."}
{"text":"Looking for great meal while out shopping for moving boxs seen this place and wanted to try the gyros. I just wants to say oh my god greatest gyro ive had since ive moved to az. Great lunch price under 20$ for me and my girlfriend will be happy to come back and have another bite you must try this place out."}
{"text":"Ate here once. The food was OK. Service was slow. The atmosphere was really bad. There is a bar attached to the restaurant that had the music turned up loud. It totally killed the restaurant vibe. They need to decide if they are a raucous nightclub that serves food or a nice restaurant that serves drinks. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had previously been here and was dissatisfied .. environment was hot and sticky and service was less than par at that time (2012), food was just okay. I never returned because the staff/owners there were just plain rude and off putting.. But this week, I was in a pickle and needed some food so I decided to stop in again. This time it was different... it is under new ownership and they have made some aesthetic changes but are still working on fine tuning things. I met the owner who was very nice  , I ordered a gyro plate with Greek salad and all was delish! I really couldn't complain even though I had previously had a negative association with this place. I wish them luck and hope to see it improve and be vibrant again!"}
{"text":"Thought I had posted a review but evidently just left a picture.  This restaurant thrilled us both.  It is exactly what we expect a dining experience to be.  Wonderful food here; we'll definitely be back.  And so it goes ... we returned yesterday and loved it again.  Try this place; you'll love it."}
{"text":"Great food, good portion sizes, reasonable prices. Gyro was juicy and delicious, vegetables were awesome and better than I've had at high end restaurants. The owner was warm and friendly. He made us feel right at home with our two young kids.  We tipped 50% of the bill since we were so happy with the food and service. That doesn't happen very often. Love this neighborhood mom and pop place and we will come back regularly."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of gyros and Zorba's does it right. High quality meat, very fresh ingredients and authentic tasting tzatziki sauce.   Add in excellent friendly service and Zorba's is a win."}
{"text":"We walked in Thursday evening and immediately noticed something was very different. New out door seating, new interior design, less bar/restaurant more restaurant, no Jenny.  I started looking at the menu it's different, more Italian dishes than there used to be. Then I looked up yelp reviews and started to worry... Worry not, yes it is different but nothing really stays the same especially in the restaurant business. I got Greek meatballs and chicken and rice soup. Husband got the mixed steak and chicken suovlaki plate with salad, saffron rice, hummus and veggies. Everything (except the salad) was temperature Hot, Hot, Hot just the way I like it! The veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly. Meatballs were my least favorite but everything else was delish!!   Owner's wife waited on us she is super sweet and friendly and attentive. If you haven't been lately give it a go with an open mind and support the local mom and pop shop. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience. The food is very tasty and the atmosphere is Greek.  Very soothing authentic music and the owner is delightful."}
{"text":"After spending a good amount of time looking for a good gyro joint, a friend recommended Zorba's to me, and I am so glad she did. EVERY time I've gone, both the food and service have been stellar. I usually go for lunch and get the gyro with Greek fries. On the few occasions I've gone for dinner, I've gotten the lamb shank, and it lives up to everything the menu says: so tender it falls off the bone. You can't get a better value for the amount of amazing food you get. On top of that, the service is always some of the best I've ever had. Whether it's the owner himself waiting on me, or just a server, they've been some of the nicest people I've met in a restaurant. The owner is hilarious, and always checking in at least once to make sure everything is good. Overall, it's everything any restaurant should strive to be on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Zucchini sticks not very flavorful. Gyro plate and lamb shank were very good!  Take home some baklava-yumm!  Live music made for nice ambience! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Took a friend for her birthday dinner.   First time for both of us even though we live right by Zorba's.  Figured that since it had been there for years we should try it.  WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!     We ordered the flaming saganaki and tzatziki for appetizers.  They flame it at the table and was delicious. The tzatziki and pita chips were fabulous.    We ordered the gyros platter and the kefta kabob.  My friend really wanted an actual gyro sandwich and they only serve that at lunch but they made her a sandwich anyway.   Everything was fantastic.   But the star of the show was the baklava.  Best we've ever had. And we've had a lot of baklava!!  Made in house.   Recommend Zorba's to anyone who loves authentic Greek food.  Chef is fantastic and visits with the customers.   Can't say enough good things.   Service a bit slow but the food was so good we didn't care."}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back! Had the hummus with chicken and also tried the flaming feta. Service was amazing! Server was Hesham, such a character! He made us an after dinner cocktail he called Greek Sunshine. According to him 2 will turn the sky blue automatically...it's magical. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious, well prepared and the ingredients tasted fresh through and through. Visited on March 12th 2015, got a coffee, chicken pita and the pita/hummus appetizer. Staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating in all aspects. I personally love Greek style cuisine and although I got the more generic menu items as my first try with there restaurant, knowing how good that turned out I look forward to returning with friends and family to explore there more exotic choices. I would recommend anyone to visit and explore their taste pallet because I guarantee they won't fall short of great food and great service. Next time I will be getting their Lentil soup and Baba Ghanoush (hope I spelled that right lol)."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food, and was excited when I saw this place pop up on Groupon - great, a new place I haven't tried yet! So I looked them up to see if it was worth spending money on, and all I see is review after review of the owner being a dick to anyone having a Groupon. I mean, isn't the point of a business doing that to draw in new business? And if you don't like it, simply don't do it... But you can't fault and berate customers for you signing up to do it. Maybe invest in better advertising if you don't like Groupon to get your name out there (because I had never heard of them before Groupon suggested it). There are plenty of Mediterranean places I would rather spend my money on full price, just to be respected as a customer. So I haven't been or tried the food, but the reviews about how the owner is, lead me to believe I'm making a smart choice in not doing so."}
{"text":"First time in the place with the new owners. All the previous revoiews are true. My wife, daughter and I went for dinner. As the waiter/busser/bartender brought out our order, I noticed a small roach on the bench. The guy picked up a napkin, grabbed it and that was it. No apology, no concession on the check. Not even an a simple acknowledgement of THE GODDAM COCKROACH SIX INCHES FROM MY THREE -YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. ddON'T GO NEAR THIS TOXIC WASTE DUMP EVER"}
{"text":"First time visit I felt horrible due to calling my order in too late. I called to see what time they close the gentleman who answered the phone says they close in 5 min. I told him thank you ill try next time. He said its ok what is it that you want to order i keeped telling him nevermind because it was already late, but he insisted. I apologize and told him my order. I arrived within 5 min later (i was down the street) the gentleman and i had a conversation while waiting for my food he was very nice.   Oh man the food is really good. We had ordered 2 Gyros and a babaganosh its a eggplant dip. I think its way better than hummus, but only if you like eggplant. We liked the food so much we went back the next night. That time we added fries and spanakopita to our order. I have to tell you the customer service and the food is really good i cant described it anymore. Just go and try for yourself. Hubby and I think its the best Gyros weve ever had."}
{"text":"Well I can hardly believe it but it's finally time to take Zorba's off the list of restaurants we enjoy dining at.  We went to Zorba's with the idea of a take out order of gyros and fries. The gyros were fair, the fries were terrible. Over cooked but limp with a burned flavour that was so objectionable I only ate a few.  But the last straw for me was the service. I asked a very simple thing; please put the tzaziki on the side. That's all, very simple. Not only did they not put the tzaziki on the side, they put on extra. So by the time we got our food home I had greasy burned fries and a soggy gyros.  That's all folks, I am done with Zorba's and I recommend that you not bother going yourself."}
{"text":"First time here. The owner and the whole wait staff (family) were superb, down to earth, and just exceedingly friendly. As the owner said, \"I don't have customers, I just have family and friends!\" Tried the humus Trio (we liked the Cilantro & Jalape√±o the best) for the app. Then I had the moussaka and my boyfriend ordered the gyro plate. Our meals came with a side Greek salad. The dressing was the real star for me; lemony and tangy. It, like the salad and hummus was clearly made fresh. Boyfriend LOVED his gyro plate. Their meat and tzatziki sauce really made the dish. Seriously, best tzatziki I've ever had. Again, everything fresh and flavorful.  I had never had moussaka before, but I'm glad I tried it here.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Every meal we've had here is fantastic...wait staff are excellent...friendly and very accommodating...we've made it a weekly stop!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. The flaming saganaki was great and the chicken shawarma and gyro meat had excellent flavor. Loved the Greek fries too, and the service was quite good. Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Zorba's Greek caf√© it is such a great experience!!! I actually have not dined in yet I get my food to go. My favorite is the Greek salad and the dressing is delicious and I get two sides of to tzaziki to put on top. The marinated chicken on the salad is absolutely delicious. Kendi who works there is so sweet and really cares about customer service. Give this place a try, you will love it!"}
{"text":"We went to Zorba's for the first time last night as a party of 10. We tried just about everything on the menu, and every one of us loved the food. The pita bread was amazingly soft and warm, the meat was seasoned to perfection, the salads were as fresh as it gets, the beer was ice cold, and we were even entertained by a belly dancer. Before we left, we met Chef H. who is also the new owner. He speaks six different languages and has studied to be a chef all over the world. He prepares food from the best of what he has learned in his travels, and adds his personal touch. You can tell that he loves being a chef simply by taking your first bite. My family and I lived in Europe for six years, and the food at Zorba's is exactly the kind of food that you would find there. We have found our new favorite restaurant. Don't waste your time anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Entered restaurant and was greeted promptly, after I was seated, I asked for a glass of water with lemon, I got water with LIME. I ordered a gyro with no sauce and well done fries, it came with sauce on it and cucumber cubes in the sandwich and fries that were half cooked. Server didn't ask how it was until I was ready to leave and as I explained the problem, she said \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding and walked away. The booth was run down and had no cushion and the place was run down. Although the server was nice, she did not listen to my requests. There fore the 2 stars are for the effort and politeness, not the food."}
{"text":"We go probably once every two weeks and have never had a bad meal or bad service. Employees are friendly, warm and the food is awesome. We always bring out of towners here. Can't believe it's never busy! It's SO good."}
{"text":"I have eaten there 5 times since I found it. The staff are good people, my boys took us thier on my wife's Birthday. Everyone love the food and staff."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in quite a while and could tell immediately that the restaurant was under new management from both the looks of it and of the folks running it.  We were the only ones in the restaurant, ; we sat out on front patio which is new, apparently.  The inside was changed a bit, incorporating couches at an attempt to increase the ambiance.  It's a nice start, makes things cozier--I like it.     The owner and his chef waited on us, and they were very attentive, friendly and accommodating.  They brought us surprise lentil soups, after we had munched on our hummus for a bit.  Hummus was very tasty and garlicky, a bit chunkier than I'm used to, but delish.  The pita bread was SUPERB, fresh, warm and certainly homemade.  My husband ordered the lamb shank and said it was very tasty.  My Greek salad with gyro meat was fabulous, rivaling any I've had, and both of our meals were so large we ate less than 2/3 of them (granted, we'd eaten quite a bit already between the hummus and pita and (requested) cucumbers and the lentil soup).  We felt we got a very good value for our money.   We chatted with the owner and the chef a bit and enjoyed them immensely.  Apparently, Chef H (who had a restaurant in Gilbert previously, Chef H Restaurant and Grill) was very recently hired and is a stickler for fresh ingredients and is working help turn things around there.     We really our enjoyed our meals and of course the delicious baklava at the end.  We will be back!!  Give it another try if you haven't been very recently or a new try if you've never been."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food  It has become our absolute favorite Greek Restaurant in Chandler"}
{"text":"My wife and I have frequented this familiar place for years and loved Ginny's excellent service and personality. She has, as several other posts have indicated, sold the restaurant to new owners and sadly they have changed and not for the better.   The menu was different. The plating of the food was poorly done. The portions have been scaled back and the prices have been scaled forward.   We just got back from our LAST VISIT to this place and I was horrified with the poor quality of the food, the service, and we were the only ones in the entire place for quite a while.   In retrospect, I'm not surprised since everyone that frequented Zorba's apparently already knows what we were terribly disappointed to find out.   I hate to have to write a poor review for a restaurant that we have loved for years. I'm fairly certain, judging by the lack of patronage as well as the poor excuse for Greek food, that this place will close down very soon.   Goodbye Ginny! We will miss your smile, your love, and your wonderful food."}
{"text":"First time we went there the owner was more than happy to let us order the pita sandwiches and salad for dinner even though they are listed as lunch items. When we went back the second time and tried to order the same thing he started a rant telling us in all of the years he has been in business he has never allowed that.  Needless to say we left and will not be going back. We like to support locally owned businesses but this is one we will not be going back to."}
{"text":"We came here expecting good Greek food as it has always been before. It was so hot and sticky when you first entered. We waited an eternity just for them to ask us what we wanted to drink, then another ten minutes just for them to bring it. I ordered the regular gyro and salad (which was $1.99 extra for salad) my husband had the GLT a gyro, lett., tomato sandwich which came with a salad. Our first server who I believe was the owner, was a bit rude as if he didnt feel like serving. To be nice, he brought us chicken lentil soup on the house. I only took about 3 bites as it was completely disgusting and flavorless. I had to add pepper, salt and hot sauce and still nothing. Our meals came out about 30 seconds of us receiving the soup. The tzatziki sauce smelled AWFUL!!! It literally smelled like old cheese or bad foot odor. There was barely any meat in my gyro. As for the salad, it had no feta cheese or bellpeppers. It was completely bland with barely and dressing. Our server who looked like to be the busser because he looked grimey and had an ugly apron on, barely came to check on us. My husbands meal was just a TAD better than mine, with his salad being the same as well. I definately do not recommened this place AT ALL!! Please stay away and go somewhere else!! I will NEVER be returning here again!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to trying gyro plate from looking at all the reviews. Our waitress was fun and friendly; the food took a while to come out but we did not mind. Our gyros plate was okay, had better food at other greek places.   The main reason for the one star is the attitude of the owner. We went in to redeem our Groupon on saturday afternoon. The owner came to assist and refused to accept the groupon, stating only valid on \"slower times\"and also told us \"he has to make money somehow\". It does not say anything about valid on certain dates. I ended up paying for the meal full price and was not happy about the customer service."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The food is made to perfection, the atmosphere is on point, service is top notch and the music jut puts it all together!"}
{"text":"Big changes here.  We are so pleased to have the ability to enjoy this restuaurant again.  Fresh food, great staff.  The feeling of the place is great now and the new chef is doing great things."}
{"text":"RUN FAST AND FAR FROM THIS PLACE! If I could give a negative I would.  Slow, over 1 hour wait for lunch. Used Groupon which says $10.00 towards food owner / cook whatever he is said no you have to purchase over 10.00 plate each (there were 3 of us). Reluctantly we did purchase over $30.00 for lunch. The food was cold and had no flavor only went 2 blocks by car, And lets not forget the 6.00 tip for waiting. Yep because we were seated waiting for out to go order we were made to feel like we HAD to leave a tip. NEVER AGIAN. Here's to hoping they go out of business. By the way there were only 2 other tables waiting for food. What a huge rip off. Its a shame that restaurants like SPICES went out of business but this place remains in business."}
{"text":"This place is literally as amazing as it gets. I can't even stand it. The manicotti, the gyro, and the LEMON CHICKEN SOUP IS TO DIEEEE FOR! Also the hummus is just great. One of my go-to favorite places. When I had the flu and a cold that's all I could eat. It was amazing! This is my 4th or 5th time and I have brought everyone I know! Also don't even get me started on how sweet and friendly the staff are. I think I met the owner as well he is so sweet. The service is great. All around just absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro, greek salad, and creamy lemon chix soup, hubby ordered a burger and fries.  The soup took 20 minutes and was a tasteless chix broth, with shredded chix and undercooked rice. When I questioned the soup and why it wasn't traditional creamy greek lemon chix soup, the owner, whom was also the waiter stated that ppl complained it was too heavy. The menu stated that it is a creamy soup??? It was awful and I sent it back, that should have been my first clue as to the rest of the experience.  The burger was bland and the fries were raw in the center. My gyro was overcooked and tasted like shoe leather.We called the owner over to discuss and to also show him how filthy the salt and pepper shakers were and that the ketchup was all crusty, it also had solidified ketchup on the outside of the bottle too. The salt shaker was held together by tape, you can see it in the picture. Clearly nothing had been cleaned for quite some time. He proceeded to tell us that was from the lunch crowd and he didn't have time to clean it. It was 3:30PM and we were the only ones there when we arrived.  He then picked up the shakers, wiped the top off with his hands, and then shook out the salt and pepper and stated see they work just fine...really? How absolutely disgusting!!!!   He then started yelling and swearing at us, stating how dare we tell him how to clean his restaurant, and for us to get out, we said gladly. He then had the audacity to say wait, wait you have to pay me first...we stated we would not be paying him for unedible food that we had only tasted and was terrible. He stated he was going to call the Police, we said please do and waited outside of the restaurant for the Police to show up, he continually kept coming outside demanding us to pay and trying to bait my husband into a physical altercation, by aggressively swearing at us and calling us some pretty awful names. We continued to remain outside, cool, calm and collected, I think that actually made him more mad. He obviously never called the Police and we eventually left after waiting for about 15-20 minutes for the Police to show up.  I will be contacting the dept. of health and informing them of the filth. The more we looked around, the more we noticed. They had a ceiling fan that is literally hanging out of the ceiling by nothing more than the electrical wires. The fans were filthy too.   Seriously do yourselves a favor and go elsewhere, food is bad, the few bites made us both sick and the owner is outrageously rude."}
{"text":"Zorba's is all about GREAT FOOD.  It's a carnivore's paradise!  Whether you get the lamb shank which is a STEAL at 13.99 or a Gyro salad you just can't go wrong.  The humus trio will make you never want Pita Jungle hummus again!  The sides are delicious and the owner is always extremely warm and friendly!  I was worried about taking my daughters there, but he even convinced two of the world's pickiest eaters to try some new things, and they loved it too!  My 1st daughter LOVED the Fettuccine Alfredo.  I tasted it myself, and it was amazing!  My 2nd daughter is not much of an eater, but the owner offered her a taste of the Keftedes, (ground beef & lamb meatball).  She really enjoyed that and it was good to see her eat real food for a change.  I tasted her keftedes myself too and that has become one of my favorite appetizers there.  Fortunately, I work nearby and often get a gyro or a Greek Salad for lunch.  Their gyros come with a ton a of meat and it's all incredibly delicious at a ridiculously good price which is even more amazing considering just how good everything is, how large the portions are and the love that the owner puts into his food.   The Moussaka is another wonderful decadent treat!  THANK YOU Zorba's for all the great meals!!!!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent the old Zorba's ... Thought tonight's meal was excellent .. 2 appetizers + a Gyros plat and lamb kabob ... all was very fresh and flavorful ... service was great ... much better than we expected .. we will be back soon ... Keep up the great job ... Zorba's"}
{"text":"Omg.. the food is super tasty.  Very well prepared. The lamb and the vegetables  are ahhmazing.. So glad I came here.  The owner is super friendly and welcoming.  I will come back !"}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Greek food. I did takeout and waited for the food to be made. Owner warned me wait would be long because the food is made fresh to order.  I enjoyed a glass of wine while I waited.  The owner is so nice and pleasant to talk to.  I highly recommend this restaurant you will not be disappointed. Nice portions. Good prices"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've never dined in but whenever I order take out, it's awesome.  The owner is SUPER nice and makes me feel welcome every time I come in.  The food is so tasty and fresh. They never disappoint me.  Thanks guys! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Would have done zero stars if possible. Got the Groupon to try em out and we arrived at 12:30 on a Saturday and they were closed. Sign says Noon-9:00pm and not a soul in site. Tried to call and no answer. Bad business, getting a refund from Groupon and wont return."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! Their lamb shank is legit! Meat falls off the bone. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the Gyro here and I have to say I'm glad to finally have found some in the PHX area that has some real flavor. Also the Tiziaki was delicious.  I will definitely come back here to get my Gyro fix."}
{"text":"This is not the adult bookstore in Scottsdale.  It is the hole in the wall authentic greek restaurant in Chandler.  They have wonderful food in a small intamate setting.  We have been quite a few times and have never gotten food that was even just good.  If you are looking for some good greek and a nice quiet place, this is the one for you."}
{"text":"The lamb shank was outstanding! My wife had the gyro plate and said it was great. The baklava was first rate. The fried, breaded zucchini was  bland really need to add some taste to the batter. Service was perfect, she had my coffee cup filled as soon as it hit the 50% mark, very professional!  They had a troubadour singing some great Dylan style music in the background. Very nice place for a quiet relaxing date night."}
{"text":"Ok this place is just wonderful... Really think the problem is the strip mall local.... But I've never had anything but a delish meal... The Saganaki (flaming cheese for the un-initiated is the way to go for an appy) the lamb shanks are the bomb and the gyros are the best!!! The owner is the sweetest pea EVER!!! Swing by and tell me if I'm wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Greek food I've ever had but decent enough that I keep coming back. The pieces are extremely fair for the quality and portions. They lose a star because I've tried to go several times during their \"open\" hours and they've been closed. Usually it's around 8:30pm midweek when I've been stuck working late and really, really want a gyro or falafel. Bummer. Pita Jungle it is. I don't know that it's worth staying open on a slow night for \"just me\"  to come in to get a pita, a falafel and a side of baba, but if I've had this experience more than once, I can't be the only one.  The baba is a little oily and separates though it has a nice flavor. The gyro is solid with dill pickle spear. The falafel sandwich is huge in comparison to other places nearby with 3-4 hunks of falafel for $4. Yes, $4.   My order is normally a falafel sandwich, a gyro sandwich and a side of baba/pita for ~$14. I usually tip on top of that because even though I do take out, I never order in advance and the servers always being a glass off cold, crisp water while I wait on one of the comfy leather couches."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and the food was fresh and delicious. My friend who was with me and visiting from The Middle East also was very impressed with the quality of the food. This is a small \"mom and pop\" restaurant. And I love to support local businesses.So, if you want to experience authentic, fresh food from the Mediterranean and support a local entrepreneur, this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm pretty upset with this place. I yelped it first and instantly a coupon specific to here came up. It was a 100% off your first visit voucher. I showed our waitress the voucher and she tells me it is not valid, she tells me that was for Mother's Day. When I opened the voucher it asked me if I wanted to redeem it now or later. It had nothing on it about Mother's Day. They refused to let me use it. I was with my 1 year old and an old friend so I couldn't just leave. We ate lunch and it was not bad, but the voucher dismissal left a bad taste in my mouth. Grr"}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant I've had here in Arizona. Amazing food and service. The restaurants feels like it is family owned and truly cares about the customers experience. You have to go and try it. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Stumbled here because it was one of those nights where we were just sick of the places we usually dine at. Maybe this will lift our spirits?  The decor could have done better, there are loud tv's in the corner, very little lighting, greenish paint, but not messy. The salad was overdosed with oil vinaigrette, I should have asked for dressing on the side. The gyro plate was plentiful with rice, potato, and the awesome gyro. Service was a bit slow because they were celebrating a waitress's birthday in the back, which is understandable but annoying when you are out of water for 10 minutes.  Total bill came to $20.43 for the both of us, not bad for a sit-down restaurant, food is good but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Up and coming restaurant.  The owner is always in and remembers us and treats us like family, very friendly guy. Still struggling through the new business growing pains but charging on.  The food is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!!! We have been on multiple occasions and each time very impressed"}
{"text":"I had passed Zorba's for years, not stopping, because my husband is a picky eater.  What finally brought us (in) was a Groupon.  This is a family owned and operated business which goes out of their way to make everyone feel welcomed.  They absolutely have a following, addressing many patrons by name, and the owner/chef bumped our table twice during dinner.  What I noticed immediately upon entering was the smell of cheese and food.  Smells often work against me but I was able to hold it together, and it's important to say my husband noticed nothing.  Noticed next, was the hodge-podge decor, not eclectic, but disconnected, old and heavily worn, though the restaurant is clean. So many elements (too many elements) left me feeling uneasy.  Our food was very good!  We started with apps - Spanokopita for me and Greek style chicken wings at our waiter's suggestion for my husband. Very tasty on both accounts and while sized for two, we didn't share. For dinner I ordered the Gyro and my husband the lamb shank dinner. With lamb shank you just never know, but it was literally fall off the bone tender with great flavor and not too fatty.  The dinner also comes with four sides: salad, rice, potatoes, and vegetables...My husband cleaned the plate!  My Gyro had plenty of meat and was tasty when taking a few midnight bites, all I could muster after having eaten a man-sized Spanokopita.  Definitely going back, ordering take-out until patio weather.  About the Groupon...we were told we couldn't use it because it was dinner time on a Saturday night.  No problem!  I feel we received excellent value without it!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! The Gyro was fantastic homemade masterpiece.  Worth the wait!! We will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Chandler needs a good Greek diner...this aint it.  Bar service was not good, how hard is it to be a decent bartender? Gyro was flavorful but lacking in meat and they charged for side-salad without informing it was 3 dollars extra even though they had sign out front saying Gyro for $4.99.  This is why folks won't come back to restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Highly recommended. They are very understanding of gluten allergies and sensitivities as well. My husband and I were very impressed."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Couldn't get past the owner. I asked for my onions to be cooked you would have thought I asked for the moon. We left."}
{"text":"Last night I called Zorba's to see if they deliver.  The gal I spoke with was super sweet and said \"We can do this\" after hearing my location.  I think it was this very gal who hand delivered my food!  She went above and beyond and sweet and sincere too :) THEN I opened my food containers -- so much food for such a small price!  And it was delicious!  I had to put this review up because my 30% tip was not nearly enough for all I received from this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! Food is solid, and the entire staff too. Nice size gyro, but the flaming feta did the trick for us."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe the true flavorful food, value, customer service and experience we had eating at Zorba's. This a DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH you must try. The flaming cheese=AMAZING. The lemon chicken soup=AMAZING. The lamb shank=most AMAZING above all."}
{"text":"First time in this family owed restaurant.  Very nice people and the food was great. The owner took my order and went and made sure they made it right. My to go  ordered  was two gyro pitas and salads, they were very fresh and the taste was amazing."}
{"text":"I hate to have to give such a bad review, but credit where credit is due.  We ate there last night.  There was one table of guests when we arrived.  We seated ourselves and for five minutes we did not see anyone connected with the restaurant.  I finally went back into the kitchen and vocally announced that they have more guests to the kitchen staff who were just standing around talking to one another.  The service from that point on was adequate, but the food was horrid.  We ordered the fried calamari as a starter and it was so tough and chewy we had to sent it back.  It was returned to us marginally more tender.  My wife ordered the Moussaka and it was adequate, not great.  I had ordered pork chops  and was asked what type of sauce I wanted on them.  I responded that I wanted a Greek sauce of their choosing.  What I got was mushroom gravy.  The chops were wafer thin and so overcooked that it was like eating a combat boot.  Tough as could be.  The accompanying veggies were also overcooked, with the exception of the rice.  I came to the conclusion that they must overcook everything, so I didn't bother sending my chops back.  The Greek salad that came with the meal was interesting in that it was made predominantly of Romaine lettuce with a few bits of the usual Greek salad thrown in.  Possibly one of the worst restaurant meals I have ever had.  On the positive side, the place is roomy, very clean and tidy.  The man who waited on us was very nice, friendly and accommodating.  The prices are good.  All in all, though, I can't say we would ever return."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on a whim with just a quick review, and we were very pleased!  The spanikopita was incredible, the gyro was stuffed with meat and their awesome homemade tzaziki sauce, the veggie plate had lots of food including delicious grape leaves.  All the food was great, tasty and flavorful, service was top notch.  Highly recommend, we'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Awesome lamb shank! One of my friends who doesn't usually like lamb also loved it. We had to order it again  for him. I will be the regular customer at this place from now onwards"}
{"text":"Went again for lunch today with my GF.  We had roasted red peppers hummus with pita bread for an appetizer.  She had a large Greek salad with chicken for her lunch, and I had the gyros platter with rice, roasted veggies, and a side salad.  Big, big servings and I think the taste was improved.  The salad dressing was flavorful and my gyros was not dry as the last time.  The pita bread was fresh and very soft.  We had too much to eat and brought a doggie bag home.  We will be back!  The owner was very friendly and accommodating and that makes for a nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"SO RUDE! I went here the other day and the owner of this place is so rude. Terrible service snd mediocre food. No wonder it's always empty"}
{"text":"Food is good. Says they're open until midnight on Saturdays but I just tried walking in at 9:30 and they told me the kitchen was closed. Bogus"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at the reviews I have read here and disagree highly with most of them. I am training for a new job in the area and stopped here on a whim. I had the spanakopita platter and was seriously impressed. I didn't even really think I enjoyed Greek good as much as I now realize I do.   It seems that most of the ppl here are giving negative reviews based on their expectations from a previous owner which I think is kinda silly. I found the food to be delicious and it is also very fresh.   I left with a doggy bag, a full stomach, and a pleased palate. If you haven't been here you should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I ordered online, the total was $44. and some change. I called immediately after placing the order at approx 635pm on 5/12/2018. I confirmed this was delivery which the gentlemen who answered verified with me this was correct. It is now 7:35pm. I just called and stated the delivery driver is not here and it has been an hour, the gentlemen immediately apologized. I knew he messed up,ugh!!! He said it was for pick up only, he gave me the wrong information and my food has been there waiting. This is ridiculous, 1st time i have ever ordered from them, and the last. Super disappointing i spent a lot of money for carry out and i am already disappointed even before i try the food. Bummer."}
{"text":"Server was pleasant, food was good, and we plan to return for the lamb shank."}
{"text":"The best gyro I ever had. The service was wonderful. We also had the zucchini sticks and Greek fries, which were very delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here! The staff was amazingly friendly and funny. The food was great too! The gyro and shawarma was delicious! My son devoured his pizza and my daughter mumbled \"mmmm\" to herself the whole time she ate her spaghetti.   We will definitely be coming back every time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pork chops I have ever had and they were huge. Must have been an inch and a half thick and two of them covered the whole plate. One filled me up and I took the other one home. Next time I'll invite a friend and get one order and ask for an extra plate. It really is enough food for two people."}
{"text":"Im Greek; and this place makes Greek food the way my mother used to make it.  Simple home cooked Greek food; nothing fancy; just some good eating.  This is what Greek home cooked food tastes like. The thing I miss is that none of the Greek restaurants out here serve the loaves of freah baked sesame seed Greek bread like the Greek restuarants in Chicago do.  They all give you pita instead.  Not sure why that is; but to me, a Greek dinner is not complete unless you eat lots of bread along with your meal."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Zorba's.  We ordered take out and the food was very disappointing.  My fries were not fried thoroughly and our chicken was very bland.  My coworker said his shawarma had too much cinnamon in it.  I don't think we will be trying Zorba's again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend last week.  I had heard good things about this place and being very hungry for Mediterranean food, I decided I needed to try it. If you want authentic, freshly made, honest to goodness home made food, this is the place.  I had the gyro platter and it did not disappoint.  I over-ate and still took home half which ended up being lunch for my husband AND me the next day!  The meat was delicious, well seasoned; the rice was excellent and the salad was fresh, tossed with OO and lemon juice with salt, truly the Mediterranean way to dress a salad. I truly enjoyed the food.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This place has good food but last time I come here!! The owner is extremely rude when it comes to using Groupon. He literally called me out with other customers around about using one. He was accusing me of using one a few weeks back which I hadn't even been there for months. Bad attitude, bad business practice = no customers."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, bartender great... since Yelp will not post a short review and has ruined this first time post experience....blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.. maybe it will post now... bottom line, good Greek food"}
{"text":"What the Falafel?? 5 stars for the service/ 5 stars for the making my taste buds poplock!! If zorbas was a Gremlin, it would be \"Cochino Stripe\": because its the baddest one out there. Small in stature,dddgg yet just an absolute monster of flavor. My usual is the hummus trifecta (jalapeno, garlic, and pesto) but today I stepped out of m comfort zone and tried the Stanakopita and I'm an instant fanboy !! The owner greets me as if he's known me for the past 10 years every time I stop by (and I don't even spend that much money there)."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food.  The most tasteless Tiziaki  have ever had The gyro was very blah also nothing to brag about what so ever. Salad was ok . Sad I was looking froward to some good food.  It was clean and our sever was nice ."}
{"text":"Used to love this place when run by former owners. Have visited a few times under new ownership--it's definitely different, menu has changed, but happy to say that the food is still good. We thought the new outdoor patio was nice, and the dining room remodel, opening up the room, was a good idea.  Our recent meal was chicken kabobs and falafel. Both were delicious. Sadly, no room for dessert!  I encourage everyone to give them a try! Rated a 3 because it's a different menu that we still need to investigate."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, so so for dinner. Giros are superb, which I had for lunch. Lamb shank was good but it was cold and seemed it could have been frozen at one point."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super friendly, Food is great and price is competitive. He just needs the world to know and come on in so he can do a refresh and make it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was driving around last week when I decided I needed to try some authentic Greek food. For years, I have loved gyros, but anybody can make a gyro so I wanted something new. I figured there had to be a decent greek restaurant near and there was indeed, Zorba's Greek Cafe. I drove over, and everything about the place looked good: there were luxury cars parked in the parking lot (the rich tend to be picky), there was greek decor, and the lunch prices were low. My day went from good to even better! The menu was surprisingly extensive. They had authentic Greek food and almost any other food you could eat (in case you have a picky friend). After much review of the extensive menu, I decided on the Beef Shawarma, a gyro like pita with marinated beef, Tzatziki sauce, Feta cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes, and a greek salad on the side. The Shawarma was served hot, wrapped in tin foil so none of the meat falls out, and it was eye candy to say the least. As I took a bite, I knew I made the right decision choosing Zorba's for lunch. The meat was juicy and tender, the Tzatziki sauce was definitely homemade, and the Feta was fresh. Not only was the Shawarma great, but so was the Greek salad. All of the vegetables were fresh, which is not the case for many restaurants, and it was a great, light choice of a side. I cannot wait to try more food next time! If you want some authentic greek food and you are not in the mood to cook, Zorba's is your destination. The food is more than satisfactory. However, make sure that you are not in a time crunch. The service was not any too fast. When I arrived, the place was relatively busy, but by the time I ready to leave, there was nobody else in the restaurant. It took the waitress 10 minutes to come take my dishes and ask if I was ready for my check; then, I had to wait even longer to get my debit card back. This being said, the staff I came in contact with was very pleasant. Zorba's  service was definitely their weakness,but I will return because the food is worth while!"}
{"text":"Wow.   Great food and service.   Seriously the best fries i have ever had.   Excellent pita as well."}
{"text":"Looking for good food for lunch and saw this Greek cafe next to furniture store. The food was delicious. We tried the red pepper hummus appetizer and it was fantastic. We both had gyros  which were stuffed with meat. Prices are super reasonable. The waitress that served us had a very funny sarcastic type of humor. Good food and good service. If your a fan of Greek food give this place a shot. Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Yes steve it's the same place.  Trust me, but I have called direct both time I ordered.  I have not used that service...but will try it if they do multiple restaurants.   Ask your chef if he's ever made a delivery?  It happened prior to The date of me writing my review. I use yelp 95% of the time to find our restaurants and I made sure that I write reviews for the proper restaurants.  I've always asked to speak to the owner, if you are the owner I would ask that we try to connect because your food the first time was outstanding. You can see that from my first review that my wife did."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner.   Was the only diner in the restaurant at the time.  Ordered the Gryo dinner.   First came the Greek dinner salad. And I have to say it was the freshest salad I've had anywhere in quite some time. Great color and freshness of the lettuce, peppers, onions, and feta cheese crumbled on top.  The Gryro plate was HUGE. Tons of food.  Great gyros piled on a really fluffy pita. Served with rice and two roasted lemon-y potatoes.  The only thing that didn't thrill me was the green beans and carrots with pine nuts. Pretty mushy and blah.  It's a very small place with only a few tables and a bar off to the side. The usual posters of Greece adorn the walls.  The service was top notch. Many refills on my soda. Which is great.  For the money I paid thought it was a good value. If I'm in the neighborhood again and have a hankering for Greek food I'll probably stop in.  Did I mention the salad was REALLY good? :-)"}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  They have signs announcing a \"new chef\".  I have no idea how good the old chef was.  So I can't compare.  When we arrived the staff was very friendly and attentive.  We were seated and spent some time on the menu.  Curiously there were several Italian dishes there.  Why would you come to a Greek restaurant for Italian food?  Well, we skipped that bit.  We settled on the dolmades (appetizer), lemon chicken, and chicken shawarma.  We were offered some pita bread as well, but beware that they charge for it.  They did not make that clear when they asked us.  The dolmades were very nice.  A little bit of the tzatziki really enhanced the flavor.  The shawarma was good.  Similar to what I've had elsewhere.  The saffroned rice was good too.  The lemon chicken is not something I had ever seen on a Greek menu before, and that is partly why I ordered it.  It was very nice.  Something different with a good flavor.  Usually we don't get dessert, but this time we opted for baklava.  It was very flaky and tasty.  I tend to like sweeter, more chocolaty desserts, but this was good.  I'm comfortable giving them four stars.  Granted this is after only one visit, but it was a good visit even with the stealth charging for the pita bread, and an issue with fans I won't get into (apparently they're either all on or all off)."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 starts I would. Took a break from studying at the coffee shop down way and through I would drop by here and get a late lunch even found an awesome Groupon deal. The guy in there I'm guessing the manger said we don't take that on Friday or Saturday yet his Groupon doesn't mention it just use within 30 days. You can just make up the rules when you want without putting it in writing. It's the quickest way to lose your customers no matter how good your food may be.  Never will I come to this spot again and I'm getting a refund for the money I spent (only $5). Not worth it. I'm big on customer service this place lacks it just based off this one experience."}
{"text":"Worst experience dinning I have ever had. My co workers and I ordered some food using a Groupon. I had a list of what everyone wanted. When I went to go pick up the food the the person who greeted me (I think the owner) was nice until I told him I was using a Groupon. Suddenly his mood changed. He took my phone from me and starting cursing an mumbling under his breath. I asked him is everything okay and he just stared at me and said we can't make money off these fucking things!!!  I could see that the other patrons (a couple and a family of four) were getting a little uncomfortable, as was I. He then gave me my phone back and asked for my card to pay for the rest. It didn't feel right and he didn't even show me the bill. So I asked to see it and it showed that he charged us for something my coworkers and I did not request or want to pay for. I informed him of this politely and he stormed off to the kitchen and cursed and then threw something at the wall and counter. 2 mins later a woman came out and apologized and gave us the correct food. The person I think owner came out from the back to berate me again and then I simply said. You're being rude to me for no reason and you're making your customers very uneasy and I will never come back here. Have a nice day. I don't normally write reviews but his one needs to be written. The person who was rude to us will experience karma someday due to his behavior 10 fold. This is the condensed nice version of what happened."}
{"text":"Great Food! They are one of the best Greek food in AZ. I ordered cheese fries and the ground beef plate it all taste amazing. Will definitely dine in next time instead of order online."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I don't know where to start. If you want excellent service, abundant smiles, comfortable dining, a ton of delicious appetizers, clean atmosphere, then dine here ! I absolutely loved it! It is great food and service ! I will be going back for more !!!!!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous meal! Quality food. Perfect price point. Busy Friday night. We will return. Can't wait"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would.   This place was awesome! The food was amazing, the chef was super kind and I will go here again in a heartbeat. We ordered the chicken plate and the gyro plate and it's probably the best I've ever had in a restaurant. Not a question, I will definitely visit here again. Also, they are very reasonable for price. Huge plates!!!!"}
{"text":"Great community restaurant!!!  Pretty much donated 90 gyros, salad, and hummus to a local school that was trying to introduce greek food to the kids.  AWESOME!!!!!"}
{"text":"I find the dishes flavorful and service is quick.  Hummus, greek salad, and chicken swarma are tasty.   I get my orders to go.  Busy shopping center, so parking isn't always fun.  It's best to go before or after peak time."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time back here in about 5 years. There's a banner out front that says they have a new chef. All I can say is that I hope they keep her or him because the food was fantastic. We ordered 3 gyro plates. The meat had just the right amount of char, you can tell they carefully shaved it off, let it heat up more, then shaved more. We were greeted by the owner and he sat us. Soon after, a young man with a beautiful head of curls waited on us. Turns out to be the owners son. Greek music played, the patio is set up so cute with lights. When the weather cools, we are most definitely sitting out there. I can't believe we waited so long to go back. It's now going to be our weekly spot for dinner. In closing......you're an idiot if you don't order the chicken lemon rice soup. Seriously."}
{"text":"Zorba's has become our date place although it may seem like an unlikely place with it being within the vicinity of a .99 store, a furniture store, and Big Lots. It is quite dark inside and there is only waiter which is the owner, so service can sometimes be slow but she is a very nice lady so I forgive :) Don't expect to waltz on in here and be out in 30 minutes.   I am a vegetarian so there are plenty of options here for me from the hummus, falafel, ziti, manicotti ect. The falafel is quite good I just wished they gave you more of it. Any of their other dishes like the manicotti is quite good. Everything is home made and you can taste the difference. There is a bar on the other side of the restaurant so maybe if you prefer to eat at the bar you can.   My boyfriend always comments that the lamb shank is very tender and well seasoned and cooked. His lemon roasted potatoes were to die for, I tried them and then I went home and recreated the same thing I love it so much. It also comes with rice which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. At the end of the meal we usually have baklava which is a piece of heaven after a satisfactorily meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food and the owner! Fantastic treatment, and amazing food! We were only in AZ for five days but went there for dinner twice! If you like lamb, make sure to order the lamb shank, it's so tasty and tender, I'm wanting it again now!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was fantastic. We ordered our food online for pick-up. Everything was hot and ready, and the person who helped me in the restaurant walked with me to hold open the door. We ordered the chicken shwarma, gyro, and baklava. I had no idea the food came with salad, which was a nice surprise. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and flavorful. The service was attentive and eager.  I will definitely go back and bring the family next time. This is my new go-to place for Mediterranean food. Best place I've found in the valley."}
{"text":"Ok. Would love to review the food but we didn't have any. High hopes for the \"new\" Zorbas - we are within walking distance. Went tonight for a drink and some food. Friday at 5pm. Walked in. One table - who had food and one person sitting at the bar with a soft drink. Sat at the bar, lady brought us menus but didn't ask if we wanted a drink, just left. Five minutes later table two came in and she gave them menus, took their orders, gave them soft drinks and we just sat there. After about 15 minutes of just sitting at the bar with nothing she finally came over. I asked a couple questions about their liquor choices and she grinned and said, \"I don't know how to make drinks. The bartender should be here soon\". Seriously, it's Friday night. Plus she just laughed. Not a good way to encourage me to come back. They may have redone the decor but the service sucks. Too many good places to go on a Friday night after a long work week to just sit and stare at the wall. If you don't want to serve drinks, don't have a bar!"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week.  It's tasty and it's very easy to eat healthy if you want to.  The food is legit Greek.  Sometimes when you are there, you will be the only one not speaking Greek.  The owners are from the old country and so are a lot of the customers.  There is only one waitress, the wife owner, so once in a while, they get backed up.  Usually though, she does an amazing job of keeping up.  If you are looking for a place to frequent where \"everyone knows your name, \" this is it.  (There is also a separate bar which has the same feel.) It is definitely a hidden Gem as many of the other reviewers have said."}
{"text":"Haven't had a good gyro in a while and this was the place for one. We got it to go and even by the time we got home it was still great. I would have no hesitations to come back here when I get a craving for a gyro. Everyone was super friendly and very helpful to!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! You HAVE to try the cheese on fire! They light cheese on fire at your table and you dip warm pita into it, mmm! The gyro plate was enough food to share with my boyfriend and be full also! We arrived at 7pm for dinner time for a friend's birthday party. Great for groups! Authentic Greek food with Greek servers. Our server was hilarious and recommended delicious food and made my friend's birthday dinner very enjoyable. Their menu is so affordable and diverse! They also serve Greek coffee in cute fancy coffee cups! :) ...great to hang out with friends & bring dates!"}
{"text":"This little place seems to be a hidden gem.  And by hidden, I mean that there was nobody there when I went so I assume that noone can find it.  Either that...or people have found it and deemed it unedible....oops, that's not a word...how about inedible.  Granted, I was doing a late lunch...around 1:30pm, but usually if a place is good you have a few stragglers.    So, when I entered the joint it was a bit weird because there was nobody in there...no...I'm not talking about customers...I mean nobody...no host, waiter, straggler, vagrant...nobody.  It turns out that theres a connected bar through a doorway.  So I meandered into the bar and there were a couple of ladies sitting at the bar, they honestly looked surprised that someone wandered into their establishment.  Needless to say, I was very worried about the epicureal experience that I was about to embark on.  Not to mention that the place seemed a bit dingy, and I'm a stickler about eating in clean surroundings.  But I always say that I'll try anything once (provided that I don't read any scathing health inspections beforehand).  I've gotta say that I was very pleasantly surprised with the food.  I ordered the standard by which I judge Greek food, a Gyro.  The meal came with a Greek salad with feta and some garlicky potato things.  A fresh salad is a pretty tough thing to pull off, for many establishments, but this salad was fantastic.  All the ingredients and the veggies were very fresh, and the feta cheese was delicious.  You know how at so many places you get slightly brown iceberg lettuce with so little nutritional content that you'd be better off eating scraps of paper?  This salad was not in that category.  The Gyro was great too, it arrived at the perfect temperature and the pita was warm and soft.  The meat was flavorful, as was the tzatziki.  The potato thingies seemed like they had flavor potential, but were a tad rubbery so I didn't finish them.    The whole meal was around 7 bucks, and it was alot of food, definitely a good deal for the poor and hungry.  This place definitely surprised me.  I almost feel like I lucked out and perhaps the next time I go, I'll have a bad experience.  I'll give it another shot soon...(crossing fingers)"}
{"text":"I agree with all the low rating reviews of the place, that the driver of the low ratings is the rude and quite frankly mean owner (or who appears to be the owner). I visited for a quick takeout lunch alone on a groupon that I had almost forgotten about. He shamed me for ordering only one dish stating that he would never have taken such a business. I was very confused as he was seemingly pleasant until I mentioned that I had a Groupon and I wouldn't think that I need to be ordering 2 dishes for just me. I checked on my way out to ensure that I was not missing any fine prints and I did not. I would suggest that if he has certain expectations, then include them in the prints, can't read his mind. Sounds like he treats all customers trying to use vouchers badly, in which case, he should truly not participate in any of them, not a great way to win new customers. It's not like the customers using the vouchers did not pay for the vouchers, I at best probably had about 4 dollars off the Groupon and cannot tolerate such rude behaviors for a few dollars off. As noted by other reviewers, he was on and off. After shaming me, he skipped to a group in the table turning on friendly owner persona. Food was ok, not the best or the worst Greek I have had. I don't plan to ever come back to this restaurant, life is too short to go through an unHappy meal."}
{"text":"Lamb shanks are awesome, and the person helping us was friendly kind of hard for me to understand what he was saying. But friendly for sure. I visited this place once and tried the lamb shanks, my girl tried some veggie dish which was alright."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a date night and wanted to try something different. We had appetizer, entr√©e, and dessert It was excellent. The food was excellent will definitely be coming back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was not my favorite place. Food did not taste like fresh vibrant food which is what I like about Greek food. I was excited they had flaming cheese but it was not good. Just an oily mess."}
{"text":"Just got lunch from Zorba's today and I'll be back.  I got mine delivered thru UberEats, so I'm not sure how the staff is, but the food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken souvlaki pita and an order of hummus.  The chicken souvlaki was great. The chicken is nicely seasoned, and I got 4 big hunks of tender, juicy chicken in my pita. My only gripe with it is that there wasn't enough! I ran out of chicken 2/3rds of the way through/  The hummus was great as well. One of the better hummus orders I've had lately, in fact. But, maybe it's just my order, but it was served pretty cold. Like, it just came out of the fridge cold, even after 15 minute delivery. Also, I only got one piece of pita with my order, which wasn't near enough for the amount of hummus I got (which was plenty!).  Overall, the food was very good, I just wish there was more of it! And, come on, that's not a bad thing!!"}
{"text":"We were using Yelp to find a good Indian restaurant which happened to be closed. We saw this place a few doors down and decided to eat there as we were hungry.   Service was great, the lady that worked there was helping keep our kids on track. Started with the hummus plate. The pita bread was great and the hummus was excellent.  We both had the Gyros. They were also excellent.   While we were waiting for our food my wife saw that the lemon potatoes were a hit on Yelp, so we got a side order of them and couldn't agree more. The place was dead, which was a shame. If we lived in Phoenix we would eat here often."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick bite to eat. Came here after work to take home a gyro. Have to say, one of the better gyros I've had around this area. They PACK on the meat which is always a winner in my book. The shawarma was well seasoned - not just plain like a majority of places - it actually tasted like they gave it they're own love. Tzatziki was  a tiny bit thick for my taste, but I'm not bothered by that. Overall, a great place to grab a quick Greek meal."}
{"text":"We went to Zorba's for dinner the other night.  We were the only ones in the restaurant (tuesday before thanksgiving).  We had both the chicken and beef souvlaki with hummus, rice and tzatziki with a salad and Greek fries (with feta cheese olive oil).  Service was great... We got to talk to the owner who was nice and very entertaining.  Great local restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Very mixed emotions about Zorba's.  We used a Local Flavor coupon.  The restaurant/bar is dated and not fancy.  On Friday night (at 6PM), they have a local band blasting music through the place.  The band itself was pretty good, but the volume made it impossible to talk or to think. Service was quick and efficient (I think the server was polite; however could not hear him, due to the music volume).  The food was a bit different than what we expected: avogolemono soup was actually chicken broth with lemon juice in it, not creamy soup as anticipated, Greek salad was good, however the \"dressing\" was vinegar and nothing else.  Gyros platter was huge and meat was tender.  However the deal-breaker: flies flying all over the place.  I can deal with old furnishings and loud music, but I cannot eat in a place while swatting flies.  I don't think I will be able to forget about the flies and return."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times in 2006 and enjoyed the Greek salads and galaktoboureka.  Lamb shank dinner didn't impress us much, and the homous left us pining for Pita Jungle's and Sabuddy's.  Seeing a roach in the restroom made me decide to stop going there.  I decided I'd give Zorba another try tonight when I wasn't able to find Priya, an Indian restaurant in Tempe I've been told by a few to check out.  The menu on the door was tantalizing enough for me to sit down.  If I order apps and an entree, I usually have both choices ready by the time the server asks for my app order (I normally skip the app and order an entree, or just have an app as my entree).  This time, I decided I'd order the app first while I decide on the entree.  There certainly were many that caught my eye, but after observing the host/owner's interactions with other customers and overhearing her speak with a customer on the phone, I lost my desire to spend more time there.  No doubt, much of the negative vibes I felt were probably due to her being tired (her body language certainly showed me that she's had a taxing day) and also just the way she speaks (I work w/ many multi-nationals and so get to study them a bit); I still felt like wanting to bolt, so I decided I'd just have the kalamaria and go to another restaurant for some veggies.  Zorba's version of calamari (there didn't seem to be a batter used, but mouth-feel revealed a batter coating of some kind) is definitely different from Italian calamari, where the squid is dipped in a batter that renders them light and crispy, but I quite enjoyed the dish.  It came with sliced red onions garnished on top and tzaziki sauce (cucumber-laced yogurt) on the side, which had a fresh and enticing aroma, but I've an allergy to cukes and I usually just keep it simple with just fresh lemon juice anyway.  My fave calamari pieces are the tentacles, and Zorba's was skimpy on them in this dish (five pieces max).    I'll give this place another try during lunch, since I recall that the owner used to be very friendly before; Perhaps she'll be in better spirits when encountered earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot in Chandler. Awesome and friendly service, delicious food and the price is unbeatable. Gyro for like 5 bucks is always my \"go-to.\" I just left and they've spruced up the patio with some decorative lighting and comfy patio seats, perfect place to read a book or chill with some tea. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a healthier alternative to what most restraunts in the area offer. Definitely try it! The owner is extremely nice and out going and is always checking to see how everything is throughout your meal. I usually leave with a smile and a full stomach for like $10.00..  Michael T.... You sound like a drama queen..."}
{"text":"Great greek food!  The salad is fresh and a generous portion.  We've tried the flatbread and were surprised by the great flavor.  The staff is always welcoming and off great service.  This location is far from our place, but we make the drive for the gyro!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to real good Greek food and what I got was just ok. Service was fine, in fact we thought they were closed because there were only 2 other customers at the bar. The portion size and service was acceptable but the food was forgettable. I won't be returning. If you want really good Mediterranean food go to Phoenicia in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunchtime! My office is in the area so it's a nice place to relax & grab a lunchtime entree. They have various Gyro specials that are decently priced around $8.00. Their combination plates are more for dinner due to portion size & price. I enjoy the chicken souvlaki gyro with a side salad. I must say, the manager that works there during the day is kind and will always make you feel welcome. He's one of the reasons I keep going back. I enjoy an atmosphere that is customer service oriented and truly appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"This place is assume. The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service. We had a wonderful lunch - gyros and flaming cheese! Stop by!"}
{"text":"Pops and I each ordered the lamb shank and we weren't disappointed. Meat fell off the bone and was delicious. Awesome deal for $12.99....served with rice, grilled veggies, hummus, pita bread and a Greek salad."}
{"text":"Just business.  I came here since I was in the area and haven't had Greek food in such a long time. I was a little early for Saturday and didn't realize they open at noon. So I waited 10-15 minutes. Might as well right?  I went to the door 2 minutes before opening and peered inside to see no one. Then shortly a young lady was opening up shop. I was excited! She handed me a menu. Another customer came in to make a to-go order too and asked how long it might take. Well she informed us that the cook wasn't here yet. The man was in a rush and had to leave. I decided to stay since I already invested 15 minutes waiting.   I told her upfront I had a Groupon for this place. I was told I couldn't do it for to-go orders. So I said I would eat a little there and then take it to go.  I had to spend $10 worth. So I decided to go with the classic gyro and then a chicken shawarma.   I prepaid for the order and pre tipped since I knew I wasn't going to stay long and was waiting for the cook anyway. Tried to kill some time.   I went to use the restroom and came back out to hear some yelling in the kitchen. I didn't really hear what that was about, but it wasn't good by that nasty tone of voice.   Another lady came in solo to dine in for lunch.  She was given a menu.   Few minutes pass by and then a guy comes out and he marched towards me. He started yelling at me saying I am supposed to use this Groupon on one item. I told him I did not know that and that it doesn't specify that on the fine print. He said, \"It doesn't matter. Those rules don't mean shit! I make the rules!\" I said, \"Then you should have told that to Groupon and not me.\"  He proceeded to say that he is only making $2 per sandwich. Not my fault. I already spent $8 on the Groupon. He said, \"I'm not making shit!\" He continued to yell and harass me about what I should have done after the fact that I had already ordered, paid and tipped. I told him, \"You should have told me all of this before I paid for and ordered it!\"   He continues to yell at me some more and say that I need to support small businesses. The young lady hands me my food. She ended up making it to go for me. She was apologetic towards me because she knew that guy was unprofessional.   I finally got out of my seat and grabbed my order to leave. And he says to me, \"Don't take it personal. It's just business!\"   I was NOT happy.   I thanked the young lady for her service. I feel sorry for her having to work with such an unprofessional person.   He was late coming into work. If you're opening a restaurant at noon, you should be coming in before it opens. You need to prep the kitchen. Not 10 minutes after the restaurant opens. If you're going to yell at your coworker or employee, might as well do it in front of your customers. If you're asking me to order only one item, why? I am still spending more than $10 worth whether it's one versus two items. I actually spent more buying two items. I was told he was only making $2 per sandwich. False. After tip and whatever he gets from Groupon that's more than $2. That's a free math lesson I didn't charge for. I get yelled at for your poor decision making. If you want to thrive, don't speak down to your customers. I recommend a business class or few and anger classes.   Remove yourself and allow the young lady to take over the business. That's also free advice.   Don't take this personal. It's just business.   \"Shame. Shame. Shame.\" ~ Cersei"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch to celebrate the closing date of our new home in Chandler. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff were very lovely, attentive people. I ordered the ahi tuna, which is something you don't commonly see on a Greek menu, and it was absolutely delicious and perfect! They are really well-versed about getting the temperature perfect, and the man who served us mentioned that they pay careful attention to the timing. My husband loved the lamb he ordered. The Greek side salads were great, but I think next time I will order a full one because I do love dolmathes and the side ones that come free with the meal don't have them. One of the things I love about this place is that they have a separate outdoor smoker-friendly patio which is far away enough and detached enough from the restaurant, that I can enjoy a cigarette and drink after my meal, without annoying the nonsmokers eating in the restaurant. We had the whole patio to ourselves and I loved it, as I do enjoy eating outside in all different kinds of weather. I will definitely be going again, and hope to make this one of my favorite go-to spots in Chandler for great food and drinks. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"My family ate here at the recommendation of some friends and we were really impressed.  The server we had was extremely friendly and did a great job entertaining our 5 month old daughter. Later finding out after a conversation with my friend that the server was the owner.  The food was absolutely delicious!  I had a chicken dish and my wife had a pasta dish, both meals were delightful. My family will be going back to Zorba's in the near future."}
{"text":"We arrived to a closed restaurant the first time we went, even though it was suppose to be open. We went to try again another day. We had a Groupon and the waiter wasn't too excited and told us we could only order from one part of the menu. That was nowhere written on the Groupon. We ordered and the food was fresh and good. My daughter had the steak shawarma plate. The flavors were very good. The kefta plate was pretty good but not great. The potatoes and vegetable sides were delicious. When we got the bill there was a \"tax s/f\" of $2.74 on the bill and an additional tax charge of $.86. The waiter just said that the first tax was for one plate and the other was for the other plate. So I guess they were charging me 20% for the steak? The food was good but the service fair. Probably won't go back. There are better places to go with great service."}
{"text":"Great food.  Not too fancy but owner was on site and staff was super friendly.  The owe actually served us and helped with suggestions.  Only reason I 4 starred it was we were looking for fancy and this was more laid back, no uniforms, atmosphere needs an update as it looked like an old American diner but very friendly and food was very good none the less.   We did the hummus, flaming cheese, gyro, and a vegetarian platter-no complaints and plenty of food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  I asked the owner (who took our order)  if the lamb was lean before I ordered the lamb souvlaki.  He told me it was as lean as lamb could be.  Needless to say, it was full of fat - not edible.  I told the waitress and she told me I could order something else so I ordered the chicken souvlaki.  The owner is very strange - he tries to be friendly and funny but really is just annoying.  He told me it is impossible to purchase lamb that isn't fatty.  I know that isn't true because I've had terrific lean lamb at many restaurants.  He continued to talk about this every time he checked on our table.  Made me very uncomfortable.  The chicken souvlaki  they brought as a replacement was good.  Side dishes were just fair.  Rice and vegetables were lacking in flavor.  The humus  was very good.  I don't think I will be returning soon as there are excellent Greek restaurants nearby like the Greek Grill (has great lamb)."}
{"text":"I love the greek salads.  They are great.  We go 2 or 3 times a month.  We had fries this week abd they were great.  They come with feta cheese and a sauce that is just perfect."}
{"text":"Tried to use a  Groupon for $10 worth of food during lunch. I ordered a gyro that was $6.99 and a Greek salad $3. They would not accept the Groupon because it was a penny short.  Food was mediocre and cold. Service was slow even though nobody was in there for lunch. I have 3 groupons for the place which I will not use because I will not go back."}
{"text":"Food was really good but it took over an hour to get it.  And we were one of about 4 tables in the whole place.  (So maybe not quite worth the wait, although it was good.)   Owner(?) seemed to be waiting tables and cooking and speaking to customers. Possibly a reason for the significant delay."}
{"text":"A true gem.  If the food wasn't outstanding, then the hospitality of Kenda (sp?) and Sean would've easily compensated. My husband and I were shocked that we'd never been here yet in the 2+ years we've been in the East Valley but we're fortunate to have found them and intend on returning soon!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro ever. Great hummus. Loved this place. Kind wait staff and owner greet you and make you feel welcome. Highly recommend when you have a craving for Greek food."}
{"text":"Great food. The restaurant feels old. I always get my food Togo. I love the pita plate for lunch."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, and will keep going back again and again. It's a no-frills, family owned, authentic Greek restaurant, with amazing food. Pita Jungle might get all the hype, but the food is way better here. Service is always great, and prices are incredible. Big portions of healthy food for cheap prices is why you should go here."}
{"text":"Wonderful environment, great food, and good service.  I had a very late lunch here yesterday, ordered the Gyro Plate that comes with veggies, rice, and a salad.  It was all very delicious! Frankly, I would've been give it a 5 star but the man serving, manager or owner, kept me waiting for my check for about 15 minutes plus.  It got busy so I understand that part but I shouldn't have had to wait that long to pay and leave."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. My husband and I both like the variety on the menu. The atmosphere is also fantastic for a nice dinner out. The owner is magnificent as well. A definite must have for Chandler."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times now and never disappointed. Great food. The lamb shank is our favorite."}
{"text":"Zorba's?  Isn't that the name of a sex shop?  Not like I would know or anything, but I do believe I've seen it somewhere on Scottsdale road.  Perhaps I've even parked in their parking lot, but I swear it was only to dump my car off somewhere so I could get into Sugar Daddy's.    Anyways, this is a great Greek restaurant in Chandler.  I've only been once, but I really liked it.  They call it an authentic restaurant, but since I've never been to Greece, I wouldn't really know.  What I do know is that my hummus was absolutely delish and my falafel was really tasty.  You know how falafel can sometimes be too dry and bland? Not here.  It was a little spicy and really flavorful. Plus, they didn't skimp on the tzatziki.  Well played Zorba's.  Well played.    Now if only they would consider joining forces with the \"other\" Zorba's to create the ultimate sex shop/Greek restaurant combo in the world..."}
{"text":"My husband's new favorite restaurant. The food is delicious. He's especially fond of the lamb shank. But it's the service that will keep us coming back again and again. The owner is so friendly and welcoming. He treats his customers like they're part of the family!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Zorbas for a long time now and used to love it. All of a sudden, it went completely down hill. We sat down and ordered our food pretty quickly. About 45 minutes later, we asked the waiter where our food was. He brought it out a few minutes later and it was both burnt and ice cold. We got up and left. It was ridiculous! Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving Greek hummus and pita, I head over to see Janny at Zorba's.  The hummus is so delicious, just the right balance of flavors and texture and the pita is so fresh you might eat it all before you finish the hummus.  The other food is also awesome too with hearty portion sizes.  Janny also makes avgolemono which is a delicious lemon, chicken and rice soup that warms the soul when the weather is cooler. If you want to feel like you are at a friends kitchen table, stop by and visit Zorba's."}
{"text":"Such delicious food things! Most colorful meal i have had in quite the while! Gr8 live music! Gr8 greek flavo! Gr8 rave lights! PLURRRRRRRRRRR"}
{"text":"Lots of great places to get Greek food in Phoenix. This isn't one of them. Also found out in hindsight from a friend whose child who used to work there but they cheat the wait staff and take all the tips."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly staff. Loved the deluxe gyro hummus! We will definitely eat here again soon!"}
{"text":"I have not been disappointed by anything I have ordered. Great service and fantastic menu. My husband and I keep going back."}
{"text":"The place looks and smells like a pizza joint with a hole-in-the-wall feel. However, the food is very good. Had the huge Gyro Salad. Meat was well cooked and salted and the salad was pretty good. Might have had too much water at the bottom.  The high school band playing that night was a nice touch."}
{"text":"It is a great experience to dine in here.. in twice of our visit, the boss personally visits each table and interacts with the customers.."}
{"text":"First off the bat, the employee was absolutely rude. We had advised him that we are using a Restaurants.com voucher, and the first thing he says they don't take them anymore and haven't for months. When asked why I was able to get the voucher off the website that same day, he accused me of lying. Absolutely disgusting. If you don't want to take vouchers, then take yourselves off the website(s). Pretty simple.  Anyways, they decide to finally honor the voucher and ask us if its to go. Basically saying \"Fine, get your stuff and get out.\" Disgusting as well.  We decide to order the food (though, at this point, I'm scared that they might spit in the food), and get a couple of plates, with a side of Hummus and Tzatizki. The Hummus tasted like it was Sabra's and the Tzatizki was watered down, had no flavor to it.  The Shawarma plate was pretty gross, it took me biting on it more than I would a rubber band in order to be able to digest it.   The Souvlaki and side of Greek Salads were pretty good though, but that is about it.   Don't think I'll stop by here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediteranian food.  very friendly wait staff and kitchen.  nice bar next door, outdoor seating, 4 Peaks on tap, eco-friendly doggie box. Great pita bread, very good humus, fantastic Swarma.  Among the best Calamari."}
{"text":"Very good meal in a small, comfortable restaurant. We started with tasty tzatziki served with warm pita wedges which we gobbled up with a draft beer. My husband had steak souvlaki and I had lamb souvlaki, which were both tender and tasty. We absolutely loved the zucchini and lemon potatoes that were served as sides!    We were here because of a restaurant.com voucher, but will be coming back because of the excellent food and friendly service. There's a small outdoor patio overlooking the parking lot, which might be nice on a warm evening."}
{"text":"I've been to Zorba's and used a Groupon, everything was fine. When I saw another Groupon for Zorba's I bought it and saved it for a time when I would be able to take my younger daughter since she likes gyros. I experienced the same situation as Philip (below review) except the owner decided it was wise to show me the math of deducting $10 from $18 as if I wouldn't understand his dilemma of 'trying to run a business'. I was insulted and will never step foot in Zorba's again.   As a sales and marketing business woman HE should understand how detrimental his ethics are to his business because I will certainly tell everyone I know to avoid his business like the plague."}
{"text":"It's hard to find places during the weekdays that are open past 9 or 10pm and this place is open till 2am !! There menu is not your average Greek food menu. They have a very big variety and you are bound to find something you like. they even have some American and Italian dishes as well. it was just the two of us but we ordered for about 5 people because we wanted to try so many different things. Hummus, eggplant, souvlaki, steak kabobs, even the manicotti. Everything was very good, and they have a large selection in wine and specialty drink also."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.  Service lacking.  Old place so feels dirty.  Food on the other hand was fantastic!  Would not give me the coupon Yelp offered.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Our go to Mediterranean restaurant. Totally family owned and operated, friendly service nice atmosphere. The lamb shank was amazing, prices extremely reasonable. Find it and go and forget the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Living Chandler said they were great and delicious...so I bought the 3 Groupon for ten dollar deal each ..ate at the restaurant had vegetarian plate with falafels, it was pretty good.. 2 more Groupons to go my 2nd time I ordered to go , and I ordered a vegetarian plate again 10.99 Groupon is for anything over 10.00 and he says \"what else do u want\" so I get more stuff to try out..this time falafels old and cold, everything else blah...last Groupon got chicken souvlaki,  it was meh.  Not very tasty....nor was the rice ..the baklava was good but not hot like they serve it, supposed to be room temp..they are ok but I think I'll stick to Pita Heaven..their stuff tastes better ..."}
{"text":"Have been to Zorbas several times over the last month, and the food and service were excellent.  Appetizer plate was superb, and the entree portion was very generous.  Chef Benjamin was very personable and accomodating.  I recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Food arrived hot and that was the best part of the experience. Ordered the beef souvlaki, overly seasoned, tough, and no fat trimmed off. Very small portion. Entree came with rice (perfectly steamed, no seasoning at all), and saut√©ed veggies. Side salad included, cucumbers were bitter.   Also ordered spanikopita, all spinach and hardly any cheese. It was a large portion wrapped in a couple sheets of phyllo.   Paid/wasted $23 before tip and delivery fee. Save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"Thank you for an enjoyable experience, great food and comedic relief!! Gyro was fantastic! Lamb shank good! Hospitality of staff A+"}
{"text":"Excellent Lamb dishes. Every employee made sure you had everything you needed. Wonderful experience. Will definitely regiment to all. Family ran atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great spinAch salad with made fresh for my order, hard boiled egg and crispy bacon. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, service decent but the owner did walk around checking on everyone's meals..did not honor the yelp 100% coupon but that's understandable"}
{"text":"It really is a shame that Yelp only allows one rating. Because Zorba's would be a 4 for the food and maybe a 1 for service. We've been there before and the food is always good, but the service is spotty. Tonight it was abysmal. Maybe they saw the Groupon coupon on the table and figured we weren't worth it??   We ordered a hummus trio appetizer and my husband ordered, very clearly, a cup of lentil soup.  When those came (almost an hour later) it was chicken soup, but who wanted to wait even longer for them to fix that and bring the lentil soup? Not us. The chicken soup wasn't bad, but we prefer the lentil.  Our actual waiter took the orders and (finally) delivered the appetizer and (wrong) soup. He was pretty scarce after that and looked kind of terrified when he brought the hummus. Plates were removed and our entrees were delivered by other people. So, dude, if you wonder why you got a crappy tip it's because you gave us crappy service. (We were able to get one of the other people to finally fill our water glasses.)  When our food finally came, it was delicious. Fine. We ate. As we were nearly finished, the owner/manager made a tangential pass by the table, asking how everything was. I said \"a little slow,\" but he may already have been out of earshot. In any case, he chatted for a good 5 minutes with the people at the next table. And then until we left he was chatting with the patrons at a table across from us... saying \"see you tomorrow\" as we headed out the door. Yeah. I don't think so, buddy. There are plenty of places where we can get decent Greek and/or Middle Eastern food - and much better service."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE DESERVES A BIG FAT ZERO! We scheduled to have our banquet there 2 months before. I checked in with them 1 month before and again at 2 weeks before. Tried to give them a head count 4 days before and their phone was disconnected! Tried for several days and finally 2 days before our event, I was able to get in touch with them. I was asked to come later because they had booked another party! We had to call all 70 guests and cancel our meeting because of them. Horribly handled!!"}
{"text":"Found my new Greek food home on the east valley. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was nice. When we entered there was only one other couple which is scary to me but the quality if the food to those fears to rest. I'll be back."}
{"text":"As usual their food and service is on point. The wife is the chef and she's fabulous.  Interior needs an upgrade but the food makes it amazing."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Zorba's around 6pm on a Sunday evening we were disappointed to find a sign that said they were closed on Sundays. Then much to our surprise, a person cleaning inside, who happened to be the owner, welcomed us in and opened up the shop for us.   We started with the fried zucchini and hummus which were both delicious. Then we moved to onto a gyro wrap for myself and a great salad for my companion. The gyro meat was juicy and delicious, not the usual, dried out and chewy meat I've suffered through elsewhere. The veggies were all fresh and the portions were great.   By the time we left, more than half the retaurant was filled despite them \"not being open on Sunday.\"  And while I will say that the food is good, the real reason for the five here is the service. The owner was incredibly friendly, forthcoming, and seemed so happy to serve us even on a day that was technically his day off. I wish I lived in the area to visit it again but since I don't, I encourage you to visit it for me :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food! Best gyros in the valley! Best meats! Best pesto hummas and pitas! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Gotta say not excellent :(  And the owner turns it on and off.  Not a pleasant man, kinda whiny about the business, his costs, etc.  Then when he moves towards a table he's all happy and friendly.  Food was ok, not great as I had hoped."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience!!! First of all they have a sign outside saying two dollar kiltlifter's for happy hour and when I get in and ask about it he says they are three. So I decide to order one he fills the small sized glass beer with the whole top half as foam! So then I order hummus and meatballs ...Hummus comes out first and it's teeny and I get about halfway through and realize there's something whitish and it it looks like either spit or mold! Then the meatballs come out and just to look at them I could tell they were about a month old! I take a bite and want to spit it out but decide not to but push them to the side. He asked me what's wrong and I tell him that I believe they're super old so he grabs one tears it in half and begins to chew and says what's wrong I said they're dry and he agreed. He said he would fix it but I told him not to and grab my bill when he goes to the back and he's gone for a while so I leave some cash on the table and get the heck out of there! What a waste I hope I don't get sick!!"}
{"text":"We came from Ca and we where looking for a place to eat...after walking in out and out of 3 other places and i am glad we di...this is one Awesome place to eat!...The food is excellent and tasty...the owner was super nice and met all our needs...if we lived out here, we would be regulars!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place isn't packed for dinner. I think the location is a little unfortunate and at first when we walked in and saw we were the only ones in there, I was a little nervous, but was quickly put at ease when I started talking to the owner.  I had to show off my Greek skills a little bit so we starting chatting in Greek and she went on how everything there was prepared by her personally, just like she would make for herself at home.  She wasn't kidding! The saganaki was to die for! The cheese wasn't too sharp, just the right about of brandy, and the pita was so soft and warm. She gave us a little scare though when she lit the saganaki AFTER it was on the table (typically that's done while they're holding it away from you to prevent any singed eyebrows - so watch out!)  The salad was fantastic, fresh veggies, the right about of feta, the dressing was not overwhelming.  My husband ordered the chicken souvlaki, my father-in-law ordered the beef souvlaki (surprised there is no pork option!) and I had the gyros platter. The lemon potatoes were just like my mom's if not better, the rice was great, and the meat across all three were decent.  We split a baklava and galactobourito for dessert, all homemade as well. I always found both to be overly sweet for my taste, but they really were prepared quite well - not too heavy or syrupy.  All that paired with a friendly host.  Will definitely be going back and as a Greek girl, I'll say, that at least for this experience, it was just like a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome Greek food!  Went here to grab takeout for dinner one evening the other week.  I ordered the standard gyro (played it safe for my first time here), which comes with roasted potatoes and rice on the side as well as a Greek salad.  The value alone is great--my entire dinner was $10 plus tip.  The Greek salad had plenty of tomatoes, cucumbers and feta.  I judge my Greek salads by the amount of feta (the more the better) and this salad did not disappoint.  It was also pretty substantial for a side salad.  My gyro, potatoes and rice were equally impressive.  Everything was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection.  My only suggestion would be to ask for and extra side of tzatziki sauce for the gyro if you're a big fan of the stuff.  I tend to use a lot of tzatziki sauce, and would have been happier with a little more.    Again, this place was great and I will most certainly be back to try other entrees!  Don't let the location scare you away.  It's well worth your time."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is delicious and the price is very reasonable. What I like most though is the way the staff treats my significant other and I each visit. They are so polite, always check in multiple times to ensure we are enjoying our experience, and they really care about the food and service they're providing. The most recent time I visited, we had just paid the bill when I said that I wasn't feeling well. One of the people there, I think the owner, offered to make a cold remedy for me. How caring! On top of it all, they always have their Everclean grade posted. It's always an A so you know your food is handled well too!"}
{"text":"Decent Greek food and then some American/Italian/Greek inventions.  Service is a bit slow but they do make everything to order. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd with a tiny bar on the side which always seems to attract a crowd.  The owner lady seems very mad all the time but she's very efficient and polite so what if she won't smile?"}
