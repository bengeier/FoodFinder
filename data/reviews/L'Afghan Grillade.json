{"text":"My very first time trying Afghan food today. This place has their original location on L'Acadie and which I've read good reviews about but as usual, laziness sometimes gets the best part of me in life so hello postponement.   Fortunately, they just recently opened up their doors here in Laval and right on my daily commute path. I gotta say they did a good job attracting people from the outside of the restaurant with their chic decor and enough lighting to grab your attention. Specially with that big \"Halal\" neon sign in your face. I dunno, mixing religion with anything else is really not my thing plus stating the obvious like a peacock? I personally don't like that no matter what religion it is. Each to his own, keep your faith in your heart and to yourself please. Does the general public need these things shown off, flaunted and make the rest of us the none halal people feel alienated or welcomed in your establishment? Specially on businesses which their sole purpose is making money! My reaction: shaking my head..... then sticking with the main subject: Whatever, take my money. Where's the food?   Back to the main topic. One word: Very good! I was hesitant between the Herath kebab and Mantou. Went with the first one only to test the quality/taste of the beef and chicken since both come on the same plate. Very nice choice. Good marinade, good taste and cotton soft meat all with a reasonable price and ample portion.   I am definitely coming back here and trying their other awesome looking dishes. I have a feeling they're as good if not better than what I just had. The place is very clean, simple yet trendy, flavours of the east and west mixed well all over the place and then topped with good background Afghani music that matches the food cooked on charcoal you're consuming.   Good job and wish them success at this difficult corner of this street. Lots of other businesses before them had come, tried and failed, many times that I've lost count. I'm bored seeing that kind of unpleasantness. Hope they'll stay here for a long time, prosper and become a permanent fixture. Good luck!"}
{"text":"The food is really good there! Bought a chicken burger and was happy by how the chicken was crispy and fresh! Would come there again and again!"}
{"text":"Memories of food can linger on for years and years.  It was January 1st 2005 and I don't remember exactly where I was (Queens or Bronx and still a bit out of it from the night before), I finally had Afghan food for the 1st time.   What I remember the most is the flavorful rice, 3 colors of rice and the delish kebabs.   I've been on the lookout for that since then here to no success. Our Afghan selection very limited here.  When I passed by the Marché Central area, I saw a new addition to the admittedly crowded restaurant field.  I had to try it and it delivered plenty of memories.   The kofta kebab was Persian style but lacked the flavor I found from my usual faves like Kebab Sera.  The filet mignon was delicious but only 4 pieces. There was a large salad with a creamy dill dressing but the higlight again was the rice.  Half a large plate might seem like overkill but every bite was perfect. Large basmati grain with an indecipherable taste. You just have to try it.  The plates are about $13 to $15 and I waited about 20 minutes evenduring lunch even though the place was empty. In an area where workers don't have much time or money it might be best to order ahead and get the daily specials for $10 with a drink.  I have to mention the decor and scale of the place, it is gigantic compared to the shish taouk places that dot the city so it's worth it to eat in. There seem to be a reserved section where you can eat on the carpets as well as a terrace.  And did I mention Glass Bottled Pepsi made with real sugar.  I will definitely go back and see if what else to try, I really want to give it my hard to achieve 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place deserves an extra half star but since that isn't an option, it's a little closer to a 3 star vs a 4 star for me. This is a new restaurant located across the street from Marche Centrale. What drew me in to try it, was the very pretty and inviting exterior, the interior doesn't disappoint and is a rarity for such a pretty place with a low priced menu, the most expensive meal costing $14.95!   The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and spotless, very impressive. The decor is well thought out and I think they must have the nicest bathrooms I have ever seen in a restaurant. It isn't a full service restaurant, but more of a food court ordering system. You order at the counter and are given a round pager that buzzes when your food is ready for pick up on a red, cafeteria style tray. The staff is very nice and friendly, and were great at answering questions about the food and menu.   As always, my husband and I ordered a bunch of different items to try. The Hearath kabab plate comes with rice and salad, a chicken brochette and a filet mignon brochette, the chicken was spiced really well with a tiny kick of heat, and grilled perfectly. The filet mignon I was less fond of, not that it was bad, I just expected more but my husband did enjoy it. The rice was good, and the salad was your standard green salad with a creamy dressing.   The freshly baked Afghani bread and dipping sauces were a nice addition. We also had the badenjan (eggplant dish) which was good but the bitterness from the eggplant peel was more pronounced than I would have expected. The mantou was delicious, that and the chicken brochette were my fave aspects of the meal. With a few simple tweaks for the food, this place would easily go over a 4 star for me, I'll be returning for sure to try some other dishes.   I should also mention that this restaurant is kid friendly, they have high chairs and a change table in the bathroom. The staff is also very attentive with children, that alone is enough to have me come back!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude manager. Elle était vraiment arrogante et n'a aucun respect pour les clients. Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant du tout!"}
{"text":"This place is terribly disappointing. I went here this week to break my fast after a long day of moving. Since it was Ramadan, parking was difficult to find. Luckily I grabbed a spot around the corner on the street. When we entered, many people were lining up for the buffet, offered especially for Ramadan. I went to check it out, they had some red boneless chicken pieces mixed with French fries, white soup, sabzi, rice, salad and some other kind of gravy dish with naan and a red drink. Honestly, the buffet was running low and didn't seem that appealing so we decided to order off the menu. Since it was our first time, I asked the woman what she would recommend, and she moved us to order the Bamyan kebab plate and the Herath plate. We wanted to order a lamb dish but they were sold out. After looking around for a seat, we only found a few empty tables with reserved signs on them. We decided to sit down at one anyways since there were no more seats. We waited, and waited and waited for what seemed like forever. Keep in mind, we were fasting all day and not offered anything, no dates, no water. We took out our own water to break our fast and waited over 20 minutes before I went back to the counter to inquire about our food. Everyone around us, everyone in the restaurant had food except us. She told us it would be another 5 minutes and after another 10 minutes, 30 minutes waiting for food in total, we finally got our plates. She charged us extra for some mediocre fries and the filet mignon was too chewy to eat. Th chicken was unremarkable and honestly the entire experience was underwhelming at BEST. Overall the food was very bland and the service was horrendous. I don't think I'll ever be back here."}
{"text":"we go there for supper on a friday night the only experience i can tell is the food was not cook well so much that both me and my wife got sick once we got home suffering from food poisening and past then night whit are head in the toilet  so even if you like this kind of food i reccoment to check if it cook well  ok the rice was good at least they got that right"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good if you're looking to splurge $30-$40 between two people that just consists of the main meal, without appetizers and with/without drinks depending on how expensive your main meal dish is. They have a variety of afghan meats from chicken, beef including filet mignon, lamb (e.g. lamb chops), etc.   The food quality grade for this price meets expectations, nothing more or less. However, the flavours are well balanced with the rice and salad. Salad is more on the tangy side, rice is more on the basic afghan scale and the meats are well seasoned and grilled to perfection.   Not crazy about their red hot sauce (tastes like average hot sauce you buy at the local grocery store), green mint sauce is good, however what is disappointing is they don't have white sauce. Being a New Yorker, the afghan restaurants in NYC all have complimentary white sauce which is the sauce that puts the entire dish together, but maybe, it's not common in Montreal.   Anyways, I would still choose the afghan places in Toronto and NYC over Montreal, but this one does live to its expectations if you've never tried the afghan food in Toronto and NYC.   I took some pictures of the decor and the bathroom sink in case if anyone is interested in that... ?"}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful experience here!! This is more of a fast food resto. It is quite large. They have a reserve area, where you can sit and eat your meal the traditional Persian way. However you have to reserve that area in advance. For the remainder of the resto, it's regular tables and chairs. You have to make your order at the counter, and then you can pick up your trays once the buzzer rings. This was our first time here and it was a great. The staff are amazing! We even got complimentary entree because it was our first time. All the meat was well seasoned and cooked. We found there was a lot of rice and not enough veggies to go along. They also have a display where you have traditional Persian artifacts."}
{"text":"Good service, the food quality is good. I recommend trying the Herat chicken. The place is clean. You can call before coming to get your order faster. Good place to go in the weekend ."}
{"text":"Grand local chic pour un fast food afghan c'est pratique, bcp de tables, la bouffe correct, salle pour la priere et pour se detendre avant et apres le repas ainsi qu'une salle de lavage pour l'ablution :)"}
