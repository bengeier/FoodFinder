{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sat afternoon.  Ordered the chicken and beef (2 for 6.99).  Panini grill gave a nice crispy finish, especially considering we took the shawarmas home and ate them 15mins after they were made.  Guy behind the counter could have given more love to spreading the hummus on the pita.  Surprisingly good taste given appearance of ingredients (didn't look very fresh)."}
{"text":"Shawarmas.  I can't ever think of a time when I've had one that I didn't at least mildly enjoy.  It's just a really solid food item, often overlooked by the foodies.  The shawarms at this place are pretty fantastic, let's dig a little deeper.

+++PROS+++
1. It is damned good!
2. Dirt cheap.  Two shawarms for $6.99.  That's a bargain folks.
3. Selection includes lamb, nice.  They also have a spicy beef version.
4. Everything is fresh
5. The workers (a couple I presume) are super friendly, despite working like dogs during the lunch hour.  I think they deserve some sort of prize for this.
6. I like it when people address me as \"my friend,\" it really makes me feel at ease
 
---CONS---
1. It's in Scarberia.
2. Crazy busy during lunch hour.  You better hope the guy in front of you isn't ordering 15 shawarms for his coworkers.
3. Limiting seating area -- most people take out though
4. Selections are sometimes limited if you show up too late (if they sell out)"}
{"text":"The best fallafels....made there, fried there, eaten there. It is a fast food small place at the east end of the Nasr Plaza. The same owners have a restaurant with the same name 3 doors down which is also awesome.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quick and cheap excellent shawarma. I used to go all the time when I lived and worked nearby, a recent visit was a little bit disappointing that it wasn't quite as good as I remembered - however - do not confuse that with being not good. It's definitely a solid option for a good quick meal. They have a 2-for-1 shawarma deal which is great - and they do good filling platters with tabouleh, hummus, etc."}
{"text":"The shwarma here are the larger ones.  While bigger in size, i think it lacks in toppings.  I don't know if i had to ask for the sauces or pickels, but they didn't go on it by default.  And those are my favorite parts of the shwarma.  I think there was too much onions and cilantro, it overpowered the flavors of the chicken and hot sauce..."}
{"text":"Farhat is my quick and cheap meal if I'm heading out of Toronto. Two for one falafels are always my choice and I just ask for \"the works\" (although prepare for you and your car to reek of garlic the next day). Always friendly staff, but the whole process takes longer than making a sub, so be prepared to wait a while if you aren't first in line.

Once I ordered four falafels and I think the worker mis-understood me and only made two. When I clarified, they didn't even break a sweat (despite the lineup) and seamlessly worked it in to their workflow with the other customers. You don't get that kind of service without a sneer at other 'fast food chains'. Top marks to the employees."}
