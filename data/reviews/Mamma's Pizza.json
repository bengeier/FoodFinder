{"text":"Mamma's Pizza!!
Many pizza places have disappointed me lately, but not Mamma's Pizza. Its just a small pizza place, barely any room to sit in, but I love the pizzas. The crust is thin and crispy which I love.
Staff is friendly, food is great, I'll definitely be back more than once!"}
{"text":"It's probably silly to review a place for a single item, but seriously: try the Veneziana pizza. It will change your pizza life. Artichoke pesto, roasted garlic, kalamata olives, prosciutto. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Horrible Pizza - very oily, literally drips. Wings smelled terrible, it was obviously reheated. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Got a slice their today, had pepperoni and some dipping sauce roasted garlic I think. The pizza was warm not hot, cheese wasn't really oozing off like it should be, was very thin crust which was nice.

Overall pizza was 2/5 

Dipping sauce was the bomb dot Com 4/5 (best I ever had is toppers pizza which I only had in sudbury ont) this comes second. 

Dipping sauce 4/5 

Customer service was typical about 5 people were working it made no sense but I like to see a restaurant over staffed then under staffed! Well that's my experience in the business haha! Otherwise it was pretty average customer service 

Customer service 3/5"}
{"text":"Ordered from Mamma's pizza late night when staying downtown.  The delivery was quick and the pizza was really good - your typical mamma's pizza quality with thin new york style pizza.

I think mamma's uses some real good quality ingredients"}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas Thursday on the website and received confirmation delivery number for 6:15 pm delivery. At 6:30pm my wife called to find out the status and was told that they never received the order. The owner, Mohammed, told me that the mix up wasn't his problem and that it was a head office problem. Extremely poor customer service and the fact he would not take responsibility and passed it off to \"a head office problem\" we will never order again from Mammas. If you can't get online ordering right in 2016 and don't empower you franchise owners to correct an issue on the spot you don't deserve my business."}
{"text":"Usually go to Mamma's downtown on the Ryerson campus
Tried this one today
Ordered a family size 
It was ready when I got there
It was fresh but Idk by the time I got home it was cold, maybe because it was on the cold leather seat and I got stuck in traffic for a while
The owner is Indian but that doesn't bother me
I will try a different set of toppings next time
Thin crust is awesome
I don't really know popular choices or really tasty ones
If u have recommendations please help me out!!! 
Paid 28$ for a family size its already done
Thanks"}
{"text":"I've always been a bit conflicted about Mamma's Pizza, and when I was there last week, my feelings were confirmed. Now, I like the pizza itself: it's a nice, thin crust (though a bit soft for its size, and therefore floppy), and the toppings are tasty. It's not sludgy or greasy, as other pizzas tend to be.

But it's not a particularly good value, since Mamma's average prices are higher than the chain competition a few blocks away--and that's not even taking into account the fact that, thanks to the very thin crust, you don't get as much sheer mass in their pizza. You have to eat more slices to feel full.

So after getting another Mamma's flyer in the mail a while ago, I decided to use a coupon for a walk-in special large pepperoni for $9.99. The guy at the counter said the price had gone up on the special, which irked me a bit (it was a little under a buck, but still--the flyer was new. Wait until you give 'em all away before raising prices, guys). The wait was short, although it seemed longer what with the Flintstones cartoons on the TV, and the noisy kids in the smallish dining area. But the pizza was good.... ambivalence reigns."}
{"text":"This is the first review I have ever taken the time to write on Yelp.  The pizza and wings from Mamma's may be the worst meal I have had in my 36 years.  I actually think the wings were rancid, absolutely awful!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better pizzas I've tried. Have never tried Mamma's before this but I will be buying from them in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered from this Mamma's location. The delivery was quick. Unfortunately, the pizza was cold, the wings were undercooked (no crispy skin), and they forgot the salad we ordered. When we called to have the cost of the salad refunded to our credit card, it took 15 minutes for them to say that they could actually do it, all the while trying to convince us to take a credit instead. Needless to say it wasn't a superb experience. It was our first time and probably our last. That said the flavours were good once the wings were cooked and the pizza heated."}
{"text":"Today November the 18 2016 I went for a pizza and I order a blue cheese dipping sauce and was expired November the 14 and they argue with me the I was wrong they say the was production day and the dipping sauce has b/b 2016 Nov 14 very poor service and very poor quality control if you order from here you don't know what your eating that's what I see what's behind the counter maybe more expired products good luck eating"}
{"text":"Yes it's a pizza joint but there's still a few expectations. The service was blah no interest was shown in the customer. Onto the pizza - we order a cheese pizza there's not too many ways you can go wrong with this but they still manage to just that. The cheese was not oozing and the crust was soogy no crunch to it.  Won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Pizza is good
Proprietor great, wonderful
I witnessed a random act of anonymous kindness on his part
Thank you"}
{"text":"My favourite relatively inexpensive pizza place.  Always hot / fresh and quick.  Lots of parking as well but only a few seats if you wanted to sit down."}
{"text":"The pizzeria is small and the pizza you buy per slice looks like it's been sitting out for the entire day and not appealing. The selection is limited unless you're buying a freshly made one and even then the doughy is soggy and over price. I would recommend going to pizza pizza or pizzahut instead"}
{"text":"just ordered from mammas after a couple of years, and what a huge mistake!  This place used to be good.  It sucks now!  Chicken Parmesan didnt even taste like chicken, sauce tasted old and burnt, side pasta was soooo overcooked with the old burnt tomato sauce as was used on the chicken,  overall a horrible dining experience that ended up in the garbage.   To add insult to injury, the delivery creep was leering at me up and down."}
{"text":"Just horrible service.  The only reason I come back is because this is the only Mamma's Pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place and great owner who is very friendly! The pizza is very unique and the environment is comforting. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Always walk past this pizza place and not a cold rainy saturday stay-in-movie-night we decided to get take out from here. 

Had the pesto pizza with feta, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes - the first slice was great the second slice however got a little much on the pesto. The dough was nice and thin.

Not much space to sit in here - its more of a quick slice or take away place. They do not have wings but have lots of other salads and pastas to choose from."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from this location. The manager is a liar. I phoned and ordered 2 pizzas, one to pay by Visa and one to pay by cash. They delivered only1 pizza and claimed that I only ordered one Pizza. The manager literally called me a liar. Never again."}
{"text":"The customer service is just as bad as the pizza.   I spoke with the franchise owner who worked there when I walked into the store.   He was very arrogant and tried to belittle me.  
Meanwhile,  the pizza wasn't anything to write home about.   It was cold,  flavorless and rather forgettable.   The only reason I remember it at all is for the poor service.   
\"But it's just a pizza joint, \" you exclaim.   
No.  It is a customer service establishment which sells pizza.  Unfortunately,  the owner and this store failed to deliver on both.   
Thanks but no thanks.   
My Mamma is a much better cook.   
And she gives extraordinary customer service,  to boot."}
{"text":"I just ordered from this place for the first time. Since they offer vegan pizza and I'm lactose intolerant I had high hopes of finally finding something pizza-ish I could eat. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed the second I opened the pizza box. The texture and look of vegan cheese is nothing like lactose-free or regular cheese. The taste is way off too - it sticks to the roof of your mouth and is unpalatable. I also ordered a regular pepperoni pizza for the kids. The crust was thin, soggy and burnt, the pepperoni was thick and a strange pink colour. They each had one slice and said the same thing I did: Meh! On the up side, delivery was prompt and ordering was easy."}
{"text":"I don't where to start really. Came into town for a conference and ordered a pizza at a nearby Mammas, only a couple blocks away. Ordered a simple 2 topping pizza for delivery to my hotel (Hyatt) Pizza arrived 1 hour 25 minutes later, cold and undercooked. The meat on top didn't even look like it was safe to eat to be honest. Clearly no care was taken in the making of my order. Unbelievably disappointing. Will never order again from any Mammas location."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Manager needs a crash course on how to treat people!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out and so I placed an order online. I was called to say they have no gluten-free dough for our pizza bases and would I like to change my order. Not off to a good start."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the pizza I get the spaghetti in meat sauce with garlic bread. It's delicious! They put a good amount of sauce which I especially like for dipping the bread in. It's a fresh tomato and meat flavored sauce. Great portion and value. They also includes parmesan cheese on the side. I recommend getting an additional order of garlic bread. Great service! Open late! Better than riccis!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place about 10 times. I only had 1 bad experience where the pizza was burnt. They were apologetic, and fixed the matter as soon as possible. Overall this is a great place. They do gluten free pizza as well, and their crust is nice and thin. You get more of the toppings than bread, which is really what you want when you eat pizza."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizzas for the price . They goofed up the order . Initially mentioned there was no meat and When I got home and called that I see pork they said they messed up . No apologies what so ever. I asked if they could deliver it and was told they are past the time. Went back again to get a New pizza minus the meat. Again no apologies . Quality of the pizza not so great for the price . Go do yourself a favor and order from martinos for 60% of the price . Never again ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
This place was just bought by a new owner six months ago. I went in the for first time today and almost immediately the owner came out and started talking to me. Apparently the previous owner was a bit of a disaster and getting customers back has been a bit of challenge. The new owner (I can't believe I didn't get his name) is a great guy and seems to really pride himself on providing a superior product to some of the other pizza options in the area. They certainly aren't the cheapest here, but some of the deals are not bad and the pizza is excellent. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
I like to try a basic pizza out first when sampling a new place so I went with a pepperoni mushroom. It was excellent. Thin crust, toppings right to the edge and homemade-tasting sauce (I got a huge chunk of plum tomato on one slice). Also, the veal sandwich is very good for a quick, cheap snack. Thick but super tender meat on a well toasted bun. 

That being said, it seems Mamma's specialty is more in the gourmet pizzas and pastas. Don't worry, I'm sure I'll go back so I can update this.

SERVICE NOTES
Reasonably quick service. The owner makes most of the food here (he claims to put in over 80 hours a week) and takes good care. Delivery available. 

LOCATION NOTES
Slightly hidden in the Tim's/Wendy's plaza on the east side of Trafalgar, south of Dundas. Patio coming soon apparently. Bar stools for eating in. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
They say never trust a skinny chef. No worries here."}
{"text":"Good choice for pizza when you're not feeling like a chain restaurant. The taste was more \"authentic\". The crust is on the thinner side and the sauce is fairly sweet, but the topping choices are excellent and they are generous with the toppings! We got a large pizza with pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, green peppers and pineapple, and a calzone with chicken, green peppers, onions and pineapple. Both were good and the calzone was HUGE! Easily two meals. It was more expensive than a chain like Pizza Pizza or Dominos but it was a good alternative. I wouldn't get it all the time but I would order again! Delivery was on time too, and there were plenty of payment options."}
{"text":"I called from Mamma's Pizza today for delivery order.  The ordering process was easy and they were super helpful with recommendations.  Unfortunately, my delivery guy was in an accident en route. When I called Mamma's pizza at the 90 minutes after my order was placed, the owner was super apologetic and said that my order would be 50% off.  After I got off the phone, my order arrived 10 minutes later and the new delivery guy was also apologetic.  

I was very impressed by the level of customer service.  The pizza was still warm when it arrived and was very tasty!

I will definitely order again from this location."}
{"text":"Pizza is greasy. Pizza slices are stale. Sometimes they serve you yesterday's left-overs. I like the thin crust though.

When I went there today the worker collected my money and then without washing his hands he put his hand in the mozzerella cheese and sprinkled it on my manicotti.   My manicotti was still cold inside when served to me, so I had to give it back to him to put back in the oven again.  The manicotti was low quality.

The garlic bread was stale and cold too.  So I gave it back to him.  He put it back in the oven after I had taken a bite out of it.  They grossed me out.  I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Slices may look good but we ordered two large pies and after waiting 15 min , we received two personal size pies !!! We asked about the pies that they have on display and they said that's just what they make for takeout slices  false advertisement we thought we were getting two of the largest pies we barely fit our families taste was adequate nothing great at all"}
{"text":"Mamma's Pizza is one of those places I've always had a bit of a soft spot for. They're just a little bit different than most other pizza places, and so it's a nice change when I can get out to one. 
As usual, I grabbed a slice and ate it in house. There's limited seating here, but I've also never had to wait for a seat or eat my slice somewhere else, so it seems there's enough for their purposes. 
The slice itself was very good. I do like the way they put cheese all the way up to the edge of the crust so it melts over the edges and crisps up in the oven. I'm usually one who'll go back and eat the crust after I'm finished the slice(s) if I'm still hungry. Not here though. I look forward to the crust, eat it as I go, and never throw any of it out. 
I do also like that they have a bit of a thinner crust, but make up for the lack of thickness by having large slices. They kind of hang over the edge of the tray they serve them in. 
To me, it seems like the staff take pride in their product and pride in their serving of it, and so I'll be back to this location again and again."}
{"text":"I often stop by for a slice. When they are fresh I quite enjoy them. Nice thin crust and the cheese is very flavourful. 

On the other hand, if the pizza is not fresh, I swear the cheese is made from plastic."}
{"text":"I went here to support their  'Send Kids to Camp' $5 pizza event yesterday. Maximum 2 small/medium pizzas for $5 Each! Can you imagine my excitement when they came in these cute boxes? 

They were so delicious - super thin crust, oozing cheese and well ..leftovers for lunch today!  

Two pizzas with dipping sauce for $13? Sign me up."}
{"text":"The food at Mamma's is good. Good enough to return, but, unfortunately each time I return, I get a little more disappointed. The first time was when there forgot my order, and tonight when the food wasn't cooked enough. The wings were a bit undercooked (as in cooked enough, but not crispy as wings should be) and she mixed up the sauces for the two different orders. Then the pizza-the pepperoni was a bit too pink..and then the Mediterranean Salad-not enough cheese, though plenty of green peppers for sure. 
I love buying locally and I try and avoid the bigger franchises, but maybe I should go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time a couple of weeks ago.
I went for the large pepperoni special (10 bucks before tax)
I thought that was a bargain. It was a very tasty pizza for the money."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for a quick and cheap lunch. The slice I got was huge! The pizza was thin and a nice change from the regular pizza I would get from Pizza Pizza. Bonus: This location has a pool table and an open atmosphere with lots of fresh air. Not to shabby Mamma."}
{"text":"Order was 15 mins late then half my order was missing! Waited another 35 mins for the rest of my order to arrive. Manager refused to do anything about it and blamed the just eat app that we ordered through. Do yourself a favour and order anywhere else. When I finally did get to eat, I was disgusted to find that the crust was barely cooked. Horrible service and barely tolerable food.what a waste."}
{"text":"STANDING ROOM ONLY

Looking for a quick bite on a breezy Family Day we stumbled in to Mamma's Pizza as we waited for the ferry to the Toronto Islands.

Service was friendly enough, price was affordable compared to a lot of what you'd find in downtown Toronto and the pizza was very, surprisingly, good. Two slices of pepperoni and green pepper pizza with a soda was around $12.

I also really liked that the slice was itself sliced into two smaller pieces for easier eating. I would have liked to sit down, but we were lucky enough to find an area at the standing bar where several families were also eating their slices. A baseball game was blaring out of the TV just above where I was standing.

In sum, if you are looking for a cheap meal near this part of the waterfront you would not be wrong to try Mammas."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Sunday. 

Pros:
- Seating available 
- Quick service 

Cons:
- Average pizza
- Pricey"}
{"text":"Foods good. It's expensive but this is not exclusive to this location. Head office determines pricing. 

Wish they opened til later. Especially on weekends when pizza cravings come into effect late at night."}
{"text":"Not recommended.

We called to order pizza and asked for a couple things on half the pizza (which it allows us to order online).  The guy started yelling at my boyfriend while ordering.  I could hear the yelling and I wasn't the one on the phone.  Anyway, my boyfriend had to hang up on the Mamma's Pizza worker.
Because I really wanted to try the vegan pizza, we figured we'd just order online.  It went through but then they called because the online ordering wasn't working.  So I went to tell the guy my order but I couldn't get past the vegan cheese.  All I wanted was vegan cheese instead of regular cheese, it's advertised right outside the store.  The guy had no clue what I was talking about.  He kept listing other types of cheese (feta, cheddar, etc.) and didn't seem to understand the concept of vegan cheese.  Eventually I just hung up because I really don't think I should be spending over five minutes advertising something on their menu."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this place. Waited over 2 hours for delivery.  Pizza wasn't anything spectacular. Hardly any cheese tasted like tomato sauce pizza. I would rather rate a 0 star. Over priced, I'm surprised why people would spend over $40 on delivery. 
Never ordering from mamas again."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to grab a slice- and although a slice is yummy, I would never recommend anyone to order delivery from here. It is pretty much guaranteed to take about an hour- and to arrive luke warm and soggy.
New owners- not nearly as good as the old-  are seriously lacking phone skills."}
{"text":"After trying out various delivery chain pizza joints in the downtown core. We have settled on this place. Pizza of choice is meat ball and the prices are in line with other chains. The delivery promise has been met which is always great. When there is a ball game on and you know its freezing outside this is a good way to kill the winter blues. I like their website for ordering pizza as well."}
{"text":"Ordered Mamma's for first time in years, and it was a huge disappointment. I ordered the special which included 2 cans of pop and dipping sauce. They got the pop wrong entirely and didn't give me the dipping sauce. I ordered from them because I wanted a combo with the pop and sauce. Never again! Oh and the pizza was pretty lacking too."}
{"text":"Mama's Pizza gets 3.5 stars from me, and is one of the better options of the Big Chain franchise pizza joints in Toronto. 
I always struggle with Mama's Pizza because it is consistent, which is a strong selling point for a pizza joint, however that consistency also applies to what I like least about them too. Sadly, they manage to consistently do those things, as well.

Bests:
- Sauce and cheese that go right to the edge - no big stingy 2 inch border requiring dipping sauce here!
- Thin crust, but more in the New York or neighbourhood style, not that crunchy cracker thin California style pizza.
- A large number of interesting specialty pizzas that are not skimpy on the toppings. Their Meatball pizza is one fave.
- Vegan options, including Daiya vegan cheese, and an absolutely delicious vegan Italian sausage, which is lightly seasoned, moist and delicious.

Worsts:
- Slightly pricy, with weaker deals & coupons than some chains.
- Poor oven management, and/or an unusual style of pizza that never, ever browns on top, even when you order \"extra well done\" to the point where the crust is charred in places (which I Like by the way).

In my restauranteur past, an well-done crust with lightly-cooked toppings and cheese, was a sure sign of inexperienced cooks over-handling the pizzas while peering into the oven, keeping the oven door open too much, not allowing it to heat up properly and forcing the stone deck to do all the work.
However Mama's Pizza does this so consistently that it has to be by design, which I think is a bit of an unfortunate choice.

That quibble aside, their pizzas are tasty, the sauce is delicious, the toppings are generous and fresh, and overall it's quite a good pizza when compared to the ubiquitous 'orange guys'.
Next time you are tempted to sacrifice your taste buds to the gods of rhyming phone numbers comma try \"310-Mamma\" instead, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas via their website almost 2 hours ago. We were patient and waited just over an hour before calling to see what the issue was. I even asked my boyfriend to check the confirmation and he showed me the email.

When I called the store, the man who answered simply said that he did not have my order. I confirmed the number of the store and the address and told him that I had a confirmation email. He said it was not his fault, but he would send out the pizzas.

Starving, after waiting for 2 hours already, I asked him how long it would take. He said right away. I asked how long he estimated that I would have to wait, but he could not confirm.

I asked if there would be a discount, seeing as how I was patient and still willing to pay for the pizzas. He told me \"No\". He said he could not determine if it was my fault or his fault, maybe just the internet. I reminded him that I was a paying customer who had a confirmation for my order and that I'm thus case it would be good business to give a discount given the issue at hand. He said no, and began to argue with me saying it wasn't his fault but I could still have the pizzas. 

Forgive me, but at this point I don't want to wait another 2 hours for a pizza that the guy likely added some bodily fluid to, to punish me for calling him and arguing. And acting as though I would still be lucky to be able to order from there??

Forget it.

There are tons of delivery services in this city right now. Pizza is not rocket science and neither is good customer service. This pizza joint ought to close its doors. But I have the feeling this will happen soon anyway with the way they treat their customers. Mistakes happen--I get it. But it's how a business goes about fixing things for the consumer that makes things better and ensures repeat business. Don't bother with this place. They have no respect for their customers and with all the choices out there, you don't need pay someone for disrespect."}
{"text":"Sooo I've never been here before because it never drew my attention-thought was just another pizza place...BUT then I discovered they had v e g a n pizza! lol 
Long story short the nice man ( maybe the owner/manager) added some vegan cheese onto my already made veggie pizza and it was like SO GOOD. Even my bf thought it tasted like regular cheese. The crust is thin (which i really liked), and there was like no oil on my hands afterwards.. overly greasy pizza is gross. GO AND TRY A VEGAN PIZZA FROM HERE HAHA"}
{"text":"Ordered last night for delivery. We got a large margarita pizza, a veal sandwich with cheese, mushrooms and onions and a large caesar salad.  

Ordering process: we ordered online. It was easy and straight forward. I received a confirmation email with a recap of my order. Downfall, delivery time was estimated at 50 minutes on a Wednesday evening at 9pm. That's a long time!

Delivery: it did take 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive. The delivery guy was friendly. 

Pizza: it was pretty good. I really like their sauce with the real chunks of roma tomatoes and the little bit of sweetness. There could have been a little more cheese. I found myself taking quite a few bites with just sauce and no cheese. There was a lot of roasted garlic on it. I mean A LOT. Next time I would order it without. I like the New York style thin crust. The edges of the pizza weren't crispy, but I actually really liked it, I don't love crispy crust. I would definitely order their pizza again. It was very expensive ($23), but I love how different it is compared to the large pizza chains and the variety they offer. 

Sandwich: amazing! It was huge and there was tons of sauce and cheese on it. It was a good sized piece of veal that was breaded. Not greasy at all. They definitely nailed a good veal sandwich that could easily rival California Sandwiches. Extremely decently priced. $6 for the sandwich plus the extra cheese, onions and mushrooms, so approx. $9.

Caesar Salad: nothing special to be honest. Just romaine lettuce, croutons, fake parmesan cheese and dressing. I wasn't a huge fan of the dressing they use - not creamy enough. It was pretty basic, I wouldn't order again.

Overall, I would definitely order from Mamm's again. They have an extensive menu with lots of unique pizza combinations, lots of pasta options and quite a few sandwiches. There is something for everyone. Expect to spend more than usual on your pizza, but it's worth it. Pasta and sandwiches are decently priced."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times but only because it was cheap and still not too bad. Had eaten their cheese pizza a couple of times. The tomato sauce tastes like it comes out of a can which it most likely does. It's nothing special but it fills you up without leaving a hole in your wallet. 
Not too bad."}
{"text":"After ordering a pizza, my boyfriend went to pick it up using a $50.00 gift card that my mother purchased over the phone for us in late July. The manager said it had been redeemed because it had pen scratches on it. We have never used this voucher. The manager was yelling at him saying it was not valid. My boyfriend left upset and very frustrated. When he told me what happened, I called the location where the manager proceeded to yell at me over the phone saying it was a redeemed voucher. I asked him to let me speak so I could ask him to check his records for the time that it was purchased. He wouldn't even listen to reason so that I could explain how it was purchased and was legitimate. I have been ordering from Mamma's for over 20 years and they just lost a loyal customer due to the managers terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Very limited review since it's only for one pizza slice. I was driving by and couldn't wait for a snack at home. I didn't want McD's so it was about the only option left in the plaza.

The pizza didn't look like it was in the greatest shape (it was 10:30pm though), and I asked how much it was. The guy told me they were closing soon and he'd sell it at half price. After it was reheated it came out looking much better. It tasted quite good considering and didn't seem too dried out. It's probably a sign of quality ingredients as you can't really pull a Lazarus with a pizza slice like this at most other pizza places."}
{"text":"When you walk past this place on Yonge it kind of looks like any other gross small sweaty slice pizza joint.
But when you step inside it is a VERY nice surprise- large space that wraps around the back for people to sit.
Nice banquette seating and bar seating on the side, and a really pleasant air of conversation inside.  It took me by surprise, that's for sure.

My pesto and mushroom pizza cost $4 and change and it came out to a large slice cut in half (not as big as pizzaiolo).
but the pizza was good, and there was nothing to complain about.
Although I'm rather forgiving of pizza in toronto after I found out that most Ontarions actually enjoy the chain Pizza Pizza (aka diarrhea on crust).

Oh, and this place even serves beer and wine!  It really is quite a cute place that I would potentially visit again.
not the best value for your money, especially in this area where there are  a LOT of quick bites, but it is worth going to if you are in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"We always order from this branch whenever we crave for pizza. We usually order a large pizza and ask them to split it in half. My half is usually the basic pizza with extra asiago. My husband's half would usually have meat on it. You can also ask them to make the crust a little more toasted.

I love their manicotti! It is so good! 

We've tried ordering from other pizza places but for some reason, we keep going back to Mamma's!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick slice.  Great pizza.  They have a perfectly crisp bottom crust.  Great place to grab a slice."}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong piece of pizza and the pop was warm I left it on the table and got up to leave because I'd tried to get the attention of the staff behind the counter but I couldn't. Someone sitting at a table told me \"the garbage is over there so use it\". I replied \"the garbage is right here and never looked back, leaving the wrong piece of pizza and the warm pop sitting on the table."}
{"text":"Great price! And you get 1 free slice after buying 10. It is a go-to place for a cheap meal.... How long is long enough to become a review? I normal eat their Canadian, which is 4 dollar. Come on... It's long enough finally"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place despite the negative reviews. I'm glad that I did so.

This place has a great selection of vegan options. You can choose from 6 gourmet pizzas or build your own with daiya cheese and veggies / mock meats. The menu clearly indicates vegan toppings. Quick and friendly service. Plenty of walk in deals.

Overall this is a cozy pizza place with vegan options near my area. Perfect for takeout."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for takeout and the individual (who may in fact have been the owner) went right from handling cash to making my pizza with his bare hands. 

Who knows how long before that he washed his hands, as hygiene is out the window at this place.  

On other occasions I have seen the employees (and franchisee) eating pizza between preparing and service food - and again - with no hand washing in between.  

I should add I have see the way the owner talks to his employees - including students likely around the age of 16.  I don't know who else to summarize but sounds like verbal abuse to me versus management.

I am just grossed on so many levels and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was kinda disappointed as I thought this place would be the best quality pizza to have, even before entering the store there is a nice aroma of the smell of pizza that smells so nice right at the front of their doorway! but it all went downhill from there as the pizza was nice thin and large sized but really it was like as thin as you could think of a piece of paper! and the taste wasn't so good as if the pizza was not properly cooked or something, I had better pizza elsewhere and will try elsewhere next time when exploring the harbour-front, also the prices are way too high and expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered an XL Pizza, 3 lbs chicken wings, and 4 pops, and it the worst food delivery experience ever!! Pizza showed up and this is what we got - WTH?! Called the store back, they were nice enough to make a new pizza and deliver to us (which is the only reason you're getting 1 star), but they skimped on the toppings on our second pizza. Our wings were disgusting - they were luke warm and greasy = gross!  Will NEVER order food from Mama's again!"}
{"text":"Oh Mamma! MAMMA MAMMAMMAMAMMA... 

I used to associate Mamma's Pizza with the Pizza Pizza, Pizza Nova, 241 franchised pizza joints.  That was until I tried mamma's.  Their pizza is pretty light, the crust is thin and crispy, and there's not an overload of toppings or cheese.  

They have some pretty unique types of pizza there such as Pizza Alla Bruschetta, or potato pizza. I've tried Mamma's Mediterranean and Mamma's Giardino Classic  - both vegetarian options (mamma's has much better preset veggie selections than most pizza places).  I've also tried the spicy sicilian - let me tell you, I can handle my share of heat, but this is HAWTTTT! It ain't the mild \"spicy\" you're used to at regular restaurants.  

This Mamma's is fairly standard, like all Mamma's Pizza location. Small store front, little to no seating and yummy tasting pizza. What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago this chain had fairly good slices, the one on Queen's Quay is OK, but the other locations are really bad. You can walk past and two hours later the same slices are still sitting there. Rubbery, tasteless with zero sauce and some tasteless cheese and a flabby \"crust\".

So went in and there was only two dried up slices, so I asked if they were putting any new ones in; the answer was 7-10 minutes, so I waited. At 15 minutes I asked what's with the slices and the idiots hadn't even put them in the oven yet and they didn't bother to tell me and left me sitting there with my head up my backside all that time for nothing. And it's 35c outside, I could have gone to a real restaurant and been halfway through a meal by now.

Never again will I spend any money in this chain. It's like dealing with children who can't even deal with customers in an adult fashion."}
{"text":"This is the worst food I've ever eaten. Ordered two calzone 's, both were doughy and raw, not enough ingredients, definitely not giving the customer what they paid for. Ordered the calzones at 6:09pm and received them at 7:28pm, I'm 9 minutes away by car? If I ordered them from Rome I would have received them sooner I'm sure. I called and told them never again and I also advised the delivery guy, never again. Avoid this place, there are better places to order from and you will receive your food in time for Christmas."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but I won't Oder again 
Extremely slow delivery :( 
Not reliable at all"}
{"text":"I love the slices here but not sure if its standard practice but when we purchased a full pizza wasn't too pleased. To start we wanted a pulled pork pizza but they were out of pulled pork. We got the combination pizza instead. Its decent pizza. better than your  typical chain pizza shops. It was thin crust and had a good amount of toppings which filled us up. I guess i was expecting more. Also the store was freezing and our pizza got cold before we could finish."}
{"text":"Thin-crust, plentiful, fresh toppings, timely delivery relatively good customer service.

Mamma's party pizzas are an easy way to feed a large group & the Mamma's salad (with olives, egg, and mozzarella cheese) is always a favourite!! 

Recommended pizza: Veggie & Mamma's Mediterranean"}
{"text":"Not a bad place or bad pizza. The pizza slices are gigantic but the dough is really thin. They have a selection of pre-cooked pizza's that you order by the slice. They then heat it up and serve it to you. There is a lot of oil on the pizza when it comes out of the oven. You can probably fill a quarter of a coke can with the oil if you really chose to. What I like about it is that you can put whatever garnishes you want on it. They've got some grated parmesan, some basil leaves, red pepper flakes, etc. 

However, this is by no means NYC style pizza so that's why it only gets a 3 star."}
{"text":"Their pizza used to be super greasy but went there a couple days ago and it was actually not oily at all. They have a bunch of pizza's already cooked that you can order by the slice and these slices are enormous. One of these will be enough for a meal. They also serve other italian food (pasta's, veal sandwiches, etc.) but I've actually never tried them before because I only go there for the pizza."}
{"text":"We have been ordering delivery for about a year now. They are amazing! Food is always great and if they ever make a mistake they are quick to make it up!! Delbert is prompt and they always throw something on like a dessert or something! I love their veal parm sandwiches!! Thanks for being a great place to order food in the beaches!!"}
{"text":"$70 for two large pizzas. Oily, salty and lacking the taste you expect given the price. Wont repeat."}
{"text":"Another entry in Toronto's corporate pizza sphere. This particular location is across the street from the Pizzaville fail location. 

Mamma's position itself as a kind of gourmet slice/delivery operation, which means some pies have feta cheese and artichoke. Aside from the feta cheese pies, it serves up a decent selection of slices (unlike Pizzaville). The joint is clean and bug free (unlike Pizzaville). Prices are a nudge higher but instead of wasting your time walking into Pizzaville to find they have no slices or what they have are crawling with fruit flies, just head here is you're in the Yonge/Sheppard area and looking for a quick, hot, delicious slice."}
{"text":"No Mamma works here ...my order was wrong, and lousy to boot, and I dealt with an angry manager who blamed the food delivery service for their error.  I've followed up on this and it's clear that they have no interest in making things right.  Not the food delivery service's error ... just a nice default error for some terrible service."}
{"text":"Whatever your motivations for getting a quick slice of pizza [eating a quick lunch on the run / a slice before the big night out / drunk] (delete as appropriate), this location of the Mamma's franchise is in a prime location as a springboard into the night, or the capsule that saves you at the end of it.

Standard of the franchise is the Mamma's icon of the doting Italian mother, who is of course nowhere to be seen behind the counter.  But no matter.  The quality of the pie is well over satisfactory.  Of the franchise pizza options out there, Mamma's delivers quite a nice slice for your buck.  Centrally located just on the periphery of Club Land, this place gets packed just after 2:00am...for some reason.  The slice variety is consistently varied enough to satisfy most anyone's hankerings, the dining area is clean, and they are licensed, so if desired, you can enjoy a nice beer with your slice.  If Labatt's Blue can be considered \"nice\".  Definitely worth a stop-in or stumble-in depending upon how your night is going.  Take a run at the Devil's Delight.  I dare you."}
{"text":"Definitely a better take-out pizza than a lot of other chains like Pizza Hut or Pizza Pizza. It's nice New York thin crust pizza. The crust is crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. The pepperoni and mushrooms were also quite good quality. The tomato sauce could have been a little sweeter, and I would have liked a little more cheese. Next time I'll order extra cheese. My husband was not as keen on the pizza, but said the wings \"were perfect.\" We ordered medium with ranch. The chicken fell right off the bone, and was spicy but not too spicy. 

In addition, the owner was very sociable and friendly to us. He seemed excited that it was our first time there. It's not a great eat-in place. It only has a few bar stools, so you'll probably want to call ahead and just take it back home."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I've ever had. Ordered delivery from justeat. I live six blocks from this pizzeria.  It took an hour to get it delivered. The pizza was burned and tasted like crap. I ordered anchovies and they added ANCHOVIES PASTE not actual anchovies!!!! The dough was burned and taste like mud. Never again I will be ordering from this pizzeria!!!!"}
{"text":"This place truly mastered the art of making a pizza taste like stale pepperoni & tomato sauce on a chewy drywall piece."}
{"text":"I am not sure whether Mamma came from Iceland or Madagascar, but she sure as heck did not come from Italy.  Dry and bland.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Spent $75 on 2 large pizzas and 20 wings (one pizza being a pepperoni) and picked up ourselves. Pizzas barely had any toppings on it and our Hot Sicilian pizza had NO sopressata on it at all!!  Definitely wouldn't order from this location ever again!"}
{"text":"This place is not sanitary. One of the guys behind the counter making the pizza was coughing.  So he covered his  mouth with his hand and then went back to kneading  the dough.  Perhaps other cooties are included for free."}
{"text":"This was the very first Mammas Pizza I tried after moving to Toronto from Vancouver. The clerk/pizza maker was really friendly and service was quick. To be honest, the pizzas didn't look too appealing sitting behind the glass counter, cold and greasy (Pizzaiolo pizza look the same way by the way). However, I made my choice, Gourmet Delight, and waited a few minutes while it was heated up.
Yummmmy! I loved it. The pizza was thin without being crispy like a cracker, had lots of flavors and wasn't overloaded with toppings. I saw a jar of spicy olive oil (it had a red pepper inside it) and decided to try a few drops on the pizza. Wow! It kicked it up a few more notches and was delicious without being too hot. I personally don't like sweating while I eat and am not keen on overly hot foods.
I have since been back to this Mammas and other locations in Toronto and like the pizza a lot. As far as chains go, it's my favorite. 
I have tried Potato Pizza, Mediterranean, European and more. Yes, I have only tried the vegetarian pizzas and not because I am a vegetarian, but because I simply have always preferred veggie pizzas to ones with meat. My partner though, likes the meat ones here and has pepperoni, chicken pizzas and hawaiin and like them as well.
The service can certainly vary from Mamma's Pizza to Mamma's Pizza but overall, the pizza is really good.
For special occasions, they have cheese overlay designs that they can put on your pizza. Children would especially like this and they have Princess, Thomas the Train, and more."}
{"text":"love the pizza hate the service at this location. Very rude... would be watching the tv instead of helping customers."}
{"text":"Your typical pizza joint. I especially like this location because it's in Sunnybrook Plaza (parking lot!). It's quite clean inside and there are always specials here. I would avoid coming here on weekdays during lunch though as it's packed with high schoolers. Adding WiFi would be a nice touch.

Good for: take-out pizza"}
{"text":"I went to Mama's Pizza prior to the management change,  way back in 2008. Back then, I remember my pizza being way overcooked, expensive and extremely small. It also took over an hour and a half (sans delivery, might I add) to get the pizza out to us.

Under the new owner? Man oh man, what a world of difference!

The new owner is a delightful character. He immediately welcomed both myself and a friend of mine into the store, and offered us a few free slices of pizza to try after ordering. The walk in special was $9.95, which is about the average price for a pizza in the area. The place wasn't really suited for sit in dining, but it's a small location, so that was to be expected.

Our pepperoni pizza was, and I say this without a single shred of a lie, one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life. It beats the hell out of all but the most expensive pizzas in the area (Dominos, Pizza Hut, Giovannis, etc. ) The crust was thin, chewy and seasoned with a bit of garlic and pepper, giving it a real Italian-style taste. Everything on the pizza was fresh, and you could tell...right down to the pepperoni itself. The pizza was made with fresh mozzarella, which was melted right onto the pizza. It was filling, and extremely satisfying. It didn't have that \"synthetic\" taste that you get with many other pizzas.

The only things hurting the rating is the fact that this isn't a sit down restaurant. It should be! The pizza is THAT good!

I've found my new delivery joint in Oakville. It's a shame that the old owner made such a mess of things, but it's clear that they've worked hard to turn things around. I am very impressed and will be returning again for more pizza; I'm dying to try the pasta and wings!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery the other night. This is good old italian restaurant pizza. It's neither the gourmet pizza that's too snooty to deliver, nor is it bargain basement (pizza-pizza). For us it was just right, and we'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"Vegan Olive Press is THE BEST. Love that I can eat pizza with the test of the family when we get it. The team here is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery though justeat.ca the other day and expected my food in 60 minutes.  

I ordered a meat pizza and breaded chicken sandwich. I love onions so I thought why not add $0.95 for extra onions? 

90 minutes passed and no sign of my food, and no phone call either. So I called the restaurant and the lady said the weather is bad, your food is on its way. A courtesy call would have been nice.

 My food arrived 20 minutes later with no smile and no apology.  The pizza was dry and salty. Word of advice, if you must order from this place save you money and skip the extras!  I couldn't believe I paid $0.95 for 3 slivers of red onion! I will never ever order from this place again!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, being from Chicago, this pizza wasn't good, comparative speaking.  The service was excellent but product needs work.  I like the cheese/crust that is browned, I believe it was undercooked.  I want be returning but wish them luck!"}
{"text":"I had better pizza in Asia. With our pickup the bread was soggy and the pepperoni was colourless. Weirdly my boyfriends stomach hurt very bad after attempting a slice making us wonder if the meat was even good. This pizza was anything but fresh and easily the worst pizza I have ever had for such crap prices."}
{"text":"I ordered some meat pizza. It was somewhat dry, like the cheese on the pizza was all a dark shade of orange. There wasn't much meat on the pizza. It tasted okay. I mean like it wasn't disgusting, just very mediocre.

I ordered a steak sandwich, which had barely any meat and was full of just vegetables. The sandwich was soggy and tasted kind of bad. It wasn't very tasty and the sauce kind of had a bad after taste.

I also tried the pasta and wings. The pasta had hardly any meat and again tasted very okay. I would describe it as bad homemade pasta. It didn't taste disgusting but it felt like a rip off for the amount of money I was paying. Again the wings tasted okay. But for something I'm paying this much money for and with all the other options out there for the same price it was overall crappy. The wings looked pretty bad too, like there were burnt parts, and you could see most of the whiteness of the chicken with smears of sauce on it. If I went to a friends house and they or their parents made the wings or pasta for me I wouldn't complain.

If this place was a lot cheaper i'd give it a slightly higher rating but IMO its a place you should avoid until the quality improves or the prices drop dramatically."}
{"text":"I order in pizza once every 5 years, if that.  Hardly ever.  Once in a blue moon I get a craving.

I ordered the standard \"slow roasted tomatoes\" (which tasted as though they were straight out of a tin), with generous portions of Asiago cheese, clumped, not blended.  Garlic was burned (therefore, bitter), and the proportions of herbs (I am assuming oregano) was somewhere in the background - didn't taste it, just found it in my teeth afterwards.  Spouse had a veal sandwich - which was stodgy and nasty. 

$40.00 (included tip) for this waste of time.  Never again!  Now I know why I never order pizza.  They USED TO BE GOOD, now, its like forget about it.  Just kill$ me to have wa$ted money on dreck - and it was, dreck.  Honestly, one of the regular \"chains\" could have probably done better."}
{"text":"Had to wait 50 minutes when I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes for pickup on the phone. Four other's were waiting for their pizza as well and very unhappy by the time they'd received it."}
{"text":"More like 3.5. We ordered delivery to our hotel from here. The calzone was really good! I had a Mediterranean one with sun dried tomatoes, olives (green and black), feta and peppers. The calzone was huge!! The crust was great. Thick and doughy. The sauce had tons of flavor. Lots of toppings and cheese. Great for splitting. 

The order arrived in a timely manner. Only took 30 minutes. Delivery guy was friendly.

We did order the strawberry salad with goat cheese and cranberries. It wasn't great. Strawberries were fresh. I felt like it had potential and maybe we just caught them on an off day. 

I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Mamma's pizza is a small joint that is tucked away at the plaza NE of corner Highway 7 and Valleymede (where McDonald's is!). It is a place that my fiancé often visited when he was a kid. The ratings on Yelp wasn't too promising but we were craving for pizza and fiancé said it is better than Pizzaiolo... so, alrighty then lol.

I would understand why dining in would not be a good idea. It is dinner time, and there were only 4 slices of pizzas left on display. Really nothing much to choose from, so we took the last slice of Greek pizza. I guess this location has more demands for pre-order take outs and delivery. The guy at the back was so busy baking huge trays of pizza.

I thought the pizza was good. I love the thin crispy crust and there were a good amount of olives! Extra points for quick and courteous service. The older lady was really sweet, she walked over and made sure we had napkins while we dined in :) This location has been here for decades... might have changed ownership here and there but they are surviving!"}
{"text":"I called twice, once direct to the store, and the second time navigating through the phone system. Both times the same guy answered, both times refusing my order.

The second time he straight out said 'Didn't you just call? Don't you know how to read online? We're closing.\"

I was looking online, and the location closed at 12:00AM. It was only 11:30PM, yet they refused my order TWO TIMES.

I continued trying to call back, but they wouldn't answer my calls.

I've never been spoken to so rudely before. I will never be ordering from Mamma's again."}
{"text":"We got a medium one-topping pizza (mushroom) for two adults and two kids. There were 2 slices per person. We have small kids, so if you have a party of 4 adults, perhaps think about getting another pizza or two to fill you up. The crust was crispy and thin, surprisingly very good. The pizza took up the entire box, unlike some fast food pizza places where the pizza is barely there when you open the box! 

This was a great place to stop for a quick and inexpensive bite to eat in Toronto. They did have a few white plastic tables and chairs set up in the front of the store outside. So we sat and ate our pizza while watching other tourists stroll down the sidewalk. It was a relaxing lunch. We stopped here on our way to the CN Tower. When we're in town again, I know we'll revisit this place."}
{"text":"Grabbed a large pepperoni pizza ($9.99 walk in special) for a late dinner last night from Mamma's.  Even though this place has been in the neighbourhood for awhile now, we've never eaten here.

Liked the thin crust on the pizza, not too greasy and it was freshly made for us.  It's not the most outstanding pizza I've ever had but it hit the spot.  Will definitely consider it for the next pizza cravings.

The $10 price tag for the entire pie was a pretty good deal considering there was a $5 combo for only one slice of pizza and a drink."}
{"text":"Not sure if my issue is with the delivery service or the pizzeria. We waited the maximum estimated time for delivery and when we opened the box, the pizza was cold and soggy. This is our first experience with Mamma's and we won't be ordering it again. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and the delivery guy was a charm but dangerwillrobinson, this pizza was straight outta Chuck. E. Cheese.  God I miss Chico's."}
{"text":"The pizza is good from a novely standpoint, it's different from your traditional pizzas, with an extremely thin crust. Problem is, you can't eat more than 1 slice of their pizza, cause it feels like you're eating paper with tomato sauce.

2 thumbs down for Mama's Pizza. Rather go to Pizza Pizza, Gino's Pizza, or Pizza Nova in the downtown core."}
{"text":"$10 for 2 slices is not $ and the pizza was old and bitter obviously re-heated multiple times! That's all"}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery a few times. The Pizza is a lot better than Pizza Pizza, Pizza hut etc. Lots of options, taste is great...The kids love it... It is not a restaurant level pizza though.. 3 out 4 times I have ordered they have delivered late..60min (at least) and the last time the pizza was borderline cold and I had to reheat it. So a 4 star \"order in\" Pizza (a 3 compared to higher end restaurants) and a 2 for service."}
{"text":"I ordered three pizza's for pickup.  For one of the pizza's I ordered a Meat Amore.  The difference between the picture on the homepage and what we received is night and day difference.  Albeit I asked for no tomato sauce and added anchovies.  The two pizza's look nothing alike, not even a little bit.  Honestly, I think Mamma would be extremely upset.  The pizza we received is a total abomination.  I have submitted photos so you can be the judge."}
{"text":"I think this is the second or first time having Mama's pizza.. I got a medium pizza with 'goat cheese', tomatoes, chicken and pineapple.. it definitely wasn't goat cheese.. but it still tasted good and I liked the garlic dipping sauce.. it was ready pretty fast and cooked perfectly l. I would for sure order from this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time after a flyer was delivered in the mail, I'm so glad I did! Totally my new favourite pizza place! The pizza was hot and fresh, so delicious! I love the thinner crust, I find most pizza is too much bread! It's a bit pricey but will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Pizza was cool when it was delivered (I live two blocks away) so the cheese was already rubbery. It was a pallid shade of grey, and may have actually been rubber. The crust was the same texture. Disturbing. Only twice in my life have I had a pizza so bad I needed to throw most of it out. This was one of those times.

(FYI the other was at Adriatic Restaurant in Manhattan.)"}
{"text":"Your typical fast food joint. Nice pizza though. Place could be cleaner though. You don't want to visit the restrooms."}
{"text":"Cheap-ish pizza. Stopped in briefly today for an under $4 slice. Pizza was extremely average. Service was average, older guy was somewhat rude. Good place to stop if you're in the area and need something quick"}
{"text":"First time ordering Mamma's Pizza in years! I was glad to see that they have a decent variety of Vegan options. Thus, my co-workers and I decided to order a half vegan, half regular pizza. 

The manager was very accommodating when I requested a pizza to be half vegan and half regular. The overall service was great! 

Onto the pizza itself! Their spicy Sicilian was what you'd expect. Spicy, salty, with a slight tang! Very satisfying. The Vegan pizza got mixed reviews from my group as the daiya cheese that they used was quite creamy. However, I personally enjoyed it. 

I would definitely order from this location again!"}
{"text":"I use to enjoy Mamma's Pizza but lately the quality has taken a nose-dive. Never again. On our most recent experience, we waited an hour and a half for two small pizzas to be delivered which were cold, the toppings were wrong and of the worst quality and our dipping sauces were also wrong. If Mamma's Pizza feels that $40 is an acceptable price for two small, late, cold and incorrect pizzas with two dipping sauces, you genuinely need to reevaluate the product and customer service you put out. I can't say this is one of the worst pizzas I've ever had because that would imply that there's another pizza chain that's worse than Mamma's. After this experience, I don't think there is. Don't bother ordering if you would like to avoid a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Pizza was over an hour late. Called to inquire and they didn't even say hello. Then they told me that since I called it was going to be later now. No apology. Asked for a refund and they said no refunds. They then asked me to hold and never came back on the phone."}
{"text":"Not awful, but awfully expensive. Two 10\" (since when is that the 'medium' size?) with 3 toppings each was over $40 - $45 with a tip. 

And slow. Any pizza that thin should cook in minutes, but it took over an hour for a delivery 4 blocks away, no where near dinner hour - around 10PM.  But 45 minutes was what we were told when ordering, so I'm not blaming the driver.

Did I say thin? I doubt both pizzas together weighed a half pound."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. The place is run usually by a bunch of young guys who don't really seem to care about your ordering. They do their thing and when you are ready process the payment. I called and had about a 20 minute wait which left a experience for me when I showed up to pick our pizza. They should overhaul the staff and get more dedicated employees. 

Pizza over all was great. We continue to go back for that and that alone. Give it a shot! If you spend a few moments in the restaurant and luck out to get a seasoned pizza maker you are golden!"}
{"text":"I still crush on this location, but I have to dock them for their delivery practices. You have to have $15 worth of things for free delivery, but when you're adding to a small order it seems to get pricy quick. 

Should I have gotten lots of soda pops instead of wings? Probably. But pop is bad for you. 

A small cheese pizza just for me!... with a side of cluck."}
{"text":"Garbage. Pizza arrived cold, tasted like cardboard. It's the number one rule of pizza delivery...the pizza needs to be hot/warm."}
{"text":"I should have checked out the reviews before ordering pizza from these guys.  It takes almost 50 minutes for the pizza to arrive from the time the order is placed, which I would not have had a problem with if the pizzas were warm. Once the pizza arrived they were cold and soggy. I called the location again to simply ask the breakdown of the total bill the guy who took the call, possibly the owner, gave me a lots of attitude and informed me that he invested $150,0000 into his system. 

This is when I stopped being nice and raised my voice telling him I did not care about his investments and that all bills must be itemized.  I told him having a single line item showing the total charge on the receipt is not helpful.  For a guy who is pretty gruff on the phone and quick to talk over his customers he went on to tell me to calm down and that's when I lost it it. 

The only 'nice' thing about this situation was the delivery guy since he was polite.  The person handling phone orders can learn his delivery guy."}
{"text":"I had come from the US with US dollars and I paid for my order. They didn't tell me up front that they would not give me the conversion amount of  American money in Canadian money and then they proceeded to charge me the same amount of American dollars as Canadian dollars which I believe to be unethical since he charged me about a quarter of the amount more than the price on the menu in Canadian dollars. The only person who apologized was a kind worker there. The cashier was kind of rude to me which I get since it was near the end of his shift and he was probably not having a good day but still I am a paying customer and deserve a little respect. Bathrooms were not clean as well. Overall I wish I ate somewhere else. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because of the worker in the back who apologized but other than that I didn't like my visit."}
