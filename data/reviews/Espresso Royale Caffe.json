{"text":"Now, I cannot really speak to anything at this place except for the chai. I LOVE it. I don't even like chai usually. I especially hate the kind that comes out of a box and tastes like spicy condensed milk - blech! This chai is deliciously different. It is nice and light, spicy, hot and just super yummy! I have visited this place many MANY times over the years and I always have loved the atmosphere and the location. It's a lovely place to stop in and grab a yummy coffee and read for a bit while watching the hustle and bustle of State St. The staff is friendly and fast and it's just a really nice local coffee shop. If that is what you're looking for in Madison - then you have found it here!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I believe food service is at least half about customer service. That is where I think Espresso Royale falls way short.  Make fun of Starbucks employees all you want, but I, for one appreciate a little friendliness with my coffee. Every time I go in to Espresso Royale in the 200 block, I feel as though I am a nuisance to the person behind the counter. She never smiles or says hello. Usually a short \"what would you like?\" I've tried to brush it off, but it's irritating!  I like their prices, and the proximity to my work, but I think I'll seek caffeine elsewhere from now on. Lord knows there are enough coffee shops in the area..."}
{"text":"Coffee in the morning, coffee in the evening, coffee at supper time. Ok, you get where this is going. You can have coffee anytime.   Obviously I've already had too much caffeine today and Espresso Royale is contributing to that.   I usually go for my favorite: small black coffee, but lately I have been treating myself to lattes because they offer almond milk.    In addition to coffee they have sandwiches, yogurt, fruit, brownies, cookies, and some candy for sale.   The baristas are fast, which is nice for when I'm already 5 minutes late for work.  They also offer different deals each day of the week, such as two-punch Tuesdays. Bring in your coffee card and get two punches for your order!"}
{"text":"During the last hours of my trip to Madison I thought I'd try one last coffee place. I should have realized my mistake when I walked in and saw lots of empty tables at noon on a Sunday. I had an espresso and a peanut butter bar. The espresso was thin, scalding hot, and had no redeeming qualities flavor-wise. The peanut butter bar was topped with dark chocolate, but even that couldn't do much to conceal its total staleness.  It's pretty difficult to make peanut butter cookie dough come out almost too hard to bite through -- these had clearly been sitting around for a while.  The counter guy talked a good game, and was very friendly, but that doesn't make up for terrible espresso (at a place with espresso in its name).  Visitors to Madison: do yourselves a favor and make the walk to Bradbury's. Or take a shot at Barriques, which I didn't get to try because 100% of the many seats were occupied."}
{"text":"I miss the old ERC. This new location lacks the charm of the old one, and adds nothing of substance to replace it.   Drinks: I don't know what they did to their tea, but it is no longer remotely drinkable. Their espresso is bitter more often than not, the foam for lattes & caps is loose and thin, mochas & hot cocoa need sugar added because the chocolate is barely noticeable. They've slowly declined over the years and have finally hit bottom. It's like they simply stopped caring.  Food: Insultingly over priced.  Seating: They crammed all their old tables and chairs into a much smaller space, making everything very cramped. There is still outdoor seating, though it's not really any different from the old place.  Atmosphere: Bland and corporate. While everything is relatively clean, it completely lacks character. There are no window seats for people watching and the cushy chairs and couches didn't come along in the move. (They ended up at Cafe Zoma, which ERC owns). Basically there are no more \"good seats\".  Staff: Nothing noteworthy. He said the minimum required and was pleasant. I had to add a bunch of cream and sugar to the latte he made to make it drinkable.  It should be noted that this is not a \"local\" company, as they have many locations scattered across the Midwest and California."}
{"text":"I was really dissapointed by Espresso Royale.  Granted, the only reason why I stopped in was because it began to pour rain and I really wanted to get off my feet-- otherwise I probably would have gone to a more enticing-looking coffee shop (this coffee shop doesn't really have an overt individual appeal.)  I ordered a Chai Latte with Soy and it was clear that not only was there no soy, but the drink was incredibly watery and served in a really awkward shaped clear glass that resembled an Irish Beer Mug or something.  Weird.  The drink was lukewarm and had no flavor, and the lady overfilled to glass so it spilled over the brim as soon as I picke d it up.  The couch was uncomfortable and there were rowdy university students sitting across from me talking loudly and using gross profanity.  Bummer."}
{"text":"My family was treated vey poorly. The second we walked in  the woman working was just... mean. She made us feel terrible for asking for anything. Even though we were obviously together, she rung up my drink and told me the total, like we were going to pay individually. I tried to use the bathroom twice, but they decided to clean both at the same time and made them completely unavailable. And, our iced coffees tasted nasty. They don't seem to care if they get repeat business."}
{"text":"This is the only place we do coffee in Madison anymore. Great drinks. Serious apple cider. The best part is the staff, though. Everyone is super nice and personable. You feel like a regular on your first visit. Local art on the walls is always a plus too."}
{"text":"All the staff here are really friendly, they make drinks fast, and if they ever have soup available do yourself a favor and get some  I come before almost every work shift I have."}
{"text":"Oh and get the weird maple candy waffles!"}
{"text":"Favorite coffee spot in town. The baristas are always incredibly nice and the coffee is delicious. The environment is comfortable friendly, the bathroom is always clean and the prices are great."}
{"text":"I just got stood up at the museum so I decided I needed something to warm me inside. I got a chai latte with soy milk because it's spicy so thatll keep me alive and sweet so I'm not 100% salt the rest of the day.   Although my beverage costed more than it would have from Starbucks, the relief it brought was priceless.   5/5 on the beverage of course."}
{"text":"The best iced dirty Chai ive had in a while. Solid iced coffee. I've never stayed to chill at the cafe but it has a pretty chill feel to it. I like that local coffee shop feel to it."}
{"text":"Tables, chairs, coffee, brown paint, a few paintings on the wall = a pretty generic coffee shop.  The drink I had wasn't bad, but there was nothing about this place that sets it apart. Everything is just kinda mediocre.  In short, this place is OK if you need a coffee fix, but just know it's rather boring on the inside."}
{"text":"Coffee= Great.  Black and white cookie= great  Sandwich= YUM  Little coffee shop, big flavor.  Friendly service, variety of coffee drinks, teas, and alternate beverages.  Not a ton of room but enough for me and my laptop. I have picked up a sandwich here before and it was always fresh, on REAL bread, not the flimsy stuff. If you're looking for tons of space for you and your friends this is not the space.  Want a good cup of coffee by yourself or your bestie, then YES."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Michigan, and my favorite coffee chain is not here in the Madison area.  I was very bummed about it till I stopped in here.  While my family was here to help me move in we walked around downtown and decided to stop in here for a little warm up.  My cousin got the mocha latte with soy (he said it was great) my mom and brother got their hot chocolate which they said was amazing. I on the other hand wanted to get something a little more fall like, I got their Hot Caramel Apple Cider. Insanely good!   I definitely plan on stopping in a lot more often. Royale Caffe has filled my coffee void!"}
{"text":"Love love love love their Caramel Vanilla Latte. You gotta try it on Wednesday:)   $2 latte Wednesday, cannot beat it right ;D"}
{"text":"Great drinks and great atmosphere, just like Lower ERC. If you're looking to study or want more room, Upper is definitely the place to be; even though it's only a few blocks difference, those few blocks generally represent the difference between the campus crowd and the working crowd.  Their chairs are ridiculously comfy, and have claimed many of my Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"I go here mainly for something called a Ginger Dragon. It's a gingery, lemony drink that comes piping hot. It is incredible! I seriously love it.  Their coffee is fine, and I've had several chai lattes here that were pretty delicious. The staff created special drinks are also usually pretty good. They offer almond milk for those of us who don't do dairy/soy, and that's definitely a plus.  The sandwiches are hit-or-miss. A BLT had pretty low-quality turkey meat and weird bacon. A Tuna Melt was fine, but had pretty standard canned tuna.    Baked goods are equally a mixed bag. Sometimes banana bread or a scone will be awesome. Sometimes a gluten free muffin will make me want to spit it out immediately.   I've had soup here once, it was Chicken Noodle and it was very mediocre. Like Campbell's Soup quality.  Great staff, though. Always super-friendly and willing to help you out. This location is always clean and cozy.  Please note that this review is for the Espresso Royale that is closer to the capitol. I have not been to the campus-area one in ages."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a delicious brew...coffee or otherwise! Clean with some delicious looking treats to enjoy along with your cup of joe. Loved the deep house music playing inside. Outside seating provides some nice views of State Street, The Orpheum and the state capital."}
{"text":"Found myself walking along State St. with family from out of town. The temperature was cold, and the sky was gloomy. Decided, after my cousin had moved in the day prior, that we all needed a little perk-me-up, and headed into Espresso Royale.   We were greeted by such a lovely barista, who seemed to be working alone. There were seven of us, and she was able to make our drinks speedy, but still with a certain amount of love. I had a mocha latte with soy, which was really good. My cousin opted for one of their fall specials, the Caramel Apple Cider, served warm, and it was SO GOOD! If there ever was a drink that encompassed all that is fall, that would be it.  To top it off, the bill actually wasn't all too bad. Much cheaper than Staryucks."}
{"text":"Love this cozy coffee shop. Great drinks and good atmosphere to sit and relax for a few."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee snob, but I may be a coffeeshop snob.  And for that, Upper Espresso gets my full approval:  Doesn't play the music too loud, supplies power strips so everyone can Facebook as much as they want, always bright and clean, pleasant employees, and Wednesdays is $2-any-size-lattes!  The baked goods aren't anything special, but can still satisfy for a reasonable price...yum."}
{"text":"I was on vacation at a cabin in WI with my boyfriend. We stopped in Madison for the day and stopped in at Espresso Royale to warm up and use the internet. I had what was hands down the worst hot chocolate I have ever had. It didn't even taste like chocolate. It was really light too. Maybe they forgot the chocolate? It tasted like nothing. Absolutely horrible. My boyfriend's latte was mediocre at best. I generally prefer to avoid the national coffee chains but in this case I really wish I had gone to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Espresso Royale is my jam. As an undergrad, I spent many days studying here, meeting up with friends, and otherwise enjoying double punch Tuesday. As a young adult (or whatever I am now), I try to stop by whenever I'm in town...mostly because you get a free any-size-you-want with a bag of coffee.   Being the thrifty but classy person I am, I refuse to drink bad coffee, and I love getting drinks. So, I visit my beloved Espresso Royale whenever I'm in town to satisfy my conflicting coffee needs. Being a bit of a coffee snob, it's not the best of the best around, but it's solid.   Come visit! I love them."}
{"text":"Upper is not as crowded, more spacious and quieter than its lower counterpart. Same great service and drink, the edibles are better here as well as the seating."}
{"text":"I like coming here because they are close enough to campus to be convenient but still far enough away to get way from a lot of the undergrads. I also LOVE their soy, yerba matte latte.    It's the only place around that I've found it at and it's always good.  Their staff is pretty good, but sometimes put bad music on or simply turn the music up way to loud - which means I have to put on my ipod in order to concentrate on studying.    Here you'll find a mix of grad students and undergrads, but also other locals.  Most people have their heads in a book, but a number of people are talking too.  There are several outlets throughout the cafe and they have wifi too.  The decor is pretty standard - so it's nothing special in that regard.  Interior even reminds me somewhat of Starbucks.  But I do appreciate the comfy and WELL-KEPT leather couches and chairs- clean and comfy at the same time seems hard to find in coffee shops these days."}
{"text":"This is about the chicken noodle soup.  I just paid $4.00 for a bowl of thin, salty, and what tasted like packaged base to which they may have added a few plump noodles, several pieces merely of diced carrot and ONE half-inch shred of chicken.  (Well, there was also a 1/4 inch shred of chicken in the bowl).  RIP-OFF!  What nerve.  I totally agree with the reviewer who wrote that the chicken noodle soup is mediocre.  That was being kind."}
{"text":"Along it's been a mainstay in Madison for quite some time, I think it is in the bottom tier of cafes to choose from.  I feel the espresso just doesn't deliver the punch and the lack of anything unique doesn't compel a customer to return.  Add this to the completely stark and uninviting interior and you get a very yawn worthy experience."}
{"text":"Longtime readers know I can't have caffeine, so I can't speak to the coffee. I did enjoy my strawberry lemonade, though, and it's a crazy deal - my medium drink was generally what I'd assume to be a large/extra large. It's a small location and thus cozier than its lower State Street sister shop.   Service was quick and the barista was adept at keeping the line moving. I also appreciated the teas being lined up and labeled on a shelf behind the bar - the herbal selections were separated by color so I didn't have to question what I could have and what I couldn't.   The outdoor seating is limited (three small tables), but we were able to snag one for our meeting and enjoy a sunny spot with a view of MMoCA. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Only place in downtown Madison to get a Spanish latte that is in par with Think's latte in NYC.    Wednesday is $2.25 latte day so keep that in mind for Concerts on the Square nights."}
{"text":"Their skim vanilla latte kicks Starbuck's butt! Occasionally, I also like pick up their sandwich for lunch. It's made fresh and quite good.   It's not the ideal \"study cafe,\" though. The lighting is on the dim side (especially toward the back of the room). And the music is obnoxiously load - I think they're doing that to discourage the long stay."}
{"text":"Very cool and comfy cafe. Has a very European vibe, similar to a joint you might find in northern Italy or Vienna, Austria. The old-fashioned tiles and ceiling give this place character and charm. Coffee and teas are very good too.   In short, ERC offers an excellent combo of ambiance and beverage quality."}
{"text":"Keep your eyes peeled for the daily special! They scribble it on the little chalkboard stands that they leave in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the cafe.    So far as I know:  Tuesday is two-punch day (for your punch card). Wednesday is $2 latte day. Friday is chai day.  For a caffeine addict like me, everyday is coffee day. (:"}
{"text":"Great memories of spending countless nights as an undergraduate studying away and will always cherish this place. Hot big cups of coffee on a cold Madison night while reading organic chemistry. Hard to believe how long ago."}
{"text":"If the campus Espresso Royale and the capitol Espresso Royale were sisters, the capitol Espresso Royale would be the mature older hip sister with a day job while the campus version is the popular underaged hipster wearing whatever is cool these days and probably on WUD. I appreciate the free wireless, that they take credit cards, and plethora of seating choices. I love the selection of teas, and I do not stand by the house blend but the coffee of the day often suits my palate.  The chai is fabulous and the staff on this side of State Street is WAY friendlier."}
{"text":"Just an average coffee experience.  Nice staff but not outstanding.  Walls and furniture in rough condition.  Good for regulars but not easy to figure out what you want.  Coffee was somewhat bitter.  I couldn't figure out how to get a real mug instead of a travel cup.  Scone was really good"}
{"text":"Decent, not likely to return.  Average coffee experience, nice service, but not outstanding.  Walls and furniture were in rough shape.  Good for regulars, but not easy to figure out what you want.  Staff was competent, but was not enthusiastic.  They should have had more staff, instead of one person in the morning.  By the way, don't drink the Maccha Green Tea latte--it looks like seaweed and tastes no different.  We were in a group of five and the experience was inconsistent."}
{"text":"Excellent chai, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. They seem to have some confusion when it comes to French sodas (some of the staff insists on calling them Amalphi sodas, but that's a totally different drink), but regardless of what they call them they're still good."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! The staff is alway attentive and friendly. They have a great selection of food and bakery. On top of that, they always have some type of special going on like buy 1 get one half off!  The coffee in general is also superb. I recommend getting a large iced coffee for only 2.85! The large ice coffees are also 32 OZ of beautiful. They also have the best red eyes and americanos!"}
{"text":"When I go to a coffee shop, my minimum expectation is that the coffee will be good. I ordered a Peruvian and was expecting the light citrus flavor with a nutty undertone of a freshly roasted bean. I got a burnt cigarette flavor of improperly cleaned coffee maker."}
{"text":"I was on State Street after the Farmer's Market.  I decided I needed a bathroom break and a coffee.   I stopped at Espresso Royale Caffe and grabbed their special of the day.  Almond Latte medium size for $3.25.  It was a tasty choice at a good price.  The ordering line was long but moved pretty fast.  The bathroom has a key so get that from the counter staff.  Bathroom was relatively clean for the time of day and the crowd.  My drink was ready for me when I finished my visit to the bathroom.    There are sandwich and soup options for someone looking for a quick bite to eat.  There are several tables for those who want to stay.  It's not the fanciest coffee joint but it's got character and skill with their drinks."}
{"text":"I've only gone here only once but my experience of it was awesome! First thing you'll notice is a huge menu of drinks and various cafe foods and snacks and for an inexpensive price!   It may seem wrong to go to a coffee shop, not order coffee, and then give it 5 stars...BUT what I did order was amazing! I decided on the goat cheese sun dried tomato wrap and it was only $3! It tasted wonderful and the vibe of this place is super comfortable and hip. Will definitely be back to try the coffee and pastries!"}
{"text":"As far as atmospheres go, I think this coffee shop is quaint and warm. However, the coffee was pretty good, but they didn't have sugar/milk on the side to add to your drink. I don't think I have ever been to a coffee shop that didn't have that...that's pretty standard anymore. Not to mention, the line was so long and they were so busy, I didn't feel like trying to bother them for some milk. We didn't order any food so I have no idea what that is like. Overall it's alright, but if I went back I would probably try one of the other coffee shops on the street."}
