{"text":"I go there often with my kids after chinese school on Saturday mornings. The place is always a mad place on earth. It's a good thing that they have more customers than the seats but there is no organized method to keep track who comes first.we went there today and waited in the front.  People arrived  late just ignored the people waiting in line and grabbed the table if they saw one. We were cut in line twice today. Finally we got a table but had to call the girl over TWICE to clean up then the third time for the menu. After my older one had few bites, he found a hair in the food, then another one! It was so disgusting! I called over the manager lady( seems like she is the owner?) and she looked at the hair that still embedded in the food and looked at me. She came back later and said all the chefs were men. What the fxxx! I would pull my hair and put it in my son's food? It was a terrible experience! When I got the check, I really didn't want to tip. But I still did. I wrote \" worst experience ever. Was cut in line twice; hair in the food \" on the receipt . I am not going there agin!!"}
{"text":"Great and very authentic-seeming Taiwanese food.  Everything was tasty, though if you aren't Taiwanese and are used to standard Chinese-American fare, some of the menu items might be a little strange to American tastebuds."}
{"text":"Extremely lacking from all angles: food, flavor, service, and quality. Underwhelming and passionless.

It's OK that the staff aren't from Taiwan but the fact that the owner (who's supposedly from Taiwan) didn't bother to introduce the food to them is just weird. How would you know what you're selling?

But silly me, I ignored the fact that the staff at the restaurant haven't tried them nor can they speak to the Taiwanese dishes.

This place gives Taiwanese street food a bad name, they brought it down, waaaay down.

I feel sad that I made an attempt to go to Mesa for this....just sad and deeply dissatisfied...."}
{"text":"Went into this place yesterday to try their boba drinks. I got a watermelon slush and my boyfriend got a vanilla latte slush. Both were SO good. They used fresh watermelon for mine and it definitely tasted like it. We went back today, I tried Pineapple coconut and it tasted just like a Pina Colada. Haven't tried the food yet but I can't wait to!"}
{"text":"Pretty good my office has been getting takeout here weekly for about 2 years.  The whole Mekong plaza is awesome!  Sometimes their meals are a little off from the time before but mostly they are great!"}
{"text":"Very tasty I had the house chicken and my wife had the kung pao chicken.  For desert we ordered shaved ice and the pineapple topping was sour from being too old or left at room temperature too long.   So it was good, but the desert was a disappointment."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant, and very convenient for Asian people going there after market shopping. The foods are not that special and traditional, but it is nice though."}
{"text":"I don't recommend eating here. The food was very bland, there is no fixing it with soy sauce or Sriracha. However the staff was very friendly and attentive. We also ordered Boba and that was actually pretty good. We ate \"family style\" so we were sharing sharing several different dishes. None of them were good so I suggest just getting Boba if you go there."}
{"text":"The service they provide is terrible and disrespectful because the waitresses would literally stare at you while you are eating. Like are they hungry? If they were they should ask the chef for food, hopefully the chef can make some extremely salty food that I've tasted (oh my goodness uhuh, so salty!!! That my whole table returned the food and asked that less salt is to be added). I am not trying to get high blood pressure, like come on chef please keep it at least healthy...(but I guess not, it's impossible), and chef, if you like to eat salt-flavored food I think it is about time you simmer down that salt bae act because it's just too unhealthy... Every dish was very salty and not very tasty, and nothing special as I have been to better places. Taiwanese food? yeah right Saltinese food I'll say. The food? I would not recommend unless anyone likes salty food. The service? They should be ashamed.

Also I must add, it was just so uncomfortable as they were standing so close and was staring at us eating. Aside from being great at staring, they are great at not knowing how to count. When there was a party of six, we asked for six plates and some utensils but they came back with four plates and no utensils. When we called them back to get us two more, they acted like they worked their butt off that whole day and hesitated to get TWO more plates. I was pretty sure they got some rest in between times if there were only my party and another customer in the room, while the rest of the tables were empty. My goodness! Then she came back with the plates and would look as if she was weary and tired from a 10 feet walk, and gives an attitude. It was not just one waitress but all of them were so laaaaazzzzyyy. Foods already bad yet the service just makes it even worse SMH...

I hope the restaurant will read this to hopefully improve, but I don't think they would know how to improve if they don't even know basic customer service."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  It's a nice spot to get a little taste of taiwanese cuisine in AZ.  They have bubble tea and some typical taiwanese dishes.  

Get the:
-House Style Chicken with fresh basil. (the sauce is a perfect balance of spices making for an interesting flavor combination against crispy pieces of chicken)

Also, everything is really cheap, so you can order a couple dishes and walk out of there without breaking the bank.

Always wanna come back for a quick, tasty, meal!"}
{"text":"This one of my favorites for fast Chinese food.
Spycy chicken salad and scalion pancakes are my favorites. But they have many great thinks. I cant think. Im about to eat. Bye. Come on porkbelly!"}
{"text":"When you need a non-Cantonese fix and the best boba in AZ, go here! We love the milk tea plain boba as much or even more than the food but havin said that the menu offers some great alternatives to our 90% Cantonese bias. Ironic that 90% of my Chinese friends now live and work in Taiwan, so I pay tribute to them each bite of the flaky beef roll and slurp of tapioca! 

Never a wait for us and quick fast reasonable dishes. The house chicken is another fave as the dominant cumin spices always stimulate our overly soy -oyster sauce dulled taste buds! Lol"}
{"text":"I had to wait 15 - 20 minute. but worth the wait. absolutely great food. dee -licious. great price too. 
They don't have all the item on the menue yet but they have most the items me and my friends wanted. 
We will be back soon. super food. Yum...Yum."}
{"text":"Taiwanese foods in AZ is quite a rarity and Taiwan Food Express does an admirable job representing their cuisine.  Some stand out foods include Tofu with Eggplant & 3 Cups Chicken (Basil Sesame Chicken).  The owners are really nice and friendly & the whole atmosphere feels more like home cooking than a restaurant.  They might not blow your socks off but sometimes comfort foods & friendly people is what you need after a long day."}
{"text":"tooooooooooooooooooooooo salty!! everything was too salty!!!
if you want to get some problem with your kidney, then you should come here everyday....
and the waitress can't even explain the food properly.. and were very impolite
she just said \"hmmm how to explain~~~~~~ \"  try to make you to think yourself!!~
during our lunch, other customers came in,
the waitress didn't lead them to any desk, it was fine, so the customers could choose where they wanna seat, 
however, they were kind of hesitated where to seat, THEN, the waitress said \"where are you going to seat???\" with impatient sound .....  
really made me feel uncomfortable to see that....."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant at Mekong. It's very rare to see Taiwan restaurant in the US. I usually eat taiwan style spicy hotpot and oyster cake."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant located in the Mekong Plaza. Loved going there on my lunch break and getting the lunch special. Lot of food for very cheap. Also great food if you're hungover. Orange chicken and any of their noodle dishes are fresh and amazing. Always my place to get Boba too, wide range of flavors and oh so good."}
{"text":"It's pretty authentic.  I loved the beef roll.  However, both my husband and I got stomach issues after our lunch there.  I think the oil they use might not be clean.  Well, a small dozage can build immunity...  That's the way I see it."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ and discovered this place. Located right next to the Chinese Mekong market. Food was delicious and service was fast. I had the tofu, mushrooms, and bok choy. Also ordered the pig ears. I know strange but once  u try this, you will be going back for more. Make sure to ask for them to make it spicy"}
{"text":"So delicious. Super affordable and the variety of food offered can satisfy everyone. I love this place, super great service too."}
{"text":"Upon entrance there was no host or clear directions, so it appeared as counter service. However, after ordering and paying at the counter, it was clear that finding a table and sitting down was acceptable also. A server would come over and take the order. Water was given to some guest, will none given to others. There were many authentic Taiwanese dishes at a reasonable price. However, flavors were not quite on point. Mung Bean smoothie was very good. Ba-wan was okay."}
{"text":"Had a few hours to kill after I landed in Phoenix on my way to Tucson for a conference, yelped Taiwanese Food and found this place.  

This is a decent plaza and the restaurant seems clean.  I ordered a lot of food and most of them are pretty delicious.

To start off, their tapioca milk tea is just ok, nothing special.  Pork over rice was kinda blend.  No minced pork sauce over it so the rice was dry.  Ba-Wan was above average.  And squid soup was pretty good.  BBQ chicken in the wrap, in its listed name on the menu, was nothing like I'd imagine to be, like the traditional Taiwanese street food.  But it was decent.

All in all, it was a good place to get fast Taiwanese food.  Not sure it there is anything better in the Phoenix area but I'd return the next time I'm in town on my way to Tucson.

The super market nearby is very convenient as well."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch with a coworker. The lunch specials are available on Sunday which is a plus. You get your choice of entree and it comes with egg drop soup (very thick with corn starch), an egg roll and fried rice. The food was good. I could only eat half and the price is under $6. The only complaint I have is that the water comes in a two sip sized styrofoam cup and no refills were offered. This is a good place for a quick lunch or takeout."}
{"text":"I'm Taiwanese, so although it's good to have a spot to get hard to find items like oyster omelettes and scallion pancakes. Unfortunately, it's nothing spectacular and it doesn't do justice to how fresh and flavorful Taiwanese food should taste. Dishes are greasier than I'd like and within this plaza, there are better places to grab a meal."}
{"text":"This place is a pleasant surprise! Skip the combo menu with the pictures and order the House Chicken and the Pork Fried Rice. Amazing authentic food with friendly service. Also be sure to get a Boba Tea!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I come here often for a quick and cheap, yet tasty lunch

Their mapo tofu soup is damn delicious. The food is really affordable and conveniently located at the Mekong Plaza which is close to campus (ASU & MCC) and accessible by light rail. Every time I walk in, the restaurant is almost 80% full. I tried their Kimchi & Pork Belly Fried Rice and the portion was huge. The pieces of pork belly were big and delicious. I wish it was a little more spicy but it was enough to calm and hungry person. Their drinks are not bad either. My favorite drink, or the only one I get from this location, is their Taro smoothie with boba. Give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad, service is good and bad, depends on what time during the day you are going. But this is the BEST place to get Boba in AZ!"}
{"text":"Awesome! It's nice to have a Taiwanese based restaurant close to me. Please save yourself the embarrassment of looking like an idiot by coming here, ordering orange chicken or mongolian beef, and complaining about it on yelp. Come here for the Taiwanese food please (bringing a Taiwanese friend is recommend- go find one). Traditional Taiwanese food tends to use a lot of seafood since Taiwan is an Island with easy access to the sea. I would recommend trying the Oyster pancakes. Their green onion pancake is also good, but a little \"fried too much\" for my taste. Overall this place has good quality Taiwanese food. Of course this place is nothing comapred to the Taiwanese food I've has in Taiwan, but Taiwan Food Express satisfies the craving!"}
{"text":"Ate here after looking at all the choices in the Mekong Plaza.  Tried their combination menu which included Egg Drop soup, spring roll,  fried nice and the the dish of your choice.  The soups came out and after two spoonfuls  I decided it was not worth eating due to the \"unusual\" taste and perhaps a bit of sourness such as when food is going bad.  I was afraid to eat it and gave it up quickly.  My hubby ate perhaps two more spoonfuls than I  (his palate is not as quick as mine) and then gave up on the soup.  He loves egg drop soup so for him NOT to eat it, you know something was wrong with it.  I mentioned to the server that something was really wrong with the soup--that it tasted funny and she gave me a half smile and walked away.  Didn't even take the soups away from the table until I visually prompted her to.  Perhaps not knowing enough English is the problem--probably.  
The spring roll was tasty as was the colorless \"fried rice\".  Yes, although it was white with some peas in it, it did have a pleasant taste.  The pork chow mein I had was almost all noodle with just specks of pork.  Pork is cheap isn't it?  I don't get why there wasn't much of it.   Hubby's orange chicken was made as spicy as he requested and was not laden with crust--he really liked it.  
It took a lot of coaxing to get the water glasses filled especially since it was a really hot afternoon.  
After my first time here, I think that the food is OK and the prices are fair.  However,  I don't think I will go out of my way to eat here again---especially after the bad Egg Drop Soup (which I believe had the potential to make me sick)  and lack of pork in my dish."}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get here is the Lake smelt fish with salt and pepper! Everyone who works here are really nice and accommodating. Everything I've gotten here was real good!"}
{"text":"This place probably doesn't compare to the \"real deal\" in Taiwan but I took my Mom here (who grew up in Taiwan) and we both really liked it.  We got the egg plant/tofu dish and that fatty meat with bamboo dish and we thought they were both pretty authentic.  For their \"small appetizers\" we tried the scallion pancakes which was OK.  The place is pretty small and we went the week of CNY so of course it was super crowded.  I don't know how busy they are during \"regular\" days.  We really enjoyed the service and the food.  Would definitely go there again and try different stuff on the menu.  Prices were very reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Good, decent food. Good portion sizes. Kinda greasy, but not bad. Their spicy wontons are on point, however."}
{"text":"This place might be good for drinks as I see a lot of people coming in just to order them. Food wise, very disappointing. The quality of meat (chicken) that they use is saddening. The fried chicken in our orange chicken dish was tiny, dry, and had more batter/breading than chicken itself...it was also over cooked and the sauce was burnt. Egg rolls were cold, not crispy. Service was ok. There are way better Chinese food options in the area. 

Oh and also, the menu placed on the glass wall says lunch orders are $6.50, but the menu they give you at your table says $7.50 for the exact same thing."}
{"text":"This review applies to the boba only, as I haven't had time to sit down and eat their food.

As it is for lots of boba places outside California, the boba is mostly focused on slushes rather than teas. 

The fruit slushes are of varying quality. The strawberry and taro slushes was excellent, while the watermelon slush was plain disgusting. 

The thai milk tea here is very bitter, tasting more like coffee than tea.

Eh, I've had better, but it's decent for Arizona"}
{"text":"Maybe Chef had an off day. Beef Noodle Soup was anything but. Beef was stringy and chewy. Broth so-so!  Noodles and bok choy were good. Having had aromatic beef broth the taste of dish water was the strong point. Less noodles. less vegetable and even less beef is acceptable as long as the broth is good. So a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Like cheap eats? Then this one is sure to keep your wallet/purse/card in shape. You can dine in or order out and your order of a few dishes will take about 15 minutes to cook for under $20 for 2 people, plus leftovers. :) 

I love the beef roll which is beef rolled in an onion pancake. The steamed rice bowl is a bit of minced pork with chopped cilantro and a nice savory sauce over a bowl mound of gelatinous rice. Give it a try! The house special basil chicken is sure to please anyone. And the chicken noodles is colorfully made with a spicy flavor."}
{"text":"I will be honest they are slow and have been since day one.  Now that thats out of the way the food is the best chinese food I have found in Arizona.  This may confuse allot of people so I should mention I spent two years living in taiwan so I may be slightly biased.  If you want chinese food that isn't changed to make white people happy this is the place to go.  Also if you like this I also recommend Lolly Cup at warner and Alma School (NW corner) Better drinks but a much smaller menu."}
{"text":"Ate here over the weekend while shopping at the Mekong Plaza market. Was very impressed with both the taste of the food and the staff. I had the Mongolian Beef with a Green Tea Boba drink - fantastic! And very reasonably priced too because I was able to get 2 meals plus two large size Green Tea Boba for both me and my wife for about $20. Don't expect much in the way of ambiance, but it's a great place to eat lunch before your shopping trip. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for great tasting food. The prices are very reasonable and the service is pretty good people are friendly here. We got the salt and pepper chicken and the pork bao for the appetizer. We also got the sesame chicken plate. Something to note is that the sesame chicken plate comes with fried rice and a spring roll, the salt and pepper chicken, however, does not come with any rice, but if you ask for it, they bring you a small bowl of white rice for free. The salt and pepper chicken was crispy on the outside with some spices- pepper and others and tasted delicious. The sesame chicken was sweet and was sprinkled with sesame seeds with a light sauce, the fried rice had peas, carrots and some egg. We went later on in the evening and there was no wait, we got served really quickly. Overall, a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to this Taiwanese restaurant and you can already consider me a regular. It's a small restaurant within the Mekong Plaza. It's a great find for those who are looking for authentic Chinese food.  

The house special chicken with basil is a iconic Taiwanese dish. It comes out in a medium sized pot with a flavorful light brown sauce with a side of rice. The shao long bao is a dim sum dish. It has pork and the inside has soup. It takes about 15-20minutes to make but it is definitely worth the wait. Protip: Wait for it to cool a little before you put it all in your mouth. The soup can be extremely hot! This dish is especially hard to make well, and they did a decent job! Another iconic Taiwanese dish, the famous beef noodle soup, comes in a large bowl. The beef is large and tender. The noodles are thick. I also got the honeydew boba tea slush. They come in either a small or large. The bobas are chewy and the slush was made with the powder flavored honeydew."}
{"text":"For authentic Taiwanese food, you wouldn't expect very good service, but the staff was friendly and greets you almost immediately.

I took a Mongolian Beef, Steak & Pepper, Beef Roll, Picked cucumbers, 2 small Boba drinks, all for $30- to go! My favorite so far is the Beef Roll since the skin is perfectly crispy and the meat tastes great mixed with the green onions.

Food is pretty good overall, and prices are fair. I'll be back to try the other tantalizing appetizers on the menu, as well as the dim sum, begging me to have a taste.

FYI, there is a $5 minimum to use your credit card!"}
{"text":"I've been eating lunch in the Mekong Plaza for a long time now and just found a new kickass place for my hungry taste buds to enjoy.

The menu here is very large and they have both Americanized versions as well as some more authentic Taiwanese and Chinese choices.

Came here for the first time and ordered the House Style Chicken with Basil and a Beef Roll on the side. They both had some really nice flavors and the large portions were probably more than what was needed before going back to work. ZZZzz!

There are several ways to get filled up here. Dim Sum, Soups, Appetizers, Sauteed Dishes and a huge selection of Noodles and Rice specialties.

Service was friendly and very quick. There are some photos available to choose from or you can just point at a picture on your phone like yours truly.

Can't wait to come back and try out some more of their tasty dishes. They even have some really inexpensive choices for those on a budget. CHOP CHOP!

4 STARS"}
{"text":"There was a void in my life. 

Having just moved back to Phoenix via Los Angeles, and living with my parents in North Scottsdale for a spell (which has terrific restaurants but lacks any kind of authentic Taiwanese cuisine), serendipitously stumbling upon Taiwan Food Express was exactly what I had no idea I needed.  

Situated in Mekong Plaza (a little strip mall in Mesa) Taiwan Food Express dishes out tried and true Americanized standards (teriyaki chicken) for your more picky eater, and meals of pig ears, spicy beef tendon, and oyster omelette for people who enjoy how flavorful and amazing dim sum can truly be. The scallion pancake with egg can heal inner pain and sadness you carry from the scars of childhood. 

So I guess what I'm saying is try it. Try it now. Right now!!"}
{"text":"Gave it another star because I keep coming back for papaya juice, plus they have very nice food too.  So many excellent Asian restaurants around Dobson.  It's like being back in CA!"}
{"text":"Cheap, good, fast Taiwanese food. Get rid of the Americanized menu and I might give you the 5th star. 

Note for people expecting awesome service here (and at many other Asian places). Don't. It's a different food/restaurant culture. Want something? Make yourself seen and heard."}
{"text":"It was late and we got there just before closing . First tried their wanton soup. The waitress  bragged about  the soup. The skin was a little  thick . The meat was dry was taste less. Tried their beff pastry roll. This was passable not much flavor and dry. We ordered two noodle dishes. They were both overcooked. I would pass on this restaurant  . The service was good otherwise  one star"}
{"text":"Whenever im craving dumplings in chilli oil or beef noodle soup, this place comes to my mind. The beef noodle soup is loaded with nice beef chunks and ill admit some of them can be a bit chewy, The dumplings here are good to order because they are flavorful. I do want to plan on trying the soup dumplings and the pancake next time!"}
{"text":"There are two restaurants that I tend to frequent at Mekong Plaza when I find myself in the area and this is one of them, the other is the Vietnamese broken rice place. Now as a restaurant let's get this straight, it's basic, it's not artistically decorated, it's a clean basic food joint and they have an alright selection of taiwanese style boba although their taro boba is actually pretty good since it's not too sweet. There are 3 items I tend to order at Taiwan Food Express and that is the Beef Roll, the pork sticky rice, and the Pork Shank soup. The Beef Roll reminds me of a Malaysian Beef curry roll eventhough this one doesn't have curry, the pastry has a similar consistency to Malaysian roti but with the beef in it mmmmm it's greasy and YUMMY. The pork stick rice is usual dim sum fare but I like it better than the sticky rice at Great Wall dim sum in PHX. and the Pork Shank noodle soup brings out the Asian in me, it's good ol shank with a kinda salty soup with bok choy in it. If  I told ya to try out Taiwan Food Express I'd say order yourself a beef roll it's just GOOD! :-)"}
{"text":"This popular little restaurant in the Mekong Plaza complex serves inexpensive, filling Chinese food fast. I find their food to be quite tasty, though it would have been better if they held back on the salt a bit. Service is friendly and efficient, the whole setting is very informal, and I do enjoy the boba they serve here. I'll definitely be coming back to try the salt and pepper smelt (I love smelt) and other items they serve that are not normally found in most semi-fast food Chinese places."}
{"text":"The service was great when the servers were able to get to our table. The girls were really busy, all but one told me \"not now I'm busy\" when asked for a plate. Understandable, I think it's a cultural thing. 

Anyway, The wa guay was frozen, microwaved and then served to us. Although I sent it back whole (was unable to cut or eat Bc it was literally a rock) they still charged us after the check came back the second time with the wa guay still on the bill, we just paid to get out of there. 

I wouldn't recommend or come back. Minnie's review is accurate too the place is overall dirty. My bfs shoes were stuck to the floor and I had found hair on the eggplant and our 3 cup chicken. It's pretty bad, I hope they clean up and make more space the flow of the restaurant is congested."}
{"text":"My family and i come here all the time its always trouble when we come here.. first bad services second the workers attutide there sucks thrid they just threw the check at us and when i tried to correct my order all i got was a bad attitude towards me fourth one group of young kids came before my family and they got a menu and serve first that right there is not right then the lady goes and say something when im sitting there ugh well never goinv there again..from the beinning they where good now they r poor services"}
{"text":"I haven't tried Taiwan food, and thus begins our adventure. We asked for a suggestion, since we had no idea. We tried the house style chicken and we tried the eggs with basil. The sauce is similar to  Teriyaki sauce but not as sweet and little more salty. Served with full garlic cloves, green onions, peppers, lots of basil and large ginger slices. Chicken is fried then covered in sauce. It was also served with a bowl of rice. Portions are large and we didn't need to get two dishes. Over all, it was a good meal. Can't wait to try something new on their menu."}
{"text":"i got a crazy boba craving tonight at like 9:20. my normal go-to place, the street, wasn't answering their phone and I had no idea if they were open or not. (i like how i call this my 'normal go-to' as if i have been a customer forever, let's be honest, ive been like twice. BUT i like it enough to call it my normal spot).

anyway, so i saw this place and decided to check it out. I called at 9:30 and the lady said they close at 9 but still had customers so I could come. i rushed my behind there so fast for my boba. i was not disappointed! 

this time i decided to get a few different flavors and put them in my fridge for tomorrow. i now regret this decision but what can i say? you do crazy things when you need a fix. 

so i got the following:
red bean- ok
green tea-  no thank you
thai tea- enjoyable
milk honey tea- yes please

I drank half of the red bean before it was too much and tossed it. it had a chalky texture? i totally tossed the green tea after a sip. and now i have the thai and my milk honey in my fridge for tomorrow.

the cons:
i spent $18, seriously, what the heck was i thinking?! 
they charge you $.50 per drink to add boba and I think it was room temperature? my drink was cold but the bubbles were not, i think they should chill them like the street does. it makes them way better.
and they charge to use credit so thankfully I had cash :) 

so, i will go back if they stay open just for me and i am desperate. but if  the street is open, that is my first choice. 

thank you for giving me my fix, TFE. you have a sweet spot in my heart.


BTW- boba goes bad in the fridge, it gets hard and gross. don't do what i did."}
{"text":"After such bad experience a couple years ago, now I have become a regular customer for some good boba drinks. They have improved so much from time to time. Comparing to other business around this place is still my favorite. The restaurant is kinda small but doesn't mean it cant attract customers. I have seen numerous people waiting in line just to wait to be served. The service is kinda up and down, depend on the mood of the servers that day. If the shop is busy I can tell they become a lil rushy and annoyed. However, I can put up with it because their drinks are the bombs"}
{"text":"Menu looks great but food is no good. The waitress' finger was in my soup when she brought the food to my table... Nothing like Taiwanese food... Not coming back any time soon..."}
{"text":"I love Boba drinks!!! I even worked as a bartender at a Boba shop for more than 2 years! I know and understand that every place name and make their drinks differently, and that if I want something made a particular way, I have to be very specific and communicate that directly with the person who make the drinks. 

When I found this place in Mekong, I was excited!!! On a trip to the grocery market, I made a point to stop here for a Boba drink with my husband. We placed our order for 1 Green Milk Tea with Boba and 1 Black Milk Tea with Honeydew flavor and Boba. I was the one that placed the order, so I made it a point to let the bartender know that I wanted Milk Tea and not slush. The server reply \"oh yes, it's good you tell me, we make our flavored drink here slush. But I will make sure the Honeydew flavor milk tea is the 'liquid one'.\"  Happy and glad that she understood exactly what I wanted, we sat down at a near by table and waited for a drinks.

5 mins went by, 10 mins, then 15 mins. I saw 2 bartenders make a total of about 6 drinks and sat them on a carrier. Then 1 of them saw I was looking, she said to me \"it's for a call-in order.\" I was thinking to myself, \"well... you have 1 walk-in order that only have 2 drinks and a call-in order of 6 drinks, wouldn't it be more efficient if you make my order first, or even between drinks, because I am already here??? Plus we have been waiting for over 15 mins!!! The call-in order is not even here yet... Where is customer service and common sense? 

When it's almost 20 mins, my husband was about to go up and ask for our money back, our first drink is made. It's the GMT with Boba. We waited for another 3 mins for the Honeydew one, and got a slush!!! I politely told the bartender who took my order that this was not what I ordered; I told her that we wanted the \"liquid one\", she told us earlier that she will make sure that's what we get. She first looked pissed, probably cussed under her breath, and than insisted that they ALWAYS make their flavored drink in their restaurant slush. Then she grabbed the drink off the countertop, told me she fix it and stomped away.

I have to be honest though, the Boba was very good. It was fresh and very delicious. As for the drinks, GMT was good; Honeydew BMT was way too sweet and undrinkable. (I suspected she purposely made it horrible, but I will never find out...) The customer service, on the other hand, is \"out of the world\" horrifying. Would I pay $10 and have to go through the whole experience again? No thank you. I will continue my search for a decent Boba place with better experience. I heard there is another one just down the street, and it's called \"The Street\". 

I am giving this a 2-star. Could have been an easy 1-star but the Boba is delicious and not many places know how to make Boba well."}
{"text":"Came here for some greasy Chinese food and def got my fill.  There are tons of people at this joint ordering all sorts of food.  Come hungry and order boba."}
{"text":"Taiwan Food Express is a great local option for quick Asian food.  For the same price as a plate a Panda Express you can get an entree, rice, soup, and a spring roll.  All of it is made to order, and there is great variety.

If you're in the mood for something tasty and spicy, this is a pace to try.

{"text":"Never eaten food here, only tried the boba. I recently got boba here and forgot that I didn't really like it the last time. I always order a boba milk tea when I get boba - it's such a classic and it makes it easy to compare boba places. The milk tea was really good but the boba was only the smaller side and not very chewy - the center was a little hard. Maybe it wasn't fresh when I got it but I remember the boba not being great last time either. Personally, I care more about the boba so i wouldn't mind if the milk tea is mediocre as long as the boba is good. One thing I liked was that they gave me a lot of boba - I hate it when I run out of boba and still have a ton of milk tea. So despite the great tasting milk tea, next time I will be trying a different boba place.

I came during non-peak hours so the service was very quick. Even when they are busy the wait for boba isn't terrible. There was a sign on the register that said $5 minimum for credit card purchases. I was worried when I saw this since I was only ordering boba and didn't have any cash on me. Thankfully they still took my credit card without any issue."}
{"text":"Horrible cuts of meat, weird almost sour after taste of chicken like its been sitting out for a while. For being in an oriental/asian plaza i thought the quality would be higher. I was wrong not ever going back. BE WARNED"}
{"text":"This place does takeout and has a small dinning area with about 10 tables. For drinks, the Thai iced tea, milk tea, and cumquat juice with boba are nice. For starters, the spicy wontons were very tasty. The meat inside was plentiful and flavored with herbs, while the sauce was excellent. The pork chops were a little greasy, but had a nice five-spice flavor that kept me coming back. The house special chicken pot is an excellent dish fit to feed two or more. The sauce is a tangy, light, and BBQ-like with an Asian style. For sides, the Szechuan green beans had a tasty chili garlic flavor. Overall the meal was very good and fairly priced. I have visited here twice already."}
{"text":"the food is decent (not outstanding) the prices are relatively high compared to the portions. 4 adults + 9y/o and the bill with $70 before tax ($14/head?)  That's AYCE super buffet prices right?  So the general philosophy of many chinese/asian restaurants is:  we know how to cook the food, but running a restaurant/business is not a pre-requisite.  Ok, so all my experience is working 15 yrs at family run mexican restaurant (yeah, chinese owned mexican restaurant, i know what you're thinking)

The servers were all smiley and polite.  Yeah, there's a language barrier (I don't speak chinese and my mandarin is limited to sheh-sheh) but seriously?  If you're going to open a sit down restaurant (v. buffet/server yourself counter) the patron should expect the minimum waiter/waitress duties be more than just placing orders on the table and walking away?  

The first thing we ask the waitress is to make the table larger by moving the next smaller table over which has just been vacated by the other patron.  She quickly clears the dishes and moves the table over and begins to scamper away.  But before she can go off and pretend to be too busy to come back, my brother-in-law quickly and politely asks her if she wouldn't mind wiping the said table before she leaves.  You could almost see the cartoon light bulb above her head illuminate and we could read the \"what a great idea\" look on her cute smiling face.

We ask for water and they only bring 3 cups (count it, 5 people?).  I will cut the waitress slack, because 2 of us ordered smoothies.  

My daughter orders a soup that comes in about an 8\" diameter soup bowl that probably serves 3-4 people (this is normal btw). The ever so polite waitress drops off the soup bowl in front of my daughter with a ladle style spoon and walks away.  At home my daughter has a pretty strong (loud) projecting voice but somehow she reverts back to her petite/quiet/shy asian girl personna (where did she learn this?  not from her mom or dad.  perhaps it's a cultural thing.  Ok asian girls, don't get your panties in a twist, you know what i'm talking about) 

In our efforts as modern asian parents, we try to teach our daughter to speak to adults in public ie flag down a waitress (albeit loud enough and with confidence) when she needs something (spoon, fork, water, take out box, napkin, extra order etc) But somehow she intuitively reverts back to her \"cultural voice\".  As the waitress leans in to try and decipher my daughters wispy barely audible voice, she politely and feebly asks the waitress for a smaller \"rice bowl\" size aka soup bowl so my daughter doesn't look like her dad at home while he eats in front of the TV with his huge glass pyrex serving bowl and matching serving spoon (random run on sentence, right?)

The waitress comes back and leans over ever so gently to my daughter and opens a menu and starts to point at several items on the menu.  At this time (and I'm not sure if we can take credit for this as parents) my daughter resists the temptation to let out a deep a sarcastic/condescending sigh which usually is followed by an appalling and rude eye roll.  I suppose this is a good incident, because it forces my daughter to finally speak up in her more audible/confident \"Could I please have a smaller soup bowl\" voice that it usually reserved for when she wants us to buy the latest American Girl knockoff outfit or accessory that is soooooo adorable.

We order xiao-lung-bow (XLB) and it arrives (30 mins later (normal because it takes that long for them to prepare the meat, role out the skins, crimp it with exactly 12 pleats and steam it for the scientifically pre-dermined time. Hello? they're previously frozen at some sweat shop tucked into a dark alley somewhere in who knows where).  Same routine, drop it off at the table and walk away.  I suppose it would be unfair for me to assume that most asians (sorry others) to eat the XLB with a chinese soup spoon to capture all the soup that is suppose to  come bursting out (i wondered why they called it soup dumplings).  I asked for some soup spoons for the XLB (and pointed at my daughters bowl) and she brings one (use the multiplication table sister, 1x5 = 5)  I didn't dare ask for 4 more but the rest of my party didn't care either way.

So, the cliff notes (pullleze!)  Decent food, crowded with mostly asians, pricey (coming from a cheapskate) and comical service.

You decide :)"}
{"text":"I personally love this restaurant, i visit there often with my family.  Being the fact that im was born in taiwan it is a great treat to be able to have some authentic Taiwanese food.  I highly suggest the spicy wongton, it is probably one of my favorite dish in the restaurant.  I really wouldn't suggest ordering any typical dish you would usually order at any regular chinese restaurant, after all Taiwanese food and Chinese food does have it's differences.  So skip the Orange Chicken, and Beef broccoli.  Because thats not their forte."}
{"text":"This place just tastes GREAT! It seems silly how low their prices too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and decided to try some Taiwanese food. I really like the area and the plaza the restaurant is in. I ordered a few items of the menu and also added a lunch special for my three year old son. The lunch special was about $6.00 and consisted of Egg drop soup (good), vegetable rice (okay), Chicken Lo Mein (Great flavor, but kind of greasy), and a spring roll (also good). I had the Spicy Wontons which were excellent and the Koah-pau which was excellent as well. The so called \"Orange Juice\" was extremely sweet and $3.00 (waste of money). 
Overall I was very satisfied with the food and can't wait to come back to try more of their dishes. 

Go here for great Spicy Wontons and Koah-pau. Instead of getting the Orange Juice, stick with water or bottled soda."}
{"text":"I was craving for some Taiwanese popcorn chicken and this was the closest place to me that had it at the time. I was on my way to work after coming from a meeting. I had about an hour, give or take. It took me about 10 minutes to get there. I ordered the popcorn chicken plate (comes with rice) and a taro almond milk tea and got my number and waited. and waited. and waited. ........ and zZ Zzz waaaaiiiitttteeed.... for about 30-40 mins! 

I had to rush it back to work and when I got to work I had to scarf down my lunch. I didn't have enough time to finish it so I saved half for dinner.

Despite the wait, the food was tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and exactly what I was craving for. And the rice was good! Hot, soft & fluffy! I love when Asian restaurants use quality rice! You don't get that too often at restaurants nowadays. It also came with sautéed bok choy and a braised egg. Yum!

I'll be back to get this again. But I think I will call way ahead next time or order my food and go grocery shopping and come back and pick up. I hope it was a one time experience because I can't imagine people dining in and waiting so long for food!"}
{"text":"Good food with a good selection of hard to find stuff. The drink selection is amazing! Love their green tea milk. Would give it more stars if their  menu was more uniform. Its difficult enough finding a good place to sit without having to poor through their appetizer heavy menu trying to figure our how much food should be ordered."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I really wanted to like this joint, being from Taiwan. But the food is subpar. And I'm not saying this as someone from Taiwan. It just wasn't tasty, period. I ordered the peddlers noodle, and the meat tasted dry as heck with no flavor. I had one bite, pushed it aside, and instead ordered the beef noodle soup.  Slightly better, but the noodles tasted weird. Service also sucked. Bunch of pretty girls who couldn't be bothered to ask why I didn't touch the first order.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"I come here for black milk tea boba, extra sweet. You will love it. I go to California to get some boba drinks but i still miss this place."}
{"text":"I had the sauteed sliced fish (swai) with green onion and ginger.  So good, fresh, wholesome, and filling. It reminded me of my mom's home cooking, or as close you are going to get to it at a restaurant.  Service was fun, fast, and friendly.  Nice people."}
{"text":"In my search to the ends of the Valley for hidden gems for great food I've found a pocket of Asian ethnicity in Mesa.

Mekong Plaza opened in October 2008 on the southwest corner of Dobson and Main. Formerly an empty Target store, it has been converted into an Asian mall with Mekong Market as the anchor. The plaza houses three Vietnamese restaurants, one Thai and the Taiwanese place, Taiwan Food Express.

If you're unfamiliar with Taiwanese food, that would make two of us.

While Taiwan Food Express does have a China-merican menu with typical offerings, I'd suggest ordering from the regular menu and the specials menu. This will give you food that seems authentic and interesting.

This was probably one of the most exciting dinners I've had in quite some time. Taiwanese cooking has many influences including regional, ethnic and cultural influences. So in order to taste the diversity, we ordered as many dishes as the table could hold and then some.

If you're not feeling too brave, feel free to ask for suggestions, the employees here know all the good stuff. Our server, Jessica, made some great suggestions as we pulled a feast together. And at these prices - nothing is more than $10 -- feast away!

The Spicy Wontons ($2.50) are filled with tender seasoned ground pork then laid to rest in spicy chili oil. They were so tasty we ended up ordering a second plate.

Not being able to resist any sort of food challenge, we tried the Simmered Pig Ear ($2.50). It was funny to watch the look on the faces of each of my dining companions as they raised the wiggly sliced ears to their mouths. These were more of a texture food than a taste food. The ear skin was super tender while the center cartilage was on the crunchy side. Challenge won.

Less challenging was the scrumptious Beef Roll ($3.95). A tender pancake rolled around tender sliced beef with a slathering of sweetened soy sauce was slightly oily, but nothing a napkin couldn't fix.

The Scallion Pancake ($2.25) had a decent crunch and made a great bread to go along with the upcoming entrees.

A less adventurous diner might order the familiar Orange Chicken ($6.50). It's good choice here. The tender batter covered fried chicken was accented by a thick and pungent sauce. The portion size was huge and dwarfs any I've seen elsewhere.

A favorite was the House Style Chicken with Fresh Basil ($6.50). This dish was made from pieces of bone-in chicken, then covered with fresh basil. It was plate licking good.

Pork Belly with Sour Vegetable ($6.50) sounded good, but the sourness of the vegetables was off-putting. Perhaps it's an acquired taste?

The boiled Hi-Nan Chicken Rice ($5.95) was tender, and when dipped into the garlic and ginger sauce it was out of this world.

Another textural delight was Stir-Fried Rice Cake with Salted Vegetables ($5.95). Each bite of rice cake resembled a large piece of rice and, while subtle in flavor, had an addictive chewiness.

There are so many dishes to try that it will take a few visits to get through the menu, but with prices this low and service this friendly, it's worth a few trips."}
{"text":"Good Pad Thai!

I have been next door many times getting shaved ice and never stopped in.... I'm glad I did. Only $6.95 for the pad Thai and it is really good too!

Stop by for a feeding and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Taiwanese food even though not much by way of atmosphere or service.  But who cares when the food is great!  Make sure you go with someone who knows what to order."}
{"text":"This was a bit disappointing. The food here was extremely salty. My parents are Taiwanese and I was so excited to show them Mekong Plaza and try this restaurant with them. We picked out a couple of typical Taiwanese dishes. Ba wan which is the Taiwanese meatball. It's supposed to be a soft mochi like outer dough that is steamed with meat, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms in a savory sauce. It seems like they have some ready made that they microwaved with very little filling. The result is the consistency of a rubber band. We also tried the mei fun which was only ok and very salty. The same goes with the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The broth was very salty and not tasty and he meat was chewy, not tender. The only item that seemed decent was the scallion pancakes, but it was as your would expect from any other Asian restaurant. We hope to find another place that has Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"the service of one of the girls (the big one)is very bad, very impolite. and the waitresses talked to each other so louD about online dating like they don't have work to do. I feel annoyed, and one of my dish was missed, did not bring to me until I almost finished. very lousy restaurant. will never come back. not recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Taiwanese food in Arizona! 
I used to think I loved Chinese food, and then we took a vacation to Taiwan and China. I realized that, while I like Chinese food, I love Taiwanese food! What's the difference? The food in Taiwan is more refined; the flavors are more complex and developed. The Taiwanese dishes aren't covered in thick goopy sauces, so you can actually taste the vegetables and meats.
If you are new to this place, I recommend entering from the outside door rather than from inside the Mekong Plaza. They have several labeled photos of the food that you might miss otherwise. 
The staff will be ready to take your order immediately, so you'll need to let them know if you need time &/or help deciding. 
The \"San Bei Ji\" (I think they call it the \"house chicken\") is phenomenal here!! It has a delicate balance between the Thai basil, Chinese 5 spice, and something else that we haven't been able to replicate at home. It's authentic, so be prepared to eat around the bones. We drive almost an hour to get it, and it's worth the drive!
We order the most unusual and adventurous dishes we can, & have enjoyed every noodle, rice, and vegetable dish we have ordered here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of those restaurants that may seem like they have non authentic Taiwanese food styled like Panda Express, but if you steer away from the \"meal deals\" that include rice, a meat dish, and an egg roll, you'll find that this place has a ton of gold!!! Try any of their signature dishes and you'll know what I mean. The more people you come with, the more you get to try! The signature dishes can be a bit pricey if you eat alone, but in a party it's very inexpensive! My favorites to get are the MaPo Tofu, Beef Roll (from the Dim Sum section), Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, House Style Chicken, or a combination of a few of these and a new dish I'm in the mood to try. The reason I give it 4 stars is because of the few encounters I've had with impatient waiters/waitresses and the few encounters I've had with not so clean plates/cups. Other than that this place is golden and I eat here almost every time I stop at MeKong to get my weekly grocery run in. Give them a try and see for yourself what a hidden gem this restaurant is!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food with reasonable price.  You can get the typical America Chinese food here too in case you come with less adventurous friends. Service was ok; efficient but not overly friendly. They offer full sit down service but you can order on the counter too. A bit confusing."}
{"text":"Recommend All the dim sum!!! Cheap price get good service and food! I like Taro slush. I saw they used the fresh Taro. I will be back next time!"}
{"text":"Got Rice!? Cause I need some now!

This place is great if you need a quick run for some rice. That's what happened in my situation. I ordered the Spicy Lover - cause that's what I am; sssssss haha! It was pretty much kung pao chicken with an extra kick!  I dig it.  It came with an eggroll, side of egg drop soup, and fried rice.  However, if you can't handle a lot of spice I would definitely recommend the regular kung pao without the extra PAO - if you know what I mean. All this for the price of $6!  Not bad at all. It's like ordering street food, but not actually being on the street. They also serve Boba drinks here, but I rather just run next door to the frozen yogurt boba shop.

The place itself is pretty simple and looks like a fast food Chinese joint for sure.  Service is good!"}
{"text":"i loooooooooooove me some taiwanese food, and after almost 4 years of living near rowland heights, ca - aka taiwanese food mecca, i think that makes me a pretty good critic.

i ordered takeout here - an oyster omelet, the beef roll, and spicy wontons - 3 of my fave taiwanese foods. The servings here are pretty generous, but there were only a couple oysters, and the spicy wonton sauce seemed to be the chili oil from a jar dumped on top (it literally tasted identical to the chili oil that is sitting in my fridge this minute). but the beef roll was DELICIOUS!!! highly recommended.

the family that runs TFE are super nice and friendly. i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like this place for it's authentic items on the menu. Well most of them are authentic but also the variety is pretty nice. You can get some pretty out of this world items here along with your standard Chinese food. The cool thing is they also serve cold treats as well. And good drinks like boba tea and slushes. It's an all in one shop for people that like variety."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in protest to the 3 star rating.  This place has some really great dishes - their san bei ji (house chicken) is delicious and an absolute must try at least once affair.  I've sampled numerous other meat an noodle dishes in my many visits and I've never been disappointed.  Service is okay, they aren't going to roll out a red carpet but generally won't ignore you either.  Prices are very reasonable - twenty bucks covers both me and my wife, with a little bit leftover."}
{"text":"The food has never been stellar here, nor has the service. I've even been asked to move seats for friend of a staff member so they could easily chat... 

The prices are decent but you're better off skipping out for something else nearby. I've been here several times, and each time I've left feeling sick. I gave it a good run, but all it gave me was the runs. :("}
{"text":"Looks can be decieving!  It looks like a boba/bubble/tapioca drink place but it is much more.  It is asian style cafe where they cater to both the togo drink customers and in-store dinning.  We were with a Tawainese friend who ordered for us.  Everyone really enjoyed the food.  Everything was delicious and pretty authentic for Mesa/Phoenix area.  I wish they had heavier hand with the spicies to really make the flavors stand out more.  I would come back."}
{"text":"We just dropped by on our way to the movies and we each picked up a boba tea. It was too sweet and the tea was not as strong as the one from Tea house that right next to it. I usually finish a whole cup usually but I didnt even finish half with this place."}
{"text":"After my 2009 visits, the quality has gone down a little bit. I don't know if they have changed chef or recipes, but some of the dishes I usually get did not taste the same started in early 2010. We have not been back often due to the decrease of quality in the food..."}
{"text":"I love this little getaway, the food is delicious, best potstickers in town, excellent prices for excellent food. :D"}
{"text":"Read about this little gem on New Times and just happened that we were craving Dim Sum on New Years Day.  

Ordered the Scallion Pancake (good), Spicy dumplings, (really good and 8 to an order), and the beef roll.  The beef roll was excellent.  Never had anything like it in any Asian cuisine.  It's a MUST ORDER.  Beef or Chicken with sauce wrapped in some sort of pastry and baked. 

For the main course we decided to roll the dice and the wife picked out the House style Chicken.   Chopped up pieces of chicken and lots of it, with some sort of greens and an amazing sauce.  This is a great dish.  The red sauce is perfectly seasoned with the right amount of spice.  Two things that would have made this dish even better...more greens in the dish and less bones in the chicken.  This is a pretty traditional dish so when the chicken is prepared its chopped in random pieces with a large knife.  This can cause small pieces of bone to be in the chicken meat.  Still a great dish.

You won't be disappointed with this place.  Definitely not your cookie cutter Chinese restaurant.  Especially since they are from Taiwan.

For an after dinner treat, take a walk around the Asian market around the corner."}
{"text":"Since I was in the area, I had to stop in for my Taiwanese food fix and I have to say even though the food is still good for what you can get in Phoenix, the format change to having wait service is terrible. 

First of all, I've never really liked the service even when it was order & pay at the counter, now they have it as a sit down restaurant. 

I changed my mind from having a large boba drink to a small and the girl behind the counter showed annoyance and asked if I will still purchase the large. Hmmmm, no- I want a small. 

Then the waitress kept bumping my table trying to serve the table next door. She apologized the first time. Then the 2nd, 3rd, FOURTH time it was bump, bump, bump. 

My bill was charged for the large drink- I asked for it to be changed to a small drink. That took a while. Then they didn't deduct the tax. I told my waitress and she lies to me straight in the face (this young 18 something) and tells me they don't charge tax on drinks because she didn't want to correct the bill. 

Totally unprofessional. 

Thumbs down."}
{"text":"The wife and I ordered a few things from this place based on some reviews from friends. The boba milk tea was good. We had the fried smelt, some fried tofu, the pork rice and a beef roll. 

The Beef Roll had good flavor but was definitely too oily. The fried smelt was good at first but then all of a sudden some of the pieces were very bitter...not sure exactly why...

The fried tofu was good but the pork rice did not have much flavor and was was dry :(.

Overall, I would hit up this place for the milk tea boba and some fried tofu, but that's about it..."}
{"text":"Service was really terrible. They advertise the place to be Taiwanese but the food tastes nothing like how Taiwanese food should taste. It was blan and without flavor of the island."}
{"text":"Eating here right now, the food was gross. After we ordered, the food was ready after 5 minutes. We got our food first before the water. Seems like they just warm the food from the microwave. Fried rice was cold and egg roll was cold. It was a bad decision, I wish we just went to McDonald and eat burgers and fries. Will never come back"}
{"text":"First off. The girl handling food behind the counter was sneezing directly into her ungloved hands, and proceeded to transfer food, utensils, and cash register all without washing her hands once, that is a warning sign of things to come of the low standards of this establishment. Second, the waitress was on her cell phone texting the entire time I was there, even texting while she was delivering drinks and food. I thought okay subpar Chinese restaurant standards maybe the food is stellar, but knowing it might be tainted with bacteria during flu season is not so comforting, and I am by no means a germaphobe.  I simply do not understand how this business can receive any positive ratings. Let's talk about the food. 

Here is a good summary. Lowest possible quality food used, and short cuts to everything. Although this is a casual, low cost restaurant, I expect the quality of their food to be clean and somewhat fresh. Maybe the many rave reviews here cannot taste beyond the thick soy sauce and msg to wash out the low quality food used.  The 3 cups chicken tasted ordinary, but the chicken had a bad stench (no, not from the basil) and the meat consistency was simply off. I understand 3 cups chicken is used with chicken chopped with bones in, but this dish was just a mess with broken bones and fragments everywhere.  The fried tofu had a unusual crunch on the outside, like the entire layer just broke apart like the sugar on top of creme brulee, very unlike how it is typically made anywhere else with various methods, steamed shanghai buns had no juice, skin too thick, meat was like a hard meatball, no that is not how it should be even, and no I am not comparing this to Dinh Tai Fung. The hot and sour soup had more carrots in it than any other ingredients. Although Taiwanese hot and sour soup is made with different ingredients and consistency as the Cantonese version , they somehow made it all their own, not in a good way. the carrot should be shredded, not big sticks of it. Pork should also be sliced, or minced, not weird shaped clumps. The minced pork rice was totally dry and had no picked veggies or egg. It looked like what I feed my dog. Although the review sounds harsh, this establishment truly needs some major managerial changes.  I will be eating at Henry's (either one of the two)."}
{"text":"For waiter/waitress service, have a seat. For to-go, approach the front counter. My favorite dishes are the scallion pancakes and the beef rolls. The outer pastry's slight crunch complements its filling perfectly. I'm only docking a star because I feel the drinks are a bit too sweet and the seats and tables can feel sticky when sitting on them."}
{"text":"Their combination boxes are a good value, rice, some protein, vegetables, and an egg for about six bucks. Try the taro milk tea slush!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because this is about as authentic as it gets for Taiwanese and Chinese food. If you are here for American Chinese food, you will be disappointed. 

My favorites are the eggplant and tofu, beef roll, and the beef noodle  soup. The food is awesome and a great price. The drinks are alright too- pretty standard for boba. 

If you come here looking for things you'd find at Panda Express, this place will not live up to your expectations, but for real authentic food, Taiwan food express is definitely the best in Mesa if not the whole valley. Also, the ladies running the place have been running the place for as long as I can remember and are super nice and willing to explain things on their menu. And don't be afraid of asking if you do not speak Chinese fluently. I don't believe that has ever been an issue here. ( I speak both Chinese and English but typically ask questions about the menu here in English)"}
{"text":"This place is superb depending on what you get. Having grown up and spent 16 years in Taiwan, I stuck with the dishes that made me nostalgic for home; Notably  (stewed meat over rice),  (beef noodle),  (fried dumplings) and the  (scallion pancakes). 

I can easily say that I enjoyed the food and that most of the food was as close to authentic as I've had outside of Los Angeles and New York and other cities with really large expatriate Taiwanese populations. The beef noodle found a little portion of my stomach that had not been satisfied in the 7 months since I left Taiwan. 

My only criticism about the cooking was that the scallion pancakes were far too doughy. I arrived at a busy time during lunch for them and it took them a while to first notice us and second seat us, but once they'd seated us their service was spot on and surprisingly fast. 

Despite this, however, the main attraction for this restaurant is the food. Speaking as a person who has been craving this type of food for a very, very long time I find it very easy to brush aside my perceived inadequacies in favor of their spectacular food; it is ultimately your choice to do the same or not."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, but the service is terrible. As soon as we got there the lady worker gave us our menu and asked us what we wanted right away. We said we needed some more time. She walked away and came back about 2 minutes later and asked again what we wanted when we clearly weren't ready yet. we were still looking at drinks but we ordered quickly since we were rushed we asked for 2 slushes & the first thing we could think of, chow mein. She brought 1 slush and a tea w our food. When my Tia tried telling her she wanted a slush she started getting outta control she put her hands and her hips and was really ready to argue over a drink.  my tia was out of words because this lady was really mad af so I told her that she wants a slush bc you know no need to get crazy over a damn drink so the lady walks behind the counter and says the her co worker \"she said tea\" and went on talking Chinese. After she brought the remake we seen she sat down to eat with her coworker so we were pretty understanding she was hungry and probably tired. We all finish our meal (including the worker) so she hands me the check and asked me to sign it. I do. Then this lady has the nerve to come back and tell me to write a tip. ( i mean I would have it's not a big deal but she was rude) and I was just like wtf in my head but I just looked at her confused and she continued to say \"tip, tip, write a tip\" I did tip her because I was just out of words and really confused about her behavior. I also work in fast food. Even on bad days I wouldn't act out half as much as she did. Like damn lady wtf"}
{"text":"I really like the teas I get from here, I just wish the service was friendlier. They appear incredibly bored and indifferent when I give my order."}
{"text":"This is the only authentic Taiwanese restaurant in the whole valley. Not the best Taiwanese restaurant I've had but it satisfies the Taiwanese urges I have from time to time. Love all of their food. I usually get eggplant tofu, three cup chicken, and a third dish depending on how hungry I am. Their meat \"ball\" is very authentic, though not as good as ones from Taiwan or even LA, but close. I go here often for a quick Taiwanese fix."}
{"text":"Our exploration of the eateries at Mekong Plaza continues. Having already sampled each of the restaurants at the food court, we decided to give this one a try. They always seem to have a fairly steady supply of patrons, so we were optimistic.

My girlfriend and I shared an order of Oyster Omelet  (#118) and Sliced Pork w/ Dried Bean Curd & Veggies (#411). The size of the portions was more than enough for the two of us. 

This was the first time either of tried oyster omelet, which is a standard Taiwanese night market favorite. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious, the egg and potato starch omelet was tender, cut easily with a  fork, and the consistency was just the right degree of chewiness. The sauce was more on the sweet side than savory, however it was yummy and complimented the omelet nicely. 

The sliced pork dish was perfect - the pork was cooked just right, the consistency of the bean curd and veggies was excellent, and the degree of spice was just right. My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, said this dish reminded her of good home style cooking. 

The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were reasonable. I'm confident we will dine here again.

{"text":"Let's talk about the positive - The food is decent. Most of the combination plates are decently priced and the portions are good. Look out for their giant sized onion cuts. They don't believe smaller portion cuts. Overall, the taste is good. 

The bad - This happened to me numerous times. Since I am a English dominate Asian guy, I find their service appalling. There have been a few times where I don't get served the menu. Those times, I simply walked out. 
As for the servers, if you are not a Chinese speaking customer, they simply ignore you. I noticed that many of the servers take their time talking to other patrons while I am left alone. 

This place serves a niche but their service quality should be better for everyone..."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here yesterday for lunch and I've been wanting to come for the past couple of months due to all the good reviews I've read.  I was a little disappointed with the food some, because I had super great expectations.

I loved eating at 3-6-9 in the Los Angeles and Silicon Valley areas and Taiwan Food Express doesn't compare to the restaurants in California.  There was another restaurant that did serve this type of food that I loved at Warner/McQueen, but they closed down a long time ago.

We had the Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) and I thought these were really small.  They tasted good and were juicy.  However, i'm used to eating these with a lot of sliced ginger.  We asked for more ginger, but they really didn't give it to us.

The onion cakes were okay, but I felt they were pan fried too much and they were very small and thin.  Once again, I'm used to bigger onion cakes that are thicker and flakier.

We had rice cake noodles or Nian Gao and the rice cake noodles were a big on the tough side, like they weren't cooked enough.  This was the most disappointing dish of all and not as much flavor as I last had it.  I won't be getting this again.

Lastly, we had Shanghai Noodles and this was good.  It tasted like I remembered so of the 4 things we got, this was decent.

Oh, and my mom ordered a Papaya Slush and I ordered a Lychee Slush Boba.  Both these were delicious and really good.  I especially loved the Lychee Slush Boba.

The prices were alright, so not an issue.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I guess at least it wasn't too bad, so I'll give it 4 stars.  The service was fine, everyone courteous.  So that is good."}
{"text":"The food is too salty and does not taste anything like the food from Taiwan. 
The overall appearance of the store looks dirty."}
{"text":"Service was less than desirable. It took a long time for the food to come out even though there was only another group of 4 and us 2. The waitress wasn't very friendly at all, or maybe she just had a rough day. 

I didn't expect much from a Chinese restaurant with \"express\" in its name, but the food was surprisingly decent. Beef roll was oily, but quite tasty, and good size. Pork chop over rice was just some simple seasoning and soy sauce, nothing spectacular. Taiwanese sausage over rice was good, but I think if you never had similar dish like this before, you might not like it since it doesn't have that much flavor. Soup dumplings were decent, but I think it's the only place in the area that offers this so I can't be picky.

2 of us ordered all of the above which came out to about $10 each including tips"}
{"text":"I ordered salt fried chicken, one bulk of the chicken had a bad smelling inside. I spit the food out. I am wondering if the quality of the food is good."}
{"text":"As far as Taiwanese food goes, this place is pretty average. If this place were in a more Asian populated area, I would probably be a bit harsher. However considering this is phx and the Asian food is not as plentiful, this place will get you by if you are absolutely craving something Taiwanese. If you've never tried Taiwanese food before, this would be a reasonable place to give it a shot.
Their boba drinks, though, taste just like they're supposed to."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some bbtea which was decent. The food looked and smelled really good."}
{"text":"My parents, who were born and raised in Taiwan, told me about this restaurant, that it had authentic Taiwanese dishes.  I had to venture here naturally, and went here a few times to get some Taiwanese food for lunch.  I've tried a myriad of dishes here, both Taiwanese and more generally Chinese-  oyster omelet, stir fried napa cabbage with dried shrimp, a fish entree with some chili sauce, Taiwan style rice noodles, Taiwanese sesame oil chicken, and some Hainanese chicken rice.  My favorites out of all these dishes were the Taiwanese rice noodles and the Hainanese chicken rice.  The rice noodles were full of flavor and were reminiscent of the rice noodles my mom used to make when I was a kid.  The Hainan style chicken rice had a nice ginger-sesame oil paste to go with the steamed chicken and rice.  The Taiwanese sesame oil chicken was a stewy concoction of slowly simmered dark meat chicken in a flavorful ginger-sesame broth.  I loved the broth, but you have to be hardcore Asian to eat the chicken, since it is roughly chopped with a cleaver and you will have to really work at getting all the meat from the chicken pieces, as well as picking out bits of bone while eating the meat.  

We also had some bubble tea- taro and pineapple coconut.  The drinks here are more frothy and light as opposed to the more heavier and dense drinks you might find at other bubble tea shops.  I like how they have a good selection of jellies to put in your drink if you aren't tapioca inclined.

I'll definitely be coming here again to try more dishes and to get some bubble tea."}
{"text":"Awesome Taiwanese food! The \"Taiwan Spicy Specialty\" is so good! Inexpensive and very clean."}
{"text":"I tried the Singapore noodles at this restaurant but I was not impressed.  The place has kind of a loud vibe too, and there are some language issues although everyone was kind.  I just didn't think the food was very good and that's the main thing----and if you are that close to Thai Spices in Mekong Plaza then for goodness sake go get that great Thai food!"}
{"text":"We have been living in Arizona for four months and have been desperate for good Asian food. Back in Boston we would eat amazing Taiwanese cuisine all the time and have been missing it.

Taiwan Food Express was a real treat! Despite the name it is a sit-down place with table service and has many delicious Taiwanese treats! 

The lotus salad and eggplant in garlic sauce were especially good. 

Mekong Plaza is a treasure trove of Asian eateries. Head there asap!"}
{"text":"This is the place I take my family to try Taiwanese food. We like their boba smoothie. Sometimes we would drive out of our way to get a cup here because I crave it so much. Most of their dishes are authentic.  I usually order stuff I do not want to spend the time making at home. I just wish they would have more Taiwanese snack type dishes that I could never find here or CA. (Like sweet rice sausages!) This is pretty much a diner, so service is basic. To me this is not a deal breaker, since I do not require to be checked upon while I am devouring my food.  In case I need anything like a second pair of chopsticks or another glass of water, I just ask for it.  The young ladies there are very good at responding to my requests."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is solely for their boba. For some reason or another, I've never eaten here (generally cause we're at Mekong for dim sum and stop by after, when we need our post-dim sum boba). Anyway, back to the point, I can't speak for their food, but I do love me some of their boba.

I believe they're one of the few places which offer red bean and green bean slushes. The hubby loves red bean and what keeps us coming back is that they really do blend up actual red beans, none of the powdered stuff. I usually go for whatever I'm feeling for the day and I haven't found one that I didn't like. My most recent discovery is their green bean slush which is actually fairly similar to their red bean slush in that they're both made from actual beans with the red bean slush being on the sweeter side.

Unlike other boba shops in the valley, they don't charge you extra to make it a slush. Boba's 50 cents extra and an upgrade to a large is a dollar more. Their regular runs between $2.50 and $3. Pretty reasonable and in my opinion, better than the boba shop next door!"}
{"text":"We used to come here quite often but this visit was just terrible. The manager was yelling at her worker and the food (we had oyster pancake and spicy wonton) was aweful. We won't be back for a long long time!!"}
{"text":"fantastic for a quick meal, i'd much rather eat here than panda express.. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the House Chicken today like I have for the past 4 years - and it was very dry, chewy, and over cooked. Obviously it had been sitting in the pot for a long time. I complained nicely to the server and she got on the phone with the owner then came back and told me that they will \"make me another dish but will not refund my lunch. It's not our fault\". I looked at her and said \"Then is it my fault?\" She says \"i know what the chicken tastes like, but we're not refunding you\". I told her I'm not hungry anymore. So I just paid for my dish and left. Like I said I've been going there for years cause I love their food. They lost my business forever now."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and dinner and would normally rate this restaurant 4 stars. My favorites were their house style chicken, combination fried noodles, and the beef noodle soup. The flavor is there and their price is reasonable. Today I came in for lunch, craving their beef noodle soup. As soon as I sat down, I was handed a menu that's new and improved, and very easy to follow. I was impressed. When the waitress came by, I ordered the beef noodle soup and asked for non-spicy. A few minutes later the dish was brought out and it came out very red and spicy. I decided to let it go and figured it was too much trouble to exchange it. I tasted the broth and boy was it soooooo sweet. I asked for a side of white rice to diffuse some of that sweetness and the owner (I think?) told me they would bring it out at no charge. That was very nice of him. Later I overheard him talking to another customer that they had changed their entire menu and ingredients. If the change is anything like their signature beef noodle soup I would be disappointed. As I was about to pay, I did let one of the waitresses know that the broth was too sweet. She said she will let the chef know. Hopefully they'll fix it! I'll still come back and order my other usual!"}
{"text":"I order fried chicken steak combination today. food is good, but the service is kind off. I got in, and sat there for while no one bring manual to me. there is one waitress occupied with other customers, but there is the other one just standing inside the counter, and watching. I looked at her many times...but she still doesn't want to bring the manual to me. I have to wait till the other waitress free to serve me...which took her more than 5mins....not amazed by the services at all....."}
{"text":"Saturday night, prowling around the Mekong Plaza. I was sadly disappointed by the Tet festival. Determined to have fun regardless I decided to check owhat else the plaza had to offer. I'm glad that I did because this place is filled with hidden gems.

I was drawn in by the window advertisement for boba/bubble tea. I had seen this before on one or another of the discovery/travel channel shows.

After staring at the board forever and asking the poor kid at the register for recommendations I grabbed a honeydew with boba. 

The drink was very fresh and did not taste as if it had added sugar. The boba was a fun experience with a hard to explain the texture. I would say its almost like gummy bear texture but in little round balls. After a few drinks of mine I recruited a friend to come and try another flavor. He got the coconut/pineapple which was the other flavor I almost got. He had zero complaints about his and liked it very much.

The food the other patrons ordered looked and smelled amazing. I wish that I had some more room in me so that I could give it a try. Their menu is HUGE and the prices are very reasonable. I want to get back here sometime with a decent sized group to get a large variety of items.

The front of the store was manned by a Mom,son, and daughter team who were all very nice. The lady even gave this little girl a free bubble tea while I was there.

This could easily be upgraded to a 4+ star if the food tastes as good as it smells."}
{"text":"I am originally from Taiwan, and this is one of the restaurant that I can safely say it's the closest to what Taiwanese street food taste like. I love it and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has some really good food options if you pick the right dish! I've been to this place about a million times, mostly for takeout, sometimes for dine-in and I always end up getting the same thing. 

This place has the BEST mapo tofu I have ever had in my life! Yes I am making a big deal about this because it's true in my opinion. I've been everywhere and have tried mapo tofu at countless restaurants, but this place beats them all. Their mapo tofu is soooo flavorful, it tastes so \"hardy\" and it has a hint of Szechuan spice, but not so overpowering where it leaves your mouth on fire! Hands down the best thing on the menu. I DO like to eat this dish with a lot of rice though, and I feel like they don't give me enough. I always end asking for more. 

Also what was very surprising about this place is their blended drinks. I get a Taro snow drink and it's actually really really good for a place that doesn't really advertise boba as their main selling point for business. It tastes for grimy and you can actually get real pieces of Taro in there compare to the other places that just makes it from powder. It was super delicious! 

I haven't really tried anything else there, I see a lot of people order other things, but I never go wrong when I order my stuff and I always leave happy and satisfied 

Tips
ORDER the mapo tofu, it's the best thing on the menu
If you're looking for blended drinks, get the Taro snow"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and figured I'd give it a shot. I've enjoyed the other restaurants in the Mekong Plaza and figured this would be more of the same. Boy was I wrong.

For starters it took them 32 minutes to get my food ready. A couple who sat down after me got their order and finished their meal in the same time it took to make mine. I asked at the counter several times about my food and got brushed aside with \"it's coming\" each time. Once I got the manager's attention it took another 10 minutes to get my food rushed. They clearly forgot my order... I'd probably still be there if not for him. I got a curt, insincere \"sorry it took so long\" and I was on my way.

The food was hardly worth the wait. One spoonful of their bland, flavorless eggdrop soup and I knew I'd wasted my time driving here. I threw that away immediately and gave the entree a try. The orange chicken was decent. Sort of what you'd expect from a frozen tv dinner that you pop in the microwave. I also had some sort of spicy chicken dish which was similar to kung-pao chicken. That was pretty standard fare, but you can get better food just about anywhere.

Overall, do not bother with this place. Literally every other restaurant in this plaza is better. Service is lackluster and impersonal. Food is bland and on par with a reheated tv dinner."}
{"text":"The Taiwanese dishes here are quite good..... 

I don't know what people are expecting when they go to a Taiwanese place and order Mongolian Beef/Orange Chicken/Kung Pao chicken and then immediately compare it to Panda Express

That aside their scallion pancake with egg was scrumptious and their prices here are just what a college student needs. 

I prefer this place to A.C.E. too

downsides~ boba not good as boba house, some dishes are off, service is very hands off asian style..... but you go to a place for what its good for and TFE is well worth the effort"}
{"text":"You can get a drink punch card here if you ask.  If you buy 10 boba drinks, you can get 1 free.  Ask for it!  I like to get peach black tea with boba added to it.  The total is $3.45 for a small and $4.45 for a large.  These drinks seem to have extra sugar in it besides the sugar in the tapioca pearls and the sugar in the tea, so ask for less sugar.

Whenever I go to this restaurant, there seems to be a lot of Mandarin-speaking people, and I wonder if they get special deals.  I found out about the punch card from someone who is friends with the owner.  It seems like most patrons know each other.  I have visited a few times, and sometimes there is a variance on prices, so make sure you check the menu and add up everything in your head.

I love getting Xiao Long Bao (Steamed Pork Dumplings - $3.95 - #114).  These broth-filled dumplings are amazing - obviously, they are not as amazing as ones in Asia or Chinatown, but they suffice for my xiao long bao cravings.  I also like Taiwan Food Express for their different kinds of greens, but I would hope they would have that many options being connected to an Asian supermarket and all.  So overall, great experience from this informal diner, but not the best I have ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Last night me and my friend had the best time at dinner that I think I've had! I have to say that have best boba in this town and all dim sum dish i will recommendation for everyone, reasonable price can make you have a East-Asian food trip!!!
My personal favorite is fish with pineapple, beef triple boba tea and all dim sum recipes!"}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted about this place. There are not too many Taiwanese restaurants in the Valley and I wish them success. I will probably go back. But our experience was mixed. 

We ordered quite a few different things to get a sampling and two dishes were outstanding--the spicy won tons and spicy chicken and noodles: cold noodles with chicken, a few veggies and maybe a little peanut sauce mixed into the spice. Carol's seafood soup was unremarkable. The pork chop we ordered for my son was okay. Our niece had one of the Americanized entrees and it was--well--Americanized. 

The service was decent, not as bad for us as some others here. I think I was overcharged though. My bill was $47 and I could only figure out $37 worth of food and taxes. I think an extra $10 was stuck onto the bill. I'll assume it was an accident. I should have checked when I was still in the restaurant.

Mekong Plaza is, overall, a great addition to the Phoenix area. I've loved the restaurants and the grocery is cool also. This is the only Taiwanese place there so I hope they iron out the kinks and have a great run."}
{"text":"Love the food n the service ;) the lady over there is really nice!!! Try the taro mike ()"}
{"text":"I'm going to start being tougher on my reviews, starting now. 

This place WOULD NOT give me a water cup larger than a 6 oz Styrofoam cup. We waited 20+ minutes for our lunch orders of orange chicken to come to our table at Taiwan Food EXPRESS. The orange chicken then tasted like liking orange peels. 

I was unhappy when my bill came."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. We ordered Fried Chicken with Salt and Pepper, Taiwanese Sausage, and Taiwanese Hot Pot. We also got a veggies fish. We like it and ate them all.

Good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"We ordered some typical Taiwaness dishes such as shaved ice, fried chicken steak, and Si-deng pork. However, we couldn't be more disappointed. Their shaved ice was a joke. You wouldn't get any appetite just by looking at it. The rest stuff was just mediocre."}
{"text":"pretty decent taiwan food in the valley. We go there every couple weeks, usually order to go and then take our time for the grocery shopping, then came back to pickup. all kinds of delicious food to try"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Arizona for Taiwanese food. I find the servers are always pretty friendly and they are very fast! If you look around there are groups of ASU Chinese students that come here because its inexpensive and the food is good. 

There are two menus one for your Panda loving friends and the other is for authentic Taiwanese food. 
When I go here I like a lot of the appetizers that are generously sized . My favorites here are:
-the Beef roll that has seasoned beef and sweet hoisin sauce
-Crispy Tofu
-Tofu with Shitake Mushroom & Bok choy  
-Spicy Eggplant with garlic sauce 
-Oyster Omelette
-Pork Chop rice plate for lunch 

You really can't  go wrong here there is something for everyone. Another big plus  they also have boba! Their jasmine milk tea and Black milk tea are good and not too sweet."}
{"text":"I come here when I miss my moms home cooking. We had a rocky start at first with our first waitress but after talking to the owner we cleared any bad tension and now I come here all the time and love it. Get the fried chicken but prepare to wait a while because they made it fresh. Prices are really cheap. Their boba is fresh and doesn't have any artificial powders in it either. I wish they had stinky tofu but I always get the minced pork over rice noodle soup."}
{"text":"Best Taiwanese food in the valley! I've been coming here for years and it's amazing every time! I love the orange chicken. Their milk tea boba is the best I've ever had! The service is always excellent as well. If you're looking for delicious, authentic Taiwanese food this is it!"}
{"text":"They are very friendly here and willing to accommodate your food order to your liking..only thing is the food was not all that great which we were kinda bummed about because it did look very good.

{"text":"Not bad for taiwan food. The dumplings were pretty good though. The service could have being better....they need to work on customer service. The eggplant and tofu dish was interesting. The seafood pancake wasn't that impressive. Hey...i was very hungry....so I eat anything."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star, I would! I've been coming here for some time now. Food is usually good, every now and again it's been bad. Service always is off and on. The younger waitresses are always rude and give you attitude. So the problem today was....Me and my husband paid for our food, I decided to not tip this time around (Sue me), I sign my receipt the waitress then looks at it looks back at me and says \"was there a problem with your service today?\" I said no there was not. She then starts harassing us about the tip and trying to force us to tip her. To the point where she wouldn't let us leave unless we tipped her and stood in front of the door not allowing us to leave. This has to be the worse waitress in history and I've never had such a rude ending to a potential decent lunch. I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone. Unless you like to be harassed, but hey to each their own. I will NEVER go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I too stood in line for 20-25mins and gave up, but went back later in the week and was pleasantly surprised.  The first time and bad experience was the 2nd day they were open and they were clearly overwhelmed.

I had the Taiwanese Rice Noodles and they were fantastic.  Great price too, $4.95.  I enjoyed my noodles with a lychee slush with boba and was one happy guy.

They do not have every item on the menu, only about 1/5 while they are getting started.  I look forward to the full menu."}
{"text":"Well I must have chosen the worst dish that day. How sad, this place has a wonderful set of authentic tiwanese items. I ordered the spicy wonton ( Which strangely had \"Ma La\" sause/oil poured on top of it. Now I am a sucker for mala so I did like the dish even though the pork and shrim inside was rather bland ( me thinks an addition of some garlic/leek or ginger might do the trick). Also ordered the Taro Boba (without ice) which was fine , a tad on the sweet side for my taste but to each his/her own.

The Hainan chicken was however just horrible. The chicken was definitely semi rancid and both the rice and chicken were soaking in oil. I was hoping the ginger,garlic, onion sauce would redeem this but sadly that too was dissapointing.

an extra star for the potential. I hope to go back and order a more safer choice and hopefully redeem my impression of this high potential joint."}
{"text":"I went here to 'do a project' with a friend (the project did not get done at all, but I digress) and he's from Taiwan so that was cool. We ordered so much food and it was so cheap! that was pretty awesome. We got the Taiwan noodles, which are rice noodles with some veggies like carrots and sprouts, and it was topped with some ground pork. It was pretty good, the noodles were a little hard to bite through, but the flavor was good. Then we got the pork chops, which were really good. They are breaded and fried and had a lot of flavor. We got the fried dumplings which were really good. They were crunchy on the bottom and soft on the top. It could have been more flavorful, but it was still good. Plus the potsticker sauce had little green onions in it, which is always good. We got green onion pancakes which were the best part! They were crispy, yet chewy, and had a great flavor.... so yum. Finally we got shaved ice with boba, red bean, grass jelly, and condensed milk. I've never had anything like that before, but it was pretty good. So overall, it was good and I would come back. The service wasn't too bad like others have said, but I could see how it might be if the place was busier."}
{"text":"Being from Taiwan, and having visited Taiwan last early this year, I was really looking forward to some good Taiwanese food.

Came here to Phoenix on one of my business trip last week.  Ordered the beef noodle soup, and oyster omelet.  Wanted some soup dumplings, but the waitress said it would take awhile....not sure what that meant, so didn't get to try that.

The food came quickly, within 5 min.  The beef noodle soup was OK as the soup was very bland.  You can tell it was not stewed, but simply a basic soup that they may have added some soy sauce to make it brown colored?  Keep in mind that it wasn't bad, but just didn't have any beef flavor that I was expecting.  The noodles, the meat, and bok choy were all OK.  Just didn't have that traditional Taiwanese style that I was expecting.

The oyster omelet was interesting.  The oyster used must be quite small as I barely tasted them.  The sauce was actually OK.  So the real issue here is the vegie used.  Typically, they are lettuce or some light green vegies, but in this case, these vegies are have stalk on them.  I'm not exactly sure what they were, but just didn't taste right.  Then there is the excessive amount of corn starch used.  The edges tasted great, but towards the center, I tasted several raw corn starches, which was not very pleasant.  

Overall, I had high expectation, but was let down with this experience.  I do want to comment that the 2 girls in front were helpful and friendly.  But whoever is back there cooking, perhaps they can do a little better next time.  I will try again on my next trip as I do want to try their soup dumplings.  If so,  I will update the review."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and very reasonably priced. My husband and I are foodies and their dishes are more authentic asian which can sometimes be surprising for western tastebuds. We loved everything we got with the exception of the ma po tofu (a standard dish we often get at other Asian restaurants). While the flavor was by far the best, they do use an herb/seasoning that makes your mouth numb. The waitress said it was white pepper, but I'm not sure that is accurate. I do know that is not unusual in some Asian cuisines, it just wasn't my cup of tea. 

All others: scallion pancakes, flat noodles with beef, oyster omelette, and special bok choy with shiitake mushrooms were excellent. A must try if you love authentic Taiwanese food!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my wife.  

I ordered and ate a lunch special of kung pao chicken.  It was good.  It was Chinese food for me.

This is overall a casual restaurant.  Not much today otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is good. We ordered fried chicken,meat balls,beef with egg roll and rice,spicy dumplings and too much for 2person! Especially the fried chicken,better than pork. We will try some other things next time."}
{"text":"I have literally just moved to the Phoenix area from the East Coast and was exploring the area for good Chinese/Taiwanese food. Stumbled upon this place after reading about it on Yelp. I would have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. This was not too far off from food that you would actually get in Taiwan (and I've been there 3 times).

I ordered the Chicken Leg over rice and the outside is perfectly crisp while the inside was quite moist. Tea egg was pretty good and standard. The only thing that could have made this a bit better was to include mustard greens. Most Taiwanese restaurants I've been to include this with the \"meat over rice\" Taiwanese dishes. However, it did include some stir fried veggies that were pretty good.

Pig ear appetizer was good too. Definitely had a bit of kick to it so it's not for those who can't handle spiciness.

For drink, we ordered passion fruit slush. It was really refreshing and didn't taste of nasty artificialness that you see from other places. Girlfriend, who's from the Bay Area and definitely knows her Asian drinks, approved as well.

Service was meh. The girl didn't smile much, and gave us a check before we were finished. But hey, I guess that's standard for most Asian restaurants, right?"}
{"text":"Myself as an international student from china, I was bored in China and grow up all the way from 0 to 18 years old and I know what the restaurant in China looks like and what the food taste like. By looking through the reviews they have of Taiwan food express, I find out something pretty interesting. People from all nations go and try the foods there; they have different ideas of food culture based on their background. Some people may think the service they have there is not very good and even not friendly. That's really funny, in fact the people work there is pretty friendly and they know exactly what they are doing. That is exactly what has happened in the real Chinese restaurant. Mostly, when you go to the Chinese restaurant, the server will gave you a menu and it take time for you to choose the dish you want so the server will not stand next to you all the time and they may leave. After you choose the food you want, you can just raise your hand or call the server and then they will come and write down the food you want. That is the way we do in China, that is one kind of culture.

For the food they have there, most people done the review said it taste pretty good and I am absolute agree with that. They order the real Chinese food instead of the American Chinese food or something else. There in one guy said that he feels pretty disappointed when he wants to order the orange chicken and Mongolia beef when he comes there. That make sense to, because most native people may thought what we have or eat in China is orange chicken or something like that. That's not true. In china, we have 8 different styles of food which were from different province. I can even say that different province have absolutely different food. There are more than thousands of foods you can find and eat in China not only the orange chicken and Mongolia beef."}

I will come back next time and try different things.

BTW, Boba is really good."}
{"text":"I've been to Taiwan once already, and am heading back there again in a few months.  Mostly, I adore the night market fare.  The menu here had me soooo excited.  I was with my fiancee, and we ordered the fried squid, tan tan mien, scallion pancake, and a cup of milk tea.  The milk tea and squid were very close to what we had at the markets.  However, I was extremely disappointed in noodles.  I'm not Taiwanese, but of the many times that I have ordered this dish, it has been spicy.  This was not...it lacked much of any flavor.  The scallion pancakes served only as a belly filler.  I may return, b/c there are so many other dishes to try, but will not be repeating any of my last order."}
{"text":"Inside the Mekong Plaza serving fast food and boba.  

Have never had the food there but this is where we get the boba which is always good and fast.

I always get the strawberry slush without boba which is so good just be careful not to consume to quick which will give you brain freeze. 

My daughter lives the milk tea with boba and is addicted to this place. 

Friendly workers and pretty clean for a chinese restaurant. 

Will come back again for more"}
{"text":"We stopped by to get a Boba drink before heading to get some Asian groceries. I ordered a Taro Boba milk tea...I have to say...it was a bit too sweet for me. I've been here , however, for dinner. Their prices are reasonable and I do enjoy their food. I will still come here for food but probably not for the Boba drink. Great service though with authentic Taiwanese food"}
{"text":"loooovvveeeee their boba! I come here principally for the tea, but the food is good too. The prices are very good (nothing over 8 bucks, many dishes for under 4) They have quite a variety of dishes, I haven't been too adventurous, but I would like to come back and have some of the noodles. I have had shrimp and broccolli, which was excellent, along with a scallion pancake, which is nothing like a Korean scallion pancake, but it's still good. Our server was very nice, she explained which dishes might be too salty and which dishes are more popular. I like nice people like that!

It is a little small in there, but it is sort of meant to be fast food...you can sit and be served though. 

Anyways, as I said, I ALWAYS stop in for boba after shopping at the market. But every now and then it makes for a good, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"This is the first time I come to this restaurant. The food was amazing. It is family owned  and it really shows on the quality of the food. I ordered the crab puffs and chicken pot stickers as an appetizer. They were amazing!! I also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and it was not like any other one I have had. It was delish...... I will be coming here again. Oh and don't forget to order the lemonade!!"}
