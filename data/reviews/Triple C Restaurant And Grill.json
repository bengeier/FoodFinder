{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The jerk chicken is phenomenal  and the owner is always around and very friendly. I will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Husband and I wanted to try something different and we literally just rode around to find a locally owned restaurant. We ran into Triple C Restaurant & Grill and was excited to see it was Caribbean food. We both ordered Curried Chicken to go and it came with cabbage, rice and peas and plantains. The food is absolutely delicious! The BEST Jamaican food I have had in the States without having to go to Jamaica. You get a lot of food in the small plate. So I imagine with the large you could definitely split. We also ordered beef meat patties and cod fritters, both really good as well. Friendly service and wait isn't long. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My goodness this was good! First time I went I met the owner and he was a cool guy! I loved the curried chicken and will be back with my girlfriend this time!"}
{"text":"So after a co-worker told me about this place, I knew I had to go and check it out...I ordered a large Curry Chicken plate and my my my, I ate off of it for two days.  I ordered pretty late so they were out of white rice and I got the yellow rice.  I wasn't too big of a fan of the yellow rice. Nor am I a fan of plantains so I didn't have it on my plate... It had a nice level of spice for me and made me want to go home and slap all of my kin folks lol.  Winston the owner noticed I was new to his place and I like that he pays attention to who is coming to his place.  I will be returning and the dishes are reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I have not had real Caribbean food in years. My friend at work told me about this place and I had to check it out! When I asked Wiston ( yes I'm on a first name bases with the guy that works and owns it) if they could make my curry chicken spicy? Which they did I also got a Jamaican beef patty. Let me tell you this food was sooooooo good. Next time I will take some pictures to post. But definitely worth a visit!"}
