{"text":"Hands down favorite all time thrifting experience. Bizarre. Unsettling. Cheap. The Best of Montreal. Has become cleaner more organized in the last few years. (I miss the scrooge mcduck pool of vintage clothes in the back but not the bedbugs;)  Cafe offerings have grown too. A great afternoon trip even if you're not particularly looking for anything. The huge trippy basement is stuffed full of costume rentals. They also carry local designers. If youre into vintage or strange alternative shopping experiences dont miss this place!"}
{"text":"Got an h&m sweater for only 5$ plus tax. I gotta say it's one of my all time favorites. The store has a strange smell, but the staff is really nice! When you enter, they give you a little snack (tea, popcorn, etc). My favorite vintage store: affordable, nice clothes."}
{"text":"Amazing collection of vintage with really good prices. Cafe also has good food and drinks"}
{"text":"If you are a hippy, don't mind wearing dusty old clothes and taking time to find a good stuff, it's a place for you.  It is a very young unique colourful messy place. Some people would love and some would dislike it.  I personally find that these items in the store were overpriced even though they weren't clean and the quality wasn't there.  20$ for an old Skirt? No thanks.  Too expensive for used clothes though a very cool atmosphere, good coffees and lovely store dog."}
{"text":"In three short days in Montreal I visited Eva B's twice. The samosas, chocolate cookies and cool stuff - and the Monsieur behind the counter and all the staff are worth the visit. Must see if you like second hand."}
{"text":"This store has been a favorite of mine since I popped in a year ago and realized I stumbled upon a diamond in the rough. It's a beautiful web of organized vintage chaos. I've found vintage dresses , leather pants fox faced flats and so much more. It's the perfect place to find a unique piece or buy supplies for a project. The man who runs the place is very particular about the pieces and everything is in really great condition and sold for very low prices . They have ice cream, coffee, clothes and more.   I don't live near Montreal but every time i visit I make sure i stop by! Eva B is without a doubt the most diverse and inexpensive vintage collaboration I've ever experienced ! Definitely worth the trip ;)"}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for a few days and found a local to take me thrift shopping. What a find this place was! It is impossible to categorize it; like a thrift store but so much more. This place is completely novel! From the friendly staff greeting us with free hot cider and spicy popcorn to nibble as we shopped, to the classic punk music playing throughout, to the one-of-a-kind vintage finds and the great deals on the samples, AND the large room with racks of great deals on used clothes, I was in heaven. If I hadn't already blown most of my money at the Village de Valeur and the other conventional thrift store we went to, I'd have bought more. Even if you don't buy anything, it's an experience. Oh, and they have samosas for a dollar. What? at a clothing store? Amazing."}
{"text":"I was really bummed-out one day.... Girl problems.. Went to Eva B's. The owner, an eccentric man in a baggy fisherman's sweater and mad scientist hair was standing behind the counter smoking a bidi. He looked at me pensively then asked me if I'd like an espresso and a piece of cake..I'm like, \"yeah, but no...\" So he gives me this free food and as he's handing it across the counter leans over and tells me to 'fuck the world'. I bought a crazy hat and left his store feeling much better about life here in M-T-L."}
{"text":"This kind of place is not my thing. I've just discovered that today.  When we entered, they asked my friend and me to let our bags at the front counter to avoid shoplifting. I understand that, but I hate it when people take away my bag, it's my baby ):  The first floor is for the used clothes that people give away and there's food too. There wasn't really anything special, but what do you expect from thrift shop? There was also the renown \"1$ pile\", but I didn't find anything interesting. (I was scared that there were dead bodies underneath too so I left quickly. Seriously.)  The second floor is for the vintage clothes and the Eva B creations. That's where prettier clothes appear. Good price for cute clothes. I liked the terrasse, it was the only place where there was actually enough light for my liking. The fitting room is way too small to be able to change without bumping into the wall or the mirrors.  The basement is where there are costumes for rent, but I didn't visit it. I'll go when Halloween comes up!  The employees were nice and didn't hassle you. There was one that looked a bit bored with the customers though.  They should add more light and space. That's what really bothered me."}
{"text":"A cross between the strange dream you can only half-remember after getting up in the morning and the best spot to snag a Halloween costume in a pinch; Eva B's is like stepping back into time except this time is like all the decades combined into one. The place is loaded with vintage clothes, shoes and accessories as well as interesting pieces here and there from the current. What makes Eva B's unique is that it encapsulates both cafe, shop and haven in one. In addition to clothes, there are ample gidgets and knick knacks to make your heart sing. There are small chicks under a heat lamp on the second level; a couch with a TV that perpetually plays friends and an everlasting garage sale. In fact the whole thing could be one never-ending garage sale. Who wouldn't want that?   Anyways go check it out is all I'm saying."}
{"text":"really awesome thrift shop with tons of great clothes.  they also have some cheap-ish food in the downstairs too.  however, the disorder might put a lot of people off, and they really need bigger changing rooms and more mirrors"}
{"text":"OMG LOVE this store! I stumbled upon it 2 years ago on a trip, and went back 2 more times before the trip was over! I basically got a whole new wardrobe. I love the treats you get when you go in! I cannot wait to go back again this summer! MUST STOP!"}
{"text":"Warm and welcoming café and thrift store. When we came in the woman offered us free shots of spiced cider. Decent selection of clothes at reasonable price, if a little worn and dingy. Feels like a magical kingdom behind a secret door."}
{"text":"We like thrift stores. We love junk stores. This place is a bit of both, with very funky hipster style. I found two pairs of pants and a shirt, $12, $9, & $7. Granted, not steals by my reckoning. But all good stuff, at prices I would probably pay at Goodwill. With its wacky charm stacked to the ceiling, homemade lemonade samples, and mounds of clothing all being rifled by the cool kids who were swarming the place, this was a welcome find for a traveler from far away Baltimore, a town with junk stores galore. Felt like home."}
{"text":"Très grand magasin de fripes qui n'en a pas l'air de l'extérieur, le premier étage est immense . Prix qui varient : $10 /$20 les robes , $20 chemises ... etc"}
{"text":"Really love the store! I love the vintage clothing but unfortunately there was no place like this in my hometown. Visited today and just like discovering a whole new world! Definitely worth visiting"}
{"text":"I whiled away a fantastic afternoon at Eva B this weekend. I got bogged down at first going around the ground floor in circles, unable to find anything in my size or that didn't have shoulder pads... Then I remembered there was an upstairs, and fell into thrift store heaven. Everything is orderly in a chaotic sort of way, and I loved the little notes everywhere. (\"Put the stuffing back in the boots... WE ARE WATCHING.\") Positively storming with hip college kids. I bought a soft navy blue blazer for $12, but I sorta kinda really want to go back and get one of the 80's-tastic full-body winter jumpsuits downstairs in neon pink."}
{"text":"Eva-B... C'est une histoire d'amour! J'ai toujours adoré cette boutique, ce café, cet endroit inusité où se mêlent vêtements usagés, costumes, livres, objets perdus, samosas & biscuits au chocolat. Un petit cidre de pomme infusé au thé chaï pour vous souhaiter la bienvenue? Pourquoi pas! Une affiche vraiment louche d'une grand-mère qui joue au bowling toute nue? Amenez-en! Chez Eva-B on a envie d'y retourner encore & encore. On s'y sent chez soi"}
{"text":"Imagine my shock when I heard the front cash girl tell me that they are a consignment, restaurant and coffee bar.  Check in your bags with him or her upon arrival.  Amazing selection of scarves, vintage wear and everything for the creative fashionista.  Cozy environment. A MUST for unique individuals. Check your positive attitude IN."}
{"text":"Huge selection of vintage goods, don't leave without going upstairs! Prices were fair & the coffee was better than I expected!"}
{"text":"Notes on the store: Eva B  -I think this has been a used clothing store for at  least 12 years. I remember it from past visits to Mtl. I never knew it had a name.  -It seems to have gotten crazier. Now there is a giant box of $1 clothes you can dive into. Kind of like the ball room at IKEA for adult thrift junkies.  -While shopping I was offered some raspberry iced tea in a vintage glass. It was tasty and much appreciated.  -There was an old guy with a white beard cooking something in the front window. I think corn on the cob  -In the men's section there is a pet bunny  -if you go out the back there is some sort of overgrown garden  -The prices are very reasonable and they sell both vintage and new clothes  -there is an anarchist bookstore in the same block, and a vacant lot where I saw what I thought was a squirrel, but it turned out to be a rat!"}
{"text":"Eva B is the mother of all thrift shops.  It's what thrift shops want to be when they grow up.  Amazing place.  We were there for an half hour before we realized there were four floors.  We almost missed it when we were walking by due to the artwork on the front of the building.  There's only a small sign that says 'Eva B'."}
{"text":"My number one complaint is how they treat their employees. I've never worked at Eva B, but I have met a handful of ex-employees in recent years who didn't receive their pay cheques on time (like a month late) or not at all and had to fight to get paid. Regardless of my feelings are for the quality of the shop or the shopping experience, this mistreatment is unacceptable. Boycott."}
{"text":"Really nice thrift boutique, with incredibly cheap shirts and street wear. Go there for their leather jackets and do not miss their tea."}
{"text":"They give you free food on arrival, decently priced baked goods as well and a pretty expansive election of clothing spanning every decade from 60s to now, I prefer the vintage boutique part that sometime can be rather higher in price than I like spending, they do keep a selection under $10.00, but I find the prices creeping up to unnecessary proportions of mark-up so I end up leaving empty handed more so than usual. The store people people however range from some  being friendly to this one who is cringe-worthy to the point where they probably shouldn't be working with the public, but eh I sometimes find worthwhile items."}
{"text":"Eva B, can we be besties for the resties? Your hippy dippy cool reminds me of what I want/ed to be like in circa before mister baby (when I had more time.)   As you walk in there's someone stationed by the door to greet you/answer any questions/ check bags (I was traveling with a backpack and needed to leave it as I shopped.) Immediately the music playing seemed to make googly eyes with me then I saw a disco ball and my heart wasn't guarded. Don't worry though, my heart was not broken. For less than $85 I got 2 incredible winter coats which I could hardly tell if they've been worn before or not and seen similar styles for sale in a Free People catalog upwards of $300! Also,  2 scarves, dress, and a rad shawl were on the cheap ticket.  Downstairs has a groovy cafe and porch with goods of plenty to explore. Upstairs, don't miss the enormous retro costumes and inspiring deck to hangout on."}
{"text":"Don't fall in love with anything before you pay. Out of the 8 items we had hunted for, in the least organized store on the planet (which is its charm), we could only pay for 2 items. The rest were to be priced the next day. We left our name and number and called the following day to be told \"oh the owner says those aren't for sale\" I ask 'why the small kitchen gadgets buried in their \"stuff\" section is out then?'  Their reply: We haven't gone thru that section yet. The owner doesn't want to sell it (for any price!).  Really? Have you seen your 'store'? Like I said, don't love it unless you are sure they actually want to sell it.  Is it a store? It's more like a collection of stuff/junk to look at, and a place to experience."}
{"text":"Probably THE best place to shop when you come to Montreal. Get rare special pieces here for your eclectic style! Defiantly a must go to when youre here!! Ohhh and you can trade clothes too!"}
{"text":"my new favorite store!  it's one of the hippest used/vintage/consignment stores i've ever seen.  the best part is swimming through the sea of hanging bras, or perhaps just finding cool unique but still totally affordable clothing you can't find anywhere else.  they also took my US $$ and didn't charge me tax on my adorable $5 top, they pour complimentary lemonade and iced tea to beat the heat, and the lady was pretty darn cool. my favorite store in montreal by far!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place hundreds of times, not knowing what it was.  Vintage clothing is definitely not my style, but they have free popcorn when you come in. I don't even bother with the piles of clothes and other stuff, it's a hoarder's paradise  Super cheap Cappuccino's and Latte's as well as some samosas.  There's multiple terraces in the back, completely isolated, you'll feel your'e in a village and not in the heart of downtown.  My only real reason to go back here, that and maybe a Halloween party"}
{"text":"De l'extérieur on dirait un endroit délabré, où les hobos y ont trouvé refuge. Et tu rentre...tu sens une odeur de pachuli, de café et de vieux vêtements (tu sais l'odeur qu'on retrouve chez Renaissance et au Village des valeurs...) Et tu découvre cette friperie grandiose où on y trouve beaucoup beaucoup de choses!! Des vêtements, des tableaux, de l'art, des costumes d'halloween, des livres, des accessoires, des biblios, des lampes, de la bouffe...OUI OUI ils ont un comptoir à café avec des plats du jour!   À chaque fois que j'y vais je découvre des nouveaux endroit de la friperie. En premier, je connaissais seulement le premier étage, ensuite j'ai connu le deuxième étage. Cette fois-ci j'ai découvert le sous-sol et leur méga terrasse. Bref, pour ceux qui aiment découvrir et aiment les friperies c'est l'endroit parfait. Les lattés sont 2$...pas cher pas cher. L'an dernier on pouvait louer des costumes, cette année, ils sont à vendre. Beaucoup de choix pour pas cher. Je vous conseille d'y aller avant d'aller dans ses magasins d'Halloween...Vous ne serez pas déçu.  Je mets un 3* pour la propreté des lieux...ceux qui sont allergiques aux acariens, amener vos pilules contre les allergies. Cela ne me donne pas très envie de goûter à leur plat du jour."}
{"text":"Okay, so yes, this is such a fun place to wander (literally three stories of randomness), but what IM focused on are the cookies.   Those cookies are a damn necessity. Seriously. They are by far the best cookies I've ever had in my life. I've literally begged three friends traveling to Montreal to bring them back for me. If i could, I'd travel back to the city for those alone. Don't miss them. Please. For all of our sakes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Random wild mess, breathing anti-conformism, exuding playfulness of a boutique.  Serving hot samosas and lemonade sweetened with the honey they farm on their rooftop. Cookies and self serve slushies. On 3 different terrasses.  The prices are also amazing! The stock is also so pretty!   Right now, if I had to haunt some place. I think this place would be it. I think a friendly ghost is probably the only thing missing there right now...Or is it?  I better ask the owner!"}
{"text":"The burger is fantastic! And they made me an almond milk steamer with a great head of foam. Plus: cheap clothes, fun music and all kinds of atmosphere. What a great place!"}
{"text":"A Montreal institution. My daughter and I were delighted to scour the racks for treasures, after we noshed on the incredible samosas. These were hands-down the best deal of the day. An incredibly generous pocket of fried yumminess with flavorful chutney on the side, for a dollar. Yes, a dollar.  This shop on three floors doubles as a cafe, a very funkalicious one, perfect for a snack.   Eva B was exactly what we were looking for in a vintage shopping experience after making the trek up to Mile End and their carefully curated collections (with correspondingly higher prices) at places like Jeans, Jeans, Jeans and Citizen Vintage.   Edgy and cool exterior, with a warm and friendly staff, put this place on the map and clearly keep it there. Long may it reign!"}
{"text":"They changed the layout in the last couple of years, and I find myself finding less than I used to. They did away with the swimming pool of clothes, probably because it became unsanitary and no one wanted to buy clothes out of there.   They changed the upstairs, which used to be where they had the more expensive Eva B original creations and stuff from other designers. Now they have a room with costumes and other strange things, and in the next room it's more regular clothes like downstairs. I'm not sure if they moved the original creations downstairs or not. I not clear on what the difference is between the upstairs and downstairs anymore.   The service is still friendly, and the place is still unique. I just like the layout better before."}
{"text":"Awesome Thrift shop and Cafe. They have so much stuff. You could spend a whole day and find lots of cool things. It's got this great atmosphere and the staff is really nice. You won't get tired of it. They change the displays often because so many people sell and donate their stuff there. You are guaranteed to find something you like. Otherwise, eat something. Everything is gluten free and vegan."}
{"text":"I can understand the people who don't like it because it isn't their thing but if it's your thing you'll really love this place, the cafe smells amazing, there's stuff to look at every where, and prices are really reasonable! I spent less on 7 items here than I would have on 2 up the street. I don't know if it was just my lucky day but I scored here better than I have thrifting for awhile. They have a mix of vintage, new brands, and other quirky stuff. I found the leather jacket section upstairs especially appealing... Plus their playlist was amaze Amy Winehouse and NSYNC*"}
{"text":"C'est l'endroit ou aller"}
{"text":"Now this place is even worse - before you could bring piles of old clothes and costumes and receive cash (very small amount, but still). Not anymore. It is store credit only.  Who wants to get rid of old junk only to replace it with more junk? Seriously."}
{"text":"Sensory overload and overwhelming array of stuff that made it very difficult to find anything. A huge area filled chest high with clothes all at $1. If you can find anything. Take your shoes off and wade in. Find a gem if you can. I personally doubt it.  Everything else was overpriced which is typical for a trendy store. I'll stick to thrifting thanks. Same stuff for 1/4 the price."}
{"text":"En passant par St-Laurent, vous aurez peut-être remarqué cet étrange magasin à la vitrine pour le moins surprenante : des mannequins dont le sang a éclaboussé les vitres y sont exposés, des tampons sanguinolents sur un cadre y trônent à côté de poils pubiens, des fantômes pendent dans le vent... On entre là en se demandant un peu ce que l'on va trouver... Pas sûr d'avoir les mêmes goûts que les propriétaires! Pourtant, Eva B, est une friperie tout ce qu'il y a de plus géniale! À l'intérieur, vous trouverez une foule de vêtements à bas prix voire même très bas prix. Certains sont même vintage, mais soyons honnête, ce n'est pas la vocation première de la boutique. Son principe est de refaire son stock d'articles grâce aux vêtements achetés à ses clients. Ainsi donc, vous viendrez ici autant pour acheter que pour vendre. Mais ce n'est pas un dépôt-vente, car Eva B, vous achète vos vêtements immédiatement après sélection et vous repartirez avec pièces sonnantes et trébuchantes en poche. Bon, ne comptez pas non plus repartir riche comme Crésus, parce que vu le prix de revente, vous n'allez certainement pas en retirer cher... Autre concept amusant, leur bac à fripes. Il s'agit d'un immense bac à vêtements, dans lequel on plonge littéralement après avoir enlevé ses chaussures. Tout y est à 1$. Bien évidemment, ce sera à vous de fouiller et farfouiller pour trouver votre bonheur, mais ça reste le principe général de la boutique : un joyeux fourre-tout, bordélique à souhait. On y va pour chiner, seule ou entre copines, boire un thé au comptoir ou même manger une petite pâtisserie ou un samossa, ce qui permet de reprendre des forces entre deux plongées dans cet étonnant mais réjouissant chaos!"}
{"text":"Four stars for being the epitome of thrift shopping in all the sensory experiences. The only thing I wouldn't touch is the food (although I heard it's good) simply because I'm paranoid about places covered in dust that serve samosas that lie out in the same place people flick their dirty clothes about.   Other than that though, Eva B is the place to go - just to say you went! The prices are decent for the items, I saw a lovely yellow trench coat, lined, winter-worthy and all for $40. It was really a rare yellow color - mustard and lemon mix. Bras hang from the ceiling (wouldn't buy those though), and this insane $1 pile where all you do is take off your shoes and DIG. I'm sure that if you find something there it would be worth it, just depends if you have the time to scrounge through.  It's definitely more of a feminine feel through out the place. But you can see the mind of pop culture genius working throughout the decor. When I went for Christmas, they had a naivety scene with Harry Potter as Jesus, Hitler as the fther, a Bratz doll as Mary and naked Barbies as the Three Kings. GOODNESS! Outside the store... dun dun dun Michael Jackson holding his precious baby.  The store is a general mess. I'd set aside more than half a day to look for something, and even then Value Village is probably cheaper - but the experience is half the go. I've never seen a store like it in my life."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this store since 2013. I got a few items last time but during this most recent visit, I only got a pair of sunglasses b/c they looked quirky. I actually immediately regretted it b/c i am actually not hippy and mentally prepared enough to wear old dusty sunglasses. Oh well there goes my $10. The store was really fun to spend time at in my opinion - way better than actual big shopping malls. I wish there was AC there b/c it felt like 30 degrees + inside."}
{"text":"I went in with the intention of getting lunch and maybe browsing around.I left with two giant cookies,beautiful dress,pretty top and super classy scarf for the grand total of 21.00$!.The lunch specials sounded good but I wasnt as hungry as I thought.The cookies I bought instead were quite delish.Im a Baker so I know and love yummy cookies.They were executed almost perfect(I would have baked them 2 mins more however.The huge random chips didnt really fit in so I had to really bite into the cookie to get through them.However they were very spaced apart which is fine cause that cookie without was scrumptious! So past the prom dresses and other odds and ends is the second floor where the goodies are.I almost missed it!Thats where i scored my loot.I had fun because of the heavily discounted high end clothing.I definitately will come back for the lunch.Its a open kitchen and it looked pretty yummy."}
{"text":"i am soo overwhelmed with this place... its funky you can always find classy or camp or costume... i was in Montreal for the jazz festival and went every day for cappuccino and shopping. i got a boatload  of jewelry enough to last me until next year... and clothes but the draw of the place is julie and crew and the young old man.... you are missing something if you dont stop here even if you live in town!"}
{"text":"Whoa, mama, this place is intense. You feel like you've walked into an attic of a circus hoarder's house (or something like that). All kinds of crap everywhere, very little room to move around. An absolute overkill of sights, colors, people and stuff. Not the place to go if you are afraid of dirt, crowds or cluttered spaces. Also it was extremely hot and stuffy. But it really held my attention and I found some things. I was offered lemonade when I came in but didn't drink any. There was a white haired guy who was shirtless who was selling stuf (I assume he was one of the owners). Rooms full of bizarre painting, maniquins, costumes and just junk. An unforgettable experience, to say the least."}
{"text":"I travel the world and am the queen of thrift store treasure hunting.  Previously, my favorite thrift store was the Goodwill on Baseline in Boulder, Colorado, but since my teenaged daughter and I stumbled onto Eva B, it has surpassed all the others!  While in Montreal last February (-22 F!) , we made the trek to Eva B several times in one week to enjoy lunch/tea in the very comfortable trendy atmosphere and pass 2-3 hours treasure hunting.  If you enjoy really cool thrusting, this is a Montreal must-do!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's extremely unique and has the earthiest vibes. Never bought anything at a thrift store before this one. They also have amazing free popcorn (seriously, what do they season it with?) and the BEST cookies for $1. I'd recommend going to Eva B to anyone looking to explore downtown. Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"I love thrift shopping and after coming across Eva B, I'm even more in love with the concept of thrifting. The shop is huge, with a wide range of selections for everyone. It's a place where you have to spend time to explore. In the two weeks that I've been in Montreal so far, I've came four times. Although I still think that the shop is still a bit on the pricier side, it's undeniable that they have great service and amazing food. They have free popcorn and that won me over. I've also had their samosas and the iced tea- both amazing. I will definitely be returning as a regular."}
{"text":"They offer shot glasses of hot tea when you come in, which was nice for the winter time. There are three floors, the first floor has food and clothes, the second has more clothes, and the third floor had an Etsy showing. To go to the third floor, you had to wait because they only let a few people up at a time. The clothing is great for vintage lovers and those with a quirky, eccentric, and artistic style."}
{"text":"Walking in to Eva B is like walking into a lunatic's head. That being said, it's FANTASTIC! Wacky stuff everywhere you look! I stopped in recently and noticed that they've expanded and are still mid-renovations, and I was with a friend who was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to check out all the new space. Must go back!  The first time I discovered Eva B, I couldn't even believe such a place existed. Hanging out of the upstairs window was a Michael Jackson mannequin looking about to drop a baby onto the street below. Everything you could ever want is here. Wigs, costumes, CLOTHES CLOTHES CLOTHES - vintage, gently used, rare items, jewelry, handmade stuff, antique knick knacks, leather for days, shoes, bags, weird things you never knew you could want until you see them. It's a thrifter's dream.   I didn't notice if it was still there, but the first time I went there was one room with a clothing mountain, that you had to climb up on with a ladder and you could dig and dig through the mountain and select as much as you wanted, with everything just at $1.  It's also a café, with free tasters of apple cider or whatever they have on that day (tea, lemonade, etc) and free popcorn, plus all kinds of treats to buy. I haven't tried the coffee yet.   The manner of display is to cram as much as possible into one space, but it's done so creatively and interestingly that you want to spend the time to dig through it all. Plan at least a few hours to be here. I'm pretty sure they hold music gigs here once in a while, too, with part of the space designated as a theatre-type setting.   Remember what I said about it being like walking into a lunatic's head? Well, said lunatic is often around - the owner is hilarious, snarky, and definitely a character to experience. I think he liked me, but I wasn't completely sure! Haha! This is an experience of a lifetime in Montreal. Just GO and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet thrift shop. Some items are definitely overpriced but in a central location (Boul. St Laurent) so I can understand partially. Scored a few cute items in my last visit and will definitely visit again. Their cafe looks cute and they give free samples sometimes! Can be hit or miss though!"}
{"text":"Was in the store, when I heard the owner yelling at some of the workers.  It was very aggressive, and I felt uncomfortable and was concerned for the safety of the employees.  Employees were crying from the treatment. Would not shop here again."}
{"text":"It's a shop that mainly sells vintage clothing. They reworked it lately, and arranged all sections. Noting that in the past you could find anything anywhere and couldn't move easily through aisles, and floors; it looked like an attic; it was packed with miscellaneous objects.  Each time I go there I notice that something changed, it is like a living place! It's always a new discovery! There is a coffeeshop, food, books and several small cozy corners and terraces to enjoy your moment!"}
{"text":"A very unique and fun experience! My boyfriend and I started with ordering coffee and looked around while waiting for the coffee. Then sat in their cute seating area with quaint, old fashioned tables and chairs--you can choose a comfy sofa with extra soft cushions or an antique wooden chair. We shopped after and we both found excellent clothing for ourselves and gifts for my boyfriend's daughter and her boyfriend. I found a turquoise and orange Moroccan mumu from the 1970s! Love this place! Thank you for creating the best shopping experience around!"}
{"text":"Almost passed right by this place on my way to the Old Port.  Glad I stopped in to see what's up.  At first glance, a used clothing store with free lemonade.  On second glance, also the cheapest coffee shop in town.  $1 including tax for a single espresso, prepared in a charming fashion.  Add in huge homemade cookies for $1 and we're already at 5*.  I walked to the back with my espresso and found the cutest dog lounging on the couch.  He was happy to have a friend.  Then a random girl sat down and played a bit at the piano.  Awesome vibe to chill for a bit during a busy weekend.  Came back again and asked the older gentlemen that works there, perhaps the owner, when they close.  \"Whenever... the fuck... I want!\"  Amazing.  Six stars for this place."}
{"text":"This thrift store is so unique and HUGE! there are 3 main levels with mini levels on each floor.  You can also purchase little snacks while you shop.   However, be prepared to feel overwhelmed here because the store feels never ending.   Also, it's very hard to tell if any items are on sale because they are not marked very well.   The shoes are probably the most well organized and marked by type. I really appreciated this.   As an avid thrifter, I was disappointed to see that the majority of the prices were still extremely \"expensive\" for a thrift store. However, I would say this reflected the quality of the items.   The ambiance was just slightly overwhelming. Also, many of the clothes hang on a swinging sort of clothes line. This is so unique and artsy, but it makes it difficult to have a steady hand while searching through the racks.  Tip: if you go here, bring more money than you would think to bring, and be ready to spend a lot of time here!"}
{"text":"I usually NEVER go to thrift shops, but I had heard that it was a thing in Montreal so I went to Eva B. and was not disappointed! This place is literally amazing, worth it 100%. They have delicious vegan pastries and espresso, with people eating on the patio, some couches in front of Friends, or a 70s corner!! Most of all, the clothes are so cool!!!! They also have costumes and decorative accessories and painting and basically you'll feel special there, by yourself or with friends!"}
{"text":"This is just not my kind of place. When you walk in, it's immediately sensory overload. There is stuff EVERYWHERE- hanging from the ceiling, all over the floor, and racks and racks of dusty clothes. There is a bunch of food at the front that looks good enough, but the place is so dusty, dark, and dirty feeling that despite how hungry I am, I'm never tempted. They give you free popcorn and tea samples when you walk in, which are decent enough but I just don't enjoy eating in an environment like this.   You can rent costumes downstairs but the ceiling is extremely low and it smells even worse down there. I went down there this year to browse Halloween costume ideas but very quickly had to come upstairs because I started feeling extremely claustrophobic.   I also brought a large bag of clothes here to sell once, most of which were in really good shape. The bag was probably at least 10lbs and for all those good quality clothes, they gave me $5. To be honest, I was quite offended because most of my stuff was definitely nicer than what was on the racks.  Anyway, some people really love this place- I feel like it is quite polarizing. You either hate it or you love it. It's just not my thing and I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"A fantastic thrift shop with a ton of stuff! They have several floors and with some patience you can find awesome stuff for costumes or day to day clothes. They also have some yummy vegan food and good coffee so highly recommend the place although you might end up spending more time than originally planned ;)"}
{"text":"This cute shop was everything you could dream of for a thrift store.   Upon arrival, we were given samples of their tea and smoothies. The rest of the cafe area was located right in front of the door and was just too crowded to order so we continued on.   There were so many rooms and floors absolutely jam packed with anything you could imagine. Clothes, book, jewlwey, movies, bags, costumes, shoes, etc.   There was an outdoor courtyard with multiple levels that went as high as the three story building. There was even an area inside yo lounge and watch friends.   If you are going to Montreal, this is a must-do."}
{"text":"My mom discovered this place while visiting me in Montreal! I never realized such a cool and hip place existed within the vicinity of my apartment! Super fun experience just visiting there let alone doing the actual shopping!  The vibe is super casual and fun! you'll definitely have a smile on your face as you browse around!"}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of thrift shop, something about others wearing someone's else clothes is not something I am comfortable in. The place doesn't wash the clothes but when it is obviously dirty, they will wash it. When you think about it, stores' clothes also got worn by hundred of strangers before someone buy the article...  Regardless, the place has a lot of great finds and it takes some extra effort to find the gems. I sold three bags worth of clothes and I got a 30$ back. Since I am a huge foodie, I use 1/3 of my credits on food. The food is homemade and it is very good... I got a plate of dumplings, a pumpkin mashes soup, a chai latte and a bavlava. It came down to 11.30$ with the taxes. With the credit, I had to pay the taxes difference because it doesn't cover it. When you think about it, 1.30$ for a complete set of meals is an amazing deal. Can't beat that anywhere else!   After spending about an hour there, I went up the stairs to discover a whole new world. Rooms of clothes, bags and shoes were awaiting me. I didn't expect to buy anything at all since I rarely find anything worth buying but a pearl necklace caught my eyes, then two bags! I spent 18.65$ there in 15 minutes without blinking and I was out with three new things to wear.   Good grief... It was quite an experience. I will be coming back to sell more of my clothes and possibly shop there. Maybe the thrift stores ain't so bad after all!"}
{"text":"Unlike any place I've ever been.  Pair the coolest cafe with the coolest thrift store and you get the idea. Unbelievable vibe!"}
{"text":"This place is a great vintage spot. You're greeted w/ a shot of free tasty iced tea, a cafe to the left, theres a section in the backyard where you could chill w/ your cafe goodies.  Cool staff, interior is all quirky classic vintage. There's a large section of 2nd hand, vintage clothing, costumes, books, & video cassettes. It was pretty overwhelming at first, I felt I would be swallowed alive, but give it some time, its pretty worth digging through. The vintage section was where we found bad ass 90's vintage pieces, but a little more priced than what we're used to: $20-30 for pants, but pretty swaggy pants."}
{"text":"Incredible selection and great prices. So many good finds. Also very helpful staff. One of the best thrift stores around."}
{"text":"I love it. It's got amazing thrift store retro finds and is a huge beautiful melange of style and room after room of cool stuff, 80's, 90's and beyond. It's beautiful. And all the food is vegetarian or vegan!"}
{"text":"free hot cider upon entering! ... Alright, I almost don't want to post this review because I am selfish and want to keep this place to myself. But I listened to other reviews, and I feel the need to pass on the good juju. This place is a chaotic treasure and you need to explore it.  Just go, even if you don't buy anything, you won't regret it.  If you're thifty and love the hunt, this place is nourishment for your soul. I found an authentic vintage metallica tshirt there for $25 and an embroidered bomber jacket for less than $60 that has become a staple in my wardrobe.  And when you need real food, they have that too. It's yummy. You will find clothes from all eras, for all sizes and aesthetics.    Why are you still reading this and not out the door already?  Seriously, just go.  Do it."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place in the world. You walk in and are greeted with free lemonade/ice tea and seasoned popcorn.  Firstly clothes oh my goodness they have tons of it. You have to dig through piles and racks but hidden gems are scattered all over the store. The layout of the store is incredible with hidden nooks and crannies all over stuffed with vintage goodies, wacky jewellery, and pianos. If i lived here it would probably be the only place i'd ever shop. It's reasonably priced too, with items ranging from $1 tank-tops to $40 suede jackets in perfect condition.   While browsing though fabulous vintage finds you feel something brush up against your leg, and when you look down at the worlds friendliest cat and he'll be there begging for a belly rub. While rooting through buckets of $1 jewellery you'll feel a steady breeze against your thigh and a gorgeous golden retriever with be laying under the counter wagging his tail. Can it get any better? (yes)  After spending awhile redesigning your entire wardrobe you'll feel a bit peckish and can enjoy a sizeable spicy slice of vegetarian lasagna ($5) and a mountain of a chocolate chip cookie ($1). If you're nice, the eccentric (but awesome) looking owner will throw in a free expresso that comes with brown sugar and a chocolate drop.   And lastly, my absolute favourite thing is the decor. It's like everything cool in this universe was found and tacked up somewhere in the store from severed doll hands to broken clocks. They have a massive library in the back and a closet full of vinyls.   This place is every hipsters (and teenaged girl's) wet dream."}
{"text":"Giant slice of homemade carrot cake and huge latte for $5?!  Amazing. They have a massive costume selection for rent, but they are overlooked as a great cafe!"}
{"text":"Je crois que j'avais 16 ans la première fois que j'ai mis les pieds ici avec des amies du Collège LaSalle qui cherchait des vêtements 1950's pour un devoir.      J'ai capoté sur le lieu complètement hétéroclite et moi qui était déjà habitué au ancienne friperie de l'avenue Mont-Royal (ancien Gothic yard) et bien d'autres sur Rachel, Marie-Anne et St-Lo, j'étais plus que content qu'elle me fasse découvrir cet endroit,  En 25 ans, j'ai jamais vu les murs et étagères à la même place.   J'y ai fait des trouvailles remarquable de manteaux (soviétique, papracha, chemise, t-shirt)     C'est ici qu'on venait aussi pour des props, costume de tournage, photo shoot, et costume pour partys osé ou d'halloween, etc..  Mes clients photographes de partout dans le monde, on toujours trippé que je l'ai amène ici, and so the Alternative Modèle I worked with :-)  Le proprio m'a souvent traité de \"Bitch\"  quand j'arrivait à la caisse avec un T-Shirt ou chemise qu'il pensait qu'on trouverait pas  ahahah  Les Espressos, servis depuis 6 ans sont délicieux et depuis, ils ont ajouter à leur menu d'excellent sandwich végé ou pas et il y a toujours de bons cookies!  Dommage qu'il n'y plus de films style ciné-club, c'était une époque le fun.  Dans tout les cas, cet endroit est une institution du MTL underground and plus!   J'y amène fréquemment mes amies d'outremer et surtout mes clients en art et culture.  Au plaisir de vous y voir entre deux raques à vieux jeans des années 70's!"}
{"text":"mannequin heaven on god b they got arms torsos heads legs and hot apple cider not to mention golden happy dog on god b i got a jacket i got an umbrella i got a good moment and most of all i got parking"}
{"text":"What a unsuspecting place!  If Montreal had places like this scattered everywhere, I'd move from NY. Three floors are stuffed with vintage and unique finds. They not only sell knickknacks, clothing, art and accessories but also run a funky cafe in the main level. I love this store!"}
{"text":"This store has many cool finds to offer, and an overall great vibe.  I have visited a couple of different times and had perfectly pleasant experiences, however this last time was very disappointing.  I picked out a poster, and when I brought it downstairs a man who I presume Was the owner came up to me and told me He wasn't sure if I could buy it, and that he owned it.  This was confusing to me being that it was located amongst many other posters all of which were for sale.  He then proceeded to make me wait while he called his daughter and asked if he could sell it and then pushed the price up to 25 even though it wasn't marked.  Even more frustrating was that while I was paying for it he kept on insisting he wasn't sure and \"might take it back\".  Even after paying for it he said he wanted to maybe take it back again.  And then 3 hours later I saw him outside when I was walking and he said \"you're bending my poster!\" And detailed the situation to whomever he was talking to on the phone.  All in all a very nice store however, I believe that this man needs to more explicitly clarify what is for sale and what is the price for each item.  P.S. A woman came up to the counter while I was making my purchase and wanted to buy a number of frames, one of which was marked 5 and the others were unmarked. When she asked the price this same man told her one of them was 15 and the other was too important to him he would only sell it for a \"price that would scare her\"."}
{"text":"I enjoy sifting through thrift stores so this was a must-do. The place is decorated kitchily on the outside, so not hard to find. Once you step inside, it's a madhouse of stuff everywhere. Now, they must be decorated somewhat for Halloween, but I can't imagine it's much different from their usual look.   It's mostly women's clothes, jeans, shoes. They have a few dressing rooms with mirrors on the outside of the doors across from a mess of handbags. I found a polka dotted Le Chateau blouse, but cut way too deep to wear to work. I found a pair of awesome flared jeans for $7, but the waist was too big and I didn't like the empty backside without anything including pockets. I found a pair of tough black wedge combat boots for $15 CND, but not sure whether I could really pull off the girly dress/tough boots combo at my professional conservative workplace so I left them alone. In the back is a men's corner where my partner found 2 shirts for less than $18 CND and I ogled over the bunnies. There are lots of jewelry - mostly plastic, loud necklaces, rings. There was a bin of hats, too.   Off to the right of the store is the notorious $1 bin. It really is like a giant ball room., about 10 ft x 8 ft, except filled with clothes. With the recent bed bug scare in NYC and BOS, I was not stepping in, just in case.  I saw samosas at the counter for $1, yum!  So it's a thrift store-cafe, they buy clothes (\"You look better naked\"), accepts credit cards, sales people generally leave you be. You have to come prepared to dig. Pop an allergy med before walking in because it's dusty. And bring some hand sanitizer. If you don't like digging through thrift, this is not your store."}
{"text":"Intense, yes. Exciting, YES. The $1 pile makes me crawl in my skin, but that's just me.  I snagged a nice pleather moto jacket for $10 and had fun sifting around all of the little odd'n'ends. This place is my kind of jam."}
{"text":"This store is magical. Make sure you're feeling high-energy if you plan to shop; there's tons of clothes to sort through, the music is bumping, and it was crowded when I went (and it's pretty hot it in there if it's a hot day).  If you're feeling more low-key, hang out in *one of several* outdoor patios that are connected to the store!  There are racks of clothes and decor items to browse outside, but you can also park and relax if you like.  I really admire that the store owners have such a laissez approach to opening their business up and making it a playful shopping experience."}
{"text":"Can't stop coming back , I'm in love with this thrift shop , every time I go I buy something without a doubt even if it's just a cookie, i can't resist! The food is great and the clothes are always restocked with new things every time I come. I got an amazing adidas shoulder bag for 10$!!! I've gotten a cardigan once for 5$, a shirt originally made from Eva b for 5$ as well and totally made me look from the 80's and that's my style, a full body jumper for 7$ , wow I've never been put down by this awesome thrift shop. The bag system is so cute they give you a card when you go upstairs and then never mess up! The free popcorn is amazing , I've got nothing bad to say. Keep doing what you're doing Eva b!"}
{"text":"There is no place like Eva B, the shock value of this store is so intense. You need to see it for yourself. It is the most unique store that I have ever been to.  Independent artist/ designers also sell their apparel on the second floor.  An good tip, this is the best place to buy/rent your Halloween costume or if your going to anywhere that you want to really stand out from the crowd.  Also I found a pair of Burberry pants with the tags intact :)"}
{"text":"Forget the clothes... The vegetarian heavy food options and $2 lattes are what impressed me. It was a meal and coffee for $10. I haven't had valid like that since 1992. I'm coming back here everyday I'm in the MTL. Maybe I'll even look at the clothes - eventually."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars for 2 reasons: 1) the 3 stars another reviewer bequeathed needs to be evened out (IF you don't like shopping in Ali Baba's cave, or Junque stores in general - NO - YOU WILL NOT LIKE SHOPPING HERE)  2)  It is not shopping- it's a SPECTACLE. And, because it's an amazing thing to be greeted by a sprightly nymph ecstatically offering  you little cups of steaming cider on a frigid day (ESPECIALLY in Montreal where even good service is \"nice\" but not enthusiastic). GREAT music. That all said: No the selection is not vast. Yes, the changing rooms are Laugable. Yes, you Can find treasure. (green wool tweed 3 button jacket in perfect condition= 20$. Black \"free people\" leggings= $3)  Anecdotally, we brought the parents here and my 79 year old father in law was stoked to sit on the back couch with the dog, drink coffee & listen to Little Richard. My 74 year old mom wanted to move in. The Swimming Pool of clothes is No More. :(  However: DO NOT MISS THE BATHROOM. OR THE FREE POPCORN. OR THE CAFE. you get a cup of delightful cocoa served on a tray with \"add your own sweetness\" sugar on the side= Who Are These People? Genius.  Altogether, as good a tourist spot as the Basilica. And more charming. I will upload the photos later."}
