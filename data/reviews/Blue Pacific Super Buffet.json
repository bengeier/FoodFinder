{"text":"Won't be going back.  They have replaced all their vegetable dishes with many versions of bland seafood.  Started several things but had to leave them on my plate because they did not have any flavor.  Great service but bad food"}
{"text":"I went to blue Pacific this afternoon I just arrived right before dinner service so I paid for lunch prices at 3:30 and I was told that I would not be able to eat any of the dinner items that were being put out none of the shrimp none of the crab I would only be able to eat the lunch items I was told that I would be monitored by the server I feel that was very unfair  and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone I paid 20.85 for two people and didn't get any seafood items: ("}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place is getting mostly 3 stars, so I am gonna give it four with a good reasoning why. I found the inside ambiance clean, orderly and spacious, as well as modern and relaxing. The serving staff is friendly and always makes sure my drink is full and I have fresh napkins on my table. The food is pretty typical of the other all you can eat Asian style buffets in the area, but I do find a few more seafood items here than elsewhere. The clams with white sauce and cheese covered mussels are more than worth the price of admission. The cold oysters in the sushi bar area are also very fresh and tasty. As for the sushi, although you will not find the high end custom varieties you might in a more upscale restaurant, the selection is always fresh and diverse, and more than worth the money. As for MSG and other additives many buffets add to their fare to fill up customers quickly, I am not sure if Blue Pacific adds these ingredients or not...but I will say that my stomach is never upset nor do I get the bloated feeling I often do when eating at a restaurant that puts large amounts of these additives in their cuisine. The other perk is the price. At 8.99 for the dinner buffet, the price is 1-2 dollar cheaper than Super Star or the other buffets in the area. Both my guest(s) and I leave there full and happy each time we go, and have not had a bad experience with the food or customer service any time we have been."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight and was faced with the dilemma of what to eat. Many tables of Asian cuisine.  

Good selection of many Asian rim foods
Sushi was made by the same guy who does the stir fry grill, kinda bounces back and forth
When I did go to get some Sushi, it looked like a bomb went off there, then he cleaned up
The cold shrimp was not de-veined, and had the tell tale black poo strip on the back
Food was decent enough if you took the time to really look at what was just put out
Dessert was picked over with only a few pieces of each, they did not refill while I was there
The Ice Cream station scoop was sitting in a pool of dirty water
Dinner was $11.90 with water

This is a hit or miss place in my opinion. I will not go back. Good Luck."}
{"text":"Average all you can eat Chinese buffet. Good amount of variety, nothing that will blow you away or gross you out. Good value for the price"}
{"text":"Got there just after opening time, the buffets were not completely stocked until 30 minutes after, but who cares? There was so much variety that I had to be selective about what not to take...
The staff were friendly, the place was clean and spacious, what's not to like?
Best Asian buffet that I've found here!"}
{"text":"I had been craving some Chinese food at a cheap price we payed $32.00 for the wifey, son(3 year old)  and myself. I went for the sushi they place their sushi trays in like a wood cutting board on top of ice so the sushi doesn't really stay cold. Eh, I ate like 2 pieces and left the rest in the plate. Next to the sushi was was this umami kimchi! Loved it! Any ways I continued my dinner went for other food and well it was ok but now IM SITTING HERE IN MY TOILET WITH A STOMACH ACHE!! Sorry that escalated pretty quick. Won't be returning. On to the next."}
{"text":"I was really surprised! From the outer appearance I prejudged this restaurant. It is in an older building.
When I walked through the doors I was pleasantly surprised! Sushi bar rows of buffet options very clean and organizedI don't think I saw one staff member that didn't have a smile on their face this was very refreshing. I have now since referred friends and family members to this restaurant and I will continue visiting this on a weekly basis"}
{"text":"Bad Quality,  Expensive and there are So Many better buffets out there for your Hard Earned money."}
{"text":"I really like this place great value I always try to eat here whenever in Phoenix 5 stars for me"}
{"text":"for it being my first time here, it was enjoyable. it was super good. all the food i ate was delicious! my family and i enjoyed it, only issue was some food tasted as if it had been sitting there for awhile."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. Do not waste your money here. Sushi is dry and disgusting.. seafood looks questionable. Pork buns are good.. and oysters were good. Service nice. I feel sorry for the beautiful koi fish in the front. Not taken care of and swimming in dirty pond water."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim w/ my companion last sat 2 try it out. Last time I'd been here was w/ an associ8 back when it used 2 b China Star. Seemed pretty much the same setup/layout except w/ a sushi bar & more of a dessert selection. They also had tapioca but I didn't partake of any due 2 the color looking a bit 'off'. Coulda been the lighting but chose not 2 risk it.

   The interior is pretty decent 4 what it is, better than other buffet places & w/o the stinky carpet! I Remember when this used 2 b a Red Lobster back in the day b4 China *. At the entrance they have a nice li'l area where u can c all the beautiful Koi fish swimming around. A child or (kid~@~heart's) delight ~ a li'l boy was having a ball, screeching w/ excitement.

   We chose a booth in the corner, which was our mistake as we were ignored 4 most of our time there (or Maybe unseen if giving more benefit of the doubt, even tho the demeanor of the so~called server(s) w/ the exception of 1(whom we ensured got our tip) makes the 1st st8ment more likely. We kept getting scratched up because both our booth seats were ripped & the attempted tape on the 1 side kept sticking more 2 his skin than covering what was intended. Perhaps they got that way as a result of 2 many who gorged themselves there. Hee~hee

   Anyhoo, the place has about 100 or more selections of entrees, soups, all fave appetizers 2 pick & choose from, most of them being seafood items of course, hence it's name but there's also veggies, fruit, noodles, salads, toppings, ice creams, cakes & all vari8ions of meats 4 the carnivores . The sushi bar is off seper8ly as expected 4 cold items & has a picture board 2 help identify the different kinds & their contents. This turned out 2 b my favor8 4 the california rolls (iniri was pretty good 2)!  I might have missed it or perhaps was a little overwhelmed by all the choices but was disappointed I couldn't find the wasabi which I'd usually blend w/ a little water/soy sauce 2 lessen it's kick. Even w/o sauce they were really good, just would have enjoyed it even more w/ it.

   The only thing I'd do differently (other than sitting @ a different booth) is 2 get there when they open 2 enjoy everything @ their freshest, but really can't complain as it's equivalent 2 a Golden Corral w/ more of an oriental flair & a vast array of seafood dishes @ a decent price! And of course we'll look 4 the pretty latino gal ~ the only Nice/real 'server' we encountered, who saw we were w8ing 4 refills & immedi8ly tended 2 that as she just came in 4 her shift. Will get her name on a future visit & this place is defin8ly a nice option 2 have in the area... we left stuffed! So if u like 2 experiment, sampling several different things 4 ur palate, this might b the perfect place 4 u 2 do so..."}
{"text":"Drove by here a million times and it had decent reviews so we decided to try it out this weekend.

It was okay. Like half of what i tried was pretty good...the other half not much. This is a buffet so my expectations were low. Good thing is, there was a lot of selection and once i figured out what i liked i rolled with it..

Turns out the sushi was pretty damn good...and not on the first round because i just grabbed the few pieces that were out, and they tasted clearly as if they had been out a while....So there i sat..watching...waiting...hoping...and yes finally- Sushi man came and put out a few freshly cut rolls. I got up and hoarded like half of it....Redemption for this place. (Redemption saved them from 1 or 2 stars)

So if sushi is your thing, here's my tip: Get a table where you can keep an eye on the sushi counter, and patiently wait for new rolls to come out...be selfish and don't worry about the rest of the patrons."}
{"text":"Please see my review written months ago, its still pretty much the same. I find it funny they kept my pictures up but my detailed critique is 'filtered'. Their new sushi guy is great. If you want the good sushi you have to go for dinner, or all day Sunday.

I'm not sure why my in depth review which I'd posted in 2013 was removed; it had many positives, as well as a few critical observations in the critique. I also notice another review for a different restaurant which was negative was also taken down.

Blue Pacific was fantastic when they reopened in 2013. Their Sushi was fresh & served at all times. In the last 2 years some disappointing changes include:
Actual SUSHI (as opposed to california rolls & cooked salmon rolls & cucumber/veggie rolls) are ONLY served for dinner or weekends. 
They include crab legs on Friday dinner & weekend dinners only, & sometimes there is a long wait between refilling that tray; get there as quick as they bring those legs out or they're gone & you have another long wait.
The shrimp in their shrimp dishes are little flavorless ones now, & although the butterfly fried shrimp are larger, they are still a lot of very crunchy fried breading. If you want to taste your shrimp, get some of these & take off 1/2 the breading. Or all of it.
Their soups are still good, especially the won ton, & sometimes they still have out fresh green onion & dried seaweed to top it, sometimes not? They still have cute 'desert sweet buns' & their cha-su-bao (barbeque pork buns) are okay, if not real meaty.
Their mongolian or korean barbq chicken is still great, but not always available.
Among their many asian rim items, they also have american cuisine, including pizza for the kids (really plain so only for the kids) & fried chicken & main entrees, suchas broiled salmon, sometimes roast - but when they run out it's a while before they refill.
The stir fry grill is fine, but if you want to make it special I recommend mixing it up with some of the already cooked items. 
Fresh fruit at the desert bar is sometimes excellent, sometimes not, maybe due to seasonal supply?

In summation, still an okay deal for dinner/weekends, but if you want the quality (sushi) the lunch isn't a great savings. Cos you won't get any real sushi. And even when 'dinner' time, it takes a while for them to get to the tuna! In fact, if you're in a hurry, not the place unless you're filling up a container to go, because you may have to wait for the good stuff. On a good night, can be really good. On good days, can be great, usually just okay. I've been coming here off & on for several years, most off lately as the last two times I was so disappointed with the \"sushi\" wait  (if you love salmon you're good to go, but if you want yellowtail or TUna, like me, it can be frustrating)"}
{"text":"After an hour of looking online at reviews of buffets in the area and trying to find a good Asian one that my boyfriend and I would enjoy, we finally decided on Blue Pacific Super Buffet. The mouth-watering pictures posted in other online reviews and the amazing price, only 11 dollars for a Sunday afternoon, helped us to decide. This place was 25 minutes away from us but we decided it was worth a go and we do not regret it! EVERY SINGLE dish I tried had me let out a surprised 'wow!'. There is SO MUCH to chose from! I was able to pack down a total of 4 plates plus desert. The staff was so friendly and pleasant! Our water was always full and our waitress was excellent with answering any questions I had, I asked if I was suppose to get a new plate or reuse the one I had, in response she took my dirty plate from me and with a contagious smile, encouraged me to grab a new one. She had our table always cleaned up and was so attentive to everyone in her section. On another great side, all of the food was cooked to perfection, I didn't feel sketched out by any of it, and the sushi was delicious. The crab was so impressive, the shell was crispy so I knew it was safe. Hours later, neither do my boyfriend nor I feel poisoned! 10/10, will recommend and go back! The only thing that concerned me was the pond in the very beginning, those turtles don't have a light to bask in ): maybe get them one? And more land for them to rest on? That's all, definitely give this lovely Buffet a taste!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed and ive been to many chinese buffets.    The selection was not that large.    The lomein was very blah.     Deserts were awful.    Canned fruit and little cakes that tasted as if that sat for 3 days.   I love chinese food but this really wasnt that good.   My son enjoyed it but this is the 1st chinese place I didnt care for"}
{"text":"Okay service, pricey food. My son and I drive by Blue Pacific every school day. I have always wanted to try it since we love sushi and seafood. $12 for an adult dinner buffet.

Sushi bar:
Stars of the bar:
Well seasoned seaweed salad
Well marinated chili mussels
Nice octopus salad

Not so nice:
Okay California rolls.
Tamago or egg omelette roll was on the dry side.
Inari or sweet tofu sushi was good except the panko bread crumb sprinkles were soggy.

Cooked food
Stars:
Garlic seasoned fried chicken wings. They were crunchy and tasty
Pork on a skewer were tasty with soy marinade and flavorful. Great texture
Fried beehoon was decent
Okay gyozas
Well sauteed littleneck clams albeit a little sandy
Okay fried blue crab
Not bad marinated sauteed mushrooms
Okay General Tso's chicken
Nice bean sprouts on the BBQ Grill
The beef slices were okay.

Not so tasty:
Freezer burned char siu or barbecue pork steamed buns.
Soggy and salty steamed wontons
Flavorless charsiu 
Burnt grilled pork
Spicy but underseasoned Korean Chicken
Kimchi was not well seasoned
Lo mein was meh
Some of the chicken in the BBQ was off...sour tasting.
Teriyaki sauce in the BBQ grill was thin.

Sweets:
I enjoyed my bite of coconut cookie.
The cut melon was lovely.
I liked the fried bananas. They were sweet and tangy.

We had high hopes, but we don't think the good outweighs the not so good for the price. Also, I just can't face freezer burned dumplings and chicken gone off being served on the line."}
{"text":"My family and I went to go get ice cream and a lady that was sitting next to the dessert station said a kid had been spitting in the ice cream buckets. That same lady complained to the employee who in return did nothing about it so my sister in-law told another employee.The employee just smiled and walked away.No one did anything! Truly disgusted and will never return again!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Rand H. shortly after this super buffet opened in the building that used to be China Star. The signs outside emphasized seafood and so it was a bit disappointing to find out that though there were indeed several seafood items offered, the number and variety of seafood dishes were not any more than would be found in a regular super buffet. The food was mostly good, though I could not say that it is any better than what was offered in China Star, the previous incarnation of this place. I was also anticipating a good variety of sushi but again, the sushi items were no greater in variety than in a regular buffet, and most of them had cream cheese in it - sacrilege for those who like properly made sushi. In all, it was an OK dining experience. Not great, but good enough to consider repeat visits."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. Do not recommend! Cashier just charged us for drinks, even if we just wanted water. Didn't bother to ask. Cashier/host kept my friends change, he had to go ask for it."}
{"text":"I don't know why the other reviewers were so unhappy.  It could be that some of the bumps have been smoothed out by now.  The sushi bar had a lot of variety and it was good - but yeah Sushi 101 - it is, however, a buffet - so I was happy with what they had.  The dim sum choices were adequate.  The boneless b-b-q ribs were amazing and the coconut shrimp was good.  Hot/Sour soup was the only really disappointing thing I served myself.  There were plenty of seafood choices including oysters, but I didn't try those - I am goosey about oysters in buffets - any buffets.  Endless beverage - senior discount.  The desserts were nothing to write home about.  I like the ice cream idea, but there were tons of little kids trying to scoop their own ice cream - and I imagined all those little germs scattering themselves all over the ice cream.  I ate some anyway - I understand why places like these go to soft-serve and I am hoping that Blue Pacific doesn't.  I only tried about 8 of the 120 some-odd choices - they even had roast beef and french fries!  Oh - the rice - yeah - that was a downer.  Cheap, nasty rice, which was  a shame because the dishes I tried were really, really good - once I tasted the rice (a bit tough and not at all fragrant) I didn't put any under my food.  I will go back.  There were many dishes I wanted to try but I was so stuffed it was impossible to do so.  With our senior discount (10%), we paid 22 bucks and change for dinner and endless soda.  Better than Olive Garden with its supposedly endless breadsticks (which are, if you can find a server to bring you more) and all the salad you can eat (same problem as above)."}
{"text":"Refused service due to restaraunt stubbornness.


I own a galaxy s8. Havent carried my debit card in months as ive just been using tap to pay for everything and it works litterally everywhere on any magnetic card swiper. Even if it isnt set up for tap to pay.

Im used to some places telling me it isnt going to work only for it to ACTUALLY work and the people working there gaining a bit of knowlege and me getting points.

But never has a place gotten angry at me and flat out refused to even ATTEMPT to take my payment. Which, to me makes absolutely no sense because this is a place where you pay BEFORE you eat. The worst thing that would happen would be that this is the first place in the world ive ever been to that i cant pay and i simply go home. But really? You didnt even want to try?

Some people just dont want money i guess."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet because it's close by.  Food was good but just the ordinary chinese buffet. Not bad but just not something to bring you back.  All the dishes seemed to be labeled which is a good thing.  Something new was corn and shrimp which were quite good.  All the dishes involving chicken were chewy.There were several types of sushi and all were good but I'm not a shushi expert so I can only say I liked them.
Building is older and dated.  They had a TV tuned to Nick cartoon show and although there were several children there, none of them showed any interest in it leading me to wonder why the tv was even turned on.  
probably won't come back but only because there are more impressive buffets in the area.  Once again, nothing was bad.  Nothing was eye brow raising either.
They had a sandwich board displaying what was on their sunday buffet and that was interesting."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed by the cleanliness of this restaurant.  We went at 5:00 pm on a Thursday and the food was fresher than many of the Chinese buffets we have been to.  A huge variety of tastes and colors and fairly priced.  I got much more than I expected."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for years and since our favorite chinese buffet had closed down on 43rd Ave & Peoria we have been looking for a great chinese buffet every since.

Well today I was craving chinese and I wanted it buffet style so I decided to check this place out. I didn't know what to expect but I will say after parking and walking to the entrance it smelled delicious!!!

We were greeted right away by two nice ladies and I asked to see the buffet before paying and they obliged. I walked to the buffet and was like holy moly look at all this food and variety. I was eager to go pay and start digging in.

$10.99 for Adult Sunday Dinner plus $1.79 for a beverage. I am not one to pay separately for a beverage at a buffet because I feel it should be included in the price but to get the first full time experience I went ahead and ordered the drink.

I was excited to learn that they serve Pepsi products!!! 

The drinks come in a generous sized plastic cup and on this day the Pepsi was fresh and delicious.

There was so much food to choose from such as sushi, salmon and other seafood items. Meats such as boneless ribs and other meats that could be grilled mixed with vegetables from the grill.

Fried rice, noodles, orange chicken and beef and broccoli plus other standard buffet items. They had a small salad bar but I didn't partake. They had a little fruit section but I didn't partake and they did have a small dessert area and ice cream by the scoop.

PROS:

$10.99 Adult Price & $1.79 w/free refills very reasonable. Lunch is $7.99 but I am not sure if all the seafood is out that might be just a dinner option.

$3.99 per pound for take out and $4.99 per pound if you mix seafood to go as well.

Clean restaurant and friendly employees.

All workers were chinese which is unique because most chinese buffets in Phoenix don't have very many if at all chinese workers. Not a big deal just different.

Refills were on point and didn't have to wait too long.

All food was fresh and replenished efficiently as it was very busy.

CONS:

I did not like the fact the ice cream was self serve meaning you had to scoop it yourself because it is not very sanitary especially with small children sticking their arms and hands full of germs in the ice cream containers to scoop. I would have preferred a soft serve ice cream machine.

FUNNY MOMENTS:

Seeing other patrons stacking their plates high full of food as if the buffet was not going to be there when they finished their plate. It was amusing because there was plenty of food and it was rapidly being replenished so there definitely was not a food shortage LOL but to each their own.

Don't get offended I am a big man and I can eat with the best of them I just don't need to stack my plate like the food is not going to be there when I want more.

Anyways....

This buffet has so much food and a variety to choose from that literally you can not experience all of it in one visit. Its amazing.

SUMMARY:

Great fresh food at a very reasonable price and we will definitely be back to visit. This is our new chinese buffet place!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here today for dinner when a friend mentioned having a coupon. The place was really clean and had a nice atmosphere to it. They had a big selection with a nice amount of food on the buffet - enough so that you'll get some of a dish, but small enough that it won't get all cold and gross. I had the usual fare - orange chicken, bbq pork, general tso, some teriyaki chicken thing, crap puffs, rice noodles....hm...they also have potstickers and various eggrolls and sides, hell yea. There was this weird squishy dumpling thing with black bean paste? I could eat a thousand.

The guy did charge me for two sodas when one of us had a water. Not a big deal but I didn't realize til after so I coerced my friend into taking it instead of water/being healthy, because I am an evil fatty and have no shame. :D 

What stood out to me were those steamed bbqpork dumpling...things. Holy shit, I've never had one before, I cried tears of joy. they were fresh and honestly I'll be going back to have some more, especially if they have them at the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Come at lunch for a cheaper price. They have everything out at lunch. It's delicious. Worth spending $20 for two (drank water) don't think about coming here...come here. They have cheap take out too. A Buffett with a cheap take out? Can't beat it, seriously best in town!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet I've had in a long time very comparable to Boston and New York. Absolutely delicious you will not leave hungry you'll definitely want to go back again and again..... Prices are great$"}
{"text":"My son LOVES this place! It has a great assortment of seafood including crab, shrimp, and sushi. Many of the items you can find at any regular buffet, but the stuffed crab shells are my favorite. Grab a coupon from their website or in the mailers."}
{"text":"Much variety to choose from.  Service is always with a smile.  At times  the buffet is allowed to run low, which tends to lead to dried out food.  Must watch cashier, as she will include drink cost without asking what you will be drinking, even when you only want water to drink."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one touched the ginger or fresh garlic. Tea please, we'll be here for a while. Ice cream land is confusing though, do you stick your arm in do you not stick your arm in. How do you retrieve the goods safely!? lol
Staff was great. Place was clean. Would go back."}
{"text":"Blue Pacific es uno de los mejores restaurantes que e visitado si no es que el mejor, me encanta la comida y el sushi no se diga es el mejor hablando de restaurantes chinos realmente es para mi el mejor su ubicación es buena y el estacionamiento también está bien siempre hay espacios, tengo casi 12 años visitando este lugar y aunque cambio de nombre y diseño por dentro siguen preocupándose por dar una buena calidad en sus alimentos y servicios, los dueños son amables parecieran muy serios pero con el pasar de los años reconocen a sus clientes fieles y se toman el tiempo de saludar, pero la verdad es que aunque no fueran así no me importaría porque como dije anteriormente la comida es deliciosa las mesas la decoración y pisos no son de lo mejor pero igual es limpio además los precios son accesibles, los viernes es día con muchos mariscos como Ostiones y patas de cangrejo, lo único es que con los Ostiones no están al pendiente de que estén surtidos puede pasar buen rato sin que saquen en fin igualmente es uno de mis favoritos!"}
{"text":"So i finally got to try this place as many times as I've driven by iy n live down the street from it. The food wasn't to bad they had a cool selection n it did taste good. Sushi was good also, at first walking in u have to pay b4 sitting then they bring u ur requested drinks n the service was just eeehhhh my water could of been filled more. They also have a mongolion grill u can create ur own noodle dish n they whip it up for you while u wait. Its a small venue, n i found out that friday,sat,sun they serve crab legs in which most buffets in AZ only do crab legs on sundays which sux...so that is a plus. Would i come back? I might it really wasn't that bad, it certainly would not be my first choice of buffets though. I do have to check out the weekend crab legs n I'll do another updated review for that day..."}
{"text":"Food is not very good. Even the sushi is not great. Some of the grocery stores make better Sushi. I don't get my money's worth because there isn't much that is very good."}
{"text":"I wouldnt exactly call this a seafood buffet. I use to frequent this buffet before the change over and found the food exactly the same. However the seating layout seemed better"}
{"text":"Blue Pacific Super Buffet is located on a convenient corner (Dunlap and 35th Ave) on the westside.  Inside has an easy access layout with about 5-6 islands of food.  Good-sized no doubt, but the servings are just okay.  I would only recommend you eat there if you're on your way home and don't want to bother cooking.

They earn a fair grade for their use of labeling.  Half of the dishes had no names and for my palette, not too many trays looked appetizing.  Many were lukewarm, the fries were cold, veggies were overly greasy, most fruit was from cans, desserts tasted like the cheap brands.  

The kimchi was good.  Egg rolls were good (no meat).

The only meat I tried was the salmon.  I waited until they brought out a fresh salmon fillet.  First bite, not the best; it had a strange texture.  Second bite - is this really salmon?  Third bite...uh uh uh...spit it out and didn't take another.  The color and taste were off.   

Unfortunately, that's the sour bite that ended my lunch and I walked away forgetting to leave a tip for the bus boy/girl.  Woops, sorry Blue Pacific."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here tonight and I was really impressed! When you first walk in there is a koi pond at the front. It was $16, but they had everything and it was a Friday night. 
Sushi and oysters on the half shell were very good, and fresh. I especially liked the tuna and the salmon roll...yum! I also had egg drop soup, crab legs, broccoli beef, garlic shrimp w/jalapeños, bbq pork rib, steamed pork bun, fried butterfly shrimp,  egg roll and crab puff. I was stuffed, but they had hand scoop ice cream, (5 flavors to choose from and dessert cakes/pastry.

I am super picky and this buffet impressed me!  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The sushi was less than thrilling.

The mongolian grill was decent.

The wontons fell apart.

The selection was fairly extensive, but the food appeared to have been out for a bit.

I would not return of my own choosing."}
{"text":"We ate there about 7pm on Monday night and really liked the experience.  The food was good.  There was plenty of tasty items to choose from.  The \"crablegs\" were unique the way they were cooked and served .  They tasted as if they had been deep fried which was yummy for me.  Also it seemed as if they cut the crab in half with legs attached which I thought was more meat.  The actual legs were pretty scrawny but I was pleased none the less.  I liked all that we had to eat.  We will return.  Plenty of fruit and really good ice cream.  The wait staff we had was kinda slow and if I didn't ask for more sprite I didn't get any more but all was good.  We enjoyed."}
{"text":"Went to this location a few weeks ago with some friends. I believe it was on a Friday and they had crab legs available. There were so many options to choose from (sushi, crab puffs, sea food, many meats, desserts, fruits, veggies, etc.) and the food was fresh. I thought the prices were very affordable also. Not much else to say other than I love the food and will return in the future."}
{"text":"ok-
So it has been open for several months and tried it finally for Fathers day

So
I will say I have never seen so many choices on a Buffet and Made Golden Corral look like leftovers after a Walmart grocery yard sale

I will keep it brief
Asian Cuisine was awesome
Teriyaki Chicken
Orange Chickien
Pot stickers were a little lacking
Seafood Shrimp for the most part were not bad
Head on,... a little sketchy
Mussels on the Half shell....AWESOME

Crab of all sorts lacking and strange crab legs looked like they have been steamed for 2 days, were 1/10 the size... Like not worth even cracking, no taste.

My son I have never seen a 16 year old concentrating so hard, I looked over at him and he \"Actually Drooled\" and never knew it.

OVER ALL FATHERS DAY WAS A CRAZY DAY It was a great time people watching and trying interesting looking foods."}
{"text":"Very good.  Clean restaurant.  Tasty muscles, clams, oysters, crab, and shrimp.  great and oh that strawberry ice cream!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here. The food is usually very good. The price of buffet is reasonable to cheap. The selection is great and there is something for everyone. The the sushi bar is the only thing lacking which is my favorite spot in this place. I love sushi but wish there was more to choose from such as octopus, eel, squid, ECT. Otherwise it's Pretty decent. The staff is pretty friendly and fast. My son loves to come here too... Mainly because of the coy fish pond. I'm only giving four stars because I would love to see the sushi bar expand a little more. If that happens I'll gladly give this place five stars. I do like this restaurant and will certainly come back. 

I do recommend this restaurant if your looking for a cheap and good meal."}
{"text":"Eh. Decided to come up here during my lunch break. You pay when u enter. $8.22 after tax with water to drink. Decided to sit by the ice cream bar. It was really warm in there. Overall the food was very hit or miss. I never waste food but I had a lot of leftovers. The buns were so chewy it was blah. The sushi tho huge was blah. They had some unidentified or labeled food. There was I think smoked mackerel.... basically the fish minus the head skin bone and all. The pineapple cake was excellent and the salmon was as well. Didn't try the grill like I usually do. Other than that wasn't overly impressed. May be back but most likely go to the one at metro center."}
{"text":"Service was good, I liked the way they had a lady coming around to keep you filled up without asking.
 Food was just ok, I guess.  I am a fan of mussels with masago, but this place just used a spicy mayo on the top.  That kind of sums it up - basic flavors - nothing great or top notch.
  The whole time we were there some of the items had not been replaced so there was not a full line up to try and this was a Saturday for lunch!  I found that really strange.
  We didn't eat very much or get to try some items.
Probably will not go back as there are a bunch more to try here in town."}
