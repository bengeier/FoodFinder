{"text":"This place is okay. The fried rice is outstanding but everything else is just okay. There is a lack of Chinese food in meadowvale so this place does satisfy my craving.... Simply due to the lack of choices."}
{"text":"My kids love the sweet and sour stir fry chicken - we eat it almost every week, and it always tastes good - fresh crispy vegetables and good amount of chicken. The other menu items are hit and miss, but we have not tried everything yet. Lost a star because sometimes all the order is not in the bag (ie missing rice) but they don't offer to make it up next time. Overall - good price, good food, definitely recommend, just check the order. Not a place you want to eat in, though, only takeout."}
{"text":"One of my closest friends lives about a ten minute drive from this little strip mall take out joint. They do have a smattering of tables and chairs that will seat about sixteen to twenty but it's a rare sight to see people eating in.  When we were younger and would have marathon video game and movie watching sessions we would order from a local Chinese place and get copious amounts of overly greasy, fried everything with a side of fat. Because of this we nicknamed the old joint, \"Dirty Chinese\" for the lack of fresh vegetables and the grease soaked bag it would arrive in.  Wok This Way has taken over the mantle of Dirty Chinese. Their spring rolls are usually swimming in grease as are most of the other items on the menu. I've had just about everything at this point and they all really taste the same. Why do I keep eating there you might ask? Well it's one part cravings for food that you know is bad for you and two parts nostalgia. The food always tastes better in your memory than in your mouth."}
{"text":"I came here once when I was craving Chinese, and wanted to try a new spot. I called ahead and placed an order for beef chow mein and it was ready to pick up within 10-15 mins.  When I got home to eat this, I was so dissapointed - I don't know if it was the sauce they used to cook it in, but it didn't taste right. I ended up trying to \"fix\" it on the stove to make it taste better. I ended up throwing the whole thing out. It was bland and watery and nothing I did would make it taste better. Either way, I shouldn't have to come home and try and put my takeout on the stove."}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive and always friendly staff! They get fairly busy on holidays but still deliver quickly compared to many others."}
{"text":"Love it here   Have probably gone over 20 times  Lunch special is so cheap with soooo much food !!   for 4.99 you can get a lunch combo (there is 6 options) with a drink, rice and noodles / your choice of main and a spring roll  everything is always good & the staff is so friendly !!"}
{"text":"If you're craving delicious Chinese food at a reasonable price, this is your new favourite place. The wings and the crispy shrimp are crispy and not greasy. The chicken soo gai is another favourite. The rice is nice and fluffy, and the noodles are very well made. Not greasy at all, just right.   They deliver, or you can pick up. Great find in Meadowvale!"}
{"text":"Our Chinese food place of choice.  Great friendly staff, food is always fast, tasty and just what we ordered."}
