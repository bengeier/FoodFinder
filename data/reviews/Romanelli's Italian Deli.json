{"text":"This place's Pastrami is as amazing as anything in NYC.  The canoli was also loved my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I would have to compare this place to Lucca's Deli in Castro Valley, CA.

The sandwiches are great here.  Once you step out of your car in the parking lot, you can smell the great food coming from their doors.  
They are really quick to make your sandwich and take your order.  I went there just before the lunch rush, so I'm not sure how quick they are when it gets really busy.

The cashier up front was really nice and recommended we try their Canolis.  I'm glad we did because it was the perfect end to a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Best Italian Deli in AZ! Every year, for as long as I can remember, around the holidays we make a stop to stock up on homemade bread, pasta, and imported Italian meats and cheeses. We live nearly 30 miles away and it is more than worth the trip. Sometimes we pick up a sub or 2 and they are without a doubt the best sandwiches around. They are an institution in the state of Arizona and I look forward to going there every year and bringing future generations to continue the family tradition!"}
{"text":"Had their italian sub. Excellent. Great quality meats and bread. Staff was very helpful at the deli. Will definitely recommend this place and come back when I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great subs lots of food. Italian stallion was great. Small ma and pa deli, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A little Italian oasis in the desert ;o)
We go straight to the pastries... looking for Canolli and Tiramisu.
Their Canolli, YES... it's sooo good...  
The Tiramisu I think it's just okay...
And then they have all kinds of cool Italian theme t-shirts, like \"FBI - Full Blooded Italian\"... which is cool...
So, make sure to get the Cannoli when you come over here, and they have the chocolate one also... we bought 10 of them the other day...ba da bim, ba da bum, then they're gone ;o)"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of picking up sandwiches here for my New Yorker husband.  LOL, we all LOVE LOVE LOVE this Deli. Wish it was opened longer hours.  The hot sandwiches are authentic as are the cold deli meats. Couldn't get enough of the pickled stuffed cherry peppers as it had been several years since we had them.  Love everything about this AWESOME place."}
{"text":"What an excellent deli! I had the Roberts special a few times now and it's delicious along with the macaroni salad. Thanks Robert for the delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"Large selection, I didn't really know what most of the sandwiches were, maybe a description would help and not hold up the line. Prices were a bit high, well they were high. I was charged a mysterious $2 extra. I also think they have an extra charge for debit or I paid $2 in taxes for $9 in baked goodies. It was a great authentic place, but just too many mystery charges. Might not go back as often as I would like, $9 for just a sub is out of my range. That New York cheesecake was delish!!! The hormel ham was just too over priced, I have a small market myself, and $6.99 is just pushing it."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I have eaten here several times since we relocated here. Service is always first rate. Food is delicious. The sub's are generously layered in prime tasting meats with fresh greens and tomatoes. Bread holds up to the build while transporting it home to be consumed in front of the game. Living back east and in Italy, this place lives up to the 5 star rating. Thanks"}
{"text":"The subs are so delicious. The employees are very nice as well, great customer service."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and decided to try it. Such good sandwiches!! Best I've probably ever had. We've been there a couple times now. The people are friendly and the food is delicious!! It's fun watching them slice the cheese and meat right there in front of you!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all of the hype is about... I would much rather drive to Del Falcos in Tempe/South Scottsdale.  The sauce was rather sweet and the sides were overpriced (over $5 for a small side).  Overall, it's alright."}
{"text":"This place is freakin awesome. The sandwiches were so delicious and the cannoli's did it for me. They were the best cannoli's I've ever had. MY wife and I will be going here for as long as we live in AZ.  On top of that, the people who worked there were extremely friendly. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great deli and grocery.  They have easily the best maranara I have ever had on a sandwich or from a jar. The Romanelli's house maranara jars are $6, which ain't cheap, but once you've had it, you are ruined. The junk at the supermarket will never be good enough again.  No joke.  The sandwiches are great for eating in. The Italian bread is wonderful from the counter by the register to take home (especially with the maranara).  Really love this place."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I use yelp to find most meals while I travel for work. We found this place for lunch while looking for subs. We go so much more. I had the Italian stallion sub and artichoke salad, my buddy had the homemade sausage with peppers and we spilt some prosciutto stuffed peppers. Everything was incredible, fresh and authentic. Check them out. I would love to give a review on the cannoli but I'm taking it to go. They look great tho."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful family atmosphere! Sandwiches and desserts were great but the hospitality alone was worth the visit!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  I like to support local businesses when I travel and gladly drove the extra mile to find this local gem.  Was greeted immediately and escorted to the deli counter and given a terrific suggestion for a lunch sandwich.  I had the fresh mozzarella and prosciutto on a fresh baked Italian roll.  Probably the very best sandwich of my life!  On the way out I chose a $15 platter of Italian cookies to share with my colleagues and a cannoli (that one is all mine!).  Outstanding food and service all the way around."}
{"text":"Very great sandwiches esp. Since I'm Italian I'm picky on my meats but I love this deli"}
{"text":"We love the meatball sub, lasagna and Italian sausages. They are so helpful and have a perfect selection of food and desserts. Customer service is the best I have ever seen."}
{"text":"After driving by a million times and trying to come when it was closed, we finally made it in and I must say this place absolutely blew us away, everything was done right and done well!  We had the MEATBALL and the \"ROBERT,\" with a side of anti pasta (chunks of salami, cheese, veggies, olives, and artichokes and it was delicious, and the meatballs were juicy and full of flavor).  

Afterwords a chocolate CANNOLI which I have to honestly say was the BEST CANNOLI EVER!  

This is also a one stop for imported Italian goods (sauces, pastas, clam sauce, pesto, wines, sodas, etc), awesome deli meats, and cheeses, butter cookies, pastries...and well you get it.  We also managed to take a slice of LEMONCELLO MOUSSE CAKE and OOOOOOOO M G! 

Last but not least Robert and the staff were very friendly and provided great service!"}
{"text":"Solid Italian deli / grocer. Chicken parm was the sandwich of choice. While it's a grocery store, it's a little strange they don't have cash register by the deli section where you buy your sandwich."}
{"text":"Romanelli's makes a good sandwich, I admit. But other than that, I don't see many redeeming qualities.

The two stars is for the fact that they appear to pass off fake Parmigiano-Reggiano as the real thing (check the rinds -- if there isn't an imprint, it's not legit). And at around $18/pound, that's a shady thing to do. They also sell Garofalo pasta for $5/pound, which you can buy at Costco for $12 -- and for that price you get 8 pounds. Also: skip the cannoli. They taste like they just added a little vanilla to a can of Betty Crocker frosting for the filling.

But they do have several good olive oils that aren't absurdly marked up, as well as my favorite, La Valle San Marzano canned tomatoes which are only a buck or two more than you can find elsewhere. They also sell Maestri Pastai (a very good pasta), but at AJ's prices (although to be fair, Romanelli's and AJ's are the only two stores in the city who sell the brand).

So, go in for a sandwich, but I can't recommend much else other than the aforementioned few items."}
{"text":"My husband Dave and I moved to Buckeye AZ a year ago from NY. A few months ago we were craving a good Italian Market and Deli !! We went in search of to find the BEST in the West! We found it at Romanelli's !! All I can say is YUM YUM !! The Meatball subs and the Capicola Subs are soooo good!!! The homemade rolls are the best !!! We are going to try everything on the Menu , I hear that the Pastrami is really really good, but, when  we get there  we need the Meatball and Capicola , so my husband I split one of each and take home what we can not finish. We never leave there without buying some of their homemade Italian sausage to cook with my sauce I make at home, it is the best sausage you will find , very very good! I am italian and know what is authentic and this is it!!! My husband agrees it is worth the 35 mile drive each way for us to go have some great food!! Plus the bakery has the most delicious cookies and cannoli ! Not to mention the freezer has Spumoni! We love the Market too, we can get all our imported items needed for cooking at home Pasta etc. We highly recommend Romanelli's!!  Sam the owner and  the nice woman we met at the cash register and forgot to get her name ( darn next time) and everyone that works there make you feel at home!!!.......Thank You ,Michelle and Dave"}
{"text":"OMG. This is the best Italian food I've ever had here in Phoenix. I go for their roast beef sandwich. What can I say? So delicious, So so good and their other dishes, sausage and peppers... there's no way to describe how good they are. This deli is so immaculate, they deserve all the awards for their cleanliness and superior preparation of food and pastries. I'm going tomorrow to pick up pastries for my grandson's birthday party. Do yourself a favor and visit this wonderful Italian deli"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the 90's. being an italian chick from NJ, it was a blessing when I found this establishment. I usually get the #7 sub or the sausage, pepper and onion sub. The bonus is that they have Wise potato chips and cannoli. Their cookies are tasty too.  We usually get a pound and finish half of it before we get home.  Nice selection of imported foods too."}
{"text":"I used to live in Chicago and until Romanelli's, I haven't found a good italian beef sandwich. When I took my first bite I was brought back to so many memories. I've had a few other sandwiches here and there hasn't been anything bad. Not to mention the amazing desserts. Definitely the place to go for great food from back east. Love it!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times now.  Had a craving for an italian sub the other day so roomy and I stopped in.  While trying to figure out what we wanted, the guy behind the counter started telling us about some of the hot entrees they had in addition to the sandwiches.  Italian sausage with onions and peppers, lasagna, veal parm and something else.  He gave us samples of the sausage.  OMG!  Incredible flavor.  He definitely was making our decision harder.  Chose George's special and we decided to get some fresh hot italian sausage from the meat counter along with some fresh parm to take home for dinner.  

We, like another reviewer were supposed to be coming here for a sandwich and we walked out with so much more.  I love to cook so we walked out with pasta, the fresh sausage, hunk of parm, fresh garlic bread, black and white cookie (huge and yummy), a fabulously thick and robust tomato sauce with onion and peppers.  Think the baked ziti I made with these ingredients was the best by far.  When making italian, no more grocery items, coming here instead.

If you're looking for a great italian deli/grocer, etc, you gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Mmmm, just thinking about Romanelli's cheesecake makes my mouth water! I got there by accident, but now I think it was fate. I fell instantly in love with the atmosphere and the service was really great. Food is delish, the people are awesome, I can't wait to go there again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I went there and had the Itallian Stallion and it was fantastic. I loved the family atmosphere and all the custom itallian ingredients available in the deli. It was great service and fantastic food for a good price"}
{"text":"I have lived around this place for 10 years and always drove past it without a glance. The area looks sketchy so I never gave this place a 2nd thought. It wasn't until reading reviews online that I decided I have to give this place a shot. As a foodie, I can't believe I haven't discovered this place earlier! They have imported cheeses, meats, italian desserts, san marzano tomatoes, and they make sandwiches too! The sandwiches are good, but I think the bread is too big and tough to eat- but at least it won't get soggy easily. My boyfriend specially requested a salami and turkey sandwich and they rang us at no extra cost like Subway does. Considering this is a specialty food store, the prices are comparable to a regular grocery store PLUS it's a family owned local place. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and made my decision to go to Romanelli's off of them....bad idea. 

I got the 'itallion stallion' and added turkey, which meant my sub was around $9.00 plus. There was a good amount of meat on the sandwich, but I asked for everything except onions, but somehow didnt get any oil and vinegar so my sandwich was super dry, 

The wheat bread was not very good, and too thick. 

Overall, I was not impressed and regret going. I will stick to duck and decanter and jersey mike's subs from now on."}
{"text":"Great deli!  Everything is delicious.  We had driven by this place for years; can't believe we never stopped in until now.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Im staerting to write extremely brief reviews of all the places I have been on the road.  this is my first review:
wicked awesome deli/store
great service
awesome sandwich, with great bread.  I will be back.
I'm pretty picky on my italina sandwiches, and this one worked very well.  if your looking for something authentic, go here."}
{"text":"Cannoli!!!!  No pictures because it's gone. First time ever coming. This place is legit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection. Born and raised in CT I have been desperately missing real Italian deli fare. This place hit that mark perfectly. I got the Reuben. Beautifully seasoned, thinly sliced sheets of corned beef layered with fresh coleslaw and housemade thousand island. They've got all the classics- cape cod chips, brioschi lemon soda, pizzelle, and cannoli eclairs and black and whites! Also try the pastrami and order The Robert. This place is gold, I will be back."}
{"text":"Best subs in Phoenix! The owner was super nice and welcoming. The staff was always ready to help. The pastries are the perfect end to a meal!

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good. The cookies lacked flavor. I picked a lemon cookie and could not taste any lemon at all. I went for the sandwich so I give four stars and stay away from the cookies next time."}
{"text":"Very professional and gracious staff, absolutely wonderful food. Best cannoli I've had besides Boston or NYC and by far best potato salad. The mozzarella salad was way over priced and under seasoned."}
{"text":"Stop by here to pick up some of the best garlic bread you can get! Pop it in the oven for 5 minutes at 400 degrees at home and enjoy with your homemade pasta. So good!"}
{"text":"WOW - I had Robert's special and it was delicious.  The chocolate cannoli is killer! Great staff and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Delicious meatball sub!! They fill the bread till its overflowing!! Love it here plus all the Italian groceries are a huge plus!?!"}
{"text":"This place is authentic and food is great! Definitely a great place for sandwiches and desserts."}
{"text":"Just like back home!! Polly-O. If you don't know, you're going to need to go find out!"}
{"text":"It's impossible to walk out of here without dropping $50. From the great hoagies, to the best sausage I have ever eaten, I love this place. It reminds me of home. Real chopped cherry peppers, sweets, sabrett hot dogs and onions. I love the joint."}
{"text":"First time going today and I got the new York pastrami. Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had! This is one of the best hidden gems in phoenix. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and pastries. This has become my new favorite deli !! the home made sausages are wonderful . It has an old New York feel to it, so i felt right at home."}
{"text":"Ifind it hard to belive that I have worked around the corner from this place for tthe past two year but have never come inside.... well I have gone two times this week so far! The desserts are truly amazing and so far I have had two turkey subs and e desserts. The subs both were a little dry so you have to make sure and tell them to put plenty of condiments on it, unless you like it that way. They are all so friendly there, and they have anything you can image italian including pizza dough balls and fresh pasta ready to be cooked. While in line to check out I saw that they even sell pasta making machines! If you haven't been here or are thinking of checking it..don't hesitate. Just go! You will be happy you did :)"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian meats and cheeses in the Valley of the Sun, Romanellis should be your stop.

From the outside, it looks like your basic store in a strip mall, but you walk in and you can see immediately that these people are not fooling around.  Besides the various Italian Pride type of shirts and other tchotchkes, there are aisles of various foods either made at the deli, or shipped in from elsewhere.  Do you need olive oil or pasta? They have plenty of those along with sauces and preserved veggies.

The real draw though is the deli.  Skip the Boars Head branded meats and sandwiches made with them because you can get that anywhere, you want to go for the real meats and cheeses, which are further to the left.  Since there are multiple brands of some items, do not be afraid to ask the person behind the counter which ones are the best.  Highly recommended are the pastrami, hot cappicola, and genoa salami.

Their signature sandwich seems to be the Italian Stallion, which is very very good, but there are are a wide variety of sandwiches that you can pick up.  Besides that they also offer plenty of pasta salad and antipasto to take home, and on the day I went, you could pick up sausage and peppers for your lunch.  The staff itself come from areas like NYC and New Jersey so don't be entirely surprised if they keep things short and sweet, it's nothing personal against you.  

There's also a bakery case with various desserts, go for the sfogliatelle and cannoli, they are excellent."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was back home in a New York Italian deli. It smelt incredible. There was a HUGE variety of Italian delicacies. I ended up getting a sub( the godfather), with all the fixings. It was perfect! We also purchased stuffed chicken ( stuffed with cheeses, tomatoes, peppers and prosciutto ). I felt like I was eating my grandmas stuffed chicken! DELICIOUS! 

I was thrilled to find Ferrara torrone ( Italian almond & honey nougat candy) that my Grandma used to buy all the time when I was little.

Over all the food was delicious, however the prices were a bit much. I did purchase an over price keychain ( couldn't be worth more that $1, I paid 9.99), as well as a lanyard. Our total came to  a little under $50! 

I will be returning before I move back east!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian store here in AZ!!!  It is just like the ones back home in Chicago.  Only difference is the one back in Chicago that I used to go to (I think it was Gino's in Norridge...) also made calzones, arancinis, etc in their bakery section.  ALL Italian food, fresh made pasta.  And the family there that run the place are awesome!  It's been a while since I've been there but Robert is so helpful.  And they recognize my mom!!!  (After spending a couple hunge.)  Their cannolis and Italian Cassata cake is amazing, as are the rest!!!

If they would make homemade arancinis and fresh calzones they would get 6 stars from me!!!  The sandwiches are pretty good, I'm used to more crusty bread like back home.  Easy to spend more than you intended, but worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"First time for Christmas 2016, place was hopping  staff are great and friendly and and most of all helpful  got people through fast.
My order for lasagna was ready to go ,I added a couple sandwiches to go at the last minute at check out staff notice I was handicapped and were more then willing to assist me carrying my order out to the car. Beth was fantastic!
The best part was the smell of Italian food cooking and warming and listening to other customers picking up cannoli orders.
Btw, my sausage/peppers&onions and my wife's No. 21 sub were outstanding, I'll be 
Back!"}
{"text":"Best cannoli around. But the attitude of the staff is glaringly bad - unless you're Italian.  It's family operated, this staff is family. I asked  once why they weren't open past 6pm, for dinner. I was told because the neighborhood is bad. The neighborhood is bad and it reflects in their attitude toward their customers. The past half a dozen times I've been there, I was treated pleasantly once.  My daughter enjoys the chicken parm & my dad occasionally asks for the cannoli or I would not shop here. They're on my way home from work, otherwise I drive out of my way to get to them. Not worth it to me. My daughter and my dad don't have to deal with these rude, rude people. When you walk in the door, in addition to a buzzer, they have a mechanical voice that says \"front door\". I walk in and say a cheery good morning. They grunt to themselves and go back to their work. The attitude just gets worse as you're shopping and checking out."}
{"text":"LOVE THE SUBS AND DESSSERTS! Fast friendly service everything is delicious my favorite is their cheesecake hubby loves their limoncello also delicious pizza great I like the variety in drinks keeps it interesting ok I LOVE EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Had heard of Romanelli's, but was never on that side of town at the right time to check it out. This time it really worked out. We ordered two sandwiches - Meatball and The George. Both were on 10 inch hoagie rolls. 

The meatball was piled high with meatballs, sauce, and cheese. The George was packed with meat and topped with sweet & hot peppers. The bread was fantastic. It was crusty, but not so hard that you could bite into it.

We split a cannoli for dessert. Crunchy and sweet. 

I would highly recommend Romanelli's. Worth the trip.

N*joy..."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we're so excited to come across an authentic Italian food.
Immediately they made you feel like one of the family. Can't wait to visit our new ASU student so we can come back for more."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious  very very good sandwiches and treats with smiling pleasant staff! 
The Roberts special was my favorite but my husbands Italian stallion was really good too!!! 
I wish I lived closer but I will definitely be stopping by for my Italian cravings when I need a fix or when I am in the area!!! 
While we were leaving someone was walking out with a pizza to take home and bake!! It looked sooo good"}
{"text":"Love it.

Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.

It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  

When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.

I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.

Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for specialty items. I went here looking for unfilled canolli shells. There they were, right in front as I walked in. I loved that. I really don't like to ask where things are, so it was a bonus. 

I wandered the aisles a bit, and listened to the conversation around the place. A woman was talking about being a transplant from Chicago, and the proprietor told her all about some of the products they sold that were specific from that area. I liked the atmosphere.

I liked the variety of products sold, especially the large selection of drinks and things like that. Pretty cool!

My only difficulty was getting out of the parking lot. Blah. I hate traffic, and this place is close to a busy intersection. 

Other than that, no complaints!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this family owned business for years and love it! At the deli I always get the Italian stallion which is Delicious. The meat is always very fresh. They also have wise potato chips and Italian ice. Brings me back to my childhood growing up in New Jersey! Every time I stop in I always grab a few jars for their homemade spaghetti sauce. It is amazing and isn't to high in sodium. It's for sure the next best thing to making it yourself. I love the staff here as well. They are very friendly and will take care of you."}
{"text":"Romanelli's is the most amazing italian deli that one can ever come across in Phoenix. 

It is located down the street from the high school that I went to and we used to stop most days for some cheese pizza or \"Italian Stallion\" sandwich. Now that I have grown this is a prime place to shop for my own culinary needs such as pastas, cold cuts, pizza toppings, sauces and even hommade pizza dough just waiting to be thawed and used to make your own delicious pizzas.

I still stop in for the occassional sandwish and the \"Italian Stallion\" is still my top choice. Ham, capicolla,  grnoa salami, pepperoni and provalone cheese piles high with onions thinnly shredded lettuce tomatoes and of course bread soggy with dressing as it should be. And don't forget to follow it up with your favorite italian sweet. I haven't had a bad dessert yet.

The service is prompt and charmingly brusque. A real New York feeling here. 

If its authenticity you are after this is your place..anywhere else? Fuggedaboudit!!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for over 35 years, not a lot of time on the East coast. But, here in AZ where no building lasts for more than 60 years , it is astonishing!
True right up front, it is in a rough hood. But, maybe you should just go during the day.
The selection here in the Groceries is without comparison. 
They have everything Italian you could want.....Imported from Italy. Of course.
They make their own sausage there,(you can buy it in the meat case.) 
It is by far, THE BEST we have ever had any where.
It even drove the dog crazy when I just brought it in the house. The smell is so good! 
The choices for the food and cook ware,as well as gifts are fantastic. 
I have not been able to eat lunch there but ,next time we will. So far the first 3 times have just been Grocery shopping.
I live just over 50 miles round trip from this Deli , Bakery. Every mile is worth it.
I cannot believe I had never been here till October.
I have since recommended it to every Italian I know. Oh yes, it is that good.
If I could give them 10 stars ,I would."}
{"text":"A Rare Find.Thank You.Late Afternoon On Tuesday January 2,2018 Marked my Third Visit to pick up a to go order. Amazing all the way across the board from start to finish.Fine example of Customer Service The way it used to be and nice to know it still exists.Starting with my initial phone call to place my order, on all three occassions the Gentleman who answered the phone was efficient and friendly.Upon arrival I was Politely Greeted by Down to Earth Staff.The overall atmosphere was Inviting,The Store was incredibly clean and seemed well stocked with inventory.The folks in the deli preparing the food were friendly and energetic.The Cashier also pleasant and down to earth treated me with respect.The food amazing.I ordered two Lasagna Dinners one with Meatballs and one With Sausage as well as a slice of Cheesecake,Tiramisu,and The Lemon cello Desserts.Wow!So Delicious."}
{"text":"Established in the 70s, matching decor gives it character. The proof of NY style deli is in on the menu. Meat's and cheeses important directly from Italy, both hot & mild Capicola ham. Full selection of pasta's (+gluten free) & sauce's. Staff's friendly & ate knowledgeable pro's.  Usually order the Italian stallion sub, never disappointed until I have to leave. Worth the drive, bring cash."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Any Italian in phoenix or Arizona for that matter would be crazy not to visit romanellis. Eat in and take home everything. From fresh made cannoli to frozen gnocchi and everything in between its an amazing family owned and operated business.  From the time you walk in your are in their home. Thank you for a great place that brings back the Italian village feel in the desert."}
{"text":"Since I found this hidden gem I come here when I'm craving a good pastrami.  Their other sandwiches are good too!  The pastries are good but I think the cannoli can be done better.  Over all though... I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I pulled into the parking lot of the ghetto looking mini mall that Romanelli's is tucked into and parked right in front. 

In the last few minutes of enjoying the A/C in my car, I looked around at the writing all over the windows of Romanelli's and saw the entrance to the right and exit to the left... I was instantly taken back to my summer backpacking in Italy.  If you have ever visited Italy, and you never had to visit the supermercato while you were there, then you have no idea what I'm talking about, but for those of you that have been broke and backpacking, you know what I mean when I say this place has the same set up as an authentic Italian market-- a designated entrance, and very far away, usually after walking through the entire store, a designated exit.

And don't you dare go in through the exit... I don't know why, but it is heavily frowned upon.

Anyway, the only reason I came here was because I had a cannoli craving.  I picked up a Rockstar and two cannoli (one for me, one for my grandma), for about $10- kinda pricey, but it was worth it.

Best. Cannoli. In Phoenix.

If you had to make me choose, I'd go the Godfather route... take the cannoli, leave the gun.."}
{"text":"The meatball sandwiches are big, and very good. I like mine with extra sauce. That's the only sandwich I've tried but it's because it's so good I haven't gotten around to the others. And when you walk into the shop there's a big case of Italian butter cookies which are very fresh. I recommend the ladyfingers that are partly dipped in chocolate and fresh coconut."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots for lunch, best hot sandwich in town: There's a lot of \"sandwich shops\" out there, non come close to Romanelli's.

I've also catered food for parties and corporate events a handful of times. They've never disappointed, highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Originally I never even heard of this place. It was like a hidden gem. My Italian coworker told me about it when I told him I had trouble finding a place that can make a good cannoli. (I can make them myself but I don't want to). 

We got our sandwiches to go. The sandwiches were super good. They had great quality ingredients. I would definitely return again. The only thing I didn't like about this place is the location. It seems kinda scary if I were to go alone at night. However, they close at 6pm. But inside, it's very cute. They have a bunch of stuff for sale like little signs, a great olive oil selection, a bunch of baked goods, and other imported awesomeness. If I had more money I probably would have spent like $100 on a few olive oils in there. 

The workers were efficient and very nice. It was a very pleasant experience. 

But back to the sandwiches: the bread was fresh and had great flavor. I'm super picky on bread. I think if a place has terrible bread, everything else can only be mediocre at best. It had a great texture, wasn't overly dense or too chewy. We wanted to try a few different sandwiches. We had the 19, which is Robert's special (our new favorite)-$7.99. It had roast beef, pastrami, provolone, tomato, mayo & onion. It was everything you want a hot sandwich to taste like that didn't have anything fried on it. I was glad they didn't put too much mayo on it. I'm generally not a fan of mayo. But all the flavors worked well together. I'd be back just based on that sandwich alone. We also tried 15, their super sub with ham, capicolla, pepperoni & I don't remember what kind of cheese-$7.99. It was good though. That one wasn't anything spectacular, but we were definitely not disappointed. We got 7, the \"Italian stallion\" house sub.-$6.99. It had ham, capicolla, genoa salami, pepperoni & provolone. I liked this one a lot too. It had a great combination of flavors. I would recommend this one as well. The last sandwich we brought home was 18, George's special-$7.99. It had ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella (a pink Italian sausage made of finely ground pork, & smooth textured) , pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers. They asked if we wanted mild or hot peppers. We of course, wanted hot peppers. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but it also was pretty awesome. Everything worked well together in the sandwich. I loved the slight crunch from the hot peppers as well as that extra \"zing\" it adds. 

And the whole reason that we went there, the cannoli-$2.99. I only bought one and I wish I bought more. I'm kind of glad I didn't though because I probably could have eaten a bunch. It had a good texture for the cannoli shell. It wasn't soggy or rock hard. The filling was great. It wasn't overly sweet. It didn't have raisins, so I was really glad about that. It probably could have used a little bit more mascarpone in the filling, but it was still extremely delicious and a really great treat. I will buy more of these when I'm back too. I can't wait to try the other yummy looking treats as well."}
{"text":"So after hearing about this deli I had to go. All I can say is. It was like good sex I wanted to have a cigarette after but then I remembered I don't smoke outstanding place. The locations not the best but sometimes that's where the greatest places are hidden give it a try I'm sure you'll agree."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Excellent food and wonderful service. Huge assortment of meats and cheeses."}
{"text":"I took my other half for a Birthday lunch and shopping experience. My other half is born Brazilian but to 3/4 Italian family.  What can I say... He was very happy in the store... Pointing out things that he has not seen since in Brazil, in his families supermarket/deli.  
The food was really really good. I inhaled my 4 cheese Lasagna, where he could not finish his . Meet an owner I believe, she was super sweet and showed us around store. We even talked coffee and pasta! 
Yes we will be back, I love Local business, especially if they good!  

Thank you!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on accident while working on the westside. I had George's Special.... Best sandwich I've had in a long time. I'd take a picture but it's all gone. Fresh ingredients, great staff behind the counter, and full of regulars. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE THE BEST BREAD IN THE WORLD!  I have to bring a loaf of their Semolina bread everytime that I go to my Mother's house for dinner. Their deli meats and cheeses are Boarshead which combined with their bread makes for terrific sandwiches.

On one occasion when my Husband and I went to get sandwiches, I grumbled a bit about their not having any Diet Dr. Pepper in any of the drinks coolers. When I went back a couple of months later, they had Diet Dr. Pepper available. I don't know if it had anything to do with me, but I sure was impressed. 

And can't forget their wonderful Biscotti.

I just wished they were open later then 6 pm."}
{"text":"Went here seeking food like I used to get on the East coast in New York
Well it's not New York food but it was good and made to order or grab and go options
Canollis were very good"}
{"text":"Great little place.  They have great sweet treats and their subs are awesome.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now . I bring a new buddy every time . Trying to spread the word this place is legit."}
{"text":"How have I lived 3 miles from this place for 8 years and had never been in until a few weeks ago!?!?!

Man, I was doing it all wrong. Home made sausage, good Italian pasta, San Marzano tomatoes, everything you need to make a great meal all in one shop, with a side of personality!

I haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but looking at the big old hock of prosciutto de parma in their cooler, I'll be back for those next!"}
{"text":"This place has homemade Italian sausage, great sandwhiches, imported Italian meats and cheeses, a selection of hot daily specials for lunch and dinner, and that's just the back counter.

There also have a great selection of pastas, sauses, and a delightful array of jarred and canned goodies; everything from olives to grape leaves to tomatoes.

They are not open on Sundays, which has burned me once or twice, but that's the only negative thing I can say about this place.  Just try it and fall in love!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful market and a deli full of delicious items...not to mention a bakery too! We had soup and sandwiches...perfection. We also purchased a loaf of bread and Italian sausages, some sauce and pasta. We fixed it later for dinner and the family loved everything. This is our new favorite spot. If you enjoy good quality food, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and decided to stop in for lunch. I was sold by the sign indicating they were voted New Times best Italian deli'
I found the staff to be outgoing. And accommodating.
I ordered chicken parm sub. The chicken parm portion was pre made...awhile ago....as the breading had a glue like texture. 
I also selected 1/3 lb of Italian butter cookies @12.99/lb. The cookies were stale and I'm gonna guess they sat in a freezer for a good long time, as they possessed a very strong freezer burnt flavor. 
Lastly, I ordered a plain cannoli. The cannoli was pretty D. good. The ricotta cheese was blended to a very smooth texture...yum!
While I waited for my sandwich to be made I did a lap in the store to check out the imports. I did note the freezer stock does not appear to move. Lots of items showing signs of age in the refrigerator/freezer case, like rusty sardine cans and frozen pastas that are dried, cracked and tired. 
I found that leaving the product in place combined with the other things previously mentioned left me with a rather negative impression.
I did take note of the dried meats and aged cheese's, there was a large selection of what I assumed to be imported items, maybe I will stop in and try some capi-lami-chutto sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are always very nice and helpful. My favorite is the Italian Stallion; add a cannoli and you are in heaven, my fiend! If the pope makes it out here, that would be the lunch I would recommend."}
{"text":"Bought some baked goods.  Very good.  All of the staff here or friendly and helpful.  I didn't try any of their sandwiches.  Probably worth it.   I thought their canned goods, tomatoes tomato paste etc were outrageously expensive.  I go back to get the Italian sausage pepperoni etc. but absolutely nothing else.  Way overpriced.  It was a nice deli though parking a little tight even though they had several spots.   Nice deli feel about the place"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. We got a turkey sub and an Italian meats sub for $7.99 each. Great quality ingredients. The bread was the best part! The seating area was nice and clean. 
This place has a full deli and bakery area. We left with a tiramisu and lemon bars, but they also had fresh bread, cookies and cakes! They also have a store area where you can buy specialty items like pasta."}
{"text":"The best italian deli I've been to in Phoenix.  As soon as I walked in the smell reminded me of deli's back home in Phila/NJ.  YUM YUM YUM!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot. The deli is super helpful too. My daughter has a sever dairy allergy and they took the time to check ingredients for me. So helpful."}
{"text":"Soo Good! Seriously the best Italian food place I have ever been to! Pasta, sandwiches, and desserts. Really anything you need to satisfy your tummy!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch again yesterday and it was as good or even better than the first time. I had the Georges Special and some potato salad and both were outstanding. My mouth is watering now just thinking about  it.

I sure wish this place wasn't 37 miles away as I'd go back today for lunch if it were closer."}
{"text":"When I'm in AZ for the winter, this Jersey girl misses great Italian food, so I asked the guy at the Walmart deli counter at 19th Ave/Bell if he knew of a great Italian deli nearby. He sent me straight to Romanelli's, and I've been going there every winter ever since. I've even thrown spaghetti dinners for my East Coast friends and relatives in Phoenix and all ingredients are from Romanelli's. Their meatballs are divine. I will never make another meatball from scratch again. Their red gravies are also delicious, and so are the breads and cannolis (this coming from someone who visits Little Italy in NYC like its Mecca), so when I'm in Phoenix, I go straight to Romanelli's instead of making it myself from scratch. Sorry Mom!"}
{"text":"I like to go here to grab some subs on the way to the river, since it's between our house and the 17. Just because I don't want to go to Subway or Blimpie's.

Mostly, it's a rather expansive Italian market. Need olive oil? They have 20+ different kinds. Pasta? There's a whole aisle. How about one of those wooden thingies for making gnocchi. Got that too.

In the back, a counter runs along the whole length of the back wall. That's where you'll find all sorts of cheeses, cold cuts, and sausauge, plus a few sweets. 

It's also where you order sandwiches. And you'd better know exactly what your want, and fast. The man behind the counter is perpetually surly and curt. It gets worse if you stand there and try to make heads or tails of all the hand-written sandwich combinations taped to the wall. Luckily, the woman who runs the cash register is always very sweet. So that kind of makes up for it.

I want to love their sandwiches. I just don't. They're OK. The meat is always really good, there just isn't enough of it. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things. 

Until then, I'll continue to support Romanelli's, but they'll only get a so-so rating for the deli. The product selection, however, is top notch."}
{"text":"This was dad favorite west side Italian deli.. He got his bread here and sub rolls but go early they sell out.. my niece loved there subs.. Good stuff Family owned..."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian delis around, not just in Phoenix, but ever! Fresh rolls with endless combinations of deli meats and cheeses. They have a sandwich menu, but you can pretty much get anything you want from their case of Boar's Head meats and cheese and hot food selections. 

Some of my favorites are the Italian Stallion, meatball, and Robert's Special. But lately, Robert's Special has had my heart, perfect combo of roast beef and pastrami, swiss, mayo, tomato, and onions toasted to perfection. It's gotten to the point that when Robert sees me walk up to the counter he already knows I want his namesake sandwich. All the sandwiches are HUUGE and only $10 with chips and a drink. 

Romanelli's is a family run place and in addition to an amazing deli, they're also a small Italian market with everything from homemade cannolis to frozen raviolis to ten different type of canned olives. You can also order hot food from the deli to go and/or cater food. All the staff are amazing and super friendly and you feel like you're apart of the fam (or maybe I just go too much?). And like any good catholic, they're closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time in close to twenty years and it was better than I remember it being.

The deli sandwiches were as good as any I have had in Philly , Chicago or Kansas City.

All of your Italian specialty foods are available.  They even have decaf espresso. 

So stop by have a sandwich in the deli, take home some canoli and enjoy some espresso."}
{"text":"the smell as u enter is enuf for me to know mmmmmmnewyork. everything else proves it, too. everything u never knew u needed and all u ever want."}
{"text":"As far as Italian deli's go, this place is the real deal.  It's a fantastic and authentic deli and market.  The only problem is that it's in a horrible neighborhood with scummy and questionable characters...both outside, as well as patrons inside.  If you can deal with the substandard humans, then go for it.  You won't be disappointed with the authenticity and quality."}
{"text":"Best fucking Cannoli's in Arizona (possibly west of the mississippi)....

...No need to say anything more. 

Go here, eat one, now."}
{"text":"One of the best service experiences I've ever had. Asked if I needed water when I coughed just once, kept asking if I needed help or suggestions, kind and patient people. 

Oh, and the food? Definitely some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Like wow. The smell is intoxicating. Can't wait to try more from them"}
{"text":"I can't believe how many times I flew by this place and never gave it a thought

Great sandwiches made fresh, great service, and you should really try the desserts! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place? The real deal Italian huh - oh you mean the place that features a giant microwave oven right in the middle of their prep area. I order a chicken cutlet hero and the next thing you know is the guy is picking up some patties or round things and tossing it in the nuker on a paper towel (just like at home). I say something about it and he is like \"im just warming them up and then I'm gonna throw them down there\" Down there was another oven below the microwave.
   Whatever he had planned for those chicken cutlets I wasn't about to find out and hoofed it out of the place. Maybe places do nuke their cutlets, but this time I'm watching and I'm not eating rubbery chicken and they should ashamed of themselves anyway. 
   Romanelli's - 35 years of microwaving food. Manja people."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for lunch - their food is great, and if you want an authentic Italian deli and grocery, the selection can't be beat.  The deli counter spans the entire back of the store, where you can get meats, cheeses, sandwiches, and prepared dishes.  The rest of the store is the grocery and bakery, and the baked goods are fantastic.

The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is customer service.  Friendly, but a little rushed most of the time.  But you'll get a great lunch, and some great Italian delicacies you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"From the outside you might be unsure about going in to eat, but please do. This is an amazing little market/ deli/ restaurant all rolled into one. The store is very user friendly & is easy to find items you are looking for, if for some reason you can't find it the staff is more than willing to help & give suggestions if needed. The deli is great, good fresh bread & meat. I love the dressing they put on the sandwiches. The pastas, hot or cold are great as well. It's fast and easy to get in and out if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Arizona is in desperate need of more delis.  Romanellis is one of the best.  I picked up some spicey homemade Italian sausage, fresh parmesean cheese, and fresh baked french bread the other night and made some of the most delicious pasta I've had in a very long time.  If you are looking for an Italian deli in Phoenix that has a wide variety of goods this is the spot.  You will pay much more here than you would if you went to the grocery store but you will not be getting the same authenticity.  Seems how great Italian delis are hard to find in AZ it comes down to Economics 101 - supply and demand."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Deli for about 15 years and it's always great! Really nice, friendly folks too. It's very clean and actuall smells clean. Compared to the best New York Delis, Romanelli's is as good or better than any of them! It's also a bakery, restaurant, grocery store, gift shop, imported appliance store and more. They have actual San Marzano Italian tomatoes and Stanislaus \"Alta Cucina\" California grown copy cat San Marzano style tomatoes. You can't get either just anywhere. They also have a selection of Pasta machines too! I love this store!

It's also the only place (I know of) in Phoenix to get sausage casings! I always get some Olives while I'm there because they're the best anywhere. I'm glad I got plenty of real, fresh mozerella mini balls. I planned to make a nice pasta salad with fresh Mozzarella, Basil & Cherry Tomatoes, except the Mozzarella was so good I ate it all!!!! LOL Now I have to go again! A+++++"}
{"text":"Very NY style Italian deli. They have great sandwiches and homemade cookies."}
{"text":"Cool little joint. Had a lot of east coast brands that felt like home.  Prices are inflated a little bit so that knocks off a star. I would say that this is the closest thing to an east coast deli in the valley of the sun.  If you are in the area, definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native, you need certain things for making Italian beef.  Romanelli's has 'em!  They aren't the cheapest,  but beats paying to ship jars of giardineria out :)  Their sub rolls are very good too, haven't tried much else but I'll be back."}
{"text":"First, the service was outstanding! Very friendly people. They made you feel like you were part of the family. Had some sub sandwiches - they were okay. Not bad but nothing special. I thought the prices for their grocery items were on the high side. I'm new to Phoenix so perhaps this is because Italian items are harder to come by than on the East coast? Just a guess. We were really disappointed in the cookies. They looked great! We picked out just under a dozen different varieties and they all tasted the same: stale. I don't know if they were baked too long ago or if had soaked up the smells of various sandwich meats, but they all tasted like they had been in a fridge with other foods for quite a while. They were expensive, too. The last disappointment was that we realized that they had charged us a service fee (without telling us) for using our credit card. And since we bought the cookies separately (after our meal) we got charged this fee twice."}
{"text":"Wow, went to Romanelli's today for the first time, this place not only smells fantastic, the food is awesome!  Do not wait, go there....now!  I had the Italian sub, it was wonderful and only $4.95 for a half, which is plenty for one person."}
{"text":"Italian deli and groceries. I stumbled upon Romanelli's through my daughter's boyfriend. His family love Italian food and have lived in the Moon Valley area for a long time. We decided to try out their subs for dinner. Their Italian bread subs were much larger than I expected. They toast it beautifully before stuffing them with meats and cheeses. You have the option of wheat and white breads as well. I decided on Italian as per recommendation of the proprietors.

The meatball sub was my favorite. The meatballs were large and juicy, smothered with cheesy goodness on crunchy toasted bread.

The Italian Stallion is lovely if you like cold cuts. It came with a variety of rich Italian meats. I am afraid I cannot name them. I would love to taste them individually the next time, but I admit that I wolfed my portion down.

The chicken Parmigiana sub was okay. I admit that I am a sucker for the freshly battered and fried then smothered sandwich. This one was not. It was a cooked breast with tomato sauce and cheese cooked concoction.

The baked ziti was rich and cheesy as well. It almost looked like lasagna. It came with a nice piece of garlic bread.

Finally, the cannoli was crispy and filled with a light, creamy filling with a hint of cinnamon and vanilla. Delicious! It was a delightful meal that fed 5 people for $42."}
{"text":"Tried out the Italian Stallion sandwich, which is their selection of Italian cold cuts. Comes with Italian dressing and also added hot peppers. Really good sandwich.

Also, got a slice of cheesecake and an eclair for dessert. These were excellent."}
{"text":"I feel so lucky to have had good service and Awesome sandwiches from this place!!!!  Have you have not been here I highly recommend it!!! 5 stars is not enough 10 PS it is Closed on Sunday"}
{"text":"This must be my lucky month. I'm discovering more and more places that serve foods that remind me of my favorite stomping grounds in NYC. I've been to Romanelli's earlier this year, on March 19 - the feast of St. Joseph, to see if they sold those wonderful special filled zeppoles named after the saint and sold in Italian bakeries and food stores on his feast day. They did, and the pastries were delicious. I also browsed the packaged and canned goods areas and found lots of high quality Italian foods not normally found in supermarkets and regular food stores. 

But it was today after reading the reviews here that I decided to try the deli. I ordered the Italian Stallion sub and it was really, really good! The meats were very high quality, fresh and ample, and there was just enough lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and dressing to enhance the flavors without competing with the deli meats. It's so good to know that there is a great deli place not far from where I live, and where I can treat myself to or bring visiting friends for a great New York style deli experience."}
{"text":"If your a NY/NJ transplant to Phoenix and miss the Italian Bakery & Deli that you took for granted in your old neighborhood then rest assured because Romanelli's will make you feel like your back home.

Great cold cuts and subs.  Everything high quality.  Amazing homemade Italian sausage.  You got your Polly-O cheeses like back east and Wise potatoe chips and cheese doodles.  

Everyone mentions the Canolli and it deserves it.  I am not sure its the best I have ever had but its up there and they will get you fresh ones upon request with no hassle.  

Everything is fresh and everything is delicious and for a NY/NJ transplant it is a refreshing spot when feeling a little homesick!  

They even got great freshly baked Italian cookies and breads.  

Thank God for Romanelli's!!!"}
{"text":"Someone told me that there was an Italian deli/bakery that had all the NY goodies I grew up on so we had to take the hour plus ride to try it out. They had rainbow cookies, butter cookies, heros, hot and cold food,  tons of Italian specialty items that you will not be able to find in The local supermarkets. We got a chicken cutlet hero, spiced ham and cheese hero, spaghetti and meatballs, rainbow cookies, butter cookies. Everything was great! Def will remember next we are going to be in that area again."}
{"text":"Our first time going and WOW we were so pleased!! Meatballs were the best I ever had!  Counter service was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Best sandwiches EVER!!!! Everything is so fresh & good. Been coming here for years, everyone is always nice & friendly."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS - I think I may just be Romanelli's new biggest fan! It is a good thing that it is about 40 minutes from my house, otherwise I would most likely be there a few times a week! My husband and I were running an errand on the west side of town and were craving sandwiches. I quickly pulled out my Yelp app and 2 options came up within a few block radius - 1) Blimpie and 2) Romanelli's - ummmmmm, local love all day baby! Naturally, we went with Romanelli's and are SO glad that we did. 

I ordered their Italian sandwich on white bread with all of the fixins and it was so dang good! The bread was soft and perfect and you could tell the meats were HIGH quality! Romanelli's is also an Italian grocer so we picked up some delicious pickled goods and freshly baked Italian pastries that were to die for. We'll absolutely be back when in the area and will most likely find ourselves making the 40 minute drive just to get it! Do yourself a favor and stop in for a delicious meal at this lovely family-owned and operated establishment."}
{"text":"Ate there forc the first time and my sandwiches were awesome. So much better than subway. I would send my friends and family there"}
{"text":"I went into Romanelli's today for the first time at the recommendation from a friend. It smelled so good when I walked in! The lady behind the counter greeted me right away and could sense my confusion on where to place an order and pointed me in the right direction. 

I ordered the Robert special and then ended up taking a lasagna home. The sandwich was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and helpful.

It was pretty busy and I heard someone yell they needed more cannolis in the front and someone behind the deli counter yell back they would bring them up. It was pretty funny just listening to the banter back and forth. There is a pretty impressive selection of grocery items and frozen pastas as well as novelty items. When I was checking out I asked about the cannolis and asked her if she was related to the guy at the deli counter. She explained it is a family owned business and she's been friends with the family since grade school. I was told the cannolis are made fresh every day and she had run out and that's why she was yelling for more to be made. I asked about placing larger orders and was provided a menu so I could see what my options were. 

I would definitely go back again even though it's out of my way but I can stop on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Get George's Special with giardiniera, and grab a Bundeburg Ginger Beer.

I know this review was terse, but if you haven't been here before, this is all the information you need."}
{"text":"Romanelli's Deli and Bakery, if that doesn't sound Italian nothing does.  I was heading north on 35th Ave and passed Dunlap on my way to give Rocket subs another try.  Out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed the sign for Romanelli's and immediately flipped a u-turn, left a little Z rubber on the pavement and scooted back to Romanelli's.

It's located on the south side of Dunlap, just east of 35th avenue in a small non-descript strip mall but the sign is large and you really can't miss it.  You enter one door on the west and exit a little ways east by the cash register.

This is a great little Italian grocery/deli/bakery.  If Italian is what you're looking for, there's a good chance it's here.  Cases of San Marazano tomatoes, pastas, sauces, exotic olive oils, etc.

I wanted lunch and had heard great things about their sandwiches.  All true.  I had the 10\" supersub with  1/2 lb of meat (ham, capicolla, pepperoni, and cheese along with red onions, lettuce and tomato).  Choice of bread is white, wheat, Italian.  The Italian bread has a harder crust than the white so I opted for the white; I tend to like softer food.  I also grabbed a cane sugar cherry soda from the case.  The sandwich was excellent, very good, bread was spot on and the meat was tasty and sliced fresh.  I stayed and ate onsite; they have a number of tables to sit at.  I was charged an extra $1 for the soda because I was eating onsite, not sure why, kind of struck me as odd.

Finished the meal with a handmade chocolate cannolli which almost caused an accident from my eyes rolling back into my head while I was driving, it was so good!  I had hoped to eat half and save half for later today but it didn't even make it to two blocks to I-17.  Between the cannolli and the cane sugar soda I'm in no danger of low blood sugar tonight.

This is a family operation and they were all exceedingly helpful and polite, it was a refreshing change from the \"chain\" mentality.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried their lasagna and its the best ive ever had. This is real authentic Italian Food highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love the Capicola and Provolone cheese on French bread! Great sandwich.
All the meats and cheeses and sausage are great here.
Been a family business for years.
I found this place when I moved to Phoenix 25 years ago.
Been to a lot of others places but this is the best."}
{"text":"I head to Romanelli's for their deli section and eat in .... their food is fantastic.  True Italian food ... no one I've been there with has been disappointed.  Make sure you come hungry because portions are BIG and you will leave stuffed.  They also have a huge assortment of grocery items (ie - pasta sauce, pasta, etc)"}
{"text":"I love the pastries here and have been getting zeppoli here for St. Joseph's Day for maybe the past 5 years. Even though they normally make them over the weekend before the holiday, they made mine early this year because I wanted to bring them to work today. It's that kind of willingness that makes a great business even better! Thanks folks, happy St. Joseph's Day :-)"}
{"text":"We stopped by here to get a small bite for a friend. What a treasure we happened to find! I wish we would've had more time and hunger to try more than just cannoli. The Cannoli was good!  Be prepared for the quintessential group of older guys leering at you and making appreciative noises - Seriously felt like we popped out of a movie set for Goodfellas."}
{"text":"Went there with the wife last week.  We've been there before and the food is always excellent but until now I've never done a review...my fault.
I had a Georges Italian sub.  It just couldn't have been better! Period.
Wife had her usual Sweet Italian Sausage w/ roasted peppers and stuff.  She adores them.  
Everything I've had has been great but I won't ever order anything except a Georges again.  You can't improve on perfection."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

My boyfriend and I waltzed in early evening time, not knowing that they were closed and on their way to lock the door.  We both felt terrible and were going to leave but were INVITED to stay and order whatever we wanted!  They insisted!  I couldn't believe the hospitality and customer service.  Most places would gladly give you the boot and hurry home (not that I blame 'em!), but Romanelli's was different.  They even made conversation with us.  Another plus?  The hot pastas are DELICIOUS.

Side note:  They bottle their own pasta sauce!  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Coming from New Jersey finding a good Italian deli was as easy as driving 5 minutes away. Here in Arizona I've checked out some of the other \"Italian delis\" and most are mediocre at best, including the ones in Scottsdale. Romanelli's has that old school deli feel, good selection and knows how to put a sandwich together."}
{"text":"I love this place! And the staff is extremely friendly. The sandwiches are huge and delicious! But the amazing part of this place is the giant case of Italian butter cookies when you walk in. Cookie Heaven!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Transplanted from Brooklyn for only a few months, I was already missing good Italian bread! Thought the situation was hopeless until I found this place! Stopped by for an Italian Stallion hero (I can't bring myself to say sub) and it was delicious. The fact that when I went to stand up I discovered bread crumbs all over my lap was the topping. The crust needs to be crisp with the inside soft. Yes! Cold cuts and dressing were good too. My jaw dropped when I saw they carry Pastosa ravioli and manicotti. Hands down, the best! Not a great neighborhood. Small parking lot. So what??? Go!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Italian deli and grocery store. Grocery prices are high"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great!!! Prices could be little more inexpensive for items such as off brand chips and for there fountain sodas.  But the sandwiches were very fulfilling. Meat was freshly cut and bread was perfect with no dry ends like from some other sandwich places. Definitely would recommend to people."}
{"text":"All the five-star reviews pretty much covered this place, but I thought I'd pile on anyway.  The groceries, the subs, the house made olives, everything is great! 

The mozzarella sub is absolutely amazing. If they would bring back seeded sub rolls I would be in heaven."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and service! They also have a store and bakery with all the Italians ingredients and treats you need."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for a place to get decent lunch meat and Romanelli's is an awesome choice. I had a sandwich while waiting for my stuff to get cut and it was excellent. They had an awesome dry salami that I wish I could remember the name of. One of the guys said it came out of San Francisco. This place is worth driving across town to get to."}
{"text":"Wish they had more fish options. But the sweets and meat look amazing! Cant wait to get home to try everything!"}
{"text":"Learned about this deli in December and finally made it there today. So glad I made it there. Had a Italian sandwitch and it was great. This is the first sandwitch I have had in 10 years that has great bread. Robert brought me out a meatball to try and it was great. The perfect mix of beef and pork with some breadcrumb and baked to perfection. My original intention for going here today was for the proper ingredients for dinner tonight. Found Nina brand tomatoes with basil and some fresh cheese ravioli. I drove nearly thirty minutes to eat and shop here and will be back many times. The retail section on its own is great with several olive oils and basalmics to choose from. The deli counter has the proper amounts of pancetta and fresh provisions. This place could be very costly if you go there hungry."}
{"text":"My plane seat neighbor told me to swing by this grocery/deli for some sfogatelle, so I did just so--excellent quality deli food!
We ordered lasagna, and 3 subs to go, along with some sfogatelle pastries.

Although I wish they had offered to warm up the pastry, I enjoyed the lemon flavored custard filled triangle (you find pastries next to the cash register, made fresh!).
The lasagna and hot subs tasted amazing--the Italian bread is fresh and baked just right. I wasn't a big fan of the cold subs we got, but it's just a preference.

Another tip: the subs are a foot long, for about $8 to $10. We thought they were personal sandwhiches, and got more than our own fill."}
{"text":"This is bar far hands down the best sub I've ever eaten in my life. I'm a native from Arizona and very sad I had not discovered this place till just a few months ago. It's a must try... Great lil authentic Italian Market too."}
{"text":"Great subs! Come hungry portions are plenty.  Deli also has a good variety of meats. Italian Stallion is great!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to have a real reason to go back here. We were doing a foodie market tour today and this was suggested as our last stop( my buddy Tom had to take home fresh cannolis home to the womenfolk). My plan is to go back for delicious sub sandwiches since this place is close to work . Why haven't gotten lunch here already ?  They have great Italian grocery supplies like the Stella Dora cookies I remember as a kid living in Jersey.  I also perused the San Marino tomatoes and pondered the differences from \"regular\" canned tomatoes. At 7.00 bucks a can I guess I won't ever know. I rather spend my money on baked goodies in the front case. My husband , the wonderful Michael  surprised me with a eclair . You know he loves me!"}
{"text":"I had to give this place a try after I read a review that this place was better than Defalco's. Funny how that Yelper didn't have a review for Defalco's. How silly of me to being swayed so easily by a cumulative 4 1/2 Yelp review. Romanelli's is a decent place with friendly owners and employees but the parking is not fun during the traditional lunch hours. 

I had the hot Chicken Parmesan sandwich that was maybe 10-12 inches long. The bread and the chicken was delicious, albeit a little up there on the price scale at $8.99. I would say the food was 4 stars for me and the parking which is part of the experience for me was a 2. I would rate this place 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of the Subway Chain or On- Cor Frozen Dinners this is the place for YOU!

My husband tried the recommended George's Special. It's almost an Italian Style Hoagie. The quality of the meats aren't as bad as Subway but it was pre-portioned and made possibly days in advance and is all old and squashed together. They apologized to us and said they didn't have their normal rolls. The roll they had when we were there was a squishy roll that fell apart. The sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing.  But on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option.

They offer a sandwich of the day and also have a special board. The special of the day was Eggplant Rollatini. I thought that sounds good I'll try that. They all start running around and maybe five minutes later they tell me they are out of Eggplant Rollatini and my husband spots them pulling out from the freezer a big plastic frozen tray of them. 

So I go for the Sandwich of the day. It was corned beef on a roll. I asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better. They asked me if I wanted it cold or warm and I answered warm please. The people working seemed very confused making my sandwich. They toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave. It was a very generous portion of corned beef but it was a mediocre quality. I tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed.

I saw chicken parmesan patties under a heat lamp and they looked like they were formed and processed just like those On-Cor Frozen Dinners that I remember from my childhood.

My husband purchased some of their house made Hot sausage. He cooked it as soon as we got home. He said it had a good flavor but it was unusually dry.

I would never come here again to eat anything but the store here is above average for an Italian Deli place.

1.5 Stars Rounded up for the store."}
{"text":"FANTASTICO....
The absolute best pastrami in the valley.... Really.... Better than any.... Great subs. Husband had the Italian. Son had the \"George\" It was Fab... The flavors... The meat... The breads... The lettuce... The dressing.... Everything was fresh and fab... I had the Pastrami.... New York style. WOW..... Mom had the greek salad which was great. Shared some cannolis etc. and the Napolean Piece. Sweetness was perfect. Did not feel sooo rich that we were bloated. Just the perfect flavor and perfect amount of richness. Love the atmosphere.... Loved the store."}
{"text":"Sorry guys,  I went here after reading reviews and word of mouth.  Growing up in NYC and taking many a date to Little Italy and China Town.  I went in this morning looking to get some pastries and cookies for my morning JOE.  Well bought Napoleon, Cannoli's , Biscotti, and Sesame cookies.   The Napoleon must have been in the case for about a week (custard was all skinned over and like strings), Cannoli was horrible filling not very sweet and not very creamy, the shell was crispy, biscotti had no flavor and was like cardboard.  Sesame cookies were good, like old NY.   Not sure if I will ever go back. Still have bad after taste of stale Napoleon and Cannoli.  :O("}
{"text":"Great local Italian deli that is hidden in the back of an Italian grocery store. The food is very authentic and fresh. Also, the desserts are unreal, all kinds of pastries and Italian ice. If you like Italian food, cook with Italian ingredients, or are Italian yourself you need to come here!"}
{"text":"Just like home

I am originally from back east and it can be a real challenge to find a good Italian Delicatessen in Arizona. Unless you stop in at Romanelli's, this Delicatessen is the real deal.

I have stopped by Romanelli's a few times for lunch and I have never been disappointed. The aroma when I entered always brings back memories of back home. They even have small market, with hard to find delicacies.

Romanelli's has so many good things, sausages, meats, cheeses, sandwiches, pastries, cookies, cakes,  pasta, and meatballs,  just to name a few. If you're ever in the store you have to try Romanelli's bottled Marinara Sauce, it's absolutely delicious. It's the only bottled sauce you wont have to doctor up, its perfect right out of the jar. 

Romanelli's offers a hot and cold lunch counter with daily specials like chicken parmesan, sausage & pepper sandwiches, Itaian beef sandwich and so much more. My favorite is the Italian Stallion, loaded with imported meats, cheeses, and Italian dressing, the perfect sandwich and it's big enough for two. 

You can  'eat in' at small tables next to deli counter or get a great pinic lunch to go. The staff is wonderful at this family-owned restaurant, the prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious. If you're ever in the neighborhood you have to stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here, as my co-worker & I went here to pick up lunch to take back to the office after finishing up a graphics installation nearby at Grand Canyon University. From the outside, this place looks like a 60's-era thrift store-type building. You walk inside, and it's an actual Italian store, delicatessen, and eatery filled with all things Italian...from the food, to the clothing, knick-knacks, and souvenirs. 

I ordered spaghetti and a medium-sized soda and my co-worker ordered the George, which was a 10' sub with all kinds of lunchmeats, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, also vinegar and oil and oregano. It looked and smelled wonderful! He got it as a combo with chips and a large drink. 

When we went to pay at the register, my co-worker picked up a box of yummy Italian cookies of all types to take back to have for when we get \"sweet munchies\". All said and done, the lunch was about the price of your typical dinner entrees and dessert. Not too shabby. 

The ambience of this place was really wonderful and the owners were very, very friendly and hospitable. This is a \"Mom & Pop\" business and one I would gladly visit and buy meals and goods from over and over. The shop is located in a small strip mall at the intersection of Dunlap and 35th Avenue in Phoenix. 

I HIGHLY recommend this place when you are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The cheesecake scrum delicious 6lbs definitely a place to go for authentic Italian. Chicken parmigiano hero the marina sauce and all the mozzarella cheese enough to feed two"}
{"text":"This isn't gonna be a long review. Just straight to the point. Amazing food. I've gone through most of this menu and everything is so good. It's a little pricey, I'll give ya that. But as hold true with most in life. You get what ya pay for."}
{"text":"My uncle ordered one of their party subs for the Super Bowl. It was their italian sub, with capicolla, salami, ham, pepperoni, and provelone. It was FANTASTIC! I am a sucker for italian subs, but picky when it comes to the quality. This was perfect. I will definitely be going there myself to see what their other dishes tastes like."}
{"text":"Went back and picked up the best canolis I've ever had along with some delicious NY Cheesecake, Romanelli's pasta sauce, imported pasta, Wise potato chips and Italian cookies.  

It is now very clear to me that you absolutely cannot go wrong at this place.  I'm comfortable trying anything and everything there.  I would go every day if I could.  Great food, Italian grocery, deli, etc."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, amazing cannoli but the lady at the front where you get your cookies and pay isn't very friendly. Almost seems like she hates being there, oh well."}
{"text":"Ahhh, just what the doctor ordered. Today I was looking for a good Italian cold cut sandwich fix. I found it here with the 10\"super sub! 
If Romanelli's isn't Italian, I don't know what is.
I also grabbed a jar of Il Primo giardienera, slapped some of that goodness on my sub and I was good to go! The sub was big! Saved the other half for later.I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! Amazing pastries! Must try"}
{"text":"Visited Romanelli's today to pick up some San Marzano tomatoes which turned into a wonderful experience. It was around noon when I went so I figured I might as well get some lunch as well. I got the super sub sandwich and it had a good portion of meat and cheese on it. I believe it came with ham, pepperoni, salami, and cappicola and all of them had really great flavor. I also tried a cannoli which I really enjoyed. The cannoli shell had great texture and the filling was very creamy. My girlfriend wanted to try the limoncello mascarpone cake which was super moist and had a really great lemon flavor. As we were picking out which desserts to choose from, one of the workers was very nice and helpful and she also shared with us one of her recipes. The customer service alone is a good enough reason to make a visit here. They make you feel welcome and very comfortable and you can tell that they love what they do. Lastly, after we finished our meal another worker was handing out samples of their Italian sausage which was spicy and had really awesome flavor. I will most definitely be coming back for other great Italian treats."}
{"text":"I've heard about Romanelli's and driven by but yesterday I stopped in for lunch. I ordered the meatball sandwich and my husband ordered Italian beef. We did the combos so we chose pasta salad. The meatball sandwich was amazing! The bread was perfectly toasted and the meatballs were flavorful and solid. My husband loved his Italian beef. He's from Chicago so he's a snob about Italian beef. His favorite in the valley so far. We were so impressed that we ordered the take home meal from Romanelli's for dinner. The dinner serves 2-3 people.  You can choose from baked ziti, spaghetti,  chicken parm. There is another option but I can't recall what it is.  We chose the chicken parm. The meal comes with a salad,garlic bread & spaghetti w meatballs.  $24.99 is reasonable for dinner. Spaghetti, meatballs & salad was perfect. Chicken parm  wasn't that great. The chicken seemed too thick & their was no flavor in the breading or chicken.  Oh well, I just won't' order the chicken parm next time. If you want  authentic Italian beef, tasty meatball sandwich, need a cannoli or want a large jar of hot peppers, Romanelli's is your place. Next on my list, pizza & cold sub's..."}
{"text":"OMG! It tastes like Home! The Italian cookies, the Italian subs, the cannolis. Sooo good omg! Thank You for the Great Service. And Great food!"}
{"text":"Hand Down This Place is Amazing OMG the Food so fresh you feel like your in Italy there in person eat food like mama makes it cant get better then that .The imported meats amazing the imported olive Oil is to die foe do i need to say more . This is the place I can get Married In and have my cake too.."}
{"text":"This is a solid sandwich, and when I'm in the area I will swing by again if in the mood for a sub.  I am still on the hung for the amazing bread I miss so much when I lived in Santa Monica at \"Bay Cities Italian Deli\".  I was hopeful for Romanelli's after reading the reviews, but not even close.  \"Ike's For Love Of Sanwiches\" is pretty good, but still not the same as \"Bay Cities\" in Santa Monica.  If anyone knows of a deli with amazing rolls, please let me know!

Romanelli's has good meat and also \"Parma\" prosciutto, which can be hard to find in many delis.  They have a good selection of meats, cheeses, salads, and hot items.  They have both cold & hot subs available for purchase at pretty good prices.  My sub was $7 and it was huge; like 14\".  It fed me twice, and was even better after it sat and soaked up all the flavors for 2 or 3 hours.

Check it out if your in the area and are in the mood for a solid sub!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich, great grocery store, incredible desserts, friendly people, kinda rundown location."}
{"text":"10-inches of hard crust Italian bread stuffed with ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella (hold the pepperoni), provolone, hot peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing. Heaven. Great deal at only $7.95! Waaay to much sandwich for one person for lunch. 

They have a lovely pastry case filled with Italian cookies, cannoli shells (and cannoli, but I prefer to make my own filling - viva Sambuca and chocolate chips!) and sfogliatelle. 

Aisles and aisles of canned, jarred, boxed and bagged Italian pantry essentials (and they're not covered in dust like some other places). 

Keep an eye on the prices. Some are fair - Polly-O brand is hard to come by in the Valley but others are practical extortion! ($20 for Illy espresso!!?)"}
{"text":"Is this the best Italian Deli / Bakery that I've ever been to? No. Is this the best one in the Valley area? Absofrigginlutely!!! 

This is the ONLY place that I know of in this metro area that you can select from eight varieties/brands of San Marzano Tomatoes. If you have to ask why that is significant enough to merit 5 stars... then I can only imagine that you haven't spent decades attempting to perfect your Pomodoro or Pizza Sauce. 

Combine this with the fact that they almost always have Rainbow cookies available and some of the best fresh Italian breads, and you have achieved two-thirds of an almost idyllic Italian meal. 

Before you leave the store, make sure you take a leisurely stroll along the back wall. This is what I like to consider a little piece of heaven on earth. Every imaginable cheese / meat you've ever heard uttered by the Mario's, Lydia's, and Giada's of this world can be found in the case that runs the entire length of the store. Want to create an out of this world antipasto selection for your next get together? Seriously if you can't find it in that case, you are trying to live up to Captain Jack Harkness standards, and although I adore him... he is a work of fiction! 

And I have to agree with Nathan; they make one hell of a sandwich, but I've never sampled any of their other eat in/take out items, so my input is limited on that side of the house. 

This is not a \"pretty\" place. It's not trendy or new and it is located in yet another strip mall. But it is a fully functional, family run, local business that is operated by two of the nicest guys you would ever want to meet. As far as quality and friendliness goes, this place rocks! I discovered Romanelli's about 25 years ago (remember... it's not polite to ask a girl's age) and let's just say, they had me at ciao. : )"}
{"text":"Wow! The deli is amazing.  Plus you can shop for some great Italian groceries.  Highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh these sandwiches are out of this world delicious.  I'm ashamed that it took me so long to try this place.  It's not just the sandwiches that are good but the salads and desserts, too!  Everything, is delicious.  You can tell this place is the real deal because they make food like the love doing it.  My favorite sandwich is the proscuitto, yum!"}
{"text":"I was going to give them another visit before reviewing but eh.. I got time. 

The place is amazing if you are looking for grocery's, meats, cookies etc. It is an organized clutter of it all. 

We went for lunch, which was good, confusing, and a bit $ for what I got. . The meats, cheeses and bread were all good but not OMG good. They seemed a bit lacking in substance believe it or not. LOL 

I liked it, but I have not been back yet. HMM 

I will try again!"}
{"text":"are you joking? Where else can you get the best salami, ham, any cold cuts anywhere? I just moved here 6 months ago and have been searching for a place like this. Their meats are fantastic. I discovered this place after driving by it so many times. thought I'd take a chance. Location is awful. but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich in town by far!! Also lots of groceries to take home with you. Great people great place!"}
{"text":"The subs are huge!  2 adults can split them.  Roast beef sub with everything and Italian sub loaded were particularly good.  Add on a pound of butter cookies, pasta salad and poolside lunch was complete.  Staff behind the deli counter were super nice and efficient!"}
{"text":"Everything was very good did the catering order with sandwiches and salads I would definitely recommend them you definitely get what you pay for.  This is far above your standard sandwich plate quality."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to buy the most delicious Italian pastries. You have to try the homemade cookies. When im in the phoenix arra I always stop by  because it is just delicious. Everytime i go im never dissapointed. They import alot from Italia, so stock up on olive oil and other ingridients to cook at home a homemade Italian diner."}
{"text":"This place has one whole aisle for canned tomatoes & a half aisle for peppers of all sorts
Awesome deli. 
I purchased dry pastas, buffalo mozz., lg stuffed shells, meatballs canned San Marzano tomatoes (makes ALL the difference) & Tirimasu & eclair"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Italian market in Phoenix! They have anything you'd want from italian themed non-food items to an amazing selection of pastas, sauces, meats, cheeses, pastries, and breads.  I was craving some good italian food and this place did not dissapoint.  Amazing selection and very nice people."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch. Service was quick and friendly. Food was fairly good but nothing I'm rushing back for and, honestly, if I was in the area, I'd probably try somewhere different. 

I got eggplant and spaghetti. It needed more flavor but overall good. My husband got a sub but I honestly don't know which one. It's really hard to find a good sandwich in the PHX area. 

Fairly clean. Nothing fancy. Neighborhood is sketchy."}
{"text":"Ahh, this place is refreshing.  Smells like italy as soon as you walk in.. (ok, never been, but that's how it better smell).  We had lunch there, a chicago style italian beef and it was fantasic.  It's also a market, so, needless to say, I enjoy grabbing a quick bite in places that are a bit unconventional.. and, as I sat there eating, I looked at some italian antacids that kind of looked like screws or something that were bottled on the shelf next to me.. :/  Anyway, I also bought premade cannoli shells, which were a bit pricey, but to make my own it would have probably cost more..  AND they had the filling to purchase as well..  This was pretty neat to me.  Really though, this place has anything and everything you would need to make any italian dish, and the services was exceptional.."}
{"text":"Great little Italian deli. Famiky owned.  Great people who work there.  Awesome sandwichs, pasta salad,  meats, desserts.  Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Romanelli's is great. I've been going there for the last five years and it's never let me down. I always go with the Italian Stallion with fresh mozzarella and peppers. It's a family owned business and the service is great. Rob, the owner, always remembers my order. For anyone looking for a real Italian deli in Phoenix, Romanelli's is your place."}
{"text":"Been going here for the Italian sausage for over ten years, very good product. However, I am so tired of the owner and his smug son. The deli sandwich prices are way too expensive now. Th ey also don't have the good crispy bread they use to have. How can panera have better bread than an Italian place? I was there last week and noticed some ordered pretty bake pizzas, so I bought a couple and they were pretty bad. Their  warm lunches are good, however way too expensive. If ya need sausage foe the bbq I would go, if you want lunch take a pass."}
{"text":"THANK GOD there is a HIGH quality Italian deli nearby the house...Turns out that this deli is THE go to Italian deli in Phoenix, lucky me...Looking for hard to find Italian items, they are here, looking for amazing Tiramisu or Cannolis, they are here, looking for whole wheat Gnocchi, here....They have a great website that offers what product lines they carry, BIG help....and they have an awesome deli counter with WONDERFUL sandwiches and sides....LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I can't count the number of people I have told about Romanelli's, and they end up coming regularly from all parts of the Valley.  I live relatively close, and have been going to for over 30 years, since I moved from NYC.  Genuine NY-style Italian deli/suprette,  Friendly, enthusiastic employees provide great service, and their selection of cold cuts, cheeses, Italian groceries, breads, cookies and cakes can't be beat. From specialty subs like the \"Italian Stallion\" or \"Robert's Special\", hot meatball or chicken parm sandwiches, to one of the best hot pastrami sandwiches in Phoenix, this is the place to take your appetite!"}
{"text":"Hit this place up for a quick lunch.  I took my order to go.  The place was clean and bright.  It had a great small business deli/market feel.  Everyone was friendly.

I ordered the 10\" sub sandwich on white bread.  The bread was great, soft but substantial with great flavor.  The meats were quality and the provolone had great bite.  Seems hard to find a good flavorful provolone anymore, theirs was great and a nice thick slice.  They added a good balance of oil/vinegar, tomato, red onion, lettuce and oregano.  Great sandwich!

I couldn't get out if there without ordering a canoli.  I ordered the regular.  At $2.99, they aren't cheap but worth it.  The filling is made with a hefty dose of vanilla, which I love.  Just the right amount of chocolate chips.  The shell was crispy but not too thick and I could really taste the cinnamon.  

All in all, like the previous reviewer....\"this place is legit\".

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches roast beef and cheese was real delicious bread rolls were perfect only minus was too much oil and vinegar made  bottom of bread soggy"}
{"text":"The hubs and I would visit Mona Lisa Italian deli in San Diego's little Italy all the time when I lived across the street. We have not been able to find a sub if it's equal but Romanelli's gets pretty damn close. I'm pretty plain Jane as far as turkey and cheese but the dressing and the bread are key (and they have boars so the cold cuts are top notch) and neither disappointed. Picked up a jar our their own brand of marinara and very excited to try it. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Romanelli's baked a delicious Tiramisu cake for my sister's bridal shower.  It was beautiful and lined with lady fingers to cover sides. It was light with right balance of flavors.  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Absolutely rude! I don't care how the food taste when there's disrespectful employees it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and it really makes you regret spending your money there..."}
{"text":"Had exactly what I needed (Polly o mozzarella) Lots of it and then some... We also picked up some sandwiches and a pizza the sauce is amazing! They even have the little ones a cookie"}
{"text":"Romanelli's is by far the best Italian spot I've found. Their food is amazing and fresh while their selection in the grocery aisle can't be beat. The employees lend to a genuine family feel, and are always so happy to see you. And the dessert case -- mmm mm mmm.. doesn't get much better than that!
My only complaint would be their limited hours, but that's just because I wan't Romanelli's at all times of the day and night.

I've recommended Romanelli's to every person I possibly can. 10/10 would eat again... and again (and again)"}
{"text":"5 stars to Rob and his family! What do I usually get here?  My wife gets the lasagna,  I get a nice hero, maybe chicken cutlet,  or a nice prosciutto and provolonewoth peppers.  Come for St Joseph's day and the whole week you can get the best stuffed zeppoles!!! FORGETTABOUDIT!  The pastries are the bomb. And the family and staff are the best. You can get cooking utensils, small kitchenware you won't find anywhere else,  italoan tshirts, frozen stuff to take home, hard to find canned goods....everything Italian."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for Nationals and decided to come in to grab some lunch.  This popped up on yelp and it was close to the hotel.  It's an old school Italian Deli!!  We ordered ham/cheese sandwich and salami/cheese.  The bread was so soft and delicious.  The sandwich was made with just the right amount of lettuce, Onion and Italian dressing.  We were very satisfied with our meal would come back.  This beats Subway any day."}
{"text":"Best thing going in the Cortez Park area! It's clean, the people are kind, the food is delicious, and they have Gino's East pizza in the frozen food section!"}
{"text":"Someone wrote that Romanelli's has a c/c service charge. Nearly every time I go there (2 x a year because I live to far away), I always pay with a c/c. Never once have I seen an additional charge (though, as a small business, I wouldn't blame them, if they did). Now, on to my 5/9/15 visit. Indeed, things have seemed to go down hill some. The owner was there and was his usual self (business like, but courteous). But, the deli counter staff didn't seem as outgoing as my last visit, though not with the rudeness that another poster said. I ordered a 10\" (no where on the menu is a 14\" sub as mentioned by another poster) Mortedealla and Provolone sub, with everything on it (I had to repeat that 3x) to go (very good, but it could have used more vinaigrette/dressing). Also, I ordered 12 slices of Proscuitto di Parma (got 12 1/2 slices, smashed together, still very tasty though), A mild whole piece of Sopasada (got a Hot one instead), 4 Eclairs and a Chocolate Cannoli (both are to die for). Also, got the store bought Stella Dora Swiss Fudge Cookies and La Florentine Torrone candies (both as good as always)."}
{"text":"Oh my, Yelp worked again, my wife And I stopped in and first saw the wonderful looking canoli's and cookies at the front counter so we decided to split a 10\" sub George's special sub actually, so we could get a dessert.  The sub had so much meat and I'm talking best quality tasty meat that we didn't need any dessert, but we did manage to force down a piece of tiramisu mmmmmmm!!!!! Great choice---- I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I would rank the Robert's Special sandwich in the top 5 best sandwiches I've ever had.  This is a gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I haven't really found that great of a deli around here yet but me and a coworker have come here and thus far have been impressed. Their subs are tasty despite being a bit heavy on the bread side; and their chicken Parmesan is pretty good too. The service is quick and the speed at which they prepare the subs is lightning fast. The only downside is the prices, I mean they are not that cheap for their subs but if you get desert like cannoli then you're going to fork over an extra $3.00 per cannoli or $2.00 per cookie.. Oh well I will continue to come here and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"So lucky I live near by! We love everything from here. Lasagna, stuffed shells, sammiches, and the best cannoli and baklava."}
{"text":"I always go to Romanelli's when I need to buy fresh cheese. Definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for fresh food. I haven't been able to eat there but definitely will sometime, I'm sure their food is delicious."}
{"text":"Was only in AZ a few months, already missing the food, not the weather, finally had the idea to search online for Italian places, Really wanted some tri color cookies, sfogliatella, cannoli, dried salami and the sharpest hunk of provolone there is, Romanelli's came up in the search, was not too far, wanted to do some exploring of our new city that day as well, so off we went.

The place was so much more than I expected to find here. So much \"stuff:\" LOL, it's almost a caricature of a NY Deli it's so over the top with not just everything Italian but New York in general! Love this place! I could have spent $1000 without even trying. I wanted everything! 

Got my pastries, some bread, more pastries and cookies, some cold cuts, including my cheese and a sausage, onions, peppers hero for the road! The funnest part was the back and forth with the people and employees who all sounded like me! :-) Attitude and all! Go here, today, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely satisfied with my first time visit. The place is very unique, well kept, and they make good quality sandwiches. I got the turkey breast and cheese and it was delicious. My next visit I will ask for more lettuce and extra pickles. 
They only received 4 stars because the employees were not very friendly and they seemed very preoccupied with other things. With it being my first visit I was hoping for a Hello when walking in the door since the cash register is right there and for the lady making my sandwich to see my confused look and ask if it was my first time. Regardless, I will be back because they have great quality products."}
{"text":"If you don't eat at Romanellis YOU ARE CRAZY.  They put out a 8-10\" Sub that puts SUBWAY and other places TO SHAME with the amount and quality of ingredients they put in it.   OMG is their stuff good.  They've got a hot Italian lunch buffet (lasagna, fettucini, parmeasana, ... as well as the best grinders in town.  Their HOME MADE potato and macaroni salads are EXQUISITE.  If you are reading this, stop now!  Get in the car and get over to Romanellis!  OMG is it good.  EVERYONE I have ever TAKEN there is BLOWN AWAY by their sammies.  WTF are you waiting for, or eating at a fast food place?  Their prices might be $1 more than eating fast food but its FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, it is the closest to his mothers cooking that we have found. We had the sausage lasagna and chicken Parmesan, along with an assortment of their wonderful desserts, with the warm and friendly staff we always enjoy our meals."}
{"text":"When I was pregnant, I came here frequently for their meatball subs. I love their Italian cookies. The grocery section and deli have everything you need to make a fabulous Italian dinner for the family."}
{"text":"Da bomb. I had a pastrami sandwiche and my lady had the turkey. Both excellent with the homemade bread. Couldn't pass up a napolean and some cannolis"}
{"text":"My mom and I went in for lunch over the weekend and tried some new items. My mother had the meat balls and I tried the Cannoli. 

Bravo! Romanelli's sent my taste buds into a frenzy over the weekend! My mother makes a mean Cannoli but I had to admit Romanelli's outdid her. Also the meatballs yummo! Not quite as good as my mothers but extremely close! 

The short of it is if you like cannoli you will love Romanelli's! Do your taste buds a favor and enjoy one soon! 

FYI they offer catering as well. Ask for Robert he will take care of you. Fuggedaboudit!

On another note: Surd I, the I must be for Insane. They have the best authentic meats and cheese's. I have tried cannoli all over this city. I don't know what cannoli you have been eating, but you wont find better in this city! Check your taste buds."}
{"text":"Authentic, old style Italian deli. Not many left but this is the place! Will only buy my mozzarella from them where they make it fresh! Fresh baked bread, hand cured meats, desserts....can't beat Romanelli's!"}
{"text":"Finally, remember to make a stop here at Romanellis's Italian Deli and Bakery that has been here since I was kid growing up in the area.   Total authentic deli, bakery & grocery experience.  The lady that checked me out of the store even had a thick New York Italian accent and sweet as can be.  When I placed my order for a sub (10 inch), the gentleman was so nice, you can expect customer service with a personal touch.  The sub was made with the highest quality & freshest cuts of meat and produce.  No more Jersey Mike's or Subway, etc...for me.  The bakery counter was filled with fresh made cookies, cakes, sweets, etc.  The deli counter was filled with homemade salads, dishes and deli meats and cheeses.  Will definitely make this stop more often, especially since they have so many Italian ingredients/groceries."}
{"text":"Today must have been a bad day.  Went in to the store and it started like every other time we have been in the store.  Looked at the shirts, looked at the baked goods, then headed to the Deli Counter.  Saw a special on the glass.  any two different items 10.99.  I was not really interested in the meatball, lasangna, or Chicken Parm, just wanted some of their Italian Sausage.  So being it was 5:30 and they we closing in a few minutes I asked if I could get two of the sausages for the price of the special?  The very nice lady behind the counter said sure no problem.  So I began to    order for my wife son and I.  Ok I will have 2 specials,  My wife would like the Chicken Parm and the Meatballs, My son even though he is only 6 wanted the meatballs and the Lasanga, no worries I ordered the Meatballs and the Lasanga, and lastly I will have two Italian sausage.  at that point the not so pleasant fat, Short, guy from behind the counter yells they have to be two different things, then turns to the lady and states cant you read, how long have you worked here?  i began to explain and he yells again this time at me, If you want two sausages they are 6.99 a piece or you c an buy the at 5.49 a pound a take them home and cook them yourself.  I stated that if I wanted to cook dinner  I would not have come in.  he then yelled if you want us to cook them you can pay for them?  this was our cue to leave.  the poor girl behind the counter said she was sorry and he began to yell at her again.  As we got in our truck the girl came out and waved as she knew us from many past visits.  The food is ok at best however my wife being Italian liked the nostalgic feel of the place.  Now because of the rude behavior of the little fat man we will not be returning,  After 15 years we will buy our Italian Sausage elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and son LOVED their sandwich, and that's saying a lot!!! I for one, couldn't stop licking the wrapper that the Lemoncello Marscopone cheesecake was sitting on. Hands down one of the best desserts I've ever had! Nice sized italian grocery store, fabulous meat and cheese selection, and the staff was so friendly. I'll be picking up that cake for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Cannoli's. People, if you even THINK you know what a good cannoli tastes like, then you are sorely mistaken. Romanelli's hands down has the best cannoli's I've ever had. 
Ridiculous! 

The people who work here are so extremely friendly. I dropped in yesterday at 10 minutes til closing and I wasn't rushed at all. I ordered 2 sandwiches, a pound of the macaroni salad and made my way to the register. 

I noticed they were all out of cannoli's but the lady behind the counter had 2 made up for me, THAT's customer service! 

If you ever find yourself over by Metro Center and want a sub or even some baked zitti or lasagna go give them a whirl!"}
{"text":"This is the best deli I've been to in Phoenix. The customer service was great and the staff let me know their most popular subs. The food was superb and the meat was absolutely amazing.  I highly recommend this deli. Will definitely be going more often."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and will definitely be going back!!! This is real authentic italian! Absolutely delicious sandwich!  The cannoli is also out of this world! This place is a diamond in the rough as its not located in the best area. Its also a mini store, selling other items. Don't expect to eat in with a super large group as there may not be enough tables but you can order to go and I also read that they cater. If you are looking for one of the best italian sandwiches, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Stopped by and picked up a hot pastrami 
Sandwich, cold pasta salad and a lemonade. The pastrami sandwich was great! The meat was soft and tender with good flavor. Cold pasta salad was good nothing special. Lemonade out of a regular soda machine. The place looks like a good old family owned restaurant. They have Italian merchandise all over the place."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Romanelli's for some time now. Have tried many items in their deli and bakery and each time it has been wonderful. Have had a few items from their hot food area, but it's not as good as the fresh made sandwiches. Their canolli's are fresh made and very yummy. The service is always great and the people are quite nice. Family owned and operated as well.
Today I had capocolla on wheat with their deli mustard. Spicy! Also had a conolli to go with it. All in all, a very good lunch."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of weeks ago when I was in the area shopping for a new Bento box. I picked up some subs for dinner, along with a few items I haven't had since I've moved out here from New York. 

I got the italian beef special, and the boy got some sort of italian meat masterpiece. Mine was delicious, and he seemed to really enjoy his. I also got a bag of wise potato chips since I haven't had them in FOREVER. YUM. (I also got an assortment of italian cookies, because seriously, who doesn't need some delicious rainbow cookies in their life?)

Overall, this place is awesome. The men behind the register were hilarrrrious. The woman behind the cookie counter was really helpful, but totally evil because she was steering me towards all sorts of delcious goodies that I shouldn't be eating.

I will definitely be going here again when I get a craving for some New York subs. Mmm."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian Beef I have ever tasted. I have lived in my Condo for 5 years and married for 4. Never knew this place existed until my Brother in Law was introduced by his GF to Romanelli's and told us but we waited for almost a year.  Shame on us. But rest assured this will be our go to sandwich place."}
{"text":"There was nothing about this place I didn't like. I just ate the hot NY pastrami with the spicy mustard and provolone cheese and it was amazing! The meat is so flavorful and goes perfect with the spicy mustard. We got two cannolis and an order of baklava both were very good. I'm glad I found this place! Also everyone there is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Brooklyn, New York and I am Italian, when I first found this place many years ago, I was so very happy-I love the owners, products, best place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Kathy Pellegrino"}
{"text":"Old school deli that has amazing food.  Chicken parm and lasagna are my favorites.  You cannot go wrong with either or both.  The tiramisu and cannoli's are perfect.  Great spot or Italian sausage to make at home too."}
{"text":"A nice selection of Italian groceries. They make a great deli sandwich with boar's head meats and fresh Italian bread. The cannoli is always good but I had a napoleon once I didn't like. The pasty and custard were too dry, not fresh. Lots of cookies and other goodies to tempt you."}
{"text":"Love this place. Generous portions and great service. My boyfriend and I can split a sandwich and a pickle, were stuffed. The New Yorker or meatball is the way to go, although I've never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Love, Love this place. I've been going for years and noticed I never reviewed it. You can't go wrong with the sandwiches they are divine. My favorite is the George's Special - cured Italian meats and peppers. I always get the hard crust bread which is great with the oil dressing, bread gets soft not soggy. I've had several of their sandwiches and they are all amazing. The meatball sub is out of this world. I do wish they had a better selection of cold salads, but eh they are still better than anything you would get at a traditional grocery store. The napoleons are also amazing. Lots of custard."}
{"text":"Gruff italian deli/bakery/market/bodega extraordinaire. Had heard of it's reputation via Yelp and swung in when I passed it on Dunlap. To be honest, I just went for the cannoli. Staff suggested the baked ziti or the chicken parmesan, but they were out of both (granted, it was ten minutes til close). 

Deli looked well stocked and downright delicious, but my eyes were on the prize... they filled 6 cannoli as I wandered the aisles, checking out their pasta selection (actually not too impressive). I asked for a bag of ice to keep them cool as I live an hour away and the kid brought a ten-pound bag of ice, the kind you buy for your beer cooler. 

The manager said, \"Did you charge her for that?\" Well, I didn't actually need a BAG of ICE, I wanted the cannoli to keep cool. Offered up my credit card as a peace offering and he shook his head, kinda disgusted and shooed me out with a \"just take it and go.\" I felt guilty, but hey, if you don't get my drift and charge me $2.00 for a bag of beverage ice then expect cash... I brought in $2 in change that I scrounged for in my car and he seemed surprised.

Cannoli were good, authentic, but the shell was a little thick for my taste. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll stop by again, perhaps hit up the deli. Word of advice: spell out what you want and maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't. And maybe you'll have to pay extra :)"}
{"text":"Went in to buy a Panettone bread. Smells amazing, I'd like to try some food next time I go in. Someone was leaving with tray after tray for some huge party - Wish I had been invited! :)  They sell cannoli shells and now I'm thinking I should try making my own soon"}
{"text":"Used to love Romanelli's for their old world authenticity.  I wish they could merge the worlds a bit more and update their check out system.  If you pay by credit card they charge $1.50 on top of their pretty pricey items.  For a sandwich, drink and bag of chips to be $15.00 out the door - way too much.  The deli sandwich maker consistently forgets to put items on my subs.  I have to check two or three times to make sure every item I ask for gets on there.  This makes my sandwhich wrapping a mess!!!  I love their no frill Tuna Salad yet they don't always have it, you have to call ahead and make sure they are serving it that day, which makes spontaneous stopping by too premeditated for me.  Not a lot of great Delis in the North Vally area, i wish this one could have stayed as good as it has been for such a long time :("}
{"text":"Their meatball sub on their bread is a bite of heaven. I never have room for their cannoli's but I always take a few home.  they are amazing.   Take the time to wonder around the grocery. It is worth the time."}
{"text":"I used to like this place until I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich....never go back. The eggplant parm was thin dry and burnt and should have never been served."}
{"text":"12/19

Delightful folks!  I wanted something special for Christmas Eve and with the help of Beth, I will have my special treat in time, in Prescott Valley.  When I go down to Phoenix, I'll be stopping in to Romanelli's, to do some shopping and say Hello.  I am so pleased!!
Merry Christmas Romanelli's!!!!  PJS"}
{"text":"Want the best pastrami sandwich of a life time?!? Want garlic bread that could be the main course!!!?? Want a HUGE variety of sandwiches and pastas and cheeses and olives and desserts to choose from?!?! Romanelli's is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Any sandwich that I have had is fresh. I have been coming here for over 9 years. Besides food they are a small mom and pop grocery store, that carries imported items from Italy and some Greek food too. Best Italian place in phx"}
{"text":"This place is addictive,The best Romano an fresh parmesan ever,gotta try the pachetto sub."}
{"text":"Omg.   The subs here are money.   I love this place   We stumbled upon it one afternoon and it's now one of our favorites"}
{"text":"OMG! Went here for our annual Christmas purchase of obscene quantities of Italian cookies. Decided to have lunch while there with the family. 3 had the lasagne, one had italian beef sandwich and the other a cold cut sandwich. All of these were amazing! The folks that work there are the best. I really cannot say enough about the place. This is a cooks paradise with a wide ranging assortment of ingredients for the discriminating cook. They also have the real Spumoni!! Hard to find!  Go here. You will love it!"}
{"text":"This place beyond rocks! I came in Saturday morning looking to got some things to make Italian Muffalalettas  for a Sunday tailgate. Robert Romanelli put everything together for me in about 25 minutes!!! Fresh bread, freshly sliced meats and cheeses, and he even recommended sides I even left with mini cannoli and Italian cookies. One of the best gourmet store shopping experiences I have ever had. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good Italian Sub. They didn't get 5 stars from me because the meatball sub had the blandist sauce I've ever tasted. it for that reason lacks any flavor. I added some salt so I could eat it since it cost $9.00 but I would  not order it again. Their desserts are really good. my favorites are the Cheesecake and the Rainbow Cookies.  We pick some up on weekends as a nice little treat."}
{"text":"This place has awesome Italian butter cookies per the pound- I have not been able to find these in years, especially since moving to AZ. Love this place for that item alone. 

I think the food is so so, really nothing to be desired, BUT the cookies keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I just ADORE this deli!  I always go on Saturdays  (because they are closed on Sundays)

I forgot the lady's name up front. .. she is married into the family. .. anyway,  she's just a doll and so lovely to be around! Its like she's that favorite aunt of yours that always sneaks you cookies and a sip of wine.  

Their meats and so so fresh and delightfully amazing! The pork, veal and beef meatballs are heavenly!  Best Italian deli around, I assure you!"}
{"text":"Fabulous sandwiches! We had 6 different types of sandwiches and they were ALL delicious! And the cannoli was the best I've had since we were in Italy!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! I'm a NYC Italian and I was really missing real authentic Italian food. I really thought I could not find any authentic Italian anything anywhere in Arizona and I was really disappointed. Then I heard about this lovely place. They make REAL meatballs and REAL sauce. Buy the jarred sauce and buy the meatballs. You won't be disappointed.  The sauce tastes like my grandma's sauce, and that's saying a lot. The cannolis are also excellent. They use the REAL ricotta cheese that you can only find back east - Polly-O brand Ricotta Cheese. I asked the owner about it and she said they have the cheese special-ordered and shipped out so they can make the cannolis right. And I'm SO glad they do! This store has a lot of specialty Italian items that you can't find anywhere else, except maybe in Italy. 

You can also order from the deli area and they have a great selection of hot and cold items and some table and chairs where you can get a quick bite. The sandwiches are as close to NY style as I could find."}
{"text":"Instead of going to Italian Fest in Scottsdale we are having our own at home on Sunday with the family. Got lots of cheese (incl a nice round of smoked provolone)and sausage and prosciutto, a large bucket of frozen Italian beef, rolls and bread, jardiniere etc. I also stocked up on san marzano tomatoes, got two sandwiches, olives and mozz n tomato salad from the deli...delicious. Don't forget the cannolis! very helpful employees...fun place!"}
{"text":"Right from the first few seconds I opened the door to Romanelli's, I felt like I was in a fairy dreamland.  I was immediately greeted by a beautiful display case of Italian cookies, which we (my husband and I) later went back and bought a pound of.  Then we followed our noses to the deli counter, where they had both hot food already prepared, as well as a menu of deli sandwiches. We decided to shop around a little bit first, since I wanted to buy a few items. We took our time wandering around the store, and after about 10 minutes on of the owners, Robert, came over to us to make sure we were okay. He then proceeded to take us around the store pointing out all the best ingredients and what I was looking for.  It was a delight! I stocked up on the basics like EVOO, balsamic vinegar, pasta, and bought my first can of San Marzanos. It was after the canned tomato aisle that my heart stopped. I literally turned around and almost peed my pants. I almost pee my pants just thinking about it. I spotted the pastry case, and contained within was a HUGE eclair that made my heart do a little flutter. So of course I HAD to get an eclair....and a cannoli and baklava. This was my first cannoli and will most definitely not be my last. YUM!!!!!!!

We then went back to the deli counter and ordered lunch. I had the Italian Stallion and my husband had the sausage and pepper sub. He was so impressed, that we ordered 2 links of sausage to take home with us! 

Overall, this being my first time in an Italian deli and grocery, it was more of an experience than anything. The people were so friendly and helpful to the blonde girl from Phoenix. I clearly didn't know what I was doing but they have so much passion for their food and what they do, that they took the time to help educate me on Italian cooking and all the pleasure it brings. Even though it takes about 20 minutes to get here from my house, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"If I were Italian I think I would come here every day.  Better yet I'd pitch a tent right in the middle of the store and live here.  What an amazing italian grocery/ deli/ bakery this place is for Phoenix.

I was hoping to come here just to try a sandwich and had to leave with a few other items.  I bought an antipasta salad for later and upon checking out there was this little old lady behind a dessert counter with chocolate cannoli's staring right at me.  Of course I couldn't resist!

The location isn't in the nicest area, but it's definitely worth hopping off I-17 to enjoy some Italian scenery and food.  The staff took me back to the time when I was in NYC walking in Little Italy during the San Gennaro festival.   That's culture at its greatest, but this was somewhat similar in many ways."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review.  We drove about an hour to get some St. Joseph day pastries.  They were very good.  They had two kinds 1) with custard filling and 2) with ricotta cream filling.  We also  had lunch.  The meatball hero was amazing plus the turkey, roast beef and cheese hero was stacked high with ingredients and reminded me of being back east.  The grocery store has some amazing Italian pastas, drinks from back east and other amazing stuff to make a great Italian dinner at home.  The pastries were very good, I did not like the cake frosting on the chocolate eclair but the custard was very good not to sweet and the napoleon tasted very good as well.  The cookies I thought were a little over price @ $11.00 a pound and you only get about 6-8 cookies for that price.  I say this is a mixed review because I tried the baked ziti also and it was very very dry, tasted like it was a day old and the pasta sauce was very very acidic.  It actually made me throw up.  I originally wanted to try their pasta because I was looking to have them cater an event but after trying the very dry pasta which made me throw up I decided to use another restaurant.  The sandwiches and pasties are amazing. Customer services rocks. I would not go out of my way to go here but if I was in the neighborhood I would stop in just for the sandwiches and a yoohoo."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sandwich shop!  Everything is fresh, made to order. Sandwiches are amazing, pasta is amazing, pastries are amazing, people are amazing. Wish they were open later, I'd eat here way more often!!! 

My go to is the Italian stallion!"}
{"text":"Just by walking into Romanelli's I knew I was going to enjoy my lunch. The fresh baked goods smells fill up the deli and it is amazing. I had the #7 Italian Stallion - DELICIOUS! The bread was baked to perfection. The meats were cut fresh from the deli display and you could tell. I would high recommend Romanelli's to anyone that is looking for an authentic italian sandwich. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back!  The food is sooooooo good. I like that this place is as authentic as you can get!  It's a hidden gem.....can't believe I never knew about it. I"}
{"text":"I love this place live almost right next door and go there all the time for lunch i give this place five stars and its some of the best Italian food i have eaten."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Authentic New York and Italy style. Cannoli were amazing. Everything is homemade, old world recipes. Chicken Parmesan sandwhich was delicious. The New Yorker sandwhich was very good, I Sfogliatelle is better than in Florence. The owner is a very welcoming person, make sure to talk to him. The market has everything Italian you could imagine."}
{"text":"I came here to grab a quick dinner and some desserts. 

The coconut macaroons are amazing. My dad loved the eclair that I got him. 

We also grabbed some sandwhiches which were delicious. 

I'll be back to grab some pasta sauce and other items from the market. 

Four stars because I felt the prices were a bit exorbitant."}
{"text":"To start: this is not the place to go if you are looking for a Subway or Blimpie sandwich, so if that is your idea of what is \"good\" you won't like the experience here.  Good sandwiches (try the George's special which is the Italian Stallion referenced by others plus a couple other meats including mortadella and hot peppers) or the pastrami that they get shipped direct from New York.  They have their own off site bakery, so try some of their breads (the ciabatta is especially good) or cookies: the butter cookies are a bit hit or miss, but the rainbow cookies that they keep in the back are nearly to eastern standards.  However, the real star of the show is the sausage that they grind daily, along with the selection of certain specialty items: 30 year old balsamic, San Marzano tomatos and Mancini peppers anyone?"}
{"text":"I have been away from NYC since 1996 and have never been here before. What a blast from the past a real Italian Deli. I had the George's hero it was outstanding. I felt I was back in the Bronx. The smell once I entered the deli was unbelievable.  They say smell is one of the strongest senses we have that bring back memories.  Not only was it a deli but a store that you can buy Real Italian products. Then to top it off the store has a bakery. Then the best was Frankie singing our favorite hits. Doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"As an Italian that moved to Phoenix, this is the closest thing to home I have and they have amazing options to make this person content. Also, nothing better than their cannolis."}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on for years and usually get treated okay,  but today it was different. I go in after having a stressful day at work all morning and day to get there by 3:15pm to purchase and eat my first meal of the day to have this what I feel was a ignorant,  prejudice, hateful old  man with glasses on was making my sandwich and he kept abruptly, rudely dismissing me and what I was saying I wanted on my sandwich and I found that to be embarrassing and rude. The people standing around me were uncomfortable with the whole approach as well,  so I calmly stood there thinking to myself, I deserve better treatment than what I am receiving and I feel that I am not being treated as the loyal valued customer as I should be. So then another worker that usually is there most of the time when I have ordered my food comes walking up and so I was assured everything was going to be okay by this point after my salutation to him and he dismissed and ignored me as well in front of all the customers that were standing around me and started taking their orders as he antagonized me in the process in how his coworker was mistreating me. I took it as if he thought it was funny to play with my fuckin food.  Well now you know Romanellis that I do do not play when it comes to fair, good, and acceptable treatment to a customer that has done nothing but up sale your company with compliments and how good your food is.  The arrogance that I have been receiving lately when coming in there has made me feel uncomfortable and now my blood pressure is high because my food was not satisfied and this is why I walked out on you after seeing the condescending prick was getting negative attitudes with me when in fact now I will and now have an attitude with Romanellis and the entire environment and staff. I am already spreading the word by mouth how you guys treated me today and will never come in there again and I have let three people know already and they said they will not go in there anymore.  Learn how to treat people especially the loyal customers that has done nothing but show you loyalty and love.  I can't stand this fuckin place now.  That was and is the last button of mine to push. I will not allow anyone or an arrogant business, person, or group ever mistreat and make me feel unworthy again. No more Romanellis for me, oh I forget thats what they wanted in the first place in mistreating me. So no loss right??  What a fuckin joke."}
{"text":"If you want a nice sandwich this is a decent sandwich deli. The hot food on the cart out front looks disgusting. Does it really need to be in the aisle? At least let me pretend it seems fresher and hide it behind the counter. They have a lot stuff in the shelves but i never see to much go out the door. The cannoli and other pasty in the case have always satisfied but no chocolate dipped cannoli when i really wanted one. Had to do with a standard one but they always please either way. With a few dollars and an overhaul they could make some more $$. But is kinda grubby and the staff is okay.  Try to get the soda in my cup and less than 3/4 icet. Parking is terrible. Do yourself a favor get yourself a cold sub to go and skip the ambience."}
{"text":"Sam and his brood treat customers like they are one of the family here.  I look forward to visiting Romanelli's whenever I'm in the neighborhood. 
 This place is a gem and a real taste of authentic old school Italian.  The cannoli was the best I've ever eaten.  The homemade sausage was absolutely fantastic as well.  I couldn't be happier to have this spot nearby, since my Italian mother doesn't live close enough to cook for me anymore."}
{"text":"I drive past this place everyday and have never gone before today, i went for lunch and oh my goodness! Best sandwich i think i have ever had! Had the newyorker sandwich which is a double stuffed pastrami sandwich and the the robert special which was pastrami,provolone cheese,  roast beef, mayo and other things i forgot, it was $10.99 for the newyorker but they are so big i only ate half! (so half for lunch tomorrow and when you think subway sells a shit sandwich for around $8 it doesnt even compare). De falcos is a similar concept in scottsdale which is good but this place is way better. They have a full market of imported italian products and a pastry stand too selling fresh italian pastries cookies and bread. I had a homemade cannolis and italian and it was delicious not too sweet. There was a super cute Italian man handing out samples of his hand made italian sausage which they also sell there. 100% will not be just driving past anymore!"}
{"text":"Authenticity = 5 stars
Quality & Service = 5 stars
Food = 4 stars 

Listen, their food is fantastic I just happen to be a bit of a purist when it comes to reviews on yelp.  Only the best sub sandwiches in the world get five stars, everybody else gets four if they're really great.  I suggest trying their Italian Stallion and for desert the cheesecake.  Local tip... don't skip the oil and vinegar or ghiardineria on your sandwich."}
{"text":"The best family owned Italian Deli. Been around over 30 years. The family are wonderful, the ambiance is amazing. Love the homemade food,bakery and everything. Everyone will love this place"}
{"text":"I recently moved in the area and was looking for a good sub shop. This place is amazing! True authentic Italian deli. Since it was my first time there, I had asked the nice lady if she had any recommendations. I had one of specials with hot peppers and it was way better than any sub shop I have been to. I will always try to support the mom and pop shop, but with subs like these, there is no surprise they have been for over 30 years. This place will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Italian deli's in Phoenix. They have an amazing selection of Italian groceries and their wine selection isn't bad either. The reason that you really want to come here is for the food that they make though, their lunch is amazing and they have a variety of sandwiches and hot dishes available. The chicken parm is my favorite and all of their sandwiches are also delicious. Also on your way out try one of their desserts, they can get pricey but are well worth it."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place. We just moved around the corner and were so excited to try it. I ordered two of the Italian Stallion sandwiches and brought them home. The bread was inedible. It was literally rock hard in some spots. This was unbelievably disappointing. The guy making them had to realize how stale the bread was, right???? I noticed he pulled it out of an open bag just sitting there but I didn't think it would be that bad. So upsetting, we won't return"}
{"text":"Live close to this place and have driven past it a lot. A friend and I went in after another place was closed. This place is great. They have a lot of pastas, sauces, olives, desserts, etc that you can buy. The deli has some great selections as well. We went in for lunch and we both got the four cheese lasagna! It was amazing! The sauce was delicious and the ricotta so creamy. The portion size was huge and we got garlic bread that they made (also fantastic)!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is yelping about the deli stuff. Okay, it's a deli and bakery - I get it. BUT what you gotta come here for is San Marzano tomatoes. Not those SM-like/style tomatoes that are actually grown in USA (yes they have those too) but the real deal, grown near the base of Mt. Vesuvius. Look for the DOP stamp (its like a region-control stamp on French wines).

Oh yeah, pick up some imported pasta in shapes you've never seen or some pizza dough and fresh basil (it's in the deli case by the meats) and make your own sauce. BAM!

Don't forget the Torrone (nougat candy) or some Italian Ice/Spumoni for dessert if you aren't a big pastry fan."}
{"text":"Moving to the area and saw this place from the road and immediately pulled in. They love Italy and sell some ridiculous souvenirs and kitschy stuff displaying that pride with a sense of humor. Also they have some of the best selection of Italians groceries I've seen in the valley. We got subs and a cannoli and were not let down at all. This place has the small town corner store feel with the great variety and high quality products that you expect to find in big box stores. If the food and ambiance doesn't get you, the super friendly staff will. These guys know their stuff, can hold a conversation and seem to really enjoy their jobs and helping customers. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed that this place is in Phoenix. It carries rare and hard to find products from Italy as well as in-house made Italian products. House sausages are insane, the deli is truly supherb. Feels like a slice of New York in the desert."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great selection of italian groceries. I need to add more so yelp will make this a post but i said everything i needed to say. What's wrong with short and sweet?"}
{"text":"I have been all over the world trying all sorts of food. Romanelli's lives up to the quality they boast about. Delicious food! Half way through the menu and I have yet to find a problem. Love the food and the small town atmosphere of the grocery store!"}
{"text":"We walked into Romanelli's just as it was closing, but the service there was outstanding. We eyed the pastries and ordered a lobster claw, chocolate eclair, and a cannoli. The staff assured me it was no problem if I wanted to order more cannoli's, it was no trouble at all to go and make more. I declined on their offer, but appreciated the gesture! We couldn't wait to go home to eat them, so we went into the parking lot and scarfed down our delights. I bit into the lobster claw - a perfect mixture of custard and flaky buttery pastry. Check Romanelli's out, it's been there for decades, and it's no wonder why, their food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Romanelli's!! The people who work there are great and the food is GREAT. What more do you want??? NOTHING. Perfect Italian deli. Buy dessert, buy sandwiches, buy sides, buy meat, buy pasta sauce. I've never been disappointed....besides when they are closed."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and this won't be our last!  Best, I mean best cannolis I've ever tried. I've tried many from all over the US and I can say theirs is so good! Their hot pastrami sandwich hit the spot with crusted Italian bread. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Neighborhood market and deli, family owned and operated, super friendly and outgoing. 

Food: I got the lasagna lunch combo, that came with garlic bread. The sauce was good in taste, but was served cold. The bakery items are delicious, butter cookies are too die for."}
{"text":"This review maybe a little impartial and maybe a little miss placed. Mainly because I only had one item from here. The cannolis but I will say they are amazing. They certainly made me wanna come back and try there other items."}
{"text":"Best meat subs. Everything is fresh and authentic I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Loved this place the first time we went several weeks ago and decided to go back yesterday for more. I very much enjoyed the grilled sub special on wheat. My friend opted for the chicken parm sub on Italian bread and after eating more than half I noticed the bread was moldy on the final 2\" of the sub as he was about to take another bite. An anomaly I am sure. Needless to say we were shocked. We had ordered out and didn't have time to return the sub, unfortunately, but I think it is safe to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just west of the I-17/Dunlap Rd exit, this place is a slice of Italy in the desert.  At least it's a slice of Little Italy.  Fresh bread and deli meats, including pastrami flown in from New York City, salads, and a wide array of Italian specialties await.  You can grab a bite or do your grocery shopping.  They have unique olive oils and balsamic vinegar, frozen and fresh pasta/sauce, and a deep selection of other Italian foods.

I stopped in for lunch.  The small dining area was pretty full of business men and women, along with some regulars, including an exceptionally sweet woman who shared with me her love of a daily Italian Beef sandwich and Mass.  Her sandwich, and fresh lobster salad on the side, looked delicious. 

I had a hot pastrami on rye with cole slaw, Boar's Head cheese, and dressing.  It was very good.  I would definitely go back --- hopefully with cooler for groceries next time -- and recommend it as a solid lunch place if you in the area."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.

Meatball sandwich week?  I was craving another one today and decided to head down to Romanelli's.  It's only a few exits down the road from work and the reviews seemed pretty good!  I walked in and placed my order for a Meatball Sandwich.  (The going rate for a meatball sandwich in Phoenix is about $9.00-10.00).  Total was just under $10.00.  I paid my ticket at the register in the front of the store and then grabbed my sandwich. Here is how it was.........

Meatball Sandwich-  This was excellent!  They take a loaf of home made bread, slice it up right then and there, pile it with about 6-8 meatballs halves, top it with cheese and then pop it in the toaster oven!  The end product was great!  The bread was toasty, yet soft when you bit into it.  The meatballs had great texture and consistency, the cheese was melted perfectly, and the sauce/gravy they use is awesome!  It was a thicker sauce and was flavored perfect...not too sweet, and not bitter either. Overall, just a damn fine meatball sandwich!  Might be the best one I have had so far in Phoenix!

Overall, I was impressed!  The place is family owned and they have been open for over 40 years.  They have a deli counter as well as a whole little store with all sorts of Italian goodies (Sauces, bread, peppers, olives, cookies, etc). They have plenty of seating, too!  I will definitely be back to have another meatball sandwich and try out some of their cold subs as well.   Service was very friendly and while I was there, it seemed like lifelong, repeat customers kept coming in to grab something to eat.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I lived in the shit hole apartments next door over fifteen years ago. The only reason I lived there as long as I did was romanellies. I would walk next door and get cheap good sandwiches. I have been coming back through the years but seam to forget about it every few years. Then I was driving by yesterday and stopped in.  I have a obsession with pastrami and they did not disappoint. Told the guy to make me a BADASS pastrami sandwich on rye and oh he did work. Fuggedabouit"}
{"text":"Great true Italian deli! Everything from meats to cheeses, a fully stocked sandwich counter with both hot and cold selections and even pizza! Full Italian grocer as well and don't forget to grab a cannoli or two on your way out! I go here at least once a week now for lunch!"}
{"text":"This deli is the best I have had in the valley.We live in Chandler and have to drive 70mi round trip so it must be and we have tried many throughout the valley but none are as good. I will suggest the Italian stallion, it is awesome and huge as well. We enjoy this deli so much we are talking about taking a trip out there next Friday for lunch.We have visited half dozen times and have had only one issue with this nice little deli. The problem was not that big of a issue but did kind of tick me off. I had bought dinner rolls and when I got home pulled them out of the sack and they where hard as a rock.So always check for freshness before you buy anything from the bakery.There was one other little issue I had here when a gal working the front checkout counter was not pleased she had to work because she was not vary friendly at all and looked totally miserable.That was the only time I have seen her and hope I never do again, the main reason they did not get five stars from me. Other that that this place absolutely rocks dudes and is most definitely worth the 70mi trip."}
{"text":"Maybe in the early 80's this was the coolest shnitzel in the 'hood, but now it's just plain spaghetto.

Really not impressed at all.

Tiny portions.  Mediocre quality, at best.  

Too much bread($) for not enough meat(meat).

This place is riding on its reputation, but where it got its rep, i'm not sure.

If you're a fan, then hey, more for you.  

I'm not coming back unless someone makes me an offer i can't refuse."}
{"text":"Sorry I just made this account even though I told the person working the deli I would leave a review the next day, it's been 3 months. Well I remember how it tasted. Amazing if you ask me. Four and a half stars if it existed. I would give five if it was a sole eatery so the atmosphere is split. Go here if you want some Italian goods and a fresh tasting sandwhich."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm mmm!!! So good! This is the kind of old-school, real deal, Italian deli counter that I dream about. I had the lunch combo. 1/2 sandwich and salad. I choose cappicola and provolone and sundried tomatoe salad. It was legit. I ate there for lunch today and already want to go back. The service was great. Everyone there was supper friendlyband makes you feel like family. 
Your a true gem in the valley. Thank you for doing what you do!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how rude and sexist the owner and his son are.  As a female I am personally offended by this place."}
{"text":"On the day I went here for lunch with a colleague, I talked about how sick of the city I was during the drive over.  Then we walked into this place at a strip mall and it felt like I was transported to a small town grocery store that could have been in my rural hometown back east or even in Italy.  The family establishment vibe permeated the entire trip.  The service was very friendly.  And the food is amazing.  I could eat lunch here every day. It is very difficult to choose what to order because it all looks so good.  I had the sandwich special of the day, and it was fabulous. My colleague shared her potato salad with me and It was the best I've ever had.  I would like to go back and shop for deli meat and sausages. 

When we checked out, an older gentleman in front of us was moved to sing a song in Italian to the clerk after commenting on how the store reminded him of his youth. 
My colleague got a bunch of cookies and treats to go.  They were consumed rapidly by our office mates upon our return."}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Goodyear to visit this family owned business to get freshly made cannoli and Italian cookies. We chatted with the owner who has been here since 1982 and decided to stay for a pastrami sandwich. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Only 3 stars cause they have done away with their lunch combosnow everything is a la carte, chasing $$, will lose customers so sad. Keep the combos, just raise the price if you must, we can all understand that.
It will be a long time before we return."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!!!!
Sandwiches, pasta, salads, cheeses, meats ...
You name it, this guys are superb!!!
I keep coming back for more!!
Pay them a visit, you need to indulge!!!

S. Cárdenas."}
{"text":"Yasss!!! Love that it's a family owned and loved the atmosphere inside. Sub was great!!! I will be returning, their cookies you buy on the pound. They had cheesecake I was drooling over.  They have a large selection of food from subs to pasta and and is worth every penny. Don't let the area change your mind."}
{"text":"I continue to love and frequent this local, family owned business. The sandwiches are outstanding, customer service stellar and pastries amazing."}
{"text":"Drove from Surprise to get here.  We weren't disappointed!  Great Italian food - huge deli department.  Wonderful breads and pasteries.  Mouthwatering treats.  We'll be Back!!"}
