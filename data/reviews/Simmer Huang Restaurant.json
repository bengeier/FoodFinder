{"text":"Very expensive for what it is. Side dishes are even more ridiculously priced. The standard sauce we tried was very salty and only good for the first few bites. If you are craving something similar I would suggest going to Joon's for their table top cooking for a quarter of the price. 

The only bright spot is the good service provided by the wait staff, hence the only star i can give is for them and not for anything else related to restaurant."}
{"text":"Price - very pricey since it was $45 for the chicken pot...veggies were ordered separately but it cost $7 for assorted vegetables and $4 for the bean curd. Ended up spending $70 for two people.

Taste - VERY mediocre, below average. The flavour is not outstanding at all and to be honest I'd rather go to Joon's or The Fry for good chicken....though the portions here were decently large. 

Conclusion - not worth the time and money. Didn't really understand the menu on the ipad and we had to ask the waitress (who happily explained to us). I definitely would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"????????????......????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????......"}
{"text":"Taste was good but the Spicy sauce was a bit too sticky. One pot of food is good for 3 people. I enjoyed watching the cooking process. If never had this, worth a try!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Like other reviews below, it's very expensive for what it is. If you're willing to drive a bit further, I'd recommend going to Richmond Hill or Markham instead. Just don't come here."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 1/10 -- Service: 6/10 -- Ambiance/DÃ©cor: 7/10

I....don't....understand.

Why was it $110 for three people to eat a few shrimp, a few chicken wings, a bit of lamb, and some vegetables? It wasn't a three-person meal either. It was a two-person combo plus one an small dish of veggies and a plate of lamb. 

You walk in and it smells great. The food itself was fine - not great, but not bad. But there's so little that you end up ordering a bunch of side dishes and even after that, it's still way too little food. 

They stir the food for you and will tell you when it's ready to eat. It probably takes about 20-30 minutes for the food to fully cook. It's just kind of strange that you sit down to watch food slowly cook.

It's just not very special and nowhere near worth the price. Skip it."}
{"text":"Visited the new location in Richmond Hill. Unfortunately, there were no location on Yelp as it is a new location. 

The food was actually fantastic. We ordered the bacon, chicken wings, spare ribs, and pork intestines in a spicy sauce. It was fantastic. 

Problems that occurred were the following:

1) They just opened and so ran out of rice. 
2) The wait time for the food was SOOOOOO long. If it was a long wait for the seating, we would have gone somewhere else, but it was a long time for the food. (approx 35-40 min during the lunch period). 
3) The price for the food was expensive. 

Pro:

Great Food
Perfect spice combination
fresh ingredients

Con

Overpriced
Long weight
not enough food (they ran out of rice)

I'm pretty sure that it was priced per dish, so it may have been better to go in large groups. Then the price wouldn't hurt as much."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. That pot of chicken is $60+ and it's all bones. Anyone could've put a pot on the stove and wait 20 minutes for the food to be ready. If there's no participation involved in table cooking, what's the point of putting a pot in front of us so we can stare at the food. My girlfriend normally doesn't even eat a lot and this is the first time I've heard her say she's hungry after the meal. We got an extra plate of lamb cause we are not full and it's $1 for a thin slice of meat. Total bill ended up being near $100 and we felt like we barely ate anything."}
{"text":"Food was meh and it was so expensive for the time and what you get. Unfortunately for us, the service was really bad. The experience felt curt and rushed for such a long meal. Maybe we just had a bad experience  but I don't think I would come back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is worth to go to, i order seafood with their sauce and its amazing. Its a good place to go with friends and hang out. Its for everybody come and try it....."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check out this place because it's rather well-known amount the Chinese speaking community. However, after giving the place a try, I don't think I will come back ever again.

Environment:
Located between the Finch and North York Centre subway station, this restaurant is very easily accessible. The interior of the restaurant is nicely renovated and it's rather spacious with good distance between the tables. I saw on other reviews that this place has long line-ups, but when I went for Sunday dinner the tables were never full.  

Food:
This is where I take off the stars. The food is wayyyy too EXPENSIVE. Between me and a friend we ordered a Combination Pot and it was $60. We got to order from an ipad and for the Combination Pot we got to choose 4 items from a list of meats and veggies, 1 ready to eat cold food, and 2 drinks. There was nothing on the list of meat and veggies that were super expensive, with the exception of frog legs probably, so I feel that this place is very over-priced. The actual taste of the food was nice and I quite like the flavour of the sauce, but at the end of the day, the price keeps me from coming back for a second meal.

Service:
Your typical Chinese restaurant service, no waiter assigned to your table, you can call anyone around for service. Though my friend was rather annoyed that the waiter didn't bother to talk to him because he wasn't Asian."}
{"text":"Somewhat known chain shop from China so we decided to give it a try. (Did not go on Yelp until I was seated so by the time I ordered my expectations were pretty low) 

We got the Alaska cod fish pot without add-ons and the non-spicy sauce. I really liked the sauce despite it got a little boring after eating half of pot of the same flavour. 

The sweet potato was yummy because at first when they dumped the veggies in I thought there were just carrots and celery. 

See the steps in my photos. 

The food is definitely average but I would say it is good for a friend date since there's plenty of time to talk when the pot is cooking. And sharing the pot is pretty nice (Minus the simmer pot smell on your clothes and hair after you get out of the restaurant).

The total came up to around $65 which I thought was not worth it splitting between 2 people. Would not come here again unless I have to for social gatherings. 

My tips: if you can eat spicy, the spicy sauce probably taste better, and 3-4 people with a few add-ons would be decently price per person also there would be more variety of food to eat in the pot."}
{"text":"Not sure why this has received bad reviews. When we went, the service is above and beyond. Yes, the cooking style is not the most efficient but that give us a chance to talk to our friends. The food is tasty. This is on the pricey side of chinese food, but for the experience and the taste, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"If I could give -5 stars, I would. They charged $60 - $70 with no listed price on the menu for a plate of chicken wings with \"secret\" sauce that tasted so salty it made scents. They made soup out of the sauce after we finished the wings by pouring water. Great. Not only now it taste yucky, it also looks absolutely disgusting.

Ridiculous charge on side dishes for slices of lotus and tofu. They counted exactly 1 slice of lotus and 1/2 piece of tofu per person on the table.

Don't get me started on their steamed white rice. It was cooked unevenly. Some parts were mushy and some parts were barely cooked. In the same bowl. How do you open a restaurant without knowing how to even cook white rice?

Is this a real restaurant or just a front for some dodgy business practice?"}
{"text":"I was about to go there last night we looked inside and it was empty only 2 people were eating inside,we heard about this place from a friend and decided to try it. When we got in no one greeted us even though there were 2 people behind the counter after they just stared at us I said for 3 people they said we are closed...now why the **** does it say on your sign close at 1am even though we arrived at 11pm?! Even on google it shows it closes 3am? 

Now after reading the many NEGATIVE reviews and how overpriced it is I am so glad we didn't end up going here wasting our money on this! I wish I could give ZERO stars"}
