{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I've been coming here for over 6 years when I was introduced to this cozy cafe by a friend. 

I have only come for breakfast because its so good. If you are a french toast fan like me you will love it. The prices are awesome. For example a french toast breakfast with eggs and choice of meat is like 9.00 and it includes coffee. I mean if I were to go to any fast food place I'd drop six bucks anyways. Might was well have a good meal. Feels like homemade. 

I cant say how much i love this place. 

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My go to local  breakfast/coffee  shop.   I use it for catering for business meetings in downtown charlotte.  Very accommodating and great staff that treats us like family."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service. Huge breakfast burritos and good waffles with fresh berries"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to come here for breakfast. Love the cozy feel of the place and the food is great. This is the only place where I will eat french toast. I don't normally like french toast but love how they make it here. They offer different coffee flavors, which is nice. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible! As soon as we sat down we were brought coffee cups that had lipstick almost all the way around the rim. More than half the coffee containers were empty and the Half and half was empty. We were the only ones in there and staff was all standing around doing nothing! When I got my club sandwich the fruit was molded! Neither the cook nor the waiter seen the green fuzzy strawberry sitting at the top of the pile of grey looking fruit! The sandwich had 2 pieces of meat on an some bacon that must have been cooked last week and was cold!  I was offered some fresh fruit cut today but neither the waiter or the manager if present offered to take the molded food off the bill. First and last visit to this place.


In response to questions it was last Saturday and the meals had just switched from breakfast to lunch service."}
{"text":"Intrigued by the menu so I headed out on a Saturday evening. Despite advertising a 10pm closing time and workers walking about the restaurant the doors were locked at 8:30pm and my presence ignored. I won't be fooled again by this place. Advise to call ahead in order to determine if they're actually open. Beware."}
{"text":"The veggie omelet was very good. Came out promptly and was hot. Kitchen or waitress mixed up toast order. Waitress didn't seem all that thrilled to be waiting on us, but was competent."}
{"text":"A great little locally owned cafe.  We've made our way through much of the menu, often depending on recommendations from the staff, who have never steered us wrong.  Love their soups, sandwiches and salads.  Always happy to head there for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot....ate with family and tried 4 sandwiches and 4 sides.  Both adults and children cleaned our plates. The veggie panini with chipotle mayo was delicious with a hint of heat. The fried green tomato BLT was buttery and bacon filled without being overwhelming. We can also recommend the Caprese with its herby mayo and the grilled cheese with the hint of sweet apple inside. 

This will be a regular lunch spot and a place I bring friends and family when in town."}
{"text":"Not bad... Not outstanding but the food was good and the coffee menu is above average. A note of caution if you get the smores latte...ask for the graham crackers on the side..."}
{"text":"We started coming to this place about a year and a half ago and fell in love with it the ownership was super nice and the staff was friendly and the food was plated wonderfully with fruits on the side and tasted like it was cooked in someone's kitchen with love. We went there today and noticed that the bacon was microwaved we got one piece of toast instead of 2 and it wasn't plated  the same way. My husband's waffle and bacon were cold. I immediately noticed that none of the little items on the shelves were there that you could purchase to make gift baskets or treats at home. I inquired and found out that this place is under new ownership as of January 2nd and unfortunately we were able to tell the difference. Please change it back to the way it was!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place ... I really did. Fort Mill needs a good place for breakfast, but this certainly is not it. I have been here three times, and with my wife twice, but we will not be back. First, I will tell you on my first visit the place is not well laid out, and it is confusing as to how one actually orders. I finally got in a line of people, but never did see a menu, other than what was written on the big board behind the register. So, I took what I could get. They make a pretty good Caf√© Latte, BUT they only have artificial sweetener, or regular white sugar ... no sugar in the raw, no Truvia in the raw. When you charge as much as Starbucks for a cup of coffee, you should at least offer more sweeter options than McDonalds! Ok, on my second visit, I managed to find a menu ... it is not very extensive, but was at least able to order something. It was ok ... not great. On my last visit, I wanted a muffin ... they were days if not weeks old, and the first one had mold on it ... literally. So I got the second one .... it was soggy, and bland, and had been made maybe not weeks ago, but at least days ago. Couple this with the prices, and you may as well go somewhere else. Even one of the fast food restaurants next door will be a better choice, at least they have enough turnover to keep the food fresh, and the cost will be at least 1/2."}
{"text":"We just ate lunch here today after church at Forest Hill. I was shocked that they weren't busy! The food is fresh and the server Josh is really nice! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Much nicer to be seated and waited on. Service was friendly and food was good   The potatoes were really good. Loved the seasoning!  We will return!"}
{"text":"Used to live in Ft Mill and this was one of my \"go to\"  spots for coffee and breakfast.  The food was really good and made as if someone was taking extra pride in what they were plating. I havent been back to visit in over a year. I decided to make a trip on my most recent visit back. I noticed the name was a little different but went anyway. The dynamic of the place seemed different with assigned seating and waitresses. I ordered the egg salad sandwich I figured simple was the best way to go. Not really. The sandwich was plain and dry. Dressed with a white mealy tomato and what seemed like precooked package bacon. There was a flavor that I could not put my finger on but it tasted off. I didnt finish my sandwich and left not feeling great. Not a great experience to come back to. Sorry to see good  places take a turn for the worst. Hopefully they can concentrate on the quality and fresh made stuff. Maybe next trip back I will stop by but I doubt it."}
{"text":"I've been reading the reviews on how great their coffee is, but I just wasn't feeling it. Just a less than average cup of joe. It tasted like it was made in the wee hours of the morning. I bought it around 1:30 pm, and I'm pretty sure you'd have to make a fresh batch every few hours? 2-3-4 max? I also bought an extremely stale cookie. It was almost prehistoric. What a shame! and waste of $2.50."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The girl and I normally share our fo9ds. We had the chicken mandarin orange feta spinach salad, and the turkey cheddar apple wrap. Best I've ever had. Staff was nice and cordial"}
{"text":"A little confusing if you enter the left set of doors; you don't realize that you need to go to the counter to order.  No one told me but I eventually figured it out when no one came to my table (after seating myself).  I had a philly cheese which was very tasty.  The food was fresh and the staff was friendly (once I figured out the process)."}
{"text":"Very nice relaxed place. Friendly staff. Would recommend their Lox omelet. Very different but very good."}
{"text":"Disappointed in recent changes. 

We have been going here for several years  for breakfast and lunch and it used to be \"our spot\". After new ownership the food changed slightly but is still pretty good however pricey. 4 out of 5 stars. The service however has seriously declined. Now you have a waitress instead of ordering at the counter. Today our food took 45 minutes to come to our table. I was also told that they couldn't add ham to my omelette because they were too busy. Even though several other omelets come with ham. They used to go out of their way to accommodate. 2 out of 5 stars. So sad because we really loved this place before!!! Go back to counter service, quicker and more convenient!"}
