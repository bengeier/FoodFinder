{"text":"This is by far my favourite Hakka(Indian) Chinese place to order from. Not only is the customer service good but the food is the best I have had. This is officially my number one go to for some wonderful Hakka(Indian) Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Really good spicy crispy meat dishes, especially their lamb. Upscale ambience without upscale prices. One of my favourite hakka places. All meat is halal too."}
{"text":"Me n my husband are big time foodies.. Heard alot about this one on radio, so gave it a try... was not sure , but their supervisor convinced me ... On Friday, they had 2-3 servers, not at all crowded, 2 families including us... my  review:-
 Ambience-2.5/5 (mix of Indian music with Chinese lanterns n okay lighting)
Service-4/5 (beginning we were noticed n then forgotten but later the servers were almost at our table every 5 min) 
Food-3/5 (it's a good effort for Indian-Chinese, but a lil bland for medium spicy; ordered: vegetables chowmein-3/5, chilli chicken -3/5, spicy paneer sizzler-1.5/5@bland)
Expense-$$ ($36.42 including taxes)
Quantity-good(had to take away paneer sizzler)

Overall it's a 3/5 for me, coz its not Indian Chinese or just chinese by taste as its not even close to it, but it's good for the crowd who haven't tasted Indian Chinese, or who can't eat spicy food) if I don't have any choice, I may eat here again!"}
{"text":"Came into town from Philadelphia and staying in the hotel across the way from the plaza. Had bookmarked this place just because of the great reviews! It was everything and more. Went in about lunch time....they were super friendly! Gave us some menu favorites and we trusted them! Food was great! The Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice was so good! Will definitely visit again before we leave."}
{"text":"They were kind enough to accomodate 2 families at close to 10 pm on a Thursday night. The server was very humble even at this hour.  Food was really good, only their chinese biriyani failed to impress. Will surely visit again."}
{"text":"I love Hakka Food and have a preferred place to visit when the need arises. This place serves very different Hakka food compared to the other places I've been to (around 8 different places now), so it's hard to compare them to others.
I visited for lunch and ordered: Chicken Pakora, Chilli Chicken (in gravey) and Spicy Crispy Beef. All dishes were listed with a chilli pepper beside them (on the menu) which denotes spicy..which, unfortunately, they weren't (to be fair, I do have a high tolerance for spicy foods, but these dishes should not warrant a spicy label)
Chicken Pakora - everywhere else I've had them, they've been dry. Here, they come served coated in a red sauce (tamarind?)  that is mildly spicy, and covered with green onions and sliced onions. Although not what I was expecting, they were excellent. I did notice that the longer they sat in the sauce, the spicier they became.
Chilli Chicken - the gravey was a bit too runny for my liking, but very flavourful. I noticed that the breading on the chicken absorbed the sauce, which made them a bit pastey. Not bad, not great. 
Spicy Crispy Beef - it was dry rubbed and excellent, but not spicy. It was probably my favourite dish. Although you could see tons of chilli pepper seeds, it lacked heat completely. 

The above meal came with basmati rice.

Our server was excellent, attentive and friendly. Decor was a bit on the tacky side (dried flowers used a curtain ties, etc), but I didn't come to eat the decor......

Would I come here again? Yes, although I would request the heat factor be turned up a few notches. ."}
{"text":"Wings ok need more flavour . Fry rice ok . Chillie chicken not bad. Staff very friendly . They are very expensive . Only thing lunch special are 6.99-7.99 I think I would order again only cause they are right there"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a Indian twist on my Hakka and stumbled upon Guru's. Before walking in I read a few reviews and was armed and ready to give this place a go.

Totally unassuming from the outside, the place was nicely decorated, staff was friendly and happy to bend over backwards to make me happy. I looked over the menu and ordered the Szechuan chicken, Chili Beef (dry), Chili Chinese mix Biryani & Veg Chow Mein. I also noted that most reviews found the food mild and bland so I asked for it hot. 

TIP: Other patrons were also requesting the spice level & mostly asking for their food hot.  If you like spice, you need to request it or they will play it safe.

The food arrived, it looked great, ingredients and veggies were fresh, the food is definitely with an Indian twist, but tastefully done, it did not derive too much from the usual Chinese Hakka. Spice was present in all the dishes I ordered and was about a 7 on 10 for heat, which is where I like it. Preparation of the food must have been done on the stove. I noticed most of my food was not oily and had a more cooked taste, which I enjoyed. Only complaint was the beef, which was slightly on the firm side, but, I did ask for it dry.

Overall, I think GCC makes a nice place to go to for a twist on the Hakka experience. I  would recommend giving this place a try if you want to do the fresher & less oily experience. Great for beginners and those who want to change up their mundane Hakka dinner."}
{"text":"I came in not expecting much, was in the area looking for some wedding wear in the plaza.

My wife and I sat down next to a bright comfortable booth seat on the north side and started to soak in the kitschy decor and Shahrukh classic songs from the 90's on loop.

The food came in and I was instantly drawn by the fragrant rice and dishes. Got the Manchurian shrimp fried rice, spicy dry chicken and chilli paneer.

The flavours are a bit more subtle than most hakka places I've been to, which was a pleasant change. Asking for spicy warrants a medium for most other hakka restaurants. Which is fine. A little more on the chinese side of hakka cuisine.

The wait staff was pleasant and helpful with my questions.

For what you're paying, this place packs a lot of value and has a weird quality reminiscent of old good times.

Mine may be a personal experience, but I have come here again and will continue to if I am way the hell out here again for some odd reason. Gets busy, so expect a wait. 

I'm almost scared to go again, lest I tarnish my memory of it..."}
