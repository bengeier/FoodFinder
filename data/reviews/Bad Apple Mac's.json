{"text":"Great new restaurant in Madison. Excellent service and great food with daily specials. Like the friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a trip to Madison. It's a quaint dining room with nice music. Our waitress was very friendly. The food however was average. I ordered the boss hog sandwich and it was good, just very one noted.  He ordered the jalape√±o poppers burger to be cooked medium and it came out very well done and he said there wasn't anything special about the taste."}
{"text":"Very good service. They got our order right away and we didn't wait long. The wait staff was very kind and personable. We both got the Bad Apple Mac Burger which was really good. The chips that come with the sandwiches are really good as well."}
{"text":"Came into Madison from Cincinnati for the weekend.  Had a great stay in a super fun town.   Stopped in for brunch on Sunday.   What a cool place with a strong tradition rooted in family and respect from where you come from.   The food was awesome and service quick and flawless.   As busy as our server was she made enough time to tell us about the history of the name, the people behind the pictures and her trip to Alaska with her daughter.  Wish I knew they had Mead the night before...I would have loved to have some....Next trip."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while in town for a few days to check it out. The grilled cheese I ordered wasn't even cooked throughly, half the cheese was still somewhat cold. My husband ordered a ribeye, he said it was cooked really well, but there was little to no seasoning. Not what you expect for a $26 ribeye. I wouldn't call this an Irish restaurant either. The decor inside was pretty random, no theme really and they were playing country music quietly on an iPod. Only redeeming factor was the waitress was very friendly. Even if we lived there, we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Oh em gee this place is delicious. They should change their name to Bad Ass Macs. I got the special, the super mac and cheese with cup of soup. For $9 it was more food than I could eat. Everyone else at the table got a variety of items and  was also really impressed with their meals. One recommendation: it would have been nice to do a little mixing like half a sandwich and half salad for $10 or something. But otherwise, super impressed with this place. Great food, great service, cute environment."}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise in madison. Excellent food, friendly service and quaint restaurant  A must try"}
{"text":"Im in love with their bad apple mac burger! It is so amazing. Their foods great, service is great, and it's a lovely environment. I will definitely be coming back. I recommend the bad apple mac burger, the mac n cheese, and the reuben! Everything is homemade and is super delicious! Great for kids and has a kids menu, kids prices are $3.50! I am so in love!"}
{"text":"Holler!  It was my birthday and day two of my fabulous motorcycle adventure with my husband.  Cool in the morning but warming up quickly.  The perfect day to hop on IN-62 and roll up the river from Jeffersonville to my new love, Madison.  Did it really take me 14 years in Indiana to discover this beautiful little town?  Now that I have fallen in love, I try to reunite with Madison at least quarterly, and hope to acquire a place to crash there more permanently in the future.  However, I digress.  After a hair-raising ride up river, we took a long walk to work up an appetite.  Lunch became a moral imperative.  I had noted the pink building with tables outside on a previous trip so Bad Apple Mac's was on the radar.  Their namesake burger had caught my attention: burger with bacon, Mac and Cheese, fried apples and carmelized onions.  Hell yes!  They had me at bacon, though a good Mac and Cheese gets my heart racing too.  The burger did not disappoint.  If you have a lighter appetite, split it with someone for it is humongous.    Good as the burger was, though, the chips knocked my socks off.  I did not confirm this with our server but I believe they make them in house.  They tasted so fresh and crisp and well seasoned that I ate every one with no regard whatsoever about cholesterol and fat.  Hey, it was my birthday after all, so diet be damned.  And damned it was.  Dessert was also required.  The blueberry crumb cake was amazing.  The creamy sauce that accompanied it - well, I have no shame, honestly; I licked the plate afterwards.  Knowing there was no chance in hell that I would finish the burger, my husband ordered an egg salad sandwich.  The egg salad was nicely seasoned and not overly full of mayo.  I hate when these sandwich salads are basically small chunks of protein floating in mayo, which was a real downer when I lived in the South.  His sandwich left him plenty of room to polish off the other half of my burger.    My burger was $12, but they did offer a special that day that included a brew for just a little bit more coin.  I never drink when riding even as a passenger, but another time I would definitely partake."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere.  Jazz playing in background. Nice choice of craft brews on tap.  Wine by the glass or bottle. Sandwiches are reasonably priced. Soup of the day changes at Dinner menu.  I had the Boss Hog sand which for lunch and it was wonderful.  Portion was good and definitely not too much.  I will be back when we are in the area in the future."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 7 and had no wait. We ordered the Irish Nachos and they were so delicious!  The pork loin casserole was really tasty and those who ordered the burgers loved them. The craft beer flights were also good, small selection but still good. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed as it had been recommended by coworkers and it was an upscale Irish-themed restaurant.  The only \"Irish\" theme we saw the day we dined for lunch was the Irish potato soup and the only upscale facet we experienced was some original art on the walls.  We ate there on a Saturday at noon and we were the only ones there which should have been a tip off.   The sandwiches were fairly typical sandwich fare such as a Reuben, Turkey Club, Italian, and Cuban. [nothing Irish there except maybe the corned beef on the Reuben]  I almost ordered the Cuban until I saw that instead of sliced pork, they used turkey.  Never saw a Cuban sandwich with turkey.  We both ordered the Italian and it was just OK, nothing special.  The chips were loaded with pepper which I guess some people like but I would prefer chips out of a bag instead. Service was just OK considering we were the only ones there.  I have heard there are better sandwich shops in town and will try one of them next time."}
{"text":"Janet Macintosh, owner, was the perfect hostess. We had the Bad Apple Mac burger and the special of the day Egg Salad Sandwich and Red Potato soup; both were amazing! They have a good selection of craft beers and wine. We ended our meal with a slice of Apple pie and Blackberry pie, made my Janet's Mom. The restaurant had a lot of character. Beth is definitely your go to person on craft beers, so if you have never tried craft beers , she's the person to go to and she will advise you on a great choice. I recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I always find it hard to write a bad review.  It's even tougher in your home town.  It was very busy,  the help wanted sign out front should have been a clue.  My first experience at Bad Apple may well be my last.  Our group of 4 arrived and the place was packed.  We sat at a cleared, but dirty table.   it went down from there.    Sat at a dirty table for 15+ min without anyone taking a drink order or cleaning table.   From the time we sat to the time our food was delivered it was 80 min.   One single comment that they are plating your food now, and 10 min later our food arrived.  My Italian sandwich (hot) was good.  Lots of meat and was warm.   That's the best item.  The hamburger was super well done and was supposed to be medium.  Potato chips were supposed to be potato salad .. had to ask for the potato salad.   The fish cakes were NOT done and removed from bill.  Fish undercooked.  Scary.  The pork loin casserole was drowning in oil but had a huge piece of pork.   No greens and a very sad roll. See plating pic.  Only one water was refilled and no apologies from anyone.  We had to ask about our food - twice.   Meanwhile the cooks, in full view, were eating and cooking at the same time .  One cook, or food prep person,  was dressed in running gear.  Again, these are observations.  A two or three year old restaurant should know when they are over booked and understaffed.  They should inspect the plates and talk to the customers.  We did not even get a thanks or a sorry on the way out.  Clearly they knew they struggled that night but made very few amends.      Clearly the mgt was more interested in their large groups then the table of 4 hungry locals.   I feel sorry if out of town folk had a similar experience.  It's a small town and there aren't many options."}
{"text":"Small menu but very good. The rustic potato soup was super duper good & the antipasto pasta salad was delicious. I appreciated that all the meats were very finely cut. Friendly staff & cute restaurant"}
{"text":"Love trying new places whenever we come to Madison. Terrific little place that has great service, indoor and outdoor (too hot for us) seating and really nice menu for lunch. I had the Bad Apple Burger, my partner had the Debs salad. Both were delicious! The burger combo of Mac and Cheese, caramelized onions and bacon would have been enough but the sliced apples really make it special. I asked for medium and it was a minute too done for me but still great. I recommend the Cole slaw as well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing good about this place.  45 minutes to get three sandwiches.  Waitresses unsmiling and unfriendly.  Food NOT GOOD which is most important.  Never again"}
{"text":"Very cool place on Main Street in Madison. Janet has an eclectic place with terrific food and a nice bar with assorted craft beer and wines. Live music some days and friendly staff. Not a \"bad apple\" in my book. Really good."}
{"text":"great new irish themed restaurant in downtown madison. had the ribeye. was well prepared. wife had shrimp pasta dish. good as well. good beer selection. get on in here"}
{"text":"Janet was a wonderful hostess.  Awesome ambiance good wine.  Can't wait to go back and try the food"}
{"text":"We are from California so we didn't know where to eat. We looked up a couple places and decided to try it out. I ordered the chicken sandwich, it was delicious. The girl that helped us was so sweet and made sure our drinks were always full. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 3rd visit which rounded out meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  All 3 meals were absolutely delicious.  Perfectly seasoned with high quality ingredients at affordable prices.  Creative draft menu earns an extra Star.  My favorite entrees are Deb's salad at lunch (huge portion of Greek salad, grilled chicken and cheese tortellini) & meatloaf for dinner (probably best I've ever had in my life).  Owner and staff friendly.  No doubt there is nothing but good things happening here!"}
{"text":"I ordered the MAC Meatloaf and it was god awful.  The place was empty on a Saturday night.  Should have known.  The meat was crumbed and cold with cold mashed and cubed potatoes.  It has a terrible taste.  Ordered a onion soup as well and it was damn near uneatable.  I think I have had soup here before and liked it. It was just miserable tonight.  When I did not eat any I kept waiting for the server to ask me if everything was OK.  She never did because she must be used to people not liking there meal so she knew it was best not to ask.  I will be a long time before I ever go here again."}
{"text":"Best described as Love.  Food made with and full of love.  The recipes definitely reflect a family's tradition of good food in the Midwest.  The spinach veggie wrap was fresh and loaded with veggies.  The loaded potato soup, is loaded with lots of ingredients and spices.  The hot fudge-- indescribable in goodness.  The bread pudding, whoa!  Definitely a must stop while in Madison."}
{"text":"Had the boss hog -- really good!!  Love the overall atmosphere.    Only complaint is that we had to request drink refills."}
{"text":"Chicken salad Waldorf style with their homemade bread: . French toast was money also. 4 stars because the coffee served was cold."}
{"text":"First time ever in beautiful historical Madison, Indiana and so many choices for lunch. We decided on Bad Apple Mac's since we found ourselves walking west of the square and because Yelp reviews were numerous and positive.   Restaurant was pretty full at around 1:30pm on a gorgeous Friday. A good sign! We seated ourselves and the server brought us water and menus and took our drink orders. Friendly folks work here.   Food was very good. I ordered the turkey club on their homemade bread. My partner ordered the small Greek salad. The small Greek salad is BIG. It was well chopped and delicious. My sandwich was tasty with plentiful turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato. I was a tad disappointed with the bread, which was like a hamburger bun. I was expecting bread, not a bun. Still, I enjoyed my lunch. (and next time I go to a restaurant I will ask for more of a description of the housemade bread).   Nice comfortable restaurant with a couple tables outside and plenty of room inside. Nice windows, nice light. Local art on the walls.   Pretty sweet beer and wine menu, and if I wasn't driving back to Bloomington I would have indulged. If you find yourself in Madison, Mac's is a must try. Keep an eye on your watch though, they close between 3-5pm to regroup for dinner."}
{"text":"Get the cream of mushroom soup... you can thank me later!  In Madison for a few hours on business, I decided to stop for lunch. I chose this place based on Yelp reviews and was so glad I did.  I ordered the special-- egg salad sandwich & the aforementioned soup. My favorite soup is cream of mushroom and this place had the BEST I've ever had. Not too thick and loaded with mushrooms. Such a rich flavor... now I'm spoiled for all other versions of cream of mushroom."}
{"text":"Great place everything is fresh and made with care I've eaten here twice now and will be eating here often good simple food made with pride and care"}
{"text":"This is truly an amazing place!! their service was outstanding! Their food is perfect! I loved how they kept there customers as there #1 priority! I would recommend this place to anyone!! I'm in love with this place now! I'm sooo happy i found it!"}
{"text":"What can I say other than I would come back to Madison just to eat here! First of all, super cute on the inside with all kinds of art around. Wines are delish and get the Irish Nachos...perfectly peppered potato chips that are warm with melted cheese, bacon and sour cream.  The bacon is awesome.  I had the Mac Stack...steak on mashed potato's with onions n peppers.  Super hearty and tasty. The Hubs had the special which was Pork loin Casserole with Rosemary, mushroom and chicken soup.  The soup is more than I can handle!!! I'm taking some home.  Who takes soup home??? I don't until now....come to Madison to eat at Bad Apple Macs..."}
{"text":"Lunch was superb (BLT special and Cuban Sandwich), service was attentive and pleasant."}
