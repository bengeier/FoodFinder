{"text":"Love this place, I come here all the time for one item in particular: their curry beef brisket with roti. To be honest I haven't had much else on the menu because I love it so much! The roti is crisp but soft and the brisket melts in your mouth while the curry is so flavourful.   I believe the place is family owned, and so the setting is small and intimate, but very clean and bright. Prices are good for the portions and quality, $10 or less per plate."}
{"text":"Beef Brisket Curry w/ Roti--- simply delicious, though I've had better roti in a hole-in-wall resto in scarborough, it's still really good and the curry is perfect for me. Not too spicy, just enough coconut milk, nice and creamy.  They also do party trays, as they catered our wedding rehearsal dinner. Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"When i got there, it was PACKED. The restaurant is kinda small compared to others. Went there to celebrate my sister's birthday since she LOVES malaysian curry and we just accidently came across this newly opened restaurant. Waited for about 20 minutes before actually being served or even looked at. Service was VERY slow. I usually like to eat malaysian curry, so most of our entrees were curry with roti. I'm not much of a beef lover, but the chicken curry was pretty good that we ordered 2 chicken curries. If you like roti, this restaurant only gives you one piece of roti per order which was definetly not enough for such a big plate of curry! So in the end I had to order 4 more sides of roti! Overall it was pretty good, and i would reccomend others to try it."}
{"text":"So, this is actually not my first time here... came here a few times already and food is pretty good.  No complaints at all.  You come here for the curries and their rotis.    We ordered the beef brisket curry, a fried rice and 2 extra orders of roti.  I wish there was just a bit more beef in the curry.  Other than that, things were pretty good.  A little on the expensive side.  The portions were a bit small for the prices they are charging.  I guess they can get away with it, their food is pretty good after all.  Will I come back...  yes.  But will not go out of way to come here.  I don't usually have cravings for curry (never did).    I am always finding things on the small side lately... no idea why!"}
{"text":"One of my regular stops at lunch.  Located in Scarborough in the same plaza as Go For Tea.   The food is very good here. Is it as good as Malaysia?  No.  However this is still very good if you need your Malaysian fix. Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill is the best one in my opinion.   Can't go wrong with any dish on the small lunch menu, I have pretty much tried them all. But for first timers get the curry beef brisket.   Service is very fast and there is plenty of parking outside."}
{"text":"Great curry laksa noodle made with broth, not creamy coconut curry soup like how the other places do it.   So glad this place does it right.  Even my Singaporean/Malay friend says it tastes right!  They have daily  lunch specials, but on weekends, you have to pay regular price for a drink, whereas on weekdays, it's discounted with the lunch special.  They have an extensive dinner menu too, but we prefer coming here for lunch.    Things they do that make the eating experience pleasant!,...Their lemongrass chicken is so tasty and it comes deboned and chopped for easier eating.   The Chinese broccoli in beef fried rice is chopped too, not long and stalky.  They make a simple dish good and I get my protein, veggie, dairy (egg), and carb all in one dish!    Quaint restaurant, friendly owner, and staff."}
{"text":"This was the first Malaysian restaurants I have dined at when I was a young kid. This place has remained authentic and great price. The food has consistently tasted well, and the price does not break the bank as well. They have great lunch menu with good portion and their set dinner menu is great deal as well. I have recommended this place to many others who enjoy this place very much. I could list the dishes I have tried, but its pretty much the whole menu...Like I mentioned I have been here since I was a kid...  Signature Dishes: Penang Prawn Mee (Soup Base), Wat Tan Hor(Saucy Noodles), Chicken Curry (Great thick curry), Bak Ku Teh(rib broth), Nasi Lamak (rice in banana leaf) and the list goes on...Give this place a try lunch or dinner, and you would be quite happy..."}
{"text":"I like the Malay Fried Rice, it is my favourite dish, so tasty and spicy."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to for some good Malay curry. Fav dish I ALWAYS order is malak laksa? It's the coconut rice with egg, curry chicken, fried fish and peanuts. Its the best here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the curry brisket with rice and the pineapple fried rice.  The rice was soft which was good but the portion was less than I expected.   Bit disappointed since they raised the prices from the menu I saw on here.  The curry does not have a bit of spiciness and lack of flavor maybe lack of coconut milk as the other reviewer pointed out exactly.  They put some Chinese pork and shrimps in the pineapple fried rice not sure if that is authentic Malay style nothing wrong with that I guess but I would prefer to have chicken in there instead.  Average at best there are better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"They have a lot of variety of stir fried noodle. I really enjoy the rice noodle with soya sauce. Good value with their price. The restaurant was not crazily busy, so there was not long wait. Surprisingly we got free dessert after the meal, it was warm mungbean soup with coconut milk and it fits perfectly after heavy meal."}
{"text":"Order take out few days ago...just asked for singapore chiken rice and laksa to go....the signapore chicken rice was okay but rice was very salty and soggy....the laksa is huge miss....they basically used some curry sauce and add water and make it into a soup and pretend its laksa.....the chicken they put into it its liked really overcooked dry chicken....i think i would rathee they tell me that they are sold out instead of giving me that crap!!! Wouldnt recommend!!!"}
{"text":"just had \" laksa\" and roti with chicken curry at the restaurant. Laksa was an unrecognizable curry like noodles with soup. Chicken was horrid - the typical smell of overnight cooked chicken. Only the roti was OK"}
{"text":"South Asia Malaysian Cuisine is middle of the road.  Literally.  When you go to the plaza, it's smack dab in the middle.   Their location is incredibly apropos to the food, mostly starring sambal and curry dishes.  The lunch sets are very reasonably priced, and ~$9 will get you a curry and rice.  The hubs and I always go for the beef brisket curry, which is a thick dark yellow curry with stewed beef brisket and potato chunks, plus a dish of sambal shrimp with some onion slices mixed together.  Tom yum gong soup is on the watery side, spiked with a few mushroom slices and tomato cubes.  A set dinner for two (your choice of two entrees from a list, two carb servings of choice - you'll need to pay extra for chicken oil rice, coconut rice, or roti - plus two desserts, usually of the Chinese warm sweets variety) is priced at $30.  I think I'm mostly just disappointed because they used really generous with their spices and coconut milk at their old location years ago, but having changed chefs together with inflation of ingredient costs has hit them hard.  Roti is rather expensive at $3 for a small serving the size of an tea plate.  All in all, I'd come here to grab a simple and quick meal, but not to particularly savour the cuisine.  Important to note: This place is cash only!"}
{"text":"This Malaysian restaurant has been in the midland/Steeles area for a long time. It's prior location is a little further south on Midland. I think I has moved to it's current location for more than 2-3 years.   Kind of quiet for a Sunday night. There were only scattered groups for family dinner. Only one server available.  Curry sauce is flavourful and hot. Beef brisket is super tender and good amount of meat to fat ratio. Potatoes are soft, unlike some restaurants that quickly boil their potatoes and dunk them in curry sauce. The curry chicken has the same base sauce and generous pieces of chicken.   The appetizer platter had 6 skewers (chicken, beef, shrimp) and 2 spring rolls. The spring rolls could use some improvement with their filling. The satay skewers are tender but it's kinda skimpy with the meat.  They offer preset menu sets as well as \"choose 2/3/4\" from a list of popular dishes. Was pretty good price for the quality of food, this place deserves more customers.  From memory this place was known for their curry fish head hot pot. You must book in advance and takes 20 minutes to prepare.  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Their service is extremely fast and their food is really good. I got the beef brisket curry with roti and it was so delicious! The curry tasted great, and the beef was not fatty and very tender. Not to mention, the tea was also very good. Overall, this is a great go to restaurant during lunch and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A friend of my sister recommended South Asia. We went there on a Friday night for dinner. There are usually two reasons why a restaurant is not full on a Friday night, it is either food is not so good or the location is bad.   The curry beef brisket was very good but the nan was horrible. The satay skewers were so so, I had better. The Hainan chicken is definitely subpar. Service was average."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, I was very underwhelmed with the taste and quality of food. It's a decent looking place though with good service."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place about 7ish years ago for lunch only. Place used to be packed and good deals.    After a hugely disappointing meal at gourmet malaysia we decided to give this place a go after neglecting it for years.    We ordered lamb curry with roti, bbq chicken, and thai style fish cakes.   Lamb curry was decent and did not seemed watery, the roti seemed like it was either made there or was a very good quality frozen one.  I wish the curry was spicy and had a bit more flavour.    BBQ chicken was unique and not bad, it was fried pieces of chicken tossed in the sauce.  It's not something i would have ordered but it was tasty nonetheless.   The thai style fish cakes were decent and was a quick appetizer.   Will try different items next time we visit.    The food was delicious and i did not get a chance to take proper photos.    From other reviews, seems like the quality maybe lacking over time.  I hope the restaurant owners do take notice of this and will make adjustments accordingly.   We thought it was tasty but could use a bit more flavour and spice."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since I was last at this restaurant.. and to be honest, if I do come back, it might be another few years.  I came around lunch time on a Sunday and it was not busy at all. I sat down and decided to order the House Special Fried Rice Noodle (I mean if it's house special, you can't go wrong right?)  It came fairly quickly - within 5 minutes of ordering actually. There's nothing special about this  dish however. The noodles are thick. The dish was dry. There's a few pieces of shrimp, shredded BBQ pork, eggs, and bean sprouts.   It didn't taste great, but it didn't taste horrible either. Definitely did not live up to its name. I ended up needing to mix in a curry dish to add flavour though... so if you are still planning on ordering this, I recommend having a back-up dish as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time, & I returned recently and loved the rich coconut beef brisket curry with roti every bit as much as I did the first time I had it.  We also shared an order of the char kwai teow  noodles and while it has lost a step or two in the past few years, it was still decent.  Make sure you get an iced milk-tea to go with your dinner because it is a real treat."}
{"text":"A small yet cozy restaurant. Amazing curry with roti and lemongrass entrees! Definitely recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the house vermicelli, the chicken Currie and the chicken Currie laksa.    Haven't been here in a while (maybe a year) and it seems the food has gotten worse.   The Currie and laksa were seriously lacking coconut milk and didn't seem as flavourful as I remembered. Vermicelli had less ingredients and mostly vermicelli noodles.   Prices were consistent (~$7-8 per dish) so this may be a result of cut backs in ingredients from rising food costs... But I'd rather pay a little more for the quality to remain high.   A similar restaurant I find good (and compare this one to)  is White Orchid on Highway 7."}
{"text":"This place is good, just not the kind of Singapore/Malaysia flavor I  am used to. I normally order the curry lakasa, and while it was tasty, I still crave for the lakasa from Gourmet Garden or Resto Malay.  The soup base didn't have a strong coconut curry,  but for sure had it's own uniqueness. The pull tea was delicious. Good meal overall but I can't help crave for lakasa from the other two places."}
{"text":"Still great and tasty!  Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Very busy and had to wait a bit for a seat.  The quality of the food and the quick, friendly service didn't change though!   Ordered extra roti, which was a mistake as it's $4 on its own while the actual beef brisket curry which comes with one roti already is $5.99.  Guess our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, because we really didn't need the extra roti. The value-conscious gal in me just cringed at the value comparison.   The lunch menu is the same on Saturday, Sunday and holidays as on regular days - the extra tea or coffee just isn't included."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The food is nothing particularly remarkable but the service is quite fast, so if you're hungry and want something in a pinch, you can expect food to come to your table quickly. They are cash only."}
{"text":"This place has a relatively small seating area and menu. The prices are on the reasonable side.   I tried the malay laksa noodles with beef, beef brisket curry rice, and the hainan chicken rice. All the dishes are pretty standard, they taste good but nothing that blew my mind. The laksa isn't really spicy so I feel like the authenticity of this place is lacking. It'd be a good bowl of noodles for a cold day though.   Overall, not bad. Service was pretty attentive and they were friendly people."}
{"text":"If you eat out with Malaysians you will know that they tend to be the fussiest diners in all of Asia.  So, the first time I ate here, the M'sians were unanimous with their praise.  A good sign, surely.  Unfortunately, the next time with another pair of Malaysians did not yield the same praise. Admittedly, the Assam laksa was very different from the first time, lacking in the intensity that typifies the dish.  A little longer in the pot to concentrate the flavours would certainly have helped or was it the request for 'no seafood' in the dish that did it?  Some of the other noodle dishes were good (Hokkien fried noodles, to name one).   In the end, half the dishes were good, half yielded mild disappointment.   South Asia Malaysian Cuisine is worth a drop in for lunch should you find yourself in Scarborough but not necessarily deserving of a special trip."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  We ordered:  Hainanese Chicken with Flavored Rice - chicken was dry so it needed the sauce to help.  The sauce (spicy sauce and Ginger with green onion sauce) was tasty.  The rice has a nice flavor.  Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice - it was okay but needed more curry for the amount of rice they provide.  The food came really fast so don't worry if you're hungry.  Price wise it was okay as well."}
{"text":"It was a good attempt at Malaysian food. I had the nasi lemak. It had all the components if a traditional nasi lemak. The rice was severely lacking the coconut flavour and a bit too wet. The curry was also not spicy at all but more sweet and had a strange gritty texture, like it went through a blender. It isn't a bad place but I just don't feel it's Malaysian."}
{"text":"Long time customer of this restaurant, was their constant customer before they were moved there, after the restaurant have moved to this location, personally I think the quality have slightly dropped, but customers have dramatically increased, same owner, same chef which is fortunate.  Dishes in my opinion are traditional  and in avg are all good taste  big fan of their curry and chicken & rice, unfortunately don't work near there no more, so I do go there a lot less than before"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times... It's close to my summer hang-out spot (Starbucks+Popeyes) and a few friends work nearby too.  My mom used to love this place when they first opened in their original space and I did too during that time when MALAY restaurants were harder to find.  I have to say the last few times didn't really excite me as it did before.  Typically, I get items from their combo menu depending if I want something spicy or NOT.  My friend pointed at Curry Banana Roti and said I should try it which really meant HE wanted to try it.  Sliced Banana wrapped in Roti with Curry poured on top.  I'm NEVER letting this friend choose my APPS again, desserts MAYBE.  We ordered their Mix Satay Platter as well as you can see our meal consisted of Apps rather than whole mains.   It was A-OK, just like how I rated this place but I didn't see grill marks(pan fried?) and you know how I love my GRILL MARKS.  Maybe you don't.  What I LOVE is the Basil Beef or Chicken mains which is why I name it my GO-TO item if I get too lazy to choose from the menu.  This was on another occasion now as I got wise from my previous experience.    The wait lady asked what RICE we wanted.  LOL, we looked at her dumbfounded to try to figure out what she was talking about as the combo menu didn't say anything about choices.  She did give us the choices; steam, coconut milk, and something else(fried?).  They offer small individual bowls(Cappucino sized) of soups when ordering the COMBO.  2 Choices to select from: Tom Yum or Bak Kut Teh.  It's more of a Tasting than a Starter, so if you love South Asian SOUPS then order it from the menu instead."}
{"text":"My family (extended and immediate) have been coming to this place for many, many years; I even remember coming to this place at its old location when I was a young kid (who was super picky and didn't eat anything).   The food always comes out quickly; came in today at 2pm and left full and satisfied at 2:40pm. My personal favourites are the beef brisket curry with a side of roti, and the sambal green beans with beef. The curry is thick and sweet (not very spicy), with hints of coconut. The roti is flaky with a good chew. The sambal green beans are never overdone, and always have the right amount of spiciness! My one qualm about this is that the stir fried beef, while tender, doesn't taste too \"beefy\".  Whenever we're in the area, we're pretty likely to come back. Also, cash only!"}
{"text":"Small and simple family-run restaurant serves curry that really fluctuates from great to okay. It gets nostalgia points for carrying me through some days in postsecondary.  Curry used to be a golden standard here, but it doesn't taste as good as I remember since the potaties are a bit harder and the meat less tender than before. There was a time when I'd order two dishes for myself here every visit: one curry, and something else to try*. It's not on that level anymore, but still a spot for a fast meal.  What I'd Get Next: Malaysian curry with beef brisket *The fried noodles and the porkchops were AMAZING, but I haven't gotten them in a couple years now.  Their curry roti is more expensive than their curry rice... And the roti is real good, but is literally two (maybe three) bite-sized.  Also, I am nitpicking now, but I've always found their tea a bit strange.  All in all, my postsecondary memories of this keep bringing me back once or twice a year..."}
{"text":"Had a craving for laksa .. was disappointed with their seafood laksa .. tasted like Tom yum with seafood and noodles .. the old lady that speaks no English totally ignored our request for napkins .. last but not least it is cash only"}
{"text":"I came here the other night with a group of 6 on a weekday. The place wasnt really busy so I assumed this place wasnt that good. But, boy was I wrong! The food is really good and cheap so if you you're craving curry and roti, you should check this place out! The skewers are also really good! :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what this place is but it's not malaysian. The curry tastes like curry powder and water. No belachan. Nasi goreng was bland...we will not be back"}
{"text":"ive never tried any malaysian food before this so my review may be a little bias but i LOVED their curry so so SO much ! i love the food here, but the bf thinks its pretty overpriced for asian food esp in that area .   dont go here expecting good, or even average, service when if you go during the busy hours . the servers aren't the friendliest but they definitely dont go out of their way just to make your meal unpleasant . to me, it seems like theyre just doing their job and nothing more, nothing less .   also, they close really early on tuesdays . i dont know if that's the case anymore but once i came all the way from north york after work, DURING rush hr, cuz i wanted the food so bad but they were closed when i got there . :( i left them a note and shoved it in the gap of their door cuz i was so disappointed . i dunno if they got it or not . =P"}
{"text":"I remember coming here years ago and the food has not really improved during that time. I had the chicken curry laksa and it tasted very monotone. The laksa wasn't spicy at all, not even a hint of spice. It could definitely have used a more flavor. The noodles was a mix of vermicelli and egg noodles, but there was randomly one strand of hor fun in the middle. Details like this makes you wonder what is going on in the kitchen in the back. The prices are cheap though, making it a simple quick easy meal but definitely not something I will be looking forward to eating again."}
{"text":"I get Seafood Curry Laksa 9 out of 10 times.  The other dish that I get is beans and beef stir fry. I've had Restoran Malaysia and Malay Thai but this one is my favourite.  Cash only.  Small space but we've always been able to get seating quickly.  Good service,nice folks."}
{"text":"My favourite dishes in this restaurant are: any curry with roti, hainanese chicken, lemongrass pork chop on rice, satay skewers.  I came again today with a group of 23 people, yes, a very large group of people.  And they helped us a lot, like moving around chairs and table, ordering, etc.  I'm very appreciated for their help.  I can't take spicy food, but I can't stop having their curry.  And I need their Teh Tarik to cool down the heat.  Their Teh Tarik still very good."}
{"text":"My Orders: Nasi Lemak (delicious), Pork Chop w/ Rice (I've had better), Curry lamb (tasty)  Pros + Location: close to pmall, other establishments and a residential area + Parking: ample  + Ambiance: not fancy, but clean and comfortable.  + Service: quick  Cons  - Washroom: dirty. The brown soap turned me off.   I'd come back for the food. It's a family hot spot."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I've been on a Malaysian diet as of late. A comfy little restaurant with ample parking everywhere as its in a large plaza. I went here nice and early on a weekday and arrived before noon just like Jennifer K suggested. And boy was she right. Right when the clock struck 12:00 a steady stream of customers started rolling in. Tried the Curry Laska with seafood and the chicken roti. Around $8 or $9 for these dishes. The taste was good but compared to other places like Saigon Star and One2 Snack the flavors and quality of the ingredients just don't compare. Don't get me wrong, this place is a very good Malaysian restaurant and I would definitely return but I would go to the other 2 places mentioned before coming here. Good portions were served so I'm happy about that. Overall a good restaurant and no real complaints but definitely had better."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Dine-in: Tom Yum (for +75cents)+ Chicken Ho-fun Take out: Hai-nan chicken with rice  & Lemongrass chicken and rice  Likes: hot, fresh, quick--straight forward menu South-Eastern cafe that caters to Chinese audiences The place was clean, the server was efficient--  Love the lemongrass chicken-cut-up, easy to eat, tasty Also love that you get the option to have dark/white meat for the Hainan chicken   Price point is great for a quick lunch    Not so like-- They didn't specify that there'd be bean sprouts--a love it/hate it item--in my case--eeks  Ho-fun was stuck together--if I have known, I'd order the vermicelli instead  Hainan chicken-rice was salty but chicken wasn't salty enough"}
{"text":"Orders: Combo C - appetizer platter (2 shrimp skewers, 3 beef skewers, 3 chicken skewers, 2 spring rolls cut into 8 pieces), lemon grass chicken (there is pork option), curry shrimp (choice of yellow or green curry), tom yum soup, green beans and shrimp, hainan chicken, roti (1 piece)  Pros: lemon grass chicken, green curry shrimp (spicy and yummy but could be better with a bit or curry flavour), roti (flaky and chewy just the way I like it)  Cons: - tom yum soup (taste like packaged powder cooked with some tomatos, mushrooms, shrimp, squid and basil) - hainan chicken (no chicken taste, green onion and ginger dipping sauce had no kick nor flavour .. if you know your hainan chicken, do not order this here) - roti (bc it came with 1 piece for a combo meal for 3-4 people ... the piece is size of a small dish ... not enough to share if you really want to enjoy every spoonful of curry there is) - lemon grass chicken (just bc i ordered pork and they gave me chicken) - $2 for 1 bowl of rice ... debatable yes but considering we had to order 2 bowls for not enough roti...   Service: not terrible but did not enjoy the eavesdropping during the whole time I was there.  They listen to every whispered order decision we made rather than let my group discuss.    Overall, 2nd time here but probably won't be coming back.  Other than curry, i don't really recommend anything else much here.  Also, TIP, all roti orders come with 1 roti... trust me, it's not enough to wrap the dish + mop up the curry."}
{"text":"Typical asian fast paced place.  Don't look for customer service here and personality.   However the food was great and cheap!  Always like a cheap meal.  I had the beef curry roti (#11).  Served differenly than your regular roti.  Beef was wrapped in the roti but the curry was on the side which was kinda nice because it doesn't get so messy.   My roti and coke came for $8.76 - can't go wrong for dinner.  Will definetely return to this joint."}
{"text":"Took out some Assam laksa to test for future visits. Tried a spoonful - the rest is in my fridge for later.  It is good.  3.75 star worthy.  This is a complicated dish to make in terms of balance of flavours.  Sweet, sour, spicy, salty.  It was busy, the roti canai looked outstanding but I controlled myself and did not order one as much as I was \"chalishing\" (look that up) to do so.  We will be back.  The only thing I noticed is that there appeared to be a lot of coconut milk in some of the laksas which I saw people having.  We were treated well - they were nice.  Something to consider for the future."}
{"text":"I came here as there was no wait and was too hungry. A decision I irrationally made lol.  The food here is not the greatest, I had their lemongrass chicken with noodle soup and a friend had their Malaysian curry noodle soup. Both of the soup bases did not taste very good. The ingredients included were also minimal.  The only positive for me was the speed of service. Within a few minutes our noodles were served.   There's not a lot of options in this plaza but I would say pick somewhere else if you're in the area"}
{"text":"I love the Malaysian curry and roti lunch special here. The curry is extremely flavourful and the quality is consistent. I've been coming here for years and recently paid a visit. It is honestly one of the best Malaysian curries in town. Parking isn't so bad at lunch, but can become hectic during later hours. This place loses 1 star for accepting cash only but otherwise, I highly recommend anyone around the area to try this place.   I have not tried the other dishes at this place so I really cannot vouch for the other dishes...but I'm definitely curious about the laksa!"}
{"text":"After reading the comments about this restaurant, I gave it a try this evening.  Malaysian curry beef brisket taste wonderful that can't help but keep on eating more and more rice with it.  We also tried Prawn with samba sauce and Belachan shrimp with tofu, both taste good as well.  Also there's a free dessert-black glutinous rice with coconut milk, that's a perfect dessert to round up our meal tonite.  For sure I will go again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I came here because I really wanted a good bowl of bak kut teh. Unfortunately this restaurant doesn't deliver on that. I first tried bak kut teh in Singapore, it was peppery, with a faint herbal taste, but it tasted good with the fried donut.  Here, I stepped in and they were renovating. Which was fine, but they were blocking the front door, either close during construction or do it during another time.  The bak kut teh, it taste just like the packet ones, very salty and overly soy-sauced. The rice is dumped into the bowl, this is not how you present the dish. The rice is separate. It has no herbal or peppery taste. And instead of fried donut that you dip into the dish, they have fried tofu, not the same.  I also ordered a roti plain, this one is okay. Flakey and good and the dip tasted nice. But so disappointed in bak kut teh.  Service was lacking also, I saw the menu on the table, it looked small and asked if there is another menu (nope to that)."}
{"text":"In search of a good Malaysian restaurant in Scarborough, I came here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. I started off hopeful even though we were the only ones in the restaurant at 9pm.   Our order: chicken and beef satay sticks, curry beef roti, okra in sambal sauce and curry chicken laksa. All the dishes were mediocre at best. Satay sticks tasted Vietnamese rather than Malaysian; laksa had vermicelli instead of egg noodles; okra was probably the best dish but still too sweet. The worst was the roti which I am 90% certain they had microwaved. The curry was thick and meaty which might sound good but is definitely not authentic. The curry was sweet which is a more Chinese style vesus Malaysian. All in all I was disappointed and probably wouldn't return. :("}
{"text":"I had really low expectations coming here. I couldnt decide what to eat and i really wanted some laksa in a cold winter's day. Even though the reviews seem to suggest that the place used to be good and has gone down hill, i was ready to take a risk because of its proximity to where i was staying. However, the risk did not end up coming with rewards, even with my low expectations. The Laksa was very watery and my husband's curry was not good at all. I think this place is popular with the lunch crowd but i definitely wouldl not be back given the food was not good. They do have a high chair for the baby though, so i guess that's a plus if you need to come with a kid."}
{"text":"I wasn't been here for many years, and perhaps it was not a musktake....    But the mistake was that I Was here about 1pm, and the only reason I came here was because one two snack was too busy and I was just hungry.  I should have driven to another place to eat...  The place was half full.  There was one two seater and one four people table, I was told to sit in the 4 people one because the two seater \"could be merged with other\".  Ok then...  I heard the next table ordered chicken curry laksa couple minutes before I ordered mine.   And the noodles literally came after two minutes.  I was wondering mine came faster than next table's......    The soup color looked like their Penang hokkien mee that I had there few years ago.  Taste was bland like what other ppl said, and the chicken was all shredded like those leftover from making chicken stock.  The best part was when I almost finished there was a big group came in and they don't have enough seat to accommodate them.  The minute after I put down my chopsticks the owner came and asked if I have finished.  I think they are very rude and bad service, food is not worth the price even it was cheap."}
{"text":"A sudden crave for bak kut teh brought me to this place. I like their offering, though I haven't had bak kut teh in years so I can't compare.   I ordered the milk tea accompanying the daily special thinking it would be teh tarik, but it is just regular Hong Kong style milk tea.  I usually order Malaysian curry beef brisket with roti, which I think this is one of the better places to get it from in the neighbourhood. The asam laksa I had last time was enjoyable too. Next time I will try the curry laksa."}
{"text":"This is a family run restaurant tucked in a small plaza, but they have good food at good prices. I like the hainanese chicken rice here. Not the greatest seating and environment, but the service is quick and there is plenty of parking in the lot so it is a good choice to grab a quick bite of Malaysian food that is not too greasy or salty."}
{"text":"Lunch Special still decent.  Curry Laksa Soup Noodle with Chicken ($6.50) though lacked depth in the broth.  Maybe not 4 star material but still a decent 3 star for lunch special at south Asia Malaysian Cuisine."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza that has many food choices, I walked there already smelling the charcoal from Chako (which is nearby). I was excited to try this small quaint restaurant with minimal decor as I haven't been to Malaysia. It appears to be a family owned restaurant and from our table you can hear the kitchen's wok.   The menu is large but we ended up with a combo deal of four main dishes with steam rice and daily soup.   1. Cold steam chicken is like any other Chinese restaurant. Nothing special.  2. Curry beef with potatoes wasn't spicy and it could be hotter in temperature as they probably already had it made.  3.  Stir fried broccoli with beef strips. It's was salty and not memorable. At least the broccoli wasn't over-cooked.  4. Stir fried triangle tofu pieces with large shrimps. It's an interesting combination. I would just have made it as a vegetarian dish than adding the protein. The sauce didn't match well too. At least it was hot in temperature.   Verdict: there was nothing Malaysian about the food. It felt more like a Chinese restaurant. Nothing was authentic from the country. So I would rather go to a congee place instead of this one."}
{"text":"One random week night, I was craving Malaysian curry. So we went to the nearest Malaysian restaurant, aptly named South Asia Malaysian Cuisine. The lack of creative naming aside, the curry here is quite tasty.   Now onto the food.  My boyfriend opted for Malaysian curry beef with rice. I thought this was pretty good. Other than beef, there was also a few pieces of tofu puffs in the curry, and I liked how that soaked up all the sauce.  I ordered roti canai with curry. The roti had a crispy, almost crumbly crust and wasn't as soft and chewy as other rotis that I've had in the past. Although I enjoyed that crispy texture quite a lot, but I wished the inside was softer. The curry was quite delicious, but not spicy at all. I also wish they gave me more curry, because I used up all of mine and had to borrow some from my boyfriend's curry dish to finish my roti.   We also shared spring rolls. At first, I was disappointed that it resembled Chinese spring rolls that you get at dim sum, which I'm not a fan of . Thankfully, the filling tasted Vietnamese, concealed by the Chinese-style spring roll shell. I was decently satisfied with this version, though I don't think I'd be ordering this again the next time I come.    All in all, I like the food here, although nothing is outstanding. But given its convenient location for me, I'll be coming back a lot for curry."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now, even before this location and the current owners. Really have to say the quality has slowly gone down. The staff doesn't seem as inviting and energetic about the restaurant anymore. Also looks like the hours of operation keep shortening.  Can't really say there's anything wrong with the food, it's pretty average and the staples but nothing really stands out either. It's just a \"meh\" meal, something to fill up on and a quick lunch without having to put any thought into.  Overall, it's close to home and a place family still goes to so will definitely be back. Just not in the near future, might be an annual visit. Definitely prefer other places for these dishes."}
{"text":"Perhaps I've been spoiled, but every place I've been to that serves Malay food, whether it's a sit-down or hole-in-the-wall, I've always been wholeheartedly greeted with smack-in-the-face intense flavor.  What happened here?    I ordered the beef brisket laksa curry.  The curry was bland.  The roti was tough.  The only thing going for this dish was the beef brisket was nice and soft.  The egg with rice noodle dish was so bad.  The noodles were overcooked and had a burnt taste.  The eggs were not cooked through... like... it was raw... At first I thought it might be a starch slurry that didn't get mixed into the sauce very well... but the way it held together was exactly that of raw egg white.  Just awful...   I'd compare the food quality here to that of a bad Chinese food court.  The ones where its god awful, but mehhh it's cheap so whatever... cept this place isn't cheap with free drink and soup...   The service from the young man working there was alright.  The lady that worked there, however, had the attitude like she had no more fucks left to give... like her default greeting has become \"what do you want?\"  Which is all good if you have the food to back it (Johnny's Hamburger comes to mind)... but no... not here... sorry..."}
