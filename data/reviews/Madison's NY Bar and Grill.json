{"text":"Great food, only the chicken breast I once ordered was dry. Excellent steaks, drinks and of course their ribs. Great casual place with professional staff. Great atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"Went to Madison's for a beer after work. Beer is the coldest on the West Island. Service excellent. The TV's within the bar are not overwelming like some other places. Have not had the food in the resturant  but the bar food OK.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to have a cold beer and relax after work."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Madison's.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I will make an exception for this one.  I ordered calamari as my appetizer; it was delicious.  Calamari is a tricky thing and too often I've ordered it only to be greeted by a dish of what has the consistency of rubber tires.  These were very good.  I also ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was tasty and done properly.  I did find that there was a bit too much on my plate - it is advertised as New York style and the serving size did seem to be very American.  A doggy bag was in order.    The service was very good, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Food was just OK nothing special.  We had the ribs, hamburger, chicken fingers ect.. Side note: Pepsi products  Ribs We're ok a little overlooked very sweet and sugar tasting but overall not bad.   Hamburger Had the standard hamburger not bad little pink in the middle but I like it that way. But if you don't make sure you tell them how you want it.   Chicken fingers Again nothing special Standard chicken fingers.  A little chewy.   Loaded baked potato Not the best out there, Believe it or not I prefer the Wendy's baked potato to there's. The loaded potato was lacking toppings and no sour cream!!The staple to a loaded baked potato.   French fries  We're good probably the best thing on the plate sad to say but the true.    Service Below standard. Waiter started off ok with his name and specials. But as soon as he took the drink orders things went downhill from there.  Forgot to Bring the drinks we ordered!! Food came out and he did not even noticed we still had NO drinks. He had to take the drink order again.. Lol  The waiter only came but once during dinner to see if we needed anything.   And the most important they started off by asking you if you would like naturalized water for a $1.00 more and when you say no they bring it to you and tell you it's on the house. We heard him say it to every table around us and one table said sure. But every table has it on it. Lol. So if you say yes they charge you $1.00 per bottle and if you say no you get it for free. Which is very shady to me   Bathrooms  Nice looking needs to be cleaned a little but acceptable. 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered an $18 nacho figured I could get a lot of meat and other veggies! Nope had about 5-6 small pieces of pulled pork and lots of tomatoes! I think I'll just stick to ordered beer rather then ordering nachos!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a little while. I was very pleased with the new drink and food menu. I started with a cucumber gimlet, which was one of the best drinks i've had in a very long time. The chicken wings were delicious, they serve it with this BBQ/ranch sauce and it was amazing. For my main course i got the ahi tuna salad which was very light and refreshing with the mangos. The tuna was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Definitely Mediocre: I agree with a previous poster's description of the clam chowder as a starch plate.   We ordered onion rings as an appetizer and it looked and tasted like what you would get a burger king, it obviously came from a freezer bag.  My fries also came from a freezer bag and were limp and rubbery.   I had chicken tenders for lunch, though it appeared to be made in the kitchen, only because I noticed that the batter was terrible.  My colleague had a steak that he described \"as not bad but not good\".  Interesting....   All in all,l I think I would have been happier either eating at a Burger King or skipping lunch altogether."}
{"text":"Ok - So I've been here before and didn't like it but I thought I'd give it another chance.  I decided to take my mother here for a birthday lunch as we were going to see a movie at the nearby Colisee.  We started with the pan-fried calamari and the onions rings, both were very good - the calamari was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the rings were crispy not greasy. Both my mother and sister chose the Madison's burger for their main - the burgers were grey - way overcooked and very salty. They also had a house salad with some kind of a ginger dressing - it was ok.  I ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad - which was swimming in dressing and the chicken was also very salty. I couldn't bring myself to eat the greens. I know this is a chain but come on - not good enough.  One positive note was our waiter who was very charming and attentive. He even brought over a brownie with sparklers for my Mom, which was very sweet.  All in all meh. They should serve the dressing on the side, cut down on the salt and not squish the burgers when cooking them (as I suspect) rendering them dry.  I think I owe my Mom another lunch after that one!"}
{"text":"Came here after a corporate event for dinner. We were seated quickly and our waiter presented himself and mumbled the specials. I don't know if he was having a bad day but he came across as odd and uninterested. Took our drink orders which for a large group came out quickly. Found was good, not great, well presented and decent portions.   Decent parking is available but after that experience I doubt I'll be back. I really hope that waiter has better days."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I have so much to say but to keep it simple the manager at this Madison's has 0 skills in customer service. Possible the most rude and arrogant person in the industry who should be trained in basic human decency. Out of the 40 people reservation we had 5 people who were exactly 13 minutes late at some point. Instead of him politely asking us to start with the orders which would have anyways not been done in less than 10 min due to the large number of people, he took one of our table away while we were waiting for the rest of our party who were 5 min away. When I asked him what he was doing he answered in a very arrogant tone that he needs that table to accommodate others customers. 13 minutes in only!!! We already had 35 people seated which he didn't seem to care for what kind of service is that?!? Only when confronted about the horrible service experience he brought the table back. It's a shame because the rest of the staff was very polite but this man ruined the experience for all of us and you can be sure there will be no more 40 people reservation coming from any of us in that restaurant."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Olympic Park and just wanted a quick lunch and a beer before our planetarium show.  They had just gotten in a huge group with only one waitress working.  We let the hostess know we had to get back to the planetarium.  They did an incredible job of serving us in time and the Madison burger was great.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I liked the flavor of the clam chowder, but it definitely needed more clams, and it would be better accompanied by oyster crackers or the table bread they serve instead of the sesame bread sticks. The Oriental chicken salad was large and was very tasty. The service was quick and top-notch. BTW, I was there at lunch time and sat at a table in the bar area."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Classic Madisons' chain look. Classy, clean and offers a warm-feel to it.   FOOD: The food here is pretty good, not the best place around but still good. Ribs are always a good choice here. The baked potatoes could use a bit more flavor in my opinion but they aren't bad. And the salads are huge! I usually always have a doggy bag because portions are so big.  PRICE: Prices are decent, not too surprised here. Standard grill prices. I do like the fact that they offer weekday specials. Sometimes they'll even have their 2 for 22$ ribs which is fantastic!   SERVICE: Service is decent. The staff don't really go out of their way to make your experience the best but they aren't bad either. They do their jobs and that's it."}
{"text":"So , this is the first time I have even been to Madison's on a Sunday  known for their special 2 for 22$ . I have to say for 22$ for two people to eat was pretty decent . The baked potato was great chicken tenders good . Only thing I did not like was the honey Dijon sauce . So I opted to ask for the BBQ sauce they put usually on the ribs and it was delicious . I would definitely go there again on a Sunday   , a nice family place  with good pricing ."}
