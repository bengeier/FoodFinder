{"text":"This is my favorite Korean food location, the quality is as good as the food court in Korean Mall, and other Korean restaurants I've been to.  But the price is a lot cheaper.  Portion is good.  I can't find one negative.  Love it.  Very nice owner, I wish I could have found it earlier"}
{"text":"I love love this place!!! Very good and affordable Korean food.. I've been eating here for like 9 years now, because I used to live nearby before.my family and I are regular here owner are so nice always remember us. Come eat there you won't regret."}
{"text":"She's the korean grandmother you wish you had!!  The price is on point and the hot stone bibimbap was bomdiggity!"}
{"text":"It's not a BBQ place but the food they got is GREAT! I can eat there everyday. Kimchi Jigae and BiBimbap are the best in town. The lady is so nice too"}
{"text":"The owners seem like a nice, friendly and attentive couple. The spicy squid I ordered was just right at the requested mid spice level - very tasty without any unusual flavoring, texture or aftertaste.

I always like the little bowls of veggie appetizers. This time, it included both radish and turnip kimchee, lightly toasted tofu, soaked eggplant, etc. I do, however, kind of miss the soy-sauce-soaked-potato bits, and thin sliced fishcake that was common when I lived in Hawaii. The mini-food court seating is simple but pleasant - not the usual fast-food-chain decor.

If you're looking for fancy, look elsewhere. If you want good Korean food at a reasonable price in a simple comfortable place, you really should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best place ever for Korean food and the owners are very friendly. If your feeling for good service and food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the prices are reasonable. The service was also excellent. I would definitely recommend this place if you want homemade Korean food served by two lovely couples."}
{"text":"The owners Ray and his wife are so sweet and she is an amazing cook!   I had the teriyaki chicken which I wish I would have eaten slower to enjoy each bite, however it was just so tasty.  My husband had Be Bim Bop which he said was one of the best he has ever had.   Plus they have boba tea!"}
{"text":"Umm, wtf. Based on the 5 star rating, I've been meaning to give this place a try for the longest time. I finally happened to be in the general area, so was looking forward to some good Korean food. You know when you enter a place knowing that it's received such high accolades, you go in with a certain level of expectations. Even if you try to go in with an unbiased, completely open mind, it's hard not to have certain ideals in your head. But when you're met with almost a complete lack of customer service, period, it leaves your mind twirling and confused and wondering if you just stepped into the wrong establishment. That's how I felt anyway.

So my experience went like this: Went in around lunch time. The food 'court' was mostly empty, but I was greeted with a very off-putting, unappetizing smell. There was an older Korean woman preparing food in the food court, out in the open. Umm...shouldn't that be done in a kitchen? But whatever

So I perused the menu and pictures on the wall, deciding what to get. I had a question about one of the dishes, but apparently the woman at the counter thought it was more important to balance her checkbook than to acknowledge or make eye contact with a potential customer right in front of her. After I rudely (/sarcasm) interrupted her financial activities by saying \"excuse me\", I asked if they could substitute a different kind of meat in one of their soups. Specifically, they only offer seafood tofu soup, but all I wanted to know was if I could sub beef instead of the seafood. She firmly said no, no substitutions. 

Okay fair enough. So I decided to just go with my second choice and was ready to tell her my order, but then she walked off because apparently she had an urgent personal phone call to make /sarcasm. I stood around for a little while, waiting for her to come back, but she never did.  The old woman making food at the tables didn't care either.

Not sure if this woman is one of the owners. I'm guessing not, because I can't imagine any owner treating a customer like that. I'm usually forgiving and understanding that Asians can be lacking in the levels of customer service that Americans are typically used to, but to me, it was just straight up carelessness. But either way, not even going to attempt giving them another chance."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean Food! We had bibimbap and kalbi! Sooo good! I loved the owners! We are part korean so it seemed like we were at our aunts house not even a restaurant! Reasonable pricing, go elsewhere and its ways more! I'll be back to try everything on the menu! They also have smoothies!! Mmm refreshing!"}
{"text":"Man Na Teriyaki and Korean BBQ (Manna or Man Na? i don't know as the sign and business card are different spellings)  is hidden in the Food Court  building next to the CSN Charleston campus in Las Vegas.  The prices are very decent for korean bbq. The side dishes always change depending on what they have and what is in season. They also make boba tea and smoothies, but I have never tried it yet.  
   The food comes out already prepared and cooked and there is plenty to eat.  The Galbee/Kalbee/Korean short rib is LA style with thick pieces of meat.  The bulgogi is ok. it wasn't as tasty as the Galbee.  The bibimbap was also very tasty with a good portion of meat and vegetables given. They also serve korean soups, and SPAM musubi.  A $1.50 for one spam musubi is not bad as they use a very tasty sauce.  
   The lady that runs the place is also very friendly, she speaks the most english out of the three ladies that work  and cook there.
    This place does not serve the top of the line quality meats that you would find in an expensive korean restaurant, but it sure satisifies a korean bbq craving without breaking the bank.

This place is open 10am-6pm and is closed on weekends and have modified holiday hours.  They also have daily specials in which they take a couple bucks off of a certain menu item."}
{"text":"First visit here.  It really is a little hole in the wall place located in a very small strip type building.  The good news is the food is great.  They have photo's of the food and prices posted above the window where you order.  Just food court type seating.  We ordered beef with veggie hot rock and spicy calamari.  Five bowls of assorted pickled veggies and a bowl of steamed rice accompanied the orders.  The wife's hot rock was very tasty and my medium spiced calmari was very good and not too spicy.  Veggies were interesting.  There was kimchi, chayote, tofu, thinly sliced potato.  Met the owners and they were both very nice.  Will definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Mom & Pop place in a food court with limited to no atmosphere, so you may just want to get your food to go.

The owners are extremely nice people and they put out some mighty fine Korean food, let me tell you.

I've had the bulgogi plate and \"spicy beef soup.\"  Both were just fabulous.  Portions were large, I had enough for leftovers in both instances, and I'm a big eater.

On my first visit, I asked the nice lady to explain what each of the banchan items were.  I received an additional plate of banchan for my troubles...something was lost in translation, I guess!  :)

If you dig Korean food, you really should check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lota of free sides, affordable prices, and ran by a sweet couple. The hot bi bim bap is the best and I get it 90% of the time I go there."}
{"text":"In order to find Man Na, you need to go into that building next to CSN that says \"Food Court\" (feels so weird to see one of those outside of a mall).
 
This is why I go to Man Na: Spam Musubi for $1.50. Delicious, and a great, CHEAP alternative to those of us at CSN sick of Mickey D's and Jack In The Crack. 

Unfortunately, this food court doesn't seem to get a lot of business, it's always so empty in there. I've heard that someone is planning to make one of the booths in there a Soul Food restaurant. Let's hope it' opens soon, because if I can get some gumbo, sweet potato fries or hot links for a price which is similar to that of the Musubi at Man Na, I may never stop at Mickey D's when hungry at CSN ever again."}
{"text":"This place is Wonderful. 
The place is located in a random food court building with 4 other resturants near the corner of Charleston and Torrey Pines. It is the perfect example of why you should never judge a book by its cover. I ended up ordering the Hot Stone bibimbap, and I have to say that I was simply amazed. This was by far the best bibimbap that I have ever had, and the prices are very reasonable. While waiting for the meal to cook I chatted with the owners for a little while, and they are absolutely wonderful people. Though I have only tried one thing on the menu, the other items I saw come out looked great as well. I am excited to go back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered marinated beef and soup togo from uber eats..the bbq meat was soo cold..it look like the food from last night..they did not heated at all..it cannot be this cold if they cook it right away at least 20min ..cuz the soup was still hot at the same time..Please can you guys cook the food at the time of order received  !!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little korean joint located in the same plaza as Kaba Curry and Wing King. The korean food is pretty decent and priced very well. Had the spicy pork kalbi and it was very good. The portion size was good and so was the flavor. You don't really get a lot of side dishes, but you really don't need it for these prices. The condiments are sparse but good. If you're looking for a good cheap lunch at an affordable price, you should definitely check out this place. And if you're still hungry you can pick up some curry and wings at the other places next door."}
{"text":"Hidden gem but so worth it!! Best service. Haven't been here in years and they still remembered us. Husband and wife owned. They are amazing! They make you feel at home and the food is very tasty. Also comes with extra stuff and isn't expensive. Try the spicy pork or bulgogi. Glad they are still open! Do not let the location deter you away. It is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Server was interrupting my phone call kept egging me on to buy my boyfriend food. She was just bothering us and made it up pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the couple that owns it are very nice! Lots of food for a good price definitely a go to for local korean bbq here in vegas"}
{"text":"Usually a group of us will come in on Friday's for lunch. Lots of good food. Spicy pork and the kimchee is my favorite. Cant go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"Me n my friends went to eat there after class since it's near CSN . We loved the food . The owners r super sweet n nice . I recommend this place for anyone because they hav delicious food n great service! We'll keep coming back because it's so amazing!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great food and great prices. I will be coming back. I had the bibimbap and a taro smoothie."}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch and found this place on Yelp. Don't be afraid of the lack of fancy decor. When I first walked in it looked a little less than inviting but I was p proven wrong as soon at I placed my order.  The gentleman who took my order was very accommodating. I live my life on the low carb diet and I ordered the Bim Bim Bop with no rice and they didn't bat an eye at my request. I usually get some strange looks when I ask for it to be prepared this way. They even offered me an extra Egg!! The woman cooking up the goods in the kitchen was fast on the grill and came out twice to make sure I liked it and that it was prepared correctly. It was delicious, fresh and perfectI will be back!! PS, bathrooms very clean. I don't know about you but that's important to me!!"}
{"text":"Great food made by great people! So good! I especially like their bibimbap. I personally ask to have the beef left out because I'm pescetarian! STILL DELICIOUS with just the veggies and egg. I also had the chocolate milk tea! Very good I'd highly recommend the combination of these two as they were filling and satisfying. I cannot wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Man Na is amazing. The man and woman that own it are just the best, ever. They are so sweet, and they make sure everything is perfect for you. Their food is out of this world, most of it is very spicy, but it is soo good. If i could i would ask the woman who owns this to just come live with me, so i could eat her food all day every day."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious food.  This husband and wife team are so sweet!  The wife is the cook (Korean) and the husband served our country!!"}
{"text":"We used to live just across Charleston down the way (less than 5 minutes) - and my husband swears there's some sort of addictive ingredient in their fried rice! 

We love this place! Nani (not sure if this is how she spells it) is a wonderful woman and a great cook! She is friendly and warm and remembers her customers. There was even a day we forgot to pay for our meal (we were engrossed in conversation with her husband) - we went back to pay for it after we ate at home. She was surprised to see us back so soon and when we told her why, she simply smiled and told us we could have gotten it next time! 

We brought my parents here, who instantly loved the place, too. It's a bit different because it is a very limited food court setting, but it does well. 

The flavor in the meals is pretty consistent and everything I've had has been good. The portion size is good for the cost and there is a generous serving of sides, which can be refilled if you ask :) 

I usually stick with the spicy squid because I don't get to eat it much and I'm picky about the flavor. Hers has NEVER disappointed me. 

When I have work trainings and business on this side of town, there's no question of IF I will stop by, it's all about WHEN. 

I would say this is a pretty inexpensive place. A lot of the items are under $10. Very good prices for Korean food."}
{"text":"The previous reviews were right... A HIDDEN GEM. This place is in a weird location, but man don't let it fool you the good is good. It's located after redwood and charleston, which is super close to CSN. If you're a student there and skressin about class come here to eat some bomb korean food to help relieve some of that skressin! It's owned by a very friendly couple inside a food court looking area. They close at 5, so lunch is most ideal for this place. I ordered the kalbi and my girlfriend got the stone pot bibimbap. Both were amazing! Safe to say that the taste beats what you find at Greenland. Close to that good ol' home cooked grandmas cookin. They give you a good portion and the prices are super cheap. Other Korean places usually charge $11-$12 for the bibimbap, but it's only $8.95 here. The kalbi is only $11.95 and you get your usual side dishes and rice. Give this place a try! I'm excited to try the squid or bulgogi next."}
{"text":"Manna has one of the most authentic Korean dishes out there. The couple who runs the shop are the sweetest! Definitely a place to check out :)"}
{"text":"I feel very fortunate to have come across this great hidden gem! I eat a lot of Korean food, this is probably one of the best! Don't let this outside of the building fool you, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Owners were friendly, food was great! super close to CSN! if you have a break between classes, try this place out. (:"}
{"text":"Best Bibimbap in town.  Super nice owners and the food is awesome.  The only downfall is it's located in a indoor food court so atmosphere is something to be desired."}
{"text":"I got the $9.95 galbi special. It definitely tasted like L.A. galbi that I often crave living in Vegas. I got five side dishes with my order - japchae, daikon, spicy tofu, kimchee, and a mini seafood pancake. I wasn't crazy about their kimchi but overall the galbi tasted good and the side dishes were decent enough. Good portion size for lunch. If you want to satisfy your KBBQ craving at an affordable price, come by. Nothing is over $10. The only thing I didn't like is the food court atmosphere. It's depressing here!"}
{"text":"Looking for traditional, non MSG, authentic korean dish that KOREANS eat at home? Come here right away. The owner is Korean and she is also the main cook. I ordered tofu light spicy, it is the best. Not too salty, not too bland..perfect. shes also checking on each customer if everything is ok and fine..she will refill any side dishes BANCHAN if you want for free. They are nice owner and we should be supporting this type of local business..DONT EAT AT CASINOS..OVER PRICED...USUALLY $30 PER MEAL.. come here outside and enjoy great,healthy meal! Coming back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter can cook! She makes really good gal bi and bulgogi. The owner (don't know his name) is a veteran and was hanging around there that day, he is very friendly and gave me a free drink for being a student. I don't go to the CSN right near this food court but I drive all the way there every two weeks or so to eat here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great price and taste. It's a little hard to find, but this place is an awesome hole-in-the-wall Korean BBQ spot. The owners are very nice and it's not very busy when CSN classes aren't in session!"}
{"text":"I was around the area when I decided to try out Ahjumma's food again. Gosh, it's been a year or so since I came in here but she still recognized me. I love her and her cooking! Her husband too that never fails to give the customers that genuine smile of his! I always get this #7! The beef with rice and veggies in a hot bowl! It's a small and quiet place and out of the spring mountain area but dang, their food is the best!"}
{"text":"strongly recommend.
great food with cheap cost
and they also provide FREE soda every time."}
{"text":"Like other reviews, this place is a little hard to find. Hopefully with the picture that I took from the front, you will be able to see where it is. It is actually in a building called food court. Inside this food court is a hole in the wall place of yummy for your tummy. 

I love Kal bi aka beef short ribs ($11.95).  Marinated beef ribs....  Let me tell you, I was licking my lips and fingers trying to get all the goodness in. 

My better half got the beef short rib soup ($8.95). Beef broth soup with green onion, egg, cellophane noodles and short ribs. If you are dragging, not feeling well, or getting over a hang over, this is something that might help. Comfort food all the way. 

This place has authentic Korean food at very reasonable prices. 

The owners are funny and easy going. I'm glad we had time to come here. Now this is one of my go to places for Korean food. So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food with very accommodating owners, originally wanted spicy pork but gave us another option and loved it! Gave us a huge order but ended up finishing everything! Hole in the wall Korean food but it was def worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch today and loved the food! The place is a little awkward since it's inside a building's food court. This is more like a fast food/self-served place. The ladies working there are nice.  We ordered a bibimbap and a kalbi tang. They were both authentic and delicious. They gave us 5 side dishes and offered refills. I have never seen a fast food place provides that many side dishes, which is a two-thumbs up. Portions are big and the bibimbap even even came with a bowl of kalbi tang! 

Food didn't come out as fast as a real fast food place, but the wait wasn't bad. I still managed to get back to work within an hour.  What a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"This place is really bomb, I cant believe I never bother to step into this place to try it out, I've seen it so many times but just kind of shrugged it off cuz it looked like sketchy but after reading the reviews I decided to check it out
I got the seafood soondubu jjigae and omigosh was it delicious, very flavorful broth, the ban chan were really good
The lady who seem to have cooked all the food seem to be very nice, I enjoyed the food and service, will be coming herw more often"}
{"text":"Ma-si-sseo-yo!    I'm so impress with Manna, that I want to help out every South Korean in America and take a baseball bat to Kim Jong-un's head.     Swing batter, batter, swing! then \"the sound of crack of a bat\"....and  today's lunch was a home run! 

This is the epitome of mom and pop establishment, because I only seen the very friendly older man, and his wife running this place when I got there around 1:00pm.  

What I found pretty funny, that they modified the names of each meal to help out the CSN college kids, who comes to this very unique food court.   Bimimbap is just titled Rice, beef, and vegetable bowl, and looking at the pictures on the menu board,  you know it what it really is.    Don't get me wrong, just because the menu name is changed for Korean cuisine challenged, their food is100% unmodified Korean recipes from the wife's mother.   It had that home cooking feel to it.

Being next to CSN campus, you kind of understand the majority of clientele will  most likely be nearly broke college kids, and Manna does take care of them because nothing on their menu is over 10.00, and there's a couple of daily specials that are 2.00 lower than the daily regular price.   

Well, we ended up ordering Gabitang (listed as Short Rib soup 7.95), Bulgogi (Marinated beef 9.50), and a $4.99 teriyaki bowl.    It didn't take too long to get our order done, and our banchans came out first.    It was nice to see this, because If I didn't see this on Yelp, I would have never thought this could happen is this food court.    They bought out six different dishes, and all of them had right amount of sweetness and spiciness.    The Gabitang was very good, and they put in the a generous amount of short ribs and green onions, and I really enjoyed my bulgogi!   They gave a good amount of meat for the price, but what surprised me was the value of the teriyaki bowl!  WOW, that was DEAL!   It was damn big for the price, but I don't know that tasted like, because the bowl was clean out before we left, (I guess, my uncle was pretty hunger) 

I'm a big fan of this place, but why the four star?   It's too darn far away from Henderson, and the location is not easiest to get too.  If they were in east side of town, I think they would get my  final star, because their better than any other Korean establishment near Henderson.   

This review will be Manna's 14th Yelp review, and one more four star rating after mine will earn them a Yelp sticker, and letter from Yelp on their achievement.   From what I learned from talking to owner, he love reading Yelp, and mentioned about the large turnout on last week's CYME Kaba curry event.     

Finally, if you're not into eating a AYCE Korean smackdown....give this place a try because you will not be disappointed at all, because you will taking a takeout plate with you home.   Yes, they gave large portions of food.

kamsahamnida Manna!   I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Korean food I have tasted in Nevada. The owners are seriously the best people ever, they are so nice and polite!!!! Price is affordable and really cheap for the amount of food you get, and you get a lot of free side dishes too. I tried the bibimbap, yookejang, galbi, and bulgogi and they were all delicious. You won't find a better place to find home-style, Korean comfort food!!"}
{"text":"nice place! good food! if u attand CSN, be sure to pay this place a visit. the lady Chef is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"i never seen disgusting \" restaurant \" like Manna Korean BBQ .
The food is terrible !
The Owner -his name is  Ray  is so rude !

Don't choose this place if you care about your health !!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to go to after school! I just wish it closed later than 5. The prices are great, especially compared to the mediocre food at school. I wasn't familiar with Korean food & the owner helped me out. I've gotten the bibimbap, the hot version of that, today I tried the dumpling soup. The bibimbap is definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"Great home style Mom \"Korean\" food that had that home cooking taste, very friendly and price was spot on for an enjoyable lunch stop. Husband was very talkative, and full of jokes, some very funny- would suggest to tone it down as could come off as offensive to some.  Great location if you have a group and not everyone wants Korean as there is other food available as it is in a food court location (Wings, Hawaiian, Pizza) -"}
{"text":"Very friendly, walked in and they waited for me to choose my order, very humble place but organized and looks clean, I didn't wait long for my order they asked if I like spicy and brought out the little plates w. the sides and utensils they also asked me if I used chopsticks so they kindly brought me a fork, the only thing is it's in a questionable area since some old man that was drugged kept bothering the food court, I left pretty satisfied I usually go for dessert but I was too full I got the marinated chicken, to be honest although the taste was great I really do wonder how fresh there food is because I am super picky came in because of all the good yelp reviews it was alright! They gave me a free water bottle too omg that was too kind"}
{"text":"Delicious! Two thumbs up. The price is great and proportions are large. Great for sharing. I ordered the LA kalbi. Nothing was left but the bone. The bibimbab was huge and everything was fresh and a good. It was a great home style cooked korean meal."}
{"text":"I went with a group for a work lunch and was nicely surprised by how delicious the food was. The bibimbap was fantastic along with all the little side dishes that came with it and it was only $8 with a drink included.

The food took a little while to come out to our party (about 30 minutes), but I think the main reason was they only had one worker who cooked food for our group of seven, while the owner was out delivering some catering to a nearby business. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap and authentic Korean lunch. Definitely will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious, very inexpensive, and the people who are there are very nice. No decorations, but that hasn't stopped me from coming here to eat."}
{"text":"First to find this place you need to enter a dated food court building that looks deserted. Once inside you have a choice of three restaurants and Man Na is to your left. Service is warm, and food is delicious. Family operated, they are both happy to help you with food options if Korean is new to you. From spicy squid to bibimbap, and egg rolls to spam masubi fresh and tasty is the game played here. The wait is noticeable bit bearable as you wait for you food to be freshly prepared, and they don't skip on portion size. 

Prices are VERY reasonable and lunch specials are also available aka today's special. I highly recommend stopping in, especially if you attend CSN as its only a few hundred yards from campus."}
{"text":"Wonderful \"home style\" Korean food. Had the bibimbap and some dumplings. Flavor was wonderful and the service was pretty quick. Since this restaurant is in a food court, other people in your group can have something else if they're not into Korean food. This place is a little hidden away, so it can be easy to drive past it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"You know it's legit when there's a nice korean lady up front to take your order. Everything is priced right and all the entrees are served with the usual banchan items (complimentary side dishes).  It was a great place to stop for lunch because it wasn't busy and the food court was empty around 11 am.

I ordered the spicy pork (which was good, but not spicy enough for me). My coworker ordered the LA galbi which I thought was great! Especially for the price. They have a daily special which almost made me order 2 entrees but I thought that would be pushing it. 

I will definitely be coming back. Really good korean food and the prices are really reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's my favorite find so far in Vegas.  Amazing Korean comfort food, try the bulgogi!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends on the first day of college. The food was AMAZING.  I would definite recommend this place for all the students that go to the CSN Charleston campus since it's close by.  The owners are super NICE.  Honestly, the food is very comforting and made me feel like my parents made it.  :)  I'll definitely be back with my friends!"}
{"text":"Food was great and owners were so nice!! They made sure we were satisfied and kept on checking up on us. Would definitely come back if we didn't live in California!! ;) we had the teriyaki chicken and la style beef ribs. Price is definitely cheaper than other places and their food didn't leave me feeling greasy and bloated!"}
{"text":"A friend took me to this location.  The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the smell.  We asked what it was and was told it was the sewer from a hole in the ground covered up by newspapers.  I think the entire food center should have been closed because of this.  My friend said the last time they were here there wasn't a smell so maybe it's just temporary.  We got our food to go and just ate in the car.  I got the hot rice bowl and I tried some of my friends short ribs.  I'm not a big Korean food eater but the food just wasn't good IMO.  I gave an extra star for the nice people."}
{"text":"Manna Korean BBQ is like my go-to-place for Ubereats or doordash. They have really good food which makes me happy. I went with my aunt recently to actually eat at the location and it's a hole in the wall kind of place that probably gets overlooked. The elderly man, Ray, there is probably the owner with his wife and they were very friendly to us which made it more comfortable. Ray came over a few times to check on us and see if we needed anything else. We asked for more fish cake and he was happy to get us more along with some more napkins. Prices are fair so you can just bring at least $15 to get your meal plus drink and the Korean side dishes."}
{"text":"The Lady and her husband are the best, they are kind and very attentive and the food is awesome taste like a home made food very fresh and tasty best place to como with friends and family if you like the real Korean Food!!!  my favorite place !!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are both homey and wonderful, but the location leaves a lot to be desired! I wandered over from my school campus to grab some lunch and study and was impressed with the authentic food served here.

It's a husband and wife operation and they do a really great job of everything. I ordered the SPAM musubi and a bulgogi lunch plate. They warned me that it would be too much food, but craving a musubi, I went for it.

Everything was fantastic! The ban chan was fresh and homemade, and they weren't kidding with their portion sizes!

The husband was very chatty and definitely distracted me from my studies, but it was pleasant conversation.

The only reason I'm dinging a star is the location. It's in a really bizarre food court type set up with communal food court type bench seating. It was really warm when I went in which was during summer some time ago, but I can see this being a problem as it approaches 120 degree weather. It's hard to enjoy good food with an atmosphere that kind of put me on edge.

Go for the delicious food, but accept that it's a mini-adventure.. and don't bring a date."}
{"text":"Very nice mom and pop shop. The location is inside the Internet cafe near the car wash. It's a food court. So don't expect fancy seatings. But really is the seatings important or the tasting of the food and quality? Food of course. Yelp is mainly for food anyways.

Food was great. Banchan was good especially HOME MADE KIMCHEE! Super good! I can't express how well and seasoned it was made. But the fish cake needs to warm up to be softer. Other than that 4.5 stars! 

My husband got the Seafood tofu soup and it was good. They gave us a lot of muscles than what you would get at other korean restaurants. He wished it was more spicier. He love spice.

I got the hot stone pibimbop. Careful it comes out really hot... It's hot stone duh!
I liked it. It was good for the price.

I'll come here again! It's a little bit closer to me than having to drive all the way to spring mountain."}
{"text":"Despite value menus, I don't want to have to eat fast food when I forget to bring lunch on campus. The only thing I've tried so far was teriyaki chicken and their bobas. The plate was a good size for the price, it was enough to share for two. I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

Seriously, I used to go here everyday for lunch back when I attended CSN. But since I've transferred I haven't been able to go back as much :( 

Not only is this place affordable compare to pretty much all the other Korean joints around town, their food is delicious and the portions can feed 2! They may not have ayce Korean BBQ (since its more of a cafeteria style eatery) but they have all the Korean staples: bulgogi, spicy pork, bibimbap, LA style steak, etc. and everything tasted real good! 

If you go to CSN or live close by definitely pay this place a visit! The only problem is they don't really have consistent business hours. They close pretty early (around 5pm) but when they're not busy, they sometimes close early."}
{"text":"LOCATION:
Honestly I've been to CSN soooo many times and I've never notice this EVER. Its located in a building which houses a food court with other mom&pop pop-up spots like Kaba Curry and Wing King (both I've yet to try) and more. They really should market to the college students. I mean their right there in walking distance. 

FOOD:
Seafood soon Tofu soup TO GO: 
not sure if it was because I was to go, but I felt even after I told her SPICY, my soon tofu soup was very watery. Don't give me wrong it was delicious! Very flavorful and very hearty. Just different than what I'm used to. The seafood soon tofu soup came with a lot of seafood, again more than im used to. I was actually surprised how many mussels I had in mine. Overall good soup just watery. 

SERVICE: 
great service, the women that takes your order (I presume also owns this little hole in the wall) was very sweet, she even told me for next time to call and order ahead since she figured I was there on my lunch break (since I was in scrubs). Very sweet of her. She reminded me of those old Korean grandmothers who just wanted to feed and feed you. I'm not complaining. :)

Definitely coming back to try their Korean BBQ. maybe then I'll give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Korean Restaurant + Hole in the wall location = GOOOOOOOD KOREAN FOOD!

Came here for lunch one day and everything was on point! This is a very unsuspecting location. It looks like a small mall food court. The menu had a decent amount of items listed. They also serve bubble tea. I didn't expect to get ban chan with my meal. I figured all I got was an entree and some rice. NOPE! Only legit Korean serve ban chan and that made me so happy! They served a number of pickled veggies which are my absolute favorite! Of course there was kim chi and some spicy tofu. The portions were a good size I even went home with some leftovers.

This place is ran by an older couple. The husband runs the front while the wife does the cooking in the back. They make a wonderful team. The husband is really nice and chatted with us a bit.  I found out they serve an elderly community everyday. What a great thing to do! 

The prices here were cheaper than what you would find in the main Chinatown area. About $9 an entree compared to $13 otherwise and you're getting good quality food so I can't complain. 

Definitely check this place out if you're in the area or craving Korean food. They close at 4-5 pm so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located across from CSN in a weird looking building. Its like a food court with about five different restaurants minus the mall and the fanciness. Although it is not a fancy place the food is very authentic and tasty. The prices are between $6 and $10 dollars which makes it very reasonable. I ordered the hot pot (bee bin bop) with meat which was great and my friend ordered la kalbi ribs which comes with rice and about five sides like kimchi, fish cake, etc. The owners are an older couple that are always happy to chat with you and offer you personalized service!"}
{"text":"Some of the best in Las Vegas. With great prices to boot. My Korean mothers fav spot. Nice lunch spot, great banchan too
Really nice lady who runs the place, it's like eating a delicious meal at someone's house. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is not an AYCE place and in fact the outside of the building doesn't look like a restaurant at all. What it is though is a down home friendly mom n pop style real Korean restaurant with good kimchi, bulgogi, kalbi, chicken, bibimbop and a whole bunch of other things. What they don't have are the high prices of the glitzy casino and tourist trap places."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo amazing. It's been 4 years since I got to know this place. I've tried almost everything on the menu. Super delicious!!! And it's cheap!! Close to CSN and the mall is not so busy-- easy to park in busy lunch time."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself to be pleasantly surprised when you venture into Man Na, a Korean BBQ kitchen. The restaurant is in a small building called a food court, with shared tables, and after figuring that out we weren't sure what to expect. The walk up counter staff was extremely friendly and fun and coached us through the differences between dishes. The man turned out to be the owner and a Vietnam Vet and we appreciate him taking time to chat with us.

We ordered Bee Bim Bop, labeled number 7 on the menu. At just $8.95 this is a great deal! The owner was accommodating when our friend wanted a tofu version and all three of us that tried it really loved the food. If I could change one thing I'd make this dish with marinated beef bulgogi, but I understand at this price that isn't ideal.

The pickled veggies that are served with Bee Bim Bop were homemade and very fresh. The quantity of food was enough to feed 1+ and more than expected. The hot rock bowl that it is served in continues to brown and cook the rice as you're eating, which makes for a pleasant, slightly crunchy texture.

I always appreciate a restaurant that develops trusty regulars and this is that type of place. Their hours are mostly conducive to lunch (they close at 5pm) visitors. I recommend Man Na to anyone in Las Vegas who is open to a different atmosphere and dining experience, whether you like Korean food or not!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy squid, really enjoyed! My brother in law had the three meat combo, great value. The food comes with three preselected sides. The sides are typical Korean, mostly pickled."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. I tried the seafood tofu soup...it's delicious. I will going back to this place!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this Korean restaurant near my office.  The location at a stand-alone building near the college is something that is appealing to me.  Man Na locates inside a cafeteria-style food court.  The lady who took my order and prepared my food was very nice and helpful.  

The kimchi tofu soup was delicious and was accompanied with the typical Korean-fare condiments.  Even though it was a cafeteria-style restaurant, I was very well taken care of and will definitely return whenever I am in the mood for some Korean food."}
{"text":"Just read all the 5 star reviews. They're spot on. Amazing food!!

The owners make the experience feel like you're eating with family."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here with my friends during lunch break from school. The owner is nice and will even cook off the menu items if you are familiar with Korean food. The overall atmosphere is very casual, which I like a lot.   I love the mul naengmyun, its so refreshing on a hot day! I also recommend trying tak-bokeum-tang which basically korean style chicken stew. It's delicious and can serve around 4 people."}
{"text":"I was the first customer of the day waited for them to open so I can try the hot rock bowl.  It was great the owners are awesome!  Definitely coming again soon."}
{"text":"My friend and I had planned to go here for a while, and we just stopped in today! It was delicious, I got the lunch special of bibimbap and he ordered the bulgogi plate. We ate there which wasn't too bad, as it was mostly empty. The woman who owns the place was so nice and we had lots of tasty side dishes to accompany our meal!"}
{"text":"Had the Bi Bim Bap and the Spicy Seafood Stew.. both were yummy! The serving size you get and what they charge is a great deal! Mama San (cook) and her husband continually checked in on us to make sure our FREE side DISHES (emphasis on free and plural on the sides)were refilled upon request and that we enjoyed our selection. This is a small and casual place packed with flavor. A must try!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by to try this place out and I must say the food is really good like everyone else has written.  The side items they give you are very good and there are quite a few!  When I finished my meal, I ended up ordering to-go as well, even though I was completely full from what I ate :)  

Will visit again very soon!"}
{"text":"Manna is a hidden gem tucked away in this unassuming \"food court\".  There are a few other Korean restaurants I frequent and Manna holds its own against the best.   The Be Bim Bop is excellent and usually my go to dish.  I have had the Bugolgi and it was good, although I prefer to cook that myself at a Korean BBQ place.  One of these days I will try the tofu soup. 

I usually hit this place up for lunch because they are not open for dinner.  But that is the beauty of this food court. There are other great places to eat even if another is closed."}
{"text":"For being a literal \"hole in the wall,\" they serve up some solid Korean food here. They have all the classics like Yuk Gae Jjang, Sundubu, Mandu Gook, Dolsut Bibimbap Don't forget the BBQ (not table-top) Kalbi, Bulgogi, Doeji Bulgogi. And they even serve boba drinks + Spam Musubis. Who doesn't love Musubis with their kimchi? And don't worry, you'll still get all the side dishes here. It's like any other Korean service; they just have a walk-up window. :)

The owners are so nice! The wife is back in the kitchen and the husband services the guests. They're very friendly and actually used to have a restaurant in the original Koreatown i.e. The Commercial Center. 

By the time Man Na opened at the \"Internet Cafe\" space, my time at CSN Charleston was up and I'm rarely ever in this area. But Man Na is definitely worth a trip. If you're a CSN student or work around here, this makes an excellent lunch stop. They know you may be short on time, so call ahead and they'll make sure your food is ready for you when you get there."}
{"text":"Great Korean food!  Loads of Kim chi Ray is a hoot.  I got soon tofu with seafood, it was excellent and not too spicy."}
{"text":"I really like it here because it is very convenient for me to come for a meal during my breaks at school. The food is really yummy too. The owners are very nice and sweet. I really enjoy talking to them. 
I like the hot stone bimbimbap a lot. I have also tried the seafood soft tofu soup, which is yummy too. The owner puts mild spicy because I am a baby when it comes to spicy. The marinated beef is a huge portion. It is enough for me to share with someone but still be full. I also like how they have refills on the side dishes. The side dishes are super delicious as well. I love the marinated tofu, fish cake, the little pancakes, and the sliced potatoes. I would reccomend this place especially if you are a student at CSN. It is a hidden place and very afforadable to a student budget."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Korean food hiding in the food court near CSN!

Came here for Weeziana AGAIN (3rd time they were actually closed when business hours say open), so instead we tried Man Na :)

Ordered the LA Kalbi Ribs ($9.95): Korean Marinated Beef Ribs. Great flavor here, and cooked to a medium well with crispy edges too. Recommended! 

Bulgogi ($9.95): Korean Marinated Beef. This was a good rendition, cooked well with crispy edges. I prefer this style vs the soup/broth version personally.

Banchan comes with the entrees. Refills too! The kim chi was good, but the other varieties were just ok.

Good choice if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Husband and wife really nice. Affordable food. Didnt eat here but bought milk tea and mango smoothies"}
{"text":"This is a little counter service joint in a questionable food court. I was concerned due to the lack of customers and sticky floors but I've learned to trust my nose. The aromas coming from Manna are bright and spicy. The food surpassed expectations. I had the BBQ bulgogi and spicy pork bento box. Everything was delicious. The rice was fluffy without being overcooked. I have no idea what the sides were other than the kimchi but it was all good. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2014 and I've grown close to the old couple that owns the restaurant :) I must say that I've always feel welcomed and the service is always great. The food itself is delicious with a touch of a home cooked feel."}
{"text":"I love these little mom and pop shops because you know the food will be good and they did not disappoint! The owners are also very sweet and make you feel at home with their service always checking on you and seeing if you need anything. Ordered the dolsot bibimbap which came with complimentary banchan. The bibimbap tasted like a nice home cooked meal that I've been craving for awhile and it was packed to the brim with veggies, rice, and an egg ready to be mixed in. They also give you a little pot full of the spicy red sauce to use to your hearts desire. *drool*. As for the banchan it was a mixed assortment of kimchi that tasted and smelled fresh, and hot dog slices fried in egg. The food comes out quick too if you have a short lunch break. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Moms and pops authentic  family owned Korean food, love the food! It's in a cute little food court, nice and clean.Its a place u can order up and most times they bring it to ur table! The owners are super nice and friendly! Food is always delicious and consistent, and I also love the sides! I usually get the Bi Bim Bap and  it squid dish and the soups too! My kids also love their Kalbi, it's really tender and juicy. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Near my campus and the staff is very very accomodating. I wish more customers would go here. Definitely love the teriyaki and beef and vegetables"}
{"text":"I came here after seeing the 4 and half stars on this hole in the wall restaurant. Omg. Wow. They ladies are super sweet and nice BUT... When we ordered the hot stone bibeembap, it came out with chicken. Any Korean knows that dolsot bibeembap comes with beef and you mix it all in a hot stone. The color should be a perfect blend of green, red, yellow, and brown for the beef. Well.. Today.. It was a very bright colored bowl. Instead of beef, they put chicken. I have never had bibeembap with chicken. Sorry. It just doesn't come like that. We asked what happened and they acted like that's how it normally is, but what's truly funny was that there was a clear picture of it on the wall with \"beef vegetable stone bowl\" written under it. We pointed to the picture and description and she had nothing to say. On top of that, we also ordered spicy beef soup.. And again... There was not one piece of meat in there. We had to tell them it wasn't cool to not tell us that they were out of beef. No one wants spicy beef soup with no beef in it. Sorry, only one star for me. 
*kalbi tang was good. It had meat!"}
{"text":"I don't very often give a five star. In fact, to date, I may have never given a five star. But the proprietors of this Korean restaurant inspire me to change my policy. Man-na is open 'til five. I arrived a little before that, there were no other customers, so they were about to close up shop. But, they stayed open for me. I've lived a few years in Korea and love Korean food. I was not disappointed here. The three things I tried taste just like they did in Korea. And that is a complement. Do you want to come early and stay late because the proprietors are so fun to talk to. A couple of known each other for 38 years, been married for 36, and share one passion (at least) and that is making and serving good food."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch. I've been here 7 years and it's still my favorite place to get Korean food. Delicious side foods with tasty tofu soup."}
{"text":"I TOLD YOU I'D BE BACK SON!!!! LOL

I initially came through last week to try this place out, however, discovered that my homie's place, Kaba Curry, was here and had to have it since I never had it as long as he was in business.  Thankfully, this place is so close to the crib, I can hit up this place everyday of the week.

Located in a food court dubbed, \"the Internet Cafe,\" this place is a hidden gem and probably much more known by CSN students since the campus is nearby.  I was under the impression that the place was some broke down ghetto rigged internet cesspool for child predators.  Low and behold, the place is the ish, offering multiple genres, each equally dope in its own right.  You have to come here to see it for your self.

The ambiance is, well, let's say there isn't one.  It literally looks like a food court for Tyrian Lannister (Game of Thrones), tiny yet full of surprises.  It's simplicity let's you focus more on the grinds and show your appreciation to their craft.

The service at Manna is best titled, \"mom and pop.\"  They are the epitome of the definition and reminds me of home (Hawaii).   In fact, they offer spam musubi, an island favorite at a decent price.  Word on the streets was that it uses to be a buck fifty, but now priced at two bones a pop.  

Mamasan, what I like to call her, is sweet and hard working considering its only her and what may be here American hubby.  They remind me of a good friends parents I call my uncle and aunty, typical couples back home are Caucasian and Korean, most common with military men betrothed and wed to Asian women during WWII...fun fact of the day.  I love them.

I smashed on the soondubu [sic] meal that comes with all the fixings including kim chee, daikon, egg omelete, bean sprouts, etc.  The soup was served in a sizzling hot pot and naturally a side of spam musubi completed the meal.  The kim chee seemed a little over fermented, so it was dumped in the soup to add a jige-esque taste to mask what it lacked.  Otherwise, the meal was cheap and good to go.

Apparently, this place has been here for over seven years and the veterans of the food court while many others come and go.  I can't believe that I missed this place this whole time."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you like Asian food. It's Korean style and I couldn't resist. It's in this food court close to the college campus. If you are a student at CSN, I recommend it. It's in walking distance as well.  I ordered the hot rock bowl."}
{"text":"Yes, the reviews are accurate. Had to try this place for myself. Really fresh banchan dishes, excellent dol sot bi bim bop, maybe the best in Vegas, better than what you can get at Greenland. Definitely an odd location but they've been there for 11 years! Great healthy lunch for 8 bucks. Friendly service. Hard to beat that."}
{"text":"Being that we used to live right around the corner, we ate here on a regular basis. Then, once we moved across town, we had to make special trips to enjoy the addicting chicken fried rice. Now, however, I work just around the corner, so I can make quick lunch trips to pick up some fried rice for me and a to-go order of spicy squid (ojingo bokuum) for the wife.

I love the food, and getting wrapped up in conversation with Nani or her husband is a regular occurrence. They are such great people, offering up great food, that it's hard not to forget how long you had been sitting there. 

The restaurant is located within a larger building with roll up doors over the serving windows. All seating is communal for the building and features rather cramped seating if you have any bit of weight to you at all.

One thing that almost detracted from a 5 star rating is that their hours aren't always consistent. Sometimes, they go on vacation and don't post a return date on their window. It could help to save some disappointment when we're craving good food and conversation!"}
{"text":"My lunch today was so good. I tried the hot version of Bibimbap. It is my favorite! The service is always wonderful, warm, and friendly!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in to the food court where Manna Korean BBQ was located, I was a bit hesitant because of the decor and location. But, after ordering I came to realize that you should never judge a book by its cover. The food was absolutely delicious, and the customer service was outstanding. I will definitely be back to Manna Korean BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"I was the first customer this morning and had the rice cake soup. very flavorful and all the banchans were good too. also I got the galbi soup and squid to go. will be back to try the seafood or the crab soon doo bu next time."}
{"text":"The most legit Korean food. I am so in love with these dishes that it's dangerous. The food court looks sketch but when you peek into her kitchen you'll see the family actually cooking your food. It takes a min to cook but to me, that's a good sign coz it's fresh.  

The only dishes that make me think of my Grandma! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here one afternoon a while back due to its almost 5-star review, however my experience here was not good at all. I came with my sister and a friend and the food court was pretty empty. I went up to place order for me and my sister and the old guy working there asked if we wanted anything to drink and I said water. He went to the fridge and pulled out 3 bottles of water and added those to my bill even though my friend was paying separately and did not even order yet nor agree to water. I felt he tried too hard to up-sell here but then it's a small mom/pop place so I let it go. 

Our food came and not only did everything taste average they completely forgot my tofu soup. When my party was almost done with the food my soup still didn't come. Also halfway through the meal my sister found an old grain of rice in the sauce that they give you for bibimbap, and it couldn't be from us because we only scooped it out once. We took a closer look at the sauce and discovered that the sauce was old because there was already dried crust forming at the rim. We suspected that they reused the sauce that was given to previous customers and took it back. The old lady took one look at it and said 'ew' and immediately got us a new sauce dish with fresh sauce. She apologized but we already finished half of the bibimbap that was mixed with old sauce that most likely contained other people's saliva."}
