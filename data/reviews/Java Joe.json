{"text":"Front staff are pleasant and helpful. Owner never seems to crack a smile. The decor is a very tired throwback to 1991 compared to other coffee shops. Food is okay, but doesn't seem to evolve with time. Too bad Starbucks or Aroma isn't in the plaza. Would not be great for traffic congestion, but would be a definite improvement!"}
{"text":"Will NOT be coming back here. Have been coming here and other locations throughout the years. The number one reason, is the owner/manager. He's an older European male who is the type of boss who is always around watching staff and giving attitude to customers. Even slightly racist. My mother and aunt who are asian have told me numerous stories of him throwing their change at them, speaking in his native tongue about them and about myself. I've heard him doing it. Just very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Ordered a panini without onion - got one with big slices of onion. 

Returned the panini to get another one WITHOUT onion. What do I get? They take out the pieces of onion from the panini and give the panini back to me instead of making a new one.  When I gave it back the owner (I presume) looked incredulous asked if I wanted a new sandwich.  I said yes and he looked so shocked I just walked out.  Have been coming here for three years now but am not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is ok - best part was the super friendly staff. I enjoyed the garden salad I ordered as well, a pleasant surprise to have radish and cauliflower on a salad, mmm. I liked the seating setup too... would be 4 stars but their coffee was disappointing. Ordered a medium roast and it tastes watered down. Wish I walked 3 more minutes to order from Starbucks."}
{"text":"Amazing food, coffee is great but u need to try the killer carrot cake it's the best!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for chicken wrap but its obviously known for its coffee.  The little patio out front is cute and dog friendly.  A nice little cafe in the village."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and enjoy a snack. Not particularly cheap (a slice of banana bread costs about $2.70 after tax), but I'm super cheap. Oh. Free WiFi that doesn't need signing into. How nice."}
{"text":"I have discovered this wonderful oasis where I can sit, enjoy great coffee and a most relaxing atmosphere. I haven't really sampled the fare much but it seems to be quite decent. Oh yes for those of us who are disabled the tables move, everything is on one level, and the washrooms are accessible. They have free wifi of course and a rewards card for hot beverages. They are also open late."}
