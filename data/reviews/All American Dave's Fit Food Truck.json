{"text":"Great for training or staying healthy. It's perfect for people who don't have the time to prepare each meal or the knowledge to portion it out. Also great for people who are too lazy to make there own healthy food. Definitely a good deal if your time and health are valuable to you."}
{"text":"It's not my first time here...  The food is great,  and  all American Daves personality drives it all.   I highly recommend u try this perfectly proportionate healthy meals he is famous for....  O,  and  try the protein shake!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy meals delivered straight to your table. Meals are a little pricey and bland at taste but it's what you gotta do to eat clean. The shakes are where it's at. The walberry shake is delicious, I get one almost everyday."}
{"text":"Tough to find Gluten free, dairy free, organic meals in Vegas. This place is amazing. The AAD burger is the best I've ever had. The green fixins shake is delicious. Overpriced? Maybe by a little but worth it for me. Love this place. Great friendly service. Wish there was one in my hometown."}
{"text":"Just stopped by to grab a shake and some clean food for the day.  Excellent quality and food for clean greens and Protein. Designed to carry energy all day."}
{"text":"Places shouldn't use yelp to advertise and issue a check-in  discount if they don't want you using it. Had a check in discount with no mention that it couldn't be used on curtain items. I have only had the shakes/smoothies here. They are good and worth an extra few dollars for the convenience. For the most part this place is overpriced. I would never eat the food here, because i like my arms and legs and don't want to pay that for food. I guess that's what happens with a monopoly on the market. Overall good shakes, overpriced food and a slight attitude.   Not a fan of people using yelp, issuing check in discounts with no mention that it can't be used on certain items."}
{"text":"Over hyped and over priced. Solid healthy food but my food was overlooked. I think the cute servers are friendly and they apparently have a meal plan that gives 20% discount.   Still it was better than anything in the Rio.    I wish I tried their beef or chicken instead. It looked really good"}
{"text":"Simply put, this is the best food offering of any place in Vegas when it comes to optimal nutrition and supporting a healthy lifestyle. While other restaurants may offer grass fed beef or wild fish, Dave takes into account the ingredient quality, nutrient density, and offers only options that will improve overall health.  Whether you are following the Whole30, strict paleo, gluten-free, or just value what you put in your body, there is simply no other option for 100% natural and sustainable meals in Vegas outside of Whole Foods Town Square, to a certain extent.  As an aside, I don't normally use supplements but even the smoothies are awesome. Tip of the cap, Dave! Keep up the good work..."}
{"text":"This food is amazing!! So healthy and fresh which usually means not a lot of flavor but not here! Dave has put together healthy recipes full of flavor. Be cautious, when something on the menu says \"spicy\" it's definitely hot, so beware."}
