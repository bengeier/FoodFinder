{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. I had the lunch buffet, and as soon as I needed anything, they took care of it immediately. Nice, friendly atmosphere with a clean appearance to the whole place made it an altogether enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"To be a successful Indian restaurant in the Oakland area, rather than just \"another\" Indian restaurant is quite tough. I think Bombay Curry House has a lot of disadvantages as a newcomer. One, there are a lot of other more well established Indian restaurants within the 1-mile radius. Two, Bombay Curry House is located much deeper in South Oakland, away from the hustling and bustling main campus. Three, they're a tad pricier than the other places and their portion size isn't as satisfying. Four, they did not do a good job with advertising. I only know about it because I walk by here daily. 

The food was just average. There was nothing that really stood out to me. I had the chance to try the Chicken Kadai and Chicken Madras. The Chicken Kadai barely had any chicken in it, mostly onions and green peppers. The flavors were a bit too smoky. The Chicken Madras was drenched in a coconut curry sauce, on the sweeter side. Again, the portion was small for the price. They did offer unlimited white rice though. 

My dining experience here was unmemorable. There was nothing to really draw me back. They need to either advertise their specials or vamp up their food a bit in order to lure in the customers. I came here during opening week and it was dreadfully empty. They do have lunch buffet hours, but didn't make it for that. Hopefully other fellow yelpers can shed some light onto that"}
{"text":"Fried rice is a no-go. Poor taste and we had a stomach bug due to this. Chicken manchurian also very bland and the chicken was very chewy. 

Totally disappointment."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I liked this place, but....it's just not that good. Came here with a friend and ordered a mango lassi along with a chicken madras and a chicken kadai. Neither were very memorable, in my opinion. The chicken madras was incredibly heavy on the coconut sauce and contained very little flavor other than coconut. On the other hand, the chicken kadai was better, however, it lacked chicken and was heavy on the onions and peppers. The mango lassi however, was quite good. It had the perfect amount of sweetness and thickness that I prefer in a lassi and the amount given was more than enough (in the best way possible!). 

Because the lassi was so darn filling, I couldn't finish my chicken madras so I asked the waiter to give me a to-go box. The first to-go box I received was broken, so I asked for another. Turns out, this one was broken too. All subsequent to-go boxes were broken, according to the waiter. Really?! How do you not know/see this? I wasted a lot of food just by having to transfer my leftovers not once, not twice, but THREE times. The third to-go container was just too small to fit my leftovers!

As far as prices go, this place was pricey for a not-so-large portion where there was just too little chicken or too much coconut milk. Service was...okay. The waiter seemed indifferent and bored. Not all excited, which was strange since the place had been open for only a day and we were the only customers in sight. 

Bottom line, I won't be eating here again, the food here was not memorable. There are plenty of other Indians spots around Oakland which I would highly recommend over this one."}
