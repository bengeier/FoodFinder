{"text":"The food is really good and the people that work there are GREAT. Didn't get any of their drinks will be coming back to try that... Crepes are Delicious!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of thin pancake versions known as crepes. I've had a few of them in the past only to move on and continue with my way of thinking that there is nothing great to them.   However, my perspective took a turn for the best when I ordered a cheese cake red velvet crepe from this place. I mean, talk about delicacy and deliciousness. This crepe came out looking like a work of art and when my sense of taste got a piece of it I was in paradise. With a side of milk this made for the best meal I've had in the whole day and by far the most exquisite crepe I've had up until then. If you like crepes and want to now have a love and passion for them, visit this place and you'll fall in love all over again."}
{"text":"[Thursday, 6:45pm] Not busy, there were two other couples.  My friends and I ordered 2 Nutella crepes, a Hershey crepe, piña colada smoothie, a vanilla latte, and vanilla frappe. All of us had the same opinion that the crepes were delicious! They were generous with the choice of fruits :)   Friend A liked her piña colada and friend B liked that her vanilla frappe wasn't overly sweet. I KIND OF liked my vanilla latte because it was a bit too sweet, I didn't finish it.  As for the service, they were friendly! And the place was definitely clean and welcoming :) Kind of wish they would use ceramic white plates and silverware because it doesn't feel like the plastic black plates and utensils go with the vibe of the store.  I will be coming back to try their other menu items ;)"}
{"text":"I would more than likely order for delivery than to actually walk in and order again. It's clean and fresh on the inside but it's very hot and it can take people forever to put in their order. It's also pretty crowded and there are quite a few children running around as their parents pay no attention to the PERMANENT sign asking them not to allow this. (must be a chronic problem) As I write this, a mother is allowing her child to drag his chair on the concrete and slam it against the back of my chair while she's half heartedly asking him to \"sientate\".   If you'd like to hang out and eat your dessert, there is music playing at a tolerable level and you may watch them make your crepes as you wait.   The fact that the crepes are good and that I can order this via Uber eats would probably be be the only way I'd spend money here again. I'm not going to dock stars for patron behavior."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try yesterday. I ordered the chicken and pesto crepe, and my husband ordered the caramel one with two fruits.  My crepe was very dry, neither my husband or I could taste the pesto, and the chicken was canned.  It came with a salad, which was the star of the meal. My husbands fruit was canned (strawberries, and peaches) huge disappointment since it's the summer time, where fresh fruit is in season.  I ordered a gluten free crepe, and 10 minutes later they informed me that they were out of the gluten batter (thankfully he returned the extra dollar free, without incident). One of the workers where's a gun proudly on his waistband.  I'll continue my search to find someone who serves fresh fruit."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, great food and drinks , customer service is a little bad but i can look past it because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"The cheesecake crepe was delicious! Has real cheesecake in it so be prepared for an indulgent treat. My husband ordered the salami crepe and enjoyed it as well. It comes with soup. His soup was so yummy, I couldn't stop eating it. I ended up eating the whole bowl for him. :)  The only thing I would change is the experience itself. It is not inviting and warm. Has a cafeteria feel to it and the music is Mexican pop music. It's just not a comfy environment. Oh, and one other thing to expect, these crepes are not the kind you get in France. They are not as eggy and thin. They are more like very thin pancakes."}
{"text":"A really cool, clean, and spacious place to eat. They serve a variety of things; crepes, paninis, smoothies, frappes, milkshakes, iced teas and coffees. The only hesitation are the prices of their crepes. $7."}
{"text":"Enjoyed every bite of the lechera crepe.. friendly staff good ambience and totally Worth it You chose two fruits to go with your crepe & they give you plenty too"}
{"text":"I love this place! The workers are all so friendly and welcoming and really care to your needs. Also, they have many different options including gluten free and they have sandwiches and other food as well definitely my fav crepe place !"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! My daughter and I (she's 2) shared the cream cheese crepe with bananas and strawberries and Hershey. It was delicious and huge. The crepe was nice and warm. Service was great as well. The venue itself was clean and nicely decorated. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I are first time customers from Chicago and will be long time customers when we visit Vegas. Clean location, coffee is great and the food is delicious! Had the ham breakfast panini and Nutella crepe. You definitely should try it out."}
{"text":"What are you hiding? Simple question, is your smoothie all natural? The answer to this question is not \"Yes, well, we add fruit, but we have a syrup.\" That's a \"heck no!\"  I wouldn't actually had cared, but he danced around the answer and that's sketchy so, umm, no thank you. I did get a Nutella crepe and aside from the fact that it was super rubbery it tasted really good. So I'm going to give it a second shot soon. Get your answers straight so you know what story to tell me if I ask something else on my next visit. LOL! See you soon."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot to eat. Very delightful . Presentation of the food is on point and the crepes was a delight to the taste buds. Ordered the breakfast croissant to fill us up"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's very convenient since it's close to my house! The crepes are sweet and satisfying and I love that they have macaroons that are super cheap but still delicious, if I'm not mistaking they sell 6 for 5 dollars!"}
{"text":"So a friend and I saw this place on maps and knew we had to try it since we love crepes and boy were we satisfied!!! We had a cheese cake crepe and a cream cheese crepe and good god do you get what you pay for. the cheesecake crepe had an actual cheesecake slice in it!!! Fruit is cut fresh and the batter is very good. The atmosphere is good as well! Our only complaints are that we had a couple really hard pineapple chunks and that whip cream was a little weak tasting. Other then that we will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"When this place popped up on my Yelp I was so excited, and the last 2 orders I have had with them I have been thoroughly impressed. The crepes (both savory and sweet) are good quality and portions are big. Seeing other reviews, next time I'd like to actually eat there than having them delivered. Either way we will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"We watched this place for a couple of months before they finally opened. I must say, they're pretty awesome! Their crepes are big with lots of fillings! We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to were i get my nails done so i decided to go over after a nail appointment. There was a few people in there so i decided to stay and eat. The atmosphere was nice the had the tv on with sports highlights and a mix on nice trendy music and also acoustic/indie song covers. I ordered a chicken pesto crepe with a side salad it was well portioned and delicious. I had chicken spinach mozzarella cheese and tomatoes with pesto sauce drizzled on the top. It was pretty good the salad was lettuce with fruit on top with i want to say Italian dressing but i could be wrong. My experience with this restaurant was pleasant the staff was laid back and had my order out quick. I did not try the coffee or beverages they offer guess thats a reason to return for more deliciousness. :)"}
{"text":"My mom and I went for sunday brunch and we absolutely loved it! This place is amazing with both great food and great service. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Panini sandwich was terrible. The bread was doughy and barely any meat. I went in hungry and left hungry. Will not return."}
{"text":"Worth the time and money. Way better than places at the strip and away from all foot traffic."}
{"text":"Started off our first visit with a proper dinner. I had the veggie crepe and my Partner had the chicken pesto crepe. They come with a salad or chips, but for $1 more, you can have soup. Partner chose the salad, and I, the soup.  They were super yummy. Fresh and filling, yet light on the tummy. The tomato basil soup was topped with small croutons and fresh shreds of parmesan. It was a perfect compliment to my veggie crepe.  After dinner fare, we decided to be gluttons and went all-in by ordering a Red Velvet Nutella crepe w/bananas & strawberries and a Red Velvet Cream Cheese Crepe w/mangoes and a berry compote (not overly sweet).  Each crepe was filled with the fruit inside and also topped with more fruity goodness. Paired with a latte, it was a perfect end to a refreshing Friday night meal out.  Needless to say, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and its always good. The cajeta crepe and the frapuccino is delish. This place is a must for crepes."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to anything sweet.. this was right down the street from my home and I was craving crepes! Plus we always pass by it when we are driving around.  The place is so bright and airy when you walk inside. There are so many tables and chairs, you don't feel like you have to have someone save a seat. I like that the walls were red and it just felt happy. When we were in, they were also playing old school cartoons. If that doesn't make you happy already, I don't know what will. They have menus on the side of the wall when you go up to order, it is on the side so you have to tilt your head a little. I saw they did have savory crepes, but my husband and I usually like the sweet crepes more.  We ordered the nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries along side vanilla ice cream. We decided to drink arizona tea. All under $10 ! What a steal and a quick sweet tooth fix. You also don't have to purchase water, because they have a complimentary water dispenser, with lemons inside. It was a nice touch.  The crepe was delicious. It was stuffed with bananas and strawberries. You can also choose your types of fruit if you want, you are not limited to what type of fruit you want! They do have the fruit options on the menu. The crepe was soft and chewy and it had the right amount of bite like any crepe should have. I liked that the vanilla ice cream was on the side and it wasn't melting next to the crepe. This place is the right spot if you are looking for the quick fix for a crepe, the value is there and so is the taste!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the reason why I gave 2 star is because I ordered 2 coffee and 2 smoothies. It took them 30 minutes to make it. It wasn't busy when I went there. I was observing them, they were talking while making my order and took time to make my 4 drinks. I would understand if I ordered large order but 4 drinks for 30min? Starbucks can make that order in 15 min. Just saying.."}
{"text":"Easy to find, clean, generous portions and very welcoming staff! I loved this place, they also have gluten free and whole wheat crepes. They added lots of fruit and were generous with the toppings. The fruit was all fresh and yummy! They also serve coffee and paninis!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot we found while on this side of town. The employee who helped us out was very friendly and helpful. It wasn't at all busy so our crepes came out very quickly.  The taste of the crepes was really nice. Will come back another time to try the red velvet batter version.  Decor is nice and subtle, music is good, not too loud.  My only reason for 4 stars not five was the cleanliness of the cooking area, the counters were fine, but trash was on the ground in kitchen area floor and the crepes batter wasn't covered while we were there."}
{"text":"Crepes are meh. I paid $9 for a cheesecake one which all they do is put a tiny cheesecake slice from the store inside the crepe. It's lousy how the crepe is built, and definitely not worth the price. It's all hype."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to crepe because it would usually end up in disappointment but the crepes at Crepe Station are phenomenal! They are very flavorful and delicious. The fruits are always fresh and all of the items on the menu are made to order. All the crepes and drinks I've ordered so far are delicious and there's nothing to complain about. The employees are very friendly as well. The ambiance is very casual and family friendly. The restrooms are very clean which is always a great thing. I will definitely come back in a regular basis and bring anyone I can. I'm so glad this place opened up down the street to my house."}
{"text":"Good coffee!!!! There sandwiches are just right! The crepe's are awesome they come with a lot of fruit! Nice and quite place for breakfast or brunch. Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place I came here about two weeks ago. The coffee that they make here is good and crepes I would definitely come back and try it again :)"}
{"text":"The place looks like it gets busy in the mornings. There crepes are good and they give u 2 different kinds of fruit. Very soft very tasty crepes.                   I will be back next time im in town"}
{"text":"I've had a good experience here takes a while when there is a line of people but very good customer service I enjoy taking my wife and kids to this location."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is great, the workers are really nice and you can see them making the creepes :) Clean, fun environment :D"}
{"text":"Had so much fun coming here for lunch last week. The food was amazing....and oh my....the crepes! Fantastic! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service! Very nice and helpful staff!!!  I ordered the ham and pesto panini. It was perfect!!! My family ordered crepes. They are huge and generous with fillings and toppings. They use fresh fruit and he prices are great!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my  I think I just found my sweet spot-literally. East side has very few gems so I'm glad I finally stumbled into this place. I was craving crepes uncontrollably so figured I'd finally give this place a shot. And I'm glad I did. I kept it simple and ordered and Nutella crepe ($6.99). You get to add on 2 fruits of your choice. There's 8 different sweet crepes to choose from. Wish they had a savory option as well. There's a good selection of hot or cold coffee, frappes, shakes, Italian soda, and dessert! You can even get affogato here!! Yay!!!! I love the fact that it's open everyday (mon-sun) and from 9a-11p. Love that. I mean love that. Come check this place out!! Clean, ample seats, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My very first time here.....And I gotta say I Am Im Love!!!! Def coming back! My Caramel Macchiato is beyond!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for dessert! I always get a dessert crepe but you can also get savory crepes with different types of meats, cheeses, and veggies. They have a large menu with all kinds of things. Even if you don't like crepes, you're still most likely going to find something that suits your taste. I love a basic Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana! If I'm feeling a lil adventurous, I'll add a scoop of ice cream. The crepes are delicious! Thin, but still has bite. They're not stingy with the toppings either. The only thing I don't like about my crepes is that most of the time, the fruit is very, very sour. Some people may not mind, but me personally, I like my fruit ripe and sweet. My boyfriend loves their strawberry milk shakes. It's very creamy and tastes like Nestlé strawberry milk!  I also really love how they have self serve water.  Also, I noticed that this place is high waste. Everything is on plastic plates and you get plastic utensils even if you're dining in! Understandable though because it means less dishes to wash for the staff, but my environmental heart hurts a little. Other than that, staff is great, food is yummy, and I'm glad ESLV finally has a good dessert place that is affordable, clean, and good!"}
{"text":"I found this spot wanting something quick around my folks house! I'm so glad I did! It's in an unassuming location off Nellis and Stewart. We were greeted by all the employees with a warm welcome! It was very clean inside. They do sweet and savoury crepes along with paninis, coffee drinks, and smoothies! We ordered the lechera crepe with strawberries  and  and the breakfast panini with ham. These were  both reaaallllly good! The crepe had my wife and I arguing over who got the last bite!!! I was gentleman of course and treated myself to the last bite! Lol.  The breakfast panini was a perfect complement to the sweet crepe! The bread was crispy the ham and egg cooked perfect. Crepe Station was a very pleasant surprise especially given the location. My only knock on this place is it is a chain. I most the time despise chains but with delicious food and Good service this one definitely gets the nod!"}
{"text":"Great service, great dessert and great place to hang... 100% recommended.. we came all the way from Cali n will come back for sure.... come check it out..."}
{"text":"The place was good. But it could've been better. Their crepes were thick and hard.. not the soft and thin I'm used too. Also wish they put nutella in the inside of the crepe. It was way to loaded with fruits inside with no Nutella."}
{"text":"I had not heard about this place, but I had a Nutella Frappe, and my friend had a Mocha frappe, and they were both really good. The customer service is great, cashier helped us pick a drink, she explained how good they all were. I definitely will be returning to try the Crepes one day. They have a large variety of options in their menu, and their prices are amazing. 100% recommend this for when you want a frappe!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is extremely clean and well lit. Crepes are stuffed to the brim. Randal was extremely helpful. The fruit is bought every day fresh well worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have been here and the one Panini I get keeps getting smaller and smaller. Tje oics on the menu make you thing you are getting a decent sized sandwich but no.. you get bread a very small anount of Pesto sauce not even enough to know it is there 2 tomato slices and what used to be a good amount of Roast Beef today I got 2 thin slices...pitiful. I am leaving now to go get something to eat because paying $7.50 for 2 pieces of toast and Roast Beef flavoring I will just go to In&Out"}
{"text":"AMAzing location for a quick bite or to catch up with friends its lovely an they prices are so reasonable , really good crepes n sandwiches love it here best in eastside of town , highly recommend ..."}
{"text":"In need of a sweet treat, breakfast,coffee, or crepes.... one of our favorite places for Saturday morning or even night ... the food is so yum!"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service!! My daughter didn't exactly like what she had ordered and the very kind owner replaced it. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good..except the crepes are thick and solid not soft and thin like the classic French crepes! Will not return"}
{"text":"Yay! Finally we get something awesome on this side of town. Right when we walked in we felt welcomed and greeted by all the workers. The place is very clean and the decor was like a cafe/coffee shop. The music they play is just at the right volume. Our crepes were huge and  delicious! We will come back!"}
{"text":"love the crepas  it all ways cleaned  The works are very friendly and polite there are great in customer service"}
{"text":"I always get my crepe with bananas/mixed berries with Nutella. The Pina Colada smoothie n Pistachio, Thai Tea shakes are hella bomb and their Veggie Panini is the best."}
{"text":"There's finally a decent dessert place on this side of town, and spoiler alert, it's this place!  This place is clean, and the staff is friendly. As for the crepes, the texture is not too eggy, and the flavor is slightly sweet. Plus, the prices are totally reasonable for the huge portions you get.  As for the toppings, they're super generous, and any place that indulges in my extra, extra whipped cream requests is always a win in my book. I do also like that they use fresh strawberries and bananas. However, I wish they also used fresh whipped cream. It's canned, so overall, the quality is just standard right now.  As for other things that had room for improvement, the servings are monster size. Like big enough to be a meal on its own, with generous heaps of toppings. If that's your thing, you're going to love this place, but personally, I wish the ratio was better so I could have every bite with enough delicious crepe to go around. If you plan on coming here for dessert, plan on bringing a friend to share.  Overall, it's not the best crepes I've ever had, but they're definitely good and you'll struggle to find a better place in this neighborhood that'll satisfy your crepe cravings like Crepe Station."}
