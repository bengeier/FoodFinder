{"text":"Purchase GroupOn and the company didnt honor the coupon.  So I purchased the Kraut Classic - Sauer kraut had burn black pieces. Then tried again with an ice cream cone.. How can you mess up an ice cream cone, right?? Frost biten ice cream!! Horrible experience all around. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but left a little disappointed. The menu is simple, hot dogs or ice cream. No option for polish sausage or brats. I ordered two dogs and after I was done I was left wanting something more. I do have to say though the waffle ice cream sandwich was a great idea. Definitely worth going just for that!"}
{"text":"Not my kind of doggy...  Yays... -CHEAP meal... prices range from $2.75 to $5 for a dog. -CLEAN facility... a few tables & chairs for seating... and the wall is fun to look at. -FRIENDLY service, short wait.  Nays... -The Dog... was thin & small. -The Bun... was not toasty. -The Mango Habanero Sauce... was appealing ...but the Taste was not all that.  SERVICE: ***** [Fast & friendly] AMBIANCE: *** [Diner-like feel, cool wall decor] FOOD:  *** [Just ok] PRICE:  [$2.75, cheap snack]  OVERALL:  *** [3-stars... okay for the neighborhood]  To sum up... Sorry... the look, the size, and the taste matters.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"Oh no..Im too late for my write up about the snappy well seasoned hot dogs with the tasty toppings. (like the Mango Habenera)  I came here the other day for a hot dog fix only to find a sign on the door \"Kitchen Closed\"  and found out it's CLOSED ...for good.    The new owner was there and he came out to talk to me. Said he'll reopen in a few weeks.  New restaurant, new look, new menu ..it will include French cuisine!"}
{"text":"Love this place food is good and owners are nice. Give these folks a try everyone. I think they tromp Pink's Hot Dogs"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is screaming throwback diner with a hipster vibe. They have all kinds of old fashioned posters up which is really cool. My favorite is the junior mint poster.  The service was fast, friendly and featured a wholesome smile. They have dogs, burgers, and ice cream here. They even have mini dogs of all flavors and types. It's definitely a family friendly environment. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"While I love to see new local businesses pop up, I was pretty underwhelmed with this place.  Enticed by a Groupon, I tried not only a simple hot dog with kraut and mustard, but took a bite of their cheeseburgers.  Both were a step up from fast food versions, yet nothing approaching the better ones I've had in town.  The quality of the product just wasn't high, it reminded me of a more mom and pop version of Sonic (which I loathe).  Because they are new I'm trying to give them a break with my rating review, and am willing to try them again because they routinely have Groupon Now certificates available."}
