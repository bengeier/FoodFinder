{"text":"It's tough to screw up pad thai... but when the \"sauce\" is 40% ketchup I guess it's possible.

great portions though!

i've had better"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place quite a bit over the last few years, and I still just don't get it. The food is pretty good. It's not tremendous, but the portions are good, and they do the standard Thai stuff pretty well. I've even had some really great food there on occasion. They always have dinner specials that are great deals, too.

What I really don't understand is the service. There is ALWAYS a new server there. There's always only one, and she is always new, doesn't know the menu, and seems to have zero service experience. I actually have a theory that this is either a training site for wait staff, or they have been filming a terrible reality TV show here for years now that is just waiting to be aired. The restaurant is usually deserted too, though it looks like they do a brisk takeout business.

If you can get past the bizarre service and lack of decor, the food is well worth it. I'll probably be going back."}
{"text":"My first time writing review on yelp. The waitress was a bitch. What a service. Food wise... It's okay.. Cuz we got the $20 for $50 voucher, and at first we thought it was \"spring roll\" instead \"Thai spring roll\""}
{"text":"I just read the other reviews, and I'm not so sure about mine anymore. I thought it was Mirvish Village but they're calling it the Annex. And I've never had food at any other restaurant on Bloor. But apart from those minor drawbacks, my one time experience here was really amazing. 

My friend and I sat on a small table for two right by the open window-wall. We could hear and see everyone walking by on the sidewalk, and that was really cool, very toronto! 

The waitress was probably the friendliest I have ever met anywhere. And the food was really good. We slightly modified our meal from what the menu offered, and it was all ready in time without mistakes.

We both had half our food left over, which we took to go. :) 

ps. I am giving this place a five because I truly loved it, but if you're thinking about going, it wouldn't hurt you to read the other reviews. Also, it's dirt cheap. So if you're looking for dirt cheap, check out their menu!"}
{"text":"I feel like it's pointless to review Thai Spring Roll, because it'll probably be out of business in a few months.  I checked this place out because they give away free stuff.  I should have known better - that's never a good sign.

Aaaanyway...this place is well below your average Thai take-out.  If you're nearby and feel like thai food, there is no reason not to walk a half block East to Thai Basil, or whole block East to Real Thailand, or a block South to Flip Toss and Thai, or maybe Pauper's Pub has better thai food, or you could go to SOBEY'S a few steps away and get a jar of thai curry that would be better...just don't go here.

Aside from the bland, boring food, the staff is incompetent, the decor is cheesy, and they only received a \"conditional pass\" on their last health inspection.  When I asked about it, the waitress said \"Oh, is that still there?  It shouldn't be.\"

\"Why is it a conditional pass?\"

\"I'm not sure.  There was something wrong in the basement.\"

Awesome.  

I can't think of anything unsanitary that might have been in the basement.

Don't go to this restaurant.  You're in the bloody Annex.  It's not like you don't have options.

P.S. I strongly disagree with Angela H. - they have some of the worst spring rolls in the Annex"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Your usual Thai pad thai and curry coconut chicken on rice fare.  I enjoyed it.  Portions were a good size and ambience is not noisy like Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"I had yellow curry pad thai my friend had regular pad thai.  I did notice in the ingredients that was listed for pad thai included ketchup!  

Clean, TV playing sports in the back, nothing spectacular.  You could bring a date here."}
{"text":"Ok food and prices, extremely slow service."}
{"text":"Actually wrote this in the wrong \"Thai Spring Roll\", there are so many. But this is the one I went to.

Went there for a friend's birthday today. The food was really good and authentic. The portions were generous. We had many of the dishes on the menu.

However the environment and ambiance wasn't that great or else this place would be 5 stars."}

{"text":"I visited last night: the long and the short of it?

Ambiance: two stars.  It's nice-looking, but the interior looks very 'cold' on a November night - dim and comfortless.  Still, except for the ugly tiled floor, the finishes & furniture aren't bad.  

Bathrooms: 1 star.  You have to go down a service hallway to the stairs, then down into a low, low-ceilinged basement that smelled like sewer last night.  The washroom itself really needs a new coat of paint, as the door & switchplate are grubby.  Still, they are clean, if not irreproachably so.

Service: 3 stars.  Our server went around at a desultory pace and didn't refill water glasses, but did check in to see how we were.  They were having trouble with their computer system, so I wasn't able to pay with a card.  Also, I asked how far north they deliver and never got an answer.  Still, our server wasn't rude or anything, and I got the feeling she was helpful.  Trust me.

Food: 5 stars.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  This comes a close second to my favourite Thai place in Toronto.  The pad thai was a proper colour, not drowning in grease, and came with peanuts, green onions, and bean sprouts.  The sauce was wonderful, as was the noodle texture.  Our red curry was nutty and creamy and complex, filled with bamboo shoots, kaffir lime leaves, crisp veggies ,and chunks of lemongrass.  We hunted through it for every last shred of food.   Only minor complaint here: we ordered steamed rice and got a tiny, tiny bowl for the two of us that couldn't begin to absorb all the curried goodness.  

They almost lost me at the washrooms, but they gained it back with that curry.  I can't give the restaurant location more than three stars in good conscience, but the food is easily worth four or five stars.  If I were in the area, I would get disgusting amounts of delivery."}
{"text":"Thai Spring Roll definitely muddled things up by offering groupon coupons. 

I've been here a few times 2-3 years ago and probably would have given it a 3 star prior to recent experiences!

This place is usually empty with OK-ish food. It's a decent option for a quick meal but given all the selection in the Annex, this place doesn't get a lot of business. In fact, I'm surprised they have remained open. It's one of those places that always has only 1-2 tables of diners.

They offered a $20 for $50 of food/drink deal on groupon and this really increased their patron numbers by crazy amounts. It was at capacity the first time I went and the food was served SO SLOW. We didn't get our meal until 1.5 hours after ordering. In the meantime, I got slightly drunk (at least they were bringing the wine out quickly enough) so I didn't mind waiting.

The mango salad is good and my green curry with prawns was OK too. Sticky rice was not cooked right (it's supposed to be sticky, not HARD). I could have broken someone's windshield with that clump of rice.

Funny enough, I returned a second time with another friend who wanted to use his groupon coupon. The second time we arrived, they had removed their regular menu (which was huge) and replaced it with a plastic sheet with only 10-12 dish selections.  The restaurant only had 4 tables dining at this time, but we still had to wait an hour for the food to arrive. 

My mango chicken dish was terrible - tasted like they poured bottled sweet & sour sauce over some chicken pieces, mango and mini corncobs. It was like a microwavable ready-meal of non-goodness.

We were also informed that they had run out of chopsticks. Wow. Awesome. They have the plastic/reusable kind there. Can't they wash some?

Ya, groupon fail."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and had a good experience!

Food is good and prices are decent. There seemed to be only one waitress for the whole restaurant but even then, the service wasn't too slow.

Portions are a fair size and there's enough space in between tables.

I'll definitely be coming back :)"}
