{"text":"I'll give it one star because the food was edible and they gave good sized portion, however I was not impressed by the taste of the food at all. I ordered the chicken pad thai, spicy eggplant and coconut sticky rice. For the price, i expected the food to be a lot better. If you want real Thai food, check out jatujak..... Yummmmmmmmm.."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business, especially considering the area it's in?  Horrible service!  The staff barely understand English and even when you point to the item on the menu you want, they still bring out the wrong thing!  And, to top it off, the food takes forever to come out!  My husband and I ordered spring rolls (15 mins to come out and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Staff just standing around taking in their language).  By the 40 minute mark, we got up and paid for our spring rolls and told them to cancel the pad thai and chicken dish we ordered as we ordered it 40 minutes ago!!! Not the first time this has happened, but this is the last time we'll be here.  We now frequent a much better thai restaurant with a nicer/cleaner atmosphere, friendly staff that understand your order, and cooks that know how to make thai food and in a reasonable amount of time even when it's busy... That restaurant is Riz (the location on Avenue Road south of Eg).    This Thai One On place is a joke !  Close down your restaurant already!"}
{"text":"i really love a good thai food place and am very familiar with malaysian style thai food and maybe thats why it was a pure disappointment. Didnt find any other interesting delivery places in the borough one night and decided to order this. Got the lamb in green curry sauce, fried rice and spring rolls. cost me about $36 (a bit too high compared to other places around) and the food was not appetizing at all. the lamb was not well cooked and the fried rice was not the greatest either. maybe its just not my kinda thing but rest assured im not eating here again"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here on numerous occasions and have never had a problem.  Food is always hot and tasty and reasonably priced.  The girls who take your orders, etc. can be a bit more friendlier but other than that it's good."}
{"text":"I strongly disagree with the \"good delivery service\" we ordered hour and a half ago and we've called to check and all they had to say was the driver would be there in a few minutes after waiting for all that time..very disappointed and will not order from them again p.s the guy on the phone was not helpfull and had me on hold for 15mins to figure out my order"}
{"text":"Consistency good food! Prepared quickly, delivered quickly. I personally recommend the Devil's beef, basil beef, or yellow curry with chicken. Great comfort food!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times for dinner. Both for take out and eat in. The food is excellent, the portion sizes are large as well. The staff are friendly and polite. Sometimes the service is a bit slow, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering from Thai One On. I ordered food online at 6:23pm and got a call at 6:32pm from the store asking if it was okay that my food be delivered between 8-8:15pm. That's insane! almost 2 hours for my order to arrive when the website says it would be delivered in 45-60 minutes. The man on the phone said they only had 1 driver and my location was \"far\". I don't understand how they only have 1 driver during peak hours. Their website also states that they deliver across the GTA, so it's ridiculous that my location would be used as an excuse. I asked for a refund and he gave me a number to call (apparently the actual stores can't issue refunds?). Long story short, I'm now out $53.00 and hungry. Horrible and completely unacceptable experience. No one even apologized. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."}
{"text":"Took 1.5 hours to deliver for the worst ginger \"beef\" I have ever had. Gets one star as the delivery man was smiley."}
{"text":"Red Thai Curry is completely unauthentic, not even close. Do puts carrots and broccoli in Thai curry? Come on..."}
{"text":"We have been customers here for some time. The last several times the food quality was terrible, food stickers in our noodles, no sauces etc. We politely explained each time just to make them aware......no one cared. At all. Done with this place and I do not suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"I ordered a tomyum soup and an order of thai springrolls. The springrolls were average, but the soup was a horrendous assault to thai cuisine.   The best way to describe the tomyum soup I had is .... stir fry with some hot water and curry paste. There was not a shred of authentic thai taste or ingredient in there. The flavour was very flat, and tasted exactly like the curry pastes that you can get from any super market, well that, and some weird stir fry taste. The veggies in the soup were all common ingredients for a stir fry: shredded carrots, chinese mushroom, and LOTS AND LOTS of flavourless cabage. Since when is there cabage in a tom yum soup? And no, there was no shrimp or seafood in sight (I did not order the vegetarian version). Not only was the soup filled with cheap, filler veggies, they were also tasteless - they were probably previously used to make a vegetable stock. I've had much better tasting and authentic tomyum soup from Springrolls, which is a miracle as Springrolls is not really a beacon for authenticity. It is a \"fusion\" restaurant after all.  You may want to think twice before purchasing a GROUPON to this place. The only waiter for the day (Saturday around noon, 5 filled tables), asked everyone, as soon as they came in, whether they were there with a coupon. This indicates to me that they have some kind of \"special\" menu for groupon users, a.k.a. leftover crap that should be discounted anyway. Considering their cheaping out on the \"tomyum\" soup, this is more than likely.  Service was ok. There was one waiter for all the tables. She wasn't rude and wasn't overly friendly either. I didn't like the fact that she shoved a check onto my table 15 minutes after my food arrived - I hadn't asked for it and was not done eating at that time. I guess they wanted me to clear out so that the booth can go to a larger party? But the place wasn't even full... Anyway, service and decor are passable, it's the food that's going to deterr me from ever going back there, or recommending the place to anybody.  BTW, the bathroom was downstairs and the stalls were ridiculously small. I am 5 foot 2 and weigh around 105 pounds. I could barely fit in there. If you're an average  sized or larger adult, you might find them extremely crammed."}
{"text":"The pad thai was pretty good, but the food took TWO HOURS to arrive. The curry dishes were quite expensive and did not include rice, which was very disappointing. When we called to inquire about our late order, the staff offered no form of compensation and were quite rude."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!  The last time I have been here was about 2 yrs ago.  Food was tolerable then but today's experience was so bad that I felt nauseated half way into the meal.    The Thai chicken wings (appetizer) had no flavour. It was just badly fried in old oil.  The sauce it came with was basically sugar melted in red colouring.  One bite and I was regretting ordering it.   The red beef curry with pineapple was a disaster!  Beef was extremely dry.  My jaw was sore from chewing two pieces of this not so flavourful beef (don't ask why I even gone for the second piece).   The pineapple in the curry was not fresh and looked brown and felt soggy when I touched it with my fork.    Pad thai that my friend had was so sour that they should have handed out Gaviscon as a side dish.    All in all, this is the worst restaurant experience ever.  I will never step back into this place again!"}
{"text":"Slow service and an overwhelmed kitchen. We cancelled 1/2 our order after waiting for an hour.  They did deliver a pad Thai. Which was over seasoned and a congealed mass of rice noodles."}
{"text":"Do NOT order from here. We waited an hour and 45mins for the food to come when they said it would only take 40mins to an hour. The food was lukewarm and they didn't offer a discount. I am NEVER going to order from her again and I'm going to tell EVERYONE I know not to do so either."}
{"text":"Order from this restaurant again is because it's closed by. And once again disppointed. Ordered a chicken pad Thai but to found out they gave me beef pad Thai when I got back to work"}
{"text":"Good food can't make up for bad service. Was on Avenue the other day with a friend decided on this place for dinner. BIG MISTAKE. I walked in and sat down, it was pretty empty. Was looking at the menu then was informed I was looking at a takeout menu she brought the regular menu. Was looking at goat curry which was $2 more on the dine in menu. Then on top of that for rice or noodles they were charging another $2.  So with all that my bill is at $17+tax. My curry comes, it was good but my noodles didn't waited, and ask 5 minutes later. The sever forgot, would have been nice if she wrote it down eh? I canceled it, In the end she charged me the take out price but I am never coming back here again and would never recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible.   Ordered a vegetable pad thai and a mango smoothie cause I wanted to play it safe but it was just terrible. The taste was so off, smelled funny and the presentation was like I was eating someone's leftovers. Mango smoothie also had a weird taste.   Please do yourself a favor and just go to Thai Express if you want something close by. If not, jatukjak is also worth the travel."}
{"text":"Unbelievably disgusted by their false advertisement - Stouffville thai one under new management.  When I had called to order for pick up, the owner had mentioned their discounted deals on website are not valid under the new management.  But, He offered me a special rate of discount .  And he suggested to give more discounts when I reached the store for my meals.  Since he offered a discount, I orderd more items.But When I got there, he did not live up to his promise!  I was very insulted and disappointed by his dirty tactic and false advertising just to get me to purchase more food items.  Not to mention, the food tasted extremely horrible! Beef was burned to point where they covered it with breadcrumbs cover it and fried on top of that with excess of ketchup!  The chicken and beef tasted the same.  We dumped 90% of the food.  Overall, below avg food+false strategy= lost a valuable customer and potential customers!   Thank you."}
{"text":"Not good. Ordered spring rolls, basil beef and pad Thai. The spring rolls tasted burnt and came without plum sauce (I ordered online), the beef was overcooked and the \"sauce\" was oily and thin liquid that leaked everywhere. The pad Thai was very sweet and almost tasted like ketchup."}
{"text":"Terrible fresh rolls. Honestly the worst thai food I've eaten. Dipping sauce was sickeningly sweet and synthetic tasting. Had shrimp satay. Shrimp were edible, didn't like peanut sauce. Super disappointed :("}
{"text":"love this place! its my new go to Thai restaurant! the food is always hot and fresh and yummy. the portions are really large too and make for great leftovers the next day!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - that part was fine. Foodwise though -   Salad rolls not very tight and no fish sauce.  Beef satay cooked to shoe leather consistency and cold.  Shrimp pad thai - shrimp somewhat fishy, pad thai somewhat ketchup-y.  Best of the 3 was the salad rolls.  I won't order from there again."}
{"text":"Ate here twice. Once in restaurant and once ordered online.   The food is terribly meh. DO NOT get the \"Oodles of Noodles\", its terribly oily and lacks zip. The spring rolls I ordered were also not fried to golden brown, there were a sickly beige undercooked colour.  Overall, waaay too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"We didn't make it past soup and salad! The mango salad was mediocre and the thai one hot and sour soup just looked like a blended protein shake. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Part of my order was missing. There were hard inedible bits in Some of the dishes. Everything was WAY too Sweet. Large lumps of chicken fat. No balance to the flavours at all. Greatly overpriced considering the quality. This is like the Mcdonalds of Thai food. Dont bother and never trust the Just-eat rating."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to note that I've only gotten delivery from here. So, my rating doesn't reflect ambiance, cleanliness, etc.   Second, I have a key standard of judgement for thai food: does it make me feel sick immediately after eating it. Thai food is insanely delicious, but it's loaded with sugar, salt, and oil, so chances are you won't feel amazing and rejuvenated. But, some places through an epic combination of old oil, way too much oil, and likely some additives, make me feel downright like I don't want to live. Thai one on did NOT make me feel that way - test 1 passed!  Now on with the review! I've tried a few different dishes - the mango tofu, basil tofu, veg pad thai (NOTE: they use fish sauce! sacre bleu!), veg spring rolls, and a basil noodle dish. All were DELICIOUS. Portions were standard size for thai.   Whenever I get delivery - which has been shockingly often of late - it's been from here!"}
{"text":"These guys used to be our go-to delivery place, but never again. Recently we ordered 3 pad thais, paid online, and only 2 showed up. We called them and a manager said they were too busy to send the missing food(!?). He said he'd add a note to our phone number so that we could get credited for the $12 we spent, and also a discount next time.   Less than a week later, we figured we'd use the credit. We called and they said there was no note on our account, so there was nothing we could do. They didn't even apologize. Like Amelia J wrote in her review, they said a higher-up would call us the next day, and of course that never happened in our case either. I guess they figured it was in their interest to withhold that $12 reimbursement and lose a house full of regular customers."}
{"text":"Thai One On, located in an otherwise non-descript strip mall near Don Mills and York Mills, produces some fighty fine eats!   I'm especially fond of their veggie tom yum soup. I often order this dish as a small meal or a tie-over and Thai One On always uses hearty, fresh ingredients. Keeps me coming back. Their veg red curry is also very tasty and flavourful, although medirm heat is more like mild but tasty nonetheless...  A good place to grab a nice bite to eat to go but they do have a few tables for eating in.  Service has always been quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Worst thai food ever... and the service was the poorest I have ever experienced in Toronto.  Felt like a bunch of morons are running this show, and the server lady was the rudest one ever met...  Will never go back, even if they offer free food..."}
{"text":"WARNING, WARNING !! ( had to put one star because it wouldn't let me put ZERO STARS) Absolutely NO customer service . Ordered from them , the food was decent , the next time we ordered they got our address wrong ... Yelled at Us about it on the phone .. Brought us cold food  30 minutes late AND forgot one of our orders . When we called to explain what had happened they denied having our address on file from a previous order and blamed us for the address mix up and wouldn't comp ANYTHING . Instead of coming up with a solution they simply accepted the fact we will NEVER be ordering from them again. Not worth the risk of ruining your night from food arriving late and incomplete and POOR POOR customer service !"}
{"text":"Red Mango on Lesmill (north of the Tim Hortons plaza) is MUCH better for a bit less money. Owners are also SOOO nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Do not order classic pad thai....placed order for delivery and as soon as I opened the bag the smell was very fishy....tried a shrimp and it tasted off.  I called and spoke to someone on the phone who supposedly spoke to the manager and they just brushed me off... very poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here tonight for a quick take-out meal that would be acceptable to eat while watching playoff hockey.  After we ordered it took only 10 minutes for our food to be prepared, which is nice since the place is pretty small and not much to look at inside.  There are a couple of small tables, however I don't see many people staying in to eat here.  There was a number of counter staff on duty, but it seemed like there were too many as one guy was entertaining himself with his iphone the whole time we were waiting.  Prices are pretty reasonable and they do have an extensive amount of menu options.  I had the chicken Pad Thai, which was pretty tasty and had plenty of meat added.  I agree with a previous reviewer, this meal is big enough to be split into two as I couldn't finish it!  We also grabbed the coconut rice as a side and it was delicious, worth a try for sure!    If you're in this area, I'd say this place is great for a quick take-out meal or try the delivery if you don't feel like going out.  Relatively tasty food for a good price if you're looking for something different from pizza and other fast food."}
{"text":"Average thai food at slightly above average prices. Atmosphere is mediocre, but tolerable if you are hungry. Open later than most \"fast eating\" restaurants in the area. Had glass noodle stir fry for $13. Tasty and filling."}
{"text":"I 've been there once and definitively coming back next time I'm in Stoufville. Place is small but it is welcoming. I had chicken and steamed vegetables, it was very good. Husband had pad thai also had great comments about it. Not expensive for a good tasty food."}
{"text":"Poor time management.  Ordered food and they told me 30 mins, I get there at the given time and the girl out front yells me 5 mins, about 20 mins after she tells me that, I find out that they're just starting to make it as I was going to cancel the order.  Finally an hour after I ordered I got the food. While I was there, every person that called in an order they told 30 mins.  Food tastes average, not the best taste."}
{"text":"I had the mango chicken lunch special it was delicious and a huge portion for under 10 bucks I will be back the plate was also arranged beautifully really nice place and really good food and affordable"}
{"text":"It's like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. The green mango salad is fantastic, and other dishes I've tried here are good, but don't expect the slightest courtesy and don't you dare ask any questions.   Food 3 to 4 Service 1 to 2  Overall rating: No soup for you Thai One On  note: there has been the very rare occasion where my family and I were treated decently. But by and large this is not the case."}
{"text":"Can you do negative 5 stars don't give these people your business eat a hot dog better safer and way way more bang for your buck"}
{"text":"Ordered food to be delivered twice and both times they forgot the order and until I made the call 1.5 hour later, I didn't even know the food wasn't on its way. Terrible service. I will never order food from here again."}
{"text":"Tried this on just-eat a while ago, despite the poor reviews. I'd thought I'd give it a try. Well... bad choice! Haha.  Settled for the Chicken Pad Thai. It was disappointing. The portion was tiny for dinner and well, not worth the price. No vegetables present at all, with the exception of maybe 5-7 tiny squares of tofu with the chicken and noodles. Tasted no where near to pad thai but at least it lacked the ketchup-y taste.  I'll pass next time and actually adhere to reviews. Kudos to the delivery man though, he was very nice."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them a few times and the food was always delivered hot and on time. I've had the Thai green curry which was really good but a little too sweet for my taste, the Tom yum was delicious and so was the coconut rice."}
{"text":"So I just ordered online from here and paid for a Curry Pad Thai with seafood. This is definitely not curry. It's not even yellow. Tastes like you mixed the regular pad thai sauce with curry and it turned into something that tastes like BBQ sauce.   Not impressed. Will not be ordering from here from now on."}
{"text":"I am sure glad I did not look at the reviews before coming to this place. It was raining outside and I was in the mood for Thai food, so my boyfriend and I saw this place and decided to try it out. The place was on the expensive side $12-14 per entree, but we decided to stick with it. We ordered the Beef Devil and Green Vegetarian Curry. The Beef Devil was actually really good and it had a nice kick to it was well. The dish was massive and there was 1/4 of it left because we got full. The Green Curry was just OK. It's hard to beat he Green Curry from Green Basil in the Beaches. Food portions are huge, so you do get your money's worth. I may come here again if I had a coupon deal, but overall, I didn't think it was that bad."}
{"text":"I went there once and had the mango salad, it was amazing! The service was average, the restaurant is beautiful; but the menu's are falling apart! They need to invest in some new menu's instead of menu's held together by tape. But I went there thinking I didn't like Thai food and came out loving it!"}
{"text":"Decided to order delivery due to good reviews on just eat, which ended up being a horrible idea. The food took almost two hours despite multiple phone calls. When the driver came, he threw the food in our face and left without saying a word. We ordered chicken skewers and a shrimp pad Thai. The skewers were cold, and did not taste good alone. The only thing that made them palatable was the peanut sauce, and the shrimp pad Thai was disappointing to say the least. My boyfriend described the taste by saying it was similar to vomit."}
{"text":"I think this place is not bad,  but even Thai Express is better than this. The good thing is that it is not expensive, but it is not good. The taste gets boring so easily and it can be heavy for your stomach. I would search a better place."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the food at 4 of their locations and never been disappointed with the meals. their classic Chicken Pad Thai and most of their curries are great. the coconut rice is fantastic (not the coconut rice meal - the side dish). Good protion sized vs price.   The staff at the one in Stouffville seems lost, maybe it was a new waitress we had but she was clueless."}
{"text":"I ordered from just-eat.ca for the second time with this place.  The first time my order came about 10 minutes late which was fine but the second time my order came 2 HOURS LATE.  I have never been so pissed as I have today.  I even gave them another 20 minutes to deliver my food before giving them a call.  Upon the call, I was told the driver left and its on the way.  Another 30 minutes pass and by then I was fuming and starving.  I was told that they would give the driver a call and will call me back.  I demanded that they do something about it since its been 1:45 minutes since the time I called to make the delivery.  There goes another 10 minutes, no phone call back with the driver arriving another 10 minutes later.  He hands me the receipt to sign for the credit card and I told him to wait while I give the place a call again.  They put me on hold for 5 minutes and told me that they  are sorry for the inconvenience and that they are very busy today and they will give a free pad thai on the next visit.  What the hell kind of service is this?! I can't believe how they handled the whole process by just offering a damn free pad thai while I wait for 2 hours.  The food is good but the overall service is HORRIBLE.  For sure, I will NOT order from this place ever again."}
{"text":"this is my go to thai food when i'm not really thinking bout it being so great. my usual is beef curry fried rice and golden curry or green curry. the fried rice is super oily and if you get it delivered to your place the rice at the bottom of the container is more oily than the top to make sure you mix it well. the curry on the other hand is thick with coconut cream and is more sweet than spicy. i always make the request to make the rice less oily and the curry more spicy. **if you want it delivered you have to make a purchase of $20 or more other wise its dine-in or pick up"}
{"text":"insult to thai cuisine!!! the curry beef fried rice was just so greasy and the golden curry was too sweet"}
{"text":"Horrible! Worst pad thai I've ever had! The curry had broccoli which is not Thai! The beef was shoe leather! So expensive and a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Thai One On has the potential to be a go to for all thing Thai in the east end. Unfortunately it's flaws cannot be ignored.  When ordering, I'd recommend the Curry Pad Thai and Thai Red Curry. The curry pad Thai is amazing. Best I've had. Surprisingly their calamari is quite good too.  I've only ever ordered from Thai One On for delivery. In every case, the delivery time took forever. On one occasion, I waited over an hour.   It's hit and miss in terms of what you order so review more posts to see what's popular."}
{"text":"Great chain spot for Thai in Pickering. This location is small, but always clean and the staff are consistently friendly and knowledgeable - whether you're eating in or ordering takeout over the phone. Quick note on takeout: if they say something will be ready in fifteen minutes, they actually mean it!  My go-to order is usually the Thai One One chicken fried rice and whatever meat dish they have on special. I've yet to be disappointed with any of them. I particularly like the green curry chicken, which is spicy and delicious!  The portions are large, as some other reviewers mentioned, so they're definitely meant for sharing. An order of rice with one meat dish is enough for my husband and I, with plenty leftover for lunch the next day.  Their appetizers are good too, although they're a bit overpriced for what you get. I got the samosas once, and they were tasty, but there were only three small ones. I thought their apps would be somewhat suitable for sharing (much like their mains) but it didn't quite turn out like that.  Regardless, this is a good place when you have a sudden Thai craving in the east end."}
{"text":"Went there with the wife for dinner. The place looked closed with all the lights off and nobody inside. Only the open sign made me try to open the front door.   Once inside the owner turned on some lights and we sat down in a booth. Not sure what was going on with the booth but there was missing padding and i ended up sitting on boards.   We looked through the menu and i made a joke to my wife about them labelling the noodle dishes as Asian Pasta, i really should have started to worry at that point.   The Spring rolls came out and they were ok. Its is when the Pad Thai came out that the night took a turn for a nasty worse. The sauce tasted of tomatoes and vinegar, being really hungry I tried to ignore it but could not. Looking across the table at my wife who was also making a nasty face about the Pad Thai I tried to get the attention of the owner who rather then come over started to print our bill.   When i brought him the two plates of Pad Thai and asked why it tastes like acidic he told me that was how they make it in Thailand.   We still had to pay for the disgusting Pad Thai but he did give us a 15% discount.   This is my last trip here"}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai is delicious! Convenient, great customer service, offer a discount to my company and first option for me for take-out."}
{"text":"Their hours of operation clearly mention open till 10:30pm but when we showed up at 9:40pm they refused service and said they can do take out only. We used to frequent this place alot but I'm not impressed with this lack of customer service. Not returning."}
{"text":"This is a decent fast-food style Thai take-out joint. The taste is okay. It's good value for money too. But having two pretty good alternatives nearby Kub Khao and Jatujak I would probably not be in a hurry to return back very soon. Still a decent spot."}
{"text":"Chicken fried rice only if you are hungry. Prices seem high. Soup not what I expected."}
{"text":"Took 1.5 hours for delivery and the order was wrong. This isn't the first they've taken over an hour for delivery. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was unable to give a 0 star review but this restaurant truly deserves it. I have never written a review over a restaurant but this restaurant's customer service is horrifying.  Absolutely horrible customer service and I advise you all to stay away from this location. I placed my order at 11:35am online and my food arrived at 2:68pm. I called the location and they promised me that my food would be hot when it arrived. My food eventually came and it was so cold. I called the location with their driver at my front door and they refused to give me a discount on the cold food.  The man over the phone said he would contact his manager and get back to me. He called me back and told me that the best he could do on a $100 order was 20% off. I informed them that I was not satisfied because my food was COLD. It was not even warm.  He refused to give me anymore of a discount. He told me he would give me a call back once he spoke to his manager once again. When he called me back he informed me that the driver would be coming back to pick up the food.  I have ordered many many times from the avenue road location and NEVER have I experience such horrible customer service.  I also requested to speak to the manager during our 5 back and forth phone calls and I was declined to do so every single time. I had to speak to the poor middle man who had no control over his situation.  Very disappointed. Will never order from here again. STAY AWAY. Spend your money with a business who actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"I have tried the pad thai both for delivery and at the restaurant. It had a very dry texture to it. Also, the hot and sour soup had a very distinct taste. Too many clashing ingredients were used which ruined the balance. Although it was a filling portion, I was not satisfied with the taste and texture that I had had else where.  This is my personal rating of the food there. In conclusion, I would not recommend eating at this thai restaurant."}
{"text":"My recommendation is don't tie one on at Thai One On.     I called in for delivery as for a world class city, few places seem to be open or deliver after 10pm.  I ordered Hot & Sour Soup, Thai spring rolls, Beef Curry Pad Thai.  The Hot & Sour had a nice heat, but was not sour or any other taste for that matter.  No surprise as I continue to find a good H&S north of Chinatown.  Spring Rolls we're equally bland and the Pad Thai mediocre at best.  It is one of those meals you end up saying \"well it was food\" but beyond that nothing."}
{"text":"The establishment is  very disorganized  and the servers are not very warm and dont seem to care about the customer. A few weeks ago, i ordered oniine and waited and waited for my food. I finally called them and they rudely told met hat they never received my order and that they are closed for the night. I argued that I had been waiting for over an hour and had already paid for the meal. They finally delivered....but there was no apology or  cookie on the house for the inconvenience, you know? A  couple other experiences were also frustrating. I had called in for a large order and when i checked I noticed they forgot to give me a signature sauce to complete a dish. They told me that sauce did not come with the meal and if i wanted it i had to pay extra. I found a menu and read the printed text which stated that the sauce was indeed included to complete the dish. I was finally given a tiny cup of sauce only to have to stop at Metro and buy something similar for the rest of the family. For my last example is not specifically targeted towards this restaurant, but all restaurants. I had ordered a meal for one and was less than a dollar off from a free delivery. I was really shocked. I mean 80 cents.....REALLY? It was freezing cold, I was ill and did not have my car.And it was literally a 2 minute drive from the restaurant to my home.   I tried to explain my situation and kept replying \" all of this for 80 cents? Instead of being sympathetic they kept telling me to oder an appetizer instead . With tax added up to another 10 bucks.  I had no choice but to get them to deliver me the food and pay an extra 3 $ for the 2 minute delivery drive.   Long story shirt. good food but is it worth the headache? Maybe you will have better luck!"}
{"text":"Thai One is like fast food thai - portion is big and prepare quickly. Usually in 10 mins or less. The pad thai is okay here and the glass noodle is another good item.

{"text":"Love this place. The red and green curry are delicious. Portions are huge! The young guy that works most evenings is a sweet heart. Always great service."}
{"text":"Food was ok, arrived hot and reasonably good.    I ordered it online (no delivery charge if you order greater than 20$).  I always tip the delivery guy, but as soon as this one arrived, before he even handed me the food or the bill to sign, he said \"you still need to pay the delivery charge\" and when I said that the website said it was included he responded \"well, its up to you.\"  I always tip, and well, but someone trying to trick me into thinking its a \"delivery charge\" that I hadn't paid yet vs a tip is really not okay."}
{"text":"I drop by here once and a while to have the lunch special, I usually have green curry in coconut rice and am never disappointed. The staff here is friendly and the food is usually good. It's almost always empty everytime I drop by so not sure how they are during rush times but the lunch specials are affordable and tasty!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mall cafeteria Chinese type food. Good for quick eats, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, as I got delivery from here often.  Usually takes an hour, give or take ten minutes.  Then, one night, it took two hours.  It wasn't a prime-time.  Around 9:15 pm on a Sunday night, not unusual timing for me.   I figured it'd arrive around 10:15, I'd eat, and be in bed by 11.  I was wrong.  Around 10:25, I called Thai One On and asked about my delivery.  \"It'll be there soon,\" was all I was told.  10:45 pm I called back.  \"Yeah the guy is close,\" I was told.    Everytime I would phone, no one would really answer me.  I ordered through JustEat, usually embedded in your confirmation email is a link to see the real-time of when the driver will be there.  It said 10:15 pm.  It was now nearing on 11 pm.  I wanted to be in bed.  I was hungry.  I was confused.  I just wanted answers.  When my food arrived past 11:15, I called back one final time and the guy said someone from head management would be calling me the next day before 4 pm.  The next day came and went.  I emailed JustEat and asked what I should do.  (This service by the way was great, I mean, it wasn't their fault they are a middle man, but their customer service is really good.  You can live chat with an agent which is great because I could do it from my desk at work which still doing my work)  They called Thai One On for me and was told someone from management would phone me the next day.  The next day: came. Went.  I emailed JustEat and told them the issue and finally someone from Thai One On called me.  I don't even know if the guy was speaking English, every now and again a word would come out that sounded like a word I recognized, but basically he was talking so fast with such a strong accent I have no idea what the agreement or outcome was.  I never got answers.  I would have been happy with \"sorry\".  At the end he finally said he would text me a code I could use on their personal website for 25% off.  I never heard from him again.    I liked the food, but I can't handle the run around."}
{"text":"Really slow delivery and almost no chicken in the three dishes we ordered. The green thai curry is nicely flavored and really creamy but that was the high point of an otherwise bland fast food thai experience."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with a groupon deal.  I don't recommend it.   The place: it had rained that day and they told me the bathroom was flooded when I wanted to wash my hands.   The service: The server didn't bring PLATES until I asked her to, just the dishes my friend and I had ordered and cutlery. She was friendly, but a smile can only go so far...  The food: The spring rolls sucked. They had a terrible flavour and too much batter. I think they were using old bean sprouts, or perhaps the seasoning was just off, I don't know they were WRONG.  We had phad thai, and green curry chicken and beef in oyster sauce. The beef was the best one and it was only a 4 out of 10, seasoning was fine but the beef was WAY overdone.  The green curry made my friend nauseous, it lacked flavour and had a bit of a slimy constancy.   Overall: Thai one on  was the same quality as Thai food at a mall food court (or worse) but instead of paying $10 for a combo plate of three things, our meal came to $57. Thank goodness i had the groupon and saved $15. Still, even with a savings it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Have consistently had issues in the few interactions with this place. Recently ordered delivery at 6:50pm and food arrived at 9:00pm. This isn't entirely on them as they use JustEat, but a restaurant ultimately has to be accountable for which delivery service they choose to contract.  Re: the food that was delivered... items that are included on the menu were missing. Portions are small considering the price and the little things like including steamed rice with an order of $16.99 cashew chicken (that was mostly flavorless) is not taken into account. Instead, they will charge you an additional $3.99 for the rice.  Save yourself the trouble and find a Thai place that will provide you a better experience and similar (if not better) dishes in the $10 range."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT. THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS.  Ordered for take out from their online location. Apparently not all items are available at all locations. This is not advertised on their website.  For example, smoothies are not available at the pickering location. Not being blessed with ESP, I ordered a smoothie. I quickly found out that what is also not available from the Pickering location is a refund. When they called to tell us no smoothie, we asked for a refund for that item ($6). They said no. We could have 3 sodas instead (which, btw, if I had ordered them cost $1.79 each so not even a fair substitute). Well, I don't want 3 sodas. I want a refund. Again the response is \"not possible. Call number is on website\". We called the number on the \"contact us\" website and got \"this number is unassigned/unavailable\". SO we searched for the head office and tried to call it. Apparently that was the number for the Avenue Rd location...again no help.  We picked up our order. The staff in the restaurant still refused a refund. They said instead we could choose any item on the menu $6 or less. Again, if we wanted something else, we would have ordered it. The cashier indicated the manager would call us after he returned from a delivery to resolve the situation. He didn't.  The food on top of this was awful. Pad Thai was bland (like ketchup for sauce), coconut lemongrass soup was ok. Very few veggies in it. Mango salad had ripe mangos but dressing was not tangy like it should be.  So for $6, this restaurant had lost a customer for life.   Unless you're looking to be robbed, don't order from Thai one on."}
{"text":"I am just going to give a public service announcement to read other yelp reviews before ordering your food.  I didn't...  now I have ordered and starting to inspect/see things.  Just trust in yelp."}
{"text":"Visited this site 3 times with Groupon.    Site had poor customer service and the food to match.  I will never eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Pad Thai  tastes disgusting. There are much better places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We arrived and  was waiting to be seated and the place was nearly empty, can't say I would go back again as the food was  very bland and the service was really bad. The food taste nothing like Thai food, really oily just nothing good to brag about..."}
{"text":"They charge $2.00 for rice??? This is the only place I've ever been to that serves ONLY curry and does not serve complimentary rice....   Service was slow and unprofessional. She literally brought water that was 1/4, I repeat : one quarter, of the glass full.  Food was mediocre for the prices they charge!   The major turn off was the fact that the place smelled so bad. It smelled like a toilet and they tried to mask the smell with bleach. I don't recommend unless you're in the area and desperately craving thai food. Worst Thai One On I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you're craving some Thai food.  They have lots of options with affordable pricing.   The pad Thai comes with soft noodles, not too spicy, but large chunky chicken.   The vegetable stir fry was our favorite dish!  It's a stir fry of different vegetables, mixed with a delicious coconut sauce and topped with cashews and served with rice. The way they made the sauce and how soft the vegetables were made was absolutely perfect. The sauce was definitely the highlight of the meal, I just mixed the left over with my rice. Will definitely get again!  Service was okay, our waitress was on her first day and kept telling us that over and over (even when we didn't ask). The place itself is in a corner of Scarborough and can barely be seen from the outside. It gives off a very romantic feel.  Lots of variety of options, including a bunch of vege options!"}
{"text":"I had to meet a friend here last night (they chose it) and after reading the reviews on Yelp I was really not looking forward to it.  But, I guess a lot of picky people (aresholes) eat here. This place is perfectly fine for what it is.   If your in the mood for large portions of totally decent Thai food, stop by. It's not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with the bad reviews, but this place really isn't that bad.  It's not 100% authentic thai, but it's not as horrible as a mall food court as somebody mentioned earlier.  I have never entered the actual restaurant but I get delivery from them once in a while.  Their delivery service is reliable and their website to order from is convenient.  I have ordered their pad thai (which is not bland like the new restaurant that just opened on Queen W), spring rolls (actually, these are just ok, I have had better), red curry with mango and beef (yes there are broccoli, but does it really matter?  This is not fine dining) and the spicy eggplant in coconut milk (a little greasy, but tastes pretty good).  They are my go-to place when I forget to pack a lunch/dinner for work.  The portions are HUGE so one order lasts me two meals.  Not fine dining, but definitely A-OK."}
{"text":"Ordered online because they offered a 5% discount.  The site said that food would be here in 45-60 min.  1 hour, 45 min passes.  I call this location and they say that they don't accept online ordering so my order must be with another location and they give me another number.  I end up calling 3 other locations and they say it should be with this Stouffville location, and one says that the Stouffville is closed and I can't order online (WTF?).  I get fed up and want cancel my order.  I'm told to call another number.  I call it and it's a machine and asks me to pick between three options.  All three options result in it hanging up on me.  End result: 2.5+ hours after I ordered, no food, out $44 according to my online statement."}
{"text":"Lemon grass soup is absolutely amazing....the fried rice tastes like nothing else...i am always in conflict between the devils chicken and mango chicken...both taste great....thai one on has quickly grown to a franchise...i have been a regular sincee they  only had 2 locations."}
{"text":"The worker who is usually there at lunch is horrible that I stopped going there for takeout.  I always order over the phone and she will say it will be ready in 10-15 minutes.  I come by 25 min after and guess what? It's not ready.  Actually, there were many cases where no one was at the front desk and was I was stuck waiting there for so long, missing my bus to go back to work.  A few times I saw my food ready to be packed by the chef but the worker is no where to be found.  After a while she finally comes out and packs the rice.  One time my food was ready, but she was taking her sweet time washing glasses at the front...  This restaurant is quite overpriced. Satay on the the Road is a lot better for the price.  I see why they need to use GroupOn to get business."}
{"text":"Best Thai curry I've had! Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious. Highly recommend the Thai Green Curry Shrimp (which I chose because I had two others also recommend it to me). Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The pad thai is generally delicious but man have they upped their prices.  Also pickup discount threshold jumped from $20 to $25.  I can get the same or better thai from elsewhere.  Not sure how often I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that has landed on my banned list, and that's a tough thing to achieve.  The sad part was it really had nothing to do with the food.  Taste wise, the food is okay for a fast food take out joint.  I used to work nearby and had given this place many many chances.  The lunch service is very busy, but their service is just plain horrible.  3 or 4 times it took about 20+ minutes for me to step in and be able to walk out with my take out.  It's just not good enough for \"fast food\".  But what really did them in was that one time my order of Chicken Pad Thai that took 30 minutes (and I was in a rush) got 2 thin slivers of chicken.  I discovered it when I had gotten back to the office.  The next time I went, I told the server about my previous experience and continued to order the Chicken Pad Thai.   It still took a long time and I decided to inspect my meal.  I opened up my box  before I left  to to reveal a whopping 3 slivers of chicken.  I'm not sure about you, but I kinda expect more than 2 grams of protein in whatever dish I generally order.  I'm a man that needs my protein gosh darn it!!  The kicker was when I tried to bring this up to the cashier to show her, she replied with something like \"we're too busy sir, that is what the Pad Thai is like\" (in other words tough luck, your order is like a slot machine, suck it up).    Banned!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't look at reviews before I ordered delivery from here for the first time last night. Am I crazy? Who does that anymore?! I must have been in a hunger trance.  Luckily it was not as terrible quality-wise as the low Yelp score implies - but I understand the \"meh\" rating and find it accurate. I actually thought the food was delicious, but totally overpriced for the underwhelming portions. They also don't win any points by not providing any white rice to go with their entrees. WTF else are you supposed to put curry on?  To further break it down: - Pad Thai ($10-15) was fairly tasty, as fast food Pad Thai generally goes. Overpriced. - Thai Spicy Eggplant ($10) was tasty as hell. I think it was the sauce.  - Pineapple Red Curry Shrimp ($13) was also tasty as hell, but there was barely any shrimp to speak of. Or pineapple, for that matter. So it's pretty much a $13 sauce. - Ginger Tamarind Fish (a ludicrous $18) was not the fillet I anticipated, instead being a small clump of mostly skin and bones. But it was a tasty as hell clump in sauce. Are you sensing a pattern?  In summation: so much sauce, so little rice (none). Food is really good, but it's a worthy option only if you have 1) some sort of significant discount and 2) rice."}
{"text":"went to the queen st location with a an online deal.   I ordered shrimp and the shrimp were not deveined. I was too disgusted to eat it. gross!!"}
{"text":"This was a cute little spot off Whites Rd and 401 in Durham. The service was great and the place had a casual atmosphere.  I got the Red Curry Shrimp. Great presentation and it was delicious! A good number of actual shrimp. I'm saying that because I usually get just a couple when I order any shrimp curry at a Thai spot. The only con? The menu had 2 chillies next to this menu item. I asked for it to be spicer (3 chilly level) and they did NOT deliver on that. Didn't feel like the chilly level was exceedingly spicy at all - more like a one chilly level. Regardless, tasty, well priced and a great experience.   Also, a co-worker asked them to make accommodations for her meal. The waitress went to the back and asked and they happily made those accommodations."}
{"text":"Ordered a pad thai. They gave me noodles in ketchup. I want my money back.  I don't feel like there's much more to say but Yelp wants a longer review before I can post and I feel like it's my responsibility to warn the masses."}
{"text":"Good take out place for Thai, customer service isn't great but the food is what's most important  Pad Thai is delicious. Along with stir fried glass noodles, fried rice, eggplant coconut curry, and the red curry. Has not disappointed this far. And have been coming here since I can remember. Recommend forsure. But like I said, not a great place to dine in in my opinion"}
{"text":"Dine-in experience:  Pros:  -Delicious food -huge portions -good prices  Cons:  -service is slow -we usually don't get checked up on after getting our food so we have to kinda just stare until they notice we're waiting so we can get our bill.  But I still love the food and the portions so I'll still be coming back"}
{"text":"The vegetable samosas, holy crap, the vegetable samosas...   My boyfriend and I stopped in for a quick late night \"snack\" while heading back to our Airbnb around the corner, and I was completely awestruck by the vegetable samosas. We had to go back the next night and order double, each, because they were sooooo good. I also ordered the Curry Pad Thai and it was also delicious. The young man at the counter was also super nice and really patient with us not being able to agree on what to get initially.   If we return to Toronto, I'll be back here for more!"}
{"text":"Massive portions and free delivery! I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai which was good and relatively cheap for the amount of food you get. The food came quickly and service was great!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone hates these guys? Ordered from justeat.ca tonight. We were impressed, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The daughter and I love the Pad Thai.  I enjoy the beef while my daughter loves the veggie (no egg) Pad Thai.  We share a mango salad and as we get ours to go we get two free spring rolls.    The portions are very fair and the leftovers are great when re-heated.  If you decide to go fir pick up on a Friday between 4:00 pm and 7:00 pm.  You may want to order ahead.  The wait can be upwards of 25-30 mins with back orders."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Thai food in Stouffville, I would recommend this restaurant.  The owner is very friendly, the food is good.  Watch out for the daily specials.  The favorites in my house are the Thai One On fried rice, which is the special on Mondays.  We also like the Curry Pad Thai, and the green curry chicken."}
{"text":"I really like Thai food. I eat is much as I possibly can. So, when I was getting my hair cut at my barber who is adjacent to this restaurant I couldn't help but make a mental note to come by and check out this establishment. It is located in a strip mall in Scarborough, Ontario. Yea, that's right, I ate in a strip mall in Scarborough, aren't I brave? The location is most surrounded by a what appears to be a blue collar South Asian Population. In terms of affluence, it is pretty standard fair for Scarborough. Though, judging by the condos I can see slightly off in the distance, and the plans to build a Subway line out to Scarborough town center by possible future mayor Rob Ford, the beginnings of Gentrification are indeed reaching even Scarborough of all places. However, I digress.  The service for this restaurant is fairly good Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a server who sat us at a table. The decoration was pretty interesting, they had high backed benches which gave the feeling that I was sitting at a booth. Personally, I very much prefer the feeling of sitting at a booth while eating over eating at a table. While eating at a table, I always feel exposed, and like I can't really have a conversation. So I definitely give major points for the setup of the restaurant. The decorations were modern, with accents which were appropriate to the type of food that is being served.  While there I ordered three dishes. Thai Spring rolls, Lemngrass soup (which they said was like Tom Yum Soup) and Vegetarian Pad Thai.  Spring Rolls - The spring rolls were good. I like the way that they slice the spring rolls in half and serve it with a sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts. It doesn't really add anything to the dish, however, it gives the impression that they care enough about the meal to try to plate it nicely for you. The spring rolls themselves were good. They did not taste too spicy, or too bland, they went well with th sauce, and were very nice on the palate.  Lemon Grass Soup - This soup was good. For the way that they made it, it was fairly decent. Personally, if I were them I would have preferred just a little bit more citrus in the soup, with a little bit of cilantro in it to give it a little extra zip. The spring rolls came with a garnish of cilantro with a shredded and put into the soup and used the lime from my water, and it really tasted kind of awesome. I felt kind of awkward making the suggestion to them however, so I didn't.   Veg Pad Thai - Ok, this was the low part of the experience. First of all, they didn't ask how hot I wanted it. I have mentioned this before, but this is always a bad sign when they don't give you an option in terms of how spicy you want your pad thai.  Also, the Pad Thai definitely tasted of ketchup. There had a lot of vegetables in it, and the ketchup wasn't too obnoxious, however, I definitely tasted it pretty obviously. Usually places use ketchup instead  of tamarind to either keep the cost down, or if they don't really know how to make pad thai. I'm not really sure what the case was here. But, I hate it when my pad thai tastes of ketchup. Then again, this is Scarborough, so I am not really sure how authentic I should be expecting the Pad Thai to be. Keeping that in mind, I will temper my expectations. They made a good faith effort to make a good dish, it was otherwise cooked very well, they had lots of vegetables, and peanut, and lemon slices.   All in all, it was a very good eating experience, the prices were very reasonable and the people there were very pleasant. If I was in the area and wanted thai I would definitely consider stopping in and getting some."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, Customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had food delivered to my house. It was quick and the food was brilliant! I have been craving for thai food for awhile and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Are you fucking kidding me?  I made the mistake of walking in here spontaneously with a visiting friend. Service was disorganized, indifferent and at some point a waitress actually gestured for me to come up to the front desk in order to speak to her because she was engrossed in a conversation with the other wait staff. This was the tip of the iceberg.   The chicken I was received in my curry appeared to be precooked and a strange spongey textured but pink/gray appearance. Upon showing it to the waitress, she apologized and also remarked that all of their meat looks like that. Please take my word for this: I eat some grimy, awesomely cheap food and absolutely love it. Meat quality is not a sticking point for me. I don't even need to know what it used to be in its past life, but it has to at least look and taste like meat.  The beef I was given was similar in texture but passable. The service was, again, slow and unprofessional but maybe they're working out the kinks. Most importantly, of the 3 dishes we ordered, and the original replaced curry, none would have been particularly satisfactory for a home cook working off some FoodNetwork.ca recipe of the week, much less a restaurant in such a prime location. They seem to have put more effort into the decor than the food, as the Thai cuisine seems almost an afterthought.   Pre-cooked, texturally unappealing ...meat?... inconsistent vegetable prep, mediocre spicing, and poor service."}
{"text":"I too neglected to yelp this restaurant before ordering delivery, never again  When the best thing you got was spring rolls you know there is an issue  My order was small. shrimp phad thai, beef devil and beef with glass noodles  The shrimp phad thai was tasty but looked and tasted like imitation phad thai equipped with phad thai sauce, stay away  The beef devil was billed as spicy but was sweet and was generally a regrettable menu choice  The beef with glass noodles was also billed as spicy but sadly disappointed, lets just say yelp will accompany all of my future orders, anywhere"}
{"text":"WORST THAI MEAL IN TORONTO. You call this food? We ordered thru justeat.ca because they had a lot of positive reviews, and ordered the Aromatic Seafood Combination for $18.99, and the Thai Basil Beef for $12.99, for an order total of $36.14.  They delivered exactly on time as per just eat email (~1hr), and included an order of white rice.  When ordering, the seafood description said it was ideal for sharing, and we thought that meant the portion was larger, however it was the same portion as the basil beef.  Never mind that.  Both the seafood and beef were drenched in thick oil that was much more on the throw-up side than the greasy side of all the Chinese/Thai food we ever had.  This was gross.  We opened the white rice only to smell a dirty laundry smell in the rice.  After draining both seafood and beef to start eating, we found them both to be very spicy even though we avoided the chicken basil because they had the chili sign beside it.  The vegetables (mainly onions, peppers & 1 broccoli) in the food were overcooked almost to the point of being buttery, and the shrimp was very grainy as if it had been cooked to death.  We honestly believe that they had this stuff on a warmer for 3 days and were just happy to get rid of this stuff.  Had we been in the restaurant, we would have definitely returned everything back.  Now, it's making its way through our drains... we couldn't even throw the food in the garbage with all this grease.  We will definitely avoid this place until eternity."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  Ordered from here on a Sunday at 11:45 AM using the online ordering system. They say the order will arrive between 45-60 min. It was 1:15 already and we had heard nothing.   I called he restaurant and the person on the phone accused me of lying saying that the order was not placed at 11:45. I told him I had an email indicating the time.   He told me the driver had just left 5 minutes ago and repeated multiple times that the order was delayed because they are busy.   When the driver showed up she did not come to our door, rather asked us to come down to the lobby. She informed me that she did not have the drinks that we ordered. I asked if she could at minimum refund the money I paid for the drinks but she appeared frazzled. She asked me to give her change for a $50 which I did not have. She then went with me to a convenience store around the corner to get change for her $50.   I don't understand why a driver would not carry change. What if a customer was paying by cash?   The whole experience was ridiculous and frustrating. I would have appreciated a phone call at minimum from the restaurant saying that they were delayed. Instead i was accused of lying about when I placed my order and an incompetent driver.  They offered a free pad Thai on the next order but hell if I ever order from this chain again."}
{"text":"meh. ordered delivery pad thai and spring rolls, nothing impressed. Pad thai was a large amount in the container, but mediocre flavour and little ingredients, just a lot of noodles."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai chicken. Nothing special. Green onions & peanuts were on the side with a slice of orange & lemon. Not bad."}
{"text":"Really a 2.5 star review.   This is my first time trying this place and I ordered it through a 40% off tasteaway promo code.  Estimate delivery time was a conservative 90 minutes and I got the food in about 70 minutes. They are on Avenue south of Wilson and I am at Yonge and Sheppard.  When I received the order, everything was provided: chopsticks, forks, sauces, napkins, crushed peanuts, and takeout menu with promo codes.  Without ever having been in one of their locations, I wasn't totally sure what to expect but hopefully it would be decent Thai food.  The salad roll I ordered was the worst I ever had. The ingredients inside the roll were fresh and had a decent presentation within the delivery box with a slice of orange and some slices of fresh mango. The rolls were sliced into 6 pieces and presented like sushi.  I'm glad they did this because the rice wrap was hard like plastic.  I ate a couple of pieces with the wrap and then gave up.  I emptied out the contents and threw out the \"plastic rings\". I was basically left with a mango salad which is what I should have ordered in the first place.  The pad thai with chicken and shrimp was average but still hot in temperature. I really had no issues with it and there was a decent amount of chicken, tofu and shrimp.  The chicken devil was also still hot in temperature but again, just average. It is quite spicy but nothing too hot.  There are chili peppers mixed within so if you choose to eat them, it would make the chicken spicier. I also made my own rice at home to eat with this.  Despite this review, there's certainly a chance I may try this place again... especially if tasteaway has another 40% off promo code.  I just won't order the salad roll. I probably wouldn't bother to dine-in either.  Delivery suits me just fine."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the food I order from here. Their coconut milk soup is wonderful and so are their spicy noodles (hint: you can get it with less spice and it is also just as good). Very convenient and tasty"}
{"text":"Thai One On : Most Disappointing !  One of the worst place I've been too in terms of food and service ... All the food we ordered was Way too Sweet and Overpowering with Sauce ... Most disappointing was that we got all our main dishes served at different times rather than together.  We didnt get our last dish served until 15 min into our dinner  and they even forgot a Dish we ordered !  Upside: Decor is nice and presentation of food appetizing ( Just wish I could eat it ... LOL ). All in All : Wont go back ... ever !"}
{"text":"An interesting Thai restaurant located on King Street West. I used the Ritual app to order my food here. I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken with a side of brown rice. It was near closing time so the restaurant was pretty empty and I had the last order of the night. It's more of a quick to eat establishment but gives the option of the patrons to dine-in. For takeout Pad Thai, it was surprisingly very good. Very nice flavours and nicely seasoned. I really enjoyed my dinner that night because I was actually stuffed from all that pad thai and was surprised they gave so much. I was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to eat the side of brown rice that I ordered. Overall, I was impressed with this Thai restaurant and would be happy to come here to try some of there only menu items. Definitely recommend trying this place out if you are looking for good thai food!"}
{"text":"LMFAO THIS PLACE IS A JOKE! So, I first tried this place a few years ago. I fell in love with their curry chicken pad thai, I still love it. However, let me tell you about my recent experience at Thai One On.    THEY ARE SCAMMERS.  Me and my boyfriend ordered online, paid and all. They call us about 10 minutes after we put in the order to say he lives too far and they're not going to deliver it and to call a number to get a refund. I call that number, they send me to another number. I called the second number, they gave me another number. I called that number and finally got a response, the person told me I should see a refund on my statement in 72 hours. I waited a week and NOTHING. I called the same person number again - 4163151164. He states he will call me back in 30 minutes. Never did. Called all afternoon and HE REJECTED MY CALL. I left messages, nothing. I decided to call from my work (which calls as unknown). He picks up, and I told him who I am, and HE HANGS UP.   So I've still have NOT received my refund. THE ONLINE TECHNICAL SUPPORT ARE SCAMMERS. THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOU, DO NOT BUY FROM THAI ONE ON. THEY HAVE ALSO FAILED MANY HEALTH INSPECTIONS. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"This location used to be good 3 or 4 years ago. But it has gone down hill since then, I am not sure if it is under new ownership or new chefs but the food has not been good.  Recently I gave this location another try and ordered take out. The calamari had an off smell, it's seafood I know but this was different, took two bites and to tasted like it was fried in old oil. The second thing ordered was the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai, again a disappointing the noodles were mashed and over cooked, too much tamarind made it sour and I literally counted 3 shrimp and no real peices of chicken it was more like left over chicken shavings. Its a shame, I will have to find another Thai Food restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried two different dishes. Devil Chicken and pad thai. We also had samosas.   The vegetable samosas were really good, no complaints.   The Devil Chicken was amazing. Not sure what the sauce was but found this dish better than the average pad thai in Toronto. Was also filling.  As for the pad thai I was disappointed. It was one of the worst I've had. I usually find pad thai pretty good and most places seem to know how to make it but I wouldn't recommend going to Thai One On for this dish.  The price was decent and worth it. Also friendly staff."}
{"text":"Egg fried rice , beef devil , basil beef ,  very tasty.   Service is ok , you can also take out and order delivery.  If you like thai food, you can try it."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for tonight. Got the Thai spring roles, the green mango salad, and sticky coconut rice. All dishes were perfect! We loved them! Speedy delivery too."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food, and friendly service.  Great for dine in or take out.     My favourite is the green curry chicken and the lemon grass soup."}
{"text":"Good place for food but bloody rude staff. Really annoying. I went with a friend and my friend was asking details about kinds of food. The reply from the girl( Chinese-Not the skinny girl), The girl with a cap on was very rude she said comes with rice or noodles how many times should i tell you. And when my friend asked about another dish, she used very foul language in Chinese, little did she know that my south asian friend can understand her language. Ridiculous service i have ever seen in Canada. For this reason, i would not recommend visiting this place"}
{"text":"These guys have a good home delivery service. I have been ordering thai from these guys for very long time now. But they do offer 10% off on pick up."}
{"text":"Just stop for a quick lunch for the first time in this place and I got the golden chicken curry that is one of the best I ever had, didn't expect that quality dish on a fast food restaurant. They were very fast and the prices is friendly.i will definitely will comeback here when I'm in the area.(spicy dish)"}
{"text":"Review on Take-out:  I've never frequented any of the other locations, so this was my first experience with them. Calling in was pretty painless and smooth; they got my order, Green Mango Salad and Basil Tofu and confirmed my name and gave me the time of pick up.   The basil tofu was still tender, but I think the sauce was oversalted. The Green Mango Salad was more regular, ripe mango than green mango but it was still juicy and freshly chopped. Rice is not included with the mains in the dinner menu and one of my pet peeves is not getting rice included with mains, but I digress.   Thai one on is worth a try."}
{"text":"Everything in this restaurant is average and below. Expect minnmum meat item in your soup and rice. I orderd tom yum soup which they call it lemontile or something similar.  I got only to small pieces of chicken in the soup. The same for chicken fried rice some only few slices of chicken and aal this for extremely high prices"}
{"text":"Terrible pad Thai. Like laughably bad.   Ordered spring rolls, chicken pad, and the fried rice. The spring rolls were actually not too bad and the rice was passable but there's just no excuse for bad pad Thai at a Thai place.   Do yourself a favour and don't eat here."}
{"text":"In my starving state and driving past this place I swung in to get some take out.  Big big mistake.  We placed our order and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  It was THAT busy...a few people came in after us to place our order and it seemed a few people called in for delivery.  There must have been at least 4 people working here with one person dedicated to delivery.  So not sure what took so long to get the order done.  We only ordered 3 dishes, with one being a spicy beef salad.  Well after about 20 min we got our order, got into the car and went home.  My mouth is salivating by this time, so anxious to tear into by spicy beef salad...and then we open the bag and start puling out the dishes.  No salad.  In fact the entire order is WRONG!  Not one thing we ordered is in the bag.  WTF?  Too busy chatting away for the staff to do any quality control and make sure what we order is what we get. So that means someone else got the wrong order as well.    Never will I go back.  I can certainly see why others have complained about poor customer service.  I ended up just making something from home because I was so turned off by the whole experience. Their staff obviously is more interested in themselves than anything else.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Excelent flavours to their food.  My favourite cashew chicken.  Great pad Thai.  Never really had a bad meal here.  This is a takeout only place.  Only a few tables that seat 1-2. Nice owners.  The place is dirty which is a big turn off.  Floors always filthy.  Don't know how this got a pass for health standards.  Did they send a blind inspector?"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with dine in or take out from here.  The portion sizes are quite generous for the price paid, although the lack of complimentary rice is a nuisance for someone like myself who gravitates towards the Thai curries. I've yet to try anything I haven't enjoyed.  Service when dining in can occasionally be slow."}
{"text":"A regular at this place. Usually order the Chicken Pad Thai (noodles, tofu, chicken, a sprinkling of green onions and a pack of ground peanuts on the side), Spring Rolls (2, with sauce) and/or the Ginger Chicken (stuffed with chicken and different mushrooms, a few red peppers and a flavorful sauce).  Note that each of these will feed 2 or can be used as leftovers (unless you're really hungry).    It's a great place for takeout or delivery.  It's not really a good place to eat in, since the tables are minuscule and if a crowd comes in to order, you're stuck with their hip in your face as they line up - or you're next to where the girls pack up the orders or by the bathroom.  They have a few barstools in front which are good if you can get them.  Tips: the menu has freebies when you order a certain amount, but it's only applicable if you're not buying a discounted item in your total.  Also, there's a lunch menu which includes rice with things like the Ginger Chicken, or discounted items, but you have to pick them up. No delivery for Lunch Specials.  Once you're acquainted with how they do this, it's usually no issue."}
{"text":"Lovely interior.  Intimate restaurant and good service.    Usually order the Chicken Pad Thai (noodles, tofu, chicken, a sprinkling of green onions and a pack of ground peanuts on the side), Spring Rolls (2, with sauce) and/or the Ginger Chicken (stuffed with chicken and different mushrooms, a few red peppers and a flavorful sauce).  We also order the dinner for two which has a green mango salad, spring rolls, chicken pad thai and sweet sticky rice with mango.  Note that each of these will feed 2 or can be used as leftovers (unless you're really hungry).    Tips: the menu has freebies when you order a certain amount, but it's only applicable if you're not buying a discounted item in your total.

{"text":"Was disappointed with my fist order at this place (mango tofu). Tried it again twice more including the pad Thai. Even for late night munchies the food just doesn't taste food, the pad Thai is made with ketchup, I'll never go here again."}
{"text":"I have a really tricky relationship with this place. When its good, i absolutely love it and can eat it all day everyday.  But unfortunately it's not consistent. The girls that work there and take orders are pretty clueless. Don't know their own menu, argue with customers on the phone, over charge, and punch in the wrong dishes.   They always have trouble with the order. and its pretty simple. They often punch in the wrong dish or don't apply the discount when i let them know after realizing they usually tell me there is nothing they can do even though i am a pretty loyal customer.  I think for me i still go since the food is good when its actually made fresh and its the right order but it is more likely because it is so close by to me.   I really wish they could step up their management, since this place has got some great potential."}
{"text":"So placed an order around noon on orderit for food to be delivered at 6:30. Delivery guy called me at 1 trying to deliver and had to call the restaurant to say the order was clearly placed for 6:30. Around 6:45 and no delivery yet I called the restaurant. The guy clearly know what the order was as he remembered my apartment and I didn't need to specify it. He assured me it was on it's way. I called again at 7:30 wondering what was going on as still no deliver and it was now an hour late, again the guy said it was on its way and just really bad traffic and they only had 1 delivery guy. I called again at 8 and demanded to speak to the manager who claimed I never placed an order with them despite having the email confirmation and seeing the pending transaction already charged to my credit card. Ended up calling orderit to cancel my order as these guys clearly have no idea wth they are doing."}
{"text":"I took my son here for lunch today, to celebrate his 15th birthday. I am now wishing I had a time machine and could go back in time, and take him somewhere else.   To begin with, the service was horrible. It took a waitress 10-15 minutes to come and take our order. We both ordered a soft drink and my son had the Marinated Grilled Chicken ($11.99) and I had the Spicy Stir-fried Crab ($14.99). We also ordered the Crispy Tofu as an appetizer.  After about a 10 minute wait they brought the appetizer and our drinks. It was as advertized, Crispy Tofu and it was decent. A few minutes later they brought my son's grilled chicken.  It was served luke warm and was almost flavorless. My Crab dish came 10 minutes later. $14.99 for a crab dish made of imitation crab meat. You've got to be kidding me! It was terrible and I could barely eat it, in fact I barely ate any of it.  This is a restaurant to be avoided at all costs. In an area crawling with great places to eat, Thai One On, is not one of them. I gave it a single star review because I could not rate it in the negatives. Consider my true rating a -5 stars."}
{"text":"Simply put, it's not very good. The Pad Thai tamarind was mostly ketchup, and is way too sweet regardless of what it's made of. The rolls were okay but too greasy, however I'll give a pass on that as complaining about deep fried food being greasy is like going to a BMW dealership and complaining that the cars are too European. They are what they are.  Not worth the trip, go to Thai Express instead."}
{"text":"Two big issues:  1) the delivery/ takeout menu says the curry includes rice, in fact it does not, and when you point this out to the restaurant they say rice is extra and the menu is wrong!  how is that okay? 2) the vegetables in my curry tasted stale. How does that happen? I had to throw out my $15 curry-without-rice included dish.  Worst. Experience. Ever."}
{"text":"This place has been closed down and is now rebranded Stouffville Thai.   It's run by I think the restaurant next door which is an Indian restaurant. It's a nice setting I think in a bad location. The place itself isn't actually run by Thai people, at least on the surface. They may have spent some time in Thailand or learned from Thai cooking masters, but they, just like the Indian place next door are Sri Lankan operated. That's okay and that doesn't factor in at all, just thought it should be included for transparency.   The food is fine. It's not fine dining, but it's not a cheap, cheap Chinese take out place. Everything is prepared to order, it's just it's not the most authentic tasting or looking. That's fitting of a place with a 3.0/5.0 rating.   The one annoying thing, and this is the most annoying part is that they've rebranded about a year ago, but had only recently sent out new take out menus which appear to have caused an uptick in orders and business. The take out menus advertise a ton of specials, including daily specials, as well as discounts available for pick-up etc. That's not the annoying part, the annoying part is that they only offer any of those discounts and daily special pricing to GIFT CARD HOLDERS.   I thought fine, sure I'll put the money on a gift card and pay with a gift card, that's not a problem. I'll put like $30 on there, pay $20 for my meal and come back another time to take full advantage. The Gift Card costs $100 and they try every time to sell it you. That is a little underhanded. Especially when the take out menu has all of the deals and specials on it. Buying a $100 gift card when the average item costs around $8 is a little disingenuous of them and was a little bit of a turn off.  Having said that, the food is okay and fills you up so if you really want something it's not a bad alternative given the other Thai place in town, Thai Villa, had raised their prices on nearly everything on the menu and cut their portion sizes. Which is unfortunate.   Solid 3.0/5/0."}
{"text":"Ok, I glanced at the Yelp reviews just after sitting down and was alarmed to see the 1 1/2 star average...this place is firmly in the two to 2.5 star territory, so dont' be too alarmed.  First of all, the interior is badly dated.  The benches are all ripped up, my menu was stuck together, and the trip to the washroom is disgusting (see my photo of the tank of \"mystery\" fluid in the basement).  I have to give conditions here a 1-star rating.  The food was pretty typical, about 2.5 stars.  We ordered a fried spicy noodle dish which was something like pad si ew.  It was quite strange, the menu didn't list the Thai names for most dishes, so I was kind of guessing as to what they were.  In fact, I'm not sure that either the Russian waiter or Chinese cook knew anything about Thai food.  The noodles were spicy, which was nice, and super greasy, which was not.   We also got a red curry, which was a bit on the bland side.  They were kind of lazy chopping up the vegetables, so all the veggies were over-sized.    Overall, the food was not nearly as bad as I might have feared, and the service was actually respectable.  Our Russian waitress checked on us and refilled our waterglasses often.  The prices were way too high for the value of food delivered though.  This is similar to fast food quality.  I do worry about cleanliness issues, however, as the dining room, menu, washrooms, and basement were all quite worrying.  I'm sure there's better Thai somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery,  received an email confirmation for my order,  2 hours later I am still waiting. Very bad first impression.  Will never try again."}
{"text":"I've been here before once - with subpar service.  This time, it was horrific.  Okay - first, we had reservations at 12:00 PM under my old coworker's name.  We get to the place, turns out they gave our seats to these other people that were there (they were obviously not part of our group).  Took them about 10-15 minutes to come up to us to get our orders and our food.  Orders were continuously wrong, and one of my coworkers didn't get his food until an hour later.  Why the heck would you only have TWO people working the tables during lunch hours!?  HORRIBLE SERVICE.  I would give these no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Food was rather good but service was almost non-existent. Lots of attention paid to diners in groups, especially businessmen. Don't recommend going in as a solo diner, as I did, staff treated me as if I was waiting for a take-out order. Won't go back even though I did have the courtesy to leave 20% tip."}
{"text":"Not welcoming at all. The servers didn't wanna assist and was moody.  I mean, cmon if you are in the service industry at least greet customers with a smile... .    We enjoyed their take out a few weeks ago, and wanted to dine in today, but ended up walking out of the restaurant.  Wow..."}
{"text":"I order delivery from this place often. They always have a 20%-25% off coupon from either their own site or one of those sites like justeat.ca or tasteaway. I like their golden curries and Malaysian curries, but their Pad Thais tastes way too sweet and feels like fried ketchup (with the exception of the curry pad thai, which I really like). Their coconut sticky rice dessert is also very delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp pad Thai for $13.99 Got it to go and it was ready in 20 minutes just like they said. The portions are really large and there was alot of fresh shrimps.  I found that there was too much sauce and it tasted like there was a lot of ketchup added. I usually finish my meals but I found that I was forcing myself to finish it. Overall an okay meal but there are many other Thai restaurants around which are much better at the same price."}
{"text":"We go to Thai one on frequently, we love to order the curried eggplant and green mango salad. Thank you for many great dinners."}
{"text":"Food is good. I love the cashew nut chicken. Eating area is no frills. Probably one of the better Thai places in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some quick take-out as I just got in to the city.  Prices looked reasonable and I ordered a Seafood Pad Thai.  With tax it was just under $15.  The girl at the counter mentioned it would be 10 min and my food was good to the timing!   It had excellent flavour with lots of Seafood but little on the veg side.  A few people were eating by the window when I arrived.  I peered to see what they were eating.  Looked good with generous portions.  Definitely a fast food asian takeout place but I'd return to try something else!"}
{"text":"Well, we ordered for delivery and the food was 2 hours late. Apparently it was sitting in a car for 45 minutes. it was overheated and kind of mushy.  Overall, the food was quite bad. We wanted some veggies with the meat dishes but the spinach was obviously frozen bits of spinach literally floating above a mucus looking bed of sauce. the pad thai was standard tasting and overcooked. the other dishes were edible but nothing special.  The price wasn't cheap. the food was. Toronto has great Thai food. Go find it elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a fast food Thai place with seating. I had the glass noodles and the calamari and they were both good but nothing special. The place is clean and the staff is friendly but the food took a little longer than I expected. Their pricing is reasonable for what you are getting and the portions were large enough that the you will be full afterwards.   I would check this place again if I am in the area and looking for some Thai food."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Monday night and used a coupon I purchased online. There was only one person serving two other occupied tables. She was friendly, however she disappeared quite often when we were ready to order or wanted more water.   Ordered two tomyum soups (one with chicken), one vegetarian pad thai, and one spicy thai beef rice noodles. Tomyum soup was a bit off the flavour im used to, it was more sweet then spicy... the chicken one had a generous amount of meat in it. Vegeterian pad thai was pretty standard. The best thing was definitely the thay spicy noodles, very tasty and a good amount of spice.  They do not serve alcohol and washrooms are located downstairs."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I came here for lunch on a Friday.  That \"be back in 15\" became 45.  One order of Chicken Pad Thai took almost an hour to make when the place is clearly meant to be a grab and go place.. it was also strange because out of everyone I went with, we all got our orders at different times when we originally placed the orders one after the other.  I got mine after customers which ordered after me .. like, what?  You're excused, Thai One On.  (..don't understand the name either.  halfassed attempt at alliteration?)   The service was just way down there.  The food itself had really big portions, but the pad thai was horrendously sour.  I ate barely half of what they gave me and threw out the rest.  My coworker who ordered the Spicy Cashew Chicken really enjoyed his dish, though.  But I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone not  looking to get fired for an afternoon-long lunch break.  Maybe the chef went for a smoke break in between the orders.. the restaurant is near to a tobacco company after all"}
{"text":"Really impressed not only with the quality of food but large quantities too. That's a rare double win for a glutton like myself."}
{"text":"I went here, and ordered here and thought to myself, it can't be that bad.  All these 1 star reviews?  They must be crazy.  I don't normally eat in this part of the city, but the Ritual App offered me free food, and I enjoy Thai food, so I thought that those two things could work together.  I got a free pad thai, and it was plentiful and filling... in the way eating a loaf of bread would be plentiful and filling.  Not one of those good Olive loaves, or that Avocado toast that I keep hearing about.  Not even Wonderbread.  It would be like eating a loaf of \"Great Value bread\" with nothing on it.    The Pad Thai was flavourless, and while there was meat in it, there was so little that I could hardly see it at first - and that was ordering an extra helping of it.  So there it was - the meal was free, and I still can't give it higher than one star.  I want to make sure other people know what they're getting into.  Remember though - it was filling.  That was not the issue.  It just wasn't... good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3-4 times. The food is good but not outstanding. The portion sizes are good as well, but here's the problem...staff is unfriendly. They almost make you feel like you're a hindrance in some ways. No smiling, no interaction (beyond the order/food passing). That's not a restaurant that works for me. Not going to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered from just eat, costed me about 40$ for two containers of curry, and no rice. There wasn't even anywhere on the menu to order steamed rice. So I made some at home, and tried out the food. Honestly, it's just not good, texture was all slimy and made me gag a bit, there was always a bit of a weird bitter taste in my food.   It was a waste of money, I'd rather go back to the restaurant that accidentally served me a staple in my curry than come here, at least the food there is edible."}
{"text":"This restaurant lost a $20 for 10 cents! No thank you Thai One On. I'll take my business where it is appreciated. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Went there with coworkers for lunch.  They had  special for lunch, 8$.    Locale: I must have walked by this place 100 times, never though of actually going in.  The place is out dated but seemed cleaned.   Food: I ordered mango chicken, they had 4 very large pieces of mango, almost like they did not care to cut it into smaller pieces.    Service: we were the only ones there, and the waiter did not come to refill the water or anything like that.  When we were done, we had to call the waiter over to charge us.    I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap sit down lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's up with the poor reviews for this place. The food and service were excellent. I had the Curry on Rice, and it hit the spot. The waitress was very attentive, and pleasant. The price was reasonable. The portions were huge. I really enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"I work at the rogers, the next building over. I eat here when I'm ill and I want to reward myself for coming in to work sick.   I always order the mango chicken with steamed rice. it's a bit pricy but it's delicious and it's enough to keep me eating all the way through a five or seven hour shift."}
{"text":"This branch is my favorite delivery restaurants when I'm too lazy to cook or go out.  I always order their Green mango salad & Chicken pad thai for delivery and I love them both. I occasionally tried couple other things but they all were very good.  However, I would only order from them when I am willing to wait for about 1hour. They do call you to confirm the delivery time but always expect to wait because they will always take their time.  Also they don't have very good customer service. I never ate in the restaurant but I do go there to pick up my order sometimes. It's not that they are mean, but they don't smile or try to help you."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, and the food is very overpriced. The food was slimy and tasted terrible. Never coming back and ruined my opinion on thai food."}
{"text":"I mean, this place is what it is - a fast-food Thai place. What I do find is that I like their food better than Springrolls, for example. Their portions are very large, so one meal will last for two easily.  Usually we just order delivery and they are quite fast and polite. I have tried several things from the menu and quite liked them all, although i would avoid anything with bamboo shoots in it. They are tough and sharp!  Nothing is particularly special though, so this place doesn't make it to the four or five star mark. It's just there, in case you want some half-decent Thai food."}
{"text":"We ordered on just eat. The food got delivered 1 hour and 40 mins LATER!!! when I called the restaurant the attendant told me the driver went out 40 mins ago.. when the food got here it was barely warm overly saucey and they literally put two think sliced sad pieces of meat in the \"beef\" soup and I can absolutely assure you there was NOT OODLES OF NOODLES!   I had been looking forward to this all week and this sad excuse for food ruined my entire day, well whatever was left of it. The restaurant also doesn't give any concerns about how upset you are so save yourself the disappointment and do not order from here!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on the weekend.  Order three dishes including basil beef, green curry chicken and a tofu and pepper dish.  The green curry chicken is the only reason I gave stars.  It was great but the basil beef had no kick to it and the tofu dish was all tofu and no peppers.  A fast food Thai restaurant would a preferred location."}
{"text":"I ordered food online this week from Thai One On for me and my teenaged kids. I paid approximately $75.00 on VISA and the food never arrived! We waited for two hours for the food before giving up and ordering from another place. In those two hours our calls were ignored (the line just rang continuously till the line disconnected), and our emails to Customer Support were never answered (they sent me a standard response saying that someone would contact me soon but, other than that, I got no response). It's now been almost two days since I ordered and paid. I sent them a follow-up email yesterday but I'm still waiting for a response from Customer Support. I told them that, at the very least, I want my money back. No response.   I've been ordering food online for years and this ranks as the worst experience I've ever had, by far. Who keeps hungry people waiting for food that never arrives? Who treats their customers like crap by ignoring  phone calls and not answering emails sent to customer support? Who takes your money and then disappears without giving you what you paid for? The answer, of course, is people who don't care and who don't know how to run a business. My advice would be to save yourself a big headache and take your business someplace else!"}
{"text":"Dammit if only Khao San Road was just a bit closer.  You know the feeling...you get that hankering for Thai food...but you feel lazy so you go to the nearest place...and that's when the disappointment begins.  I will say that the Pad Thai is passable but every other dish I've tried has been pretty disgusting...I don't event know why I bother trying some unknown dish.  Thai One On - please change your cooks.  There is a serious deficiency back there.  Malay Curry Beef is so thick it's like eating molasses.  Oodles of Noodles sound like Salad King's Thai Islamic Noodles but it's spaghetti in corn oil soup - seriously, there's like a handful of noodles and the oil is filled to the top.   Red Curry or Green Curry - you're better of going across the street to Loblaws and picking up a PC Thai Frozen Dinner.   If you like Spring Rolls, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I've been ordering online from them for the last month (at least 5 times) and their food hits the spot. I have yet to be disappointed by their Pad Thai and rice dishes. Haven't been to the restaurant but I can only imagine that it would taste even better fresh at the table!  The only con is that delivery takes a bit long (usually about an hour to an hour-and-a-half wait) but once the food is in my belly, all is forgiven. Will be ordering from them a lot more in future!"}
{"text":"This place is sub-par, but my bf swears by their chicken devil so that's got to count for something. I usually get the beef pad thai and it is addictively tasty, but the beef is sometimes stringy and tough. I might try the chicken next time.  One time I ordered a 'lunch' version of the pad thai which was cheaper but any time I've gone back since that time, it's never been offered nor have I seen it advertised. I also saw that if your order is over $20, they give you 10% off...well this only happens sometimes as well..I guess it depends on the mood of the cashier? lol... Kind of strange.  I'm also curious about their posted business hours. It says they open at 4pm on weekends, but I was there at 4:45 and there was no one inside, no lights on...I waited around for a bit but then ultimately had to get something else. I called in an order one time on the weekend (after 4pm as well) and the phone just rang and rang.   Prices are a little high for what you get but it's not the worst stuff out there."}
{"text":"I was really annoyed ordering from this location I OFTEN  get take out from York mills . I wrote huge paragraph about my allergy and requested food with no ONION. Also wrote in big huge letters do not ring my DOORBELL just call . When delivery came an hour later clueless lady started ringing down my DOORBELL it turned out she didn't even speak English and was lazy to make a call .  Food turned out to be loaded with onions I called their line some really rude man answered and I was told that he didn't see my comment/huge note thru the website ( SMH THEY PRINTED MY NOTE ALONG WITH THE RECIEPT AND GAVE IT TO ME ) and I SHOULD BE VERY LUCKY BECAUSE THEY DONT DO DELIVERY IF ITS LESS THAN $40.I made my order thru their web site that's y they delivered it is just ridiculous. Never again . Terrible service . Terrible disrespectful and unprofessional stuff . BTW food looked nasty nothing like in another locations.  SAVE UR TIME AND MONEY !!!"}
{"text":"This used to be a reliable place to order from, but as of late when you order online it's hit or miss whether your order will even show up. Twice now we have placed orders only to wait more than an hour without it showing up. When we attempt to track down our order each location blames another location and you never do end up getting your food. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that these orders were already paid for online with a credit card and they still don't show up, but add to it the extremely rude and unhelpful staff and you have a solid no way from me. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal for two via just-eat!! It was perfectly cooked until I came across a sealed packet of nuts with two strands of hair inside!! Complained to just-eat and I was credited for my whole meal...good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Average.  Pad Thai - get ready for ketchup with noodles. Not sure why some Thai places think people won't notice. Not a lot of chicken either   Cashew chicken was average but not delicious."}
{"text":"I would give this a no star if I could. Perhaps they have changed owners! The restaurant was empty the entire hour that we were there. I couldn't tell the lamb from the beef as they were all very chewy.  The waiter was busy watching UFC.  There's no way I'm coming back! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here for a large office meeting (20 ppl)  First of all, the value was incredible! Ridiculous portions, I paid $240 including tax and tip for 2 x 10 ppl meal packages. ($12 per person)  I had enough food leftover to feed a small army, it was truly ridiculous.    The pad Thai was decent and the mango chicken was great too. Fresh rolls and mango salad all good. The other dish, a stirfried eggplant, was really greasy.  The delivery guy was great and it was super punctual. Would totally order again for an office lunch. Cheaper than catered sandwiches."}
{"text":"My new best Thai place in pickering. Excellent flavoring, with a lot more subtle tastes in the soups. Portions are extra large so don't over order dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery - Pad Thai, Fried Tofu & Coconut sticky rice. Their delivery time was outstanding.  That being said, I was not terribly impressed with the food.  The tofu seemed over cooked and the pad thai was starchy.  The coconut rice was tasty, but I don't think I will be ordering here again as I was hit with what I assume to be food poisoning 2 hours later."}
{"text":"I walk by this place quite often and neither the exterior nor the interior has ever lured me in there. On its windows, a giant Justeat.ca is  plastered, which leads me to believe this place is mostly for take-out. Alas, the lack of reviews so far on Yelp in comparison to the abundance of reviews on justeat (over 100) confirms this theory. The like the other reviewer says, they have one of the highest reviews in the M5V area (5 out of 6 stars) so it kinda makes you want to try it out. Well I did, and I was quite disappointed.  First off, it's a bit expensive. $12 for Pad Thai and $12 for Fried Rice equates to $27 after tax. They only deliver if you order $20 before tax. To be fair though, delivery is free and the portions are gigantic. I'm almost tempted to give them a 3 star but honestly the food really doesn't taste all that good. It's very bland and while I was eating it, I made a joke to my boyfriend that I felt like I got transported back to London, eating crappy thai food for more than its worth (which is actually quite unfair because i have had good thai food in london).   Erm, I digress. The point is: - portions are GIANT - taste is MEH (the shrimp was mushy too) - price is on the expensive side  I may order from them again due to the convenience, but definitely not because i want to eat there."}
{"text":"pad thai was soggy. it was bad. other locations prepare good food. good thing i used my GROUPON coupon."}
{"text":"Both items that I ordered for take out was reasonably decent - Chicken devil and Thai Spicy noodles. So 4 stars for quality and 0 stars on quantity - I found it too expensive for the quantity they serve.  What really annoyed me is I ordered take out and had to rush as my car was parked on the street outside and I had to move it or I would've paid more attention to the bill before leaving. They either overcharged me or haven't updated the menu prices. The online menu and their 'current' paper menu that they attach to the brown take out bag doesn't reflect the actual menu prices for items on the bill.   Make sure you confirm prices when you order or you'll get your 'being cheated' feathers ruffled!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. I usually order the green curry chicken or the red curry chicken and one of the soups. Yesterday I tried the hot and sour soup it was flavourful and as usual my green curry chicken with steamed rice was just what I was craving. I would say the food here pretty tasty. I really like the fact that there is some food other than donuts, pizza or hamburgers in the Town. This restaurant is a nice change of pace. The helpings are a decent size and the prices are fair. I find that the wait staff are perhaps... a little shy? They are not rude just timid maybe?  The décor is typical of what you would expect in a Thai restaurant. I will continue to eat here!! YUM!!"}
{"text":"Oodles of noodles.  Malay chicken. Mango rice paper rolls. Crispy rolls. Coconut water. Yep. They know how to cook here, thumbs up."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at Thai One On Kennedy and 14th location in Markham a few years ago. It took me years before I willing to give this franchise a try again.   The deco is quite nice. Remind me of Moxie's and Milestone though the lighting is not as dim. And the booth seatings are really comfy. +0.5 stars  The server is really nice and cheerful. Checked on me a few times if everything is ok and how I enjoy my food +0.5 stars.  They do have a cheaper and more limited lunch menu. The Thai Chicken Noodle ($8.99) which I requested extra spicy is quite good. I have not prepare for its level of spiciness (cough cough cough!) The chicken is nice and tender with tons of bell peppers and onion.  The spiciness is from both fresh chili pepper and hot pepper paste. The generous use of basil leaves gives the dish a little more complexity in taste.   My order took almost 15 minutes to arrive and I am the only one in the restaurant. But at least I know it is freshly stired fried as I can hear the kitchen chopping, wok banding away.  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Amex."}
{"text":"I'm not hard to please but my god! This place isn't good.. Order classic pad Thai and my boyfriend got the chicken... NEVER AGAIN.. it was dry and tasted like ketchup.. I'm so glad I didn't waste my money on anything else.. If you can't get something simple like pad Thai right, I can't imagine anything else being good enough to order.. Fast food places like Thai express is a hundred times better.. The only good thing about this place was that it came with peanuts on the side and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.. Don't go here! Go to coco rice.. Same price and better portions"}
{"text":"It's pretty warm inside Thai One On. When I ventured to the basement lavatories, it was humid and sticky down there. I actually felt like I was entering a Siamese jungle. Authenticity?  Anyway, TOO is a satisfactory Thai and Malay joint by bus station at Bay and Dundas. The inside is clean and spacious with granite-topped tables, a full-wall mirror (not unlike my apartment) and obligatory Buddha heads and elephants.  We walked in late Sunday night to find only one other booth occupied in the entire restaurant.  We shared the vegetarian platter which came with fried tofu, mango salad, spring rolls, salad rolls, and for-no-reason-whatsoever samosas. The platter was good and filling. My date's spicy eggplant was tasty but my pad Thai was weak.  Overcooked chicken and lacking in flavor.  I might try this place again, but I wasn't wowed by the food. Service was slow, but hardly torture.  Obligatory Title Pun: Fit to be THAI'd.  Menu Readability: Pretty decent design actually. Effective use of chili pepper icons.  Need to mention: They deliver in the core.  What this place teaches me about myself: Is it just me, or do salad rolls resemble a condom stuffed with lettuce? (It's just me.)"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Thai one on and love their food.  Usually get the pad Thai, samosas and deep fried tofu which is yummy.  Plus it's great that it's free delivery for orders $20 and up before taxes.   Great place to have some decent Thai food for sure"}
{"text":"Last visit. Ever. Another groupon and one more chance - methinks I'm done here.  1. The order - devil chicken, extra spicy, no sweet peppers in it. I repeated this request 3 times. The result - 1/5 of the food container was loaded with dry hot chili peppers. There were bits of sweet red, green and yellow peppers in the food which indicates to me that food is not made from scratch as they claim but rather pre prepared and someone must have removed chunks of unwanted peppers. Ridiculous amount of chili peppers made it impossible to eat - I mean I like my food spicy but there is such a thing as powdered hot chili! After I put aside most of them there was not much to eat left. 2. As above - not much to eat. First couple groupons there was a generous, heaping portion of food - yesterday there was hardly half of container: mostly dry chili, lots of onions, two small pieces of broccoli, 3 tiny pieces of baby corn, few stripes of chicken swimming in a sweet sauce.  3. Unfair practice number one - without groupon you get rice free with your dish - with groupon you pay for it. 4. Unfair practice number 2 - should you order food worth less than $30 they would tax you on $30."}
{"text":"I've ordered for delivery from Thai On One a few times over the years and have never been disappointed *knock on wood*. As I'm just reading the other reviews I'm shocked everyone is so upset with their service. Portions are great size, enough food to have leftovers the next day, and it always tastes good."}
{"text":"Great little place for Thai food and takeout! They give you a lot of food for a great place! My meal was $12 after tax for chicken coconut mango curry and rice! I have enough left overs for tonight.   I would have to say that the place has no place to sit so it's only good for takeout! You can always ask for your food extra spicy!   They take credit cards, debit and cash!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai through UberEats and it was horrible. Did not even taste like Pad Thai! I asked for more tofu and only got tiny cubes. There were so many vegetables in the pad Thai that you don't normally see in there. (e.g. carrots, broccoli, baby corn, bok choy, snow peas and so much more)! It was such a waste of food, I couldn't even finish it because of how horrible it tasted! Another thing I ordered was the chicken satay skewers. It was warm and bland, it's like they just \"grilled\" it and served it. The skewers were sitting on a bed of lettuce with lemon and orange...random. The peanut sauce did not even taste like peanut at all. It tasted more like the sweet chilli sauce you guy from the grocery stores that you use for spring rolls. This was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp it was a big portion, but he chicken and shrimp were  dry and over cooked, and I found it had a lot more tofu that was really needed.  The pad thai sauce tasted more like just plain old ketchup.. the dish was too sweet over all and missed the contrast of sally, sweet, and pungent that you normally find with pad thai..  the price was a little too high for this quality of food.    The restaurant seems new in the area, so perhaps they are going through some fine tuning.."}
{"text":"Summary: Been here twice. Bad Pad Thai, ok curry, a bit expensive. Probabaly would never come back again. Not recommended. On Queen Street West, there are so many good and cheap food places. To me, with the same price, I would probabaly go Pai instead here. Each time I entered the restaurant, it was pretty much empty, with one waitor there. The Pad Thai is too sweet. The chicken golden curry was OK, but I felt the meat is unseasoned and they put too much meat. The curry costs about 20. With same money, I got so many choices nearby."}
{"text":"Ordered online from here tonight - got an entree (Thai Spicy Coconut Eggplant) with apps and a drink. Was very difficult to eat as it came without rice, which was not noted anywhere in the ordering process. SO disappointing. WHen we called to complain they told us it was our own fault. Really bad service. Won't order again."}
{"text":"Do not order the delivery. They smashed the food ...the soup are all over the food and bags...My green curry's every food...when I opened the bags...it was a dog food...since then not going there at all"}
{"text":"Seating options are banquettes or booths. Décor is modern Thai. This location is in a strip mall.   We went for lunch on a weekday. Our server was the only staff member whom we saw. She had to deal with dine-in and take-out customers. She listened to my allergies and checked my menu selections with the kitchen. My dish arrived with one of my allergens on it. The kitchen said that it was something else, but it was only a tiny piece and I was being hosted by a friend, so I didn't cause a fuss. Still, The kitchen should have admitted it's mistake; another person with a more serious reaction to the same allergen could have been in trouble.  My pad Thai was acceptable. My friend liked her green curry chicken. Large portions. Prices were reasonable. They have discounts on samosas and spring rolls at lunch, but should consider offering standard lunch specials that include soup, salad or an appetizer for a set price.   I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This is my go to take out place for Thai food and they never ever disappoint! I have been ordering from them consistently for the past 3 years for both delivery and pick up and my meals have always been piping hot, fresh, flavourful, and delicious.  My standard order items are  Green Mango Salad - Fresh mango, coriander, red onions, sweet peppers, peanuts with a sweet chilli dressing Soo yummy and fresh. The mango is perfectly sweet and sour, lots of crunch from the crushed roasted peanuts and whole roasted cashews, the light dressing provides just a hint of heat that makes this a very well rounded flavourful salad.  Chicken Pad Thai - Thai rice noodles stir-fried and tossed with a piquant tamarind sauce, egg, and tofu. Garnished with green onion, lemon, and roasted peanuts. Perfect balance of sweet and sour, lightly sauced without being too dry or wet, huge strips of white meat chicken and chunks of tofu mixed in. Really flavourful! You get a separate container of crushed peanuts so everyone can get an ample sprinkling on their plate.  Thai one on Chicken Fried Rice - Special house flavoured rice mixed with green onion, red pepper slice, basil leaves and egg Subtly spicy but really flavourful with huge strips of white meat chicken mixed in.  Ginger Chicken - Sliced chicken breast with shredded ginger, mushrooms, sweet peppers, and onions Nice juicy strips of white meat in a light sauce with ample pieces of fresh stir fried ginger. This is a very fresh tasting meat dish that's not too heavy but really full of flavour.  Beef Devil - Lightly deep fried beef with onion, sweet peppers, and sweet and spicy sauce Nice chunks of tender beef with a crunchy crispy coating and covered in that sweet syrupy sauce that has a nice kick of heat in the background. This dish also has fresh spears of stir fried broccoli and red and yellow bell peppers.  I always add an order of steamed rice for only 1.00 because none of the dishes come with rice. Also if you spend over $50 before tax (which I always do) you get a free chicken pad thai!  For a takeout chain restaurant this place really surpasses my expectations. Customer service is always top notch, I have phoned in an order and then called back to change or add something on more than one occasion and they have fixed it instantly without hesitation. Some might say prices are a bit high but your getting quality ingredients that are super fresh and the portions are HUGEEEE. I will continue to be a repeat customer for years to come!"}
