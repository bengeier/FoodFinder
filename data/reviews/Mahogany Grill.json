{"text":"I was stranded at the airport and the lobby looked cozier than Tim Horton's. The wine was great. The salmon was ok. The swarm of fruit flies was infuriating."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times in the past but not recently. The food was always decent but not outstanding. What reminded me why I don't dune here more often when staying at this hotel is the complete lack of service. I sat for a significant time before approached by a server to take my order. Furthermore from the time I ordered until my food arrived was again very long. The server set down my meal and ran away. I noticed right away something was missing but my server was no where to be seen and I couldn't bare waiting any longer for fear of starvation.  The server never once came to check on me or whether everything was well with my meal. My French fries were cold but I was too hungry to care. For the price you pay in combination with the lack of service and so so quality of the food it is not worth spending your hard earned dollars here."}
{"text":"This place is located on the same level at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel. Most hotel guests come to eat here.
 
Visited this place in the morning for breakfast while in Toronto before my flight to Calgary. Was seated promptly and advised the waiter I was catching a flight and needed to be done in the next 45 minutes. He assured me it was no problem and would be back in a few minutes. Ordered coffee and juice and looked over the menu quickly. Not a huge selection on breakfast so I settled for the egg white spinach omelette with fruit on the side. Waited for my waiter to return and he didn't so I flagged down a waitress. Advised her I needed to order since I was catching a flight.  She told me she would let him know. I waited again and he finally showed up. No apologizes. I ordered quickly and told him he could also bring the bill when the food was ready since I wanted to take care of things quickly as possible, so I could run for my flight.
 
Food was good but the service wasn't great/good or even okay.  Even after my food arrived, I still hadn't received the bill I requested. Once again I flagged down an employee walking by and asked if my bill could be brought. When it finally was, the waiter left it at the table and I advised him I wanted to pay for it right away. At this point he left to get the interact machine, which took forever. I'm not sure why since the place wasn't busy. Just some people having breakfast or meetings. After some frustration of waiting, I just went to the front to ask if I could pay since I urgently needed to go. Not an enjoyable experience at all.
 
Next time I will avoid this place since breakfast for one shouldn't take this long or to get service. Not to mention I expressed that I was in a hurry as soon as I sat down, which no one seemed to care? Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I really like the quality of the food you should try the 4lb medium well ribeye."}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted and seated nicely. Sat for about 8 minutes without even an offer of water (and they weren't busy). That's as far as I let it go."}
{"text":"My flight was canceled and I'm a captive in the airport. I tried the Sheraton   Mahogany Grill, oops. I ordered the ribeye steak med-rare and it came well done. I set it back and got a steak that was medium rare on one side and medium on the other... Not impressed."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but pretty uneven food. Couldn't get a fork through the grilled feta and got a sheet of plastic or maybe wax paper wrapped around one of  my chicken wings. They struck it from the bill. 

Only option at the hotel, I suppose."}
{"text":"Visited this place the morning after we arrived into toronto since when we booked our room with Sheraton there was an option to get free breakfast. Food was okay but the service was shit. The servers knew we had the breakfast tickets and pushed each other to wait our table while they asked other tables that came in after if they needed any water or coffee. Anyone booking a room at the Sheraton I highly do not recommending the meal option with the room."}
{"text":"Spend a week at the hotel for business and used the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner/drinks. The breakfast area had tables and booths. If you are looking for speed don't order :) the staff is friendly however not tailored to get you in and out quickly. I find the prices extremely steep even for an airport hotel. If you sign up for the free loyalty program you can get a 10% discount. Make sure you tell the staff and check your bill because they won't ask you for it. And ask for the bill when they bring the food saves you ten minutes! 

The egg whites omelet was the best healthy option. The oatmeal was ok. My waiter ask if I wanted berries with it. I said sure! Later on I saw on the bill the berries were 14 dollars!!! The oatmeal was 10. I mentioned that if the addition is 1,5 times the price of my order you need to tell me. They gave me a discount however I felt cheated. The hot tea is very oversteeped. So make sure you ask for the bag on the side if that's not your style.

The bar area is spacious, and the staff there is more attentive. They refill your ice tea (tad bland) over 5 times with a smile (trust me I'm an avid tea drinker). For dinner I decided to go light and order the shrimp spinach salad. It was tasty AND healthy. Portion was filling. Again quite pricey."}
{"text":"Would not come back here for food in a million years.

Limited choices of decent food in Pearson airport, left me no choice. It's either Wendy's or this overpriced low quality steak.

Saddest thing is customer service was below average as well. Server came to ask about the food and I commented food was extremely salty, he provided a Starbucks paper up of hot water for me to wash off salt in my vegetables and steak.

*** decided to change the review***
A server possibly realized it was odd with that paper Starbucks hot water and came to inquire, upon realizing situation he has flagged his manager. Manager was kind enough to comp the less than 1/3 eaten steak and suggested a burger + salad.

Food is still just okay, but at least they made an effort; this will be a place for a quick bite but don't have your hopes too high."}
