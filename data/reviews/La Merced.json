{"text":"I went here twice last week and am about to go for lunch again today. (I've got my co-workers hooked now too) I've had their Tacos and Quesadillas so far and I absolutely love this place! The young lady at the front is always friendly and the owner too... I'm surprised to read the negative reviews about service on here- I've not had a bad experience yet! So what if this place isn't a chips & salsa type restaurant, there are many Mexican food places that aren't, they make up for it with large portions and great flavor. I'm so happy that this place is just up the street!"}
{"text":"First, I have to say, totally not what I expected. I guess I expected a Filiberto's experience. Instead I walked through the door and they offered to seat me. The place was very quaint but well laid out for it's size. However, I decided to get my food to go as I was in a bit of a rush today.   I ordered the \"La Merced\" signature house torta and a large horchata. The horchata which is a Mexican rice drink, was outstanding. Best horchata I have had in years. When I was handed my food, I thought something was wrong. The box weighed as much as a half gallon of milk. I went to my truck and could not wait till i got home to see what was in the box of food she gave me.  I opened the box and my eyes popped out. It was the sandwich from hell. Now I admit I am caucasian and have tried most of the Americanized Mexican food joints and I like  the Filiberto's  type places too, but this was a whole new something different.  The menu stated that the sandwich had chorizo, eggs, ham, sausage, and chicken on it.   I was thinking YES BREAKFAST SANDWICH... Wow was i wrong.  What I got was this HUGE Bun that was Super Tasty. On it was mayo, pico, guac, a chorizo, egg and chease omlete. Couple slabs of ham, Some weird chicken fried steak looking thingy, and 3 hot dogs split in half and grilled.  I laughed my butt off looking at this thing. This looked like something one of my stoner friends would have come up with during a case of the munchies.  I decided I had to take a bite and I have to say.  I was impressed. The bun especially is very good. I was a fan of everything except the hot dogs and chicken fried steak looking strips.  Just to be clear I am not a big hot dog fan to begin with so I cant take a star off for that.. Over all the Sandwich  taste was about 3 stars. The horchatta was 5 stars. The staff was very nice, 4 stars.    So all in all I have to give it 4 starts for a Huge Meal at a decent price, Prompt courteous service, and excellent house made Horchata"}
{"text":"I wouldn't bother to go back, but if you want decent Mexican food in that neighborhood it's alright.  Nice enough inside, except for two big TVs in the dining room (actually 3, but the one at the back was not turned on), one TV right above our head blaring a movie in Spanish.  The other TV was blaring a soccer game, and the sound on the TV was broken, going in and out.  It's bad enough to have the flashing TV in your peripheral vision, but two different soundtracks going on, plus people talking and crying kids made us wish we'd asked for takeout and sat out in the car to eat our food.   It was a drag sitting in there.  The food was average.  I had the carnitas and my husband had the flautas.  Lots of food, but not that flavorful.  Rosita's (on McDowell in central Phoenix) has carnitas that are 500% better."}
{"text":"Noms.  Open late, always smells fantastic, exceptionally clean, lots of Latino locals (always important when looking for good south-of-the-border grubs).  Horchata IS fantastic here, as is portion size and did I mention nom?    Had the .. er, 'La' Merced, wasn't sure about an omelette in a sandwich but I'm now a believer.  While I've only been here but once, its apparent this is much better than your average Mexican restaurant in the valley, and I rate nothing on Yelp unless it deserves it.   The family proprietors obviously take great pride in their homemade food and it shows, we've all been to Fili's and such and while I can't possibly complain about Super Nachos! this seems to be an orthodoxed church of authentic Mexican grub.   Even though the establishment is a smallish joint it's cleaner than any McDonald's I've ever been in and the love that goes into the food is apparent.  I was only there for a bit to pick up some food for the late night muchies but still got homemade chips and salsa (real salsa, ie don't bring grandma or those cousins from Ohio as they will whine about the heat) and even got to watch some Univision.    TL;DR: Eat here, it's good."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was HORRIBLE. As we finished our meal, I put my knee on the booth seat. I'm in flip flops and shorts. The owner came and told me to remove my dirty feet from HIS seat. My feet weren't on the seat. He proceeded to argue with me and told me this was his place and to remove my feet because it was unhealthy. I'm not a dirty person, and to be called out publicly that way was rude and unprofessional.   I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I've been looking for authentic Mexican food and I was told that this place was legit.  I was looking for authentic barbacoa and this place has it on the weekends.  I tried several tacos, sopes and the barbacoa (I'd course) and everything was just ok.  It's with the visit but wouldn't crave it.  The horchata was the best thing they had and was a little too sweet for me.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious.  Lot's of menu options.  Even gluten free stuff.  Aguas frescas and licuados were amazing."}
{"text":"It is a hole in a wall. I was impressed. I had their ribs, it came with a nice red sauce. The portions a big (as expected in a Mexican restaurant). Simple, authentic Mexican.  I would agree w the Music comment. It is a little odd. They had music and a Mexican soap opera playing at the same time. Lol, 2 TV on. I needed to answer some important phone calls, they turned down the TV for me, so I would say they are accommodating.  The food is good, ambiance is odd but hey, my belly was happy and full. Next time I will try their mole."}
{"text":"Service was a little awkward today, but the food is always delicious. I had the enchiladas with beef and my friend had the chicken flautas.  The portions are SUPER generous.  We both ate half our plates and were REALLY full, the kind of full that almost hurts.  The horchata is rich and delicious.  I recommend having it as dessert rather than a beverage.  I don't particularly like the sweet flavor while I eat savory food."}
{"text":"Excellent e servisio un lugar limpio y la comida muy deliciosa ....congrats to the owner!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here to support a local business vs. going to a chain restaurant. The waitresses didn't know anything about anything on the menus. I guess they're new.  My entree was 3 eggs, burnt at the bottom, raw on top (how did they do that?)  These eggs were on top of a pound of soggy tortilla chips in verde sauce with bits of sour cream floating around. not a joke. I tried eating it, I think I got through 2 eggs and a few spongy chips in my mouth before I stopped.  The waitress told me that it's because this is 'real' Mexican food. I'd bet the entire 10% off coupon she gave me before I left that it's not."}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars. Their menudo is delicious; it is one of my favorite plates. Also, the tacos al pastor are some of the best I have had.   I love coming for their food.  The service could be better. It's a 3 star service wise."}
{"text":"Avoid this place the manager or person in charge has horrible service and refuses to refund or give a discount on bad  service and discusting food. The Chilaquiles ordered tasted like Marianara sauce and we're so soft and watered down we wonder if they were fresh with little to no cheese.   Then he had the nerve to say \" It's because your white bro\". We waited 20 min to sit, had to walk up to the front and ask for refills, never got an entree and he had the nerve to argue with us about the food."}
{"text":"Had some great priced tasty street tacos. Great flavor and salsa. Plan to come back and try more next time. Sunday was packed wall to wall...customers don't lie  @  LOL."}
{"text":"Food is good! Service is horrible! Need more front of house staff for greets and check backs!"}
{"text":"OK...this is my first time here, and I'm only buying a fruit cocktail to go (got hungry after the gym), but the whole menu looks delicious and everyone else's food looks delicious! Can't wait to cone back and try it!  They were extremely friendly, too."}
{"text":"Outstanding Tacos here I highly recommend this place to everyone who loves good Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Always solid food! The tortas are the best in the east valley. They are huge! I'm only able to eat half of the torta and the flavor is amazing. One of only two places I go for tortas."}
{"text":"Ordered online... 1.5 hours later they call to get my location.. The driver was no where near my location.  The restaurant offered nothing. 2 hours later the driver gets there with cold food!  I sent it back and got my money back"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service however was horrible. We waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and then they brought out our food and they didn't give us any silverware or napkins. Their \"ensalada rusa\" was so disgusting. The service here was the worst. NEVER COMING BACK AND NOT RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE TO ANYONE"}
{"text":"Solid, family-run Mexican food place with massive portions.  The DF-style tacos are exactly what you'd expect and at $1.40, they beat the $2+ tacos at Los Taquitos (used to LOVE this place until they jacked the prices) and America's Taco Shop (which I never liked and like even less now that they are run by franchisees).  Although I am a taco al pastor nut and they claim it is a specialty, the pastor is only so-so.  This is my only knock on the place.  I suspect it is because they don't shave the pastor into your tortilla right off the spit.  They cook it on a spit, chop it, chill it, and then reheat it on the flat top just like the other guys.  Today I had the house torta.  It is absolutely enormous and only $10.  I immediately decided that at best I'd be eating 1/2 and taking the other half (and I'm 6'1\" 210lbs).  Doesn't hurt that it's also delicious: egg, ham, breaded pork topped by 4 hot dogs, cheese, avocado, etc.  They actually have a challenge where if you can eat this torta and down one of their massive shakes (bomba de leche) in 30 minutes, they'll pay you $500.  Needless to say, they aren't worried about having to pay up.  But where La Merced really shines is in the family plates.  They are massive, fresh, and unbelievably flavorful. You get 1.5 POUNDS of meat, 2 humongous sides and all the tortillas and fixings you can handle for about $18.  I don't think you could make it yourself for that.  Last time we went for dinner, we fed 6 people and took home some leftovers ... insane."}
{"text":"Seriously,  great food, good enchiladas, good pastor, good Carne asada. Jugos naturales, nom nom. The food is actually spicy, like how it's supposed to be. I would prefer it hotter but this place is spicier than most. Oh yeah I forgot,  GREAT SALSA!"}
{"text":"The house special torta is huge! The sopes and chicken mole are delicious too.  Great little place that most people don't know about."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Hidden gem in the City of Mesa as it is hidden on the side of Extension Rd. My friend recommended this place as she is quite knowledgeable in where to eat the best \"Mexican Foods\" in town. Enjoyed this place so much went there the second time in two days.Had tacos the first night, and tortas the next night. And I have to say is quite big and most importantly delicious! Friend thought I wasn't going to finish it, but proved her wrong (brought the inner fat boy in me-hehe!). Had a 30-minute challenge of who could finish a whole torta, and if the contestant is successful torta is on the house. Might try it one day as I believe I can do it. Overall, loved this place and will definitely come back for a third, fourth, and fifth time until I get tiresome of tortas and tacos. :)"}
{"text":"First, im from Mexico City, and i know the flavor of my hometown, you got it.   We \"chilangos\" (ppl  from mexico city) love TTT, tortas, tamales, tacos, and this place have the best flavor, clean,  with memorabilia from the city all around the place, weekends you can enjoy a \"toquin\" music party, enjoy the food for long time,   i will definitely recomend this place to all people who want to eat the real food from Mexico City....   Felicidades, excelente servicio y siempre muy limpio"}
{"text":"When I feel like great mexican food, this place is as good as it gets, and I'm not even mexican (I'm central american).   Whether its weekend or weekday for lunch, La Merced NEVER disappoints me.  Today I had a Chicken Mole plate and it was DELISH!  My second favorite dish here, during lunch rush, is 4 street tacos (2 lengua and 2 asada).    The drinks are amazing too.  You can have an Horchata or a fruit drink that is blended right there while you wait.  I have a friend that always has to have the Strawberry water (without cream).    The prices are decent, and the staff is always very friendly.  Some days I get an extra treat, and get to watch the Barcelona football match on TV.    Today there was a gentleman playing guitar during lunch hour (on a weekend), and he played a Maná song for my cousin and I.  I had a great lunch, watching soccer, listening to great music, and enjoying a great Mole.    Keep up the work you guys.  For anyone not familiar with non-northern mexican food, this place has Mexico City Style mexican food...I would definitely recommend it.  Who knows, someday you may be qualified to try the Torta Gigante.  Which I've only had once because it is a huge deal."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I frequent La Frontera Taco truck and a few taco trucks in LA, and I was looking for something comparable on the east side.  Unfortunately this is not the place for me.  The carne asada taco was disappointing.  The meat was slightly overcooked with charred edges and tasted stale.  As with La Frontera, the carne asada was not particularly well-marinated.  I noticed Shawna M's pictures with an abundance of cilantro topping her tacos, so I was quite disappointed when mine showed up with about half of that amount.  The carnitas taco was different.  I'm used to carnitas being pulled into strands.  The carnitas (if that's what I ordered and received) on my taco was chopped into chunks; wiki says it's legit, so I'm not complaining.  Mike R noted that his carnitas tacos were crispy, and I'm assuming he meant the meat...mine was not.  The burrito al pastor was also interesting.  The tortilla was noticeably greasy to the point of appearing translucent in some spots.  There was what tasted like a bland chili-based sauce throughout the burrito.  It was not particularly spicy nor tasty but had a pleasant hint of pineapple.  The meat itself was not noteworthy.  I love having radishes with my tacos and burritos, but again, an emerging theme here is stale/old.  They were dried on the edges and appeared to have been prepared a few too many hours/days before being served.  The cucumbers, however, were crisp.    They were generous with the salsa: my 1 burrito and 2 tacos were accompanied by 4 salsa containers.  The same amount of salsa at certain trucks in LA would cost a whole dollar(note the sarcasm).  However, the salsa was not spicy at all.  Maybe it's the way their salsa is supposed to taste, but I'll try asking for something spicier if there is a next time.    This review only covers the small sampling of what this restaurant had to offer, but I tend to stick with tacos and burritos so I probably won't be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Since I started working in Mesa I have been looking for good tacos, a co worker suggested this place and man was he right! I've had carne asada and Al Pastor tacos that both times were amazing! I will try a huarache next time which I also hear are very good. It's in a little strip mall that you would never see if you didn't go looking for it. Service is good and quick."}
{"text":"Hard to like or dislike this place.  The dessert (flan) and beverages (horchata) were outstanding, the rest of the meal below average. Taco's were small street size taco's and the carne asada burrito was filled with a lot of beans. Service was good and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Food was okay. My tacos where dry. The horchata was good. Every One working here looks extremely unhappy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have only eaten the tortas.  I'm certain it's all good but, because the tortas are so good, I never want to pass up the opportunity and miss out so it's all I've ordered. Que rica la comida!  Aquí, hay que comer!"}
{"text":"Kind of a hidden gem, though somewhat flawed.  They have excellent enchiladas, but you have to buy a plate, and can't buy 1-2 or at a time.  Burritos and tacos are also very good.   Friendly owner.  Service can be a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"It's been a couple weeks since I ate here, but not a day has passed that I havent stopped craving those Pineapple Al Pastor Tacos. So spicy, sweet, & savory. I can't wait to have a few of these again with some of their beautiful crispy carnitas tacos.   I also tried the torta since that seems to be the focus of this place, but it was very underwhelming. Just because it's big that doesnt make it good.  The carne asada is definitely not their best meat in the building and the bun could have been greatly improved.  Don't waste your time and appetite on it.  Stick with the tacos.    The pricing is fair, the service awfully slow, the average horchata comes from a machine, but omg those tacos be hittin'."}
{"text":"Life. Changing.    That is all the description I can give. The deserts, sandwiches the entrées even the drinks. The portions? If you can finish just HALF of the La Merced Sandwich you are a beast.   The service is very good. Your server will notice if you are done with your menu or if your drink is low.   This is not Sanoran Style, which is great, too, but omg I am like a pregnant woman about this place.   I am sad (but full) when I leave. I memorized the address to this place the first time I found it. I am not the guy that remembers things like that, trust me.    It makes me want to move to Mexico City."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food (my burrito was very good and HUGE), 4 for the service, 5 for the cleanliness, and 1.5 for the ambiance. As mentioned elsewhere, there are 2 TVs in the very small dining area, and both were blaring obnoxiously loud volume levels, showing a Mexican drama of some sort. Really, really inappropriate, especially in such a small space. Other than that annoyance, I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Clean and quick service. Waitress is very nice and food is delicious. Came here for the Tortas, it was as good as I remember. Breakfast of champions! Good luck eating it all in one sitting. Ask about the challenge. :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this shitty place a -stars I would!! We came in to buy some Mexican food and just 3 huaraches was $35.00. I told the lady to cancel the order and she said I can't once you order that's it. I told I just placed the order and she said I'm sorry but I can't cancel it. Some rude jackass which I think was the manager came up and he said you can't cancel I said why I just placed my order a second ago and he said this is not like McDonald's you can't just cancel.  He made a scene in front of other customers and I was so embarrassed. I'm from California and Ian used to great Mexican food and I was just giving this guy a chance. I will never go there again. Avoid this horrible rude place!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Small local place, not easy to find.  But well worth the effort.  Had a carne asada torta, chicken enchilada and quesadilla to share between two people.  It was a lot of food...and it was all good.  This is one of those places that really makes me wonder how chain mexican restaurants attract customers...let alone stay in business."}
{"text":"Came in looking for some Mexican City food, and they got it!   I ordered the Huarache with Al Pastor which was huge AND delicious. The inside was real simple, but i go to a restaurant for the food so i didnt really care.   I recommend this place if you're tired of wannabe Mexican restaurants that typically offer the same fake americanized version of the real deal!!"}
