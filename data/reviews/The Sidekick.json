{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever gone. to say the service is pretty pretty good the food is amazing and their coffee is the best I've ever tasted their cookies are delicious I could go on but you should visit yourself"}
{"text":"Definitely in my top two favourite coffee shops in the neighbourhood. Great coffee, very friendly staff, good vibe, solid baked goods, tea by the pot, with the added bonus of being able to browse comics, and laugh at hilarious jokes on the sandwich board outside."}
{"text":"On my first visit here I knew I'd be back again soon.  The concept alone is a combination of my favourite things, coffee and comix, so just hearing about it got my attention. Being here is something else entirely; the shop is spacious and beautifully decorated, the comic and graphic novel selection is modest but extremely well curated, and other novelties like action figures and Jayne Cobb hats are waiting to be taken home! I purchased a couple graphic novels and several single issues on this first visit, plus a cold brew coffee which was absolutely delicious and refreshing! A nice touch is a small selection of board games you can play in house!  Probably the biggest draw of this place is that the entrance is wheelchair accessible! The Silver Snail downtown is much closer to me but my boyfriend and I have to take our business elsewhere (and believe me, absurd amounts of our income goes toward coffee and comix books!!). The Sidekick is the winner on this front and we will be spending our well earned dollars here in the future!  If you are a comix/coffee fan, you must visit this adorable Leslieville gem! The service, merch, and atmosphere will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Came here one Sunday morning and had the most delicious cookie and soy latte. There is something about their soy lattes that are smooth and tasty. I typically hate soy lattes but this one tasted like a regular milk latte, which is rare.  Music is soft and not jarring, so I could hear my conversation partner easily and could also ready a nice book by the big window."}
{"text":"Great new spot at Queen & Greenwood! Chris, the owner/barista has combined her two passions - comics and coffee. I can only comment on the caffeinated side of the business...she knows her espresso! Using Cut beans, supplied and roasted by Sam James, and a borrowed espresso machine (hers is still at customs), she turned out an excellent cortado. Coming from working at at least 2 other local coffee shops, Chris knows what she's doing.   The space is comfortable and gorgeous, and the goodies delicious. Having only been open for a couple of weeks, this place is really well thought out and put together. The comics are neatly displayed on custom racks.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this Queen Street East/Leslieville gem. There are too few decent comic shops in the east end of toronto and now The Sidekick has stepped up to counter that lack. Combine a kickass comic shop with a great coffee shop and you get Nerdvana!  Located conveniently at Queen Street East and Greenwood Ave, the eclectic shop is not cluttered and there is plenty of table space for reading and sipping, and the coffee is top notch too.   Check them out at Www.thesidekickcomics.com."}
{"text":"Clean, quiet and orderly. Refreshing that you don't have to pay extra for alternative milk. Small selection of vegan baked goods from Tori's Bakeshop are available so you don't have to trek to the far east end. Admittedly I'm not a comic book fan, so the concept is lost on me."}
{"text":"I visited The Sidekick quite recently for the first time with a friend, exploring Leslieville, and I was quite pleased. This is an enjoyable new space indeed, with plenty of the latest comic books and graphic novels for sale across a spacious room from a good menu of coffees and snacks, with plenty of comfortable seating in a family-friendly environment for people to hang."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place a few times and finally decided to try it out. Glad I did! So good to see that they're serving up Cut Coffee as I'm a huge fan. I got an americano and blueberry lemon scone which was pretty good. The coffee, of course, was great and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Good coffee & snacks, lots of seating, racks of comics & graphic novels, and it still feels open and roomy. Great for hangouts or getting some work done on your laptop."}
{"text":"Really cute coffee shop/comic book store. Friendly staff, lots of selection for teas and coffees and plenty of space to sprawl out. Their earl grey blend was one of the best that I've had in a while. It was a loose leaf that is sweet. I will definitely be hitting this place up again and bringing friends when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"In a far far far part of my neighbourhood, hey, what's this? It's a coffee shop! It's a comic book shop! It's... both?  The Sidekick is another unique east end cafe that saves the day by diligently combines geeky comics love in a cool, hip, totally unpretentious kinda way. It's a great quiet wide open place with all sorts of seating space where even non-geeks can spend some time at comfortably.  Unavoidably, I flipped through the comics and merch they had, and while it is not floor-to-ceiling Silver Snail level of inventory, there are plenty of material for all ages (much it seems for younger folks), the usual superheroes stuff as well as many graphic novel series and lesser known works being featured.  Man, I wish I did not discover this by driving around, but I also wish this secret weapon of a gem wasn't such a long walk from home. Maybe I'll gain some teleportation skills or something.  {TTC: Queen cars or Greenwood buses to where Queen Street and Greenwood meet}"}
{"text":"great concept, execution and decor. the coffee is fantastic and so is the selection of comics and collectables"}
{"text":"What a great little place!  Good coffee (8/10, but I'm a coffee nut) and great people. Have only been in business 3 months and I wish them many more."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are coffee fanatics and love to trying them all out. When we heard a new cafe had opened up close to us we had to go and pay a visit.   Great coffee and the baked goodies looked delicious (even though we didn't buy any) and the ambience was very chill. I would highly recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"Super wonderful atmosphere! Love their coffee and teas. One of my favourites is definitely the vegan donuts (from Tori's Bakeshop) and the scones!"}
{"text":"I met my friend, Trish, this afternoon at The Sidekick.  It's a cozy spot.  In addition to being a coffee shop, it's also a comic book store.  I ordered a raspberry lemon scone and a hot chocolate.  Both were delicious!  Harrison was my server.  He was friendly and chatty and took excellent care of me."}
{"text":"Adorable space, best latte in Leslieville and the kindest staff you will ever encounter!"}
{"text":"Très chouette endroit. Les cafés et pâtisseries (aussi végétaliennes) sont excellents et à un prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"Guys, guuuuuys, guys!!!! I can't tell you how happy I was that this place opened up. Every morning I secretly hope I miss my streetcar so I can go in for a latte and every time I go in there's a new awesome thing on the shelves (Jane Hats! Buttons! All the comics ever!). And everyone is awesome! EVERYTHING IS AWESOME! This place is awesome. May I miss many streetcars."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and great coffee. Just found this place around the corner from my office - I'll definitely be back! Had a flat white and gingerbread cookie and they both really hit the spot."}
{"text":"It was my first time there this weekend, and wow, this place is super chill. Huge windows gives it a super spacious feel, racks of comic books and swag on one side of the cafe, and hella amazing coffee, why did it take so long for TO to have something like this?"}
{"text":"This is the kind of cafe you'd want in your neighborhood - quiet (I went on a late weekday afternoon), unpretentious, friendly, and full of reading material. I can imagine coming here at a busier time and having a conversation with a stranger about books and comics while sipping coffee or tea - something I doubt you can do in Vancouver.  I didn't notice anything suspect about the americano I had as the quality was on par with ones I normally have. The decor and layout of the cafe were appropriate for the concept, but don't expect anything too fancy. Te Aro might be more suitable for those looking for a more \"Instagrammable\" cafe in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Great space. Very good coffee. Pastries are from a vegan bakery up to road. I wish they were open in the evening!"}
