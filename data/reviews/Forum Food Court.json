{"text":"Great place for an inexpensive quick bite. Located at Caesars Palace forum food court. Different $ options such as Smashburger, Difari Pizza, Phillips Seafood Express, Earl of Sandwich, Tiger Wok & Ramen, La Gloria Mexican, & Romaine Empire (create your own salad). 

Great for people staying at the hotel because its inexpensive (compared to Vegas prices) & open until 11pm. Most of the restaurants in Caesars are upscale so this is an affordable alternative. 

I had the Holiday Turkey: wheat hoagie w/ turkey, dressing, & cranberry sauce. Also had broccoli cheddar soup. Tasty."}
{"text":"Earl sandwiches is a great place to eat they have wraps sandwiches soups cookies drinks chips and more u get to injoy a combo with a drink and a chip with a sandwich that you will injoy to eat very friendly  and  helpful  people  to serve you the best ."}
{"text":"I highly recommend earl sandwich. They have the best chipotle sandwich by far.  Ambiance of the food court looks great and spacious. And many options to choose from.. (We look forward to trying some more food from there)..
Also The staff were very friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Actually one of the better food court in a casino.  Many choices from chain to non-chain.  I only come in here for ice cream or a drink.  While studying the menus of the walk up counters, I see nothing that would make me want a meal here."}
{"text":"For a food court it might be hard to find a better one and if you do will it be as easily accessible"}
{"text":"Great value and selection of items to choose from. Easy to find at Caesars Palace. Great find on a budget."}
{"text":"If you want something quick and doesn't mind to have something that you eat everyday, then the food court is a great option!  We went to a very popular restaurant hoping to have some yummy breakfast, however the line is very long so we decided to go to somewhere else, and ended up we are at the food court because everywhere is busy.  Thank you Caesar to have such a food court in this very very busy area!"}
{"text":"Food good has a Starbucks, Philips seafood, a Di Fara pizza, Earl of Sandwich, Smash Burger and some asian good eats here.  It's good but super expensive i thought but hey you on the strip."}
{"text":"The food court has a lot of choices like Mexican, seafood, Thai/Chinese, pizza and more. A couple of chain restaurants like Starbucks, Earl Of Sandwich and Smashburger. It is spacious and clean. It can get busy, so leave yourself time to get through the lines."}
{"text":"We went to Phillips Seafood and had the seafood sample and calamari platter.  Both were very tasty..  The food court had a diverse selection (sandwiches, mexican, seafood, pizza/burger and ramen) and is one of the best I had been to.  Price is on the higher side and lots of clean tables for seating."}
{"text":"Diverse selection of fast food places here.  Had never tried any of them before our stay with the exception of Starbucks.  DiFara Pizza, Earl of Sandwich,  Smash Burger,  Phillips Seafood,  Tiger Wok & Ramen, and La Gloria are the other headliners at the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace.

During our stay at Caesars, we ate from Smash Burger and Earl of Sandwich.  Neither impressed us.  Food was good enough, but price tags of our meals made it not worth it.  Based on those two places, I would say the prices at Forum Food Court is higher than normal.

On a positive note, there is plenty of available seating.  The staff does a fine job of keeping the dining area neat and welcoming."}
