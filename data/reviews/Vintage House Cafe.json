{"text":"Where to start... with the arrogant service or the mediocre, at best food? If you're looking for a ma and pa  slop house there's a dozen different restaurants you can go to in the Avon area for half the price, a fraction of the price, and decent service. Last place I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing staff. Amazing front of the house manager. Amazing chef. I would recommend this place to any anyone. Everyone is always so happy and friendly. The best soups you will ever taste. The vintage house is the best place for a date with there cute fireplace room. Best food in town. I will be back very soon!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch on the lovely patio at the Vintage House. The turkey croissant sandwich with cranberries was amazing - and the fruit plate that came with it was outstanding!  Add a couple glasses as white wine and it was a perfect lunch!  Oh ya - add the fries that accompanied my husbands also excellent sandwich and you have a real winner!! Will be back whenever I'm the Avon area."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, but I feel that it must be done in order for other reviews to have any meaning.  The staff is nice and the place is clean.

If your food tastes have not changed since 1950 and you like giant portions, this is the place for you.  Nothing jumps off the menu as sounding especially good and nothing we ordered tasted especially good.  Not terrible, just not good.  I'm guessing that it's a lot of frozen/pre-packaged items, but I could be wrong.  There are other options nearby, I would just skip this place."}
{"text":"This was quite a nice surprise. I drive past the Vintage House Cafe every day, but we had never eaten there. They put up a sign out front advertising brunch on Sundays from 10am-2pm, so we gave it a shot last Sunday.
Why hasn't anyone written a review about this place yet? It's wonderful. The interior is homey, yet chic-- makes you feel like you're somewhere in in the Old South, like Charleston.
For the price you pay ($11 each for the brunch buffet), you get your choice of about 5 hot dishes, a couple of cold dishes, and 4 pastries.. plus a customizable omelet and mimosa menu for an extra $2 or so.
Will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Really want to like this place but the couple times we have been here it just hasn't delivered. Food every time has been OK but nothing to write home about. Outdoor patio is really nice but the last time we sat out there the service was nonexistent to the point of being humorous (almost). A simple weeknight dinner (with one other table) took us over 2 hours to get through including 25 minutes after we were done eating to get our bill paid ( i finally went into the building to track our server down and hand her the cash). The patio is nice enough I might sit outside for drinks but I would skip the food. Maybe breakfast is better."}
{"text":"Straight from the freezer to your plate. For $30/person, you would expect better than chicken that came straight from a container. Service obviously did not want to be there. A smile would have been nice. First and last time our family will go there."}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day Brunch. What a disappointment!! The waitress was so unfriendly,never smiled. The food was run of the mill. Mostly frozen stuff that probably came from Costco. Raw bacon and sausage as well. Nothing chef made that's for sure!! Nobody will come back from our table ever!! So over priced for crap."}
{"text":"Spent a lovely evening here. Wonderful service, a beautiful patio, and very reasonably priced Italian cuisine. This place is a gem. Also, they have a wine dinner the last Thursday of every month: 5 courses and 5 wines plus dessert, for $30! incredible!"}
{"text":"I've recently been on the job hunt and saw the help wanted sign posted outside this cafe. After I decided to pop in to apply, I entered the restaurant. If I had been a real customer I would have been seriously unimpressed. I waited approximately 7 minutes with no one coming over where I stood next to the sign telling me to \"please wait to be seated\". After finally spotting someone who worked there I approached her inquiring about the sign. She tells me that it's the middle of dinner rush and not the best time but to wait and she would see if there was an application. Keep in mind the restaurant is barely occupied and it is only 5 o'clock in the evening. She informs the one other person that seems to be working there, that I am there about the job. She also rudely informs me \"for future reference you shouldn't stop to fill out an application during dinner rush\", and I apologized and said that I didn't realize it was a busy time for them. If the restaurant had been swamped I would have completely understood, but in this situation it was not the case. The other woman then enters the kitchen area where I can hear her say \"sorry won't get you the job\", which clearly I was not meant to be privy to. Finally she comes back to where I'm standing and proceeds to barely look through one messy drawer for an application. She declined to have one available for me, and once again told me in the future it would be best to come at another time. I was absolutely appalled with the way I was treated by these women. Not only will I not return to apply for the job, but I will also never eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Received a gift certificate to dine here and after living in Avon for over 5 yrs and never having been there, really wish we had sooner. It is so charming, the staff was great, and the food was delicious. I ordered the cedar plank salmon, and swapped out the lobster mash for garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. The chicken noodle soup made me feel like I was at home (like my childhood home where my mom did ALL of the cooking) and the cheesecake was, dare I say it again, BETTER  than the Cheesecake Factory. I also tasted my husband's order of onion rings (perfectly cooked and crispy), and my daughters spaghetti and huge meatball. ALL GOOD! After dinner, we browser the upstairs mini tea gift shop. Wanting to go again to try another dish."}
{"text":"I love this cafe!  We go here for lunch all the time, especially after shopping out in Avon.  The atmosphere is very quaint and relaxing.  

They have the BEST ice teas.  Love the appetizer dips.  The service is always great and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week. Vegetable quiche was small in size and delicious- just what I needed. The place is nice and quaint, and our server attentive."}
{"text":"Just had to update this, because it is summer and the patio is open! It is beautiful, and not crowded. Their fries are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food made from scratch and large portions!  Always comfortable, pleasant and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really hate leaving this review because I visited before and thought things were getting better. We ended up spending 70.00 on a meal we thought we could use a coupon for. And, it was totally not worth the money at all. We ended up feeling ill later on, and everything was overall just too greasy and lacking good flavors. Our server was nice but didnt seem to know what the heck was going on. Wish we would have bought 4 days worth of groceries for the price of one junky meal at the Vintage House. Big bummer!"}
{"text":"No longer the vintage house. Anxious to try the new iteration, as we need restaurants in Avon. Tried dinner before an Avon football game. Apps were good. Waitress was fair. Brussels sprouts were good. Food orders were so so. My wife ordered her salad with chicken. Salad was good, but no chicken, as she had ordered. I ordered the meatball small plate as my meal. 3 golf ball size meatballs for $16. Wow. While the cute skillet was hot, the meatballs were not. At $5+ each, they did NOT make the grade. I ate a half of one. Ick. Two of the guests had the salmon and both enjoyed very much. The separation between the two is what is really scary. The waitress was not familiar with wine. It's in the name. I hope they get it together, as we DO need places to eat in Avon   Good luck as I think it will be uphill for you."}
{"text":"I called twice to check that a groupon was valid.  I was told that it was still valid.When I walked in, I immediately explained that I was troubled that I had already used the groupon.  Three times, I was assurred that it was valid.  When the bill comes, the manager arrives and says it had been used.  Groupon had sent reminders that I should use it soon or it would expire.  I was livid and the manager was OBNOXIUS.  If the restaurant offers groupons to get you in the door to \"experience\" the restaurant.  I had an experience and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"We were greeted and waited on right away, the atmosphere was nice, however when my friend was served her chicken breast, it was dry and tough and looked like it came right out of the freezer. We waited for the waitress to come over and check on us and after 20 minutes, I had to go find her. She did bring another chicken breast which was cooked fine, but by that time I was finished eating and my friend had to eat alone. Then, when we got up to leave, not a \"thank you\" \"Come back soon\" or \"have a nice day\". Nothing. Sadly, won't be going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio with my mom and it was a lovely day!!! Great to be home from columbus for a bit and this was the perfect place to chill. 

Our waitress was amazing. She was peppy and informative. She did not seem to mind our slow, chill pace we were going at and actually encouraged it. We had a mishap on my mayo and she was quick to fix it.... even put a nice spin on it by telling.me how excited she was that I did get to try the sandwich without it because it is amazing with the mayo.... and OMG it was a life changer! Completely melded the flavors together. I don't know if I would have appreciated it if I wouldn't have had the opportunity to try it plain first.

They make a great homemade iced tea..... I wanted to bring some home with me..... but we had already ordered an extra sandwich to go so I figured it was a bit much...... : ) 

I hope she gets a great pat on the back. I wish I could remember her name but she said she had been there for awhile and knew some family friends of ours actually. Darker hair and a lovely smile!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  My kids love this place.  The food is good and I don't understand the negative reviews.  The soups are goods, the sandwiches are great.  My daughters usually get a cup of soup and share a sandwich.  They offer meatball subs, various wraps and different salads.  

The staff has always been helpful and attentive.  

We have never gone to the Sunday brunch but I have friends who have and said that it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast of the millenium......went local and instead got frozen/institutional food/quality - ugh.  Most of the food actually had that fake \"frozen yet cooked via microwave\" look to it on the Sunday buffet.  We paid and left without eating.......clearly the staff that works there has no idea what they are missing out on either which was a joke. Could have been so beautiful, so right, yet so wrong...."}
{"text":"I can't recommend you going there.  The server was nice and seemed happy, but service was pretty poor.  Got our order wrong and then we had to wait while one dinner was corrected.  Forgot to give us butter with the bread, etc..  Food really wasn't warm when served and it didn't taste very good.  Had to ask for everything or you didn't get it.  For the prices charged here, you can do much better trying somewhere else.  The amount of food included doesn't measure up to prices charged."}
{"text":"I am so confused by the low rating!!! This restaurant is charming!  We went for brunch last weekend and it was wonderful!  The staff were very attentive and the food was delicious!! We sat on the patio and it was lovely.  Disregard the past ratings from others.  You will enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lobster ravioli. The ravioli was barely warm, rather than hot. Conversely, the langostinos were overcooked and quite rubbery. I did like the sauce - it was quite tasty. And the Ho Ho chocolate cake was quite delicious. Service was uneven as the server spent a lot of time chatting with someone in the back. Overall, I will not go again."}
{"text":"Have given this place 3 chances and we're done.  Food is institutional.   Ordered lemon chicken which was served in a plate of water as if no one drained the noodles.
The lemon sauce was tasteless.  Definitely not home made.  Really a great location but very disappointing."}
