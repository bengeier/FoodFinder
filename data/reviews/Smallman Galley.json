{"text":"Such a cool concept! My group had delicious food from all pop-up restaurants and great happy hour specials at the bar. I had the most delicious dessert I've ever had from Carota Cafe- a Maple Pot de Creme with sea salt caramel, fresh whipped cream, and oatmeal chocolate chip cookie crumble...amazing!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is especially great if you go with a group with a variety of food interests.  Everyone can be happy at one time!"}
{"text":"Extensive selection but portions are small.

Bring your own silverware because you'll never find a knife, if you're lucky you'll get a fork. I had to eat my pork tenderloin with 2 forks."}
{"text":"Awesome place featuring 4 local startup restaurants that change out twice a year. Menus feature a variety of options with something for everyone's liking."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! I love the concept and love being able to have a completely different type of meal each time I visit. All the meals have great food profiles and aren't things I could find at other restaurants. Smallman has figured out how to make ordering food, ordering a drink and finding a table (each a different step) relatively easy! There are always plenty of people walking around helping to clear your table and fill your water!"}
{"text":"Have been several times.  Loved everything, every time.  Great casual atmosphere.  Very friendly service.  Great place to have a sit down meal in the strip"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype of this place. I found the ambiance like a Fire Department Hall and the food barely above average. I have no need to return here."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley. It's not just the food and beer (which are amazing) but it's about the experience. 

The owner runs the tap house which is located on the side wall of the Galley. There are 4 mini \"restaurants\" behind the bar and you can order and eat wherever. The purpose is to give these new restaurants a place to try their food and learn how to run a restaurant. Upon their success, the owner helps them (training/support) open their own restaurant. 

We got food at Provision (burger & provision fries were simply amazing) and sat at the bar to eat (Helltown HopFrenzy & BrewGents Blonde Ale) and drink. Wow. Just simply wow."}
{"text":"When looking for this place the signs are very hard to see. The bar was dialed in and will make just about any craft cocktail as a good hipster bar should. The foodA wow wow wow. So many choices. Check it out. The decor is just perfect for this sort of set up. They do have lights on full blast at night which is a shame because it could be a great place to chill otherwise. Closes real early."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, always sharing plates with different people, and I have never had a bad dish.  The concept is interesting, reminiscent of Krog Street Market in Atlanta, on a smaller scale.  I most recently had the sweat and sour pork Banh Mi from Provision--yum!!  Though Provision changed up the traditional sandwich, I was not upset for the change.  It came with a generous salad.  I also have loved the squash grilled cheese from Provision's neighbor-also delicious.  People have loved the avocado toast.  Great place."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley - it is all it is hyped up to be and more! The space itself is very open and there is plenty of space to sit with a large group or just the two of you. The food is delicious, my friend and I got dishes from Provision and Aubergine! We ordered the roasted squash (which was more a salad with the squash delicately spread on the plate with the salad and fixings on top) and the roasted olives from Provision, as well as the sundae for dessert (a perfect salty-sweet combination). And we got the fresh pasta and then chicken and dumplings dishes from Aubergine. The bar had wonderful selections for beer on tap, wine and creative cocktails. All in all, the wait was not long either. I love the concept of ordering and waiting to receive a text when your food was ready as well as being able to sit where ever you chose. So happy this 4 restaurant space opened up in the Strip District! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of large communal tables. The food at each station I tried was fantastic. I have had the pizza and a pork pho. The ingredients are thoughtful and each dish was skillfully crafted. The bar features PA beers with a great selection. Definitely recommend for any foodies or beer fans."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in the city. Kat the bartender is the shiiiiiiiit. Also get the Provision fries. I love their stupid cocktail menu themes and great cocktails. And beer selection."}
{"text":"Was so excited when this place opened up, great concept and food! Slightly on the pricier side but well worth it. My only complaint would be for the chefs to use local products such as spices & salts from Steel City Salt or fish from Penn Ave Fish Market and produce from Market Outlet which are all right around the corner...more local ingredients supporting the local vendors and shops."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago and loved it! Great concept, lots of variety to please everyone and delicious food! Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"If you don't have a good meal here it's probably your fault.  We've now been to SG 4 or 5 (or 6) times, and it's been excellent every time.  Each of the \"restaurants\" has a different approach, and so it's a great place to take visitors with different interests (which we've done, and everyone loved it).  We bounce around, and try dishes from each concept.

Not all of the kiosks are the same in terms of service (or pleasantness), but we have yet to have a meal that we didn't really enjoy.  Inventive, well seasoned, broadly diverse, always something you're going to be in the mood for.  It really is a great concept, and it just works.  And the bar has a great selection of beers.

We also really like the atmosphere.  As others have said, industrial, chill, bustling, but never beyond capacity.  You can hang as long or as short as you like.  

So why 5-stars?  I normally reserve 5-star ratings for places that do something truly innovative.    I wouldn't say that I've had \"mind-blowing food\" here.  (Not like Yasu in Toronto for example)  But we were there last week, and we both thought, \"Wow, we really like living here.\" Hard to find a better compliment than a place that makes you love where you live."}
{"text":"Had the best yogurt/fruit/granola bowl of my life for brunch one weekend. That doesn't sound very exciting, and honestly I wasn't expecting much, but WOW."}
{"text":"Nice food. Idiotic concept. You feel like you're walking around inside a website. Confusing. Line up and spend 6 dollars here, do it all again 3 feet away, have your privacy invaded and your data mined, get 4 texts and two robot calls, all to gather up your own lunch and sit at a picnic table. Guess what, Google-eyed hipsters, there are chefs out there who will wow you and treat you like a guest in their homes. Support them! Love innovation, but the Burgh is all about keeping it real, and this place is the polar opposite."}
{"text":"Such a unique and amazing concept.  Don't always love my food, but always enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Brew year's eve was a disappointment.  We spent $90 and got total 3 beers. Disorganization made access to the beer essentially impossible.  Needed crowd control and muliple stations set up.  No light snacks provided and restaurants stopped cooking at 10 pm on New Year's Eve.  They knew how many tickets were sold, but didn't have a way to provide everyone with expected samples of beer. 
Will try the food at a less crazy time."}
{"text":"I've owed this review to Smallman for some time, but finally taking the time to do it. 

I've been to Smallman a number of times for breakfast, dinner,  or just drinks and Smallman always has something to offer.

The care that's been put into this place is evident as the owners walk the floor almost constantly and they've put in significant effort to find top tier bartenders and 4 different cooks!  I'm pretty sure I've seen one of the bartenders tending at Acacia before too.

If I lived in the Strip district this would definitely be a go to for any meal, or just a great hangout for great beer and great cocktails.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time over the weekend after dying to check it out for months and overall had a really great experience. I love the concept - you're free to wander around, grab a drink, order in stages, move tables, etc. The space is gorgeous and everybody we spoke to was super knowledgeable about the food or drink they were preparing, which was awesome. The place was the perfect amount of busy (Friday before a long weekend probably meant it was a little emptier than normal) and all of our food was ready ~10 minutes after we ordered it.

There were four of us and without planning we all ordered something different - more to try! Tip: Definitely check out the menus online before you go - some of the chalkboards were hard to read, and seeing all of the delicious-sounding options was almost overwhelming.

Smothered Fries - Provision PGH - At first I skeptical because the ingredients sounded really weird together: lentils? peas? goat cheese? Um ok....except together it was all AMAZING. These were the most perfect, crispy fries I have ever eaten, and the toppings all magically worked. I wouldn't necessarily order these for myself, but they're perfect to share.

Pork Belly, Shrimp+Grits, Pickles - Aubergine Bistro - There was a fried softshell crab special that looked amazing but it was sold out by the time we went to order. Boo. The pork belly was beyond succulent and flavorful. The shrimp and grits were OK (the grits definitely carried the dish), but the presentation was kind of underwhelming since they were just slopped into this tiny bowl with no garnish. The pickles were a tad too salty for me but they were a nice contract to the rest of the heavier dishes.

Octopus, Horseradish Gnocchi - Carota Cafe - Far and away my favorite. The octopus was tender and charred perfectly, and even swayed the seafood hater at our table! The potatoes and chimichurri were a little over-salted, but it didn't detract overall from the dish (more of a personal preference). I wish the gnocchi had been even heavier on the horseradish, but again, another personal preference. And the presentation blew everybody else out of the water - I wish I could have captured it in photos, but there were edible flowers!

At this point we were stuffed but realized we hadn't ordered anything from Josephine's Toast. TBH most of the dishes there seemed kind of underwhelming, but her dessert menu seemed on point so we gave the strawberry-rhubarb \"cake toast\" a shot. My expectations were low (I'm not usually a sweets person) but this was the perfect way to end the dinner - light, not too sugary, and perfect to share.


The only drawbacks from our experience and the reason I'm not giving 5 stars:
1. The drinks are REALLY expensive for what they are. I get that they're using local liquor and top-shelf brands, but $10-12 a cocktail (or glass of wine) adds up quickly. The bartender did mention they have a good happy hour special, unfortunately I'm never around the area during that time.

2. While the space doesn't have traditional servers, they did have two busboys on duty and honestly could have used at least one more. Tables nearby were left piled with dirty dishes throughout our entire meal, and we also had trouble flagging somebody down to refill our water bottle (we stole another from a nearby table but that didn't seem like a reasonable solution). Stuff happens and for all I know maybe they were short-staffed that night, but this was the one aspect of the night that left me kind of going \"hmmmm.\" Reading other reviews it seems like it's an ongoing problem - it was relatively slow the night we were there, so I can't imagine what it must be like when it's busy.

Overall a really fun and interesting night out, and remarkably relaxing considering it was a lot of restaurant DIY. There were dishes at each place I can't wait to go back and try....not to mention brunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, unique opportunity to try three different food fare options in the same spot. 

A draft list comprised entirely of local breweries topped off great pizza."}
{"text":"This is one of the most fun and interesting restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The chefs each take such pride in their menus and the staff works hard to make sure everyone gets food quickly and understands the concept.  We walked in and took a seat at the long table near the bar, where the incredibly friendly and kind general manager, Geoff, came over at  our invitation to talk about the concept.  Chefs were brought in from all over the country to compete for the opportunity to open a first restaurant in this space with full support of the creators/owners (former military) - a true food incubator in the ever-growing Pittsburgh tech scene!  The chefs stay for 18 months and then have the opportunity to move on to their own businesses. This format means that every single thing they do is great because each chef is so invested in putting his or her best food forward.  After we had a few drinks and some amazing local beers, we switched tables to one of the many in the back, where amazing art hung on the walls.  We walked up to the counters and placed our orders, were given a number for our table, and our food arrived. We ordered from each of the four restaurants and loved everything!  We plan to go back before the chefs change later this year - there are just so many great choices in this lively and fun spot!!  Thank you!!!  Awesome idea!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great happy hour. God forbid you order drinks five minutes before 7 and the bartender rings you out at 7:01. Not a good way to get people to come back."}
{"text":"Perfect setup for someone who's indecisive and greedy when it comes to food (like myself). To be able to pick and choose from four different menus, how great is that?? The wide array of food options and casual communal seating also makes it perfect for group gatherings. Tasty cocktails are half off during happy hour (5-7pm Mon-Fri). All in all, very good value for your money.

Favorite dishes:
Aubergine - Pork belly and tomatoes (or the entree), Risotto Nero, Shrimp and grits
Carota Cafe - Octopus
Provision Pgh - Duck, pork and bacon terrine 
(Have not tried Josephine's Toast but have heard good things)"}
{"text":"Love it!  The concept is fantastic, the space is funky and historic, and there's something for everyone.  The bar side is a little more upbeat, the dining side is better suited for families and quieter.

Only negative is it's tough to move around the space, the walking area is narrow and shared by people walking around, staff, people waiting in line, etc."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in town. There are so many choices and different styles of food that you can choose from. I highly recommend getting the hand made pasta. I love that it is a non-profit organization."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. Drinks at the bar, pizza at iron born and coffee at Common Place. You must check it out. In my opinion, not a good spot for kids under 10."}
{"text":"The fresh pasta from aubergine was the business. So was the creamed kale. So so tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is super unique. I love how you can choose between 4 different restaurants. I tried a few of the restaurants and I thought the food was good, but not fantastic. It's hard to completely judge the food since there are so many options, so I would say give it a shot. It's a really cool experience that I think anyone would enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic..

It is designed as a \"restaurant incubator,\" meaning that multiple start up restaurants take up space here for a year, prepare their food for customers, and learn more about developing a businesses model around their product.

The seating is community style to encourage social interaction and there is a bar for customers to get cocktails and craft beer.

The space is great for a casual, quality meal and a very neat concept.  The owner is really onto something here and can usually be spotted walking about and checking in on people's experience.  One of my favorite spots in the city."}
{"text":"Iron Born pizza has to be one of the best pizzas I've ever had. My boyfriend and I shared the \"Spicy\" pizza. It had pepperoni, banana peppers, red sauce, and some other bits I can't remember. By far the winning ingredient was the honey. The pizza was perfect. It was also perfectly cooked. Sure, $16 is pretty pricy for a 6 piece deep dish but we will definitely be returning. 

Oh, we also tried the Jasmine Tea from Banhmilicious and it was also perfect. Over $4, so it was a little pricy but again, very worth it."}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh recently and had a chance to stop at smallman galley. The gf is really fond of this place so we stopped in for lunch. All 4 restaurants seemed to have incredible food. As pizza fiends, Ironborn was the obvious choice. We shared a pepperoni pizza and got extra marinara on the side. The crust was fried and crispy. It was covered in melted cheese and topped with crunchy pepperoni. That was it. We ate it. And it was good. #noregrets"}
{"text":"Love the concept!  Great atmosphere and good selection of craft beer but the food was served ICE COLD!  Our restaurant choice was Josephine's Toast."}
{"text":"Review of Colonia. 4* with lots of potential! Best Hispanic food I've gotten in Pittsburgh hands-down. 

My wife and I just checked out the new concepts at Smallman and decided to go with Colonia for some intriguing Latin American dishes. We started with pao de queso (crisped but tender cheese bread rolls) and a chicken papusa (stuffed masa cake) and had the casamiento (rice and black bean and vegetables) 'divorce' bowl for our entree. 

The pao was delicious, crispy and savory on the outside, and revealing a moist and chewy innard that housed the accompanying spread nicely. Don't let the $8 price tag deter you because they are hard to make right and are absolutely delicious. 

Papusa was not my favorite because the thickness of masa needed to hold the stuffing in was a bit much (prefer tamale thickness I guess?) but the flavors were spot on perfect and the pickled cabbage and carrots paired well. The leftovers of this were actually better than the day of because I think the moisture of the fresh masa had some time to leech out making the thickest bits less chewy. 

Our entree was a good choice. It's vegetarian (incidental not lifestyle) but very satisfying. The 'divorce' version added more jalapeño and spice which was done well. All in all the rice, beans, corn, jicama, etc all were cooked and seasoned very well. I think a corn tostada added as a side would complete the experience give a little more texture to the dish, but again it was a satisfying and delicious meal. It's a lot of food so don't be afraid to split this! 

After a good first round, we look forward to trying the excellent meat options next visit (amber jack, flank steak we're looking at you!)."}
{"text":"Great when you are looking for a variety. We did the Brazilian cheese bread (bread was amazing), one red top pizza, and steak Vietnamese noodles. All were great. Would absolutely go back again. So much to choose from."}
{"text":"Stopped in Pittsburgh on our way to New York City for spring break with the family.  Very cool concept where you can choose four different chefs to choose from as you order at the counter.  Then pick your seat and enjoy.  Great experience and good!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food from all the stations. Happy hour is decent .The bar has a good selection of beer, cocktails, and wine. The reuse of an old industrial space in the strip district is also a bonus ."}
{"text":"Ate there today for lunch - what a great atmosphere and unique concept for a restaurant!  The food was fresh, creative and delicious and the beer selection was great.  Each of the four restaurants (chefs) are there for 18 months, after which time, they will move on to (hopefully) open their own place and four new chefs will replace them. We ordered dishes from three of the four restaurants, sat at the long table in the bar area and received a text when each dish was ready.  All of the beer served is brewed and bottled in Pittsburgh (except for Straub and Yuengling).  They even have an espresso bar where we picked up some lattes to go.  I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!!  A great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene."}
{"text":"Four different restaurants to choose from and an awesome bar sounds good in my book. If you can't find something that you like to eat/drink in this place, then I don't know what to tell you. I like trying something from all four restaurants and sharing with the rest of my party. This place gets busy, especially for happy hour! They have an awesome beer and cocktail selection. In addition, they also serve brunch! I could come here weekly and still not have tried everything! It's a great place to bring out of towners."}
{"text":"Really loved all the food we got here, its a fun alternative to usual dining. The only thing to be ready for is that if your group orders from multiple places, the food may come out at different times. It is a place you have to be flexible but its worth it!"}
{"text":"I got there and was a bit confused on where to order at first, but then quickly got the jist of it. I ordered the porridge from toast and it tasted really good with lots of flavor. At toast there was a sample plate that had a piece of toast with bacon flavored butter on it which was delicous!"}
{"text":"This place is just the best idea. It's great for large groups because there is something for every palette, from burgers to Banh Mi. I love the number of seasonal vegetable options as well as the opportunity to try a variety of desserts from different chefs.

Be warned: this place is popular. It can be hard to find a seat during the popular dinner rush.  However, it's worth enduring a little chaos to try a variety of good food."}
{"text":"We came in here on suggestion from our uber. Pretty much they have four chefs and each specialize in a different types of food and it seems like the menus are self made! Each one has their own style to making their food and it's probably the coolest place I've been to to be honest! I've never seen a place quite like this and it's awesome! The food is bomb and you can't really go wrong with anything here! Me and my friend ordered from different menus and it's lit!!!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and the food does not disappoint. I tried Provision and Carota Cafe. Both had great food, but my favorite thing that I tried was the gnocchi from Carota Cafe. I'm still thinking about it! I plan on going back for some more gnocchi before they change restaurants, but I'm looking forward to see what places move into the space."}
{"text":"I want to know what unicorn cocaine seasoning Carota's chicken hash is made of? I may never want to try a different dish. The frittata was pretty good too, not the best I've ever had but still great! 

Provision's duck egg omelette took forever. Not okay. If you're always busy, it would
make sense to be better prepared for a Sunday brunch. It tasted great but it's misleadingly small. Have to take a star off for that. The galley is awesome so I can't take two stars off."}
{"text":"Loved this place, cool concept, great food, fantastic cocktails. Went here with my girlfriends, we have a dinner club that meets monthly. Wanted to try something newer, so we picked this place. 

First let's start with the drinks, the happy hour specials were 1/2 off all drinks...ALL DRINKS! I had a cocktail that was a beet infused vodka. I personally loved it, but you have to really be a fan of beets. 

We all ordered food from different places and were sharing it. The burger from the meat place was delectable, the fries were also great, we shared toast with homemade cottage cheese and pineapples which was delicious, then had an apple upside down cake for dessert. 

Overall it was a great experience, a fun environment and an awesome addition to the Burgh."}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty, tasty! 

I love the concept of four restaurants in one. Was a little confused at first but went to the furthest restaurant and got a plain burger but there wasn't much that was plain about it. Fresh meat with fresh ingredients. Done to perfect temperature! The fries also were tasty. Very crisp and hot. Fresh out! 

Got a variety of craft beers, a nice selection and the water on the table was convient. 

Now for dessert, I got the seeded dark chocolate cookie. A different taste. The seeds were sunflower. I liked but not typically my style of cookie.

All in all, awesome experience."}
{"text":"I love places like this! Hip and cool! 4 different kitchens, different  flavors! Everyone can find something to their liking! Definitely come with friends! Or make new one's! And they serve delicious coffee! And drinks if I'm not mistaken!"}
{"text":"I was unfortunately disappointed by my experience at Smallman Galley. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea and enjoyed my food but my overall experience detracted from enjoying those things. The atmosphere was very overwhelming which made it unenjoyable and rather stressful - I would be interested to see if the experience on a weeknight would be different but nonetheless it detracted from my experience on Saturday night. There wasn't any clear direction on how everything worked other than watching other people and we awkwardly took our dishes up to the bussing station because no one had come by to clear the table. I think that the concept of the restaurant is great and I love the idea, but the execution was disappointing for me. In terms of the food, we had the Iron Born red pizza which was good but not life-changing. The quality of the food and speed at which it was brought out was great. Now that I've been there, I would like to try some of the other stalls but I won't be rushing to return soon."}
{"text":"First time at this place today and I was very impressed. I chose to eat from Josephine's Toast and the food was really good - I had the avocado toast with flax seeds, added bacon and a side salad. Jacqueline, the owner, went above and beyond today. I asked her if she had any shirts for sale because my daughter's name is Josephine and I thought it'd be kinda cool to get her one. Although she didn't have any for sale, while we were eating our food, Jacqueline came back over and dropped a small-sized shirt on the table, just as a gift, no payment expected. Really cool. The atmosphere was swanky casual but very laid back and people were very helpful (I didn't know if I needed to clean up after we ate or if that was done for us - the two busboys happily did it for us.) The bar area was nice but I'll have to come back for that - just got a chai tea latte to go. The barista was nice and she gave us a little almond cookie for free to go with our drink. Awesome."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the Strip District! I've gone here multiple times now for brunch, dinner and just drinks and always have been impressed. I've tried food from all four of the kitchens, and can honestly say I'd go back to any of them. Some favorites have been the roasted beets at Provision, the octopus at Carota, the corned beef sandwich from Aubergine and of course the avocado toast from Josephine's. The menus seem to frequently change or have specials, and that's one of the great things about this place. I plan to keep going back and won't get tired of the options! 

While all of the food choices are good, the bar might even be better. They have a changing menu of local beers on tap and the cocktails are delicious. And if you get there for happy hour pricing you can't ask for much more! There's also an espresso bar area if you aren't in the mood for alcoholic beverages. 

The only negative I have is that when the bar area gets crowded it's not the most convenient for this type of setup where you have to order your own drinks every time and there are not servers, but overall the pros of SG outweigh the cons by a lot. Check it out if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"Lots of space and many great food options. It was quiet at lunchtime and nice to sit by the window and look out at the Design museum. I'd like to go back and try the cocktails with dinner."}
{"text":"Fresh, often local, ingredients with inventive, ever-changing menus. There are basically 4 different concepts/restaurants under the roof of Smallman Galley. We went to three of them. Apparently the \"concepts\" shift every 18 months. 

Rapini Grilled Cheese ($13) - Carota Cafe - the sandwich was packed with good cheddar cheese and topped with charred broccoli rabe and on the side was a fresh green salad. 

Fettuccine pasta - Aubergine Bistro - the pasta itself was good. The dish had a light spring flavor with bright green peas and sugar snap peas in a thin buttery sauce. Overall, it was very good. 

Egg salad - accompanied by a large-leaf lettuce salad and usually bread which my mom didn't order. The salad was too creamy for me but it was seasoned well and the egg whites were silky - perfect. 

Smashed Avocado toast with toasted flaxseed - my mom got this with gluten free toast. The toast was a dense, chewy GF bread. The smashed avocado was good.

Overall, a unique, delicious experience. There are so many more items I'd love to try. Nothing knocked my socks off but everything was very good. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"A really nice concept that should be tried everywhere.  I had the detroit style pizza and some chicken and dumplings from the latin food station.  The pizza was just about as good as the detroit pizza from my favorite spot in Houston.  Mostly just the atmosphere and selection this place offers make it a must-try in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great concept! Very very nice food. For ppl who have not been here. The place is like a food court with rustic atmosphere. Food options are more on a modern side, with plenty of options to choose from.

Price is 12-22$ for an entree, drinks are 5$ beer and $12-15 for cocktails."}
{"text":"Love the concept! Have only tried the aubergine. I got the ricotta tart. My friends got pork belly and trout. They are pretty good, especially the pork belly."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, brunch, dinner...all the meals. This is such a cool spot. Love the vibe of communal seating and picking which section to order food from. I've been here a handful of times and love the food more each time! I think the prices are worth it, and since there are a lot of choices it lets you control how much you want to spend. Not that money should be a factor when you get amazing food and get to enjoy it in a dope setting."}
{"text":"Wow the hidden gem of the Strip District. So many delicious options. With innovative chefs and a trendy atmosphere it has a San Francisco feel. We tried a white pizza and Vietnamese rolls both fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Constantly changing menu and a great draft list.  Always a great spot to take friends visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Finally, after what seemed like ages of missed opportunities, my wife and I were able to stop here for a late lunch/early dinner... Or simply put, an off time on a Saturday. And thankfully we did.

What better way to settle the argument about where to eat than to pick a spot with four different restaurants. And it goes without saying that we each chose a different spot, as I went with Provision.

Off the bat, I wasn't overly pleased at being he only one at their counter and not even acknowledged for about 5 minutes as they were all working on some burgers and fries. I decided to order the Banh Mi sandwich and an order of rice pudding. As expected I gave them my number and went to sit at the bar with my wife.

She had already ordered and within 5 minutes her food was served up as she had octopus (I missed the name of the \"restaurant\"). We both glanced around as we didn't have any silverware and nobody was really telling us what to do. Little did we know you grabbed them yourself near where you order the food.

The downside here is that she was finished eating before my food was ready. After receiving two missed calls from a number I didn't recognized I looked down and saw my food was sitting there waiting. So much for the text message as that didn't happen for either of us?

I went down to pick up my food and once again, no acknowledgement. The Banh mi sandwich was good, but all it really made me do is wish I was up the street at Lucy's. The pork was good, a little overly crispy, and the pickled vegetables didn't have much acidity. It also needed some heat but jalapeños were absent. I did really enjoy their fries - but once again, no ketchup and no real help from anyone.

The rice pudding though? Absolutely out of this world good, and I was glad I didn't pass up ordering it.

I adore this concept, and will certainly be back... However they seem to have some things still not figured out. I can only imagine how crazy it could get in here during brunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Smallman Galley. The concept is great and there is great variety at the different stations. Loved trying something from each place and splitting a hodge podge meal with friends! The bar is also great with a variety of cocktails and beer on tap."}
{"text":"This place rocks, very unique as for Pittsburgh standards, has multiple restaurants in one place serving different varieties of food from Detroit style pizza to Baht Mi sandwiches. All the food I have had was very good and has a great atmosphere for either lunch or dinner. It is located right in the Strip District, which makes it great for Saturday Brunch and a little shopping."}
{"text":"I love the concept and the food was very good and different. Their Happy Hour is half off Drinks! and drinks always go great with good food"}
{"text":"Love Smallman Galley. Have been there twice since I moved to the neighborhood. Recently found out I have celiac and was able to find something there with no issue to eat. I ate at Provisions and ordered a burger with no bun. They were very accommodating with my dietary restrictions. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE PLACE IN THE BURGH!!! Never disappointed! Perfect Sunday brunch spot!!! Service is awesome! You can tell there's a ton of passion put into every dish!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Best eatery in Pittsburgh.  Just had brunch there and it blew away any breakfast I've had in the Burgh.  I cannot get enough of this place and I love supporting the design."}
{"text":"Visited a friend in Pittsburgh this past weekend, and we were looking for lunch between house hunting and going to the Mattress Factory. After browsing Yelp a bit, we decided to just browse the Strip.

It was cold, windy and rainy, and we saw a spot in front of Smallman. Initially, I wasn't jazzed about the idea of a cafeteria-style lunch. But the menus looked good, and we discovered there was a full bar in the back.

Upon closer inspection and checking out what other people ordered, the four restaurants had a great variety of price ranges and dishes. My friend ordered the avocado toast with an egg from Josephine's Toast. I ordered the pasta with peas, pesto and parm. Both ended up being flavorful and well-seasoned, and I loved that the pasta was homemade and was showered with lots of microplaned parm. We grabbed seats at the bar to wait for the text (a pretty cool idea) saying our food was ready.

One thing I didn't love was the difference in timing of our dishes. She got her avo toast about 15 minutes before my pasta, so we ended up eating at different times. I'd recommend ordering an appetizer to share first, so one of you isn't staring longingly at the other's meal.

We ordered cocktails--their theme right now is baseball, and the list is called the \"Starting Lineup.\" She had a gin drink with egg white that was well-balanced and garnished beautifully, and I has a rum cocktail with passion fruit.

The second drinks we got, however, stole the show. I ordered the Raise the Jolly Lager, with cracker jack rum, salted lime cordial, lager, and probably something else in it, garnished with a pirate flag. When we ordered that drink, one of the bartenders said, \"Fuck yeah!\" Apparently most people overlook it, but they love making it. (And apparently, this order gave us some street cred, because they gave us samples of Bols Genever and the cracker jack rum.) Can't say enough about how delicious this cocktail was! I'd like five more, please. We'd seen one of the bartenders with luxardo cherries, and my friend asked for a drink with one. She explained she liked St. Germaine, etc., and he came up with a drink that had lemon juice, Bols Genever, St. Germaine, orange bitters and a luxardo cherry. Killer.

We'd planned to go to the Mattress Factory and the Warhol Museum that afternoon. After one cocktail, friend asked if it was OK if we just went to one. After two, we decided to scrap the whole plan--this place was that good. This would do really well in Baltimore--please open one here! Or at least send cracker jack rum."}
{"text":"Great way to enjoy the end of a beautiful day walking and examining the strip district....the white pizza at iron born was a welcome change from Chicago pizza (which is born in me) and an awesome bahn mi with ancient meat at bahnmilicious...it's a great space"}
{"text":"I would give this 3 1/2 stars. I read the reviews and was a little disappointed. I guess the concept of having many different options under one roof is great but I believe you need to nail in order to have this concept work. The place is cute and deco is cool for sure. We went with a large group so the long tables are hard to have conversations. Everyone had something different. The pizza was probably the best out of all the orders. The bowls were okay but nothing exciting. I think a little overrated honestly."}
{"text":"A neat concept for a restaurant incubator.  Pittsburgh doesn't have many places like this and it's a cool place to go for dinner or drinks if you're in the neighborhood.  I went here with a group of five on a Thursday night around 7:30 and it wasn't too packed with a decent amount of seating still available for our group.

This time I went to Aubergine for the Chicken and Dumplings.  It was simple, and I don't mean that as a bad thing.  Simple can be good, especially for something like chicken and dumplings when what you want is something wholesome to warm you up from a rain, cold evening.  I'll be doing this again the next time i'm at Smallman Galley and it's on the menu.

Other times I've been there and gotten the toast cake (from Josephine's Toast) and the Provision fries (from Provision PGH).   The toast cake, is an interesting idea, but not pulled off all the time.  Some of the cake had the right texture, but there were other parts that tasted more like stale bread than cake (or toast).  The Provision fires were great, and a delicious flavor profile.  They go great with many of the beers they had at the bar.

Finally, the concept of getting a text message when your food is ready has some problems.  It's great because it reduces the need for waitstaff to deliver food when it's cooked.  On the other hand, by the time I get there my phone is dead or there's been a miscommunication about what my number is and I never get the text.  It defeats the point of not having waitstaff if they cooks still have to walk around the tables shouting your name to deliver your food.

Still, I'll be going back and taking visitors as well when they come into town.  If people want to talk bad about Pittsburgh's restaurant game, I'll be offering this as a counter."}
{"text":"First visit to Smallman Galley and love the concept. Easy to order and community seating with bottled water ready at each table made lunch time no nonsense for a weekday.  My open faced tuna at Josephine's Toast was delicious!  Expected some form of sandwich and pleasantly surprised with grilled bread topped with flavorful tuna salad. Tuna was lightly tossed with oil, arugula, thinly sliced radishes and olives. It was a visual as well as savory pleasure.  Looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"SUCH a cool idea!! I can't believe it took me so long to get here! Happy hour was a great idea and easy to meet lots of friends! We had about 8 of us there for my birthday. It was so simple to have everyone order what they wanted and pay separately. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A new, innovative eating concept that is similar to a glorified food court.  The food is brought to your table after you order at the counter(s).  

I went with a group of 7 people.  Orders from each of the 4 restaurants were placed.  In general, this is an Interesting place to try, but the 4 restaurants still need some work before standing on their own.  

The pizza was salty and lukewarm, the Latin American food was bland, the burger while tasty wasn't offered with ketchup for the teen in the group, and the Vietnamese noodle bowl was ok, but could have been more flavorful and had more chicken."}
{"text":"Well-embraced idea of \"restaurant incubator\" and trend setting in Pittsburgh! An exciting and intimate environment to hang out with your friends and loved ones plus the total freedom to try all of the 4 restaurants!! I was originally worried about the food being too \"cafeteria standard\" but to my amazement, the food was GOOD and entirely high end restaurant level. Also loved the rustic decor and fresh, well made cocktails (I personally hate artificially flavored cocktails)! Definitely worth going back :D"}
{"text":"The idea is intriguing but not sure if one could afford to keep paying $$ for mediocre \"de-constructed\" chicken pot pie;  which by definition is supposed to be comfort food and therefore, no-frills and tasty. No, thank you to the deconstruction, I'll stick to my classic chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"My kimchi egg salad was delicious. Nicely flavored with some carrot crunches. Comes with some greens too."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with coworkers, great spot for a happy hour and delicious bite. It's great that your group can trickle in at their convenience, order food from the multiple options available, and enjoy the fun ambiance once they arrive. So far I've tried food from three of the venues available. They deep dish pepperoni pizza is awesome, and this is coming from a true New Yorker. The shrimp and grits, upscale spin on comfort food, was delicious. And the Vietnamese noodle bowel was excellent. Highly recommend this spot for both convenience and great food!"}
{"text":"Came here after the tour guide at Wigle Whiskey recommended it to the group.  I love the concept of this place.  It was hard to choose, but we both ended up eating at Provision.  I ordered the short rib pho and my husband got the \"burger of the moment\", a bacon/blue cheese burger.  Both were very very good.  The draft selection at the bar was varied and offered a lot of local beers.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried Smallman Galley for the first time for brunch on a Sunday.  It was around 11:45/12 and it was still really busy - we luckily found a table and saved our seats.  I think this place is a really cool concept.  There are 4 different pop up style restaurants in one long open space and you can check out each limited menu (4-6 menu items seemed to be the average)before you decide where you want to eat.  The menu variety was great! There were restaurants with pizza, burgers, BLTs, Pork, indian inspired items and rice bowls to name a few.  I went with a BLT with an egg on top and it was delicious!

I have heard that they change the restaurants, so I will for sure come back to test it out again.  It was a little cramped, but I sort of think it fit the type of place it was."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Perfect for a group so everyone can get what they want and try new items! The pizza is absolutely perfect... all of them! They also have a great happy hour with a great variety of drinks. Been here a couple times and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious ceviche but VERY pricey!! I liked the layout of this place though. There are 4 different chefs and those 4 rotate every few weeks. My friend got the duck carnitas which were 10/10. Cute atmosphere-- very hipster like."}
{"text":"Thanks to Breanna B for recommending this place!

I cannot even begin to describe how much I love this concept and how successful this execution was!

The concept of having restaurant incubator in a city is a great concept, a way to get new chefs started in the crazy business of owning and operating a restaurant. 

For a consumer this concept is great because you get to try what new ideas the new chefs are coming up with and if you have picky friends, they'll find something in the many options available.

I decided to try Colonia, because I have a weakness for Latin cuisine, and I love the idea of a restaurant exploring the less mainstream options for Latin food. I loved the pupusas and pao de queijo.

My friends selected Brunoise and Iron Born for their lunches and we were very happy with the food.

The drinks were equally tasty, all in all a very successful outing.

Our only issue was with service, some of the people that work there seem to be unfriendly and a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps this should be part of their training, customer service."}
{"text":"A new and different type of restaurant. There are four dining options bringing a variety of food choices. The chefs and servers are friendly to the customers. It's a very welcoming and open environment. You order food at any of the four restaurant choices and choose your own seating and the food will be brought to you. It's definitely a unique dining experience, as they say."}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to love this place but couldn't ...why? The food was average. Great vibe ... Happy hour prices on drinks were VERY reasonable . I had to check with the bartender to be sure she got all of the drink order for my group! We tried a bunch of different items from 3 of the chef stalls....nothing was great ... Most were ok ... Too many choices in the city to go back for me"}
{"text":"Okay....so I too was at the infamous 6/30 lunch hour where I ordered the Colonia mussels.  The other reviewers were absolutely correct. Came to the table and smelled like the B.O. of the kid you knew in 6th grade, as they transition into adulthood and don't yet wear deodorant reguarly. I just assumed I wasn't \"appreciating\" the fine cuisine of which I was being served, and decided to eat anyway.  But the smell was so bad.  I feel vindicated in my disgust knowing that they were probably spoiled and for some reason they served them anyways.  I have a feeling the head chef wasn't there at the time (it was lunch) or else he would've not allowed these to go out.  They were gritty and I honestly have no idea what happened. I honestly am willing to forgive and try another item on their menu, but it doesn't bode well that they served very obviously rancid mussels to the public.  Surprised no one got sick.  Just don't order the mussels...ever.

 IronBorn was delicious and I can't wait to go back and order the white pizza.  

So yeah, honestly have to give Colonia 2 stars (I don't suspect malicious intent, but the other reviews mentioning these gives me pause) and Ironborn gets 5 stars.  Will be checking out the other two restaurants soon."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Smallman Galley! I've been here at least 10 times and it never disappoints. The idea of a restaurant incubator is genius. So many options for food, fully loaded bar and awesome staff. If you don't go, your missing out. Pictures is the white pizza from Ironborn pizza, a Detroit style pizza. It's thick, but light and the flavors are great. I recommend the spicy pie. It is topped with honey to tone down the spice and incredible! Smallman is a must go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience at Smallman Galley.  There were so many food choices and everything I saw going out looked delicious.  I had the Shrimp and Grits and it was prepared perfectly.  The seating area was comfortable for our group of 5.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Diverse selection of cuisine and delicious as always. Had a large party with babies in tow and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate us, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool place. Awesome  and truly innovative concept, great vibe, and perfect for the most particular of eaters."}
{"text":"Wow! Who new you could get good food outside of Brooklyn.  Turns out there is a place and it's in Pittsburgh. Never mind waiting in line for Pamela's P&G Diner go to Small Man Gallery. Food options are fire. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed. Food is WONDERFUL at each restaurant! Creative concept, great location and good prices!"}
{"text":"Was served spoiled mussels that were horrible on the nose. I tried two that seemed better than the rest and they had not been debearded and were very gritty.

Bar service was quick because they weren't listening closely enough to pour the correct beer despite it being ordered twice."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this amazing chef is no longer at Smallman. 

 Love love love Aubergine!  Stopped on my way to the airport to pick up lunch... so absolutely yummy!!!!  Addicted to chef RAF's food... flavorful, beautiful presentation and wrapped (I have a tendency to drop)

I actually got the pork belly omelet today couldn't even stop to take a picture... OMG!  Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing but the overall experience is confusing and the service is lacking. There is no one to greet you when you come in or explain to you how this works, which I think would be super helpful.. I also think it would be much nicer if you could actually be seated with menus and time to decide instead of running back and forth down the lines squeezing between people to try to read each restaurant's chalk board menu. I feel bad for the restaurant staff too, frantically running around trying to track you down after you finally find a table which in itself is an almost impossible task. Once we got our food we realized we had no silverware or waters and had to track down a staff member to ask for them. Also sucks that if you want to have a couple drinks with your meal you have to continually get up and leave your table and wait at the bar to get served.. As I said the food was really great but the overall setup and experience could be majorly improved and is what will keep me from returning. It was more work and stress rather than a nice, relaxing meal out."}
{"text":"I went a few weeks ago with a friend around 2:00 in the afternoon. There weren't many people there, but the service and food was fantastic. You walk up to one of the different restaurant groups, order your meal and they'll bring it over to your table. Great food, great experience.

As a side note, as I was getting out of my car a gentlemen approached me informing me he was just released from prison and would like to exchange his wedding band with me for cash for a greyhound bus. The more he talked, the more it sounded like a scam. I'm not sure if this is a common thing around this area in the Strip, but keep this one in mind if you do check this place out."}
{"text":"Great variety of food. Lots of people on the weekend and therefore long lines. Will try again on the next round of restaurants they have inside."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are THE REAL DEAL.  So delicious.

I first tried this place during a yelp event and I just KNEW I had to return. 

Four chefs in one space, incubating. Testing and planning menu's. It's incredible. I found myself just wanting to eat everything they had to offer. I enjoyed the crispy chicken skin sandwich/bahn mi. It was absurdly delicious. 

This is a place you can keep returning to and it will NEVER be the exactly same, always just as good but different. I cannot wait to try all the new chefs."}
{"text":"I'm going to agree with the consensus that this place has an awesome concept. Was it executed well? Meh, not really. I say this because the method of ordering and seating is similar to a food court in the mall. You pick what you want and you find yourself a seat. Because seating at such a hip joint is first come first serve, it becomes pretty cutthroat to find a space for you and your party. You'll find yourself having to save a spot while others go order or vice versa. At least at the mall, there's plenty of seating so you can decide where to sit after you have your food. 

In terms of food, the menu and selections will change out so what I say about the food now won't matter in the years to come. However, my thoughts on the food will be towards the Provision restaurant and I can't say I was entirely impressed. I ordered the Banh Mi made with crispy chicken skins and the hubby ordered the burger. Although I give the chef credit for creativity, I think the crispy chicken skins gave the banh mi too crispy of a texture. It lacked a substantial protein to balance the already crispy texture of the baguette. The burger wasn't anything to stand out amongst it's competition in the city. My least favorite part of my meal was the fries and maybe it's because of personal preference, but my fries were fried so crispy that they tasted like those refried last bits that have sat at the bottom of the fryer all day. You know what I'm talking about? 

Anyway, the concept is great. I wouldn't completely cross this off my list as I know menus will rotate every so often. Looking forward to what they bring in next."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Always fresh and tons of variety. 

The first round of chefs offered Provision, Aubergine, Carota, and Josephine's toast if memory serves correct. All were great. 

Fast forward to 2018 and Provision has advance to Federal Galley (definitely worth checking out) and the new options include: 

Iron Born Pizza: THE BRUNCH PIE IS TO DIE FOR!! This place offers Michigan style pizza which I didn't know what that was but now it's all I ever want! 

Banhmilicious: Pittsburgh needed more Vietnamese options and this place delivers. The Banh mi on the brunch menu is AMAZING but everything has been great. 

Colonia: Brazilian food which I would be lying if I said I tried. I've heard nothing but rave reviews however they do run out of some menu offerings early :/ 

Brunoise: Did I just become a kid again? Cinnamon Toast Crunch Macarons!? & I've heard from a very reliable source the best burger in the burgh! 

So why just 4 stars? They layout is a little cramped but much improved with Federal Galley! Additionally they offer a bar and coffee shop which is awesome but I think the coffee shop detracts from the chefs offerings since some of them have coffee drinks and the baristas can be a little... rude. 

If you're reading this though call that Uber & get to smallman ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Just made it to Smallman Galley this week with a friend and it definitely lived up to the hype! I love the concept of the chef incubator and the space is such a great addition to the Strip District! 

It was early enough to grab a seat at the bar for happy hour, which by the way is awesome. Half off all drinks and wine from 5-7 pm!? I was thrilled to find a happy hour that extends past 6:00! I started with the Strictly Business cocktail and it was wonderful - a mix of Boyd & Blair, cinnamon and ginger beer. The perfect winter cocktail. I also love how each chef also has a hand in the cocktail selections for the menu. 

Now onto the food. We started with the mushroom and brie toast from Josephine's Toast and it was excellent! The perfect amount of melted brie and various mushrooms. Then we shared both the beef and pork meatballs and the fresh pasta from Aubergine. Both were phenomenal. The pasta had root vegetables tossed with pesto and parmesan. And the meatballs were served over mashed potatoes which we loved! 

Currently, I can only speak to Josephine's and Aubergine in regards to food, but I certainly will be back to try others. Once again, another solid addition to our food scene here in Pittsburgh. Smallman Galley is worth the hype - get there!"}
{"text":"OMG, the Pizza was amazing. What a great concept, 4 different restaurants in one location."}
{"text":"Being from New York, I had been craving a concept like this one here in Pittsburgh. I was so used to having a fast-casual, counter-service environment where sharing multiple different types of food with friends was a possibility. I know, I know - you can share food anywhere. But at Smallman Galley, you can mix and match cuisines that don't often appear on the same menu at a typical establishment.

OK - I had been asking my friends to try the place for a while before they eventually obliged. I'll admit, the first visit struck an odd chord with them as they weren't used to this kind of system (ordering food at the counter separately from ordering drinks at the bar, receiving a number to wait at the table, etc.) I think a few of them left still confused as to the purpose. 

I tend to enjoy the environment, though it may be a product of high familiarity with this process. The FOOD WAS AMAZING, so it all ends up worth it in the end if this process isn't really your thing. The first time I went, I got a roast that is no longer on the rotating menu at Aubergine Bistro. It was so tender it fell apart on my fork, but what really astounded me was the rice it was served with! I don't know that I've ever had better rice. I tend to frequent Josephine's Toast, as I am a sucker for a good avocado toast. They accomplish flavors with their avocado toast that I just can't accomplish at home (plus, their bacon is a home run - crispy and thick, yum!). You want tostadas? Provision has you covered! And oh man, are they good.

There is something for everyone at Smallman Galley - an ideal place to visit with a group who struggle to agree on a common food theme for a night out. And if you're thinking of brunch and coffee - let's just say, when my friend visited from Cincinnati, she deemed the latte she ordered the BEST latte she has ever had. In this day and age of trendy, so-so coffee spots, a good latte is refreshing to find.

Now that the cravings are coming back, I'm sure I'll be back very soon. I want to be sure I visit again before the chefs change over - four new chefs will be debuting this year! How exciting!"}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant and welcoming birthday party of six of us (as hosts) and 15+ more people here. The staff was super helpful, and the food was also delicious. Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and was one of my favorite spots that my friend took me to while I was visiting Pittsburgh the other weekend! (Other favorite spot was Umami)  I wish that more cities had something like this to get local restauranteurs up and running; I am actually really surprised that Seattle doesn't have something similar! And if they do, you should reply here on my post so I can go there and eat immediately! 
I was with a large group of people and since the space is so big, there was plenty of room for all of us. We got there fairly early in the day, so the food was just getting up and running and we had a few cocktails while we waited. The Smallman Galley Bar puts their drink menus in old VHS cassette cases- is that genius or what? I love when people recycle stuff like that- makes it a little more memorable. What was not memorable was the cocktail that I had because I had already been drinking. I just remember that it was good as hell and every one of my friend's drinks that I had was good also.
The food from the restaurants is a little pricey, but I tried some of the steak tartare from Brunoise and I could have eaten an entire platter of it if the opportunity existed. 
Great location, great concept, and delicious food/drink. Definitely need to try this place if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Went to Smallman Galley for a private work event. The space was very beautiful- we had the outside space that is enclosed by the building. It was perfect for a medium sized group (15-20). The bartender was friendly and helpful and drinks were all strong. The staff were helpful telling us what was gluten free. Because it was buffet style food- it ended up being a little on the luke warm/cold side. I would definitely go back to try the experience as a diner and not a party guest- I've heard good things. There was plenty of parking available and it's nice location."}
{"text":"This is a unique spot in the Strip! I went with a few friends for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was a little congested, but it wasn't very hard to find a seat. I love the environment, and it is a cool concept. There are four different restaurants to choose from, each with a small menu, and all of them have a unique flair to them. I tried a burger at Brunoise. It was very good, but it was the bun was a little too buttery for my taste. The burger was cooked to perfection though, and the hollandaise mayo, cheese, and egg were delicious together. 

While I enjoyed the experience, it may be a little bit before I venture back. The concept is a little overwhelming for me, and if I didn't have a seasoned vet with me, I probably would have panicked. They do rotate restaurants every 6 months to a year, so I will def keep my eyes out for the change. I didn't get to try any alcoholic bevs, but it looked like they had a decent selection."}
{"text":"One of the most unique restaurant concepts in the city and a strip classic - this place doesn't disappoint! I tried the chicken & biscuits from Home for brunch and they were amazing! I added an egg to the top which definitely added some flavor profile. I also grabbed a Threadbare cider from the bar. I love with yinzers support yinzers so I'm all about local brews being available! 

As cool of a space as it is, and an ideal setting in the strip, it's extremely expensive. I'm all about a good innovative place, but it was steep. However, I'll be back because I want to try all the chefs!"}
{"text":"I tell everyone I know about Smallmann. The food, atmosphere, and friendly staff always exceed my expectations. Tonight's menu included: the Mac and cheese, red pizza, white pizza, flank steak and two specially made drinks. The bartender was amazing and cooked me up something fruity that was off menu. My sisters and I enjoyed every bite of our food. My only compliant is the space restriction. They hosted a private event tonight so half of the dining room was closed. The event looked beautiful, but the rest of the space was a hot mess. Super congested, servers struggling to find space. Overall the food was super good as usual. I will always return."}
{"text":"The Smallman Galley provides a place for incoming chefs to test out their menu before launching their own restaurant. The \"incubator\" concept is quite unique and since I support small businesses and aspiring chefs, I love this place. There are currently 4 chefs with 4 different menus. The food can be hits or misses, but the chefs are open to discussing about it. 

-------Specifically for PROVISION------

My favorite concept when I visited was Chef Stephen's PROVISION. I was drawn to his unique fusion of flavors. The sample of banh mi with crispy chicken skin he provided was delicious. In addition, I ordered a side of loaded fries with roasted squash, lentils, goat cheese, lemon aioli and herbs. I couldn't pin point the squash though, but tasted the aioli and it suited the dish well. 

Provision is definitely on the right track with the right flavors in the right proportions. I would give it 5-stars, but as a Vietnamese, I'm kind of butthurt that they misspelled \"BANH MI\". I mentioned it in person during my visit and I hope it's fixed. A menu is like a resume; it is my first impression of the establishment. It might seem like a small error, but as a consumer it's slightly off-putting and raises doubts about the quality/expertise. Other than that, great job Provision and I look forward to your full blast launch!"}
{"text":"Good place, original concept. Can select from four different options. I happen to find portions small but it might be just me."}
{"text":"So, I like the concept of smallman galley. It is like a long term public market setup, where the chefs stay for a set period of time. There are 4 restaurants, a coffee shop, and a bar within the galley. I have tried food from all of the chefs and it is all amazing. 

Of note:
Brunch at Josephine's toast- so basically add an egg to any of the toasts and they are AMAZING! I like the avocado smashed toast with fried egg on top. 
Provision smothered fries-OMG yes! These are the kind of fries that I would call frites, and they are sooo good. Such a weird mix of flavors (squash, lentils, goat cheese), but it completely works. MMMMMMMmmmmmm.

Another thing to keep in mind, you can have private events here! I looked really hard into having my wedding reception here. It was just a little too small for my event, but it would be amazing for something else."}
{"text":"TLDR: great establishment, highly recommend the chicken curry on the chefs menu- authentic flavor and perfect taste! 

Banhmilicious is a great fusion Vietnamese food establishment. I ordered the chef's special chicken curry (basically a Thai Red curry) and it tasted highly authentic with all the right herbs and spices. It wasn't too spicy, and had just the right amount of sweetness from the squash. It was the type of flavor combination that even though the spice hurts, you keep wanting more. The chicken was also tender and juicy, complementing the curry sauce very nicely. One personal preference I very much enjoyed was use of the short grain white rice as opposed to long grain.

However, my friend ordered the meatball noodle soup, and the flavor although unique was questionable at best. There was too much allspice in the broth which led to some conflicting flavor profiles.

The ambiance and environment is very modern hipster/ deconstructed. Along with the service, this place ranks high amongst dining options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of Smallman Galley!  It is such a cozy and fun atmosphere, and it is so great to be able to choose from such a wide array of options.  Everyone can really find something they will enjoy."}
{"text":"It lives up to the hype.  Went on a Friday night & got there in enough time to get a seat.  Ordering food was easy -- ordering a drink, not so much.  Granted, it was happy hour & I didn't expect super speedy service and they met that expectation.  S-l-o-w service with a frown.  But back to the food.  It was easy to order -- but hard to decide.  I love the idea of being able to mix & match menus.  The cheddar-apple grilled cheese and ricotta tart were tasty enough not to share:-)  
I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Interesting concept! 4 unique and different chef styles in one restaurant.  We had beef chuck and wine, chicken pot pie and rancheros from the Aubergine Cafe, golden milk tea from the Carota Cafe and apple and almond upside-down cake from Josephine's toast. They were all delicious :-)"}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh, filling, and healthy! Love the environment and drinks! A must dine in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink options. Must try place in the strip. It's noisy and sometimes tough to get a seat, but if you hang around, you'll definitely find a spot to sit and eat for 2-4 people."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with a large group of friends--order cafeteria style, no need to deal with he hassle of splitting checks, and sit down together at a large table in the dining area, and people will still be by to clean up for you.  

They had 4 different \"styles\" of menus to order from, from burgers to octopus to gourmet toast. I had the pierogi toast, and honestly I've had better pierogis, but still wouldn't complain.  The bar has a wide selection of beers on tap and cocktails. The layout makes for a great atmosphere and overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The emperor has no clothes! Look, I get what they're trying to do. I applaud the effort to try something new in Pittsburgh. I understand the concept of the  chef incubator. But their claim that you don't need reservations and can easily find a table was not the case on Saturday night. We struggled to find a table for two amid a cacophonous throng. We found ourselves taking off items of apparel just to save a table. The first thing you have to do is find your table. Take off your jacket to save your table, and then step up to the bar to order drinks. You have fight for a place at the bar. You fight for a place at the restaurants. You are spoken to a bit brusquely at the restaurant because they are inundated by orders. This would normally be an activity that would be only witnessed by your server in a traditional restaurant.  Then you make your way back to your seat and shoo away people wondering if your table is available. Once your food comes , you wander aimlessly around looking for a clean Fork. The station where in the cutlery and napkins reside is devoid of clean utensils. You can't find a fork. You give up and go to the restaurant and ask someone at the restaurant at which you ordered to find you a fork. Five minutes later, they courteously come with a fork. Sound like a relaxing evening?

I sat there and watched women in high heels and evening dress bussing their own tables. To be fair, our food was excellent. We ordered the roasted chicken and the prawns carbonara. I had a lentil salad which was delectable. I have absolutely no argument with the quality of the food. I give the food 4 out of 5 Stars. It was inventive and tasty. It was served in a timely fashion. The beleaguered line cook even brought it out to my table. This brings up another topic. In my past trips to the smallman Galley when purchasing food, there has been a opportunity to tip. It was my belief when I tipped my server that I was tipping for service. Generally, at the Smallman Galley, I am walking up to the register and placing my order. I pay for my order. I go back to my seat. When my order is ready, I get up, get my silverware, and bring the plate back to the table. I am assuming that the payment for the food covers the salary of the employees who work there and that there is no need for tipping.

So, in closing, to be fair, you will get an excellent meal. You'll get a very decent drink. But you will pay pretty much what you will pay at a high-end restaurant. For two people with drinks and main course with side, salad, and appetizer we paid about $135 for our evening at Smallman Galley. But I wonder how long it's going to take the throngs of people jamming into the restaurant to figure out that that is what they could pay for an evening out at a nice restaurant and not have to bus their own tables, fight for a spot ordering., look for a fork, fight for a spot at the bar to order a drink, etcetera. Saturday, after a tough work week, should not be a slog and a fight at your favorite restaurant.

But all of this is not to say that Smallman Galley does not have its merits. I think the execution just needs some work. If they had servers and Runners and tableside ordering with iPads or other electronic devices,  the system would work much better. You wouldn't have to fight for a spot at a restaurant. You wouldn't have to bus your own tables. You wouldn't have to fight for a fork. And the tip that you leave would be truly Justified. This is a good idea. The execution though is horrible and needs work if this business model is to continue. And by the way, don't believe that a seat is a foregone conclusion at this restaurant on a busy night. 4 stars for the food, 0 stars for the experience of dining out to equal an average of 2 Stars."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, how have I not written a review for one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh? Smallman Galley absolutely makes my top 5 list. It's such an incredible space - when you walk in, you'll find a bar sprawled out on one side, four kitchens operating on the other, and seating for eager diners available in the back.

The four kitchens thing isn't just fantastic because an entire group of people can come in and mix and match any variety of entrees or appetizers from different vendors, allowing them all to try a variety of cooking styles and flavors. The best part about the space is that it provides those kitchens and their chefs with an operating space for 18 months - that's 18 months to finalize strategies, build a fan base, and hit the ground running when the chefs head on out into what is becoming a very competitive city with lots of high quality dining options.

To date, I've sampled a handful of items and loved every single one of them. Loaded fries from Provision's? Utterly delicious - and Provision's asparagus and eggs proved during another visit that they have the ability to serve lighter, healthier fare, too. Speaking of, the zucchini grilled cheese from Carota Cafe? Fantastically fresh - it's my favorite item from Smallman Galley to date, even including the egg-and-vegetable laden breakfast sandwich they served up for me earlier this year.

Unfortunately, I'm not in the Strip as often as I would like, and so my number of dining experiences here are still in the single digits. But I have never been disappointed here, and even when the current line-up of chefs heads out into the city, I know that I'll be returning to Smallman to enjoy its next four kitchen start-ups - and to enjoy a few more libations at the bar, which just add to the overall unique experience in this little Pittsburgh gem. Do yourself a favor and stop in here soon if you can - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Much better than the federal galley. Great beer selection and the food is always on point"}
{"text":"We liked this place though we were confused since it was our first time.  It's sort of like a stations type deal. Each place is its own business you pay there and they'll bring food to you or give your drink right away. 

We ordered beer at the bar then walked over to the other side and got food from one of the vendors. We then found a seat back at the bar and our food was brought to us. We tried all specials and they were good though have changed since. 

We want to go back and try another food vendor and get cocktails next time. The cocktails looked good though a bit expensive."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!! I always get sad when my favorite restaurant moves out (Provision) but then an equally fantastic one (Iron Born) moves in its place. I love coming here with larger groups of people because it's easy for everyone to find something they love, and the huge tables with the benches accommodate larger parties well. There's always something new, so you can come here often and it's won't get old."}
{"text":"I loved the options and the variety. The shrimp/fish curry was amazing! I can't wait to go back and try another restaurant. What a great, unique experience. I would recommend for tourists and when guest are in town. Small man is a great addition to pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great concept! I really love the idea of housing different possible starter restaurants under one building. I believe each restaurant is there for a short period of time to allow them to test their dishes and really hone in on their skills as a chef, test their dishes, raise money, and build their customer base. It's a just fun and exciting environment for their customers too. I love it!

Overall I feel like I'm watching chopped because of their open kitchen and it looks like their competing but their not. Maybe for customers! Ha! Currently there are four restaurants: Provision, Aubergine, Josephine's Toast, and Carota Cafe.

Provision: you can't go wrong because they're safe and serve burgers and sandwiches with a twist. I really love the ingredients. However, some of their ingredients did not pair well together. I've tried their take on a bahn mi sandwich and while I did think it was unique and interesting, I didn't think it was great. I was wanting something meaty other than the crispy skins. The rice pudding dessert sounded like a cool combination of flavors (strawberries, rice pudding, bread, cream) but it was terrible. I like how they think outside of the box and aren't afraid to try out new things! Love the GF options as well!

Aubergine: I love love love it! I've had their deconstructed pot pie and it was amazing! Pan seared mackerel was perfect and served with carolina rice. I've never had that kind of rice before and it was so delicious and paired well with the fish. Kale and grits (GF option) is amazing! I'm from the south and Aubergine made it perfectly! That's how you make grits! (also your google website to leave comments isn't working). I've had other dishes here and I have nothing but great things to rave about! 

Carota Cafe: looks like they have some great options. I think they would do excellent as well. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the cafe yet because of the other the overpowering wonderful options the other restaurants offer. Sorry! But I believe you'll do great things!

Josephine's Toast: I love the toast! My favorite is the smashed avocado and the egg, if you can eat it, is a must! I also love the beet/salad greens & the mushroom toast. Yum! I wanted to try the pineapple/cottage cheese but I'm allergic to pineapples.

Would like to try their brunch menu's sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place every since we moved to Pittsburgh a year ago. We finally carved out a Friday night and three of us went to Smallman Galley for dinner before a night out.

It was packed. I guess our mistake was coming on a Friday night. I get that it's a cafeteria-style place, but when you're looking for seating for two hours it really kills your experience. This place is way too small for how popular it is. It doesn't help that they serve alcohol so people just camp out all night.

The pizza place was sold out and the other places were sold out of a lot of options as well. Some of them didn't even have time to mark what was sold out so I waited in line for 20 minutes to get a tea at one point and then was told they didn't have any.

We never did find seating. I waited in a random line that us customers had kind of established and when I was at the front of the line, oblivious people kept just taking seats. Not against the rules, though, since the line wasn't official or anything. It was just chaos. 

We ate our food standing up in a random corner. I don't remember if it was good because I was just so angry about standing and hot from the crowded room.

This being said, I would like to try it again on a slower night. I'll post an update if I ever make it back."}
{"text":"Really fun concept and the food I had was exceptional!  Its confusing when you enter as to how to \"do things\" ..like order.. so go with a friend (like I did) who can show you the ropes...  Once I got the hang of it - it made sense to me and I'd definitely go back because the food was amazing!  4 stars because the food is amazingly over-priced as well so I won;t be a regular customer here.
  Still, it was crowded on a Sunday morning so Pittsburgher's are loving the concept..and I have to say, its a really great way to try good food from various 'restaurants' all in one meal... I liked that."}
{"text":"Review on the coffee. small servings, expensive and shit service. get coffee at Primo's instead"}
{"text":"Cool idea, food is pricey and get be hit or miss, sometimes great sometimes average, drinks well done and lots of room at bar (usually)"}
{"text":"This is just what Pittsburgh needed and I would love to see another place with the same concept open up in another neighborhood, perhaps Lawrenceville.  I love the concept of an incubator and enjoy going so much."}
{"text":"Don't come in if it is 30 minutes before closing. They are out of a lot of food. It's a fun hip place and they have alcohol but I cannot speak for the food. The strip is dead on a Tuesday night so go eat somewhere else if it is 830pm or later."}
{"text":"This review is for Colonia. I had the skirt steak with chimichurri. It was the perfect combination of charring, spice and caramelization.  Had a few bites from the other plates in the group.  Needless to say, I have to go back to try the other restaurants. This place is a must go."}
{"text":"Great foods on rotation. Nice decor. Great concept and innovative ideas. Prices (although kitchen specific) were a bit on the high side, including house-regulated  beers- and $12 for a standard Cab/Bordeaux blend glass. One really nice friendly busser girl. The bartender forgot our order (of 3 drinks) and had to ask twice again. Then brought the wrong beer. She brought a dark red malty, un hoppy beer, after I ordered a brew gents IPA. No thanks. Given all that, I will be back, maybe try a mixed drink or something."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday. It was crowded but there was plenty of seats available and the wait time for food was only about 20 minutes. Smallman Galley is an innovative concept and indicative of the forward thinking happening right now in the Pittsburgh food scene.

My husband had a ramen noodle dish from Aubergine it was good but the broth was a little under-seasoned. I got the herb eggs from Carota cafe. They were absolutely delicious. I also got toast from Toast with espresso hazelnut butter and blackberry jam- very yummy. 

One issue that we encountered (and I don't know if this can be fixed) is that when people in your party order from different venues the food comes at different times, which I guess is a naturally result of this type of set up.

We will certainly be back. This will be a go to when we have out of town guests and we want to show off our city!"}
{"text":"I went here for my bachelorette dinner. It was the perfect place, with lots of options for all. Not one person had a complaint about their food. In fact not one person did not rave about their food. It is a fun and safe way to take a bunch of people with lots of different taste presences while at the same time staying classy and fun. This place is what Pittsburgh needed!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for Iron Born. WOWWW! This pizza was amazing (Red pie). Goey, but crispy on the edges. Pepperoni had a little heat and was the perfect amount of greasy but crunchy on the edges as well. Cheese was flavorful and perfectly melted but not stringy while you're trying to pull the piece away from your mouth. I am seriously craving more of this pizza, and I'm normally a thin crust only type of gal. 

The pie was a bit more expensive than your corner pizza shop, but it's obvious why from the quality of the ingredients. You can just taste a big difference, especially in sauce and cheese. Also, one pie was definitely enough for me and my gal pal, thought two people with a larger appetite should maybe go for something else along with this."}
{"text":"I'm always willing to explore new and exciting places in Pittsburgh, so when a friend told me about this place I was eager to try it.  While I've only had the pizza, which was good, not great.  I'm giving this place 3 stars primarily I did not enjoy the ambiance or layout, the food was good and I would eat there again if it were not for the layout of this place.  I was not a fan of how congested this place was.  I'm all for businesses making as much money as they can and I fully support putting as many table settings as you can, to create a strong flowing revenue however not when it comes to sacrificing peoples personal space and the comfortable intimacy you look for when going out to eat.  I look for an experience, the last thing I want is to feel anxiety and that's what I got from this place."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and came across this location while walking through the strip district. 

There are 4 different food vendors to choose from within this location, so it is nice if different people you are with want different things. 

You order at the counter of the food vendor that you want and then sit at a table, that you choose, and they bring the food to you. There is bus staff that then brings you a bottle of water and glasses. 

There is a pizza vendor, banh mi, american food and mexican, I think was the other. 

I really liked the vibe of the place. We would definitely be regulars, if we lived local."}
{"text":"Great place in the strip district. 5 star for originality. It's uncommon to find a place with start up chefs that make gourmet food. We went with Provisions.I had the burger of the day done medium served on a crispy toasted sesame bun. The flavor and spices were one of a kind~ The restaurant is vibrant, modern & hip. We'd love to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Love the variety and pizza, people are really nice too."}
{"text":"Had the best dish I ate all summer last night at Carota Cafe - summer beans with heirloom cherry tomatoes, walnuts, shallots and a nice vinaigrette - tasted like everything had just been picked!  Great price point and a neat, communal table environment."}
{"text":"I've tried to write a review for Smallman Galley at least three other times, but always have to stop because I feel like my view of this place is so different than most of the other reviews I see. I've been there at least five different occasions, and have tried a multitude of their brunch, dinner, and dessert options. I honestly wasn't truly impressed by anything I had there, except for dessert and the occasional dinner entree. I really want to like this cool concept with nice staff and pretty decor, but I have never been that happy at the end of a meal there.

I've sampled food from the restaurants that were there before, as well as the new ones. I've paid up to $12 for avocado toast and although it was delicious, it can be a little unsatisfactory to pay so much for a baguette and a small side salad. I tried the toast at \"toast\" previously and enjoyed their options more and spent less money. I should have tried the berries, cream, and crumble this weekend, but instead chose the avocado baguette. I regretted it almost immediately after ordering. In the past I've had different egg dishes, sandwiches, butterscotch pudding, and lukewarm shrimp and grits. This time I tried a Brazilian breakfast sandwich, pancakes (delicious), baguette with avocado, and the side of beans in my boyfriends steak and eggs entree (which he loved). 

So my friends food was pretty good and my boyfriend liked his meal a lot, but I was not on the same page...again. After this visit, I also told my boyfriend that I am only going back to Smallman Galley to try out their new dinner options and if I'm still not enthusiastic about the food, then I won't be back again... until maybe they change out their restaurant again because for whatever reason I want to like this place SO BAD...."}
{"text":"We loved this place. After months of saying we'd check it out we finally made it for a Saturday brunch and it did not disappoint.
I had the pork belly ramen from Aubergine, which was absolutely flavorful. Everything was fresh. I chugged the broth down at the end. It was that good.

My spouse got the ham and eggs from Provisions. The ham was carmelized and thick. I believe it was the best I'd ever tasted. We also shared a pudding for dessert. The little crunchier on the whipped cream were evenly split between bites so we could savor their autumn like taste.

I'm giving the galley 4 stars because it took some time to figure out how to order, are there servers, is there a drink menu, what the heck do we do here environment. But we will be back now that we sort of get it."}
{"text":"Smallman Market is a restaurant incubator that allows chefs to test out the Pittsburgh market, make and save some money, test out recipes, and grow brand awareness - all with the goal of these chefs and restauranteurs opening their own stand-alone restaurants in the future. It's basically four restaurants in one, and you can sample and mix and match to your heart's content, so there is literally something for everyone. An absolute must-go!"}
{"text":"What a unique concept (to us suburbanites, anyway)!  We met my BF's son and GF here for a late brunch on Sunday and while the place was packed, the food was delivered promptly and was simply delicious. I had a Bloody Mary which was the perfect blend of tangy tomato chased by the right amount of horseradish zest. A bit pricey for $9 for well vodka but it was still one of the best I have had.  I ordered Paedo Que Jo (can't spell it or pronounce it) but it was damn good.  A very different twist on a traditional breakfast sandwich.  My BF has a Brazilian something or other with eggs and chorizo and it was delicious as well.  I would definitely go here again, most likely when I'm not trying to diet (!) but it was well worth the cheat."}
{"text":"I really like Smallman Galley.  It's such a great place to go and get GOOD food with a group of people, especially if everyone's in the mood for something different. 

It's a really awesome way to try out new food and cuisine that doesn't break the bank.  I love the laidback atmosphere.  Last week I had this amazing carrot butternut soup (I think that's what it was called!) and bread for $7. My friend's ordered heftier meals and we were all satisfied.  I like that ability to get what you want and not be tied down to a specific menu.

I've been here twice and food has been excellent both times.  Friends got different assortments of items and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"I go here pretty often for lunch- it's a good place for groups because of the communal seating and it's never very crowded.

I love going because I can choose my food based on my mood and everyone can find something they like!"}
{"text":"I think the idea of having a lot of up and coming chefs in the same place, like a startup incubator, is innovative and exciting. The ambiance is kind of like a very hip cafeteria, with lots of loud banter and art installations. There are both options for communal and individual/group tables- however you have to flag seating down yourself. Once you're able to flag down a table, it's a very fun experience for a bunch of friends, especially because it feels like you can be as rowdy as you want. However, the food didn't impress me that much considering the price point, so although it was a fun experience, I don't think I will be returning until new restaurants rotate in.

I went with some friends, and we tried all of the four restaurants there. I ordered the Molletes to share, and the Cochnita Pibil from Colonia. My other friends got the Red Pie, a Banh Mi, and a Risotto. We also got the S'mores from brunoise. 

I think the dish we were all most impressed with was the pizza. It was very fluffy and flavorful, and piping hot! One of my friends even said that they wanted to come back just for the pizza. The molletes were fine, but I expected more from the avocado puree. It was also kind of small as the only appetizer for 4 people...probably should have ordered another dish of something. I wished that the Cochnita Pibil had more going on, either in terms of the number of ingredients or packing more of a punch with the flavoring. I also wished that the portion of meat was larger. However, I was very glad to see some more Latin American options in Pittsburgh! Now if only I could find a good chilaquiles joint... My friend said that the risotto was overall good, but some complaints he had was that it was a little watery and the lemon flavoring was quite strong. My other friend who got the Banh Mi commented that there were better options for banh mi (that are also cheaper) in town. Finally, the S'mores dish was definitely as photogenic as photos on Yelp and Instagram suggest. Nothing to complain about there."}
{"text":"This place was great. Such a cool vibe with the way that it's set up and the multiple food options. 3 of the 4 meals we got were outstanding! The other item was a gourmet grilled cheese but unfortunately it lacked much flavor. All in all the Galley is pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for lunch and dinner, both during two different groups of restaurants and it was delicious every time! It's fun to go with adventurous friends who are down to share a few things from each kitchen so you can try them all. The concept is very cool and fits right in in Pittsburgh. 
The atmosphere is kind of noisy and hectic- very enjoyable, but definitely more of a casual meal out with friends than a quiet date kind of place. 
It can be a little confusing on your first visit to know how things work... You order and pay separately at each kitchen and get a number card so they can bring your food out to you, seat yourself anywhere, and grab plates and flatware from the various stacks around the seating areas. :)"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough nice things about this place. I wanted to go here because I love the fact that they develop new restaurants and built them up all while teaching them the way to run their own one day. I came here on a weekday afternoon for lunch with friends and had an amazing time. Each and every restaurant within this place was great! I have heard so many great things about the bar and will definitely be back to see what everyone is talking about. As far as food the pizza at Iron Born was definitely my favorite!! Highly recommend for a group of friends who can never decide where they want to go since there is something for everyone"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for a friend's wedding and found this place thanks to my Yelp friends and I'm glad I did. What a great concept! I ended up going with the burger of the moment from Provision with a side of the Provision fries. The burger was juicy, the fries were to die for- SO crispy. I grabbed a chai latte from their cafe and was tempted by their drink menu but I didn't give in to the temptation. I had some major food envy though because the ramen looked delicious. I love that you can order your food at the counter, have it be 5-star quality and not have to wait forever for it. I would definitely recommend it, for the food and for the experience!"}
{"text":"Address is actually 2016 small man street!!

Really fun cool concept where you can pick from 4 restaurants- order at the counter then give them your cell and you are texted when your order is ready. Nicer atmosphere than I expected, cafeteria style seating with bar located near seating.

Veggie perspective - definetly have a few options among the 4 restaurants- carota cafe had the most options so I went there for entree AND dessert

 Carota cafe review: (chef Jessica Lewis) I loved the kale and egg (great flavored fresh and though it doesn't look like a lot of food it filled me up) dish. Yucca fries were mediocre, perhaps I'm not used to yucca but very dry and chewy- the aioli was great tho! Lastly I finished the true chocolate babka which was perfect and not too sweet.  They gave me a small glass of the beet mulled wine which was delicious- and on the house! This was a limited opening - looking forward to more visits to the galley!

Update- just revisited and continued to be impressed by the veggie options available especially at carota cafe. At carota-I had the noodles and broth with soba noodles which was filling but I probably should have chosen something else. I did greatly enjoy the bread and spread (kabucha squash spread). We had the sundae at provision which was delicious (apple and cheddar biscuit with Apple icecream) although I do wish it had more icecream."}
{"text":"We went on a spur of the moment decision as I was not in the mood to cook.
We looked over the menus at all four booths and settled on one item from two of them and two from another.
We ordered short ribs with gnocci and salad from Home, a salmon poke from Banhmilicious along with Jasmine tea and an Arnold Palmer. We also got the 2 sauce pizza from Iron Born.
The only dish we were not impressed with was the salad. Too heavy in the mixed greens and kale, no lettuce really. 
My fav was the short ribs then the red side of the pizza. My son loved the salmon poke as did my husband and they both liked the white side of the pizza.
The food was terrific. I know, you are waiting for the but... Well, here it is. It was really expensive. It is cafeteria style. We get our own utensils and napkins, the seating is long tables where multiple parties can sit. (There are smaller tables too.) And for the four items and 2 drinks it was $80. We tipped at every stall, but really not certain why so much. We got numbers, sat down and they brought out our food. We did the rest.
Don't get me wrong, it would be a great night out with friends etc. But for our family, I was hoping for a lower price point.
We will probably go back, but for date night, instead of a quick bite."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. But after three visits, I just don't. Granted, two of those were special events and the food was minimal - but after a full-fledged meal a couple of weeks ago, I'm not into it. As far as the space goes - we were there on a busy Saturday night. While I expect to wait for a table anywhere on a Saturday, my issue with this setup is that there's really nowhere to wait and there's no system for signing up for tables, etc., so you're really left staring down a table to jump at the chance when it's vacant, and risk pissing someone else off that's been waiting just as long as you. It feels like a chaotic cafeteria. The food as I've experienced it is fine. I sort of enjoyed my toast but at $14 for two toasts, I think my dollars would be better off spent down the street at Gaucho to be honest.  Kudos for the concept. The drinks are great and the bar is fun but everything is so smashed together it just doesn't seem to lend itself to a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch today and was really impressed with the set-up.  You walk in and have 4 different restaurants to choose from.  Walk around and peruse their menus and see what you are interested in.  Place your order at the counter, each restaurant has their own, take a seat in the spacious seating areas, wait for a text message that your food is ready and then eat.  Pretty simple set-up, but can be confusing for 1st timers (I was one of them).

In addition to the four restaurant options, they do have a full service bar and a small coffee bar, all located with the 'galley'.

This is a unique and great place for brunch. Great food in a laid back and casual environment. Absolutely affordable. Give it a shot of you want to avoid the lines at the other brunch hot spots in the strip."}
{"text":"IRON BORN PIZZA:  This review is for Iron Born - It is fabulous!  Please accept that I am a bit of a pizza expert.  I eat pizza all over (Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, London, and Rome).

The Red Pie is EXCELLENT.  I had not had Detroit-style before.  It is amazing, or at least Iron Born's version is.  The crust is tall, but light - almost fluffy.  There is some yellow cheese on the edges that gets crispy and crunchy.  The sauce on top just works somehow.  This is a simple pie - basically a pepperoni.  It is about 6\" x 10\", cut into six pieces.

My friend got the spicy pie (can't remember the specific name), and he rated it very highly as well.  It has jalapeno and banana peppers, but he said it was not overwhelmingly spicy, but was just right.

I do not give five-star ratings very often.  This pizza earns it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Literally stumbled upon this place while doing Christmas shopping in the strip about a month ago. Tripped over the sign that they had out front and realized that they put a new restaurant in....my husband and I stopped in for a latte and an Americano. This is one of the only places I have found that offer almond milk for their drinks- double bonus! We talked to the cashiers, who were super friendly, about the concept of the restaurant itself and also about the bar. We didn't order anything else, but spent a long time looking at the menus and they all seemed to be innovative and diverse. Can't wait to come back here for possibly a happy hour to try some snacks and drinks. 

Dropped a star because my latte was lukewarm."}
{"text":"This is a very nice space and nice concept. When we visited there were 4 different \"new restaurants\" that all seemed great! Whatever we tried was amazing and I think that's a great way to promote local and upcoming restaurants. I hope there will be more similar \"restaurant incubators\" like this in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I really really really love this place! The food, the concept, the drinks - it's awesome! I have had something from every current restaurant there and have never been disappointed. My current favorites are the Smothered Fries from Provision (the goat cheese and lentils are delicious and they're a perfect dish to share with the table) and the Shrimp and Squid Ink Pasta from Aubergine Bistro, but you really can't go wrong. I would happily visit each of these restaurants if/when they become independent standalone locations!

I love that you can come here numerous times and never get bored! I'm a fan for brunch but what I found out recently is that they have some pretty great Happy Hour specials too (half off all beer, wine, and cocktails... WHAT?) so it's definitely become a go-to dinner spot for me as well.

I can't wait to see where these chefs take their restaurants, and to see what happens in 8 months when the next class of chefs come on board!!"}
{"text":"How anyone could not give this place 5 stars blows my mind.  I went here with my wife and two friends for a late second lunch on Saturday.  Let me start by saying that the concept is great.  It's basically a mall foodcourt for foodies (with stiff cocktails and reclaimed wooden tables standard!).  

Everything I ate here was excellent. My main dish was a fried asian rice with sausage and eggs mixed in; so so so good.  As was the pork belly ramen.  Will definitely go back the next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept of this place!  Four aspiring restaurateurs are mentored and given a place to mature their ideas and personal notions.  They get to run a restaurant without having the typical fears of most start up restaurants.  The guys that developed this place are two U.S. Navy Lieutenants.  They really hit a gold mine with the implementation of Smallman Galley.  

On to brunch, and why we were here.  We had just finished running in the Great Race.  We walked in looked around at the different menus and grabbed a seat at the bar.  This is essential if you plan on having a drink because I don't think they have a wait staff.  We ordered a beer and engaged the bartender in conversation requesting some tips for a couple of rookies on how it works.  She explained the bar is separate as are all the restaurants.  You can stand in the line of your restaurants choice, order and they will either text you when your food is ready, or in my case, bring it directly to me since I was in eyesight of the cashier.

I looked and chose Carota Café, my husband chose another restaurant.  Now what I really wanted was sold out.  SOLD OUT?!  It was about 11 am, they had only been opened an hour and already out of a dish.  I was a little disappointed having gotten worked up to wanting the Eggs and Kale.  I decided to stay with the restaurant and I ordered Herb Baked Eggs, this came with two eggs baked in cast iron skillet, chimichurri, roasted carrot, radish & kale, whole wheat sourdough toast for $12.00.  

We walked back to the bar to await our food which came out relatively quick.  As previously stated mine was hand delivered.   Now my \"newbieness\" really showed through when I was like can I have some silverware?  Sure you can, get up and go get it at a communal table.  Now that I am broke in I totally get it.  This is like an upscale mess hall or cafeteria.  This keeps overhead down, and allows the chefs to concentrate on the important thing, the food.  

I go to take my first bite, and it is piping hot.  Right out of the oven, all is wonderful with the world.  The favors of this dish were strong, maybe a little too much because it was so rich I couldn't finish it all.  It was incredibly tasty what I managed to eat just again very rich and filling.  

To end brunch I ordered an El Coffee, Bourbon, Amaro Averna, and cold brew coffee $11.00.  Yea I spent almost the same amount on my drink as I did my food but this was totally worth it!  Charmingly concocted cocktail.  I love all things coffee and bourbon, so I was sold.  Nice punch there too, just what the doctor ordered.  I can't wait to go back and try this place again.  Great addition to the Pittsburgh Restaurant scene, or should I say 5 great additions, including the bar."}
{"text":"I totally understand the appeal of this place! Great idea of featuring up and coming venues with a variety of menu options. Have visited a couple times and have yet to be disappointed. Finding a seat can be difficult, but the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"A great lunch spot -- order at the counter from four different mini-restaurants which provide a nice variety of food choices. While waiting for your food, choose a beer from the great selection of local beers. Have a seat, grab some silverware, and enjoy your meal. 

Lots of seating available, so this is a great place to bring a group.

Only drawback is that the foods are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for with regards to quality."}
{"text":"Best damn pizza the burgh has ever been blessed me. I'll fight anyone who wants to say otherwise. 

Detroit style za. Thick, crispy exterior, soft fluffy interior topped with some delicious ingredients with a seasonal menu.

 Make sure you check them out for brunch"}
{"text":"Really love this place!  Constantly rotating chefs ensure the offerings never get stale.  And on top of it all, it's where all of the Michigan Wolverines father on Saturday's to watch the game.  Great owners and a fantastic place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and love it. The concept is really good and you can select from the wide variety of food available from different stalls. There is also a bar area as well as Commonplace coffee shop. The only downside is that the rotational menu can hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"I won't bore you with details about how amazing the concept behind Smallman Galley is or about the whole choosing four different restaurants thing. By now you likely already know this. 

This was my first time here and I came for Sunday Brunch. I take brunch very seriously and it's even more important to me on Sunday because it sets the tone for my week. I decided to try the Latin American food from Jesse Barlass' Colonia. I chose the Brazillian which included beans, two fried eggs, and Medium flank steak with chimichurri. I was also able to grab an iced coffee from The Commonplace Coffeehouse next to the bar. 

My meal was fantastic! The flavors complimented each other: the steak was done perfectly and the beans were amazing. I'm hoping I get an opportunity to try some other things on Colonia's menu. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, as well. I'm usually not a huge fan the mess hall or cafeteria seating, but it truly works here."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. We stopped for brunch (10am) on Saturday. I had the pork roast hash from Colonia and my husband had a steak dish (it was delicious - although he couldn't remember the name of it). Savory breakfast usually isn't my jam, but this was amazing. Mike came with roasted yams and an egg on top - perfection! 
The coffee - oh man, the coffee! I had a pour over from Commonplace coffee and it was heavenly. So smooth and full bodied - a perfect compliment to my breakfast! 
There is something for everyone on the brunch menu -
 and Iron Born pizza? Yes please. I sampled their fare at a Yelp event a few months back - and normally I'm not a pizza for brunch person, but exceptions must be made. Their pizza is so crisp, flavorful and just all around amazing. 
The atmosphere at the Galley is fantastic - I do recommend arriving early for brunch if you have a larger party. Seating is first come first serve - and there are high chairs, so families with young children aren't excluded. (We took our 5 month old - he enjoyed looking at the ceiling fans and the neat light fixtures!). 
Whether it's morning, noon or night - stop by the Smallman Galley. They have something sure to appeal to everyone -oh, AND a bar ."}
{"text":"More evidence of the exciting emergence of an amazingly vibrant Pittsburgh restaurant scene. The food was wonderful and it was an exciting dining experience.

We ordered exclusively from Carota Cafe, the food was exclusively farm to table and there were plenty of options for vegetarians. Everything was delicious and imaginative. We ordered, then easily found a table (Saturday night @ 6:30 pm). They buzzed our phone in less than 15 minutes.  Portions were ample (we ordered 4 dishes to split 2 ways), and prices were reasonable ($40 total) and we stuffed ourselves!

We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"At Carota Cafe, I had the Spinach Scramble. It was one of the best breakfast's I've ever. Such outstanding sophisticated flavors lifted my spirits, especially the potatoes. And very reasonably priced for the quality of the food. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I was intrigued when I first heard the concept of this place. For those who don't know, this joint is a cooking experiment of sorts for new or not-as-well-known chefs to get a place to advertise their restaurant concepts with 18-month stints. As such, I decided to go one day and try this place. Currently, there are four restaurants nested within this place: Aubergine Bistro (mixed cuisines), Carota Cafe (veggies-inspired), Josephine's Toast (breakfast-based), and Provision Pgh Food + Drink (meat + global-inspired cuisine). If you're interested in learning more about what each place is about and what their menu lineup is, I suggest you Google Smallman Galley and see what this place is all about. In terms of how it works, just like going to any other restaurant. You pick a certain one (or however many you like to try), order and pay at the register. The eating area is cafeteria-style that is located in the back past the four restaurant concepts. If you're eating in, I believe they bring your food to you when it's ready. In general, you can't really go wrong with any of these places and it's a great way to support those who are up and coming in the food scene. Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've tried each of the four chefs that are in rotation (as of 5/11/16) at least twice now.  Each was delicious, wish they had some lighter beer choices but the mixed drinks are good.

I've never had any complaints but some of the dishes were certainly better than others.  But that's the point isn't it!  I'd recommend going a couple of times to get the full experience for sure.  You're bound to find something you like.  I'd rate the current offerings (1st being my favorite) as follows:

Toast
Aubergine
Carota Cafe
Provision

Don't let the list fool you though, try them all."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with the full intent of going back for more, once for a Yelp event on their second official day of operation, and for their NYE's party. Both parties were good. The concept is unique and fantastic, a great way to expose new chefs to the area [more visa a versa] or tide your 18 months while you prep to have you own larger space. 

I love the exposed brick and long communal tables that are on both ends of the space. There are two main entrances and an additional set of doors by the bar area, which i assume to open up when it starts to get warm again later this year. There are a few tables that are tucked away in the corner that are a little hard to get to, but it's new and they may still play with the set-up. My favorite part is that they have a few seats that dangle from the bar area into the long connector pass where you can look over the different incubator spaces.

A really neat features that I like of the different spaces, other than the exciting menu concepts, is that they text you the wait time and when your food is ready. This way, you have some opportunity to either grab a table to get a drink at the bar and be efficient with your time. 

The bar itself is sleek and neat, primarily stocked with different local and countrywide microbrews. They definitely have a lot Pittsburgh name brands which is exciting. 

A few things are a little bit frustrating but they do the best they can. In our case we were dealing with full houses, so this will probably not always be the case on a normal night, but people are pushed around trying to get back and forth between standing in line for beer, to getting your food, to getting to your table and getting to the restrooms. It can get a little cramped and there is a curb and a ramp, so watch your step. 

Also, there is no way to check into the individual incubator spaces to give individual feedback and I feel awkward giving it here to reflect the space itself. However, I will.

I have tried two of the current restaurants, Carota Cafe and Provision Pgh. A quick highlight of both:

At Carota I have tried the Carrot soup which was delicious and I practically drank it rather than spooning. I enjoyed the texture, which was very good and creamy [without cream of course]. The Octopus was amazing, I am impressed at her ability to sear it so well give such a small space, paired very well with the collard chimichurri. 

We also tried the horseradish gnocchi with black pepper ricotta and hen of the wood. [I love mushroom] However, The gnocchi were too sweet and unimpressive and holy crap on the horseradish pepper ricotta. It sneaks up on you, but your mouth then is burning, and not in a good way. I was perplexed, because the other dish was so good! I suspect it was made in advance to easily smear when needed, and the pepper intensified by the time 8 o'clock rolled around.

At Provision I had a hit and miss experience. The Burger is OUT OF THIS WORLD, delicious. We ordered it medium but it definitely came out medium rare. I personally like it medium rare but my friend got it. Neither of us were disappointed. The Umami Aioli is fantastic and the greens give it a good bite where it mingles with the smoked mushroom. [Jesus, I love mushrooms]. Also the burger is topped with sesame seed which is a nice twist and delicious. The fries are fantastic, but only the side of fries. They are perfectly crispy and the aioli you get to dip it in is awesome [it's a peanutty aioli]. Delish!

Now, going downhill, the Bahn Mi, while delicious on it's self has too much bread overshadowing it. I eventually made it open faced on my own and enjoyed it more. The side of greens was a flop for me. While delicious on the burger, it's has a pungent, bitter taste to the salad dressing and the raw potato slices in it make it even more so. No Bueno. The smothered fries were a mixed bag. Starting with those awesome fries from before, the lentils are good but there are way too many of them, the goat cheese again is excellent, but the squash at the bottom was practically chilly. So when you went from top to bottom it went from hot to cold and ruined the dish, mushing up the texture of the fries and making us leave it mostly standing. A shame.

As said before I will definitely be back for the other two and to try some more dishes from the first two. I'm so happy this space exist in the city."}
{"text":"Rating for their drinks only.

Great place to grab some drinks- cocktails, wine, liquor, or beer! They got it all. I was so happy to see that their beer selection is mainly just local brews. It's awesome. I was able to enjoy some Brew Gentleman brews here and was just delighted. My friend had a few cocktails and loved them. It's cozy here and the vibe is really cool. We had a great time and I'm looking forward to coming back here to eat sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent variety and a super cool concept!  I will say on a Friday night it gets super packed and there isn't a ton of seating, but it's well-worth checking out.  I tried something from all the concepts and each one was awesome - I would have to agree with many others that the squash grilled cheese is epic.  Really nice beer selection as well.  Very much recommended."}
{"text":"These guys not only have a great idea, but they are killing the execution of it. Bring in inspired and talented chefs, give them free reign of their menus and the cocktail list, build out a space that encourages community (and food envy), and let the people support the chefs and act as their guinea pigs so the chefs can hone their concept.  

A few notes: 
 -Happy Hour is half off, so cocktails are $5 and local craft beer is ~$3.50.
 -There are no servers, each stand texts you when your food is ready. As a result if you come with a group expect everyone to be popping up and down. Not a big deal, it actually gives the venue a lot of energy with everyone moving around. 
 
After trying something from each chef I can recommend a few standouts:
 - Green Chile Chicken Tostadas from Provisions (a great combo of spicy, crunchy, sour, and savory)
 - Grits with Kale, Carrots, and Parsnips from Aubourgine (Honestly, this is current leader for \"Best Thing I've Eaten in 2016\". Who knew carrots and parsnips could taste so good?!)
 - Avocado Toast from Josephine's Toast (they offer gluten free toast so if that's your thing don't miss this place)"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed myself every time I've come here. I love the ease, variety, and atmosphere. The food is always different but tasty. Great place for an adventure. Places like this are more common in other cities and I'm glad one has started up in my home town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the city. It is such a unique style for a restaurant that I love to bring friends from out of town to.  The only way I have been able to describe this to other people is as a cafeteria but I don't think that does it justice.  Out of the current set of emerging restaurants, I think that Iron Born is my personal favorite.  Pittsburgh has an okay pizza scene and I have yet to find a local place I really enjoy going to (after 3 years of living here). However, among all that Iron Born seems to be a beacon of hope.  It is my favorite pizza in the city."}
{"text":"Great place, crowded. I ate from the last place on the end. The fish sandwich was excellent. The fries were all crispy fried, to much for me. Then we had a drink, the sangria is sour grape fruit flavored. Good bartender."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Great concept of starter locations for small businesses. The major issue we had was deciding which place to buy from and what to get! The variety was amazing - and since Marty's has closed we were very pleased to see a nice breakfast / brunch spot available with seating options in the Strip!

The mimosas were lovely, although the bar staff was not as attentive as I (or many of the other patrons) would have liked.

All in all -- I'll definitely go back, mostly to see who's setting up shop and what delicious food they are offering!"}
{"text":"If you are from NYC and is kind of a food snob, avoid this place. It only has the LOOK of a good Brooklyn hipster restaurant, without the actual food quality. 
My friend and I went there around 12pm and already a lot of items on different restaurants were sold-out. I had the mushroom pizza with extra salami and it was horrendous: the so-called pizza is just a thin layer of dried cheese and marinara sauce thrown onto a stale Focaccia. The salami was extremely salty. 
My friend had a skirt steak, and the waitress never asked how he liked his steak so we assumed it'd be medium-well. Turns out it was still raw in the center. The same waitress was also extremely rude and handed him the plate of food while snatching the number tag from his hand when he was still waiting in another line getting drinks."}
{"text":"A fun little food court with a little something for everyone and thankfully nothing chain. The road construction outside of the space is unfortunate as it is almost certain to hurt the business. Though worth the extra time to find parking and navigate the mess."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this concept but hated it in reality. Maybe I'm getting too old to wait in lines to order from what is essentially an indoor food truck, wait in line for drinks at the bar, then have to get my own utensils and bus my own table. And being that close to the kitchen and the food was not sanitary at one of the stalls. 

Food was OK but seriously diminished by the environment. Cafeteria format for gourmet prices. No thanks."}
{"text":"Omg where do I begin. I had been dying to try this super fun dining concept for some time. I had been seeing food courts ( I know there is a better name for it I can't think of right now) in my travels to NYC and couldn't wait for PGH to get one! 

I was lucky to go with an adventurous friend because she pushed me to try dishes from multiple places and I'm so glad she did. I hate to go on and on about what we had because I know the places will be changing up soon, but I would be doing a disservice to 2 of the best dishes I've ever had if I didn't mention them! 

They were the duck confit wings and Buffalo cauliflower! Omg! I literally had a dream about the cauliflower the other night. As someone who loves buffalo flavor, but not the fat and calories that always come with it, I was IN LOVE! And the duck confit wings will haunt my dreams with their perfection!

The moral of the story is this place does not disappoint! No matter who comes in next I know I have lots of YUMMY dishes to look forward to!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They alternate different \"pop up\" style chefs/restaurants so you can always have something new. They have 3-4 different concepts at a time. On my recent visit I has the iron born pizza, which was AMAZING! It's deep dish Sicilian style but with crispy edges...so good. I highly recommend the white pizza with arugula. 

I also had a beets and carrots appetizer/side from one of the other concepts (sorry I can't remember the name). It was fresh, but a little bland. It was a unique twist on vegetables, which I appreciated. It's nice to have veggie options."}
{"text":"Variety of outstanding food served at a reasonable price. It is quite noisy and the service itself (i.e. water etc.) aren't the best, but I give the stars for the food. Best to come with a group and try every bite of different styles."}
{"text":"I'm finally getting around to reviewing this place. I went here early this summer and had a pretty fantastic experience. I think that's the perfect word, eating here is not just eating it's an experience. 

This place is set up with multiple chefs and many cuisines to choose from. We focused on Carota Café. We had yams, gnocchi, and octopus (this was three separate dishes split between the two of us). The gnocchi was the show stopper. I've never had a dish that was married so well. The yams were really filling and yummy. Lastly the octopus was good but very small. 

I highly suggest coming here and watching the open kitchen bustle. It's really a site to see."}
{"text":"I really like the Galley's atmosphere. For this and the concept I am giving 4 stars. The food I had was maybe 3-star. We had iron born pizza and it was good enough, but I'm not sure it was worth the $20 price tag for the maybe 5x7 size pizza you get. I know the ingredients are quality and the pizza is thick, so I guess it just isn't for me. It reminded me of a slightly upgraded Pizza Hut pan pizza. I know that sounds horrible, but I guess I don't have that advanced of a palette for pizzas. I'd love to come back and try the other menus though."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch! The gallery collections are awesome with the 3 different restaurants. I love this one because they also have the common place coffee inside."}
{"text":"The previous review explained the concept.  There were three of us when we visited and we each ordered from a different spot.  They were all great.  It's a something different in the Strip.  The evening we were there was quiet and relaxing."}
{"text":"I cannot day enough about this place amazing all around. Iron born pizza left me drooling. Crispy, cheesy and savory. Burnoise was out of this world! I got the bread and butter with honey ( actually I got 2 servings) was amazing and fresh, I've never had anything like it. They crispy chicken sandwich was delicious and real and fresh. Everything you needed it to be. Colonia was great but I've had better pupusas unfortunately. I'm planning on going back tomorrow cause I wanted to try more. Can't say enough go experience the food adventure that is Smallman Gally. Seating was super sparse but other than that it's a must do"}
{"text":"What a great concept!  I came here for brunch with my husband and a couple friends from out of town.  We got here around 1030 on Sunday and they weren't too busy at all.  We tried food from all four of the vendors, and everything we ate was great.  Wonderful attention to detail, and chefs who are happy to talk to you about their food.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just loved the whole experience. Ordering is simple and convenient. The decor is hip and comfortable. We had Pork Belly Grilled Cheese, which was probably my favorite. We also had Garlic Potato Skins, YUM! And we had Keilbasa Fried Rice, which was sweeter than expected but a good combo with the saltiness of the keilbasa. If you want to go during a quieter time, choose Friday afternoon after lunch but before dinner. It's so chill."}
{"text":"Love the concept and love the food. Had a chicken skin sandwich that was amazing. The beer selection is on point and the bar staff was very talkative and knowledgeable about the beer on tap."}
{"text":"A different concept that host 4 different kitchens. I had the wedding bowl with pork. So many different flavors.

Although it was a different concept with different types of food to try it would help I they had paper menus as well as written. There were water bottles on the table but I don't know who the last person was at my table so I got my water from the bar. Overall I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I like the concept - you can go there and take whatever you want. It is nice. However, the food is ok but nothing to write home about. For this price range, I would rather go to root 174 or legume."}
{"text":"This is such a great concept! Today I tried the Hot Mess from Provision. Amazing food. The coffee bar was great (I drink boring black coffee but so good). And the staff was amazing. 

I'm looking forward to trying the other spots and the drinks at the bar (impressive menu). I can't imagine that my opinion will change from the other spots."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley is one of those places that I was so excited to try because of the variety of food you can get. However, the food both my boyfriend and I got was greasy and while the ingredients were all appealing and tasted okay, I couldn't get over the slight burnt grease taste all over. Apparently they were about to start a massive overhaul of the place right after we visited, so I won't mention specific businesses, but the whole experience left a lot to be desired. We struggled to find a place to sit, it took about 15 mins for me to get the bartender's attention for a beer and I left feeling and smelling greasy. Hopefully the place gets better with the remodel!"}
{"text":"A really cool concept! There are 4 restaurants under one roof. The owner of the whole place owns the bar with there are 4 other restaurants located inside. Each of these places are trying out new things to see if they could be successful one their own. They try new things and listen to the feedback from the customers and change on the fly. Each place is allowed to stay for a year and a half and then after they 4 new places come in. You have to pay separately at each place as they are all officially different businesses.

The food, amazing! There are so many different and interesting things to try. This is not a place to go if you are looking for something run of the mill, no sir. Yum! As for the bar they had a large selection of craft beer on tap as well as a fully stocked bar.

I for sure want to go back already!"}
{"text":"Love the concept behind Smallman Gallery, lots of talented local cooks creating a wide variety of brunch options at a reasonable price. We stopped into two of the local shops and got a egg & tomato based scramble and a brie and mushroom omelette, both of which were excellent. Will definitely be back again to try out more!"}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Smallman Galley and we will certainly be returning. 
This evening we tried Iron Born   Chef Pete's pizza concept should take every single Pittsburgher out of their stereo typical local pizza joint habits into an amazingly delightful crispy, airy heaven. 

The white pizza was absolutely fantastic.  Garlic Cream - Caramelized Onions, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula, Whipped Ricotta were so perfectly matched with this unbelievable crust. 

The garlic chili wings are large and packed the perfect amount of heat. 

We had the unique opportunity to sit at the high top counter facing the other restaurants.  Directly next to one of the cooks from another restaurant in the Galley.  His excitement talking about his chef at BRUNOISE made us excited to return and try Chef Ryan's creations. 

We enjoyed our meal, chatting with the cooks and people watching. The bar sever fantastic beer selections in addition to drink choices that compliment the menus of the restaurants. 

I highly recommend a visit to Smallman Galley.  They are open early on the weekends and I hear they each have an amazing brunch menu."}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this town! What a great idea! Get a few start up restaurants that don't have their own place, and put them all under one roof!!
If you find yourself I the strip, you have to stop in and see what they are doing in here. Today there were four food stations to choose from, all very cool and ranged from breakfast/ brunch items to burgers and a Thai station. So you check out the different chefs offerings, place your order, grab a seat in the open area or near the bar, and they txt you when your food is ready! Serious cool vibe in here!
We tried Josephine's toast since it was around brunch time, I had the roasted pineapple and cottage cheese toast and my wife had the smashed avacado with flax seed toast! Brilliant idea, just enough for a mid day snack
The bar had over 20 different drafts to choose from plus wine and mixed drinks.
This is a concept that I could see becoming a regular thing."}
{"text":"Amazing. So much variety and everything is so delicious. My wife and I spend the first twenty minutes of each visit just picking what we want to eat! The choice is difficult because of how delicious everything is!"}
{"text":"Cute lunch spot with a choice for everyone.  Went for the Bahn Mi sandwich with the side of bone broth and it hit the spot just right!"}
{"text":"First off I must say hats off to the owners of Smallman Galley! What a genius concept for a restaurant!
I've eaten at Smallman Galley twice now and totally love this place. The atmosphere & restaurant decor is spot on. 
I ordered food from 3 of the different restaurants within Smallman Galley and I was completely pleased with everything I ordered. I can't really choose a favorite one because all their food is so different from each other. 
But I will say I think my favorite dish is the cottage cheese toast from Toast. 
Each restaurant had a very creative and unique menu. Their food presentation was done very well and thought out. Any one of these restaurants will do just fine with their own brick and mortar location. 
With 4 different restaurants Smallman Galley will definitely have something for everybody. And excited to see what 4 new restaurants go in next."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. The atmosphere was great, service was friendly and quick, and water room temp on the tables with glasses everywhere. Menus hard to read on wall above each food station, so have to walk around and figure out what you want. Descriptions weren't complete. My cousin ordered cheese bread which ended up being three small rolls with a sweet sauce similar to dulce de leche, not at all what she expected. I ordered the Mojo Pork sandwich which came with a side of potato salad. The potato salad was seasoned well and had a great flavor, it did have to much sauce though. The sandwich bread was excellent crisp and chewy. The ingredients were bland. The pork tasted like there was no salt and watery/mushy. If I go back, I will be skippy this station in the Galley."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's been a go-to brunch spot on a number of occasions as it can always accommodate eaters of various types (myself being plants-only, my boyfriend not so much, out of towners anywhere in between).  The concept is great and the only downside is saying goodbye to the stellar first round of chefs to make way for the next class."}
{"text":"A completely brilliant concept. There are so many options, and they're all fantastic. The aesthetic is cool, open and airy with options for communal or private seating. The bar has great options and the drinks are interesting. Go during happy hour to get really great drink specials."}
{"text":"All of the chefs are amazing but Iron Born Pizza is my go-to. The tacos at Bahnmilicious are also to die for, and you can't leave without trying brunoise macarons! Such a great option for families with little ones."}
{"text":"This incubator is full of delicious options, and its location makes it a perfect start or finish to an afternoon in the strip. The current rotation(time of last visit early May) is outstanding with Iron Born Besong the run away winner. I've eaten almost everything on all of the menus, and each meal has been a treat and most have added a subtle twist on classics. I hear they are staggering future rotations to prevent massive shell shock to patrons which I think is a great idea."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a visit with family in Pittsburg. Concept is unique and that's what I liked about it! Food was tasty  I highly suggest stopping in!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in the area. It's such a great idea. And the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"What a genius idea. There are 4 \"restaurants\" to choose from and the dining is chic cafeteria style. Not like normal cafeteria but like a high school movie dining hall where you think, \"NO high school looks like that!\" Well this place looks like that! 

The food was delicious and we ate at Provisions and the chef was amazing! I love being able to meet a chef who is so proud of his food! I had a burger and he said that he donates $1 for every burger sold on certain days (I can't remember, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I think) to a local food bank! 

I cannot wait to go back and get drinks and more food! I would recommend going to the Smallman Galley's twitter or website before you venture out. We were planning on going to dinner tonight there, however they are hosting a private event and it will be closed. Don't worry! It didn't discourage my voting scale! lol"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Smallman Galley yet!   Overall, I love this concept and have been back at least a few times.  I love the variety that you get from the 4 different choices and like that they are now rotating them on differing schedules to keep it a little more stable.  The bar service is generally good and although they could stand for some better Happy Hour specials, I do enjoy drinking there.  

Minus one star for comfort.  I prefer the bar in front of the food vendors for convenience and atmosphere, but having all of those ovens there can make it hard to control the temperature around the bar.  The last time we went, we were miserably hot and sweaty.  The other dining area was cooler, but it was missing the bar atmosphere that we really wanted."}
{"text":"Great addition to the city and the Strip District. Unique environment with multiple chefs to choose from. Food is delicious, environment is great. The bar has fun cocktails. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We hosted an event here. The food was fantastic and I loved the local beers on tap. This is a fantastic, modern restaurant, with a good mission! I can't wait to go back to eat off the menu."}
{"text":"Best place in town for happy hour specials. I love their cocktails and the venue is large enough for big groups."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I think the little cafeteria idea is super cute. All the food is really good, but I think the breakfast food beats their lunch food. I feel like they do average and adventurous breakfast foods very well. 

Sometimes, the menus are a little vague though and hard to figure out what you're trying to order. It also gets super busy and can sometimes be hard to find a table...but it's not nearly as busy as some of the other diners around."}
{"text":"Literally incredible. I cannot even describe everything we ate and experienced here. Burgers, Patty Melts, salads, smoked yams... order something from each place and plan to share."}
{"text":"Very cool place! First time here, will return. It is a group of small restaurants where the chefs can try out their creations. It is in an old warehouse with cafeteria style seating. Order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. The downsides being you have to go to one place for your entree, another for your coffee, and a third for your Bloody Mary. And pay separately. The other thing is if you order from different places from your companions the food will come out at different times and you may find yourself drooling while they eat!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place since it opened! It was definitely worth the wait. In this \"cafeteria\" of deliciousness, I settled on the bleu burger from Provision. It was cooked to perfection. The French fries were equally as delicious.

My loan complaint about SG was that in the bar, it gets too crowded. There isn't enough space between the bar and the first row of high tops so if you find yourself standing behind someone at the bar, you'll constantly find yourself in the way. A small issue for a great location!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh! I love the concept and the atmosphere of this place. I always take friends and family whenever they visit. The first time we came we went to all 4 restaurants and ordered something from each. I was not disappointed. It's a great place to go when you're not sure what you want to eat and have a group of people. That way everyone has an option! I probably frequent this place way too often if that's such a thing haha"}
{"text":"The idea is cool and so is the space. Unfortunately I had a bad experience with Carota Cafe. The kale and egg was totally gross - I love kale and literally couldn't eat it - it was burnt and covered in parsley (a weird choice of seasoning in my opinion). I hardly ever complain but I was still hungry, so went to tell the cashier and asked if there was something else I could have instead. She apologized but was generally unconcerned and then tried to charge me for the $5 side dish she'd suggested! Damn. I probably won't say anything next time I hate something but I also won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating and no wait makes Smallman Galley an ideal destination for Sunday brunch.  I guess my SO and I were in a comfort food mood with the snow falling outside, as we shared the PORK BELLY RAMEN from Aubergine Bistro and LAMB STEW from Carota Cafe.  The stew was brought to our table immediately, with the ramen following perhaps 15 minutes or so later.  We also grabbed an Americano and a Gryphon's Masala Chai tea from the coffee bar.

I'm generally a sucker for hole-in-the-wall type \"ethnic\" eateries, so it's been a while since I've treated myself to some upscale American bistro cooking, and the punch of flavors in the lamb stew fully reminded me of what I had been missing.  The rich dill-scented broth reminded me of a lovely Eastern European shchi soup (an herby sauerkraut beef broth-based soup), so aromatic and just pungent enough without being overbearing.  The lamb meat fell into toothsome strings in the soup, and the root vegetables were soft without being mushy.  The bowl came topped with a piece of garlic bread that my SO used as a vehicle for the lamby goodness into his mouth as we shared the bowl in the center of the table.  I can't muster up a single criticism for this dish.  It was absolutely lovely.

Then the ramen arrived, fragrantly wafting us with sesame oil and dressed to impress with no shortage of sliced fresh shiitake mushroom, scallions, shredded wakame, a soft-boiled egg (not too hard but not too liquidy to spill into the broth), and the sumptuous pork belly.  While each component had clearly been carefully prepped, I wished that the ingredients and the broth had just a bit more seasoning--granted, though, I tend to be a fan of very big tastes.  Mild is not my style, and that's what this broth was, as I tasted mostly the sesame and little of the pork and its fatty goodness.  The abundant belly that we kept finding large chunks of in our bowl was a beautifully soft texture, though sadly wanted for a bit more salt as well.  My fiance devoured the thin, curly noodles. While not the best ramen I've ever had, this bowl did not disappoint me, as the deliberation and care put into its composition clearly came through in taste and delivery.

It was obvious to me from my visit why Smallman Galley has been so popular in Pittsburgh--the dishes are prepared with the detail and skill of a fine dining establishment, while the vibes and prices are easy-going and non-committal.  The cafeteria-style seating and the self-service utensils are the perfect complement to the progressive menus.  These chefs deserve so much respect for growing and adapting their businesses in these tiny kitchens, but what a great opportunity it is for Pittsburgh to see and taste what they're made of.  Don't miss this."}
{"text":"Got to have a sneak peek of this place, but I wanted to wait until I could come back and assess pricing on my own to actually write my review.

I love the concept, and the food is executed superbly. I feel like the space might need some work, however. It is really hard to find a table, and it is not at all obvious how best to queue up for food.

Given the latest trends in food, it can actually be really hard to find good (read: non-pasta) veg food at hip new American restaurants. Not so with the current crowd at Smallman Galley.

My top single food item is the Provision fries. They come with lentils, a lemon aioli, goat cheese and pickled shallots. They are so good. Even the plain fries are delicious!

My favorite restaurant overall is (obviously) Carota, which has many lovely veg options. My current favorite is the squash grilled cheese (manchego + squash + pesto on seedy bread - yum!)

The prices are great in light of the portion size and overall quality. I am very pleased in this regard.

A note: while these 4 chefs will be around for another year or so, they do change their menus (a lot of them are focused on seasonal ingredients) so check back often!"}
{"text":"If you can snag the seats, this place is a great group spot for brunch. We were here with a group of like 15 people and were able to grab a long table that seated all of us. Perfect!

I've been to a food hall or two in my day, but this place is cooler. Emerging restauranteurs get to test out their recipes and restaurant concepts with eager crowds who want to try new things. There are also bars and a coffee station, because brunch! 

The current restaurant-ettes are:
-Colonia (Latin American food)
-Brunoise (progressive American cuisine)
-Iron Born (pizza). I tried a bite of the brunch pie (Sausage - Shaved Fingerling Potato - Cheddar Cheese - Maple Drizzle) and immediately declared this the winner of brunch. Not just this brunch, but all brunches everywhere.
-Bahnmilicious (Vietnamese food). This is the place I ordered my brunch dish from. I had the Jasmine rice and Chinese sausage (fried egg, cucumber, picked vegetables, and sweet sauce.) The whole thing was SO good, but the deliciously sweet sausage was hands down the star. The fresh veggies and rice in (what tasted to me like a fish sauce) were great as well. I also had an iced vietnamese coffee, which was good but perhaps a little too sweet, even for a drink that's supposed to be sweet."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's PhD defense after party. I had the chicken bbq sandwich from Josephine's. I came here with super high expectations, and the sandwich almost lived up to them. 

The ambience and decor was really nice."}
{"text":"Fabulous! I went to the elite event at Smallman Galley a few months ago whenever they first opened. For whatever reason, I never made it back despite how awesome the event/food/owners were. 

My friends wanted to do brunch and noticed a delicious chicken and waffle picture on IG. They suggested Smallman Galley and i wasnt about to say no. 

Unfortunately, Aubergine's Chicken and Waffles were a limited time deal. They were sold out whenever we arrived at 2:15. (Brunch is only until 3pm Sundays). 

We all decided to order from Josephine's Toast. I went with the Smashed Avocado Toast  ($6) and added an egg ($2). I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes ($5) and a flower petal tea. I loved my toast. Im a huge fan of avocado and this was the perfect brunch for me. You are able to order the egg however.. i went with over easy.

My friends ordered a mix of things and we all sampled each other's dishes. I believe one of my friends ordered the build your own toast option with bacon butter & rasberry preservatives. She also ordered their local yogurt with fresh granola and berries (loved!). Another friend ordered the Roasted Pineapple & Cottage Cheese Toast which was amazing and refreshing. 

Everything that I sampled here (Josephine's Toast) tasted so fresh (probably the most fresh food ive had while eating out) and delicious. I'm excited to head back to Smallman Galley and sample other chef's items, maybe even for dinner next time. 

I love this idea and what Smallman Galley is doing. Go support these chefs. It's cool to be apart of this."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and encountered super friendly people and some local Pittsburgh celebs ;) i learned about Leonas and the best ice cream sandwich in town. I ordered a duck omelette and got a Cortado from the coffee bar which never disappoints me. Definitely stop by - it's a comfortable and inviting space with smiling faces! I'll definitely be back for more noms and out to find some Leonas!"}
{"text":"They have four restaurants and a bar in one space. You pay separately at each one and find your own table and seat. The cashier said that they would text me when my food was ready to pick up. I received a phone call from Phoenix, Arizona instead, about which I was confused and thought maybe it was a telemarketer. I ordered the Hot Mess (tortilla, chili chicken, onion, goat cheese, and fried egg) from Provision. I did not taste any chili or cheese. My friend who ordered from one of the other restaurants also thought that his food tasted a bit bland. I liked the interior design."}
{"text":"Alright...this is a bit of a mixed bag review-wise...not because there is some good and bad, but because...well...read the review.

It was my birthday...or a few days later.  A friend and I were celebrating.  Smallman Galley was on my \"list\" to try.  I didn't know what to expect.  But I think I had in my mind a vision of what this \"chef incubator\" was going to be.  

Things I didn't expect:  picnic table seating, 4 \"store fronts\", people lined up ordering from the counter.  So...go into it with that expectation.  I kind of love the idea of the place, but if you were thinking to woo your lady love (or man love, whatevs) with a candle-lit dinner in a cozy restaurant with amazing service...well, you'd  miss the mark.

I had to wait.  My friend was late.  I was sitting at the bar, so I didn't really care.  I perused the menu.  First drink that popped out at me was a Primus song.  \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\" reportedly had:  Amara Sfumato Rabarbaro, Aperol, Genepy des Alpes, pluot syrup, and La Croix.  

First impressions:  I don't know what any of those things are.  Not one.  Hadn't heard of them.  Hadn't had them.  Didn't know how to pronounce them.  The only word I recognized was \"syrup\".  I vaguely recalled 'des' might have meant \"of\" in friench.  Or Belgian.  Whatever.  Completely incomprehensible drink while you wait for a friend?  TAKE ALL MY MONEY!

It was really good.  Served in a tall glass with a lemon garnish, I sat and drank my fancy unpronouncably ingrediented drink in suave sophistication.

I texted a picture to my friend.  \"You're there already?\"  Yeah...because that's when we said we'd meet.  

Whatever.  I finished that drink and went two lines up on the drink menu.  \"Vilified\"  This promised brown butter-washed bourbon, sage-sweet potato syrup, and black walnut bitters.  So much effort went into this drink.  Who do they get to wash the bourbon in brown butter?  How many natives died making the sage-sweet potato syrup?  And I don't even know how you make a bitter let alone a black walnut bitter.  This drink was described so pretentiously I had to lie to the bartender and tell him my name was Thurston J. Howell before he'd pour it for me.  It was great.  I would have had another.  Wait...I did have another.  I think.  Things were starting to get a little...hazy.  It had an orange garnish.  It didn't photograph well. 

I texted a picture of vilified to my friend.  \"What?  You're on your second drink?\"  I was.  \"You're going to be hammered by the time I get there.\"  I was.

Whatever.  I finished that drink and and moved on to \"Cyco Vision\".  Redemption rye, Yellow Chartreuse, pistachio orgeat, lemon, cardamom bitters, egg white.  And listen...I'm a sucker for egg whites in my drink.  I can't explain why.  Rye?  Awesome.  Yellow Chartreuse?  Confusing.  Orgeat?  Let's be honest.  When I got to orgeat it sounded like orgy and I might have chuckled to myself and just ordered the drink because of the orgeat.  I don't even know what orgeat is.  But...it also reminded me of Xergiok from Adventure Time.  I had to have this drink.  

I had this drink.  It was good.  It was honestly my least favorite of the three but it was good.  I took a picture...it looked like a malt.  Served in a wide goblet, It had a thick foam on top and the bartender drew a little design with ...maybe with the orgeat...I don't know.  Fancy!  

I texted my friend the picture.  \"Jesus, I'm almost there, slow down!\"  I did.  

And then my friend arrived and I recommended the Vilified and she hated it, so I drank hers and she took the \"Superman\" that I ordered, which was good, but I wasn't in love with it.  

And then the bartender accidentally made someone another drink and it wasn't what he ordered and so she was going to dump it, but I said, \"What do you do with a drink when it's the wrong one?\" and she said, \"Dump it, unless you want it.\"  I did.  I don't even know what it was.  I think it was good. It's not completely clear.

And so now...Well now I've had five or six drinks in an hour and a half and I'm pretty much open for business, but it's time to eat, because god forbid we drink on an empty stomach.  TOO LATE!! IT WAS TOO LATE!!  But I walked past the previously-mentioned store fronts on my way to the bathroom and brought back a few ideas...

We ended up eating shrimp and grits (fairly certain this was delicious, but I have no idea which place I got it from) and poutine (again...and again).

So...I guess the mixed bag is that 1)  I really don't have a clear memory of the food.  I know it was good.  I just don't know where I got it, but 2) I have a very strong sense of the drink menu.  And it was a good drink menu.  

Go for drinks!

I will be back.  What I remember of the food was that it was really good.  I know what to expect (no waitress, first come first serve seating, picnic table style).  Outstanding place to go with a group of friends and just sort of sprawl out across a picnic table and drink and try new foods."}
{"text":"We loved the food hall dining style and ordered items from almost every restaurant in the building to make our meal. Food was creative, tasty and served with care. I appreciated the small concentrated menus, as I felt that all vendors focused on their specialities."}
{"text":"The food selection is pretty great and the bar team does a good job. But since no one else seems to be mentioning it, let me say that the space is too small, cramped, and generally unorganized for the crowd sizes they get. I've been in there 3 or 4 times and it's always been busy, which is great, except for when it's time to get your seats. If you come as just 2 people, it's pretty easy to find some spare seats, but groups of 4+? Good luck. I've had people standing over me waiting for my seats while finishing my food, tapping their toes. I've seen people have \"disagreements\" over who reserved what seats when. I've even been that person, waiting in the corner hoping some seats might open up before my food arrives. All in all, it's uncomfortable that all customers are essentially \"self policing\" in a place that gets absolutely packed. It really verges on totally inhospitable. I don't blame the chefs for this issue -- they're just trying to make the best food they can. But since the space can't magically expand its footprint, the managers/owners should try to find a better way to crowd-control, whether it be staff who controls seating patterns, to some sort of better waiting area, or even keeping people lined up outside until there is room indoors. I know that's a lot of work, but the crazy scene is so unpleasant that it makes it seem more appealing to go somewhere lesser in quality, but better in service and seating."}
{"text":"I visited Smallman Galley a few weeks back with some colleagues for a casual dinner.  I'd been wanting to check it out anyway, so when I saw that it was our destination, it made me all the more eager to go.

We started off by ordering some drinks from the bar, given that we visited during happy hour.  All of the drinks are half off during HH, affording a great opportunity to try them at cut rate.  My drink was a whimsically named one called something like \"You're the DJ, I'm the rhythm\" ($5) that was pomegranate flavored and vodka based, and it went down real smooth.  The bartender mentioned after the fact that the cocktails were created to pair with the offerings from each of the eateries, but even though mine wasn't paired with any of the eateries I chose, I thought it went well with the food that I ordered anyway.

Each of us ordered an appetizer and an entree and we shared them, so we each were able to try a bit of all of our selections.  For my appetizer, I went with the Provision fries ($8) based on the recommendation of several other Yelpers, and for my entree, I went with the pork chop with kale over grits from Aubergine ($17) based on a colleague's recommendation.  While chops aren't my favorite form of pork (I'm a pulled pork girl all the way!), Aubergine's version wasn't half bad.  It did have the chewy texture that I'm not a huge fan of, but it had a nice flavor that was complemented well by the kale and grits.  As for the Provision fries, they were as delicious as other Yelpers made them out to be.  In particular, I enjoyed the variation in texture lent by the components of the dish, which was reminiscent of poutine but a major step up in terms of culinary sophistication.

In addition to my selections, I tried the cheese and toast plate from Josephine's Toast, the roasted beets from Carota Cafe, and the chicken confit (not sure where this one was from).  Of these, the cheese plate was my favorite--it came with several varieties of local cheeses and, of course, miniature toasts.  The roasted beets had a nice firm texture and an earthy flavor, as is appropriate for this dish.  Likewise, the chicken confit had the characteristic smooth consistency and savory flavor of this dish, and was accompanied by a hard boiled egg and pickled veggies, as well as bread for dipping purposes.  The only dish that we ordered that wasn't up to snuff was the kale salad (not pictured), which was rather disappointingly bland.

Given that other reviewers have explained how ordering works, I won't rehash it.  However, I will mention that, aside from its efficiency, another advantage of the system is that it permits ordering items from multiple vendors with ease.  One thing that hasn't been mentioned outright in previous reviews that we found rather amusingly disconcerting are the huge holes in the reclaimed wood planks composing the tops of the tables.  These holes are amazingly conducive to spilling food onto one's legs/the chair/the floor (at least, for a klutz such as me!), so I advise caution in choosing where to sit and placement of dishes.

Overall, I enjoyed Smallman Galley and would definitely consider returning for brunch.  If I visited alone or with a friend, I probably wouldn't order as much, given that the prices aren't exactly inexpensive.  Nevertheless, going with colleagues gave me the chance to sample items from all of the vendors and get a sense of the offerings, which was great for a first visit.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food gets 5-stars. The wife and I decided to split our orders. We got the Spicy Pie without the meats, and it was incredible. We also got the salad from Town, and the thin cut onions and fried/toasted chunks of cheese enriched the salad enough to make me forget that my wife made us order a salad. It wasn't until we were half way through that it struck us that if both dishes were so good, why not try to combine the 2?!?! Needless to say, the mash-up was a huge success. I think the two spots should collaborate... Oven's spicy pie topped with Town's salad. Epic.

Drinks get 2-stars. Options were good and the bartender who first greeted us was friendly... but from there it went downhill. The other bartender served us the most part there, and she was rude. I first noticed it when she was curt with the party next to us, and further experienced her elitist charm while ordering with her. Tried to make small talk to lighten the mood, and she was not having it. When we left, my wife asked \"what the fck was her problem?!\".... and my wife uses the f-word maybe 5 times a year (4 times are typically towards Trump)."}
{"text":"The idea is really good--it's more or less a small upscale food court, with each restaurant / vendor serving full menus. That means that you have the opportunity to order from several different places and try a variety of things. Although if you're getting full entrees, that might be a bit difficult since they all seem to be pretty big portions!

Coming in past the normal lunch time on a Saturday afternoon, we found that there were not too many customers milling around, so plenty of seating was available. We ordered a pork belly omelette from Aubergine and a power bowl (acai bowl with yogurt) + matcha from Carota. The wait for both was minimal, and both were pretty large (even the power bowl, for only $6). The omelette came with a side salad and the meat was very tender and flavorful. The power bowl had a lot of fresh blueberries and golden berries, as well as sweet granola and goji berries. Finally, the cup of matcha, while a bit on the small side, was a delightfully refreshing blend of almond milk, mint, and matcha powder. This was overall a great combination of entree, dessert, and drink.

The space itself is pretty conducive to the concept, if not a bit awkward. There's a table at the front and some counter seating along the wall, as well as what I assume to be tables for the Galley in the back. I can see how, when it gets crowded, the space would fill up fast and make it hard to order, and it could also get pretty loud. On the other hand, it's an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs at work."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, and value were all great!  Half priced cocktails?  Yes please!  The roasted root vegetables were better than my own, and the burger was delicious. I will definitely return and recommend Smallman Galley to friends.  There are many interesting menu items I want to try.

Service was a little awkward, but other guests helped us figure out how it worked.  It's basically a food court, so I was surprised when the POS system prompted a tip.  I added a 20% tip out of habit but was not sure why or who it was going to.  There is no service except order taking.  I hope my tip found its way to the wonderful, efficient, friendly busser.  Next time we will save our tip and give it directly to the busser."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and the idea of restaurant incubator.  I have had very good food there with lots of options for vegetarian food.  Only drawback, it can get quite busy and hectic on weekends.  I highly recommend the place for a weekday dinner."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Smallman Galley on a Friday around 4:30.  We tried the food from Aubergine.  

I ordered the Pan Seared Spanish mackerel and the Egg Salad.  I liked how inexpensive Mackerel was.  Eating mainly fish, usually when I go out to eat it seems like I'm paying a premium.  Pricing wise it stood along with everything else on the menu.  The fish itself was very well portioned, cooked and seasoned just right: nice and crispy on the outside and just heavenly on the inside.  It was paired with Carolina rice and snap peas.  It reminded me of a dish you could get from a Puerto Rican neighborhood in New York.

The egg salad was really rich and super filling.  I'm also glad that they didn't overdo it with the anchovies.  So that made them a nice touch.  You definitely get a decent portion of egg salad so it's absolutely worth sharing.

We also were lucky enough to come during happy hour which only means one thing...half off drinks! The bar is this beautifully slated bronze and the bartenders and incredible: they really know their stuff and put their time and care into your drink by tasting the larger batch before pouring a glass.

I'm glad we came at the time that we did because the chef said he was expecting it to be incredibly busy tonight."}
{"text":"Update since they tried to delete my original post! This is a legit review as the venue is just as important as the vendors - it's about your ENTIRE meal experience - service and the food.

If you can even get inside to a vendor you might be happy: however we tried 3x and left 2 out of 3!  We tried to get a table at 6:30p on a Saturday night, I took my partner for his birthday, they had a wedding party blocking off 90% of their seating - very obnoxious - especially when I am 9mos pregnant and have to sit. really though, who doesn't want to sit and eat their food?! That's the point, this isn't a to-go joint.

Basically the success of the three tries - you have to go on a weekday just before closing - as we finally did yesterday - a Tuesday night we figured couldn't go wrong. Food is good, but still the service of the staff sucks-  kicking us out of the dining room yet again as we were eating because they were closing it, we were forced to move to the bar stools.

Pizza was good, too much bread - it's like a double Sicilian, it's overwhelming.

All the food vendors were great, and really nice and the food was overall pretty, they try hard to please.

Pupusas are a treat in pittsburgh, haven't seen one since I lived In California - these were modified to be more \"trendy\" but still very good.
That was our fav thing out of the many items we tried.

The venue stinks, hence the 1star review - the vendors are great and pull it up to a 2 star for that alone.

Also watch the hours - yelp posts hours, but there are kitchen hours and bar hours- if you're a late night eater you'll be upset you can't eat in the 2hr window they show the place open!"}
{"text":"Smallman Galley, where have you been all my life?
Love the concept, love the chefs, love the food! I have been to the Smallman Galley on a couple of different occasions now and have been able to try all four of the cafes and I am impressed! All of them are amazing, so amazing and unique that I wouldn't be able to pick a favorite! I first came here on their pre-opening night for a yelp event and even though I have been traveling a lot and seen a lot, I haven't come across a concept like this. 

The atmosphere is unique as well. Kind of industrial, laid back, but always buzzing with people. I love the long tables in the back where it was always fun to meet your neighbors. It's just like having a huge family get together, where most of the times you don't know all your relatives and have to introduce yourself :)

I have had the grilled octopus from Carota Cafe and OMG! Amazing and perfectly grilled. It's so easy to screw up octopus, but this one was tender, full of flavor and the crispy potatoes, the olives and chimichurri perfectly accompanied it. You want meatballs? Try Aubergines lamb and pork meatballs! Who can really say no to Provision fries? And have you tried the blackberry apple toast cake from Josephine's Toast? Divine! 

I haven't tried brunch here yet, but I have had lunch/dinner/happy hour cocktails/coffee and dessert. All of their food is amazing, and once you have ordered you don't actually have to wait and stand around and miss all the fun as they will happily send you a text once the dish is ready at the counter. Their happy hour is quite popular so make sure you get there early! 

Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Hipster bar in Strip District. Lovely decor with copper bar top and edison bulb lights. Quirky cocktail menu. I had the overly sweet Saturday Morning Toons (gin, coconut sake and peynaud bitters)."}
{"text":"a new favorite lunch spot.  I love all of the the choices and ever changing menus.  always very clean and never a long wait!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting and both times I came with large groups. It's cafeteria style with long tables and smaller tables. 

There are several smaller restaurants and a bar located within the space. You order and pay separately at each of them and they will bring your food to you. 

The food is good. Most recently, I had the pork Bah MI sandwich with fries and it was good. A coworker had fresh pasta that was also good. They have artisan burgers, as well as octopus and clams. 

Happy hour at the bar is until 7 pm on Tuesdays through Fridays I believe. It's half off. I got a local Apple cider for $3. 

I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday night, we ordered pizza from iron born! First off the pizza was AMAZING, I ordered the spicy pie and the honey on top was to die for. He ordered the meat pie and raved about it as well.
Also we ordered drinks at the bar and the bartenders were extremely fast and were always ready to take our order (and everyone else's) on a very very busy night. 
Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. My fiancé and I did Provision on our first trip. I had the burger and he had the Bahn Mi. Both were amazing! 
Our second trip was more recent and we tried Josephine's. It was just as good. He has the Roast Beef sandwich and it was very good. I had the shrimp and corn entree.  It was yummy but I do wish the portion was more hearty. 
The bar is awesome and makes this place a hit for us. Local Pittsburgh brews make it a must stop."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and concept, along with excellent food. Our party of four ordered from two different places in addition to the bar. We were all happy with our food. Two of us got the Provision burger and agreed it was the best burger we've had in a long time. Loved the aioli with the fries. Also loved that water was on all of the tables, though we needed a refill. My dish was ready first, and I was almost done by the time the other three got their food (even though my friend ordered the same dish before me). This place is still getting its kinks out, so it can only get better!"}
{"text":"This place needs like 5 separate reviews.  I mean, it's a bar area + 4 chefs, so I really do not know how you share the review along them.  All stores (except the bar) share the same sitting area, so it certainly has college / food court type of feel.

We had a burger with the one furthest inside (enter from 21st St). The burger is certainly 5 stars. It has mushrooms and the sauce was special. One of the best I had in the Burgh. 

We had an octopus salad too (second last store from 21st St?!).  It was \"special-but-ok\" / \"alright, that's interesting\". Not saying it is bad, not at all, more like \"Mmm... O.K.\".  The portion was definitely on the small scale.  

Will be back for the burger, but not sure about the octopus salad.  Did not try the other two places yet, but the seared scallops from 2nd store in looks delicious."}
{"text":"First came for yelp event a few weeks ago, tasted pizza, ginger salad, and risotto TO DIE FOR! My friend and I each took home a white and a red pie, soooo good. Tonight I had the BURGER!!! OMG it was amazing. Been in the mood for a good one, the boyfriend hit up McCormick & Schick's HH without me so I remembered this place. And oh is my belly happy!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant concept! There are so many different food options and all I've tried thus far have been amazing.  Highly recommend for a laid back night out."}
{"text":"Great place for a party. I love the idea of having many chefs with their own stations and menus. 
A full bar gets you ready with that drink to find a table and plan your meal. 
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome concept! I got the provision fries and smoked kielbasa plate. The provision fries were really good with the butternut squash puree. The horseradish gnocchi my aunt got was really good. It also was cool that I got a memberberry blueberry sour beer from grist and it was half off. The brownie with the French fries sounds great."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley is the coolest concept in the city and quickly becoming a favorite spot!You've got 4 choices of \"restaurant\" - which is more similar to a stationary food truck.  Its a stall.  Up-and-coming chefs try their hand at managing their micro restaurant.  I like it because you can have completely different cuisines and options all in the same place!  Just try it!

a few tips:
 ~ not a sit down and be served atmosphere.  its open seating, find a spot and make a friend ~ you order at the stall that you want, get a number, put it on your table, and they'll bring it out
 ~ get your own drinks at the bar, they've got a great list
 ~ someone will bus the table
 ~ its noisy and I love it - adds to the overall atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love the concept of supporting up and coming chefs, and the menus are fun and enticing, but the follow through isn't there. That's ok since these are not experienced restaurateurs, but it does leave you a little disappointed. I just wanted some simple greens and crusty bread this time around and ordered from the Bistro (can't remember the precise name). The salad was fresh but oversalted and the ratio of greens to toppings was way too high. Dressing was simple, clean and tasty. The bread was disappointing. It was advertised and warm baguette with herb butter, but came as toasted, drizzled in olive oil and drowned in salt. I could hardly add the herb butter to that! 

The space is welcoming and appealing, but it's super loud when busy and the music was aggressive and way too loud. Hard to hear my friend talk. Ok I sound like a granny, but it felt more like a bar than a place to eat dinner. Much better on a quiet afternoon when it's slow."}
{"text":"This is the coolest thing EVAH!! A business incubator for restaurants AND a great bar serving craft beers and wine! So far, I have tried several items from two of the four options and loved everything. There is pretty much something here for everyone, from veggie to comfort to fresh fish and flank steak. When you order, you are asked for your cell phone number and receive a text when your order is ready. The seating can be the biggest downside to the Galley. I have enjoyed sitting with others at the large center table or at the bar, but if I get stuck at the railings along the edges, it is not a very comfortable place to eat...reminiscent of a hot dog stand....It can also be difficult to get close enough to the bar to order your delicious craft beer, but persevere, it is worth it! As a newbie to Pittsburgh and living in the Strip, I am having a hard time walking past Smallman Galley to try all of the other restaurants available. I am Hooked!"}
{"text":"The yellow shrimp and grits was different. Not super crazy about it but it wasn't the worst either. I would go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Officially jumping on this hype train. CHOO CHOOOOO

First off, there are so many lures to bring you into this place: the creative concept, the chill ambiance, the half-off happy hour drinks... all good reasons.

Oh, and the food is pretty damn good too. 

From Provision, we got the burger and liver pate, and from Aubergine, the meatballs and smashed potatoes. Presentation was on point, portions and price were reasonable, and flavor was KILLER. 

In addition to the above, I really liked these things too:
- It's FAST! We were on a tighter schedule, and you can easily get in and out in less than an hour without shoveling down your food. It took literally 12 minutes, and I know that because...
- They text you when your food is ready to pick up. What a smart idea. 
- Friendly bar staff!
- Abundant seating, with varying arrangements. When we went, the bar was pretty hopping for happy hour, but you could also have enjoyed a quieter meal on the restaurant side.

So overall, not only a great idea, but it's also executed really well. Definitely hitting Smallman up again at some point."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in here! What a creative concept to have multiple restaurants within one and offer galley style seating. Clever! 

I attended an event here in June to kick off Negroni week. The charity and calendar sales benefitted the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Drinks were refreshing. The food was eclectic and delicious! Servers were friendly and hospitable. I'll look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Really long waits for mediocre food... you're better off eating the street food off penn."}
{"text":"If you are trying to get in, Tuesday at 6 was easy sailing! I'm reading the previous reviews and I didn't have the same experience. I'm going to be short and sweet with this one...
1. The concept is fantastic. 
2. The location is fantastic.
3. The actual space was so loud that we couldn't hear each other speak. 
4. It's not good for dates. The idea that you have to find and save a table means you can't order food with you company. You have to take turns...
5. Cell service wasn't great inside so the text that my food was ready didn't come through.
6. We had the Provisions burger and it didn't have anything significant that stood out other than the amazing description on the board
7. My friends had 2 other dishes that weren't so great

I'm sad to say that I wasn't down."}
{"text":"Great choices for eating...bar was great too!  The food we got was simply spectacular!  We had shrimp with grits...maybe wife had chicken pot pie (to die for sooooo rich and creamy!) and I had the pork belly!  Oh my goodness...we had a hard time finishing it!  Very very delicious and very upscale!  The place was packed but worth any type of wait!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"IMO i think it's a gastronomic gem and highly recommend going there. 
It's highly seasonal and highly creative food and flavors and no need to pay tip like the high end places. 
Definitely coming back for next trip in Piitsburgh."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley is hands down the coolest innovative dining in the Pittsburgh area currently.  4 different restaurants .. AUBERGINE BISTRO,,CAROTA CAFE,, TOAST, AND PROVISION PGH ...AND a full blown bar with craft cocktails.  
There's something for everyone here/... It's very casual.. you walk up and order..then take a seat and they bring your food out to you. My favorite there is:

 Provision Smothered Fries $7 gf/v
English Pea Puree | Lentils | Goat Cheese | Lemon Aioli | Herbs   -unreal taste!!! 

They also have a substantial SUNDAY \"DRUNCH\" MENU... 

Don't miss out on these 4 restaurants as they will be changing sometime in the near future to 4 DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS!!"}
{"text":"Love the concept I only wish there were cocktail servers so you didn't have to get up to get a refill. We got the white and the red pizza from Iron Born and OMG they were both out of this world. I will be back to try the other places but it will be hard to pass up that pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Iron Born pizza is amazing! The spicy pizza is to die for a flavor explosion in every bite! The place itself is fresh and open and lively so much to choose from Alex the manager was very attentive and helpful! Back to the pizza try it you gonna like it it's the bomb! Happy"}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends for brunch on Sunday morning.  We arrived at 10:00 AM when they open on Sundays.  There was plenty of space and tables/chairs for the choosing.  Had the little tike with me so happy to see that they had hi-chairs although their hi-chairs didn't come with the \"seatbelt\" usually included to tie rambunctious babies down like mine so I was hold on to one of his legs to prevent him from climbing on the table (sigh).

But on to the food.  Ordered the avacado toast with egg (scrambled) and Ginger Pear spice treat from Toast.  The flavor/taste of both were great.  I really enjoyed the savoriness and creaminess of the avacodo toast and the ginger pear sweet treat was a nice complement to a savory dish.  My only complaint was that \"toast\" was the foundation for the Ginger/Pear treat which I get but it didn't really work because it made what would have been an uh-mazing dessert a bit dry and flaky.  The bottom portion which was the toast just fell apart and it was difficult to eat with the rest of the dish.  I ended up eating the top portion which was very good - it had a subtle ginger spice taste but I could tase the delciousness of the pears."}
{"text":"A gem in Pittsburgh. Such a wonderfully unique experience, I enjoy myself every time I am there. Whether its brunch, dinner or late night drinks and appetizers, the atmosphere is always bubbly and the food is always good. I have my favorites among the current restaurants, but each one is so unique, there is something here for everyone. I took my parents here from out of town and they were really impressed. The next weekend, I did some serious day drinking and brunch with my bff and had a ball. Great place all around."}
{"text":"Simply put, Smallman Galley is worth the hype.

I first visited on a Saturday night around 7pm, and, of course, it was absolutely packed. It took nearly 10 minutes to order and pay for a beer and the tight space made me feel like I was always in the way no matter where I stood. Even so, I would go back in a heartbeat. I ordered Carota Cafe's Horseradish Gnocchi, which was almost impossibly decadent for a vegetarian dish. The bartenders were busy mixing some seriously tempting cocktails, though I chose Brew Gentlemen Co. and Grist House beers from the wide selection of local breweries.

It was a much different scene on my second visit for a Thursday happy hour. This place should be packed for their half-off drinks from 5-7pm, but it was really slow. Not that I'm complaining! It felt like the perfect place for a laid back drink after work. This time I ordered the Provision fries based on the Yelp reviews, and I was blown away. For drinks, I had the sangria (A+) and Raise the Jolly Lager cocktail, which was too sweet for me.

Like others said, what really sets Smallman Galley apart is the atmosphere. If you like to slowly enjoy good food, drinks, and conversation with friends, Smallman Galley will feel like the place you are meant to be. The atmosphere has the energy and warmth that comes from cooking a gourmet meal at home with your closest friends. After reading about the concept of the restaurant on their website, it seems this is exactly what they were aiming for when they dreamt up this \"galley.\""}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with Smallman Galley. There is literally something for everyone. The Bahnmilicious place was good. I really liked their bone broth. The only dish I've tried from Colonia so far is the churros, but they did not disappoint! But, if you're a first timer I highly recommend a Detroit style pizza from Iron Born and  the AMAZING yet simple deconstructed s'mores dessert from Brunois. Add in a small, but impressive draft list and you have an awesome and unique dining experience in the heart of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The Ironborn Pizza was amazing!!!!! The dough is like focaccia and the cheese melts down while it's cooking and forms its own kind of crust. Holy crap... I will personally start a GoFundMe account for this chef to make sure he gets his own restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go when you want to hang out and try a bunch of different dishes! Their pizza is hands down the best pizza I've eaten. Ever. Came to Pittsburgh for a long weekend and wound up coming here twice!"}
{"text":"what an awesome concept.. 4 restaurants, one building, and a great bar/beer selection to go along with it.  

to describe this place as a \"hipster cafeteria\" maybe doing it a disservice, but you get the idea.  Highly recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"I have been to the smallman galley twice now this week, first on Tuesday with my father for lunch and last night with my wife for dinner. First off I have to admit that I am a sucker for the concept here. Get 4 up and coming chefs that probably can't afford their own restaurant space and stick them in 4 separate kitchens right next to each other.  They then have 18 months to refine their concept before they are helped by the smallman galley in finding a space to open their restaurant and a new \"class\" comes in.  The seating and everything else is shared by everyone and its a win for everyone.  In some ways it feels like a cafeteria but don't take that lightly as the food is really good and not at all what you would find in a cafeteria.

Walking into the smallman galley you find yourself in a pretty cool industrial space.  There is exposed ductwork and brick walls with tables fitting right in being made of large planks of wood and the chairs being metal.  Outside of the areas where the kitchen is there is also a large seating and a decent sized bar which happens to have a half off happy M-F 5-7.

The first time that I came here I ended up ordering the Bahn Mi from the Provision Pub. It consisted of chicken skin, liver smear, cilantro, pickles, jalepeno and mayo on a baguette and came with a side of fries.  The fries were excellent and had a nice crispy exterior and soft interior while also being seasoned nicely.  However the Bahn Mi I was a little conflicted about.  I absolutely loved the chicken skin and the crunchy texture that it added to the sandwich.  It was the liver smear which turned me off though as it had a gamey type flavor which was hard to get past.  Then the second time that I visited I went with the provision fries from provision as an appetizer to split with my wife and then decided on the duck from Josephine's Toast.  The fries came out first and were on top of a bed of roasted squash purée and came topped with lentils, goat cheese and a lemon aioli.  Much like my previous visit the fries themselves were cooked perfectly and really great.  All of the toppings on it were pretty good too and my wife an I quickly devoured them.  Then after a bit of a wait my duck entree was ready.  Whenever I picked it up I have to admit that the plating looked great but it was also sort of weird to see this amazing looking dinner over top of a piece of smothered toast.  Knowing that this is her concept I accepted that fact but I feel like the dinner could have easily stood on its own.  The plate consisted of duck on top of a piece of toast with crispy kale, tart cherries and a tart cherry sauce all around it.  I found the duck to be cooked nicely to around a medium and enjoyed the flavor of it.  It was especially good dipped into the tart cherry sauce which I wish I could bottle up.  I also really enjoyed the crispy kale which was had a nice crunch to it.  As I mentioned above the toast was the only thing that I found to be weird about the meal although to be fair it wasn't bad.  I just felt like it didn't really fit into the otherwise delectable gourmet meal.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  I love pretty much everything about this place from the ambience to the choice of food and even the food itself."}
{"text":"Wow I went to Provision (a restaurant within the galley) and the grass fed burger was amazing! Smoked mushrooms and baked Parmesan nuggets of deliciousness really made the burger. The horseradish gnocchi was as fantastic as the other reviews mentioned. Definitely must try these two dishes if you haven't had em yet!"}
{"text":"I have tried all four food stalls- did not hit any that disappointed. Hands down loved the toast dishes one with avacado that was a home run and also had a grilled octopus that was thumbs up. The veggie with quinoa, kale with a farm fresh egg and the sweet potatoes were also very good. Ordering is a little hectic but the vibe is young and fun- the staff friendly. Been back three times and highly recommend. It is a little too hectic for me to really relax but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Wow- this was my first trip to Smallman Galley and it did not disappoint! The White Pizza by Iron Born Pizza is on another level!! The thick crust was perfectly crispy and topped with a delicious garlic oil rub rather than tomato sauce (though there are fresh chopped tomatoes on top), and the ricotta cheese dollops were truly heavenly and just the right contrasting texture to the crust. Fresh arugula is sprinkled on the very top, and the combination of these tastes all together makes for a truly unique and scrumptious pizza! The seasoning and herbs used were perfect, and it seemed like there was a hint of lemon in the sauce as well, which kept me craving the next bite. I can't wait to come back and get it again before Iron Born leaves SG! Well done!!!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure I ended up at Smallman Galley because the restaurant my friend and I planned to go to was packed.  But sometimes things happen for a reason, and this time it was a good reason!  I think the concept of Smallman is really interesting and unique to Pittsburgh.  

When I walked in I wasn't sure what was going on.  There was not an evident area for the hostess or to wait for seating.  Well, this is due to the fact that you choose to sit wherever you'd like!  And it is group seating, so you might be at a table with other diners, or you could pick one of the few two tops that are available.  There is plenty of room and I think this is a cool concept.  After you find your seat you have a couple choices for food.  There are several different 'restaurants' inside.  I chose Iron Born Pizza.  It's \"Detroit Style\" which apparently means very thick crust and square shaped.  It was delicious.  I HAD to get it because several other people were eating it and it looked amazing.  I had the mushroom and cheese and it was hard to not eat all six (square) slices!  

I was there during happy hour so drinks were all half off.  Six bucks for a decent glass of wine - yes please!  

For a Thursday evening after work this place was packed.  I look forward to coming back and trying one of the other food options.  I think this would be a fun place for a large group of friends to gather."}
{"text":"If I want to eat at communal tables, serve myself and pay a lot for it, not to mention bus some else's crap off said table so I can sit down I will be happy to go here. Otherwise forget it! A millennials paradise..."}
{"text":"After months of dreaming of Smallman Galley, I finally dined here with good friends in October. I wish that I had been hungrier - and I wish that I had ordered more things - but I was pleased with the dish that I did try. I selected the Carmelized Onion & Pear Tart at Aubergine Bistro. The crust was flaky, and the filling was well-balanced. Looking at the menu now, I should have also gotten the risotto... the lamb & pork meatballs... the shrimp & squid ink pasta... and the roasted pork belly. So many things look outstanding here. Plus, even with this long list of must-haves to try next time I visit, I've barely even looked at Aubergine Bistro's three competitor's menus. Looks like the next round of Smallman Galley restaurants launch on June 6th, 2017, so we'll have to return within the next six months to enjoy the cuisine from the current round of restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing concept (four higher-end incubator restaurants serving food cafeteria-style in a trendy space in the Strip)....I'm not sure about the execution though.

My husband and I came here with some friends on a Saturday night around 8. People, heed my advice....do not come here on a Saturday night around 8. This place was bonkers and it's just not set up to handle being uber busy. I'm okay with organized chaos, but this was just....chaos. 

It's every man, woman, and child for himself in terms of seating, and there were no seats to be had when we were there. The space is definitely not big enough for the amount of people wanting to be there. It doesn't help that this seems to be a sit-and-linger-with-friends kinda place, so table turnover was low. Having a hostess or some kind of way to manage seating besides trying to shark your own table would help the flow here tremendously.

After about 30 mins, we did manage to pounce on a table once some people left. We went up to order. Again...kind of chaotic. Huge lines were forming, and most of the restaurants only had two people behind the counter (frantically cooking), so the service was non-existent. After standing in line for Aubergine for about 10 mins, we were told that they weren't taking any new orders until they finished their current plates. So I had a drink, came back 20 mins later, stood back in line for another 10 mins to order, only to be told that what I wanted was sold out. Ugh. Disappointing to say the least. Anyway, I ordered my second choice dish and waited about 20 mins for it to be ready.

So, despite the chaos around the seating and ordering, how was the food? From Aubergine, my friend and I both got the fresh pasta with seasonal root vegetables and pesto. OMG. This pasta was to die for. The pesto sauce was so flavorful...very well-balanced and not too oily. The root vegetables were roasted to perfection and went well with the pesto sauce. And the pasta itself...mmm...so tender, yet al-dente. Overall, I really loved my meal at Aubergine. Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with my carrot soup starter, which I got from Carota Cafe. I got the last bowl of soup they had, so it was lukewarm, and it was essentially flavorless. Everyone at the table tried it and we all agreed that it kind of tasted like baby food in soup form. The soup is vegan and for me, a well-done vegan soup does not make me miss the dairy...but in this case, the carrot soup was screaming for some texture and richness that would have been helped by some cream. Overall, a very big miss here. My husband got a banh mi with fries from Provision. While the bahn mi was definitely creative (chicken skin, liver smear, pickles, jalapeno, cilantro, mint, mayo), it just seemed a little...underwhelming. I dunno. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind-blowingly delicious. I feel like the chicken skin wasn't able to stand on its own as the main component of the sandwich. It needed another meat or something else to make it more substantial. And the fries that accompanied it, unfortunately, were salty to the point of being inedible. 

Overall, I love the concept and I'd like to go back and give it another shot when it's less of a mad house. The food and experience were mixed, so I can't give this place any higher than 3.5 stars for now, but there's always next time..."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. The food was good. But we came out hungry despite ordering quite a lot of food. The plates were incredibly small."}
{"text":"I like the Vietnamese place but my experience with the \"Mexican\" restaurant was so bad I have to give this place two stars. I went with multiple friends for a dinner and we all figured getting some bowls would be the right call. The food was bland and just tasted like it didn't go together: one example being that they BOILED the plantains and mixed in with white rice. The food was not well seasoned and was incredibly overpriced for the amount of food I got. 

My closing note is that this restaurant just tastes like cultural appropriation. This highlight of the evening was My friends and I bonding over how bad it was: so its great for that!"}
{"text":"So, I have gone to Smallman Galley for a Yelp event and really enjoyed tasting the food! This time I went back for happy hour! I was incredibly pleased! It was nice enough outside to keep the doors open in the bar area so there was plenty of light coming in. Their happy hour prices are amazing! I had two beers along with a cocktail and my bill was around $12! Can't beat it! The location is close and the building is beautiful inside. I am sure I will continue to go back on Fridays after work! The next time I will be sure not to make any dinner plans because I was salivating thinking about trying more items from the various stands! I love the concept and was also incredibly pleased to see that there was an impressive crowd already there when we showed up at 5! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to come check this place out ever since I saw some photos in my feed from an event organized here by the Pittsburg Yelp CM and so was super psyched when local Yelper Phil G suggested coming here for dinner.

It was easy to find parking just a block away and yay, no payment needed after 6pm. Walking into the Smallman Galley, I knew I was in for a treat straightaway - it just had a buzz and a vibe I could feel in the air! 

And I loved the curated restaurants! In one evening I had food from x3 continents! Vietnamese Ice Tea (Asia), Papusa (South America) and Chestnut Soup (Europe)! How cool was it to be able to travel the world, food-wise, without leaving Pittsburgh!

So my thoughts on food & menu as below:

Colonia - cuisines of Latin America
1) I ordered a Pork Pupusa ($6.00) and this was topped with a really lovely tarty fermented slaw with jalapenos pieces that would occasionally pop up and dance in my mouth and cause me to drink up my glass of water in a gulp. I loved the fresh taste of the corn tortilla but one thing - this is a massive plate of food, so would recommend getting it as an entree to share.

2) Yelper Phil G ordered the dessert plate of Churros with chocolate dipping sauce ($6.00). This came pipping hot and and I was super happy that the sugar and cinnamon taste was restrained. For me the highlight however was that dipping chocolate! Reader, I licked that bowl clean - yes, both my dining companions teased me, but I dont care. That Mexican chocolate was so lovely and whatever spices were added, it was thoroughly addictive. Absolutely Recommend!

Banhmilicious
1) I got my drink from here - a glass of Thai Tea for $4.00. I feel these guys are a wee bit cheap. I requested the Thai Tea to be without ice and rather than getting a full glass, I got a 3/4 glass full. I was really taken aback when handed the drink and didn't query the lack of getting a full drink, but wish I had. The taste was superb, but honestly not sure about coming back here, cause I felt like I was gypped from them!! 

brunoise
1) I had the most incredible parsnip & chestnut soup with orange slices from here for $8.00, and frankly it was the highlight of my meal. I so want to go back and try everything from the menu here. They were making fresh chirozo when I ordered the soup and that smell was divine! The texture of the soup was so silky smooth and each spoonful was hearty and falvourful! The burnt orange added an incredible taste!! If you like French Cooking, then go here cause you are in the hands of a master!

2) My other colleague ordered the dessert from here - a lovely Lemon Meringue Tart for $8.00. I loved the taste of the mint that was used and the concord grape sorbet was just massively refreshing and to my palate, didnt taste grape-y at all. In fact I thought I was eating something made of apples and prunes and we went back to the restaurant counter to confirm what the Sorbet was made of.

Overall Verdict?? GO GO GO!

PS - I thought of knocking a star down b/c of the service received from Banhmilicious but brunoise & Colonia's food made me so happy, it overcame that lack!

{"text":"Incredible food and atmosphere! We were visiting from San Francisco to plan our wedding in Pittsburgh, and heard the best things about Smallman Galley. It ended up being the perfect choice for a cute rehearsal dinner the day before our wedding. We rented out the back room, and our event was about 50 people.  All of our friends had Yelped Smallman Galley and had really high expectations for the food--the chefs did not disappoint. The first course included passed appetizers that were served while all the guests mingled, and the other three courses were served on the large beautiful wooden tables. The main course included a vegetarian dish, seasonal lamb, and curried seafood. 

Noelle, our primary contact, was at the event the whole time and made sure everything ran smoothy. The Smallman staff were so fun and friendly! We were visiting from San Francisco, and had a reunion wedding in Pittsburgh, and although we couldn't invite everyone to the dinner itself, it was so awesome to have the Smallman Bar there as a way to get a large group of people together. 

The only reason this is a 4 star is because we had a hard time getting a contract signed with Smallman, and the initial communication was choppy. I'd recommend that the Smallman team have someone to man the phoneline, because it's really hard to communicate exclusively via email. I reached out in October and didn't really have a contract signed until June-ish when we absolutely needed to send wedding invites out. We were working with someone who'd often go 5 weeks without reply, but once Noelle got involved, she was extremely attentive and even compensated us half the deposit for the trouble. Overall, this is a great business concept, run by some awesome people. Thanks to Noelle and the whole team for an amazing event."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Place for upcoming chefs to try their creations! Great place to come with a group and each get to pick what they like - 4 restaurants to choose from! We tried BM or Banhmilicious' Banh Mi sandwich with pork as protein choice, Tacos with beef and Vietnamese flavor, and the rice noodle with Enlightenment protein (tofu+). We also tried the seared tuna special from Colonia. Everything was so flavorful and had a touch of the chef's uniqueness. Definite adventure with friends and family. A must visit."}
{"text":"This is such a cool concept! Four different restaurants sit in 1 location. Each offer different cuisines from the oldie but delicious meatball sandwich to asian gastropub with pork belly ramen to something out of the box - stewed lamb with squash goat cheese atop of fries to my favorite, grits with a tomato sauce and meatballs. (Prices ranges between $5-20)

You order food at one of the restaurant stations. They give you a number and bring the food out to you when it's down. For libations, a bar sits directly across from the stations offering all types of beverages to marry with your food selection. 

Seating definitely wouldn't be called spacious but it's a pretty cool environment. The bar area is on the rustic side with the trendy Edison bulbs dangling above. There's additional seating in a side area but I didn't get to check that out."}
{"text":"This place reminds me a lot of San Pedro Square in San Jose CA. Common area to sit and enjoy four different mini eateries plus a really cool bar. The octopus was top notch... My favorite dish of the night. Good beer selection at the bar, but I was a little disappointed that there weren't more bourbon/rye based crafted cocktails (at least on the menu). Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Omg so my girlfriend look this place up on yelp! She knows I love gastro pubs the FOOD! Here is F'n!!!! Amazing  there is like 5 restaurants in this place... so bring ur friends family or date here.. 
check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"This place is such a neat concept, a little confusing my first time. But there are multiple restaurants set up and you order from them. The food is to die for did not have anything. I didn't like. We went to this radish one forget the name but the sunflower bread was the best. Had scallops from another place. Best time to go is definitely during dinner. We went during lunch and will have to say a lot of them were closed and prepping for the dinner service."}
{"text":"Smallman is an exciting incubator for chefs and locals alike, to try diverse and classic foods from around the world.

However, despite the atmosphere and the selection, the execution of the food falls under standard. For example, I ordered a Detroit Style pizza from Iron Born, and although it was alright, it was just that. A lot of bread, and some touches of finesse on the top.

More disappointing was Colonia, which gave a nice presentation and ambitions for a fancy dish, but made a mediocre food. For the flank steak, the meat was essentially rubber and the rest of the veggies were very strongly flavored. For the chicken bowl, there were these donut shaped starch things, and a ton of extraneous veggies. I'm not even sure if there was chicken, but the dish was so salty I didn't bother finding out. Overall, my impression of Colonia was that the chefs were trying too hard...I think it's important to  keep the essential parts of the dish simple, not to over salt things, and not to crowd the plate with a jambalaya of ingredients.

Overall, I had an underwhelming experience, but Smallman is still a very legit place with great options and cooling culture."}
{"text":"BRILLIANCE. Pure brilliance. Downright pure brilliance. Brilliance so bright that you can't even look your roasted beets and avocado toast in the eye. You know how this joint works. You've heard the rants; you've heard the raves, but you should hear them again. Or maybe you haven't. Four chefs in one building just kinda experimenting and learning how to make food; then in eighteen months they'll leave for their own restaurant and to make way for a new chef. Providing people liked them and they were successful. Chances are, with this kind of buzz and hype flying around about Smallman Galley alone, any chef that enters within it's support will succeed. 

First off, I ordered some toast from, I'll let you guess, Josephine's Toast. Avocado toast. That alone was worthy of five stars. I would totally go to a brick and mortar House of Toast by Josephine. 

Provision lured me in with their Roasted Beets, because I'd never had anything like that before. Slabs of beets sitting in preserved lemon jam, a pile of crisp watercress sprinkled with crunchy quinoa granola, and roasted mushrooms and cashews tossed over the whole mess. This amazing mix was well worth the try even if it was by far not my favorite thing I've eaten. 

The BAD BAD problem here is that an hour and a half drive for a meal is generally not justifiable. Which is what I'll have to do multiple times in order to try several dishes from every single chef that ever walks through these doors."}
{"text":"Love this place! It was fun to choose what to eat as there are variety of choices.

Place was open and easy to find a table. Also it was convenient as the server delivered our food instead of picking up."}
{"text":"Iron Born pizza makes me drool when I think of it! We've had some really good dishes from the other stalls too- salads, a s'mores dish, etc. The bar usually seems understaffed and a little inconsistent. We've gone during peak hours and seating can sometimes be challenging to find. It's an awesome concept though and one we will definitely continue to keep supporting."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love this place. The concept is unique to Pittsburgh and, indeed, to many cities. I can't review the current food as the chefs and all change every 18 months and I haven't tried the newest four (basically, four counters each offering a mini-restaurant's menu with a chef that passed a test to get in). I think the standards to get a spot there are quite high. I was never disappointed by the first round of mini-restaurants/chefs.

The space is wonderfully casual. Long tables with water and water glasses waiting for you; stations with your silverware, napkins and more for you to help yourself...and the bar. Oh my gosh, they've hired some of the best bartenders in the city to make drinks in this quite large bar area. Even if you're not hungry, go for the drinks. They will not let you down."}
{"text":"Pros - Nice to have a diverse set of restaurants to pick from and the Burger I got from Provision was decent.

Con - I asked for some ketchup/catsup from Josephines Toast. They told me it was 50cents per container (little contained that you normally get for dressing:. 
1. The containers weren't even full. 
2. I'm guessing they tried to make home made ketchup, was a bad effort, was like red water, zero thickness. 

Would give it another go, knowing vendors rotate."}
{"text":"This place. Is. Awesome. Definitely a new favorite. 

Four chefs compete to have a space in this \"restaurant incubator\" with an 18 month opportunity to curate and perfect their own special creations. The only problem I have is it takes me so damn long to decide what the heck I want! 

One thing to love about this place is that although these chefs are here temporarily before they open their own place, they are NOT joking around. They have experience. Their food is good. And you are definitely getting a fair deal; once these chefs move on to their own restaurant, their stuff is going to cost a lot more - eat it up while you can. 

Right now you have:

Rafael at Aubergine Bistro is offering a mix of \"everything from Creole to Cajun to Baja.\" I've had his pot pie, and its really good. He's worked at Spoon, Legume, and Hyeholde which are all great places.

Jessica at Carota Cafe is working with local farms to provide \"vegetable-forward\"dishes using natural/sustainable/humane foods. She's the former Sous Chef from The Commoner, and also was a contestant on \"Hells Kitchen.\" I went the other day, and was apparently the first to try her Moqueca (a Brazilian seafood stew... that I had to pronounce before I could order haha) and WOW. It reminded me a bit of curry, served with rice, delicious, and was the perfect thing the day after a big snow storm.

Jacqueline of Josephine's toast makes all kinds of things that you'd like to eat, except ON TOP OF TOAST. She's worked with The Common Plea, Marty's Market, Eleven, Isabela, and also appeared on Food Network's Cutthroat Kitchen. Not to mention, she's rad. 

I'd have to say my favorite right now is Stephen's Provision PGH. After repeatedly ordering food from him, I find myself being forced to try other peoples things, since his are just so hard to say no to. There's no real pinpoint of specific cultural influence, rather how all the flavors from different cultures have influenced meat in the US. He does a good job at bringing together many different flavors and unexpected things to make one great dish.

There's more.

The bar is just as wonderful as the food. There are 20 local beers on tap, and each chef has a few special cocktails on the bar menu. Also, Veronica, the bartender, has stolen my heart. Not just because she's cute and nice, but she is extremely talented, and can whip you up something great. =]

And for everyone that loves coffee, theres a coffee and espresso bar that opens at 8am pretty much every day. 

TRY IT."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley opened after I moved from the burgh, and I have been itching to come back here since I heard about the concept, which is perfect for a group of people who have a lot of palettes to please. My mom and I came here for lunch on a rainy Wednesday after we finished shopping in the Strip. It was around 12:30pm and was not very crowded save for a few groups of workers from nearby businesses. I was also excited my mom agreed to step out of her comfort zone and try something different so I could experience SG! 

As others have noted, the concept is reminiscent of a food hall and offers four different \"restaurants\" to eat at. For each one, you order at the counter, take a number, and your food is brought out when ready. I appreciated the large amount of dining space available; seems great for groups. I also liked the water on each table already available for use. There is a bar, but I can't comment on that aspect of SG. 

My mom and I both chose to eat at Provision Pittsburgh, however, the setup and ordering process is quite conducive to each person ordering from a different concept. Since all the current concepts have been described, I'm not going to rehash them. The cashier at Provision filled us in on the fact that this was their (and all others) last week, and the new concepts will begin next week. 

My mom ordered \"the burger\"-Beef Pattie | Simple Greens | Parmesan Frica | Umami Aioli | Smoked Mushrooms | Cheddar | Challah  and chose the fries over the simple salad. The Umami aioli was similar to chipotle mayo and was a great dipper for the fries. The fries were delicious when they were hot, which they were upon the dish's arrival. The salt and herb mixture sprinkled on the fries was flavorful and these were clearly fresh cut, crispy, and triple fried-YUM! My mom thought it was juicy, and cooked perfectly to her requested medium temp. I ordered the banh mi-Sweet & Sour Pork | Pickled Onion & Carrot | Cilantro | Mint | Smoked Peanut Aioli | Baguette with a simple salad as my side. The portion of the salad was generous and the light vinaigrette was tasty, perhaps a lemon vinaigrette. I was more focused on the banh mi, which was delicious! First, the portion was extremely generous and filling. The baguette was crispy and fresh, and the pork was crispy with a distinctive sweet and sour coating. I loved the smoked peanut aioli which was, obviously, smoky, and added a sweeter flavor to the dish. The pickled onions and carrots was on point and the addition of jalapenos added that little kick. I appreciated the mint which mitigated some of the heavy cilantro flavor. All of the flavors weaved together wonderfully in a nice, succinct platter. 

I definitely cannot wait to see what the new concepts at Smallman Galley will be, and hopefully I can return to try one of them during my next trip to the Burgh!"}
{"text":"I love this place because of its happy hour! It's half off all drinks, including tasty cocktails, liquor, wine and a good selection of draft beers from 5-7, Tue-Fri."}
{"text":"A co-worker recommended we go here as she is vegan as well and she has eaten here many times. After reading the reviews, I had to agree that this seemed to be a logical place for us. Located in the Strip District, it is a wonderful location for shopping and then a quick lunch. The space hosts 4 other counters where you can order a variety of dishes, including Vegan pizza. We decided on a tofu bowl with rice from...well, I can't remember the name now, but it is the 2nd one when you come in the front door. Ordering is quick and simple. After you place your order you can either sit in the bar area or sit in the well-lit side area. Since it was not after 5 pm we decided to sit in the side area. It did not take long to get our meal, which was delicious. We had also ordered a Ginger Lemonade which was divine. 

Outside of the food being delicious, the service was impeccable. After receiving our meal, someone else came by to ask how we were doing and how we had heard about the place. Come to find out they are opening another location. Since I am not from Pittsburgh I didn't remember because I didn't care, but it was nice of him to mention it. 

Our dishes were cleared quickly before we decided it depart. I will certainly come here again the next time I am in Pittsburgh. 

Word to the wise: lunch is pretty pricey so be forewarned."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese food was wonderful and arrived quickly too. Tried an egg and bacon fried rice with a runny egg on top, served with some beef broth. Also ordered a mushroom omelet with side salad from Brunoise which took too long to arrive (did they forget my order?). The omelet was just average."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this out after multiple friends had said they loved the concept. I may have gone at an off time, but my experience was nothing special. I looked at all four stations and settled on the second station. I ordered from that and decided to give the first station a try. That guy was distracted by holding his baby and never even acknowledged me after standing there a while. And no offense, I am a mother who struggled through the 'balancing family and work' years. I decided I would come back and try something for dessert. When I went back the guy was really pre-occupied with whatever he was doing (looking through containers general kitchen stuff.). I felt I was making enough of a presence but after standing around for a while I just decided to leave. Maybe I shouldn't expect the chefs to have great customer service skills, but in honesty this did affect how I viewed my overall experience. I may give it another shot at a different time of day since what I did order from station two was delicious, and one of those meals you have to pause between each bite because the flavor is just that enjoyable."}
{"text":"Do not miss!!! It's the most delicious well designed lunch spot ever! Pizza is phenomenal, the sandwiches and stuff from each place was unbelievably scrumptious !!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the concept. As someone who is very indecisive, this plays right into my alley. Furthermore, the idea that this space is helping chefs develop their menus is very heart warming! It's nice to know that these small businesses don't have to worry about their location costs when making the best food they can! 

Although it's a lot of different flavors, the ability to try a bunch of things and share among a few friends or family is priceless. It's my favorite quality about this place: diversity in the menu. Also, we took recommendations only from the waitress and I can safely say she has good taste!

We got tacos from the Vietnamese place, iron born pizza, and a burger as well. The tacos were so good we got seconds and tasted very fresh. The tortilla complimented the sauces and meat nicely, which was surprising to me. The pizza was thick and the dough was airy and sweet. It was almost as if you could taste the amount of time and effort put into making that dough. The burger was delicious. It was juicy and flavorful and just made me want to eat more.

I would highly suggest coming here with a large group of people so that you have the chance to share and experience more! This is definitely a place to try new things and try a lot of them."}
{"text":"Really cool concept. I had some amazing buffalo cauliflower there at a happy hour a few weeks ago. It was AMAZING and far better than most bar snacks for the waistline. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The food was great. Fun place to take co-workers from out of town. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent but I found it to be a bit overpriced for the quality and quantity of food provided. 

I like the concept of this place - basically it's an \"incubator\" for restaurants. While it was interesting to see multiple kitchens in one space, operating as different restaurants, as a college student who was trying to eat filling meals at a reasonable cost...I didn't feel like Smallman Galley was a place that I could regularly visit. The novelty of it or the type of food provided also wasn't as exciting to me to warrant spending the amount of money that I did. 

With all that said, the food was still tasty...just not my style."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to review Smallman Galley's food because of why this place exists. So...let me start there...

Smallman Galley is a restaurant incubator (kind of) for new restaurants! 4 restaurants are in this place for a year and use the time to build a client base. Then, after their time at Smallman Galley, they can launch their own restaurant. Really cool concept! 

It's kind of like Shark Tank. 

Well, not really. 

First, you can sit anywhere where there is an open seat. 

Second, go to a restaurant (or multiple) and order. 

Third, they will give you a placard to place on your table, and they will magically bring it to you!

Fourth, also magically, people will be walking around to give you water and stuff. 

Magical. 

*Take note, you have to grab your own plates and utensils from one of the couple stations around the room. 

Fifth, eat and enjoy! Eat and enjoy in a very smartly and cool-ly designed space, which is great for large groups or even that hot date you hope might lead to the family you know you are scared to begin yet long to have. 

Want a cool dining experience in a great space supporting what I will gladly call a great cause? Look no further...

Smallman is the bigman on campus!! 

(Yeah, I don't know what that means either.)"}
{"text":"I love it here so so much! Usually I head to Ironborn for some amazing deep dish. Last week I went to La Colonia Pgh and got a breakfast sandwich that just blew me away.

I like to order first, claim a table and then grab a drink from the bar.

I had the Pao de Queijo breakfast sandwich. It was truly one of the most delish sandwiches I have ever had. It was made with Brazilian cheese bread, which is basically a carb from heaven itself. It cradled a dippy egg and some roasted turkey. And since there's no such thing as too much cheese, there was also some chihuahua cheese in there too! The aji aioli was incredible.

I'm glad I branched out and can't wait to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR IN PITTSBURGH! Hands down. They have half off drinks and they are all incredible cocktails. Also, a great spot for private events. The entire concept to me is interesting and I think this was something that Pittsburgh desperately needed."}
{"text":"I don't know how, but I always ended up going somewhere else instead of smallman galley.  I finally made it here on the last day before they switch to new restaurant concepts.  So glad I was able to make it in time because the provision burgers are LEGIT!! 

We had \"the burger\" and \"the farm\" both were cooked a perfect medium.  Fries were delish and the salad was a really good refreshing side.  God the lemon aioli as well on the side for the fries and it was delicious.  Only odd thing is they don't have ketchup... the burgers are very rich and could have used an acidic condiment or more pickle to add a bite/freshness.  

I'd give the burger a 4 - 4 1/2 because of this.  The overall smallman galley concept is 5 star!"}
{"text":"A ton of options as there are four different kitchens (each with varied menus) and at least one bar. Lots of space for seating (there's one large area by the bar, and a separate room for diners) which is great! Ambiance was great and I can definitely see why people would come here on a Friday or Saturday night.

 Unfortunately when I went to Smallman I wasn't super hungry, so all I had was a salad (and my SO got a beer). The salad was a little bit salty and quite small, also overpriced (maybe a function of the location). Can't comment on much else, but if we ever come back I'd definitely like to try a few more dishes!"}
{"text":"I have visited Smallman Galley many times, and I have loved it every time. Today was my first visit to the new concepts (which tend to rotate in June), so I was excited to try out some new food for brunch.

I ordered the Salmon Plate from Joey's Snack Bar. The plate consisted of salmon, a fresh and lightly dressed salad, a perfectly hard boiled egg with a wet yolk, and herb cream cheese spread. It arrived with bread that was reminiscent of an everything bagel. The whole bite was absolutely delicious when I spread some of the cream cheese on the \"bagel\", topped with salmon, a bit of the egg, and some of the salad. It was the perfect brunch dish.

I also grabbed a bloody mary from the bar. I wasn't the biggest fan of the drink because it tasted very vinegar heavy with a lot of horseradish but not a lot of other complex flavors that are present in an excellent bloody mary. Oh well, I still drank the whole thing--my palate is not that discerning.

I will definitely be stopping by Joey's again, and I can't wait to try out Home as well!"}
{"text":"mm mm mmmmm. Excuse me as I scarf down this entire box of pizza, as there will be absolutely no sharing. Hand Forged, and all mine. 

I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the City of Detroit in its entirety, as I previously dismissed your pizza as a gimmick, or even n imitation Chicago deep dish. I know...fighting words. But Detroit style pizza, really?! Apparently yes really! By way of Pittsburgh. 

Smallman Galley has been on my radar for quite some time now. The four restaurant open concept is pretty cool if I must say. Out of the four, Hand Forged easily topped my wish list; I mean it's not often you run into this style of pizza. 

The two sauce pie is perfect for undecideds like myself: half white, half red. And feeling extra fancy, I opt to add pepperoni to the red side. After one bite, I float into pizza heaven. Red sauce, oven crispified pepperoni, creamy white sauce, mounds of cheese, and fennel sausage(you can put that stuff on anything and id eat it). This is nothing like a Chicago deep dish! The chewy crust makes all the difference. And with the oven browning the edges, you get both chewy and crispy crust in one bite. Like I previously stated...pizza heaven. 

Pittsburgh is legit one of the most underrated culinarily destinations in the country in my humble opinion. Never disappoints. Add Hand Forged Pizza to the list of greats. As for the other three restaurants at Smallman, as long as this pizza is within arms length, I might never get around to its neighbors...like ever. 

By the way, for anyone wondering which is better, red or white? Well that's easy. The winner is....me. For having consumed both."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots in the city! On Fridays, the bar is slammed at happy hour, but any other weekdays is a stellar time to enjoy very nicely priced cocktails, wine, and beer/cider (yes, they do have cider)! Since they don't have table service, you can get HH prices even when sitting outside the bar (you just need to go put in the drink order yourself), which opens up a lot of options. This is an incredible place to go with picky friends, because there are many choices of cuisine, let alone entree, but an even better place to go with adventurous friends and then just eat family style.

I've gone 4-5 times over the last year, so menu items may have changed, but Provision's \"poutine\" and Josephine's sweet toasts (her peach cardamom jam is AMAZING) are both favorites and repeat orders for me. Husband got some great chicken and waffles here at brunch, and I went healthier with a salmon egg white scramble (Carota Cafe). Balance is key, so we shared.

This is also a really cool space, and they have multiple adjoining rooms that are suitable for private parties. Basically, Smallman Galley is appropriate for any occasion that doesn't involve ballgowns, and even then...I'd go for it. Note: you're notified your order is ready via text, so if you don't have a texting plan (or a cell phone??), sit at the bar alongside the restaurants and they'll bring your order to you."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place. There are four different restaurant concepts to order from and there is open seating. I liked how it was friendly to any type of diet. They had many vegan/vegetarian options. I loved the different food combinations and ethnic inspiration from different countries. I ended up getting the beef cheek. It reminded me pho with the egg and noodles. It was very flavorful and unique. I liked how they text you when the order was ready. I also liked the prices so you don't break the bank and can have an opportunity to try several things from the different restaurants. I really wanted to try the squash grilled cheese but I was full. A lot of us shared each other's food and they all tastes great."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my late lunch at Smallman yesterday from the Carota Cafe stall at Smallman Galley. It was a bit pricey (even by my Brooklyn standards), but exquisitely delicious. I had the ginger gnocchi ($15), which was served with fresh tatsoi and  crispy kale over a savory bed of spiced pureed winter squash. I found myself rubbing the tatsoi into the squash with my fork to swipe up every last bit of its bright orange goodness. I have to say, it was quite a savory, rich vegetarian meal, but it wasn't a huge amount of food. I was glad to have ordered the golden tea ($4) as well, as its turmeric-black peppercorn-almond milk-coconut oil goodness helped fill me up enough to make it to dinner. 

Service was reasonably quick, and the ambiance was rustic and casual. While I ate, I saw two guys from a local brewery come in with some wares for the bar staff to sample. People seemed to be enjoying the wares featured on the long beer list, too! Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"A fun night out--and everyone can pick their own entree from one of four kitchens. My only complaint is sometimes the menu and chalkboards don't describe the dishes well and it's hard to get answers when its busy."}
{"text":"Fun place for a casual meal.   The food turns over all the time as it is an incubator for chefs but the atmosphere is great and the variety of options from the four chef stations 
should make anyone happy."}
{"text":"We took a group of 8 here and it is a great place for groups. Each of us was able to go to our own \"booth\" and order what we wanted. I had spaghetti and my wife had pho. My spaghetti was great...her pho was just OK. They also have pizza, hamburgers, etc... The bar was also doing happy hour so all drinks were 1/2 off. IF I had been there not during happy hour, I probably would have concluded that the drinks were too expensive. Amazingly for a quick serve type atmosphere the customer service was great."}
{"text":"We had to go back twice because there is a pizza with lemon and ricotta. It is so good. The setting is very casual and welcoming. Great beer and wine options."}
{"text":"I like their pho beef noodle soup, it's the best I've ever found in pittsburgh. However, it's more pricy than other pho places."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful concept and a great addition to the strip district. The gnocchi was fabulous."}
{"text":"I went in the mid afternoon in a Saturday and I had to settle on my third pick of dishes as places were running out of items for the day. What I needed up getting was very good. The variety keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the Michigan game. Awesome food and fantastic vibe! Would definitely recommend this for both drinks and food. Would be wary of Aubergine Bistro - the gentleman working there is very rude and is more than willing to express it."}
{"text":"Right next to Pamela's Diner in the Strip District, this is one of our favorite spots after a day of shopping in the Strip.  The cocktail menu is full of ingredients that I have no idea what they are....but the bartenders make magic happen when they put together one for you.  The beer on tap is local and mighty tasty.  The food is always different since the 4 chefs have rotating chalkboard menus.  We have been going to the SG since the first group of chefs arrived and will definitely continue going back."}
{"text":"Had the pierogie toast at Josephine's Toast. Loved it. Everyone loved their food and the space."}
{"text":"I would rate Smallman Galley four and a half stars.

I only had a chance to order drinks, but they also serve food. The beer menu is fantastic. It's extremely local based. There are about a dozen drafts on tap of which almost all are local and craft. There are options from Hop Farm, Grist House, the Brew Gentlemen and more. There were some breweries from outside the Pittsburgh area, but the only brewery on tap that was out of Pennsylvania was Fat Head's."}
{"text":"This was easily among the most enjoyable dinners I've ever had.  The food was great, the concept fun and exciting, the service friendly and helpful - really no downside. Each of us were joyfully discovering the ingredients in our choices. It was like opening a Christmas gift with each bite!"}
{"text":"Lots of different options I look forward to exploring with a bar to boot! Excellent experiences thus far. 4 stars because it's a bit pricy."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Strip District. The restaurants do change out, so I'll more so review the space itself.

The entry way has plenty of seating, although the space has been busy when I've been there, I think an average day might allow for larger groups to be seated for breakfast. There is a separate bar area - offering a full bar for cocktails and local draught beers. The coffee bar, near the other entrance, connects to the bar area - offering different feels for the space. Next to the kitchen area there are also bar seating for smaller groups or individual patrons. 

This would be a great venue for a private event as well. We looked into it for a celebration at one time and were very interested in the private patio area and separate spaces. We didn't end up going in that direction, but it was a great venue that I would recommend others taking a look at."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. The set up reminds me of an underground Chinese cafeteria with a much more upscale atmosohere. You get in line to order, take a number, and they bring it to you. The seating isnt very spacious near the bar, but they have booths in other areas if you are with a group. This was my first time here, and I've been dying to try Iron Born Pizza based on their reviews. I got a veggie pizza, it was called Garden something or other. I can't remember the exact name. The crust was coated in crispy cheese and the inside of it was nice and fluffy, not too dense. I would have liked to have more veggies on it. There was shaved asparagus, but my pallet couldn't quite locate the flavor of any gevvies aside from the mushrooms. Other than that, it was delicious. One pizza will definitely feed 2 hungry people. I'd like to return soon to try the other places that have vegetarian options."}
{"text":"So, it can be hectic on the weekends and hard to get around when it is busy. I love the concept and the food is FANTASTIC at the places we have had an opportunity to eat so far. I am a big fan of the coffee house that is next to the bar. Overall I enjoy it here I just wish it was a little easier to get around. Also, if you get stuck by the table at the door in the winter it is kind of miserable."}
{"text":"This was my first time for dinner, and I was surprised that on a Friday night around 8 PM it wasn't busier (maybe we got lucky?). The place has open seating, so once you order from one of the 4 kitchens or bars you take your number to an empty table. The atmosphere reminds me of Union Fare or Chelsea Market in NYC. Smallman Galley is unique in its mission: it supports up and coming Pittsburgh chefs by providing them a platform to share their innovative culinary ideas, renditions, and concepts. I'd say that most of the menu options are typically pricier than I'd like but WORTH the trip.

Banhmilicious
-Rice ($12.15): Ordered w/ chicken. Originally, nervous that the dish would be the very bland - just the basic rice & chicken. Instead, the dish exhibited wonderful flavor

Colonia
-Cochinita Pibtl ($14): I'm partial to any dish that has pork, so I naturally chose the marinated pork with pickled red onions and rice. The meat was tender with a smokey flavor. Didn't taste too fatty or dry. Overall, the dish was delicious and filling
-Churros ($7): Fun-shaped and paired with thick chocolate sauce. They were kind of oily and wished they had more crunch
-Divorce Bowl"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for large group dinner, brunch, and even better for happy hour. Smallman Galley is the first \"restaurant incubator\" of its time, offering four totally separate/different kitchen concepts under one roof, with a full service bar on the adjacent side of the building. Very cool that Pittsburgh is the first to offer such a model. The four kitchen concepts just rotated out, and the second set of chef's just set up in early June 2017. The four different kitchens all have their own concept with their core menu, plus new items continuously popping up week to week. You order and pay at each individual kitchen, then are given a number and asked to seat wherever you please, and your food will be brought out once ready. The full service bar is always packed and offers some of the best cocktails, wine, plus a huge craft beer menu featuring your favorite creations from the city's best microbrews. They feature an awesome happy hour, half off all wine, beer, and cocktails from 5-7 Tuesday-Friday. Commonplace Coffee also just set up shop inside, so you can grab yourself one of their awesome espresso drinks. Seating is on a first-come, first-serve basis, with long tables for communal type seating. There are a few TVs inside. Draws a crowd for happy hour and during the weekends, especially for brunch. So excited that a second location is opening on the North Side in Nova Place. We'll get the chance to experience three new concepts, since one of the original kitchens from the first class of chefs, Provision, will be featured against in the second SG location."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is awesome! Bar + restaurant incubator, which basically is everyone's dream come true for a night out - pick and choose what you're in the mood for pizza to pupusas, they have it all!

We met friends here the night we got in to Pittsburgh. It was Friday night and we had been driving for over four hours so it was time for a drink. They had some solid cider options on tap, I got a great light bodied red wine from Cotes du Rhone. We hung out for a few hours - there's lots of space and seating. It never got too crowded either. One couple in our group got pupusas - one with cheese and potato, one with meat - we all had bites because they were big and filling! Awesome flavor. The meat one was spicy. 

I got a kick out of the VHS tape style drink menu with an homage to The Sandlot.

Definitely a good night out spot for drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"Great meal and experience!!  Atmosphere a bit loud, but lots of fun.  Such a cool concept, each restaurant has 18 months to prove itself.

Wonderful meals across the board.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food: delicious. Trying to order: total train wreck. We went on a steady Saturday afternoon and it was a nightmare trying to figure out where to order and who was in line. But when you taste the food you completely forget about all of that because it's amazing. First we tried Carota Cafe.... we had the herbed baked eggs and the house ricotta w blueberry chia jam, both served with their house made whole grain sourdough toast. Wow! Both were so great, the ricotta was super fresh and creamy, and the herbed eggs were perfectly accompanied with roasted root vegetables in a cast iron skillet. Next, we tried the homemade pasta and grilled shrimp from Aubergine Bistro. Served in a parsnip butter with parsnips and shiitake mushrooms, it was so fresh and flavorful. Ended with Millie's Almond Butter ice cream, which was BANGIN! Can't wait to go back and try the other 2 restaurants. Hopefully this sweet joint gets more streamlined."}
{"text":"This is an AWESOME place to grab a bite to eat. It is a kitchen incubator, which means seating is modern cafeteria-esque, and the kitchens (4) are on a rotation. Normally, the kitchens have a year to be in place and then if the restaurant idea is a hit, they hopefully can open a shop somewhere in the city and if not, it was a good run. Currently, the four restaurants serving are fantastic. I have had each one. I will give a slight shout out to Iron Born, even though they don't need it, because I want to see this Pizza shop open for years to come. The two bars are also on rotation and most likely hold the same lease length. Go support local chefs and their dreams, eat delicious food, and have a great date night with your lady or fellow."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday while my wife and I were in the strip. I love the idea of different types of food available at one venue. The food was excellent and the staff were amazing at making everything work. Finding tables with their food and keeping everything flowing."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could.  In addition to an amazing concept, the food here is out of this world! I came here for an event and ended up ordering a full meal from Brunoise. 
Ho.ly. Cow.
I've had a lot, and I mean A LOT, of cheeseburgers from across the country and Europe, and the burger from Brunoise was far and away the best burger I have EVER had. The burger itself was so juicy and flavorful! The bun was soft and fresh. The combo of the cheeses and other toppings just meshed so well together. I am salivating just writing this review!!!
I also ordered the Smores dessert after seeing and hearing a lot of buzz surrounding it. It was fabulous! The chocolate was divine AND it had Millie's ice cream---I lean what else do you need, right?
To top it all off, the chef was super nice! 
I'll happily go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm this is the most genius concept. What a great way to grow chef talent pool and test out new concepts/cuisines. 

I went for the Iron Born Brunch Pizza. All you need to know is I told the guy who dropped off my pizza that I loved him. Now did I need a $18 pizza just for myself  ... no. But my god. It was so worth it. The crust is thick but light. There was sausage, an amazing gravy, herbs, crisp potatoes on top with \"dippy\" eggs (using my new found PA terminology). 

I'm already looking forward to waking up tomorrow so I can eat my mound of leftovers. That's how excited that pizza gets me. 

As far as aesthetic, Small Man Galley is industrial modern, with a touch of minimalist. Also can we talk about how hella cute their drink menus are (they are VHS tape holders, branded). 

Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding what to order with 4 unique chefs and plenty of creative menu offerings. The Burger of the Moment special by Provisions caught my eye. Provisions : Beef Pattie | Smoked Blue Cheese | Bacon | Whole Grain Mustard Aioli | Organic Greens | Onion Jam | Cheddar | Sesame Challah Bun. I did have a bit of FOMO after placing my order. I was in a food & chef incubator with all these fun dishes and I went with a burger...? I'm meant to be an experimental foodie. But I am so glad I did choose the burger. I am serious when I say it was amazing. Through my life travels (haha minuscule) I've tipped my toes into the world of unique \"artisan\" burgers. Gordon Ramsey's lamb & goats cheese burger is at the top of my list. This burger of the moment by Provisions joined that top 5 list, conquering my FOMO.

It was tasty, juicy and I barely shared a bite with my boyfriend. Even the fries were unique! If you're not into salty you might not like these fries, but I am. So I loved them. They were crisp, not greasy, very salty (celery salt maybe?), but also seasoned well (parsley maybe?) for an added dimension of flavor. I am so over plain boring fries."}
{"text":"Love this concept.  4 different \"restaurants\" in one communal space with a bar and coffee shop.  The \"restaurants\" change over time.  There are communal dining tables, so you can get one dish at one place and something else at another one.  The bar has a bunch of local beers.  Everyone should be able to find something they will love."}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place, do yourself a favor and make a visit.  Place is very cool.  Great food, great beers, great concept.  I have had food from all of the current eateries.  All very good. Pizza is excellent.  Everything from brunoise has been outstanding.

I have one con.  Hoping management reads these reviews.  Today there were a bunch of Michigan fans watching the football game.  No beef with Michigan.  Great school and in my experience, good people.  I just think the sports bar atmosphere is such a buzz kill and inconsistent with the general awesome vibe of the place.  Understand that one of the owners is a Michigan grad and this is why this goes on.  Here's my appeal to have the Maize and Blue fans go to a sports bar instead of Smallman Galley."}
{"text":"This is a really innovative dining experience! Able to walk around a galley of different chefs that are showcasing their talents and partake a little from each! Every chef has their own flare, offering your palate a plethora of choices at one stop! This is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a cute
Cozy vibe and it's something different than the usual place you go sit
And have a waiter. The food is always diff and excellent"}
{"text":"This place is a must-have food stop in Pittsburgh. The best of the new upcomers in Pittsburgh cuisine, the different food stations change every 6 months, with different chefs and their associated\"restaurants\". Always good, always fresh and new."}
{"text":"I've been to Smallman Galley a bunch of times. I wasn't sure what I thought of the concept when it was released, but I've grown to love it. I love that you can have so many options with 4 separate restaurant menus and an on-site bar. If someone can't find something they like, there's something wrong with them!

I've had lots of favorites in the first batch of restaurants and new favorites in the second batch. I actually am growing to appreciate their brunch options (since the other breakfast stops in the Strip have become such tourist traps). Common Place coffee is clutch in the mornings."}
{"text":"As we increasingly become a culture of startups, it makes sense that the culinary world should be no exception. To this end, Smallman Galley is Pittsburgh's very first chef/restaurant incubator. What a great concept!  I definitely share other reviewers' enthusiasm for it.

They've got some really nice cocktails and a very solid (rotating) selection of beers on tap. This place is KILLER for happy hours!  Half off all cocktails, beer, and wine. Yes please!

I love the space as well, although it did get a bit crowded near the bar (where the space is kind of narrow). It's got that rustic chic look, with reclaimed wood and exposed brick walls, that many newer Pittsburgh bars and restaurants are picking up.

Food wise, my partner and I tried the banh mi and the burger from Provision.  The burger was solid, cooked well, but pretty basic. It wasn't anything to write home about. The banh mi had nice flavors, but I was not into the chicken skin concept. I wanted to give it a try, because I actually really enjoy crispy, well-seasoned chicken skin (you know, with my chicken meat). The chicken skin that was on this banh mi was too crunchy and soaked with oil ... it tasted like it had been re-fried with oil. The oil flavor was just too intense, and in my opinion there was simply too much of the skin. I feel like regular shredded chicken or pork would have been great with the rest of the flavors of the banh mi.  I'm not weighting the specific experience we had with Provision too heavily towards this rating, though, since it's only one of the four restaurants being incubated, and the selection of restaurants will rotate.

I look forward to returning to Smallman Galley to try some of the other food. Probably during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Go to a restaurant where you're taken care of and not where you're doing all the running around.
The only reason for 3 stars instead of 1.5 is because the food is quite good, especially the Bahn Mi from \"Provisions\" and the burger is outstanding.  Other than that, their system is just ridiculous and confusing. 
You need to pay at each restaurant and there's no free-flow or continuity within the group of restaurants like where you pay at the end for all sorts and varieties offered.  
In other word it's too much work and, Hey if I wanted to work and do all the running I'd stay home and cook my own meal.
Your wallet is out all the time...Since you have to pay at each restaurant it's just a bad business model.  
The whole point is to enjoy something from each place... With your wallet constantly out it just doesn't work!! You tend to stick to 1 place and so the other stands/restaurants get the shaft. And this is if you're staying IN to eat!  (I could understand this for take-out... But otherwise it's ridiculous).  I can't see this lasting long. 
The menus are hard to read, you don't have time to figure things out if it's crowded, you better know what you want (and you see most people squinting and trying to make it out) and keep an eye on how many people you're give your cc to.. 
Total disappointment! 
If they need to explain how to get a meal.. DOESN'T WORK! It's stupid."}
{"text":"Had the pho... i asked for tofu, got 2 pieces... the broth is overly saturated by clove flavor and cilantro. too heavy. other than that, good"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!! My three friends and I got the following and were stufffffedddd.

Iron Born- White pie
Colonia- Pupusa with beans
Banhmilicious- Rice with chicken
brunoise- Chorizo mac and cheese, Smores dessert

You order at each of the stands and they give you a number. You find a seat, leave the number on your table, and the wait staff brings your food to your seat. We ordered from all four of the stands and everything came out about the same time! Everything was delicious, but the mac and cheese and smores from brunoise were to die for. Ive never seen a Smores dessert deconstructed like that! It was definitely unique and I was not expecting that kind of dessert- in a good way. It was pretty packed arnd dinner time on Saturday, but wasnt too hard to find seats. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is solely for the bar.  We were there for a cocktail competition. We got there early, so started with some house cocktails (from the menu).  They were barely drinkable they were so bad.  Decided to try an old fashioned after that - not on the menu, but standard bar fare.  It was sickly sweet. What a waste of good bourbon.  Then the cocktail competition - WOW were those drinks bad.  Not fair to hold that against this bar, since none of the competitors were in-house, but the house bartenders were bad enough to earn their own 2 stars.

Sorry guys. Love the concept.  Would love to try some of the food, but have yet to see any of the rotating restaurants offer much in the way of vegetarian fare.  Would definitely not return for drinks."}
{"text":"I'm terribly proud to be apart of the innovative and forward-thinking city that conceived this concept. 

Four unique and talented chefs share the same space for 18 months while sharing their gifts with whatever lucky Pittsburghers wander into 2016 Smallman St. 

These great counter-serviced restaurants are accented with a fantastic bar. Local brews on tap & top-notch cocktails. 

My favorite concept was the veggie heavy module of Smallman Galley. I like the chef's approach \"produce of Pittsburgh accented by meat and seafood.\" 

It's the epitome of what the strip is all about -- fresh food, culture, quality materials, and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the buzz is about this place. Honestly it was overpriced food eaten in a cafeteria setting with absolutely no ambiance. Yea, I get it, It's supposed to be a \"concept\" restaurant. If that means order your food and get a text when it is done, you can keep that concept. The quality of the food is average. NEXT!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place; it's a great concept. I wish Pittsburgh had like 5 more of these. The bartenders have been rude on several different occasions for no fault of mine and I'm a people person. I don't like that especially when their drinks can be underwhelming.  I like the rotating local beer selection. Not going to let unhappy servers bring me down. I'll be back."}
{"text":"There is nothing small about Smallman Galley. Even when its jam packed with Yelpers crowding around the bar for a drink it still feels like enough space. Yes, Smallman Galley in the Strip District has an impressive wine and cocktail list but that's not what makes this unique venue so special. When visiting here you're essentially eating at several very different restaurants. Smallman is an incubator for chefs looking for eager mouths to feed. Think of Smallman Galley as a wingman for aspiring restaurateurs introducing them to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Not only are chefs given a platform/venue to feed people they're also prepped with knowledgeable information on branding and running a successful restaurant because all they have is eighteen months to devour this information. After that the next set of chefs are ready for their shot. It's a genius idea as there's enough room for creativity in the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the four current restaurants calling Smallman Galley home and every chef showed up with passion, love for food, and one heck of a menu.

Chef Pete Tolman isn't from Detroit but his pizza is. He saw a hole in the Pittsburgh pizza market and that was the birth of Iron Born Hand Forged Pizza. His food is made to order with the freshest ingredients and although I didn't get the chance to gobble up his pizza (it had pepperonis on the samples) I hear great things about his white pizza. The crust looks insanely flakey. If you can't find a pizza you like on this menu (which is unbelievable) you can always build your own.

Colonia's Chef Jesse Barlass ruined salads for me. I no longer want one unless it's as exciting as Colonia's summer salad. I had just a sample of his pepino and jicama salad and man,  everything worked in such harmony that it sealed the deal for me to come back and try the full menu. And don't think for one minute that you'll get canned beans or store brought tortillas because he makes everything from scratch. The idea of marrying Latin flavors from colonist cultures is brilliant. Barlass definitely knows flavor.

I don't eat beef or pork and the sample Bahmilicious offered was a pho bone broth but that was not a deterrent. Chef Hao Le explained that mostly everything on the menu can be adapted for vegetarian as they have vegan broth. Their most popular item is their build your own pho. You could go safer with something else but no matter what you pick, you'll leave full.

\"Are you sure there's no meat in this risotto Not even the broth?\" I stared at Chef Ryan Peters of Brunoise very weary of his risotto. The flavor was unbelievable and I was just afraid I was eating something that I shouldn't have. He assured me that nothing but love and hours upon hours of care was in the risotto. If the rest of the menu is as flavorful as his risotto, he'll have zero problems opening up his own space. Brunoise specializes in locally sourced fine dining. You can quickly go from a burger to a peanut butter and jelly macaron.

From the outside Smallman Galley isn't nearly as interesting as its chefs and staff that keep the place going. One thing is certain, don't wait too long to give the galley a try because you just might miss out on the beginnings of Pittsburgh's best new restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the idea of four restaurants, each with their own menu, under the same roof. Nice seatng atmosphere to have your meal and maybe get a drink from the bar as well."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place, but honestly was just disappointed with the food. The ambience itself is great and unique. I tried food from the Bahmnalicious place, and everything was underwhelming. I ordered Grassfed Noodle soup, and it lacked flavor completely. I barely finished 1/3rd before gave up completely. The fried egg had no seasoning whatsoever, but hey, that's maybe just how it is. I also tried the Vietnamese coffee which isn't for me. 
My friends who tried other things really liked the food. As for me, the Vietnamese cuisine here is a hard pass. I'm interested in trying the other cuisines though. Oh, also I wasn't happy with the pricing. 15$ for the soup is definitely too high."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love the idea of the place and the variety it offers. Not only are there four different restaurants, there is also a bar and coffee stand! There is a ton of different seating areas including community tables or individual tables. 

From Banhmilicious, we got the banh mi which comes with some bone broth pho, which is PERFECT for dipping the banh mi in. We also got the Funeral Bowl from Colonia which was super good as well! I like that there was such variety in the bowl but I do wish there was a little more meat to go with the beans and rice. Also, if it had some additional sauce on it, but the food itself was flavorful. 

The place is definitely slightly pricey but I feel like it is worth it. Delicious food and there are so many different options for what you feel like getting! 

Hopefully will be back soon."}
{"text":"Standing ovation for Smallman Galley. What a genius concept! Basically, it's a giant food hall with a big, awesome bar, and a long counter separated into four start-up restaurants. 

We arrived on a Friday afternoon, and decided to get drinks first, seats second, food third. The bar was packed already but my husband still obtained our drinks in record time. He came back over to me with a fistful of cash and said the drinks were half-price for happy hour. Steal! 

We grabbed seats in the sunny, large space in the back. The tables are picnic-style so you pretty much sit with others which gives the place a really nice community vibe. We had already decided to hit Iron Born for Detroit-style pizza. I made my purchase and took my number back to our seats. A short wait later, we received our pizzas and salad. The pizzas have six large slices and we were happy to have leftovers later that night back in our hotel room. My only regret is that we ordered two styles that were really similar (the red pie and the spicy pie). If I could go back and do it again I'd do one red one white. In any case, the pizzas were both incredible. The salad... meh. 

I wish we would have had more time to visit Smallman Galley a second time during our short visit. Pittsburgh is filled with gems. This is one I would not miss!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was the week after the refresh with new chefs. We came for breakfast and there were plenty of spaces to sit.

My girlfriend got The Brazilian which was a medium steak with beans and stewed tomatoes. I got the Brazilian breakfast sandwich on cheese bread with an egg and ham. Everything was very good and very filling.

The coffee bar was good as well."}
{"text":"This is a great concept.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the chefs in the test kitchen are great.  They will talk with you if they have time about their style and food, which add a lot to the experience.  The dishes are not all home runs, but that is why the test kitchen exists, to allow the chefs to get feedback and try out some of their ideas before they open up an independent restaurant. 
The bar and coffee baristas are great as well. 

The one big critique that I have is the lay out.  The restaurant feels crowded all the time because of the use of space.  They tried to put large tables in a place that is not necessarily made for them, creating a cramped environment.  So when the Galley does get busy, then there is little room to move.  

Overall, I love this concept and the food here at this restaurant.  My hats off to the chefs that are starting out here.  I hope that Pittsburgh is able to open more places like this that will attract young chefs to the growing food scene."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Smallman Galley. The first was on a Friday night, and it was nearly impossible to find a seat. We were lucky enough to grab two at the bar, which was perfect, as we were able to get drinks very easily.

Our second visit was on a Wednesday evening, around 8:45 PM. After unsuccessfully being served at Gaucho because we arrived a half hour before closing time, this turned out to be a great weeknight option (that's also walking distance from Gaucho). I think many of the kitchens at Smallman Galley close at 9 PM, which gave us more than enough time to decide from the four restaurant options.

This time, we sat in an entirely separate seating area that was less crowded and not as noisy. I like how there are two different sections to sit, depending on what you're in the mood for. We went with burgers from Provision, and they were very good. Love the concept and how casual the entire process is."}
{"text":"Love the concept.  With 4 places to eat it took a while to figure out what I wanted to eat.  Will have to come back and try some of the other chefs.  
A great place for lunch.  Not real crowded and was able to talk with a couple of the chefs for a short time as they were preparing some food for the day.  
I ordered a gnocchi with horse radish and some other fresh items from Carota Cafe.  It was very good.  Really enjoyed. 
The bar had some nice choices of beer too.  Unfortunately, since I had some meetings after lunch had to skip that part."}
{"text":"Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.

The one funny quirk is their delivery of the dish... you order and you desperately try to find a seat.  If you do find one, it is often a comical dash of seeing your food pass you twice because the server cannot see the number on your table.  We've had this happen 5 times and each time, I've had to chase down the confused person.  Seeing how most of the time it is the chef delivering it, I feel bad as they shouldn't be walking frantically to find this tiny number.  

I've tried items from Brunoise, Iron Born, and Bahnmilicious and have rated them individually in their respective yelp profiles.  Overall, I would say that Iron Born and Brunoise stand out in a good way and I can see them being quite successful.

Brunoise - refined food with visually appealing plating that draws your attention.  It seems odd to see such pretty plates come out such an industrial and hipster place but I really wish I tried more plates than what I did here.  What I did try though was quite delicious and very well priced.  4/5

Iron Born - This is really good pan pizza... I'm not sure what makes Detroit style different from my nostalgia pan pizza but it hit all the right spots.  Crusty edges giving way to a fluffy well cooked and flavourful bread that cradled a lot of flavourful toppings.  We go the spicy pizza and the unique addition of the spicy honey made it stand out.  4/5

Banhmilicious - I want to give this a chance and wanted something lighter so the summer rolls seemed ideal.  Unfortunately it was bland and compared to the Iron Born Pizza, it didnt seem to give the same weight as a good meal.  3/5

I do have to commend the staff here as they are hustling and constantly cleaning.  There is a decent amount of tables but on a Friday evening, I felt that it was so hard to get a single table... we saw a lot of people just chilling and not eating.  So for us who just needed two seats for 30 minutes to eat, we were stuck.  Either way, I really wish these chefs a great start, improve with each lesson learned, and become successful."}
{"text":"I regret that I have to write a not-so-good review of the Vietnamese place.  We ordered 2 pho with beef.  $15 each, very high!  I appreciated it was homemade bone broth.  However, I asked them to leave off the Sriracha and jalapeños.  He told me the soup itself was not spicy at all.  WRONG!  It was so spicy, could not eat.  That was without the hot stuff!  I was very disappointed.  Also, too many bean sprouts, yuck.  Meat was kind of balled up, not terrific quality and pretty scant.  Egg rolls were okay, but 3 small for $5 was a bit steep.  $15 for pho was 2x overpriced.  Overall poor impression, wish we would have tried the other vendors there."}
{"text":"I love smallman galley. I have been here several times. The food selections are amazing. I like the fact that the venue changes cooks/restaurant concepts after a certain time period. Nice way for new chefs and potential restaurants to try out their menus. The last amazing tasting thing that I got from here was Iron born which serves Detroit style pizza. This place is like a trendy upscale cafeteria like setting with community like tables but waitresses and waiters around to pour you water. They also have a bar. This is where I drank my first old fashioned drink which has become my new signature drink I order."}
{"text":"Amazing concept and love the chicken thighs from Colonia, smores from Brunoise and spicy pie from iron born."}
{"text":"Great good!  I've met friends for dinner and drinks many times over the last few months.  It does get busy but we always find a place to sit."}
{"text":"While the concept of Smallman Galley is not new in some cities, it's a breathe of fresh air to the brunch scene in the Pittsburgh Strip District.  The basics are this:  4 restaurants, you order, they deliver, water is free...but the full bar is better.  And the food is creative, fresh, local, and inspiring.  My brunch favorites from each of the establishments:  Josephine's Toast:  Smashed Avocado Toast with flax seed, olive oil, and cilantro + egg.  Aubergine Bistro: pork belly omelette.  Carota Cafe: squash or zucchini grilled cheese...with an egg of course and Provision...get the fries.  You won't be sorry.  It can get a little loud in there...but it's a sign of hard working chefs and patrons who are enjoying themselves enough to sit back and relax...you won't be disappointed at the Galley...you're greatest struggle will absolutely be deciding what to order...because you'll want it ALL!

My only disclaimer...while I've brunched here more times than I can count, I haven't yet made it in for dinner...so I'll update soon!"}
{"text":"I FINALLY after over a year of trying - got to go to Smallman Galley!  I was bummed to miss the first set of chefs, but the second set did not disappoint.  We only went to 2 out of the 4 restaurant concepts - Iron Born and Banhmilicious - so this is only on those 2 concepts.

I had spoken to a friend that is a frequent visitor and she gave me instructions on how best to order/sit/etc.  When we first walked in we got our drinks (per instructions).  It was perfect - the bar was pretty busy - but we got waited on quickly and our drinks were scrumptious!

Off we went next to claim a seat.  I set my coat down - since there was only 2 of us - the coat worked for both of the seats we wanted.  If they were packed - it would be harder to claim seats while dealing with the menus.  

After seat claiming we began the restaurant menu review/discussion.  We settled on   egg rolls, summer rolls and Bahn Mi Sliders from Bahnmilicious and the specialty pIzza (mushrooms!) and chicken wings (sweet and tangy)  from Iron Born.

Every single morsel of food was delicious.  My friend wasn't the biggest fan of the sliders because they were messy.  But personally - I loved them.  I would go back to both restaurants for the same meals over and over.  My favorite item was the pizza.  It was SO good - and SO good as leftovers.  My friends favorite was the wings - these things were beautiful.  They were juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside - they were so good.

Do I recommend Smallman?  Yes.  Although - personally - I might get food to go next time - especially in the summer.  The circulation of air is not ideal.  But - if you think about it - there are 4 restaurants pumping heat out - so it being a little toasty is acceptable.  I really appreciated that they have water and glasses at all the tables.  

We weren't sure if we were supposed to tip.  We had tipped at the restaurants - but those folks cleaning off the tables were working their bums off.  So we left a tip on the table too (that they hopefully got!) as it was well deserved!"}
{"text":"Located in the Strip, Smallman Galley is a great place to take friends. Everyone can find an option that they like between the four restaurants. It was a bit overwhelming at first to decide if I wanted pizza, Latin American, Vietnamese, or American food. My friend and I ended up going with iron born. Their pizzas looked amazing. We got the fungi pizza and garlic chill wings to split. It was quite busy on Friday night, but there was still room. 

Wow, the pizza was phenomenal. The dough was amazing, dense, but not too heavy. The mushrooms, herbs, cheese, and demi glaze were a delightful combination. It was a nice change from the typical pizza here in Pittsburgh. The wings were also good, but could have used some more flavor. I was expecting more of a kick from the garlic chilli sauce. Overall, a great concept to bring people back as I would like to try the other restaurants."}
{"text":"It really depends on what you're looking for in a restaurant- the set up is very novel. However, there are no reservations, waiters don't take your order, and the seating is communal (meaning first come, mostly self-serve and with everyone else). The food is good, but a bit rushed during busy times. And since you order at a register, if your friends are ordering at the other lines, the food will come out at different times. I love the exposed brick and industrial look. The place is casual- great if you're looking for a bite and hangout but not so much for a sit-down."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I want to go here every night of the week! A group of 5 of us went here on a Thursday night, we were lucky enough to find a vacant table immediately - most others appeared to have to wait, and the majority is shared seating. The atmosphere is pretty trendy/hipster, casual, and busy. You could honestly walk right past this place without seeing it, but I swear it's a beautiful world in there!

Between us we had 4 pizzas from Iron Born: Hand Forged Pizza and all left with bellies full of literal deep-dish heaven. We all couldn't stop talking about just how incredible it was and how fast it was ready!

We also took advantage of happy hour, (5-7pm Tue-Fri) 50% off any drink!!!! With a great selection!

I know that the restaurants rotate, but I'm hoping to get back to SG before the others change, because everyone's dishes looked sooooo good!"}
{"text":"An awesome spot if you and your friends can't decide what you feel like having. Lots of options from different chefs - and most are very interesting choices you've probably never had anywhere else. I also love the coffee bar! My only complaint is the seating. It's usually a headache to find somewhere to sit especially if you have a bigger group. You'll probably overlook that here though because your food will be bomb! I look forward to the change in chefs and some new, yummy things to try."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great concept. I love that you walk in and have four different venues to order from. The food that I've had here is delicious (I forget the name of the vendor I've gone to, but its the healthy option that is very vegetarian-friendly). The kale and egg dish and the egg white frittata that I've tried were both yummy. Portions were just right. The decor is beautiful and rustic; location in the Strip is great and convenient (except for parking, maybe). Just a heads up, it gets really busy during typical brunch hours!"}
{"text":"I've been to Smallman Galley about a half a dozen times and the food has been excellent every time. My biggest complaint is the set up and the confusion around ordering. Obviously, but the sixth time I was a pro, but you can see many people wandering around not quite getting the concept and no one there to direct or explain it to them. I'd highly recommend going."}
{"text":"This review is simply for the bar. I can't wait to try food here sometime, but alas...

Came here on a Thursday for happy hour not knowing what to expect. The ambiance is rustic- with metal, wood, and brick. The bar was decent sized and I was lucky to find a spot, as it was filling up quickly. Sat down and waited a couple minutes and was eventually waited on. 

One of the amazing things about the bar is they have a TON of local beers on draft. So if you're all about supporting local, this is your place. I ended up ordering a mixed drink, because the special is half off all beer, wine, and cocktails from 5-7, so it ended up being only $5. It was decently strong, and very tasty. I only had time for one drink, but you really can't beat that deal. Overall it's a great spot to catch up with a friend, and I'm excited to go back sometime."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for a late dinner and drinks. The place was packed but the lines were not as long as I expected. Four of us got a seat right away. I got the white pizza from iron born and it was literally the best pizza I have ever had. My fiancé got the tuna from Colonia and it was also great. The tuna was perfectly seared. Overall, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers such a unique concept to pittsburgh that I wish would have been thought of sooner! The idea of being able to choose from four distinctively different cuisines is so amazing! I've had food from Josephine's Toast (it was good, but for the price was shocked at how little it was and how it wasn't filling) Provision (my personal fave!) and Tartotta. It's open seating plan is nice and it has that modern industrial vibe that Pittsburgh is becoming known for. I love it and can't wait to see who they choose for the next round of chefs!"}
{"text":"My most recent visit to Smallman Gallery was disappointing tho I realize it is a gamble on trying various dishes. I brought my aunt here after an awesome hamachi salad at Provisional so she settled on the fish sammy and I the banh mi there. Unfortunately it seemed that day the chef was heavy handed with the cooking - the albacore in the fish sammy was overcooked that it was rubbery and dry, the side salad was very overdressed, the banh mi was super saucy and the meat in the banh mi had an interesting texture. The side of fries was the only thing we both enjoyed. I'll be back to Smallman Gallery but don't bother with either of these dishes."}
{"text":"It's a interesting spot with very good drinks and a galley of food spots in there. It's like a mini food court if you will. However i didn't like the food choices and the pricing for some of them was too high for such little food. Drinks were great tho"}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star review. I'll start with the pros:

-lots of variety! 4 restaurant menus to choose from! All choices seemed yummy and interesting sounding
-bathroom is surprisingly clean for the amount of traffic through here
-seating areas are varied and not so cramped
-taste of the dishes were great

Cons:
-pricey! Yikes! A tiny little vegan pudding served in a 8oz cup was $6! It was delicious but hubby and I finished in all of 4 bites...
I got a small pork belly sandwich with side salad for $14 and hubby got a ham and egg on sourdough bread for $9
-small portions. I didn't leave hungry or anything but let's just say our plates were CLEAN
-tipping here is uncomfortable and confusing. Okay, so you are basically penalized for using a credit card b/c the screen pops up a a predetermined amount and it's ridiculous: 20%? 25%? 30%? 35%? Are you effing kidding me? People who paid with cash in front of us didn't tip at all and somehow that's acceptable? In this type of DIY establishment, I would probably tip only 10% since the plates are super pricey already and you have to grab your own water, cups, napkins and utensils. My hubby tipped 16% on top of our $30 and we got almost no service except for our food brought out to us from a short distance. I just hated that there was a prompt in there when using your card--it's tacky and unnecessary. 

Would I come back? Well, the hubby really enjoyed it and I would like to try some other options too but I'm not sure I would highly recommend it to others. It's more of a concept rather than a great idea. Sunday brunch time was medium crowded but I read that weekend nights are horrendously crowded."}
{"text":"I went with 2friends.  One had pizza.. delicious.  The other had a jimica salad ... delicious. I had risotto, it was delicious as well.  We all used different restaurants.  At my sharing 3 others also visited the Galley a few days later and each enjoyed their selections as well.

Need I say more.   Oh yes, the drinks are happily priced and excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun and cool! I came here in December 2017, and was really impressed with the creativity and deliciousness of the food, the fun and hip atmosphere, the spaciousness of the place, the quickness of service, the affordability of the food, and that there is something for everyone! It's a great place to go for something new, and when your group doesn't want to stick to just one genre of food. I had the curried chicken and it was incredible. They have a great drinks selection and plenty of space for intimate meals, group parties, and family meals! Finding parking can be a bit of a chore, but that's no big surprise in Pittsburgh. I can't wait to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to come eat & have a drink!!   The variety of food is amazing!!!   Definitely a must visit place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Smallman Galley! Why doesn't every city have a chef incubator? I don't live in Pittsburgh, but luckily one of my best friends does. Every time I am in town to visit I insist on checking out what the chefs at Smallman Galley are cooking up. During my most recent visit I had a very tasty dish of shakshuka and it it all the right spots."}
{"text":"I have been to the Smallman Galley a few times now, and it pains me to write what follows. I initially went to the Yelp Event, and absolutely loved this place. I was very excited to come back and try this place again with my family. When we came back we got a table and everyone split up to choose their own meals. 

I settled on the Chili and Toast, my Fiancee got the Squash Grilled Cheese. My dad had wanted to get the Chicken Pot Pie, but when he went to place his order the guy said he wasn't taking anymore orders at the moment. This was unerstandable to a degree since it was incredibly crowded. So my dad waited a little more than half an hour, he went back up and was again told they weren't taking any  orders. So he went to another station and got Potato Skins. And my mom got Carrot Soup and a salad. 

I thought my chili and toast tasted AMAZING and personally left very happy. But that is unfortunatley not the experience of everyone in my party.My Fiancee's first Squash Grilled Cheese came out extremely burnt, as in all you could taste was the burnt bread. She had to take it back and ask for a new one. They brought out a new one, and were very apologetic. So they do get points for good customer service, but someone looked at that sandwich and still sent it out, which never should have happened. The sandwich was also served with a side of Pickled Celery. Sometimes people try too hard to be creative and it tastes pretty terrible.

My Parents enjoyed what they got, but it just didn't really all seem to flow so smoothly. The bar is probably the best in the city, but it is extremely cramped. Of course to a certain degree being an incubator, they have 18 months to sink or swim. And in that 18 months you are bound to witness some sinking ships."}
{"text":"There's changes in the Galley again and as always all for the better. I will start by saying that Smallman Galley is a training food hall for perceptive chefs so that they can go out and start their own businesses. There are four chefs participating.

In the past two years we saw the original class \"graduate\" end of May 17 and was replaced by a new class. Now in its third year the Galley is doing things a little differently.

Still in the Galley are Iron Born which will be there another year, and Banhmilicious which will be there for another six months. Also, Commonplace coffee and their bar are still in place. Replacing Colonia is Joey's snackplace run by Chef Joey H. from the Vandal in Lawrenceville. Among his offerings are vegetable focused dishes such as a vegetable hummus. He does have meat offerings as well which include what I chose for my lunch today-a lamb kebab with fries and aioli. Chef Joey was very nice and answered any questions I had. He told me some of his offerings can be made gluten free upon request, the customer would need to state it. I ordered my meal, was given a number to take to any table and waited for the food.

This lamb kebab was delicious! The salad along with the fries also were very good as well as the sauce that came with them. Chef Joey came to check on me and I learned that he does go back and forth to the Vandal from time to time.

On to dessert. Replacing Brunoise is Home focusing on comfort food. Home is run by Chefs Phil and Melanie M who came from Sarasota, Fl a few years ago. Chef Phil was one of the original chefs who opened FL 2 over at the Fairmont Hotel in the downtown area. His concept is preparing meals people like to eat at home. Also to give it more of a homelike feel, he plans to start a concept so some of his meals resemble dressed up TV dinners.

I got to ask him about gluten free and vegetarian/vegan options. He has special menus for both so if you fall into one of these categories then be sure to ask because those menus are not written on the chalkboard. He told me his best seller so far is meat and potatoes which consist of short rib ragu, Parmesan gnocchi, and whipped basil.  I decided to try his dessert which was broken cheesecake covered with orange dreamsicle and whipped cream.The flavor will rotate weekly. Next week will be Key Lime pie. I got the jar as soon as I paid for it. It didn't look big but it was rich and creamy. This dessert literally blew me away.

I returned to thank him and definitely will return to try out one of his main dishes or even brunch. All the chefs have a special brunch menu on Sundays. I've tried the other chefs in the Galley and have never been disappointed.

Smallman Galley is a great concept for emerging chefs and am happy to visit them and have a chef inspired meal at a reasonable price. I do want to note that most of Smallman St is currently under construction so parking in that area is limited. You can still enter on both the Smallman St side or the 20th Street side. Located in the heart of the Strip district business district it makes a great launch pad for your shopping needs."}
{"text":"What an awesome concept, Smallman Galley! My boyfriend came back from a trip to Pittsburgh raving about Smallman and the next time we visited we went to Smallman not once but twice in a three day period. The bar stays the same and every 18 months four new restaurant concepts rotate through. The kitchen spaces are TINY and each have impressive menus considering the space they have to work with. One of our visits was just for a drink after breakfast at Pamela's next door but on our other visit our group got ramen, toast, shackshouka, and grits. It might work better for each of the restaurant concepts to have their own yelp page for food and service reviews but since they rotate through I can see why they don't. There were only three people working at each kitchen, I'm sure due to space constraints, but in my experience it left a little lacking in the customer service department. Would love to come back on a future trip and see what future concepts have to offer!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love brunch here. I love dinner here. I love happy hour here. The variety of food options/restaurants paired with the casual atmosphere makes it an ideal place to meet friends, bring visitors, or go with coworkers. The pizza place is incredible, but I also love the chicken and waffles brunch option. There's a rotating large variety of beers on tap -some local options too- and the bartenders are always attentive. Only complaint is that they close very early on Sundays (3pm maybe?!)."}
{"text":"This place is remarkable.  Many options by folks that truly give a darn whether or not you are served a delicious meal.  While not for those looking to be waited on with traditional style, after one visit you will be waiting at your table for delivery of your food with too much salivation.   The Iron Born pizza, Detroit Style, is a personal favorite.  For folks from Pittsburgh it is the slice of pizza you never knew you loved devoutly.  I have been back a few times.  I am always a little surprised at the cost...until I begin to enjoy the circus of flavors in my mouth.  It IS worth it.  The concept is worth it.  The place is brilliant and evolving and a must for locals and visitor alike.  Generally, there are 4 or 5 different mini-restaurant options from Asian to Italian to Americana and beyond.  Go for it.  Your inner Strip District adventurer will thank you."}
{"text":"Good lord, how have I never reviewed Smallman Galley??

I was lucky enough to attend a preview with the PGH Yelp Elite group back before it opened. I immediately fell in love with the concept--an \"incubator\" for up and coming chefs to hone their skills and gain exposure. So cool. The staff seemed very passionate about the project, and the chefs were eager to show us the results of their hard work.

I have been there many times since. The menus often change (both for the food stands and the bar) so there are always new things to try. I love that each of the \"kitchens\" offers fairly different options. Anybody should be able to find something here that will interest them--I definitely recommend taking the time to read all four menus before making any hasty decisions!

The bar does a nice happy hour, and this is a great spot to hang out with friends after work. Being in the strip, it's a little less packed than most of the places in town. It still can get quite busy though, especially on a Friday.

I no longer live in Pittsburgh, and I definitely miss this place! I made sure to stop in a few weeks ago when I was in town visiting."}
{"text":"I was really excited about when I first heard about the spot. Since then I have been there to eat about 10 times so I guess its one of my favorites. I end up there most often during brunch and really recommend it. You have to be in the mood to embrace the non-traditional style of it though. I have witnessed people arguing over table spots while embarrassed parents watch in horror. Try something new every time. Really cool bar menus."}
{"text":"Always a great choice... love the variety!  Seating can be tough, but other than that, it's great all around!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, and people! I think I may be addicted to their Bahn Mi. That sauce is scrum-diddly-umptious. I'd love to try out cocktails at the bar sometime. Smallman is definitely one of my favorite places in the Strip and their employees aren't pretentious like a lot of restaurants hitting the popular foodie scene in da burgh."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting concept, but probably not worth the steep price.

I've come here a 2-3 times now and I love that it gives the option to choose between 3-4 different types of cuisine, but the price point ($12-20) is steep for the portions provided.

It's also hard to give an overall review since I haven't tried all of the stalls, so I might back back and update the review once I go again. The bar does seem pretty cool."}
{"text":"I finally got an opportunity to check out Smallman Galley last night after much anticipation! I had some pretty high expectations due to all the praises I had heard, and this place managed to meet every single one of them. I am officially obsessed.

Smallman Galley completely embodies everything that I love in a bar/restaurant. The atmosphere is outstanding. It's separated into a couple different rooms which provide varying experiences. For example, one room has long family style tables and seems a little more quiet and intimate, while another room includes a long bar and has more of a party feel. The brick walls, wooden shelving, and exposed light bulbs add to the overall hip vibe. With such an enjoyable ambiance, I could see myself spending plenty of time here.

I'm always on the hunt for a great happy hour, and Smallman Galley takes the cake. Every single libation on their menu is half off during happy hour, including full bottles of wine! Need I say more? My friends and I arrived around 6:45 PM on a Tuesday - just in time to sneak in a happy hour drink. I chose the Stargell's Stars cocktail, which includes two different variations of Maggie's Farm rum and some fruit juices. I think this is one of my favorite cocktails that I've ever had, and I'm not exaggerating. Yum! It came handsomely presented in a gimlet glass with a piece of starfruit on top. I would also like to mention that our bartender was fantastic. In spite of how busy she was, she was talkative with us and made our experience a positive one.

I'm going to have to come back to Smallman Galley soon, because there are so many food options that I'm dying to try! I love the restaurant incubator idea - the only issue with it is that it's so hard to choose! We shared the cheese and toast plate from Josephine's Toast which was delicious. We especially loved the sauces that were included. I also tasted the Provision fries as well as the kielbasa. I have nothing bad to say about any dish I tasted. The menu at each establishment is innovative and unlike anything I've seen before. You won't just enjoy the food here - it'll knock your socks off.

In conclusion: it's worth the hype, people."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 15 people. We did not expect it to be so packed, ended up scattered around the restaurant. But, the food was delicious, modern and unique. I would recommend this place if your party is 2-4 people and if you dont mind having your food standing."}
{"text":"I've come here twice to sample the new round of restaurants and have been blown away by the iron born pizza. I've had both the white pizza and brunch pizza and both were phenomenal. The crust is fluffy yet crispy on the bottom, with crunchy bits of cheese all around. A little pricier than what I would usually pay for pizza, but completely worth it.  Both times the Vietnamese restaurant left me a bit disappointed. The bahn mi didn't have much flavor to it and was quite sparse with the toppings. The Vietnamese brunch with Chinese sausage, rice, and an egg also lacked flavor. I'll definitely be back, but for the delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"So happy to see this type of concept in Pittsburgh! I  like going to places like Smallman Galley with a group because you have a good chance of everyone getting something they'll enjoy. 

Between our group, we tried Provision: Provision fries topped with lentils and goat cheese; and Hog & Chick, a roasted pork belly sandwich. We also tried Carota: chicken hash; savory Dutch baby; and a chocolate babkin. The food came out quickly and I was surprised by how easily the servers were able to find everyone's tables. 

Overall the food was pretty good. I don't think I would get the the Provision fries again and the chicken hash from Carota had too much oil, but I would try other dishes. The desserts on the other end of the building sounded fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love this idea of different chefs in one restaurant. I've been to many places like this in Maryland and the DC area, I am very pleased to see one in Pittsburgh. This kind of reminds me of Pittsburgh public market however it is all closer together. I picked flank steak toast from Josephine's toast, it was a bit pricy but it's so delicious!! I really enjoy it. We also got a buttermilk brownie which is just average. I looked around people's food, they all look very sophisticated and yummy. I would definitely come back again to try different chefs."}
{"text":"Favorite brunch. Hands down. 

I love the variety of food (although I always go with the shrimp and grits) and the bartenders are amazing. If you mimosas or a great beer variety on tap (all local as well), this place is where it's at."}
{"text":"The four restaurant in one space is a great concept. I especially like that each chef is there 18 months making for different food experiences.
Walk in and pick your spot, order at counter and food is served. You can eat at the extensive bar, side tables or in the back dining area for community seating at long picnic style tables. The decor of wood, dried flowers and metals makes for a rustic and shabby chic feel; making the dining experience comfortable, laid back and fun. I had a melt with side salad and homemade pickles from Toast and the meal was perfection. Great selection of beers and insanely delicious cocktails.
It gets super busy so be prepared for crowds, conversation, laughter and maybe a bit of a wait. With that said, wait time is minimal even when it's packed.
Awesome all around."}
{"text":"Interesting concept you should try

This restaurant is really multiple pop-ups in the same space.  I would call it a restaurant incubator.  We went on a very cold Saturday night right before New Years Eve.  Because of that, we were fortunate not to have to stand in line, though I suspect on a typical Saturday night there is a bit of a line and open tables are hard to find.  There are four restaurants and two bars to choose from.  We had pizza from Iron Born Pizza and it was fantastic.  Deep dish pizza done right.  The flank steak from Colonia was excellent as was the braised lamb pasta from Brunoise.  I didn't really care for the soup from Brunoise (parsnip, chestnut, & orange) but others in our party enjoyed it.  The vegetarian in our group ordered the \"divorce bowl\" from Colonia which was a rice and beans bowl with other veggies and jalapenos.  It was also excellent.

My only complaint is that neither of the bars had any beer on tap that was  of a lighter, Belgium or American Pilsner style.   I get that bitter IPAs are all the rage, but not everyone likes their beer that way.  Fortunately, the bartender was able to hook me up with a delicious Canadian whiskey I had never tried so all was not lost.

I love this concept since it allows you to try many different options and can accommodate groups where not everyone wants the same style of food."}
{"text":"To say I'm THRILLED about this places existence is an understatement. To see four different chefs testing out their planned business right in front of you is so exciting!

Not sure what I'm talking about? Well, these four chefs have 18 months to make it or break it. Once those 18 months are up, hopefully they will have built their biz enough so that they can have their own brick and mortar restaurant.

Honestly, I don't know how any of the four wouldn't have a great chance with the excellent food I've tried. And believe, I've tried them all!

Provision's gastro pub style burger and double fried fries are incredible. I love the vegetable forward vibe of Carota Cafe and will have dreams about their squash grilled cheese. Aubergine rocked my world with a fried rice dish and local maple glazed ham. Finally, Josephine's Toast is everything you want in bread, plus delicious additions, like mussels in a tasty broth you can dip your toast in!

Haven't convinced you already to head there? Well then belly up to the bar for an excellent array of cocktails (love the \"to the five boroughs\") and a great craft beer list. 

It's cafeteria style and very large inside, so no need to worry about reservations or snagging a seat. Get yourself to here for a really unique experience and amazing food and drink to boot!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! (I would prefer to give it 4.75 stars.) The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I think they need to employ food runners--most especially during their busiest times. It would speed up the process and allow for better flow at the counter. Otherwise--this place is amazing. Aubergine's chicken pot pie was delicious (my meal) and my husband loved his scallops. Great atmosphere, amazing concept and the bar is fantastic too! The place was hopping and I didn't see a disappointed face anywhere! Lots of unique and delicious food choices from 4 fantastic chefs. Love it--can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Smallman Galley a few times and have had an amazing meal each time! It never disappoints. My boyfriend loves the burger place the best, but I am impartial as they all are amazing! We enjoy taking people here who are picky eaters, or if we aren't really sure what we're all in the mood for - as the variety is pretty vast. The concept is wonderful, the food is great, the people are nice, it's just wonderful. The only downside is that seating is first come first serve and can sometimes be hard to find, but all in all it's a great, unique place to dine. Think fast food meets fine dining."}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my underwhelming, bananas-crowded first visit when half the restaurants were sold out of food, and have only had good experiences since. Pittsburgh needs more innovative restaurants and businesses like Smallman, which is a restaurant-incubator with three \"separate\" restaurants inside with a shared bar and dining space.  I'm really looking forward to trying the new restaurants when they switch out!  Also attended a lovely wedding reception here.  Check out their amazing happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"It's been our favorite lunch spot in Pittsburgh for awhile. We love everything about it, the concept , the service, the atmosphere... Especially I would like to mention The Aubergine. The flavors and the quality I food here is exceptional , 5+ stars. All menu offerings are so innovative, balanced and enjoyable. Very much recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The poached egg at the Colonia Brunch has a bit of heat, for those sensitive to the spiciness.  Although, it really is a bite to try, even if you're going to sweat a bit."}
{"text":"The Philly cheesesteak pizza was not that good. We ordered extra beed and it came it normal. But than the waitress brought us extra beef which was nice. But it was so hard. The crust was burnt and my cousin was using them at drumsticks!"}
{"text":"Super innovative way to overcome the issues of the food truck industry. The space has a gastropub vibe and a large room dedicated to sit down dining as well as another room for community tables and a large antique bar. There are four chef stations allowing you to choose dishes from a variety of artfully crafted dishes without leaving the single enclosed establishment. Simply leave your name and number with the chef station and they will text you when your food is ready. The bar has craft cocktails created by each chef to match their individual dishes. Bit of expert advice, although its an exciting concept don't feel obligated to try everything. Some stuff is more palatable and other is just too adventurous for everyone. Thats ok! Find one thing you like it's not tapas dining! The best part is the entire place works as an incubator so the better a single chef does within the 8 weeks they set up shop the more likely they are to get help from the organization to start a restaurant. WELCOME TO FOODIE HEAVIN.  I can't wait to see how this impacts the community. Go out and support, home townies, out of townies, doesn't matter! Just go!"}
{"text":"Great place. Cool concept. Convenient location. Good food and quick service. Lots of options! My complaints though are with the temperature in there! It was very hot and no airflow. Almost intolerable! Also..  there isn't much space to move around. The glasses we had for water were hot to the touch, which made our water warm. No ice to help. It was very busy and difficult to find a seat, and this was 7:30 pm on a Wednesday! I would recommend going on a cooler day during off hours."}
{"text":"Brunch, lunch or dinner, Smallman Galley's got you covered. The four unique restaurants offer an array of food to suit every palette, including a vegetarian's. Focus on a single kitchen or try a plate from each and share away. If it's happy hour you're after, you will not be disappointed by the beer selection...but, if it's some morning coffee the adjacent coffee bar will leave a bad taste in your mouth. $3 for two sips of \"for here\" coffee and then $1+ for a refill?! Get it to go to make it a little less ridiculous. Sit at the long communal high top or go it alone and enjoy -- the next round of talented chefs will be rotated in soon. Either way, there is a hub o' activity because all the cool kids are here!"}
{"text":"Great concept....great choices...great food and solid beer selection.  

Couple of things could be improved.  Salt and Pepper at the table would help. While I understand you want to present your meal a certain everyone's tastes are slightly different. My avocado toast could have used a bit more salt.  This should be at my discretion. 

The second counter appears to be only vegetarian even though it isn't.  I made the mistake of assuming that at first but when revisiting the menus I noticed octopus and jumped on it. However 2 others in my party write it off immediately.  May want to revisit that from a clarity standpoint. 

Overall great food...a bit pricey..but fantastic food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and drinks. It's 5 resurants and a bar. 

The bar is where I start. If you want a finely made handcrafted cocktail this is the place for you. I suggest the Boston Sour as it is my favorite drink to have here.

Iron born pizza should be on a best of Pittsburgh list. Deep dish pizza crunchy, chewy delicious crust. Innovative toppings and sauce options. The mushroom pie is my favorite. The main problem with Iron born is that it's soooo good it's hard to pick an offering from the other options.

The next restaurant is Colonia, with a menu of dishes from Latin America. I have had the Pupusas, stuffed corn tortillas topped with slaw. It was better than the Pupusas I've had in other restaurants. I hope to try their other options soon.

Banhmilicious is a Vietnamese restaurant that has a beautiful bone broth. I could drink it by the glass. They have pho and banh mi also.

Brunoise is a French option I have not tried but the risotto looked really good."}
{"text":"Excellent space set up for differing tastes. Went there for Sunday brunch and had some amazing food from el lugar and provision. Food at both places was amazing and tasty. Chorizo omelette and potatoes was bomb. Coffee at the bar was excellent . Draft list was solid and had some tasty choices."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to check this place out and it exceeded my expectations. What a unique and awesome concept! The set up and vibe is so great. The central bar is beautiful with a coffee bar/station at the end. The lights, brick, tables and little details all just come together to make you want to hang out and try everything. 

I will say, that the food selection is ... Different. Out of the four restaurant options I'd say I was drawn to Provisions the most. They had a lot of gluten free options and I had their fries which were laying on puréed squash and covered in Lentils and sour cream. Also I had their chicken tostadas. Both very flavorful and delicious. I wouldn't say however that i'd rush back for any of the food in particular. I'm looking forward to going back for the good drink selection and the atmosphere. 

I'm excited to see such a cool, new idea implemented in the city for another fun dining option."}
{"text":"Love the concept of a restaurant incubator, with 4 chef stations to choose from.. Went for Sunday brunch here.. As a vegetarian, I'm always restricted in terms of choice.. tried the Horseradish gnocchi based on other reviews, and it lived up to the expectations. Looking forward to trying it for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Finally...I got to eat here. Out of many options, I went for white pie since it is vegetarian and many people who were having lunch at the time we went were having pie. So, I went for the popular choice and I am glad I did that.

It is very delicious and I am not sure what they topped it off with. But it seemed to be a mix of cheese and mashed potatoes. I loved the pie and it is neither too heavy nor too light. Just the right amount for two people. 

My friends ordered curry and noodle soup from the Vietnamese restaurant. The curry was good but my friend didnot like the noodle soup and felt like it is over priced for the taste and quality. 

Overall, I highly recommend the pie if you are here."}
