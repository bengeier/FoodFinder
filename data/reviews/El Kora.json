{"text":"The most common complaint that I see when it comes to a Mariscos restaurant is the noise.  Which I have no issue with because I enjoy some good Mexican music.    As far as the food, it is pretty good and the seafood always taste fresh.  I usually get the coctel \"Kora\" which is their signature Mexican cocktail, has pretty much all the seafood you can think of!  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great time. Excellent service out waitress checked on us regularly. Love music awesome!!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food.... service is crappy unless your a rich man, waitresses not very attentive"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Fried shrimp was awesome. Banda was loud and exciting. I went on a Sunday night around 8 and it was packed and the atmosphere was fun. More like a party that night than a restaurant. It can get pretty crazy at this spot. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay! Not to happy with the service, waitress messed up on the order and made us pay more.  They only take cash so you will need to take money out from their ATM machine and pay an additional $2.75 plus bank fees."}
{"text":"First time here , place was almost empty maybe 3 people here . service was terrible she never came to check in on us only took our order , brought it like 40 mins later . it was super cold for it being that late. Never got us refills. Was rude after we told her she never came to check on us. Was extremely attentive to the male customers tho"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I invited My sister and a couple of friends to this place thinking that it was a good choice, because a friend of mine is a musician there and the service was terrible. I had asked for a Michelada and the waiter took about 30 minutes to get it to Me and only because I asked them how long more it was gonna take. Than I asked the waitress how long My food was gonna take if I order and she responded with \"We are too busy to let you know\" isn't that a good thing for them to have better service? At the end of the service the waitress gives us our bill and than responds with. They don't take cards on the weekends, when the table next to Me says that they did pay with their card. I will never go back to that place again."}
{"text":"I was craving some shrimp tacos like the ones we have in L.A. and saw this place. The main reason I went was because of the drive thru. I ordered 2 of the shrimp tacos and was not what I wanted. They even charged me for the avocado..Don't get me started with how long I had to wait for my food..it was like 20 mins. Will not come here ever, I'll wait till I'm in L.A."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly and frequently checked up on us to make sure nothing was missing the food was great and the live music really put on a great vibe love it here !! I"}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good. They also serve a little  cup of clam soup at the beginning of your meal...reminds me of a manhattan clam chowder.  This place is super popular and they also serve mini bud lights for $1  ( sidenote: I had never seen those minis unless I was with my Mexican friends). It can get a little loud and it appears that they only hire \"sexy\" waitresses.  It definitely feels like a little place in Baja"}
{"text":"I usually never like to comment bad reviews but honestly where can I start with so my cousin and I went to eat there and the waitress was so rude when we got there they took like 30 minuets to bring our food and I guess it's because we're girls they don't come to see if we need anything else that day there was a few people in the restaurant and they took forever to bring our check to the table but very very disappointed I honestly don't think I will be there again the waitress were only very attentive to the men there but will never go there again"}
{"text":"If you love Banda this is the place for you. I am one of them so I love this place already!  They said they have banda everyday and that has been true in every ovation I've visited.  Ambiance is great.  Food is good.  Service is good.  Prices are decent.   Only thing is you have to scream over the banda to place your order."}
{"text":"Pretty trashy place. Stay away if your out of town looking for some good authentic Mexican seafood. They have live music unless your here just to drink other than that it's not that edible. All seafood is under seasoned and tasteless. Prices do not reflect quality or taste, go somewhere else!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru service . Im about to throw a rock at the window. They just keep starring but they don't take our order. Im typing this as we wait.   Well now that we have started to place our order, we weren't  even done when the lady closed the window on us !!!!!!   It may just be the pregnancy hormones !!! But ugh!!!! Never again!!!! I don't  even want to give it one star. It doesn't  deserve it. The food will probably be good since we've ate here before but the service today has been horrible."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The waitresses are relatively friendly. The only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star rating is the super loud music, I understand it's live but should it really be so loud that I can't hear the person next to me yell? I guess some people enjoy that. But overall, AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Worst service of my life. To sum it all up, waited an hour to find out our order was never placed and we still got charged full price."}
{"text":"The food is disappointing  and I use to go many times but because of the food change idk if they change cook or what. The service last time I went was not the best the waitress was rude and was trying to hurry us up to leave. The only good thing there is the live Banda music and the beer other then that it sucks!"}
{"text":"Really good food and yes- really pretty waitresses!  Invited here by a contractor after completing a job- probably not a lot of gringo's like me going through the doors, but I found out I was missing out.  Like this place a lot, the hustle, the volume, total atmosphere- very friendly.  Never once felt out of place.  Had a shrimp tostada that was very \"cool\" on a warm day- refreshing. Could eat that starter clam soup all day long though!  Also had my first Michelada- think I might be hooked on that!  Great with Pacifico.  Place reminds me a lot of my younger years in El Paso.  Too bad the staff had to put up with my seriously lacking Spanish- but they weren't too hard on me.  Definitely want to go back again for some fresh mariscos dishes- maybe help some friends discover this place too, who may not otherwise venture in.    Try it for some really fresh sea food, Mexican style.  Close your eyes and imagine the beach right outside.  That's the feel."}
{"text":"Buenísima la comida mexicana pero demasiado alta la música .es como salir lleno pero con dolor de oído ."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food for a late night on the run, or for lunch.  I prefer the carne asada quesadilla and a coke, but that is my fix at most dive Mexican food places such as this.  The prices have gone up since they moved from McDowell Rd., but they are still very reasonable and still serve good portions.    It's like many Mexican food trucks...you better know what you want when you go to order or you may be ignored.  I prefer to take it to go as there is very limited seating and it is a food truck so it is outdoor, which in summer means HOT.  Give this place a chance if you're in the area and like the hole-in-the-wall feel (or no walls in this case!)."}
{"text":"Have been to this place many, many time sad to say this was my last time here. Dont want to blame our waitress in anyway she did her job well & served our table in an excellent way. But this time some how a FLY was in my beans....totally ruined everyones appetite....looks like they care more about the $$$$"}
