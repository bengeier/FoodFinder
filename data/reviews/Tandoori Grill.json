{"text":"Me and my boyfriend live on the same block and we have to stop ourselves from going there every day. The food and service are amazing!!! It is homemade Indian food full of flavour and made fresh. The owners are lovely people and every time we go there we love spending sometime just chatting with them."}
{"text":"Found this eatery through Yelp - Thought we would give it a a try based on the reviews. Amazing customer service -  friendly, courteous & very helpful in assisting us with the menu selection. Food was great too. The naan is one the best we've tried, really fresh & hot. Even though we were stuffed we ordered a garlic-cilantro naan to go ....glad we did, sheer bliss :-)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Lunch specials are so good and a great price. I order dinner from here about once a week and I've never had a bad experience. Food is fairly quick, decent price, and excellent quality. Paneer pakora and malai kafta are my favourites.   Check it out."}
{"text":"Like one of the other reviewers, I was thrilled to see a new option for Indian pop up in the neighbourhood.  I was probably one of the first customers...they were still a little unorganized.  But WOW! That was amazing food!!! The spicing was heavenly. The dishes - each one was high quality and delicious.  I thought the weird way the butter chicken came in a small portion with salad was a tacky marketing trick, but no matter, the food was amazing. This place quickly became our favourite takeout.  Why my 3 stars? Because in a very short amount of time, things seem to have changed for the worse.  The serving size has shrunk significantly - and I would be ok with that as this is expensive food to make- but what bothers me is that the consistency has turned to soup. The butter chicken had about six tiny pieces of meat and then a watery sauce that would not even hold to the rice. Every thing is still quite flavourful, but very much a liquid - even the vegetable dishes. The lamb dish had too many fat chunks for my taste.  The naan had turned a bit greasy, and although we only ordered 2, we seem to have received enough for an army - at least six pieces. Our meat samosas were vegetable. The rice is way too expensive...I've always thought the rice should be free.   I will try Tandoori Grill again in six months or so and see if they've found their groove."}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall. The veggie pakoras were excellent, best I've had in a long time.   Perfect restaurant for a cheap weeknight meal. Paid about $25 for my wife and I for dinner, and had enough leftover for lunch for both of us. We will be back."}
{"text":"Had 2 good experiences there so far.  The food was yummy and the service was friendly.  I'm disappointed in the recent negative review.  I hope the folks at Tandoori Grill are monitoring their reviews here so they can make any adjustments.  It's a good idea, and a good location.   Also want to point out that every Indian restaurant thinks they have to have a buffet for lunch.  Sometimes we don't want buffet - we just want a couple little things & some naan.  This place fills that bill!  The last time I was there, I got their takeout lunch special for $10 - two dishes, rice, and naan."}
{"text":"Our go to place for indian food. We love the staff here - always smiling and friendly, and willing to answer any questions about the food. Love that this is within walking distance to our place, so we can save a little on delivery charges.   The butter chicken is my go to and it is always unreal. Fish vindaloo and veggie samosas are also a go to in our household and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst east Indian food I've ever tried to eat. The naan bread was dripping in oil and the butter chicken tasted like someone added dark meat chunks to a can of cambell's tomatoe soup. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Was in airport hotel from out of town.  They charged me $16 just for delivery.  On top of it the chicken tikka masala was below average, the naan tasted horrible, and the desert was probably the worst I have ever had.  I normally am very generous on the reviews but this place is horrible."}
{"text":"Food was average. Price was outrageous. I ordered one chicken curry meal for delivery and my total came out to $24! They did not confirm price over the phone and menu prices stated otherwise. Was very disappointed from that aspect."}
{"text":"Delicious! I popped in on Friday night and asked the lovely young woman behind the counter what's for dinner. She suggested the Biryani. I also ordered a side of Naan. $15 and a few minutes later, I headed home. Both were delicious. The naan was chewy and delicious, right out of the tandoori oven. The Biryani was spicy and flavorful, with plenty of juicy chicken pieces. I'll have enough left for lunch. This would easily feed 2 ppl."}
{"text":"had a wonderful meal - very fast and friendly service. highly recommended  all food is prepared when you order and delivered to you piping hot and tasty. you have never had Naan any fresher! seasoning is perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. The food was tasty and flavourful, although the meat in the dishes was very limited than you'd expect. The price was higher than what would be reasonable.  I'd probably not go again but I could just be too picky. In any case, not for dine in."}
{"text":"Not too shabby and pretty good value.   Our house ordered takeout from here: lamb korma, vegetable curry, chicken biryani, and garlic naan. $45 for the set after tax, which ain't bad at all (actually $36 since we used a JustEat coupon for 20% off!). Portions were hefty (except maybe the lamb in the korma) and justified pricing IMO.   Quality-wise, it won't be the best Indian food you've ever eaten, but it hits the spots that need to be hit when you're hankering for Indian. Chicken biryani was reasonably flavourful and quite plentiful, lamb korma was fairly well made, and vegetable curry had a nice sauce and filled to the brim with veggies (but seemed like they may have used a package of frozen peas/carrots/corn? Hmmm). Nothing was especially impressive (though the vegetable curry sauce was quite decent!), but it fit the bill.   Overall, I'm into it. A good go-to takeout place for that hole in your heart/stomach that needs to be filled without bleeding out of the wallet. Will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my friends suggested we have lunch here and I'm so happy we did! Right on 14th st SW, most people would probably just drive on by. I'm saying stop on in for a visit because the food is really good and the owner is super nice.   We each ordered the Lunch Box and at $10.95, it was a steal! It comes with the four daily curries, rice, naan, and a bonus item. Today, the bonus was pakoras. When I asked for hot sauce (which you should all try IMHO), they mixed up a special sauce \"so that it will blend easier with the curry\"...and it was warm! No spooning it out of a jar here folks.  The naan, which for me is a forbidden pleasure, was soooo worth it. It was beautiful! I will certainly be back with more friends! They don't have the largest seating area at the moment, so I plan on owning the room :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have ever had. It is authentic and very tasty! I recommend everyone should give this a try. It's perfect for to-go food after a busy day and you want to treat yourself to the delicious cooking of someone else.   The owners are also very nice, welcoming, and they no doubt want you to enjoy your stay, your order, and your experience.   Do try - LOVED it!"}
{"text":"My new favourite go-to for Indian food! Amazing food and great service. I recently made a big order for a bunch of us nurses. The owners were wonderful and accomodating. The food... OMG the food is delicious!! We ordered pakoras, masalas, vindaloos, paneer and butter chicken and we loved everything!! We ordered one hot BC and one mild. The \"hot\" they use is perfect... it doesn't send you panicking BUT the nice warm spices linger in your mouth for awhile. One thing to note: this is primarily a take-out establishment. There are 3 tables in there for very casual dining so break open a bottle of white wine at home and get ready to enjoy everything you order!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And well priced. Fish Tikka Masala- mind blowing. Yummmm Prawn coconut curry- different, mild, tasty Lamb Rogan Josh- soooo tender and tasty Palak Paneer- perfection I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! I just moved to Calgary within this year, and I wish I found this place sooner. I'm in total bliss right now stuffing my face with amazing samosas and super flavourful beef vindaloo with lots of big chunks of meat. The Naan is awesome -- not the best I've had, but it's certainly up there and I still give them 5 stars based on the curry and the samosas alone. The prices are decent for the portions. I likely won't be getting Indian food anywhere else now that I've found Tandoori!"}
{"text":"I would say the best Indian food I've had in Calgary. The tandoori chicken is divine, tender, fresh - just delicious. The lamb dish, nan and rice were also very good. Plus very friendly service. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Gather round, I'm here to tell the tale of the most bizarre restaurant experience of my life. Granted, we only used Tandoori Grill's services for take-out (thank God!) but after my experience with them, I swore never to set foot in the actual establishment.  We ordered the food rather smoothly. However, the restaurant immediately called back to chastise us for ordering one naan, instead of two. In any case, we waited for one hour and a half for our order. The restaurant is 2 miles away, and restaurant promised our order in 40 minutes. Alas, the food arrived....and it was lukewarm....two dishes we ordered were missing, substituted by two other dishes we did not order.....worst thing? The food was not very good.  After complaining to the owner of the establishment, he agreed to refund us our money. He requested that we box up delivered dishes and he would come by to pick them up...needless to say, as with the rest of his actions, he screwed up this part as well. We waited until 11 PM for him, and after exchanging half-dozen phone calls, it became clear that he got hopelessly lost and increasingly frustrated. So....we never got our refund. The summary? Tandoori Grille got $70 plus tip and delivery for the tasteless food we did not order... and we spent $70 on the inedible meal and a wasted evening dealing with incredibly rude business owner who somehow felt it was our fault we received the wrong order. My advice: 1. Please AVOID Tandoori Grill at all costs. 2. If you absolutely must order froim them....lower your expectations! 3. Check your order before paying delivery guy.... 4. Don't pay cash - they will not refund you the money...despite what they promise We are filing the case with the Better Business Bureau - nobody deserves to be treated this way. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this 3.5 if I could because it's pretty good Indian. The downside is that it's mostly a delivery/take-out operation, and yet is a great option in a pinch. The flavours, texture and quantity are quite good, and the phone and delivery service to your home or hotel is worth it. But somehow eating out of styrofoam or cardboard containers just doesn't compare to eating in where the spices, music and service add to your dining experience. Nonetheless, better than the raft of pretenders out there - mostly buffet joints - most of whom need to disappear off the map."}
{"text":"Despite the mixed reviews, I was too tempted by the garlic naan bread, I'm a sucky for the soft, super dense ones, and TG fits the bill.  Made with real garlic too, as you can see bits of it too, compared to some lazy ones out there who just smear garlic butter.  It's a total takeout place with a few tables just to wait around, wouldn't call it a sit-down resto with your other half.  Corner location.  Friendly service.  amex yay!"}
{"text":"For the price it was the worst East Indian food in Calgary that I have tried so far. I've never known anyone to screw up Tandoori Chicken. My wife does a way better job at it.   And I'm not just complaining because the Beef Vindaloo was very good."}
{"text":"Tandoori Grill is our favourite Indian restaurant in Calgary. We've tried most of their immense menu over the past year (enough that the owner's commented on it), and almost all of the dishes have been delicious. If I were to pick a favourite, it would be the Jaipuri mixed vegetables -- I'm an enthusiastic carnivore, but this dish is so flavourful that I don't miss the meat at all.  They're also not afraid to put a little heat into everything. To pick two examples, at most restaurants veggie samosas and tandoori chicken have no spice to them at all, but here they make them with just enough heat to make our toddler complain. :-)  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here, everything on the menu is mesmerizing to the 'ol tastebuds. Besides the delicious, extensive menu- dining here means feeling comforted by gracious hosts who are genuine, knowledgeable, and eager to please your food cravings! Seriously, don't pass the gem that is Tandoori Grill up."}
{"text":"A new Indian restaurant just opened up across the street from my work and I have been anticipating the day that I can try it since the moment I saw them erect (hehehe, immature right?) their signage. Tandoori Grill! Makes my mouth water just thinking about the spices. However, it took them over 8 months to open the bloody doors from the time I saw the sign posted. Don't play with my appetite like that!  I got around to trying the place out last week as they just opened that weekend. I like my curries as much as the next guy but some co-workers suggested I try the Biryani. So I gave it a shot and ordered a side of butter naan (which is apparently not allowed in the Indian eating playbook. My co-worker described it as eating mashed potatoes with rice - personally I don't see the problem). What I found really unusual is that about two minutes after ordering I got a phone call from an unknown number and it was a lady working at the Tandoori Grill. She called to ask me if I wanted my Biryani medium hot or very hot. I told her to make me sweat and I think she might have misinterpreted me as coming on to her. Chalk it up as an error in translation.  So I'm eating this chicken biryani, right, and it tastes really good! The serving size is quite large for my 5'6\" frame but you'll never hear me complain. There is a lot of chicken and a lot of spice here. Maybe a bit too much spice. I did catch a few cloves and some bark looking thing that tasted really bitter. Minor grievances for me since I do like to experience ethnic and exotic flavours. And boy did she make me sweat! The biryani was spicy too (HAR HAR)! You vanilla faces out there might want to opt for the medium spicy; a caramel face like me has been desensitized to the hot stuff.  I'm looking forward to trying out the curries and tandoori BBQ in the near future. Word on the street is that they will do a lunch buffet so let's keep our fingers crossed that it happens."}
{"text":"I have been hurting for some decent Indian takeaway, ever since my across the street  go to place's food has declined.  So Tandoori Grill opened next to a liquor store on 14th. Booze and Indian food next to one another, AMAZING. I couldn't find a menu online and after begging for help from twitter and still no response, I just called them up.  \"Hi, I don't have a menu, so I am just going to guess at what you have and can you tell me if I can order it or not?\" The friendly lady on the phone was very accommodating and everything I wanted, they could provide me with.  We ordered vegetable samosas, vegetable pakoras, butter chicken, lamb biryani and three plain naan. What I didn't realize is that butter chicken along with lamb chops, tandoori mix platter and shish kabab are chef's specials so they come with a piece of naan already and a salad (I loved everything about Tandoori Grill except that salad is pretty much nonexistent).  I was greeted with all smiles when I arrived to pick up my order, the couple who run the place are very nice. The woman who took my order on the phone remembered I did not have a menu so gave me one and told me it is posted on their facebook page.  We got home and ripped into our meal, and I was very impressed. This ain't no pre made frozen samosas, pakoras or naan. You can tell the naan was made with tender love and care, nice and pillowy, I wanted to take a nap on it. it also wasn;t covered in burned bits, like some naan, which I assume comes from a dirty tandoori oven. The samosas and pakoras were exceptional and very tasty.  The butter chicken was also excellent, I am not a fan of the giant chicken chunks, and this chicken was nicely cut in bite size portions and the sauce was tangy and flavourful. The lamb in the biryani was cooked perfectly, nice and moist.  So those who drive past Tandoori Grill or live in the area and go \"I wonder if it's good?\" It is! and their prices are also good considering other indian restaurants in the area.  I have also taken pictures of the menu and added it for enquiring minds, so go forth hungry patron, go forth and enjoy Tandoori Grill!"}
{"text":"This was the only Indian restaurant I got to try in Calgary and it was beyond expectation. Went in for the lunch box. The naan was really soft and the butter chicken was great!"}
