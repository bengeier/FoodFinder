{"text":"I had tried the chicken shawarma, had better before. I have tried them all this is not the best in sauga. Meat for dry and not very seasoned. I work close by here so i decided to try them out and was very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in a way. It has many negatives to it but the food is quality and you can tell it's homemade. I am an avid shawarma goer. This place is right near my work so I've come here a few times. The lady and gentleman are both very nice. The hot sauce is very tasty and flavorful. The negatives are it's kind of hidden if you don't know where it is. The amount of food you get is very little and the prices steep. I understand you got to pay for quality food but people like a balance between quality and quantity. The chicken shawarma dinner plate is close to $13 I believe after taxes. Not quite a deal when compared to $9 on the rocks at different places which is a lot more food. But they are nice people and food is very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband because of the reviews and it MET our expectations!! We love spicy and it had just the right kick to it. Definitely going back. It's hard to find a good shawarma store that gives you everything.  Oaza did it for us. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Literally everything. Shawarma is go to, love and is impeccable. Id go here for all my shawarmas if it was closer to me. 

Saw one review earlier about \"darker meat\" for chicken and \"frozen fries\" out to fry. Lmao if you've ever had a shawarma from anywhere you know the chicken isn't gonna be white meat that's the point. Shawarma is the kind of meat it is. And almost every shawarma place doesn't fresh cut potatoes, like 95% of them are frozen fries, but if it's cooked right they're good!

10/10 food 10/10 service 9/10 venue"}
{"text":"Car was at the dealer for an oil change, checked Yelp for places near by, saw the two buffet restaurants next door but I decided to go to Oaza's since lunch buffet was most likely done.

Walked in I was greeted very nicely, I ordered a shawarma and fries with drink. The place was clean and had a large cooking area and back kitchen, but the seating was small 2 tables with 5 seats each near the window and a bar styled area with stools. You could tell it was the owner and his son working. The owner seemed focused on giving good customer service and a good shawarma. He showed me the sandwich after he put the sauce to get my approval for quantity. He let me know when he finished wrapping the sandwich he would delay heating it so he could serve it hot with my fries.

The chicken shawarma was spiced lightly but was very tender and the sauces tzaziki, hot sauce, garlic sauce, and hummus nicely complemented the chicken. It left the sandwich with a well rounded flavour. The heated sandwich press left a nice crunch to the pita, overall, chicken shawarma wrap was excellent. Fries were nothing special.

The flyer and menu prices did not match, not sure if the the menu recently changed but nothing on the flyer or menu are the same so realistically flyer should be replaced. The shawarma prices are slightly more expensive then other places but here they do not make it up by putting less chicken."}
{"text":"Checked Yelp for something close by and decided on this, I'm really glad I did. First time here, I just left and I must say it was a great experience.

Service was superb, I met the owner and we had a great conversation while my food was prepared, very friendly and seemed to actually care about quality and my experience. I ordered a chicken shawarma plate but he threw in some beef because I wanted to try it. Everything was fresh including salad and humus and sauces. The shawarma and rice was noticably better than most joints. Only thing that I wasn't impressed by were the fries (generous portion), they weren't bad but they arent great either.

Overall good food, good price, and good service."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work.. And coming here for lunch have been a weekly routine (first discovered while stopping for big bowl in the same plaza) Robert the owner is super friendly, he will tell you his food is fresh and the hot sauce is home made and good. It is all true. Food is tasty, always prepared fresh in front of you. They have recently up their price, so a chicken wrap with fries and a can of pop will cost you around 13 with tax. A bit much in my opinion but no doubt food is good."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken shawarma. I was in the area and decided to try it based in the Yelp reviews. Did not expect much at first as it seemed like a standard dive shawarma place. Owner was very friendly though, great service.

I asked for a spicy shawarma with hot sauce and it was actually surprisingly spicy with real depth of flavour beyond the heat. Very curious to know what's in the blend of the spices added. Hit the spot perfectly. Think this might be my favourite shawarma. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Had a chicken Shawarma and I must say I enjoyed it quite a lot!! There isn't to many shawarma places around Mississauga, but this one is a definite try!! The reason why I would give it a 4 star, is because the price is a bit high for a shawarma this size, as I have had bigger ones, with a lower price."}
{"text":"I was traveling and dropped in after 9 as they were closing.  The owner was nice enough to let me eat it there even though they were closed.  I ordered the beef schwarma plate with the salad and hummus.  Everything was excellent.  Sauces on the schwarma were a perfect blend of flavor and heat.  Next time I'm in town I'll go back for more.  The owner was super nice and gracious."}
{"text":"Good food and everything made to order, I especially enjoyed the hot sauce on my chicken plate, everything was flavorful and well executed.  Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now and have always ordered for take out.

The food is tasty and you see that when they are preparing it they put a nice touch to it. Very glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Good little place with good chicken and beef shawarmas. Might consider trying other things next time I go."}
{"text":"Oaza shawarma is the greatest shawarma place in all of the GTA. Everything is so fresh and wholesome, and the owners are wonderful. The place is very clean and very well maintained, which is something you won't find at any other shawarma place in the GTA. The sauces are all homemade and they're so delicious and very addicting!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Family-run by immigrants from Northern Iraq. It's a brother-sister operation. Tucked away in an unsuspecting plaza in Mississauga among a coin laundry and other run-down shops. 

FOOD: Everything is home-made, from scratch, and prepared just the way the family would prepare the food for their own family (according to the sister). The hummus, tahinis, sauces, meats are all marinated and cooked in-house. 

I ordered a chicken shawarma dinner plate: rice, chicken, side salad, hummus with rose water and spices, and side of grilled crispy pita bread.
And a chicken shawarma sandwich (pita).

The chicken was seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. They drizzle this thousand-island style dressing on top of the chicken that is sensational. A bit on the sweet side, but a nice change from all the garlicky white sauces I am used to (Lazeez, Halal Guys).

Check this place out if you are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I was in the area so I knew I had to come here for lunch. I tried the chicken shawarma on a pita. The owner is super friendly and explained that all his sauces are homemade. The restaurant was clean and sunny. 

The chicken shawarma pita isn't the biggest in length, but it is pretty stuffed full of goodness. If you're super hungry or have a big appetite, you might want to get the combo with fries and a soda. Those with an average appetite or looking for a small meal should be happy with just the sandwich.

I got everything on my pita and the flavours melded really well together. First I thought that the hot sauce was too mild, but it's a building heat. My lips were definitely tingling by the time I finished the sandwich. There was a yummy and slightly unusual seasoning (don't know whether it was the meat or one of the sauces) that just gave a satisfying savoury taste to the sandwich. The veggies were fresh and the meat was juicy.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just ate here, nice and clean place. I had the size hummus and it was really tasty and fresh.

My wife shawarma chicken sandwich and he enjoyed.

We will be back"}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the best Chicken Shawarma I've ever had! The meat looked appetizing and lean on the rotisserie, the sauce's flavour stood out nicely, the veggies and pickles were crunchy and it was packed tightly. Even the pita looked appetizing as the sandwich was prepared. After rolling it up, he put the shawarma into a sandwich press to give it a touch more heat. Heavenly hot sauce too, yumm!
The place is hidden off Dundas in a tiny U shaped strip mall behind a Vietnamese restaurant and has a nice picture window facing the parking lot. There are a couple table/booths to sit in and eat and as well there is a long bar with stools facing the grill area. They even have Coke in bottles, a nice touch. The restaurant looked clean and well taken care of. There were people lined up waiting at lunch time and a few bagged orders on the bar waiting to be picked up. Worth seeking out for your shawarma fix!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner and delicious food! They sell homemade hot sauce (ask for a sample)! I like getting their hummus and baba ganoush to go!"}
{"text":"The BEST Shawarma spot in the city. The owner is amazingly nice and hospitable!

If you're ever in Mississauga, I highly recommend you check it out! They use quality meat and ingredients."}
{"text":"Favorite shawarma place in town. So happy when we are nearby - it's a treat! The restaurant is run by a brother and sister only, and the food is very fresh and so flavorful. Definitely get the chicken shawarma. You won't be disappointed. 

They don't take credit card for less than $25, but will take debit.  

When I was picking up my order there were two regulars and a new guy who proclaimed he was \"definitely coming back\". We usually do takeout, but there are tables and a bar area to sit and eat in if you want. Don't let a lack of people eating in put you off - most are take away orders. You'll be glad no matter which you do."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. We live in the area so thought we would finally give it a shot after seeing some reviews of it on Yelp.

Finding the location was a bit challenging. We had to circle around a couple of times and then finally saw the sign for it. It's behind a few other stores, and it is a fairly small location, so keep your eyes peeled when looking for it.

We ordered 2 chicken shawarma plates, one chicken shawarma sandwich, and one mixed grill. The food took about 10 minutes to get ready for takeout, which is a bit on the longer side considering most shawarma restaurants are \"grab and go\".

In terms of the quality of the food, I wouldn't call this shawarma. It tasted good, but it didn't taste like a shawarma. The meat is seasoned with some spices, which give it different taste than a traditional shawarma sandwich. I did enjoy the food, but I was disappointed in the fact that the taste was drastically different from other places - mainly because they use their own homemade sauces. I give them credit for putting in the effort to make it unique, but I don't think this should be called a \"Shawarma\" shop. More like a \"Middle Eastern\" shop.

Overall, I will still recommend this restaurant to friends, but give them the disclaimer about the taste before they order a shawarma sandwich!"}
{"text":"The best shawarma in all of Toronto and sauga. The shawarma plates with their homemade sauces are amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could review the place higher as they're very friendly and my last visit a few months ago was better.

The rice is indeed seasoned, which is nice, but some lentils would make it even better. I like how they give you a grilled pita along with a platter too. I enjoy pickled turnips, but I found theirs too sour. The hummus did the job, but the creamy sauces were only okay - and almost too much like salad dressing. Excellent hot sauce however.

The disappointment with my last visit however was that the meat - both chicken and beef since I ordered a mixed platter - were not fresh. It really brought the whole thing down. Fair enough, I was there on a Saturday evening which may not be the busiest time, but it would be hard to recommend a place without reservation when there's the risk some periods of time will be better than others.

If the meat was fresh, this place would be an easy 4 star, but perhaps you may want to come at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Small place in a plaza with a laundromat next door.

Friendly service and fresh food.  Falafel was made to order which I consider a big bonus.  Chicken shawarma also fresh off the grill.  Service was friendly.  One of those nice local spots that can easily become a regular spot to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Amazing Shawarma! 

I was blown away by the freshness of the taste.  And the seasoning was incredible.  Everything was cooked to perfection. 

The place is clean, friendly service,  great hours of operation.  

Feels like eating at a friends house.  The owner Robert is friendly.  Felt like I was talking to an uncle. 

Absolutely love this place.  If you like Shawarma you must check this place out."}

# of Visits as of this review: 1
Date of visit: 12/23/2013
Service: 4/5
Pricing: 4/5
Food: 5/5

OMG - where the heck have you been? Why did I not know about you sooner? Oaza means oasis in Polish and this is a Middle Eastern place.  WTF right?  Well, the owner's wife is Polish.  I think it's so adorable when owner's name their store after their loved ones, whether it be their wife, daughter, kids, husband, etc.  It adds a certain charm to it.  

Anyways, I got the chicken shawrma plate with rice, salad, hummus and pita bread for $9.99.  While this is pricier than a lot of hole-in-the-wall joints in Toronto, it is cheaper than Paramount and the quality of food is definitely here.

What I liked:
-Chicken shawrma was very fresh and nicely seasoned.  
-They use basmati rice instead of long grain rice
-Homemade hummus is to die for.  SO GOOD! They also take their pita bread and grill it for you, so it has a nice crisp to it.  A mix between a pita chip and normal baked pita, but dip it in the hummus and you start to have a foodgasm.  
-Hot sauce is very good too
-Owner is very nice

What I didn't like:
There's not much I didn't like.  While the salad was okay, it wasn't anything special.  It's not that I didn't like it, but the quality of the rice, hummus, chicken and hot sauce outshone the veggies so much.  It wasn't even a fair fight.

Verdict: Go here. It's a hidden gem in Mississauga behind a Mr. Lube (I know - weird)."}
{"text":"Great Shawarma. Fabulous sauces. Really nice man who owns the restaurant. The meat is freshly cooked and not all dried out that some Shawarma places serve. The sauces are all made in house (just ask the gentleman owner and he will talk your ear off about it). The portion sizes are good. The plate (comes with rice and meat with pickles and salad) is filling but not filling enough that you feel stuffed like a pig."}
{"text":"Consistency my fellow Yelpers. My new go to for Chicken Shawarma. The hot sauce rocks. The chicken is moist. The veg is fresh."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were in the neighbourhood after viewing yet another wedding venue and were looking for a solid food choice as we were starving.

Oaza came up in Yelp when we searched with strong reviews so we decided to take a chance.

Upon walking in, we were greeted by a very nice lady (who we later found out was the owner's sister) and felt very welcome.

The place itself was spotless - love to see that pride of ownership.

I ordered a falafel wrap and my fiance went with the mixed shawarma plate (beef/chicken). All of the food was carefully made, beautifully presented, and most importantly tasted amazing. We were told all sauces were made in house as well, which is awesome.

We also ordered one of their house made baklava to go and it was insanely delicious.

Can't wait to return!! Wish Oaza was closer to our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great family owned sharwarma restaurant! When i walked in i was greeted by the restaurant owner who was chopping fresh lettuce before taking my order. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with fries. The plate had a generous portion of chicken, and also came with a side of hummus which was great addition to the plate. 

The chicken had the standard sauces, garlic, tahini, and hot sauce. The salad was a regular garden salad but was very fresh. The fries were cavendish fries similar to the fries youd find in costco and were fried to order. It was a great meal and id repeat if im in the area."}
{"text":"As I've mentioned in my previous review of the kabab grill, I've had a past history of going to some pretty sketchy and questionable middle eastern/shawarma places before that left bad impressions in my mind.  Luckily, Oaza Shawarma Plus is an exception.

The inside of the place is pretty small which is sort of a drawback, but luckily the place looks pretty nice and is sanitary unlike many shawarma places I've been to.  The guy that was working behind the counter was really nice and even had a sense of humor, it's good to see an employee/owner who actually gives a crap about his customers for once.  He was pretty quick at preparing the food too despite the fact he was working alone.

As for the food, the chicken shawarma was great.  It tasted good and had a nice texture to it.  The rice was better than I expected and the meal also included some pita bread which was probably the most surprisingly tasty part of the meal considering i normally don't care for pita breads.  Everything was shockingly fresh, the vegetables included in the plate of food I got tasted as though they were literally just freshly cut in front of me.  The price of the meal was probably about 30% more than your typical shawarma place but it was absolutely worth it, I don't think I'd ever be willing to spend less than what I spent here again.

Overall this was a nice little hidden gem and I'd recommend it to any fans of middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Yikes, maybe we had a bad batch. We visited on a busy Thursday evening, around 7:30 PM. We were greeted by a sweet, friendly woman by the counter who answered all our questions about our orders - after craving shawarma all week, we couldn't wait to try this!

We ordered two \"plates\" (which are like combos, but without a drink) for takeout - a) the Chicken Shawarma Plate ($10.99), and b) Chicken Kabob Plate ($11.99). Each plate comes with salad, rice OR fries, and pita bread with hummus. 

The positive part is that the basmati rice and garlic sauce that accompany your meals are absolutely and positively delicious! Plus, the chicken kebabs weren't bad either - a tad tough and mildly overcooked, but marinated and seasoned very well!

Unfortunately, the rest of the food fell a bit short for us, sadly. Perhaps it had to do with having only one cook in the kitchen and many orders to fill and feed. The chicken shawarma was actually really gamey and 95% dark meat - personal preference, but I prefer chicken breast for my shawarmas. So if you like dark meat instead, this plate could be for you. I couldn't taste the chicken at all and we found it super gamey-tasting, plus we also found the hummus very bland - no real flavour here either (no kick, and it needed a dash of salt). Also, I would pass on the fries as part of your combo. The fries are re-heated frozen fries that we saw dumped out of a pre-made french fry bag you get at grocery stores (like a McCain bag) - it wasn't fresh and wasn't crispy either.

However, the rice, kebabs, and garlic sauce were so good that we may swing by one day in the future if we're ever in the area again. For two plates, we paid $25.97."}
{"text":"Solid 4/5

I was in the area and I was of course craving a shawarma... The lady working behind the counter was knowledgeable and friendly. I was asking her questions and making small talk and she proceeded to tell me that all their sauces/ingredients are made in house. Not bad! I ordered my usual chicken shawarma wrap with all the toppings and saw the baklava near the cash so I purchased that too. 

The wrap was packed with great fresh ingredients... Loved the cucumbers in my wrap...good amount of high quality meat, hummus was yummy, the garlic sauce was alright (I've had way better), but the chicken unfortunately was so salty :( I could tell my wrap would've been great if the seasonings were on point. 
The baklava was not good. It was soggy and lacked flavour. All in all I had a great customer service experience and a mediocre food experience. Will I be back for more shawarma? Probably not."}

was nothing spectacular
though it's quite tasty

i'll withhold judgment
'til i try their shawarma
for now, oaza's aight"}
{"text":"Great little touches that make this place stand out from you typical shawarma place - from the homemade hot sauce to the spices and raddish. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I decided to go here because of the great reviews on Yelp.  I ordered three shawarma and fries. 

The moment I walked in I met Robert, the owner.  He has to be the nicest owner I have ever met.  We had a long talk about his hot house.  He gave me a spoon to taste and it blew my mind.  You can tell that Robert is very passionate about his food and cooking.  We had some great conversations before I left.

The shawarma were amazing! The sauce had the extra kick I was looking for in a great sand to which.

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great shawarma.

Tell Robert that Sumanan sent you :)"}
{"text":"Walked in here after work looking for a meatless meal. Falafel sandwich and Baba Ghanouj it was! Linda served us and prepared the dishes personally. 

The baba ghanouj was fresh and delicious. It wasn't sour from using an older eggplant. Many of the chunkier fibers were still in tact, giving it a rustic texture. It's nice to have baba that isn't too heavily mayo based. We ordered a side of grilled pita (not included...) and enjoyed dipping away. 

The falafel had a nice crust and good seasoning. The vegetables were really fresh, and the pickled turnips were wonderful, not having been soaked or pickled too long (they were still white in the middle). Their hot sauce is really just like added spice without any other dimension. I slathered my extra baba on top of the sandwich. Yum. 

The baklava was nothing to rave about, but it wasn't oversoaked in honey. I would have appreciated more of the nutty filling and some more seasoning. Still a nice sweet bite.

Worth giving a try for their shawarma next!"}
{"text":"Good Shawarma place tucked away to a small plaza off Dundas Street. First time there and tried out all his home made sauce. Not disappointed at all, but next time might not choose the hot sauce, a little too hot for me. Will be back"}
{"text":"For a tasty Shawarma this is the place to go. All the ingredients are prepared fresh and the service from \"Robert\" is second to none. So nice to stop into a place where the person serving you is HAPPY... I can't stress that enough. Stop in you won't be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty dinner after my daughters softball game.  The owner was very friendly and provided a recommendation of the platter which included chicken rice salad and pita. Freshly made in house. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not sure I get all the raves about this place? I tried the shwarma when it first opened and was not overly impressed. I gave it another shot a few days ago because of the new five star reviews and found it identical? Just not my style I guess."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good falafel sandwich for some time. I don't eat out very often but when I do, I prefer not to have microwaved or \"under a heat lamp\" food. Oaza's falafel was deep fried fresh while I waited. The additional vegetables were fresh and delicious and the finishing touch of the sandwich being place in the press was enough to crisp the pita but not enough to wilt the lettuce. Perfect! The end result was the best falafel that I have had in years. Yum!
The owner was very nice and friendly. I left thinking that this just might be my \"go to\" place when I get a hankering for a falafel, and once I tasted it, with the pickled vegetables and wonderful home made sauces, no doubt was left in my mind."}
