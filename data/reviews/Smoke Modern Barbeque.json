{"text":"A group of us were attending a conference in the Lake Norman area and were looking for a place to eat that was opened after 9pm and could accommodate a party of 25.  I was very pleased that Smoke Modern BBQ quickly seated us, service was excellent, and the food was good.  My husband and I order the 4 meat combo platter which included ribs, brisket, pulled chicken and pulled pork.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  As an appetizer, we order smoked wings and devilish eggs.  I like \"smokey\" flavored foods so the wings were as I expected and good.  If you don't like smoked foods, then do not order the wings as they were extra smokey.  If you like spicy sauces, they have a Carolina and a Texas BBQ sauce that were very tasty.  Our sides included mac and cheese, beans and cole slaw.  All of those items were good.  To finish the night, we had the brownie dessert and it was very moist and good.  The portions are very large as we took home much of the food.  The sweet tea was not too sweet which is the way that I like it.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was great with our friends.  We had James as our waitor and he was wonderful and very attentive.  He know the food and make great recommendation.  We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"It is an attractive place inside.  The insertion of \"Modern\" in the name tells the BBQ traditionalists not to judge the place as a traditional Carolina BBQ joint.  Although the vibe is more upscale, I would compare the menu to Mac's Speed Shop.  The food is good, although to my taste, both the vibe and the food at Mac's are a little better.  Still, if the location and appearance of the place get more people eating Q, then I am all for it!"}
{"text":"From the service to the food, everything was five stars. We had a table of six and the food was quick and got to the us promptly. We started with corn bread and it had a delicious spread with it. Everyone was very pleased with the dinners. The pulled pork melted in your mouth, the mac and cheese was spot on, the ribs, chicken, brisket... Everything was 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with the family. We shared appetizers, ribs, and sides so we could taste a variety of menu items. The food was delicious.  Good sized portions as well as beer and wine selections. Friendly staff and we had an excellent waitress. Sat on the patio. If you like barbecue, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Entertained some clients for lunch yesterday.  Very nice place with very good service.  The \"Q\" was awesome.  The portions are HUGE!  I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but service was uneven. First time we were here, I would have given it a 5 based on food quality plus service. Tonight the food was good, but service was disappointing. Had to ask for drink refills, boxes, and did not get a standard wet towel after ordering ribs. Big bummer."}
{"text":"Even if you don't enjoy barbecue, if you love macaroni and cheese this place is a must to try out! The best and creamiest macaroni and cheese I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time! This was our first visit and we will surely return soon.  We started our meal with the onion ring appetizer. I prefer onion rings to be sliced thinly, but these were pretty thick. The taste, however, was excellent and they were cooked perfectly. My only suggestion would be to serve the smoked garlic ranch dip in a larger container as we ran out of it way too soon.  We ordered the pulled pork, pulled chicken, and beef brisket and all three were delicious! The brisket was my favorite, very tender, full of flavor, and not a bit of fat. The pulled pork was amazing also. The chicken was my least favorite, but was still quite good. We both ordered the \"smokin' slaw\" with our meals and, while it was a bit different from the slaw offered at most BBQ restaurants, it was very good. My wife's loaded baked potato was huge and cooked perfectly. As one of my sides, I ordered the Mac-n-cheese and our server recommended upgrading it to the \"Burnt End Mac\", ($2.95 upcharge) which I did. This was a most excellent decision on my part! The dish was amazing! Comfort food on steroids, I must say. It was a generous portion of mac-n-cheese with chunks of brisket, tomatoes, and scallions, tossed in a little bit of sweet bbq sauce. It's offered as one of their entrees and I may just order that as my meal next time I visit. It's that good!"}
{"text":"It is a very well designed place to eat, and is, obviously very modern with all of the LEDs. The food tastes very delicious and is served with a lot of thought out in the look of it too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Smoke last night and enjoyed the Charlotte Restaurant Week menu. This was our first visit and I was excited to see (and taste!) what all the buzz was about.   For starters I had the burnt ends mac and cheese and my husband had the burnt ends appetizer. His burnt ends were done Korean-style and were out of this world. My husband had the ribs entree with sides of baked beans and mac and cheese. Despite others complaining about the baked beans, we found them to be quite tasty. I had the 2-meat platter consisting of pulled pork and smoked chicken. Both meats were perfectly done! My sides included creamed spinach and cole slaw. I would definitely get the creamed spinach again! We both had so much food left over we were able to off our leftovers for dinner tonight. I had the brownie sundae while my husband had the banana pudding.   Our server, Kate was fantastic! The manager stopped by our table to see if we enjoyed our first experience. We assured him we would be back again soon. Already planning our next outing to Smoke!"}
{"text":"Review below was posted out sheer annoyance. Have to say that I got a very positive and detailed message from the GM of the store. We have to remember that all businesses can have off days. How one handles them is a measure of good management. Impressed with his positive response. Certainly made things right on his store's behalf. Thank you.   Ordered a to go order. Very simple one. They Said 15-20 mins. Arrived 20 mins later to give them time. It is now an hour later and still waiting for my order. This is pathetic. People have been seated at the same time as l arrived and have finished eating already."}
{"text":"I spent a lot of $ here and felt the service wasn't worthy.  The food was properly portioned and was okay but not worth the $. I may give it one more try on takeout and will get something other than the brisket.  Somewhat disappointed after reading the reviews."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place because it's new, located in the Birkdale village, and it doesn't look like a run-down shed in someone's back yard.  Sadly, those were practically the good things about Smoke.  The BBQ was dry and unremarkable.  Like another review said, for a place called Smoke, it's noticeably missing from the meat.  The Mac & cheese was underwhelming and tasted more of cream than cheese, if that makes sense.  Also, we noticed a serious lack of green from the sides.  No green beans, no collards, just creamed spinach.  The only bright spots came from the Philly sandwich and the bread that came with the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches.  The Philly was very flavorful and juicy and the horseradish was perfect on it.  The buns were toasted onion rolls and held up to the respected meats that we ordered.  Overall, the atmosphere and the servers were all big points for me, but the actual featured food needs some assistance.  Queen City Q and Saucemans still will be our go-to places until that happens."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Smoke Modern BBQ.  First off, the atmosphere is wonderful - the restaurant looks simply amazing.  It is sleek and modern but has a warmth to it that doesn't at all make it feel sterile or formal.  Second, the food is excellent.  The wings (in the Korean BBQ sauce) are fantastic - big, juicy, and the flavor is wonderful.  I found both the brisket and the ribs to be as good as any that I have found in the area, if not better.  And the Mac and Cheese?  Sinful.  I am happy to be adding this to my restaurant rotation and think that this will be a great addition to the Birkdale community."}
{"text":"This place is like your old fashioned bbq,just really modern!!! Usually I get the half rack of ribs with a side of Mac-n-cheese and fries.They taste AMAZING.It is sort of hidden we had to drive around the place like 5 times before I spotted it.It is the area with Kirklands.Other than the sort of hidden part I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ pulled pork sandwiches with slaw! Mmm! This is such a fun place to go for consistently good BBQ. I would recommend starting with the onion rings. They are piled high and our family loves them. The pulled pork sandwich is my favorite, so I always order this. The ingredients are fresh and the BBQ is perfectly smoked. You can even order the gourmet Mac n cheese as your side for an extra indulgence! It's delicious. This is a wonderful restaurant that will leave you happy and full of great BBQ! Additionally, the staff are always outstanding, which makes the experience awesome!"}
{"text":"So. First off we walk into the establishment and run into a hostess who doesn't know her job. I asked her was tabletop seating first-come first serve. She looked at me as if I spoke Mandarin or I was from the moon. Thank God that this place recognizes that their staff maybe incompetent and put a sign up that says \"table tabletops are first come first serve.\" or maybe I just don't pay attention. Anyway got to the table and the server has been great so far. I ordered the half chicken garlic mashed potatoes and baked beans. My boyfriend ordered a sausage, mac & cheese and sweet potato fries. Let's discuss my meal. The mash potatoes had no garlic whatsoever no salt or any flavor for that matter. The chicken was really juicy but it was bland as well. The baked beans were just not good. On the other hand my boyfriends meal was great. The mac & cheese is really good, the sausage was amazing. The sweet potato fries are your every restaurant standard sweet potato fries dusted with salt and pepper. All in all I probably won't return to this so-called modern barbecue spot. There are some better hole in the wall places in Charlotte. Prices are fair n the atmosphere is pretty good. The mac & cheese is a go though!"}
{"text":"They have the best barbecue in ALL of NC (we are originally from St. Louis, MO, so we know good barbecue).  On our first visit to Smoke, the manager came to our table, before we ordered and offered to bring us a sample of their corn bread muffins (that was a good idea on his part, because now we continue to order them each time we come). Their barbecue sauces are soooo good and complement their delicious meats so well. I would definitely recommend their pulled pork, burnt end Mac&Cheese or their ribs. My family and I have been back to Smoke recently and continue to have great service, food, as well as enjoy the delightful atmosphere.  This is a great place for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. AJ did an awesome job servicing church our family on yesterday. The staff and hostess were friendly and accommodated our large party of 14 in the bar area! The corn muffins are now my favorite!!! Great BBQ... We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went a couple days ago with some friends thinking it would be above average being in Birkdale, but our expectations where far from met for the price.  I had a philly sandwich which was pretty good but the fries where bland, cold and not that good.  The steak my husband got was tough and flavorless, although the redskin mash potatoes where good.  Someone messed up and brought our friend's side over and said the food was coming right behind and she got nothing for 20 minutes, so it ended up being more an appetizer.  They did replace and give her more tatertots with her actual meal.  The tater tots where nothing special, they tasted like the frozen ones I buy at the grocery store.  The seemed to be a little overwhelmed, it took them a good 10 minutes to get us our drinks and then finally a while later came the food.  The brisket was kind of tough and lacking flavor.  The two plates that we got came to over $40 and in my opinion was not worth it at all.  The staff was courteous and kind and apologetic for the mistakes that where made at least."}
{"text":"Recently visited for the first time with a group of six.  We all enjoyed our food, the brisket was excellent.  Banana pudding is awesome, as long as it's vanilla wafers and not the lemon (:  Go with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Sat at the empty bar on a Saturday night... the food was horrible, the service was horrible... this place will not be around for long"}
{"text":"everything was delicious! Especially the burnt ends on the Korean bbq sauce! We will for sure be going back to try more!"}
{"text":"I ran a bachelor party dinner for a good friend of mine, one recent Saturday.  25 guys.  They set us up at an outside table and treated us like GOD;s.  The food is great, but the service is SECOND TO NONE.  You have to give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed.  Prices are incredibly fair.  TRY THE MAC AND CHEESE.  WOW."}
{"text":"For this edition of Excited about Eating we visited Smoke Modern Barbeque located in Huntersville's Birkdale Village.  This ultra-modern restaurant is not your normal BBQ joint. With the contemporary, industrial style decor, you would expect a much higher priced menu.   Now I like to consider myself somewhat of a BBQ connoisseur, with my BBQ hobby of judging KCBS events. So when I visit a BBQ restaurant, I expect tournament quality meat, cooked to perfection with the right amount of smoke. I was not disappointed at this restaurant.   I planned to share with our grandson, so I could sample a variety of meats. I chose the Smokin' Q Combo with pork spareribs, beef brisket, and smoked sausage with sides of mac n cheese and my favorite, tater tots. The ribs were perfect, not fall-off-the-bone overcooked, like so many BBQ restaurants, but with the right amount of pull and full of juice. The brisket was lean and tender, smoky, and definitely not dry. The sausage was a little spicy and full of favor.    Dora here. A little spicy? Yowzers! That sausage was pop-your-eyeball spicy! Phew! One bite and our grandkiddo nibbled on the brisket and ribs instead. lol.   Wow! So many items to choose from on their menu, it was difficult to pick just one. The Summer Strawberry Salad was just the right choice for lunch. With two of my favorite fruits, strawberries and pear sticks, how could I go wrong? Piled high with grilled chicken (shrimp was also an option), almonds and melt-on-your-tongue goat cheese and coated with balsamic vinaigrette, this salad was light and fresh. Delish!    Can you believe that even with three of us eating only two meals, we still brought home two boxes of leftovers?  No debates over this, folks. 5 forks all the way! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, For more mouth-watering reviews, please stop by our Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog. http://dorahiers.blogspot.com/2015/09/excited-about-eating-by-ernie-hiers.html"}
{"text":"So far so good starters Ice cold beer with the charbroiled oysters and burnt ends. Awesome  Ribs and brisket on the way..."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at 8pm and it was still busy so we decided to sit bar. There were two bartenders working that gave us no acknowledgment. After a few minutes I finally asked for two menus. He gave them to us without any form of eye contact. Then he asked what we wanted to drink and if we are ready to order. At this point I felt like I was bothering him and rushed. I got chicken and sweet potato fries. It came with two sides, but I wanted a side salad as one. It was $4.95 extra for the side salad. I found that was very expensive! The chicken was good, but the service at the bar was not very customer friendly nor hospitable."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is amazing the waitstaff is amazing and knowledgeable. The Korean wings are tasty the Mac and cheese to die for"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket! Food is great, and well priced! 18.95 for 3 choices of meats, and 2 sides! Bring back the mint bread pudding!"}
{"text":"Did you know that February 22nd is National Margarita day? I sure didn't! But Smoke sent an e-mail advertising $5 Margaritas and a special Brisket Queso for $5.95. You can't beat that deal! So, after work, we went over to Smoke.   To our surprise, not only were Margaritas $5, but Martinis were as well. SCORE!   We decided to sit at the bar. This was not due to a wait for a table, but instead because we liked the look of the bar itself. The stools had full backs and I always enjoy the near immediate service from a bartender rather than waiting for a server to make their way to our table. I wish we had taken a table...  We sat at the bar for nearly 10 minutes before the bartender came to take our drink order. We both ordered Gin Martinis which, while tasty, did not fill the glass (those must be the $5 versions). It was another 10 minutes before she came to take our food order. At this point, she apologized profusely for our wait. I had noticed that she was also taking care of the 2 tables behind us and mentioned how impressive that was. She then admitted that she was the only bartender and that it was normal for her to have those tables but, with 2 drink specials, she was busier than normal.   That was an understatement! She was swamped! The more we watched her, the more it was apparent that management should have scheduled a second person to tend bar. I could understand a beer special with Margaritas, but the bartender was making complicated cocktails back to back to back. That is a clear case of Corporate greed. Instead of trading one special for another, you have 2 specials which brings in more patrons, but you are too cheap to pay another person to be behind the bar. I just hope the bartender received good tips that night. She is the reason I gave the 2nd star.  As for the food: it was really good! 4 stars easily. But, I cannot give 4 stars to a restaurant that would rather save money and overwork their people than make certain they are properly staffed."}
{"text":"The food at this place is fantastic. Went in for the first time the other night, had pulled pork, it was cooked to perfection and offered with a large selection of different BBQ sauces to try all of which were excellent. Sides were great, service was excellent (the place was busy, service was still great) beer was cold and the food is perfect. Can't ask for much more than that, if you're in the birkdale village area, definitely try smoke modern BBQ."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! The food is delicious and the staff is very polite and make your visit so fun! The area is very nice with the outdoor seating area. Usually has a band and a fire to sit by. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't tried it and wants some good BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"We used Smoke Modern for our wedding catering in May and they were nothing short of AMAZING!! First off, the food is out of this world and all of our guests reiterated that fact to us afterwards. Second, the service is top-notch and they really cared about making our wedding day the best day possible. When our wedding planner stopped doing her job, SM even took over her duties. The GM, head chef, and event coordinator were all there on our wedding day. They were professional, efficient, and downright wonderful to work with. I told my husband at one point I wish all our wedding vendors were as great as our caterers. We HIGHLY recommend Smoke Modern to anyone wanting BBQ catering for their wedding!"}
{"text":"All you need to know is bacon wrapped shrimp! Bbq pork is ok but there sandwhiches are great!"}
{"text":"3rd time here, and the last 2 have been pretty stellar!!! We opted for the restraint week menu which was a entree, a starter a desert, and a craft beer or glass of wine for $30. Wife got the salmon which was cooked perfectly and lots of smokey good flavor. I opted for my usual burnt ends with Korean BBQ sauce, with creamed spinach and burnt ends Mac! Everything was perfect!  Our server James was fantastic! Kind and very knowledgeable about the menu items, and was on the spot with drink refills, and everything was hot and DELISH! Highly recc Smoke to anyone in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning! The door greeting was strange. We ordered off the lunch menu before they recognized the time. My order came out incorrect, even after I explained how I do not want it & the waiter checked to make sure, that I can have it my way. The replacement (no charge), was just has undercooked as the original. The initial dish wasn't prepped according to the menu. And... my tasteless mashed potatoes had a full clove of garlic placed in the center, which I didn't see, until I began to chew it. The waiter was very attentive & apologetic, despite my dining experience. And he was tipped appropriately, for none of it was his fault. To top it off... Not one of the managers came to try to rectify the problem! Only my dinner. The other three were a ok!"}
{"text":"The food is a bit pricey, but amazing. Melt in your mouth brisket. Cheese grits, collards, smoked sausage and prime rib...all incredible. Burnt ends good but need more crisp. Craft cocktails delicious but need more alcohol. All in all a must visit."}
{"text":"Well, we took another chance on takeout after two prior bad experiences. We received an email about a special sandwich and side they were running for a few days. It looked really good and against our better judgement, we called the order in and asked for 2 orders with the same sides. So down we go again to pick it up. The young lady working the front counter was the one who took the phone order. She took my wife's credit card, rings it up and hands her the receipt to sign. My wife looks at it and there is only one sandwich on it, so lo and behold, here we go again! This time there was a whole meal missing even after repeating the order back to my wife on the phone. My wife lets her know and again we get the usual \"I'm so sorry\" and she proceeds to go back to the kitchen to have them make the second meal. After my wife waits another 20 minutes while they were making the second meal, the first sandwich and fries were getting cold in the bag. I don't even have to say \"three strikes and you're out\". We will NEVER order takeout again. There are too many other places that can take an order and get it right. We should have known better."}
{"text":"Was driving through NC and wanted some BBQ. Had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac and cheese. Wonderful. Would eat here again if I'm through town."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but the portions leave a lot to be desired when you consider how much you're paying. Also, don't make this your first stop on a romantic evening -- you're going to leave smelling like barbecue smoke. And not a little bit like smoke, but a LOT like smoke."}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor is nice. You can see the smoker in the kitchen. All I really have to say is this place is amazing! We started off with two appetizers...the bacon wrapped shrimp, which how could you go wrong with shrimp wrapped in bacon and the deviled eggs (a flavor explosion in my mouth) so the experience started off great. I had the beef brisket and pork ribs, although it was lunch time the portion size was huge. Needless to say I had plenty left over. They allow you to pick the fat ratio of your brisket which is really good. You can taste the smoke flavor throughout your meat. The side I picked with my meal was creamed spinach, the flavor was great just needed salt (that's what the salt shaker is for, lol) but no points taken because of that. Because I'm greedy I also got the Mac and cheese which wasn't all that impressive but I'm sure the upgraded varieties are a better buy. My date opted for the smokin burger which he raved about and was also unable to finish. Soooo, to sum it up this place is a great place to go to enjoy great barbecue without going to a hole in the wall, lol. Great environment, service and huge portions. Annnnnnd the KC royal sauce!!! Sheeeesh!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and it keeps getting better. Their Brisket is incredible. And I love that they ask if you want a lean or fatty cut. Some people like one or the other so it's great they deliver on that. The specialty mac and cheeses are amazing and you can upgrade to one of those for a small up charge. Prices are a little higher than other BBQ restaurants but they also give you more food than those other places do so the value for the money is excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch today.....  3 people at host stand serving one take out client.....  after informed the people in front of us it would be a 20 minute wait... there were many, many open and  free tables so we  just left...   May try again but doubtful.."}
{"text":"Moderately priced, great brisket and a spot on wait staff makes for a winning combination. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. It's three steps up from Max's down the road. Great Upscale barbecue, presentation is excellent, food is fantastic and the prices are not bad at all considering the classy atmosphere. I highly recommend it. Great date night dinner place."}
{"text":"Service wonderful. Food lacking. Atmosphere great!  Disappointed in the BBQ experience. Brisket was so fatty a gristley. French fries were basic, not fresh cut or anything. Green beans in pecan butter was the vegetable of the day and they were so undercooked I could barely cut them. Prob could've snapped them, but couldn't cut them to eat!  The server and manager were very attentive and friendly but that's about all it has going for it. The fire pit outside was nice.  I'd stop here for drinks only. Skip the over priced food menu."}
{"text":"Caveat: I'm not a real BBQ fan so take this as you will!  Meh. Meh. Meh.  I had the baby back ribs. They were a bit tough and over smoked. Couldn't taste the meat. I ended up drowning it in sauce to offset the bitterness.  The slaw on the other hand......I wish I just ordered a double helping of that!  They were out of key lime pie so went with the cheesecake. Tasted like it was a Sara Lee boxes cheesecake. Ended up tossing it out.  Wine list was fine....good mix of styles.  Service? Not great. We were a party of 8 women (good tippers all) and we were pretty much ignored with refills of anything that wasn't alcohol. One order was messed up (not sure how \"chicken\" can be misheard as \"pork\" but...) and several of the checks were wrong.   I am not in any rush to go back."}
{"text":"FOOD was WONDERFUL & our waiter was the best - ask for T.J (aka Baldwin twin) he will make your meal wonderful!! I've become a repeat customer & my clients love the food & service! FIVE STARS!  Stacey"}
{"text":"I needed a bite to eat while in Birkdale and Smoke fit the bill.  We sat at the bar and were just looking for a drink and an appetizer.  They had lots of local beers to pick from which was good, so I settled for a beer for Legion while the boyfriend got a beer from Birdsong.    We took a look at the menu and chose the brisket mac & cheese (after thoroughly perusing all the yelp photos, of course).  It was delicious and just the right amount of food that we were looking for."}
{"text":"Decent meal at good prices for the neighborhood and clientele.  Service was spot-on and my waiter attended to my needs proficiently.  Thanks, Joey!  Ordered a smoked bbq salad.  It was good, but not a big fan of sweet bbq sauce.  The ranch dressing didn't hold my attention, either.  Lots on the menu to try so I'll need to make another trip."}
{"text":"So many amazing barbecue sauces to go with their mainly Kansas city style barbecue. I had the half chicken with cole slaw and \"smashed potatoes.\" It was way too much for me to eat, but I was happy with everything. The only thing I would change is the location. I'm not a fan of eating in a shopping center. I'm from out of town and found this place online. I wish someone would have told us it was in a shopping center. I enjoy a more traditional feel with my BBQ. But overall, this was pretty amazing as far as taste and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this eatery for the first time and were delighted. We got some cocktails which were really good and I must say that our waiter was very personable and knowledgeable on everything listed on the menu. We had the Smokin' Q Combo with 4 meats and 2 sides. Our meats were all delish-YUM! and the sides we got were the Smokin Slaw and the Shrimp Macoroni/Cheese.   In terms of cost, this was probably of the more affordable meals we've had and that included the drinks.   There were also really tempting desserts but we passed so can't speak on that.  Atmosphere: Casual and sports bar-like. There is outside dining area which is probably enjoyable when weather permits.  We traveled to have dinner here before going to the movies. This restaurant has ample parking and of course being in the Hunterville shopping area allows for great browsing.  I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great newer restaurant in Birkdale.  I am a grits fan, and these are the best grits I have ever had. The barbecue is very good too. Great decor inside and fun patio seating."}
{"text":"We were seated in the last 30 min of kitchen hours, so maybe that explains why my pulled chicken barbecue was a bit dry. Also my brisket was extremely fatty, which I pointed out to the waitress. She stated \" oh, I should've offered you Lean or fatty\" and she reciprocated by bringing some more edible, lean pieces. Who eats pure fat? Yes, the coleslaw was delicious. Yes, there was smoke taste in the meats. But at $20 a plate you could get as good if not better barbecue at Lancaster's for half the price. What the heck!  This is Carolina, home to great barbecue. (No slight to Texas.)"}
{"text":"Have to say  this ppl are Tryiing to hard to be a BBQ place. Really place looks ok a little wannabe  horrible service. Drinks. Where good  about. Food when I have  nothing good to say about something prefer. No to say anything  I pretty sure won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"One f the best be places around.  A little higher than some, but worth every penny!  Try the prime rib...best around"}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue. Burnt ends was my favorite that I got on the three meat plate. Mac and cheese is a must"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and a pleasant setting for date night with the Mrs. I'd recommend the four meat combo for two. Just enough to share and walk away without waddling. As in other reviews, the pulled pork is outstanding. Next time, we are doubling up the pulled pork, getting the jalapeño sausage, and trying something new. Potentially doubling up on the tater tots as the two sides as well. Awesome"}
{"text":"First time here!  Food was amazing and best service I have received in years! Our server James was very knowledgeable and recommended a few items. Great personality and made us feel right at home. The food was delicious and the drinks superb! From starters, to main course and even side dishes. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great Decor and Service but Cusine needs works.  Maybe it's because I like Barbecue that I am so picky. This place has an outstanding decor and the service is excellent.    Problem is the cusine does not deliver.  Ordered the Pulled Pork plate with the House Baked Beans as a side. Pork was overcooked and was served on a plate that trapped the rendered fat to the point that the meat was swimming it.  The pork was tough and stringy.  Baked Beans were undercooked and way to sweet for my taste and the Hickory Smoke Flavoring added to the beans was overwhelming.  Has a bit of a ways to go. Will give them another shot at a later date."}
{"text":"Awesome! Some of the best brisket and pulled pork I've had. You can cut the brisket with a fork. My wife really enjoyed their coleslaw as well. The service was attentive and cheerful. Alesha, our server, was perfect."}
{"text":"I'm leaving a short review as an addendum to my first review. I'm still giving it 5 stars! If ever you get a chance to order the roast prime rib, order it! It is only served on Friday & Saturday but it's wonderful. I've never eaten prime rib tat had a smoke flavor infused but I'm very impressed! Great job Smoke on a delicious stak"}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant and we will be back. The restaurant is very nice almost contemporarily formal inside with a great outdoor porch. The menu is diverse with beef, fish, and chicken dishes as well as salads and sandwiches.  The service was amazingly fast. The reason that it only warrants 3 stars is that for the high end prices, the portions are on the modest side and all of our dishes were cooked just a little off. The deviled eggs were salty, the chicken was dry, the beef was tough, the mac and cheese was rubbery. Not inedible, just not great. We will return, this was a fun place, but I wanted to provide you with both sides of the meal. Fun place, just ok food."}
{"text":"Ugh!!!! So this used to be my little hidden gem in Birkdale Village but I don't know what happened but the food quality has gone waaaaaay down. I'm not so sure as to say you could call it \"modern barbecue\" but you can get non-traditional items such as nachos with a protein of your choice (smoked chicken, pulled pork, or brisket) or MAC n cheese loaded with the same. It's decently priced for the portion sizes but not nearly as flavorful as I remember.   We've been customers since they put the nachos on the menu and order them each time we dine in. With the exception of one time, the nachos have been perfectly seasoned and prepared. And even that one time they weren't because they were cold, it was immediately addressed and replaced.   We had a 45-minute wait this time (never!) but hey we were looking forward to nachos. Longer story shorter, we had a great server but not great food. The nachos were cold twice and the flavor was just lacking in everything we ate. So much so that I'm not really interested in returning. #thethrillisgone"}
{"text":"Awesome!  I try not to review until I have gone to a place a couple of times (everyone can have an off day). Service has been wonderful!  Danny delivered outstanding service! Food presentation and taste was delightful.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about my dining experience at Smoke!  First, the service was incredible.  Our waiter was friendly and funny and able to make great recommendations about food and drinks.  I was very impressed by the rest of the waitstaff as well.  They were very busy but any time we finished a plate or a drink someone walking by would gather our used dishes from the table, which I really appreciated. The food was excellent!  Some of the highlights were the Mac & Cheese, smashed potatoes, and smoked sausage.  My boyfriend had shrimp and grits and the grits were cooked perfectly.  For dessert I had the banana pudding which was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Really good - and a bit different BBQ for NC! A group of 4 of us went on a Saturday night and had a reservation - which I'd recommend - and got in very close to our appointed time. The atmosphere is casual, with quite a few families there with kids, but also couples and singles hanging out.  We got a drink at the bar as we got there quite a bit before our reservation time and had drinks. The bartender was very busy but got our drinks quickly and efficiently. Drinks are priced a bit on the high side, but were all very tasty and well prepared.  We got a variety of dishes for dinner and all of them were very good. Serving sizes are reasonable, so you can finish what you get - depending on what you get of course. Prices are very fair for the serving sizes and you have a great assortment of sides to pick from. The smokin' slaw was very good (not all that spicy), the baked beans had a good smoky flavor, the cheesy grits were good, and the loaded baked potato comes at no extra charge, but isn't as 'loaded' as you might get at an establishment that charges for it.  BBQ is a variety of styles - with some sauced and some not. There are 4 different sauces on the table to choose from as well to doctor up your meal a bit more.  Very good - something for everyone, including children, and you can leave as full as you want to!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! My husband, friend and I all absolutely loved what we ordered. Rave reviews for the shrimp and grits, barbecued pulled pork and barbecue chicken salad. The brownie sundae was also a delicious dessert to share! Our waitress was very friendly and service was attentive and quick -- especially impressive since they've only been open for such a short time!"}
{"text":"Smoke was great when it first opened but each successive meal I've eaten here has been worse than the previous meal. We have probably been here 10 times or more but no more! Ribs have tasted of charcoal briquettes the last 2 times we ordered them and in general, the food has gone from \"good\" to \"meh\" over the last 2 years, so much so that I doubt I will return except under duress.   If you want BBQ, go to Midwood Smokehouse. Their food is consistently great and not as oily. Sorry, Smoke, I have to go for quality over proximity!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale bbq place. You will find families, couples, nice music, etc.  however, for really good bbq in 'man size' portions, you need to go somewhere else. The Cole slaw is great as is the Mac n cheese. Creamed spinach ,,, more like spinach and garlic and no cream. My sons pork plate was good.  Not a lot though.  I had smoked chicken so dry it was like cardboard. My 4 little ribs were tasty and not the most tender I've had. Hubbys beef was decent. Waiter was awesome. He was very attentive."}
{"text":"Doesn't make a differance how good the food is if the service is awful. Its the second time I tried it, not going back. Service, service, service."}
{"text":"Friday night and the place was jumpin! Smoke takes BBQ to a new level. Even though we had to wait for quite awhile for a table of 6 we were not disappointed. The atmosphere and decor were great and the food was absolute amazing. Between us we tried bacon wrapped shrimp and fried okra appetizers that flew off the plate. The corn bread barely hit the table before they were gone. The brisket, ribs and herb smoked chicken were perfection . The sides perfectly complemented the meat. Everybody left full and happy. The wait staff were very courteous and helpful. We'll be back for sure and maybe next time we'll spend a little happy hit time out by the fire pit. Make smoke a stop on your dinner plans soon."}
{"text":"We visited here again tonight and sat on the patio. As it turns out, there is no lighting on the patio and it was incredibly dark. Our server, Tyler, waited on tables that were seated after us. He finally greeted us with, \"Sorry for the delay\".   We ordered the onion straws - which were horrible. They had a fake onion flavor and zero onion texture. We also ordered the brisket and ribs. After we received our appetizer, he came to tell us that they were out of ribs - the tables that placed their orders BEFORE ours got their ribs. I will NOT bother to go there again.   Recommendation: eater beware, apparently the service and the food are hit or miss."}
{"text":"My Wife and I went for an early dinner after seeing the menu on Charlotte Restaurant Week. I had the full slab of ribs with Mac and Cheese and Beans. The ribs were great, with the meat falling off the bones. Caesar Salad was one the best I have ever had, which was my appetizer. My wife wanted the Rib eye Steak with baked Potato but it wasn't 4:00 yet, so the Baked Potato or Mashed Potato's weren't  available yet ( it was only 3:30.) Our server, James, went over and above though and had them make a Baked Potato for her. She said her steak was flavorful and tender and she brought half home, as it was so large. She also had the Mixed Slaw, which she said was great. Our first trip there, but we will be back with our family and be sure to get James as our server again! They also take reservations, which is great for large parties. James recommended the Prime Rib, which is only on Friday and Saturday, and we will be back to try it."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place.  I always sit at the bar because I'm not a huge fan of the atmosphere (their lights at the front give off a cool white light that seem too bright for my taste).  The food is great.  The drinks are awesome.  I highly recommend the creamed spinach.  Get a plate of burnt ends (not Korean style, too sweet for my taste).  Cool concept - BBQ I can get anywhere for a much smaller check - but awesome still.  I've been twice and will most likely go back."}
{"text":"We went here for beef bbq (in the south \"bbq\" means pork).  So we were anxious to try some good beef brisket.  We have tasted fantastic brisket in Kansas City MO.  Smoke Modern BBQ is not the same.  I was hoping they would bring the brisket cooked to perfection without the sauce already on it.  That way, I could add the sauce I wanted and even sample several different sauces.  Not the case at Smoke.  Our brisket came already drowned in bbq sauce.   Smoke only had 3 different sauces at the table (in KC we had six).  The garlic smashed potatoes were ordinary.  The cheesecake for dessert was disappointing at $6 per small slice.  They did offer $3 bottle beer that night.  That was a good deal.   Overall, I would look elsewhere for beef barbeque."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Excellent staff and service the second you walk in the door. Very clean, open and of course...... Modern. Three meat plate was excellent. Although, the Spare Ribs were cooked perfect they didn't have a lot of flavor before sauce was added. The Moist/Wet Brisket was great, but maybe too much fat left on. Mac N Cheese and Collard Greens were perfect! Definitely will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"The food could've been awesome. But, we sat for 10 minutes without being acknowledged by anyone. Seeing as I'm 8 months pregnant and hungry, I didn't have the patience to wait any longer. Too bad, too. The restaurant was pretty dead, even for a Tuesday- even though other Birkdale establishments, like Bonefish & Dresslers have a 20+ minute wait. If service continues like this, the restaurant will not last long."}
{"text":"Hostesses are not very inviting. Servers are friendly. Food is very good! Clean dining area and family friendly."}
{"text":"Heads up! Your clothes will go straight to the laundry after you dine here and women may need to wash their hair! You will get smokey!  Food is fantastic! Service is great and decor/ambience are also great! The restaurant has an outdoor eating area which is nice to enjoy the weather and some cold beer!  We have ordered the combos so we could get a taste of several dishes. A combo of 3 meats can be shared but I wouldn't share it, as it was SO GOOD that it was worth to ingest the extra calories!  The ribs had meat and quite generous! For this price you will not find any place in Charlotte and probably very few others in the country that can serve such meaty ribs!   The nachos are a must have. I am very picky about nachos but these were fantasic. The burnt ends are also amazing and a must have!  Restaurant has their own wine but I have not tried. Next time! The wine list did not feature any of my known wines but had some variety including a German wine, which is quite interesting."}
{"text":"A gem in Birkdale.  We did a combo plate at our last visit. Was superfood. Favorite was the smoked sausage with the mustard bbq sauce. Pulled pork was spot on. For sides the creamed spinach is great - topped with crunchy spicy topping.   Server was good and ambiance is good too. This was our third time in and have not been disappointed yet.  I'd call it a classed up Mac's with better bbq."}
{"text":"Holy yum!  I had a lunch meeting with a client in Huntersville and he suggested this place and said that he frequents it and now I see why.  We thought for a minute about the salads but when I travel for work I like to have things I don't typically have at home and BBQ is one of those things.  We both ordered the same thing -- pulled pork plate and Mac and cheese.      The lunch portion is generous as in I ate about half before giving up and realizing I couldn't spend the rest of my day in a food coma.  The pork is slow cooked and season perfectly with a nice char on several pieces.  I tried and liked all of the sauces as well which they leave on the table for customers.  The mac and cheese was incredible, very flavorful.  I think next time I would order it with the BBQ meat in it - so so good.  I will definitely be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Hour wait on Sat night. Combo for two was good. Yummy bbq sauces. Mac n cheese was good but not special. Overpriced menu. Smoked chicken was the best- moist. Very busy & loud atmosphere. Great & friendly service. I'd come back but have had better bbq."}
{"text":"I would like to update my review with Smoke.   After a few months I decided to give it another shot. Our waiter was very attentive, food was much better and I really didn't have a single thing to complain about.   I even went back again and had the same experience. Glad they stepped up their game!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I have now been here 3 times. I'm decreasing the stars because the quality of the food for each of my visits has been inconsistent. The first time I went I ordered the mac and cheese with burnt ends and it was delicious. The second time I went, I ordered the same and it was not good. The second time it had too many chopped tomatoes, onions or whatever they put in there and barely any burnt ends. It was runny and not cheesy at all. I didn't even finish it. We just went again this past weekend and I ordered the 2 meat combo plate. I always order either the 2 or 3 meat combo. And, I always order the beef brisket. First time I received 4 strips of brisket, the second time I received 4, but this last time I only received 2 strips. Also, this last time I ordered just the plain Mac n cheese- no burnt ends. It was funny and flavorless. I'd seen pics by other guests of their Mac and cheese which appeared to be cooked better - meaning the mac and cheese had that top that was almost brown - like it is when you make at home. I will say that the grits were very good."}
{"text":"Ambiance same. Busy and noisy.  Service was adequate but rushed. The appetizer was served and could not be finished before the entree was served. Even the check was delivered before we were done with the meal. Rushed rushed rushed, and the food isn't that good to put up with it! I asked the waitress to make sure the food was HOT, explaining how it was lukewarm the last time and had to be sent back. The beef brisket and pulled pork was again served lukewarm. I would bet that the beef is precut and in a pan waiting for orders. The sausage was tasty and actually a hot temperature. The macaroni and cheese was also a disappointment. A layer of mozzarella lay slightly melted over some elbow macaroni and a watery sauce that was more like a soup than a cheesy wonder. The sweet potato fries were also lukewarm and the cream spinach must have been left in the microwave too long, as it was boiling hot.  I am even more critical of this place, having recently returned from Austin Texas where I had some REAL BBQ. The perfunctory service, along with the mediocre food confirms why they really deserve 2 stars and makes me scratch my head why people would give them more, other than the usual NC lack of a palette, so pervasive in the Tar Heel State or just simply not having another choice in the area other than Bojangles. I'm done though; strike 2 and your OUT!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered takeout from Smoke so this is a food-only review. Mind you, I just had the best BBQ of my life in Texas last weekend so perhaps an unfair time to be writing a review. :)   We ordered the combo for 2 which had 4 meats and 2 sides. It was the best deal on the menu. I was happy with all 4 meats, especially the ribs. It was good chain restaurant BBQ. Good flavoring, tender meat.  The sides we ordered were smoky slaw and mac n cheese. Both were worth ordering again although the mac n cheese was nothing to rave about. I just love mac n cheese.  I'm anxious to try their desserts.  I'm glad Huntersville is welcoming another good restaurant. I will eat here again! I just won't insist on taking any out of town guests that visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome in all aspects! Several visits and each time the staff was great, knowledgeable about the menu, sauces and wine. The outside patio is gorgeous, inside can get a little loud but, what restaurant can't be at times. The Cabano is my go to choice for an entree, mac and cheese is baked...= awesome! You can also call in take out for those nights when you don't feel like cooking. If you have not tried this place, please do."}
{"text":"This is seriously some of the BEST BARBECUE I'VE EVER HAD. In town from the west coast, stayed down the road for a conference and stopped in based on the YELP reviews. Smoke Modern did not disappoint! I had the brisket with mashed potatoes and spinach. The brisket had a dry rub and was cooked to perfection and so tender you don't even need a knife to cut it. The \"smashed\" potatoes were full of creamy, buttery deliciousness and while the spinach was not my favorite, I was so enamored by the rest that it didn't even matter. Great food, great service. If I ever come back to Huntersville again (probably a snowball's chance in hell) I'll make sure to stop in to Smoke Modern. If not, I'll always have my sweet, sweet memories."}
{"text":"This place is still great, but super disappointed that they stopped offering the Sunday brunch. Their pancakes were the best around by far."}
{"text":"If you are opening a BBQ restaurant, calling it \"modern\", and charging a premium then you had better deliver on at least two of the following: quality, uniqueness, or portion size. Unfortunately, it failed on all three. While smoke looks modern the food was mediocre, service was \"meh\", and portions were very..eh \"modern\".   I ordered the 2 meat combo ($18) with the Jalapeno Sausage and the Brisket. The sausage was actually pretty good and would potentially order again. However, the brisket was really dry and had minimal flavor. If done properly you shouldn't need BBQ sauce, but perhaps that's why they serve like 5 types on the table. Portion size was also sort of a joke, with just three thinly sliced pieces, all dry and lame there on this giant plate. I've gotten more meat on a subway sandwich.   Bottom line, you can't serve the same run-of-the-mill BBQ and sides you can get anywhere, with nothing unique or different about it, then call it modern and charge a premium. I felt ripped off to be honest,  hence the 2 rating, so will most likely not be going back."}
{"text":"Nice unique ambience, real good food especially for meat and seafood lovers. Good service and adequate parking."}
{"text":"Permanently closed. Too expensive and slow service. Food went downhill quickly also.  But the good thing is that Midwood Smokehouse is taking over the lease by the end of the summer."}
{"text":"This place was great! Cool atmosphere, you can smell the goodness when you walk in the place....all of the below were great!  Fried pickle app Buffalo chicken wings app Smoked sausage/pulled chicken combo plate with Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"We had really high hopes for Smoke. The place is pretty nice and the food was good but I don't think I'll be back much. Although the food was good, it's just BBQ. Overpriced BBQ. I think Mac's or Lancaster's does a better job for a much better price. The server was very nice but the timing of the food was rushed and then the actually BBQ items were cold. One person at our table had a very poor cut of ribs. The server replaced them very quickly and the new cut was delicious. Drinks were ok. Again, overpriced. In the end, I left feeling like I ate good BBQ but paid way too much. Their pork was the best BBQ item and all the sides were great (although there was a lack of greens). I see myself coming back to sit on the patio for a beer and ordering a pulled pork sandwich with friends before a movie or karaoke at the kilted buffalo."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Smoke Modern BBQ several times, both for lunch and dinner.  I'm surprised a Colorado restaurant decided to open a location in Huntersville, but I'm really glad they did!  We've tried their deviled eggs as an appetizer.  They were filled to overflowing and my husband loved them, but I didn't, because they had too much spicy mustard.  I guess it's a personal thing, because I prefer deviled eggs with the more subtle dry mustard.  We've had the pulled pork, brisket, and smoked chicken.  The pulled pork is my favorite, either on a platter or in a sandwich.  I actually think they have the BEST pulled pork in this area.  And that's saying a lot, because I'm also a fan of Mac's.  Smoke's accompanying cider coleslaw for the sandwiches is good and not sweet (yay!).  My husband liked both the brisket and chicken as well.  My favorite sides are their tater tots and cheddar grits (only available at dinner).  I'm not, however, a fan of their baked beans (too sweet), macaroni and cheese (too runny), and creamed spinach.    Smoke is a little pricey (for example, $10.95 for a lunch pork sandwich).  But the sandwiches are huge, and need I repeat that they are really good?  They offer carry-out, and we've taken advantage of that option as well.  Give them a try if you are looking for some great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Based on my first experience, a lot will depend on what you order. The service is outstanding. The best I have seen in a long time. The food depends.   I went with my son and we ordered a lot of different items. So, here's a rating system for those items with 5 being highest:   Caesar Salad: 4 Regular Wings: 4.5 Teriyaki Wings: 3 (too much Teriyaki) Roasted Chicken: 4 (more of an objective rating because I prefer dark meet and this was mostly white meet) Burger: 4 Fries: 4 Corn on the Cob: 3  And there you have it. Will update this review after next visit."}
{"text":"Snappy vibe inside, quieter-than-average noise level (at least when I was there), jazzy selection of drinks, and awesome menu options!   Burnt Ends Mac ($9.95) - Great spin on macaroni and cheese with mixed in brisket and freshly diced tomatoes. The pasta macaroni is atypically small and not normally the size used for traditional mac and cheeses. Didn't matter, this dish was rich and creamy (and superbly cheesy) in all the right ways.   Smoked Pulled Pork Sandwich ($10.95) - Pulled pork sandwiched in a heavily buttered brioche bun. Husband claimed the pulled pork wasn't moist enough and a bit dry."}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere paired with good vibes and awesome staff. The food was just mediocre though, we had the burnt ends that came highly recommended by our waiter (who was really good) but they did not impress, especially being at a BBQ based establishment! Just tough and didn't seem like high quality food. Ceasar salad was great though!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere- fair  Service fair-good  Food super southern and tastes great. Don't eat breakfast or lunch for you will get all your calories in this meal."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Smoke as it's near our home and I've heard good things about their food.  The restaurant is a beautiful place, with modern decor and a nice atmosphere.  We chose to sit outside and the patio is a nice place to dine.   We ordered a few things and I will review each;  Smoked wings-VERY good wings, on par with some of the best I've had (I enjoy smoked wings and have had them at several restaurants).  NOW the bad about the wings, we ordered a dozen with half sauced \"buffalo\" and the others \"Korean BBQ,\" each were VERY good.  The problem was one of the \"buffalo\" style was NOT a wing, not sure what it was, and really thought the waitress should have taken them back.  I showed this to her, and she basically ignored it.  I didn't push it as this was a father's day dinner with my wife and son.   More on this below.  We had the \"3 meat\" combo dish and chose ribs, brisket and smoked chicken;  Ribs-dry rubbed \"spare\" ribs, excellent smoke and bark.  I thought the ribs were very good and would get them again.     Brisket-it was only ok, it was dry and the flavor ok (I ordered \"half fatty/half lean\") the bark was ok, mainly just really dry and not much flavor.  I know brisket is tough to be consistent for a restaurant, but for a BBQ place, this was below average for sure.  Smoked Chicken-excellent and very tasty chicken, we would order this again for sure.    After our meal, I was really irritated with the waitress's non response on the wing \"thing.\"  I just felt she didn't handle it very well, and I wanted to make sure she understood why I was unhappy.  My wife asked if she could take care of it, so she went inside and asked to speak to the manager.  A person appeared from the back and presented themselves as the \"manager.\"  (My wife worked her way through school as a waiter, so she knows when another waiter becomes \"the manager\" and she thought this is what happened).  She basically was told the \"manager\" would speak to our waitress.    So, between the waitress and the \"manager\" and the wing \"thing,\"  our dining experience was far from positive.  The food overall was pretty good, but because there are a LOT of good BBQ places in Charlotte to choose from, we will go to those places that appreciate our business."}
{"text":"Let me say that the Mac and Cheese was very good. The rest of the meal was less than stellar. I ordered the three meat dinner. Ribs, Brisket and Pulled Pork. The ribs were very good but the portion was very small. I received 4 small bones from the end of the rack.  I ordered them dry and they didn't really need any sauce. The brisket was inedible. I know that brisket is extremely difficult to do well. That's why I go out for it. This brisket was tough and fatty. I believe that it was not sliced correctly and the slices were very thick. The cole slaw was unimpressive as well. It was chopped cabbage with very little flavor. The service was excellent but the server needs to bone up on the local brews. I asked a few questions trying to decide on a beer and she really couldn't answer any of them. With so many options for smoked meat in the Lake Norman area \"Smoke\" needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"Whole experience was decent. Server was nice, food was on the plain side and lacked flavor. My salmon tasted very burnt and the mashed potatoes were straight up garlic. Mac and cheese was decent. Food came out quick and something had to be sent back, but the fixed dish did not take long to prepare, though it was dry. I do not know if I will return."}
{"text":"Very delicious. Waitress very kind. Nice area. I got pulled chicken with Mac n cheese and beans. The mac n cheese could've used some more flavor. My husband got the fried catfish, which he enjoyed. My friend got the beef brisket..which was so delicious. I would've preferred it over my chicken. Many bbq sauces to choose from. Overall nice place to dine. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Great bbq I'd found so far in NC. Friendly staff and they have an outside seating that allows dogs which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"So funny story, there are 4 sauces on each table. I ask one of my coworkers to read off what they are, and this is what she says: \"Modern Barbeque, Modern Barbeque, Modern Barbeque, and, wow! Modern Barbeque!\"  Pro tip: the names of the sauces are on the other side of the bottles.  I came here for lunch with some work friends because it's within walking distance. The decor and vibe is really neat: there's exposed wood in the form of both planks and flattened tree bark (first time ever seeing this!), and high ceilings with a kind of industrial look to it. Our service was quick and really welcoming!   Of the four people, 3 of them got the Grilled Cheese Pulled Pork Sandwich (which looked awesome!) with different sides, but I got the Cuban with an upgraded side of the Burnt Ends Mac N Cheese. Holy hell.  The Cuban was their interpretation of a cuban, but had all the right ingredients and tasted like it belonged. I had a hard time not finishing the Burnt Ends, it took a lot of self restraint. I think they use whole grain noodles in their mac n cheese too, which gave it a neat kick.  Prices were on the higher side for an everyday lunch, but you get what you pay for. Sit down service, cool decor, and excellent food all make this a destination that I'll be returning to to try out the rest of their menu! I love working next to Birkdale.."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we really enjoyed it. The Waiter was super nice and the meats even better. We had a platter for three and shared that with a few sides. The potatoes are to die for. I like the fatty brisket the best but it was all very good"}
{"text":"We've been looking for good barbecue since moving here from Los Angeles and we finally found the place.  We started with the nachos with brisket.  We devoured them without a word and could have kept eating them...  The spouse had the prime rib philly cheesesteak and couldn't stop eating it.  That coupled with the tater tots was the perfect meal.  I had the four meats and lets just say I took two of the four meats home with me.  The pulled barbecue chicken was amazing and the ribs just full right off the bone.  Couple those with the KC barbecue sauce and it was amazing.  I took a bite of the brisket which was great.  They gave me a side of the smoke coleslaw that was also great.  The Mac and Cheese was perfect too!    Now lets talk about the service.  The manager Alexis greeted us when we walked in and recognized me as the one that made the reservation.  We were seated within two minutes and had exceptional service by Caitlin.  She made great recommendations, was there with a refill of my iced tea and even brought water for my spouse who had ordered an adult beverage.  If you want great service, great food and good atmosphere this is the place to be.  I do recommend you make a reservation, so you don't have to wait to be seated.  They were crowded!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dear sweet baby Jesus! The best BBQ around! 5 stars for the food! We love this place! I have not had a bad meal here! The smokin' slaw is to die for! And the Grilled Cheese pulled pork sandwich?? I drooled just typing that!  The atmosphere of the place is very modern. I love it. Booths are comfy and bar area is comfortable to sit in as well!  Service is hit and miss otherwise it'd be a 5 star review but the delicious food does make up for it sometimes!   Keep doing what you're doing Smoke!"}
{"text":"From start to finish it was amazing.  Shannon \"Brickhouse\" was exceptional.  He was flawless.  Even the manager came by to make sure everything was perfect. The food was delicious, portion sizes were a lot more than we anticipated (not a bad thing ever), and my favorite was the shrimp and bacon Mac N Cheese. yummmm. Ambiance was great. We would definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was great. We came from out of town. Dave was awesome, friendly, and gave great recommendations. We had mixed drinks that were perfect! The brisket was oh so delicious. Pulled pork was good. My friend had the sausage, which I tried, and again delicious. The modern decor was aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend a stop by, will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Second time here...excellent food...wings were amazing!  James did an excellent job as our server....  Definitely will come back..."}
{"text":"Wow, I walk in & thought this place looks great. Love the decor, but quickly realized the staff is the weak link. We order a meal to go, so I thought I'd try the bar & special cocktail while I waited. Well, it became evident that this place lacked any kind of real service. Which doesn't jive with other reviews, so I'll write my review & you can chalk it off to one bad experience. Saw a couple of interesting cocktails. But the girl behind bar was more interested in talking to her friend sitting @ the bar. The manager & another waiter, who were behind the bar, just looked @ me when I sat down, then the manager walked away. This is the first clue it's a top down problem. After waiting awhile, I just got up & left. This was not the beginning of the poor service. I felt I was putting somebody out every time I interacted with a staff member. Definitely got the impression I was interrupting the staff. Hopefully the foods better than the service."}
{"text":"Smoke is a great place if your trying to go somewhere better than Chilis but not as expensive as Red Rocks Cafe. The food at Smoke surpasses both of the venues above and seem to have a nice staff. I have been there several times now and it appears that the food is always top notch but somehow my drink always gets messed up. Ive noticed its a combination of the server putting it in wrong and the bartender leaving off garnishes like candied bacon which was why i ordered the drink. The one star deduction was for the bar even though they have some unique and interesting drinks."}
{"text":"Out of town for business. Sat outside, food wasn't WOW, but the meat had great taste and atmosphere was very relaxed! Wish the brisket bites had a bit more meat instead of fat."}
{"text":"Man, what a great find. Wasn't sure what to expect with a name like \"modern barbecue\", but we were pleasantly surprised. Great laid back atmosphere, plenty of beers on draft or bottle, great menu. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had never been to smoked, but it smelled so good outside that we had to go in. First, they had a 1/2 price wine special. Kevin Parks was our bar tender. He let me taste a few before I decided on their meritage. He made a great suggestion in the brisket sandwich.  My wife loved her BBQ chicken salad. While we really enjoyed the food, what will bring us back is the great service by Kevin. Such a pleasant, helpful, knowledgeable and energetic young man. Hard to find outstanding service in many places today, but Kevin will provide it at Smoke Modern BBQ."}

{"text":"Been twice now.  Once during their soft opening for a Friends and Family night that featured a pared down menu and again for dinner a couple weeks ago.  There were some great, good, ok aspects with both visits.  On the barbecue front, I give an overall good rating.  This would be opposed to their sister restaurant Midwood Smokehouse getting a \"great\" from me on cue quality.  Thus far I've tried the jalapeno sausage, pulled pork and brisket and I would rate them 1, 2, 3 in that order.  There's much more than BBQ on the menu that I have yet to try.  Some of the sides I've tried have been very, very good.  Best so far - the Smokin' Slaw and the Mac N Cheese.  When you go Mac N Cheese, go for one of the speciality versions.  The one with burnt ends was just fantastic and I could not stop shoveling it in my maw even though I was already full.  In terms of service, the soft opening night brought a young girl who had no where near the training needed to work at another sister restaurant, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, much less at a somewhat upscale place.  The second trip brought a superstar named Kevin who wasn't even assigned our table but noticed we had been sitting a couple minutes without water and took it from there.  He was exceptional.  All in all, Smoke will be a good addition to Birkdale Village and I would expect them to get better with age."}
{"text":"Been here twice and really enjoyed it!  Make sure you get the deviled eggs as an appetizer!  They are truly amazing.  As far as other foods go the pulled pork and jalapeno sausage are excellent, but their brisket needs some work.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and they have a great drink menu.  Can't wait till my next trip!"}
