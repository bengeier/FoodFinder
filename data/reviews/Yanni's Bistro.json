{"text":"I was on my way to another Greek restaurant about a half a mile away when I spied Yanni's Greek Bistro. (This restaurant was not on Google.) I went in and looked at the menu. I thought it was a little spendy for a gyro - $9.00. The very nice and friendly lady behind the counter assured me that it was well worth it. She said everything was fresh-made everyday. Then, she gave me a sample of the tzatziki sauce. SOLD! My taste buds were in 7th Heaven. I ordered the traditional lamb and beef gyro. I could just taste the freshness in every delicious bite I took. When I finished, not one piece of food was left on my plate! 
(One time I ate at a Greek restaurant on Charleston and Buffalo. The onions that they put on the gyro tasted like sweaty armpits. I have never gone back there because of this.)
The nice lady behind the counter had told me that this gentleman owner had previously  owned another restaurant on South Las Vegas Boulevard but chose to retire. Then luckily, he got bored and came out of retirement and opened up this restaurant. Yay!! 
It is very clean, quaint and inviting inside this restaurant. And the food.... Well, it was the best gyro I have ever eaten! 
People of Henderson are very lucky to have such a wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, our waitress was very sweet and attentive. The food was also very good and came out in a timely manner. I'll admit it was a bit confusing since the sign that was put outside of the door stated it was going to be a French restaurant. So just FYI, this restaurant has Mediterranean food and French options as well as pastries for dessert. It wasn't disappointing though, confusing, yes, but it just provides you with more options so I would say it's a good thing. I ordered the braised lamb chops, which was very good, and their lentil soup. Overall a good experience, and I will come back to try their French options next time."}
{"text":"Delicious and very cute dining in least expected spot.Portions were generous, service was swift and very pleasant.Highly recommened..."}
{"text":"Two friends and I decided to try the new French bistro in Henderson. We're glad we did because we loved it. Done or one ordered. An appetizer of chive cream cheese wrapped in salmon that was absolutely delicious. So was the yellow lentil soup  ($6) with the puff pastry rolls on the side. Diner two and I started all with a delicious cheesy French onion soup  ($8)  then ordered  the chicken Cordon Bleu ($15) which comes with a delicious Lemon butter  sauce -and a little cup of extra sauce. The chicken breast was on a bed of creamed vegetables nestled in a puff pastry square.  A little side salad with terrific raspberry vinaigrette was fresh and made this an excellent choice  
Service from our waitress,  Ruby Tuesday, yes that's really her name, was spot on. She stayed with us to make sure we didn't well taken care of without being intrusive and she had a great bubbling personality. We loved her.  
Yanni was closing tonight for about two weeks while they revamp to add a Greek  menu along with the delicious French cuisine.  Looking forward to that because we all love Greek food.
The menu is small but that was OK because we had a tough time choosing between three or four things that sounded so good,  but fortunately we live in the neighborhood can return to try the rest of the menu.
Do give this new place a try. I think you'll like it. It's located at the far end of the Kmart shopping plaza on Eastern and Coronado Center Drive."}
