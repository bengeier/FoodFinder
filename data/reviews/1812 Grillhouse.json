{"text":"This place was great. The atmosphere was very warm - you saw all types of groups from families, large parties to couples, the decorations were rustic and the live music was really the cherry on top. 

The server was friendly and remembered all our names, which was pretty darn impressive.  Our table ordered everything from ribs, chicken and waffles, burgers, chicken fingers to a dish off the gluten free menu.  They were all exactly as advertised and tasted great! The server made some awesome recommendations and beer pairings too.

My portion of ribs and two sides was enough for dinner and a hearty lunch the next day. No one had room for dessert but from what I've seen, it looked incredible. I'd love to try the funnel cake.  

It's located in a kind of obscure area, but that didn't stop the place from being busy! 

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time...
Went in as a group and were talked into a buffet.  Unfortunately they didn't make enough food for everyone, and when we complained, we were told there was nothing they could do about it.  Apparently they weren't making any money off of us.  Well, neither my wife or I ate, yet they had no problem charging us the $35.00 each, and then had the nerve to complain when I didn't add a tip.  Unbelievable.  Worst service I've ever experienced anywhere.  Won't step foot back in this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's in the middle of nowhere so you kind of  have to make it your destination but so worth it. My favorite are the lobster and shrimp po boy, crawfish bisque (super messy trying to get the Crawford out of its shell but so tasty), lobster poutine, and the gartic fries.  The prices there aren't very expensive either like the lobster and shrimp po boy is only $16 which they serve with a huge portion of fries (I never finish the whole thing and end up packing half to take home). My friends like the hush puppies, chicken and waffles, and the lobster mac and cheese.  Their food is so tasty and flavorful, I haven't tried everything on their menu but I feel like you can't go wrong with ordering anything there.  
The only drawback is that they are so out of the way from everything which makes it a bit of a trek to get to sometimes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I will hit this place up on our way up to the cottage, the food is always amazing and the service has always been top notch! They have a solid menu with creative seasonal cocktails and will have themed specials through out the summer (I'm guessing all year long but we're just there in the summer). For full on entrees the pricing is reflective of a 'nice dinner out' for us as a young couple but there's options that are still so filling and delicious. Definitely the best place for miles around, we always look forward to stopping here!"}
{"text":"Cute spot for dinner or drinks/appetizers. Nice decor for a modern country/farmhouse feel. Huge portions. Tried the chicken and waffles- safe to say I got a 3/4 of a chicken, couldn't finish it. So glad I got to try it, will be back to try something different.

Look them up on instagram, they tend to offer certain features and prefix menus from time to time which are worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Rustic, southern, deliscious. I travelled south from Barrie. To Daniel S's remark, raped and killed is more rare here then where he is likely from- opt his restaurant is on highway 27. North of Schomburg.

They have great beer- their pickles are hand breaded, salads are great, we had chicken fried steak and brisket sandwich, the steak was deliscious, came exactly as advertised. The brisket was on an extremely fresh flattish bread, great applewood sauce- was great! Their fries are spiced and hand cut.

If you are looking for something unique and off the beaten path, this is it!

Enjoy,

And disregard Daniel S's review, totally innapropriate."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! With great staff! We had some appetizers which could totally be a full meal!!! Lobster Mac&Cheese is a winner!!! So is the Jimbalaya!!! 1812 Grillhouse will definitely see us again!!!"}
{"text":"This place can be best described as inconsistent. Most of the time it's an excellent choice with unique menu options, other times it's WTF happened here. 1812 is a rare find in a rural area. Most place just serve the same few dishes. This place has those too, but a lot of southern cooking options you wouldn't be expecting. They also have different festivals throughout the year like 'seafood boil', 'south of the border' and many others that offer even more variety. Most of the time you get excellent portion size and high quality ingredients. Tonight I had a shrimp and lobster burrito and a craft beer from Collingwood. Just amazing. In the past I've had chicken and waffles, meatloaf, sandwiches and burgers, catfish and eggs breakfast, beignets. Just a great choice. 

However other times things haven't been great. There was the time they charged me .75Â¢ extra for hot sauce (still bent about that, it's southern cooking after all).  Then there was a seafood special that charged $20 for four shrimp and some fries. They seriously under delivered. 

You really must go, because they're doing great work. I just hope the right people doing things the right way are in the night you come."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal when we come here.  I wish the onion rings were all-u-can-eat.  They are the best.  I usually follow that up with a burger.  The best low key dinner well worth the drive out of town for."}
{"text":"Yum!  Great 1812 Beef Brisket Sandwich with Mac & Cheese.  Fried pickle appetizer with ranch was delicious!   The guys had the Bourbon St Pepoercirn Steak with 2 sides.  Corn and fries on one and mac/cheese with fries on the other steak.   We'll come back from Toronto for a meal.  
Great live music until 11PM.   Also, the Mayweather vs McGregor fight was on! Great dinner break stop from Lake Superior vacation back to Toronto. Close to the 400 Hwy/88"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. Both meals were great. Service the second time around was pretty rough which was strange considering we had the same server both times.  We've had oysters, chicken fried steak, hush puppies, the cracked chicken, onion rings, fried pickles, jambalaya, lobster Mac and cheese as well as a burger. The only thing I won't order again is the chicken fried steak, it was fine but there are other twenty dollar entrees that are better on their menu.  The food is very good the prices a decent, we are going back in a couple days with another group of people."}
{"text":"Myself along with three other people went for lunch. Out of the four of us, only three ordered as one wasn't hungry. We got there around 12:30 on a Sunday and it was completely dead. Our server told us all she had had that day other than us was a takeout order - regardless our server was lovely. I should mention that the atmosphere of this place is great. I could imagine how lively it gets a nighttime. Overall, really pleasing aesthetic. 

For our meal, none of us ordered an appetizer to start, however we all ordered drinks (two pops, a sweat tea, a glass of wine and a pint of beer). The one who ordered the sweat tea really enjoyed it! The drinks arrived to us quickly which was appreciated. Our meals also came quick, but this is where we were disappointed. One ordered the lobster and shrimp dip (as their meal), which came out very hot (good!) and cheesy (also good!)  however otherwise was bland. Another ordered the 1812 brisket burger. The fried pickle that came with it was very good, however the burger wasn't anything special, and the fries were awful. We had to send back the plate nearly full of fries when done because it was as though they were just soaked in oil. They we limp and greasy, and everything you don't want when it comes to french fries. The last meal was probably the best, and still wasn't excellent. It was the lobster poutine. The gravy was good, and there were big chunks of lobster, however the lobster was overly flaky and almost tasted mushy which was disappointing. While the waffle fries were much crispier than the ones that accompanied the burger, they were over seasoned and too salty. 

Overall, we were not impressed with our meal, which was too bad since looking at the reviews, many people have really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Stuck out on a country road, 1812 is a quaint thematic roadhouse, with rustic interior, licence plates on the wall, and lots of charm.  I stopped in with an associate for a quick dinner after a busy day.  There was one server on duty, two guys at the bar and one family of 4.  Service was a bit on the slow side based on the work load.

The menu is pretty interesting.  There are some very non-roadhouse non-barfood offerings.  I had the Lobster & Shrimp Po Boy, and my associate had the Braised Beef Sammy.  We split the meals to have a sampling of each.  The Po Boy had some of the freshest and most perfectly cooked seafood, just not a lot of it.  The Beef Sammy was fairly generous on the beef, but also a bit too generous on the untrimmed fat.

The special caught my eye--a Sirloin Burger for $5!  Add cheese for a dollar more and I had to order one just to try it.  This is a substantial burger, well charred, and makes the fake beef pucks from McD's look absolutely pathetic.  See the photo if you don't believe me!

This is what I call a \"magnet joint\"--if I am anywhere in the area, I will be attracted to 1812.  A bit more polishing and a bit more attention from the service staff, and I could bump 1812 up to 5 stars!

Update:  stopped in for a quick meal. I opted for the Lobster Mac & Cheese. It arrived in a large casserole dish, with curly macaroni, and a chunk of cornbread. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was smooth and nicely lobster flavoured.  The downside:  I didn't find a single piece of lobster. I did see the occasional fiber of what looked like lobster, but without some hearty chunks, I couldn't be sure. 1812 seems to have a great menu, but so far every dish stopped at 95% of outstanding. A few tweaks, and 1812 could be a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes. After reading the reviews and looking at the menu online, I was excited. 

I've lived in the southern US and travelled across the US. 

My first impression was that it smelled like a cow pasture outside. I thought hmmm. Fresh.  I understand that in a rural setting that's out of control. 

We ordered the corn muffins and nachos to start. 

The muffins were delicious but a little pricey at $7 for only three muffins. They should be served and included with your meals. 

The nachos were only average. Tostitos with some cheese and toppings. 

I ordered the chicken fried steak. It lacked flavor. Needed salt for sure. And it was thick. Really kinda thick. Not what a chicken fried steak is supposed to be. It should be pounded thin. 

Someone else in my party had the jambalaya and didn't finish because it had a strange flavor. 

We also had the meatloaf which was really good. 

One of the people in our party ordered a blueberry mojito. It was flavorless and wasn't finished. It only tasted like soda. 

For three people the total care to over $100. And I will probably not return. 

Also there was live music when we came. It was so loud, even the waitress couldn't hear us when we tried to order"}
{"text":"On Sunday, Aug. 14/17, attended with partner, daughter and her husband.  We were treated to a live singer-guitarist who was quite good at bellowing out songs from the 60s through to current times.  

We started off with the onion rings which was the best I have ever had. I had the Jambalaya Louisiana which was very tasty and my partner had the Lobster and Shrimp Po' Boy which was also tasty. She was a bit surprised to see it in a bun as it didn't mention it on the menu. Daughter and son in law had a salad with scrimp and a burger respectfully. Both seemed to enjoy their meals as well. We finished sharing a couple of slices of cake which we all agreed was also very good.

Only criticism that all of had was the portion sizes were a bit on the small size, even though, we are all on diets. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Drove past this place completely randomly.


We had 8 dishes each was fantastic.


Only negative thing I could say is that there wasn't a diaper changing station for kids onsite."}
{"text":"1812 Grillhouse is a restaurant that specializes in southern comfort food. It is situated kiiiinda in the middle of nowhere (in Bradford, just north of Schomberg, on the side of a highway.) We had heard some good things, so we decided to trek out from Toronto to check it out. 

The interior has that country-like vibe. Wooden tables and furniture, with a pub like ambiance. There's also a little shop near the right of the entrance that sells assorted knick knacks and is worth checking out (there was a banana nut candle that smelt so delicious I wanted to eat it.)

We started off with some mixed drinks but no one was particularly pleased with theirs. I felt mine was a bit watery. I drank about a quarter of it and gave up and went to non-alcoholic drinks for the rest of the night. 

Food-wise, here's what we had:

Deep Fried Pickles: if I see this on the menu I cannot NOT order it. The pickles were super yummy and very juicy, but the breading fell off and they were very lightly coated. 

Chicken n Waffles: Two small pieces do boneless breaded chicken (one white meat and one dark meat). The chicken was okay. The waffles were nothing special and I think they maybe frozen/pre made. Very lacking in flavour and served with both syrup and strawberry sauce. I usually eat my chicken and waffles in the same bite so I left most of the strawberry sauce alone. I found myself thinking that I've had better chicken & waffles at chain restaurants. 

Meat platter trio: 3 small portions of fried chicken, steak, and sausage. Again, okay, but nothing really stood out as special. 

Peanut butter pie: quite yummy with the consistency of cheesecake. 

Pumpkin brÃ»lÃ©e: mmm. This was the highlight of the meal. All the awesome parts of pumpkin pie mixed with the amazingness of creme brÃ»lÃ©e. I would eat a vat of this stuff. Plus, who doesn't love cracking the sugar top!?

Overall, it was an okay meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but if I was in the area I'd give it a second try (to try the shark!)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed some good eats at this restaurant. 

Visited on a Saturday and found the service to be alright. Visited again in a diff Saturday and the service improved greatly. 

I've sampled their Mac and cheese, lobster and shrimp poboy, crawfish bisque, cornbread, chicken and waffles, dirty rice, deep fried pickles and the blueberry lemon sweet tea. my faves were the chicken & waffles and the Mac and cheese. the bisque had a tex Mex taste and the poboy was good but not authentic to Louisiana style. Good none the less but definitely not comparable to the south... or at least the south that I've come to know and love. The cornbread was soooooooo yummy; it was infused with rosemary which was new and exciting to me. 

you should 100% order the pickles. 

I'll return again fo sho. They are decently priced, flexible with ressos and have a good atmosphere from entry to exit. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"We drove by a few times and decided to go in one stormy night

Great service tasty food.. we had the wings... I mean drumsticks.. they make drumsticks in the same way you would have wings.. so meaty and crispy and affordable! Had enough for.leftovers 

Entertainment guitarist was nice to have in the background as we ate.

Our 2 yrs old was welcomed and we really enjoyed the food and have promoted it ever since"}
{"text":"July 2017 - A quick lunch on a Sunday drive. This was a great find.
We decided on sharing a few appetizers and ordered Crispy Deep-Fried Garlic/Dill Pickles with a Cucumber dipping sauce, Lobster Poutine on Lattice fries & white Gravy and Grilled Shrimp and Roasted Crawfish in a Tomato Butter sauce with corn on the cob and sweet corn bread.
We were very impressed with each of the items and the good service we got from Kelly, our server."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 3.5. Service was great and accommodating (allowed us to sample the chococherry stout and also gave a scoop of ice cream on the side with coconut rum cake). Waitress (Jess?) was very attentive and friendly! 

We ordered lemon blueberry sweet tea, Santa rita wine,  shrimp & crawfish app, memaw's meatloaf, peppercorn steak, brownie bottom cookie dough cheesecake, and coconut rum cake. All were pretty good except for the steak. It's a cheap cut and pounded very thin, which made it hard to be cooked rare. It was served to us closer to medium done. It wasn't that great and definitely not worth the $25 price tag. At most I would consider this a $15 meal or just removed from the menu completely to focus more on the southern food items.

The sweet tea and appetizer were the best part of the meal. The dessert was okay but nothing stunning and a little overpriced ($10/each). At best it should cost $6 or $7. The coconut rum cake would be better paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and woukd be more appetizing. I would definitely consider ordering the meatloaf again but would probably try other items from the menu. The mac and cheese side was extremely underwhelming and plain. 

Overall the atmosphere was cozy and it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"At the 1812...the burgers taste good and the fries are home made. They're service was good but mostly because it was dead. Even though it was dead the waitress was very kind. Their dishes are a normal size but will fill you up. Their onion rings are delicious and nice and big which is good.there Apple cider is nice and hot for a cold fall day."}
{"text":"The last two times we went, the service was good, but the food was not, and the atmosphere was uncomfortable. The last time we went, there was a performer who was very obviously drunk and was not only singing half songs and swearing, but he sang a Christmas song and then devolved further into a rape joke. What was worse, was that they kept him on stage. Horribly loud and offensive content - not a good date night spot.

The chicken and waffles were dry and over cooked, and but otherwise the hush puppies were delicious. I heard they have been removed from the menu, but also that the removal was temporary. Go at your own risk. 

Would have previously received 5 stars, but things have changed in the past two years - and not for the better."}
