{"text":"Great service and food. Not to be missed. Authentic, neighborhood restaurant with an owner that really cares about his clients."}
{"text":"Meals are started with a salad as well, which is, let's face it, for physiological purposes only. After eating the amount of preceding meat, you're going to need a kick start to get it moving through your system. If you're going to eat here, you know that carnage will be eaten by the plate fulls and vegetables will just be an insult to your colon.


The mixed seafood plate - which consisted of grilled squid, shrimps and a whole sardine. Whole sardine means that there's bones in the fish with the head on, as opposed to the boneless and headless kinds that swim around, so be comfortable with the fact of manipulating a fish carcass on your plate.


There was a little 'Je ne sais quoi\" about the fries, they were sweet to the taste and crunchy to the bite. Despite the fact that they were a greasy and marvelous - which in some weird way, I felt that the fries NEEDED to be greasy - they managed to work well with the seafood. The squid was cooked perfectly. They were crunchy and NOT RUBBERY. There isn't anything worse than feeling like you're chewing on a mouth full of extension cord."}
{"text":"Great food. Great wine.. Affordable healthy lunch. We recommend the sea food platter for two, come with salad and fries on the side"}
{"text":"After our meeting, we were looking for a
Neighborhood meat bbq to stave off the traffic rush hour  and ended up at Galo, where they flame grill everything Portuguese style, in the Town of Mount Royal neighborhood (aka TMR).  

The patio was inviting and ready for business with the white tables, red chairs, placemats and menus.  Overall, the Restaurant was extremely clean and the owner, also happened to be our waiter.  He was so proud of his menu, that he was walking us through the bbq options and his favourites.  The restaurant started to get very busy as we sat and service was super fast and very friendly.

We ordered two appetizers: the chargrilled sardines and the ultra-tender broiled calamari which were fantastic and were a great start to the meat bbq fest to come.    Next, came our dishes: flame grilled half chicken with rice and my three meat combo which included a spicy sausage, pork filet and a quarter chicken; the whole plate was phenomenal and tasted amazing!!!! The meal came with a bowl
Of back to basics salad: tomatoes, olives, red onions, red and green peppers, green and black olives, mint, romaine lettuce, with lemon, oil and vinegar tossed in; hmmmmmm! I dipped the freshly baked Portuguese buns at the bottom of the bowl
To mop up the sauce, Italian style, that's how good it was... 

Finishing the meal with rice pudding and the traditional flame grilled Portuguese egg tart was #FoodPorn on two tiny plates!    Full but not bloated, we will definitely return.  And now that the traffic rush hour is over, we can get back on the highway...What a nice detour this was, mangia, mangia!!!"}
{"text":"Petit resto portugais sympathique, parfait pour une date. 

La nourriture est excellente, mes croquettes de morue bien cuite et goûteuses. En entrée le calmar frit se laissait déguster.

Excellent service, menu typiquement portugais, déco soignée. 

Je recommande fortement ce resto de cartier si vous avez envie de manger portugais.


Nice little restaurant with good portugese food perfect for a date.

My cod nuggets were tasty and well done, the squid as appetizers was tasty.

Highly recommended if you like Portuguese food."}
{"text":"Very good Portuguese restaurant 
Nice variety of grilled fish and meat
Chicken, chaurizo, pork nice.
Love their octopus and calamari
Nice selection of Portuguese wines
They deliver in TMR"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in TMR! This place if very good for lunch and supper! They now offer delivery so I am an even bigger fan! We usually get the family dinner which is a complete steal! For 40$ tax included, you get a Portugueuse chicken, large fries, bread, house salad and their piri piri sauce! This meal feeds about 4-5 people and you are very full afterwards! The owners are very nice. Their chicken sandwich at lunch is amazing & sangria!"}
{"text":"Very good Portuguese chicken joint. Aside from the chicken, they have delicious lamb chops, mixed grill plates and grilled calamari. A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned restaurant with good Portuguese chicken & seafood. i went with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere along with the menu and prices."}
{"text":"A small place with the charm of Portugal. Being of Portuguese descent i am the first to say this is authentic Canadian-Portuguese fare. This place is smack in the middle of upper-middle class town of Mont-Royal in suburban Montréal, a trek without a car for us.  My girlfriend and I shared a three meat platter that came with rice fries and a side salad. The meats were traditional flame grilled chicken, chorizo (spicy sausage) and pork cutlets. I found the rice  (but oddly enough tasted like what my grandfather makes at home) but all three meat were cooked to perfection and delicious. Although I did not try their specials or their seafood both looked really delicious and i would recommend them. Also if you drink pop get sumol which is like Portuguese fanta."}
{"text":"Since the new ownership, the food is much better. The chicken is tender with a nice crisp skin. It's spiced just right but if you want a little more zing they offer you a really good piri-piri sauce.

 The fries are homemade and are good without being too greasy. The grilled sardines and chorizos are good too. And they serve great portuguese buns which have a nice crust and a great chew to the bread. Awesome for dipping in some piri-piri or making a sandwich with your chorizo or chicken. Speaking of sandwiches, they make those too. Although, I never had them they look really tasty.

I usually order for pick up but the restaurant is very inviting and quaint. The owners are friendly when I pick up the food. They also have delivery option.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Portuguese chicken, fries, bread, and salad; plus their amazing spicy piri piri sauce makes a meal for 4 people really easy and filling. For take-out or delivery the price is $33 plus tax (+ tip) which is a steal. You get a whole chicken, cut up and grilled, basted with an oily, slightly spicy concoction, a large salad and fries, plus 4 of the most delicious Portuguese buns (baked daily by a great bakery). The meat was still juicy, and the fries were the slightly soft, dark brown, style that Montrealers seem to love. I didn't think of it at the time, but a little squeeze of lemon over the chicken might even kick it up an additional notch. There was nary a fry or lettuce leaf left when we were done eating, a sign of a quality meal."}
{"text":"Very nice family restaurant. The place is very small around 40 seats. You can feed a family of 4 for under 40$ with the family chicken meal ( you get a salad ,  4 breads,  fries and a whole chicken portugese style...) 
Its ideal for a take out or delivery too...in the menu you will also find grilled Calamari, pork chops fish(the sardine is very popular but served complete with head and bones)....
Overall its a nice little place in the center of the town of Mount-Royal, most of the clientele are locals.
In the summer they have a small little terrace."}
{"text":"Galo is nice, cosy and at the same very busy local restaurant in TMR. Great staff, very tasty grilled chicken and good food in general. You are not going there for gastronomy but more for a good meal in a pleasant environment. It's also kids friendly"}
{"text":"Delicious food. It's in the neighbour, shame for me just tried out first time. Very surprisingly good. Reasonable price, actually for what you are getting the price is good. Did not try the Portuguese chicken, will be next visit. The steak and lamb are delicious. Highly recommend."}
