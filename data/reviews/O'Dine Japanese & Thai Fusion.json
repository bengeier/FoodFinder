{"text":"Flavourless pad Thai. Terrible. One of my favourite dishes and I had to force it down."}

Amazing Cold Rolls (Appetizers)"}
{"text":"best food, best service, great location , wonderful staff. the food is different and very good , you have to try the coconut soup and Odine roll for sure!!!!!! beef rolled asparagus is amazing too.great for its price."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and what a waste of money! Padthai had no flavour, no peanuts, no taste of tamarind just garbage! Taufoo was just four pieces lightly fried..really? The beef had no enoki or green onions just rolled and fried with some sauce. Nothing Thai should be name of this joint."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and then now. I like this place. They have both Thai and Japanese food. How else can you enjoy a Pad thai and maki rolls at the same time?

Their Golden Thai Curry was good. I got it to go and the vegetables in it were cooked just right. The chicken was normal. Shreds as I cut it. Flavour was fantastic and spice was just how I like. Not too hot, but had a bite. 

The Pad Thai noodles were thin, the flavour was good. Wasn't too sour nor too sweet. The sauce and noodle ratio was a good balance.

I got the bento box and a maki roll and i was satisfied with my order. I barely touched the rice but it was cooked well. 

Perfect place when you can't make up your mind between having thai food and japanese food. They also serve domestic beer too. They had la Rocca cakes, and you will notice it in their glass fridge right when you walk in."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, always fresh and delicious. I have never had a bad meal here and I go quite often. Try the Wonton Soup, it's the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fusion restaurant in Ajax. The menu is a bit random, with everything from Hakka, Thai to Japanese. The specials are pretty good for the price point, but the overall quality of the dishes are OK. I don't think I'll be returning but I'm glad I tried it out. 


Service - 3.5/5

{"text":"It has an extensive menu, so I knew everyone would find something they liked. It was a bright, beautifully decorated venue with lots of windows and comfortable seating. The menu is huge. Luckily, a few of us had checked it out online to narrow down the choices. For others, it took easily 10 minutes to get through it; a downside to a large menu. 

Being the indecisive, birthday girl that I am, I went with a Bento box. Dumplings, sushi, chicken teriyaki AND tempura? How could I go wrong? It was fantastic. The California rolls were very fresh and better than any AYCE California roll I've had. The dumplings were meaty and delicious. I couldn't finish all of the tempura, 2 shrimp and 4 veggie. The chicken teriyaki was meaty with broccoli, carrots, bean sprouts and lots of sauce. 

Everyone enjoyed their meals, except my boyfriend. He ordered the Ginger Beef, but he didn't expect there to be so much actual ginger in it. He spent the first 5 minutes picking it all out. It was a little too potent. Everyone else enjoyed their Mango Chicken, Thai Spicy Noodles with Beef, Yellow Thai Spicy Chicken and Maki meals. 

The servers are very attentive and polite. All of the food arrive hot and at the same time."}
{"text":"we go here a few times while we are in Canada ... staff sucks! do not expect smiling friendly service... love the soup and salad staff is always different.  Our last visit was not memorable and we might skip for awhile till they get it together my husbands steak was like leather ... good luck"}
{"text":"We've tried this place a few times and it was decent. cheap prices but the food reflects it. Tonight we tried the whole meal to send back some tuna rolls but no one checked on the food once it was delivered. We're pretty easy going people so my wife told them when they finally came by with the bill that the tuna didn't taste fresh. The waiter was rude, tried to tell us we were wrong, asked if we wanted new Tuna - we said we were full and maybe earlier in the meal we would have taken a replacement. He seemed really inconvenienced by us and eventually said he would ask his manager about taking those rolls off. He came back and said there was nothing wrong with the tuna and maybe we just didn't like tuna.....we have tuna rolls quite frequently and these tasted gross. He then offered desert instead which we said no to. The bill came with the tuna rolls still charged on it. Honestly I don't care about 5 dollars - but we won't go back. Odine may have saved a couple bucks by not discounting it, but they lost some customers. I would avoid. If you want good Thai go to i-Thai in Whitby, or for sushi go to makimono in Ajax. Not this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my top 3 spots in Ajax. Every dish I've gotten has been delicious! I'm not sure if it is authentic Thai/Japanese, however the flavours taste great to me. The service has always been great, and I've been here about 15 times. It's a great casual, local spot. 
I love the spicy miso soup, pad Thai, udon noodles, balsamic chicken, etc... definitely try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food!  This place has just about anything you want...Thai, Japanese, Sushi.   Everything I have tried is good, but I don't eat Sushi ;)

They also have some great cocktails and a good beer selection"}
{"text":"There is one menu where you can get for a fixed-price two entrees and two appetizers with two small dishes of ice cream for dessert we order from. It is always excellent. The service is decent as are the prices. There is ample parking. I have yet to try the bento box options and plan on doing so as they look delicious when I see them brought to other guests tables. We have been coming here for a few years and consider this place a decent place to go to when looking for a nice meal close to home."}
{"text":"The food is a little bit pricey, but it was good. They have a good variety of choices (Japanese, Western, Thai, etc.)."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my walk back from Wal-Mart (too many lines and busy around holiday season) instead of cooking dinner I ordered a take out from O'dine and was pleasantly surprised. The pineapple rice (asked to omit shrimp due to seafood allergy) and beef & broccoli was very tasty with fresh crisp broccoli.  Came to $ 22 and easily serves 3. 

I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been a consistent customer since they opened, absolutely love the food (although salmon sashimi slices could be a little thinner). However - my last few experiences have been disappointing, particularly due to the staff. I suspect that they behaved this way since I noticed that the owner who is usually present is not around. He is very friendly might i add.
We were there for a late dinner on quite a busy friday night, when they close at 11pm. We were the last (or one of the last) at 10:45pm when the staff abruptly turned the lights/music/tv off, began cleaning the floors rudely in front of us, and one of the waitresses said \"SORRY WE CLOSE NOW\" trying to get us to leave. As we left, she muttered BYE in a snarky way, as if she was happy we were finally leaving so she could go home. 
This was the same server who barely listened to our order, and when I tried to order green tea ice cream I could barely get her attention and ran off before I could even finish the order. 
In general, the owner/manager is very friendly, but he needs to hire new waitresses or train them better. 2 stars for that experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the Basil Chicken Fried Rice lunch special and it is definitely the worst I have ever had.  It has mushrooms, peas, and corn which I've never seen in this dish anywhere else.  The only good part of the meal was the spring roll that came with it.  Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!!!
We had chicken pad Thai and it was tasteless and watery. 
We had the mango chicken as well. And same thing, tasteless. 
We came for lunch and there are lots of ads outside the restaurant saying lunch special starting at 5.99, nothing on the lunch menu was 5.99. 
I'll definitely never come back. 
Nice interior decor for an Asian place but what a waste since the food is not worth wasting your time, money and calories over."}
{"text":"Tried this 3 times, all takeout, hoping it would improve as I thought the menu sounded great. Service was fine, takeout orders were delivered reasonably quick.  I love Thai and Japanese food, but this style of fusion doesn't do justice to either cuisine.  The free Hawaii roll was also not to my taste.  Sadly, the fried foods (like Pad Thai) tasted of turned oil or perhaps had another dishes' flavor still in the pan, which I disliked."}
{"text":"Went with family and apparently the foods changed a bit?? I can't honestly say, but here's my experience:

Pad Thai was good. It wasn't too mushy and noodles were soft. There's a nice balance between noodles and extra toppings like the meat and veggies and sprouts. I think the sauce needs a bit work though. The flavours were there, but not strong like Pad Thai should be. I didn't get a clear tangy vs sweet vs salty effect that you expect from Pad Thai. Ended up putting curry sauce to mix in. Curry, by the way, was pretty good. Decent comfort food style.

I'm a bit weary about places that offer Japanese and Thai food.. It's not quite fusion as it's just offering dishes from both cuisines for the most part. 

If you just wanna grab a good bite and filll in a bit of asian food craving, this is a nice spot to hit!"}
{"text":"Odd place.  Most Asian food in Durham is a fusion mix,  don't expect authentic Japanese, Chinese or Thai for that matter.  As an Asian person the bento boxes might be one of the better ones in the city.  but avoid the Chinese food here.  The thai is not that great either.  Where is good Thai food in the city?  I find myself still go to Toronto for that stuff."}
{"text":"I had two meals in the span of a week from Odine - first an incredible Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai that was two meal massive, and that I had sushi for the second meal. Both were quite delicious and good value. The only thing, in fact, they I didn't particularly like from Odine was the Tom Yam Soup. It was just... Something was off with it. But everything else, and the meals of my dining companions in both cases, were great."}
{"text":"We go to Odine on a regular basis and we enjoy the overall experience. Management runs this restaurant with a keen eye and the service is very good.

There are good options for both Japanese and Thai but we love Thai and so we go with more Thai than Japanese. The combo for Chicken Cashew Nut comes with soup, spring roll, mango salad, and some sushi. Really great value and delicious.

The Thai food at Odine is very good and so this is one of the better choices in Ajax. The seafood with XO sauce is yummy."}
{"text":"It's Friday night and my son wanted to order sushi again for the third time this month. I decide to try this place based on the good reviews and I pass it on the way home from work daily. We ordered some maki rolls, noodles and rice.

Dynamite roll: the red roe had a fishy taste and the rice was mushy

Thai noodles: pretty good, had a good amount of spiciness

Pineapple fried rice: meh, I had better 

Other makis: same mushy rice

Overall I was not impressed. Maybe a dine in experience would be different. As for ordering again, it is a no thank you! I would assume that since it's a fusion place it doesn't specialize in sushi rolls per say but I ate at Azian in Oshawa before and it's a similar fusion style and they are excellent.  

Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Good pad Thai ... though not outstanding. Fast services. Small facilities but quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been here a dozen times and always had good food and service at reasonable prices.  Mango salad is excellent as are the various bento boxes. Bottle of white wine is reasonably priced and not 3 times the LCBO cost.  Recommended."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to get together with me for sushi and since I hadn't tried this place, i was curious to see if it could hold a candle to my other wonderful sushi experiences.

It didn't.

We came in at a very quiet time, it was the Sunday of a long weekend and there wasn't much going on. I think this place is known for their fusion cuisine and not so much on their sushi, but much of the menu is sushi and not wanting to be too adventurous, I stuck with what I knew. I ordered some Edamame and Sashimi dinner A, which includes Salmon, Tuna, Tilapia, Butterfish and White Tuna, for a total of 15 pieces. 

Boy was I disappointed! I don't know if the quality of sushi here is lower or if it just wasn't as good but I was really disappointed with my two favourites, the sushi and the butterfish. Butterfish usually melts in my mouth and here, I couldn't be bothered to finish the pieces that were on the plate because the texture was kind of gross. All in, it wasn't a very good plate. The green salad was yum, but that's usually the standard at Japanese restaurants. The miso soup left something to be desired, probably the blandest miso soup I've ever had. 

The thai dish that my friend ordered looked fantastic and the portion was massive. My other friend ordered a bento box, which looked even better, so perhaps I just managed to order the wrong thing from this restaurant. I did try one of the spicy tuna rolls and that was quite good, but it couldn't save dinner for me.

I don't plan on coming back here, I've had family comment to me that they felt the same way about the food, but like I said before, perhaps I just didn't order the right stuff from the menu. I'd avoid this and go down the street to Makimono if I wanted sushi that bad!"}
{"text":"Good place in an area where I would not expect it.  Been racing in Canada for 2 weeks and struggling for good places to eat in Ajax.  Keg was a disappointment, the Burger place in this shopping center the same, but O'Dine was really good, nothing special but good Asian Fusion food from the shrimp tempura to the chicken.  We wanted to modify some orders and it was no problem.  Good quick service as well.  Big surprise in Ajax."}
{"text":"I stopped by for carry-out.  Ordered basil chicken, California roll, and avocado salad.  All of it was excellent and fresh.  Looks like a nice place to dine in, as well. 

I'll definitely come again when I'm in the area!"}
