{"text":"Champagne cocktails +  2-for-1 Monday nights +  Jimmy bartending = WAY TOO MUCH FUN.  Love this place.  My faves are The Skipper N Ginger TOO, the Bellini (of course), and the Fleur de Champagne."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST cocktail bar in Madison. The bartenders take excellent care of you. They have amazing signature drinks and the appetizers are fabulous. You have to check this place out. Once you experience all they have to offer you will be back!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great atmosphere, reasonably priced for a fancy-ish cocktail bar."}
{"text":"Best small lounge for adults in Madison.  Great drinks at adult prices keeps out the riff-raff.  Good small plates you can turn into a light meal.  The place to go for a nice cocktail and conversation."}
{"text":"This place is just alright. I agree that their drinks are quite good- possibly some of the best mixed \"martinis\" (yeah, really just mixed drinks in a martini glass) in Madison. However, small or \"intimate\" = the place is shaped like a shoebox. So, you either sit at the narrow bar and feel you're breathing on top of the drink garnishes, or you sit on low seating near the wall and stare at people's knees. Clientele is okay- not all undergrad college kids spilling cheap beer on you, but then you get some so-so thirtysomethings.  Their regular food menu is pretty okay, and I would like the place a whole lot more if they would serve it until close. I can't drink their drinks all night without eating something and their late-night menu is limited to, I believe, two whole items, both of which require tooth-brushing afterward. So, in short, drinks are quite good, everything else- meh."}
{"text":"Painfully hip.  Furniture designed to tip over when you sit on it.  Drink prices that will make you gasp.  But friendly bartenders who will make you forget that...but they will not, absolutely not, forget your tab.  Don't hate it because its beautiful...have another ($$$) Sapphire martini...you'll feel better..."}
{"text":"Opus Lounge has fantastic drinks and appetizers! The service is excellent, especially with Mandy as she will give you suggestions as you ask for them. A definite must hang out for the night owls in Madison!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed! We arrived around 9pm and couldn't find anywhere to sit or really stand- the layout is a little strange with a really long bar and a row of booth type seats parallel to it, but we managed to make our way to the bar and get a drink menu.  If you have trouble making decisions like I do, beware that the list of cocktails itself is pretty much two full menu pages with a multitude of delicious sounding drinks. When it was my turn to order I panicked and picked the first item on the menu- a vodka based basil and blood orange drink. As we waited for our drinks, I started to read the menu some more and started to get ordering fomo as I saw some other options that also sounded delicious. It took a while for our drinks to come out but I'm going to attribute that to the fact that they seemed to be very swamped with orders. When I got my drink, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the flavors melded together and how basil-y the drink was. They were able to make a great tasting cocktail while being very innovative with their ingredients and combinations. Everyone I was with loved their drink and the ones that I tired were all great. They're a tad on the price-y side for Madison, but given the quality of the drinks I'd say it was worth it. It started to clear out around 10:30ish and we were able to snag a booth which made the experience much more enjoyable (compared to cramming around one end of the bar). I would definitely go back to try some more of their cocktails and either go on the earlier or later side to be able to sit at a booth or table."}
{"text":"adorable, creative, and delicious!!  And the drinks aren't so bad either!  ; )"}
{"text":"This is a nice place and my favorite place in Madison. but the manager Mandy is really rude because she would kick people out for no reason. She's stubborn and non-friendly. I wouldn't come back here ever again unfortunately."}
{"text":"Love it! We come back from out of town this is so good. Great mixed drinks and martinis! Relaxed, more sophisticated crowd. If you like peanut butter, the 'Butter Up Kim' is dreamy. I haven't found it anywhere else."}
{"text":"I should clarify: my review PRE-new management would be 5-Stars. (Great music, great ambience, friendly cool staff,etc.)   POST-Mandy, the new owner-manager, however, I would have to say it has experienced a precipitious decline.   First of all, there has apparently been a purge, and it seems all of the old staff (save a server named Rob, who is nice) are gone. The personality and class of those people was part of the attraction, and why I would pay $9 for a drink.   Now you have Ms. I-Used-To-Manage-a-Chili's (how hip is that?!) behind the bar (s-l-o-w-l-y mixing drinks) and an extremely unfriendly, unsmiling female server who makes one feel like they are bothering her if she needs to take a drink order. You are working in the service industry-- for tips!-- would it kill you to smile? Perhaps nepotism isn't the best way to fill employee slots; apparently she is dating the owner's brother, which is the only way I can she that she's keeping her job.  Next: the music. It *was* a nice mix of cool, soothing background music (think Manu Chau) which was conducive to conversation and the swanky lounge atmosphere it is supposed to be. Now it is too loud, and often just bad. If I wanted to listen to the soundtrack to \"Night at the Roxbury\" I'd go across the street to Madison's. And did my ears deceive me, or did I actually hear them blasting the overplayed Reggaeton song \"Gasolina\"? Ugh.  The drinks: The quality and variety has declined. I've heard a lot of \"we no longer carry that vodka\" or \"we no longer offer that drink flavor\" since the new regime took over. Also, if I'm paying $9, I'd like a little presentation. A perfectly mixed cocktail with a little mermaid reclining against the rim, placed carefully on a clean fresh cocktail napkin was fun. A drink hastily slapped on the table, sans and window-dressing, its contents slopped over the side, with nary a \"thank, you-- enjoy!\" is not appreciated. The little extras count, and their absence is missed.   It also just doesn't seem as clean. Tables are not wiped off promptly, empties are left on the table, and there is crud ground into the carpet.   Finally, last but not least, the crowd had changed. It used to be fun partly because of the very diverse clientele-- Asian/Indian/Latin/Russian/Gay/Straight/Couples/Students/Young Professionals, etc.  I saw the crowd gradually change, and some regulars disappear. Now there seem to be a lot of ill-dressed white townie yokels (friends of the owner?) hanging out by the bar, talking too loudly and drinking beer.   While perusing their web site for signs of the sad new changes I noted that they still had a link to \"candid photos of the staff\", though clicking on it gets \"This website is temporarily unavailable, please try again later.\" Yes, that's because they're all gone...like a lot of loyal customers. I used to be in there almost every week and spent quite a lot of my hard-earned money there too-- I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet however wouldn't order off the cocktail menu unless you want a heavily mixed and sweetened drink. Wouldn't trust them to make a classic cocktail (ie old fashioned or martini)."}
{"text":"Best mixed drinks and a classier, intimate lounge near the Capitol. The bartenders understand what they are doing and are always helpful and friendly. At some point during the night, I usually end up ordering a Martini Flight, which is a great way to sample Opus' signature martinis. They only have a few beers on tap but they're always interesting choices -- Lindeman's Framboise comes to mind. They also serve decent food with a definite Japanese influence (edamame, grilled eel rolls).  I do wish their seating were more comfortable. The little seats around the low tables are extremely light and prone to tipping over. Sure makes it harder to relax and partake in martinis."}
{"text":"I was delighted to be back after almost 10 years and find the Opus Lounge still with its distinct character and great happy hour options and prices. We had a Champagne Bath and a Grasshopper cocktail. It was a Friday early in the evening so it was still not too busy. We plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with a buddy of mine and it was amazing. I even checked-in! I have been searching madison for a nice low-key lounge like this where you can actually have a conversation with whom you are with with out blasting music. Nice comfy couches set a relaxed tone and exotic drinks make ya feel important! Furthermore, the staff who was there that night was a nice female server and male bartender I believe Sara was her name. They knew their drinks extremely well and made excellent suggestions when I couldn't figure out what I wanted. They based their suggestions off other drinks I had enjoyed. 5 Stars for gorgeous location, beautiful interior, and awesome, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Madison.  The drinks are delish - I love the Hypnaughty, and the vodka cocktail in which you choose your own freshly muddled fruit is also divine.  I haven't tried a drink there that I wouldn't order again, but I also stay away from cocktails which include chocolate or dairy products of any kind.  The chips with dip were pretty tasty, though I don't go to Opus to eat.  The best part about Opus, in my opinion, is how chill it is, the fact that it doesn't have a TV stuck to the wall, and how many \"old\" (read: over 23) people there are there."}
{"text":"Great drink selection and awesome tasting drinks. Great service. Awesome ambiance inside and everyone is very social. The place is owned and operated by Mandy and she is an amazing owner with great people skills. Opus won't disappoint if you're looking for a great drink."}
{"text":"Food's pretty decent....i had crab cakes there before and they were good enough : ) the salad's vinegrette had a tad too much vinegar though. frambua by lindemans (rasberry beer) was good : )"}
{"text":"Are you looking for a place to hang out and chat with friends? Look no further, after your delicious meals at the capitol, head over to this sleek and comfortable lounge for some drinks and talk.   Also, they have many happy hour specials. Snacks are 25% off, and on other days they have other specials!  The owner, Many (I'm really sorry if I wrote your name wrongly..), was very kind to let Yelp have its Boozing and Schmoozing event at her lounge. She personally served our group and made sure we had drinks to go around for everyone. According to Many, Opus was the first location for signature/craft cocktails in Madison, in 2000!! isn't that amazing?    I really enjoyed the booths and low lighting. Drinks and good ambience make for great conversations. The snacks seemed rather expensive on the menu, but they were all tasty AND after happy hour discount, we paid only $16 for 5 different appetizers. woohoo. great deal!  Snacks: Sweet potato fries - great thickness, not crispy/crunchy fries. I wish there were more! Great sauce to go with fries. Fried cheese - I imagined a slab of grilled cheese look-a-like. But I got SPRING ROLLS! Awesome idea. love the crispiness from the wrap, and chewy texture of the cheese Hummus - wish there were more hummus! There was loads of olive tapenade and a huge roasted garlic.  Chips and Dips - one of the most worth it items on the menu. lots of chips with nice ranch like dip.  Drinks: Whiskey man - floral, not so sweet drink (although some friends disagree). Quite a strong alcoholic taste Alana's ruby slippers - love this champagne cocktail. sweet and bubbly and fruity. Definitely my next drink when I visit Lady Earl (or something like that from the seasonal specialty cocktails) - not so sweet drink. taste more of the alcohol than anything Latino Pepino (seasonal specialty) - refreshing and light. not a sweet drink.  I won't be here for food, but I'll definitely bring my girls when I want to have some downtime to unwind and chat. Happy hour drinks and snacks are another motivation ;)"}
{"text":"Place is beautiful!!   love the vibe and the atmosphere.  Unique to Madison.     Food is good and it is a good place to chill.  Downside it is a little small.  Love the drinks.   I think the drink prices factoring that they  give you a good atmosphere and location.       Def worth stopping by.     Although avoid when they are busy, because it can get cramped."}
{"text":"Pretty swank appetizer/lounge that seems like it was transplanted from one of the bigger urban centers, such as Miami or Chicago. My friends and I went on a Wednesday at 7 PM and it was empty besides us. Which I didn't mind at all because we were able to have our meeting and didn't care about the lack of scene we saw. I did enjoy the poivre, which I had trouble pronouncing and was embarassed. Essentially, this drink is just a pear flavored glass of champagne. They put this fizzy cube at the bottom and it tasted nice!  I was also a fan of the shrimp and carrots tempura fried in a light, distinct batter, but wish it came with other vegetables besides asparagus. Yay for it not being greasy.   And, I was on heavenly planet hummous when that came with the mildly salted, fluffy pita bread and olive tappenade (not too bitter). The price I paid for these dishes to share? 15 bucks, which included tax and tip. A little more than I would like to spend, but we also had a nice server.   Even the bruschetta my pals ordered looked good. In fact, I was tempted to try some (but didn't), since I normally am not a big fan of the dish at all. But trust me: I did have hope for Opus that it makes an awesome dish to win over even non-fans like me."}
{"text":"Opus is my favorite lounge spot in Madison. 1/2 price wine and app night is golden, and their champagne drinks are A-game. The fondue has been a reason for my friends and I to gather on more than a few occasions too! Espresso is also available if desired. Only critique or suggestion is sometimes I leave smelling lightly of oil from what I presume is lack of ventilation from the kitchen? This has happened on more than a few occasions."}
{"text":"Awesome drink specials and service. I love going on Tuesdays for half priced Martini Flights! Yum."}
{"text":"When I think of Opus, I think of opulent, but in the suburban-moderno sort of way.   This is a decent stand-by place to get together for some conversation and drinks, and they also have hors d'oeuvres or chocolate fondue for those who like nibbling with their sipping. It's in a central location, and there's usually some parking around.  The drinks are a bit pricey to merit staying for longer than a drink or two, but you'll do it if you're in good company. Also, with names like \"Banana Nut Bread,\" and my favorite from a summer menu long past, \"Boot Rear Float,\" it may be hard for the sweet-toothed to resist.    Opus can get crowded for groups of 4 or more during the usual times, but if you come early or are lucky enough to get booth seating, feel free to settle in and order another \"Snowball.\""}
{"text":"Riff raff... hahaha. So true. But seriously... I don't think it's that expensive! Definitely much cheaper than going out in a bigger city. Especially if you go during the week with their drink specials. Or have someone take you there on a date. Besides, you can't beat half-priced bottles of wine on Sunday. Also. Chips and dip are a must.   I feel like nothing bad could ever happen at Opus. Wait. Actually, that's a lie. I was set on fire by a B52 shot gone wrong. lol. In the bartender's defense... he'd never made one before. hahaha. Anyway, long story short- I hearts the Opus and get the warm fuzzies when I think about it =)"}
{"text":"I met the girlfriend here for a tapas dinner and drinks. And frankly, the beer selection was shit and the tapas were shittier.  I'm sure that Opus is good at what it specializes in. The nearly all-female clientele on any given night is an attestation to the fact that if you're at Opus, you're there for the fancy-looking sweet cocktails. The cocktail menu is impressively large and creative, with something for everyone who likes paying $12 a drink.  If you want beer though, they've got about 4 or 5 on tap and an equally unimpressive bottle selection. I applaud them for bringing in a couple unique Belgians but, as you might expect, one was fruit-flavored with a low alcohol content and cost twice as much as a regular beer.  What really bothered me about Opus is the quality of food they're serving. I got a decent spread of tapas and found that I didn't just have a bad dish or two. The crappy food quality is present in everything.  First off, portions are massive. So that's the first strong indicator that you're not being served \"tapas,\" you're being served \"frozen appetizers.\" Tapas are small portions that have been expertly cooked and cared for, with an attention to detail that is not at all present in Opus' food. So it's pretty clear that they write \"tapas\" on their menu for the snooty foreign-sounding effect, and that is just plain deceptive at best.   Going through dish by dish I can tell you that all the Asian-style tapas were absolute garbage. The spring rolls were extremely soggy and contained a bitter mixture of gooey black \"vegetables.\" The tempura was greasy and very unappetizing; I had no desire to finish it at all.   But the worst offender was the cheese fondue which, in addition to being served in a bowl comically heated by a tiny tealight candle, was way too bitter for enjoyment. By the end it was less a fondue moreso than it was a bowl of gross melted cheese and half-and-half. The selection of items for dipping was strange and included several ingredients that I was disgusted by earlier.  All that aside I can end on one good note with the food, which I found in the goat cheese crostini. While the goat cheese itself was not much better than anything you can grab in the grocery store, the tapenade and vinaigrette topping that crostini were excellent redeeming qualities. Both were just a little sweet and a lot savory, imparting a unique and delicious flavor. And that's saying a lot about the tapenade because I tend to dislike olives.   So, again, to summarize. Nice and overpriced cocktails. Almost everything else is absolute shit."}
{"text":"Not my favorite happy hour spot in Madison, but also not my least favorite.  Opus Lounge has daily happy hours from 4:30-7pm where you get 25% off all your drink and food orders.   The inside is dimly lit, with a modern vibe to it. However, being a lounge, I expected more wrap-around couches. Instead, they had some very low tables surrounded by ottomans, which made for some awkward and not-exactly-comfortable seating arrangements.   They have a fair amount of cocktail drinks, all of the very sweet and fruity variety. I tried their Loco Coco Café Margarita (mostly because I wanted to say the name as I ordered) and the Whiskey Man.   Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the drinks, as they were definitely more about the presentation than substance (at least to me).   I have yet to try any of their food here, so I'm still holding on to hopes that it will be good enough for me to add this to my regular happy hour spots."}
{"text":"Friendly service  odd beer selection no spotted cow. Lots of mixed libations and they specialize in martinis. Mid 20s and up crowd"}
{"text":"After reading a few of the Yelp reviews and seeing the menu when I first arrived I was concerned that this would be a menu driven cocktail lounge lacking any real creativity.  Boy, was I wrong, and am I ever glad I was!  The decor is urban chic with a soundtrack to match that ranged from hip hop to acid jazz and many alternative formats in between.  As I scanned the booze behind the bar I saw what I thought were too many flavored vodkas, but then, who doesn't have too many flavored vodkas these days?  The menu was also full of what sound like fruity, girly drinks and, my pet peeve, is called a martini menu (a martini is a cocktail, and this was a cocktail menu!).    Fortunately, Marilyn, the bartender on duty, came to the rescue and patiently demonstrated that she and Opus have real cocktail chops.  I ended up sampling three of the menu items, the Dill Collins, an interesting riff on the classic Tom Collins which was very refreshing on a warm summer evening,  Next was the Royal Highness featuring Plantation rum and egg white among its ingredients.  Yes, I said egg white, and when a bar is mixing cocktails with egg white they get my full attention!  This drink evoked visions of tiki torches and tropical beaches for me.  The third menu item was the Pimm'd Up Bondurant.  Only the second cocktail I've seen anywhere using the venerable Pimm's No. 1 and it was delicious.  I finished the night with an off menu drink from Marilyn that featured Laphroiag scotch, ginger and lemon flavors.  Again, a homerun that has me wishing I had written down the recipe - but unfortunately, didn't.    Bottom line is that if you're looking for good cocktails in Madison, look no further than Opus Lounge."}
{"text":"Love this old standby for the cozy bench seating, just don't like how I smell of the fryer after leaving. Great cocktails, attentive service."}
{"text":"The cocktails are really out of this world, totally deserving of their reputation- try \"Gavin's Braveheart\" or the pumpkin pie special. In the warmer months they have outdoor seating with a view of the Capital, very charming. Worth a trip (or 10!)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday when live on king street was going on and this place was the perfect spot! My friend and I grabbed a seat by the window and could watch the concert while sipping on some martinis. Speaking of Martini's, this place is a lounge and their menu is pretty much liquid. which is great!  We got the martini flight which is more like 4 shots than it is a martini, but they were pretty good. The server didn't really know which ones she was giving, but 1 was chocolate, 1 was coffee, 1 was with cucumber, and the last had an orange peel. That's the best I can do and boy did i feel them after. I wouldn't say this would be a go to place, but it is nice for a classy night out ."}
{"text":"They have a very large extensive drink menu. Service isn't consistent and it can be very busy on weekends. A great date night place or when grabbing a drink before dinner elsewhere. If you're in the mood for a martini check it out!"}
{"text":"We went bar hopping, and Opus was one of our stops. It did not measure up to the other three places within walking distance we went to. We had sushi, not bad. If you want creative cocktails they have many to choose from, but if you want a classic cocktail - beware. I just wanted a good Old Fashioned. The drink in progress appeared bright pink-orange (should look like bourbon) and the bartender asked if I wanted my Old Fashioned sweet or sour? I said 'neither, what do you mean?' With soda gun poised over my drink, she said 'sweet would be with Sprite, sour with sour mix.' Sorry, but neither belongs in an Old Fashioned. The decor seems a little mod 70's too. Fortunately the bars before and after were much better.."}
{"text":"Ambience is cool, dark, romantic which is the only reason for any stars. Went with a group last night and only one of us actually liked the cocktail we chose. I was excited to try a martini flight which is 4 samples of their martinis (bartender's choice), but they were awful. I did not like a single one. I tried some of the other choices from our group, and we came to the conclusion that their cocktails are simply unbalanced and overly fruity and/or flowery. Better off ordering wine or beer at this cocktail lounge."}
{"text":"Ok I absolutely love this place for their dessert martinis! There's quite a few chocolate ones to choose from, along with peanut butter, coconut, and a bunch of fruity ones! I think they also let you do a sampler? Maybe... don't quote me on that one.  It gives off a \"young professionals hang here after work\" kind of vibe but also nice for a small friend group hangout or a date."}
{"text":"Calling all douche bags! This is the place for you. Expansive drink menu (sometimes less is more, people) and a tiny, uninspired food menu. Ordered the charcuterie plate because how can you screw up sliced meats, cheese, and crackers? I guess you can when the crackers are stale, olives are canned, and meat is dry and flavorless. I think it's a pretty good bet that people don't come for the food. The plus: our waitress was super nice, considering she had to deal with DBs and plastered college students."}
{"text":"Butter up Kim. There's really no other drink you even need to try, because this peanut butter martini will change your life.  Also, the chips and dip are delicious. It's like an explosion of sour cream and onion flavor in your mouth. The other food is pretty good, but not memorable.  Seating can be limited, but cozy. The \"booths\" in the back are comfy, with cute cushions. The seating is low to the ground, so it may not be comfortable for those with long limbs.  But once you order a Butter up Kim, you won't notice anything else!"}
{"text":"The quality and variety of drinks is not what you would expect given the location. Good beer list and a great martini."}
{"text":"I have a new found appreciation for Opus now that I've eaten there. I purchased a groupon for Opus for $25 which included two drinks and two plates ($50 value). My boyfriend and I went on a Friday evening around 8 and it was packed! Opus has a great \"lounge\" atmosphere. We ordered the crabcakes and fondue. Both were delicious. So were our drinks. Service was average. I'd definitely come back here to eat and or drink. It's such a unique place in Madison and the drinks list is eclectic! If they offer another Groupon, I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I cant wait to go back! My girlfriends and I did a martini night here and it was really really good. They offer other drinks as well, but their martini's are really special. I got the sampler tray, which is something the bartender mixes up for you. It is 4 signature drinks of the bartender's choosing. A great idea! The place itself is a little small, and can get crowded."}
{"text":"I just keep coming back here. Appetizers are really good and go well with the drinks. Try the Butter Up Kim."}
{"text":"Best martinis in Madison, hands down. Relaxed atmosphere and friendly servers. Refreshing break from all the noisy bars playing bad music."}
{"text":"Opus Lounge practically oozes class.   The dimmed lights, individual cushiony booths,  and tea lights at every table lend an atmosphere of ultimate coziness. This romantic setting combined with their extensive drink menu make Opus the perfect date venue. Not to mention that the lounge is directly across the street from the Majestic Theatre and a few yards away from the capitol building.   Opus' huge array of signature drinks (as creative as they are well-made) is the real selling point for this lounge. You are basically guaranteed to find a drink to anyone's liking.   The food, on the other hand, was less impressive,  in my opinion. The food menu is geared toward small plates for sharing, which in theory fits this lounge perfectly. I felt thst the menu was rather limited and a little bit uninspired.   There were aspects that stood out among the plates we sampled. They offer excellent cheese. Out of the food I tried, I would recommend the crabcakes, which are deliciously crispy, garlicky, and spicy. The sushi and dumplings I found a little bland.   Ultimately, Opus Lounge is great for drinks, and if thry jazz up their menu a little more they have the potential to become a top Madison location."}
{"text":"On the plus side, there is a lot of selection and the staff are friendly and well-meaning.   Otherwise, almost every single drink is incredibly sweet. I struggled to find something that wasn't loaded with sugar, and even drinks that are described as mild or tart sent me into sugar overload. The place is crowded and relatively uncomfortable, especially on the weekend.   It's one of the few bars in madison that seems geared exclusively towards bachelorette parties. Which I guess could be a plus or a negative."}
{"text":"Butter Up Kim and chips and dip. That's all I need. I'm here every week or 2 for happy hour. Love it."}
{"text":"Apparently, I am \"riff raff\", and not an \"adult\", because the prices at the Opus Lounge are exactly what keeps me from going to it.  I find it totally ridiculous that for the same price as a \"chocotini\", I could go buy a BOTTLE of vodka and some Hershey's syrup, because that's exactly what the crap tasted like.    I guess I don't really care to hang out at the type of place where people are supposed to get an self-esteem boost because they paid a lot of money for their drink."}
{"text":"Opus is where classy and casual meet for a drink and a bite to eat.  Cocktails are the star of the show here, and I've really enjoyed the ones I've tasted    Personally, I'm a pretty serious craft beer nerd, and I'm quite pleased with Opus's relatively short but very well-curated tap list.  They pour a nice mix of brews from Madison and beyond, with solid representatives of the major genres plus some interesting entries.  While it's not an expansive list, it's very well thought out and sure to satisfy.    I've sampled several appetizers including sushi rolls, sweet potato fries, chips, and the addictive sweet/salty/spicy nuts and enjoyed them all.  Service is absolutely top notch.  At a large event tonight, our charming server , Jessica, not only kept a drink in every hand but knew exactly who ordered what and needed no sorting out of drinks among our large group at the end of the evening which was very impressive!    This little spot has a wide range - I'd come here with a big group like tonight, a quick solo or small group drink after work, and anything in between."}
{"text":"I really like Opus. I feel like it's one of the few bars downtown that has a happening scene without being a rowdy college scene on a Saturday night.  It's classy and intimate, and the drinks are delicious.  They're more pricey than I'd like, but the prices are reasonable for martinis.  Their martini concoctions are extensive.  I really enjoy their champagne martinis and the tokyo rose with sake and plum wine.     The food is okay. It's not fine dining, but more upscale than your average bar food.  But really, I'm there for the martinis not the food."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't reviewed Opus yet--I go there probably every couple of weeks.  As a grad student, I basically limit myself to their Monday all-night happy hours, but if I were in a higher income bracket, I'd definitely go more often.  Yes, they're pricey.  But they're worth it.  I love their cocktails, both the fancy froufrou ones (for example: the Butter Up Kim--sounds horrible; peanuts in a drink?! but it is DELICIOUS; the Ryan's Baby--lemony delicious; the Cha Cha Cha, which matches my hair) and the very simple wines (which they have always obligingly let us sample before ordering) and my personal favorite: gin rickeys made with fresh-squeeze lime juice.  I especially appreciate the attentive service that we have always received.  I generally go with other grad student types, and some places I get the feeling that staff don't feel we're worth their time, but that NEVER happens here.  The owner recognizes me--admittedly not hard with my hair--and she and the staff always take good care of us without being suffocating.  Last time I went, she had a headband I'd dropped there almost a month previously that they'd been hanging onto behind the bar for the next time I came in!  I really enjoy the atmosphere.  I always like the music they're playing (once they played through the entire Massive Attack Mezzanine album; last time, it was something I didn't recognize but pleasantly reminiscent of mid-career David Bowie), and the seating is nice although I try to avoid the little stools at the low tables, preferring the benches.  Finally, if you are looking for a good deal, you can't beat a 25% off \"martini flight\" during happy hour.  Just ask before you order and they'll tell you what exactly you'll be getting.  It's a good way to sample new drinks and a LOT of alcohol for $12 regular price, $9 at happy hour!  Friend them on Facebook for additional special offers--last week they were doing a free drink after 8pm for fans."}
{"text":"I wish I found this place sooner. By far the best place for high end crafted cocktails in Madison. Great vibe and creative drink menu. Adults only if you know what I mean. The ladies flock to this comfortable space."}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming to Opus Lounge. The drink menu has a ton of options and the atmosphere is quieter and more intimate than most bars in Madison. I haven't tried much of the food, but the edamame and chips and dip were both pretty mediocre. I think it's better as an after-dinner drinks place."}
{"text":"I found the best combination of drinks and appetizers at Opus tonight. If you are going with one of the champagne cocktails, the raspberry truffle is definitely the best. I had tried several but this stood out the most. It tasted like dessert without the calories. Did I mention they even served it with a pokey stick? As for the appetizers I found the French onion dip and chips to be my favorite because it had the perfect amount of garlic flavor. Without a doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I have not tried the food, but I love love love the martini flight. Their selection of martinis and other cocktails is unmatched in Madison and suits a variety of tastes."}
{"text":"amazing atmosphere.  Ritsy Indie feel.  I love the lighting.  It's an intimate setting, great for a smaller party.  Very relaxing, great for a weekday drink."}
{"text":"Drinks are solid but the space needs a serious upgrade.  It screams the 1990s and it's not because they are trying to be ironic."}
{"text":"When i was an undergrad here in Madison years ago, this place was so good but now it's just not very that good. I'm from Osaka and the one thing that you DO NOT DO is warm up sake in a microwave. Do you know what the microwave does to water when heat in a microwave? Go home and try that out and heat up that water for about 3 minutes and tell me how does it taste. Well that is how my Otokoyama sake tasted. Flat and not good. Visit there with my Brazilian friend Jessica and she wasn't very please with the drinks but did like the food that was serve to us. I wanted to show her Madison because this was her first time here and i pay for her ticket to come visit me here while I'm still doing my photography workshops and business here because heading back home to Osaka. To Opus, buy a Electric Sake Warmer and stop warming up sake in a microwave. Now if you looking for cocktails and nice drink, yes this is the place and sitting has always been nice. Good to take your other half there and have a good time but some items are a bit over price because there is a few places in the area that serve the same drinks at a lower cost. Makes you wonder now doesn't it? Oh, I am no cheapskate by any means. If you take a good look at where I eat and drink then you will know I am not that type of person. I'd happen to pay attention to detail where I'd visit. As the Panda Photographer that travels a lot and eats good and have a family back in Osaka with restaurant businesses, I'm very much a foodie and sake experience. Just like when a restaurant tells you that they serve KOBE beef, it's a lie because only 9 restaurants in The United State are certified and licence to serve KOBE beef. But in my optional the shrimp had too much pepper and salt but no butter and was a bit overcooked. It was pretty presentation when we got the dish but taste is another thing they have to work on."}
{"text":"Sure is different from the average Midwest Dude hangouts populating the isthmus, which can be a big plus or big minus, depending on your Midwest Dudeness. The fantastic mix drinks are reminiscent of the Barber's Closet of yore, and the music and art are more original than one usually finds in our local watering holes. Sure, the conversations one overhears can be a little laced with pretension and the service can occasionally be lackluster (I trust only the lady with martini tattoos) but when I have the cash I prefer going there for half-price drinks during happy hour over the stentorian-laden alternatives."}
{"text":"Opus is one of those venues that is perfect for so many situations from sexy date night to small group gatherings. There's a bar, small tables in the front, and large format booths that work for a large group or can be shared by two smaller parties.   Their drink menu is extensive and I've never had a drink I didn't like. My go-to is the Water for Chocolate, a chocolate-orange martini. I recently fell in love with a creamy raspberry off-menu special. I wish I could remember what was in it so I could request it in the future!  On a recent visit I tried both the cheese and chocolate fondues and they were quite tasty. Be sure to check out their all-night happy hour on Tuesdays - 25% most of their drink menu and food!  The price point of Opus is a little higher, but you definitely get what you pay for. These drinks are meant to be sipped and savored and it's worth it for a fancy night out that won't completely break the bank."}
{"text":"Excellent Martinis and food. Best service in downtown Madison. Great Appetizers. Nice relaxing environment"}
{"text":"An oft passed-over place near other raucous bars like the Tipsy Cow and Argus. It's so small and classy, no wonder people here walk straight past it. Inside, you will find a lofty space with comfy, intimate booths. There's some classy music playing, and a long list of delicious adult beverages with apt descriptions. They have straight ballin' happy hour specials every day of the week except Saturday, and delicious snacks if you get munchies.   Some of my favorite drinks: Alana's Ruby Slipper (a drink that includes champagne, St. Germaine, cassis, and ginger) and the Whiskey Man (Rye whiskey with orange blossom, hint of elderflower and fresh sour).   Although the space is kind of small, you will probably have it to yourself most of the times. This place is sadly overlooked in favor of the other places on King St. Give it a try though, you will be most pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Friends brought us here, extolling the delights of the martinis. They weren't wrong.  The drinks are interesting, tasting exactly like their namesakes. My root beer float martini tasted JUST LIKE a root beer float: root beer, melty ice cream, fizziness. I was delighted. I ordered the flight, which consists of 4 tiny martinis that are bartender's choice. All of them were great, leaving me sugared up and slightly buzzing. My companions were all equally happy with their orders. We got the cheese fondue in addition, which was quite good. The stuff-to-dip was ok, but I would have liked bigger pieces or a wider array of stuff.   Staff was friendly enough, though not overly welcoming. The decor was comfortable but didn't leave much of an impression on me. It would be fun to go later in the evening when the lighting is low and a small crowd warms the place. I'd definitely go back when in town again."}
{"text":"Really cool place.....clasy and elegant.   The martinis were awesome....I tried the sake martini with ginger candy...loved it. We did not eat there so can't say anything about that.   The service was actually very good...the waiter was very attentive and polite...but then it was a Tuesday nite!....  The mini couches/booths are very comfy....but i think it's a pretty tiny place so nice spots wud be hard 2 come by on weekends, me thinks!"}
{"text":"In the sea of many loud, read: potentially obnoxious, college bars just blocks away, Opus Lounge is a welcome respite. If you seek a true cocktail lounge, this is the place to grab a seat.   The good:  -Opus has a magnanimous list of cocktails - an impressive array that will quench just about anyone's alcoholic thirst.  -The interior (save the green neon lighting) is simple but modern, dark and intimate.  -Servers are friendly a knowledgeable about their extensive menu.  -My husband's drink - Dill Collins - was fantastic. I don't ever, ever, order gin and I would most certainly order this next time around.   The meh: -Drinks can take a very long time to arrive at your table. When hubs and I stopped in for a drink around 6:45pm on a Friday night, we waited 25 minutes for our 2-drink order to arrive. I was thirsty.  -My dirty martini was fine. Not great. Not bad. Just fine. And $10 for a dirty martini in Madison, I expected a bit more.  -I get the allure of an intimate lounge, but I was practically in the lap of the stranger next to me. Seating is tight!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to have a drink in Madison!! Continuously great service!! I love ordering the bartenders choice martini flight. So FUN, Delicious and lots of variety!"}
{"text":"While I've only been a handful of times, that will change. The cocktail menu is exquisite. During last night's visit my guy favorited the mojito while I excitedly sipped the Nick's Bump (chocolate espresso martini), and we both enjoyed the Arandano. The drinks were all blended to perfection and absolutely delicious. Next visit I'll aim to try some of the dining options as they appeared just as flavorful.  At 9:30pm on a Saturday we had no problem coming in and sitting at one of the low tables along the couch wall. I find them cozy and intimate pending the table next to you isn't three woman loudly discussing childrearing and pregnancy. (Maybe go elsewhere if this might be your group.) The ambiance is otherwise perfect for a quieter, more romantic setting for all types of couples.  Service was attentive and polite with happily-given recommendations. Our server was kind and professional.  I look forward to returning soon, especially for another Nick's Bump."}
{"text":"The Opus Lounge is a great break from the loud bars around it. This is a comfortable place to grab a delectable cocktail and some food. We were in last week and got smoked out by something on fire in the kitchen. Kind of a bummer when you are hanging out having a cocktail with friends and something is burning nearby. We weren't sure if we need to vacate our seats and head out the door or if it was a minor incident. Our server didn't seemed to fazed by it, so we just ordered up to another round of martinis. The smoke was soon forgotten. My friend was joking that they were just adding smoke to their ambience! The lemon martini was really good and warrants a try. Cinnamon on the rim of the glass. Yum! They have a cocktail with gin and chartreuse in it. I can't remember the name, but it is also delish! Taste so good that they go down like kool aid. This could be good or bad, you choose."}
{"text":"I consider myself a booze aficionado.  I can safely say that Opus's drinks are both creative and delightful.  The raspberry beer is lighter than the berry weiss that you can buy in the store. It is true the prices are a little bit up there, but if you can make it to happy hour a majority of their drinks are half priced. (HINT: Please read the menu! Some drinks are never on happy hour special, and please don't embarrass yourself by arguing because you cannot read.)  At times Opus does reek of pretension, when this happens: take a couple of sips of your perfectly crafted drink, eavesdrop, then take a deep breath, when you exhale you should feel a smug sense of superiority that you are only that pretentious in your head and not out loud or something. I found the seating comfortable-- true it is a little unconventional. The atmosphere is a little romantic and you are able to have a conversation with your friends without yelling. The only reason why I am not donning this establishment with 5 stars is because of the pretentious yuppie and hipster problem and the servers seem to impose gratuity tables of 5 or more... and I find being gratuitied insulting. (since I'm a fabulous tipper, but not when I am being forced to tip.. eff that)  I haven't sampled their food-- mostly because their menu is a little over priced for what is on it and if I must pay for the atmosphere at Opus, I would rather buy a drink. In sum, unless you're severely allergic to art students, hipsters, or yuppies, go here for wonderfully well-thought out drinks and adept service."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a lovely June evening and had mojitos. They were perfectly prepared by a very pleasant server. I wish we had another night to go back and try a champagne cocktail. The menu of different drinks was enormous so we hope to get back to Madison and try some. Inside looks clean but smelled a little humid. I'm sure when it's full of folks on a weekend night that it's a fun place. We would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Uhm, holy cocktails batman. I mean pages PAGES of cocktails. That alone makes this place rank high in my book!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for their happy hour specials. If you get here before 5:30 or 6pm on a Friday or come on a random Tuesday, you will have no problem finding a place to sit. Both times I've come here have been with groups of ~10 people, and we were able to get seating with no issues (in fact, the place was totally empty when we got here both times).   The drinks are great, and the specials are awesome! They have daily happy hour specials (ex $6 for a flight of 4 2oz martinis on Tuesday evenings) and 25% off all appetizers, wine and taps every day for happy hour. I really liked the martini flight, as it was a fun way to try a few items on their menu without getting wasted. Unfortunately if you love beer you will be disappointed, as they only have 4 beers on tap.   I've only tried three of the appetizers: the sweet potato fries, chips and dip and the hummus and pita plate. The chips and dip were disappointing, but the rest of the appetizers were yummy. The sweet potato fries had some nice spices and heat to them, which we appreciated.  The service is ok, and the seating is a little odd. The people who work here aren't very attentive or accommodating, which to me was surprising given we were the only group at Opus for a while both times we visited. The chairs and tables are not very comfortable. All the tables are very low, so if you have normal length legs you likely will not be able to fit them under the table without hurting your knees.   This is a fun place to come to enjoy some good drinks, but make sure you come during happy hour (drinks are pretty pricey otherwise) and with people who like cocktails!"}
{"text":"A great date spot. Romantic lighting and seating, great cocktails and not a hint of pretense despite the oh-so-cleverly named cocktails."}
{"text":"There's two full pages of bespoke signature and specialty cocktails--trust me, there's something for everyone. Our table stopped by for their Thursday happy hour (15% off drinks and small bites) and thoroughly enjoyed Will's Mojo (traditional mojito), Dark and Stormy (complete with a cocktail umbrella that had gone \"through a storm,\" Banana Bread (Rum Chata and dark rum), and Jim Jam Hendrix (Hendricks gin, lavender, blackberry).  Opus has a small, intimate indoor lounge with booths ideal for a party of four as well as a handful of sidewalk tables to people watch. Definitely come for the crafted cocktails even if you're just pre-gaming for a night out or needing a night cap."}
{"text":"Have been a number of times for a pre-dinner cocktail.  The drinks here are great and they have a wonderful selection of spirits.  The food is just okay.  Boiled potatoes with the cheese fondue, in addition to bread cubes??? WTF...."}
{"text":"This lounge is a classy, intimate bar with amazing drinks. My boyfriend and I each got one drink and thoroughly enjoyed them - he especially enjoyed the bleu cheese stuffed olives. It wasn't too busy so we were served fairly quickly and had an attentive waitress. Prices were a bit high but the drinks were high quality. I am definitely looking forward to going back here!"}
{"text":"It's easy to forget this quiet and unassuming location.  It is a warm, inviting space for a romantic evening or to have a conversation with friends.  There are lots of nooks to feel like you have the place to yourself.  The drink menu is impressive.  Probably one of the best places to get a real cocktail.  Wine list is nice, too.  There are tapas and other bites to eat.  I need to make this a more frequent stop, for sure!"}
{"text":"NOTE: For whatever reason, Yelp has deleted my deleted my negative review (as well as others') at least twice! What's up with that, Yelp? My opinion is just as valide as anyone else's!!! I'll repost as often as I need to get the word out.  Once a Madison nightlife gem, Opus seems to have lost its soul and has degenerated into one part unwelcoming private bar, one part overflow of the louder, more obnoxious bars in the area. How could a place that seemed almost too refined for a college town lose so much of its shine, you ask?  Four words: New Ownership, Poor Management.  From the minds that brought you Madison's Chili's restaurant experience (East *and* West), the new owners/bar-tenders have managed to retain the Opus namesake but little else.   Once one of the few mainstream nightspots that had an exotic, out-of-the-norm, queer-friendly atmosphere, the Opus experience was as much about the friendly, quirky, but always classy wait staff as it was about the drink and food menu. Attentive but never bothersome, the waiters/bartenders would not hesitate to offer samples of new martinis, offer shots with the staff if one happened to sit at the bar, and genuinely entertaining conversation and banter. They took pride in the presentation of the (sometimes off-the-menu and custom-made) drinks they served and took aims to make sure their customers enjoyed themselves.  When an establishment asks its customers to pay between $7 and $12 per drink, customers are paying for more than alcohol. In its better days, Opus offered a relaxed, upscale, romantic and intimate spot ideal for both dates and smaller gatherings of friends. The music was a swanky eclectic mix and played at just the right volume for conversation. Even when it was full (as it often was on the weekends), the place retained its lounge atmosphere, and patrons respected this image by dressing-up/dressing well (though the unwashed hipster look was also welcomed).  That is what Opus was before the new ownership. After taking over, one of the owners installed herself as bartender and let go of the other bartenders and wait staff in rapid succession, paring down the staff to just two servers, one of whom works with a perpetual scowl and seems bothered to take one's order.  The quality of the martinis has declined noticeably in terms of taste and even more so in terms of presentation and variety. The owner has reduced the number of specialty martinis, exotic liqueurs, and off-the-menu options. The music has changed to something more befitting of a dance floor, often too loud to hear your date or friends speak. Monday nights are now \"game nights\"-- patrons can now play Monopoly and checkers in a dimly-lit martini bar. The owner's new target audience is essentially the overflow from the loud, frat-boy friendly Madison's across the street. The new Opus business strategy is quantity over quality, in line with their previous fast-food restaurateur work experience.  When it's not packed with loud crowds complaining about the martini prices, the owner invites her friends to the bar and devotes all her attention to serving them for free. While this in itself is not necessarily a bother to the average patron, it just so happens that some of her friends happen to be obnoxiously rude and act as if they are at their friend's basement bar, and you're intruding. I have witnessed them on several occasions leering at and bothering other patrons, causing trouble with patrons minding their own, and threatening them with physical violence. At one point there was a physical altercation between the owner's friends and two seemingly self-contained patrons; in the end, the owner sided with her friends and the bar quickly emptied, though it was apparent that even the wait staff thought poorly of the owner and her friends. One's only option is to pay the tab, leave, and spend money elsewhere.  When a bar changes hands, it's expected that the new owners will bring their own ideas and methods to the establishment. However, it was clear to anyone who had frequented the bar in the past that Opus had its unique place on King St, an unpretentious but sophisticated upscale lounge, where one could easily spend a hundred dollars and feel like they got their money's worth. I was a patron of the bar for a few years before and about six months after the ownership change, and though I wasn't particularly close to the previous owners and staff, I did feel that a lot had changed, and for the worse. I posted my thoughts on Craig's List and found that many others had a similar impression.  To recap, there is a marked loss of the intimate, refined feel of the place, the owner's friends are present and obnoxious enough to be considered a noteworthy nuisance, the warmth of the staff is noticeably lacking, and the atmosphere has changed considerably.  For whatever reason, my review, as well as as those from a few others, have been removed. We will repost as often as we need to!"}
{"text":"Nice cocktail bar downtown with a great little food menu.  It has a very chill ambiance. I usually go after 10pm on weeknights and after 11pm on weekends, and it isn't overly crowded.  Try the chocolate fondue because it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"They have so many cocktails to choose! And each of them are really really good, which makes me come back again and again, wagering to finish the whole cocktail list. To mention a few, tiramisu (cocktail) is literally what it tastes like and very special, the grasshopper is refreshing, the lychee is sweet, and the champagne selection is also good. I usually go with the tempura plate to share with friends.  Opus is definitely the best lounge bar in Madison!"}
{"text":"Very cool, swanky spot!  I had the lychee margarita and shared the stuffed olives, spring rolls, and cheese fondue with two pals - it was all pretty good! Definitely enough to fill us up. Good variety on the menu, and the cocktail list looked really fun. We got there around 7 on a game day and didn't have any trouble getting a seat, but it looked like it becomes a pretty hoppin' spot after dark. Dim lighting and low seating, very cool ambience.  Reasonable prices and GREAT service."}
{"text":"Best martinis in Madison.  Tasty drinks (beer choices for those more inclined) -try the Butter Up Kim for a martini.   Good service.  The place is often packed on weekends so seating is not always easy to come by.   There were some trivial pursuit cards at the bar that can be used to show your friends who knows best."}
{"text":"BY FAR my fave lounge/drinks place.  It's small, it's intimate, it's NECESSARY (Especially with the plethora of Great Dane type wings and chips and beer places... don't get me wrong, I like a good pale ale as much as the next person.. but I digress)  The drinks are FANTASTIC.  Please try the pulp fiction, it's by far my fave.  Their appetizers are THAT.  Appetizers.  I wouldn't go there to eat, I go there to drink, enjoy the company of a few friends, and  generally have a great time.  Thursdays there's live music, usually a guitar player, which always sweetens the night..  I'm SERIOUS on the Pulp Fiction.... You WON'T regret it.  The price range is higher, because frankly, at the end of the day, YOU WILL have at least 5-6 cocktails.. And enjoy them...   Be prepared!! :)"}
{"text":"Had a very cool dinner here. Not the most refined food but very enjoyable. Great atmosphere, great waitress."}
{"text":"Great drinks and service. Nice atmosphere with low lighting and a relaxed vibe. The cocktails I've had have been very good, but I'd love to see more options that aren't sweet or fruity. I had the Dill Collins (gin with muddled cucumbers and dill) and it was delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails and friendly, efficient staff!  Those are the highlights of one of the classier places you'll find in Madison. Despite it feeling upscale and classy, it still has a very relaxed, chill atmosphere. I enjoy grabbing one of the lounge areas or sitting up front and watching people pass by on King St.  Ultimately, this is the perfect place to go for some great drinks after work or when starting out an evening in downtown Madison. This is always our first stop before heading to the noise and chaos of other places like Madison's."}
{"text":"cool and chic decor; a place aiming to appeal to the higher-end clientele (i.e. not dead broke college kids).  liked the furniture setting; it's very lounge-y. however, the cushion seats were all over the place they were blocking the narrow passage between tables and they got very chaotic, especially when there were all laying around in no man's land, nobody knew whether we should just grab them or wait for the waiters to properly rearranged them.  got a bottle of asti to go w/the choco fondue; all recommendations from the temp locals (international college students).  wine was good and the fresh fruit plate that came w/the fondue was of a good selection and quality, if a bit scarce.  the chocolate itself was sooooo smooth yet rich, i had to ask what kind it was.  the waiter, who couldn't answer my question, promised to go to the kitchen and ask.  it took him a while so i was not expecting to get much back.  but he REALLY went to ask for me; even wrote down the kind of chocolate on a post-it note to show me.  while i was quite surprised that they would actually share their secret ingredient, i applaud this young waiter for his professionalism on his job.  forgot how much the bill came to for the 4 of us; it did seem a bit pricey given the little that we had. but it was a good place to lounge around, if one got nothing better to do on a weekend--and if you're not the college kid looking for cheap beer and loud club music.  that place was pretty loud itself, but with lounge music instead."}
{"text":"The absolute best cocktails you will ever have. Try the peanut butter!"}
{"text":"How much are you willing to spend in order to not drink with frat boys?  That's a question you have to ask yourself when going to the Opus Lounge.  You do get pretty tasty drinks (make a mean manhattan) and as far as dates go, it's tough to beat.  But this is not your casual Friday night out with your buds type of joint."}
{"text":"The drinks are a little more expensive than most places in Madison but a whole lot better than most! They have the best monitor in Madison in my opinion but I have not gotten a mojito at the usual craft drink places like Merchant's. I don't feel they are on par with the creativity as Merchant's but they can make a mean drink. It sounds like a weird drink but my husband really enjoyed the Scotch version of the blind Russian. Unique but very good flavor! This is a great place to grab a drink or two before a long wait for seating at Red Sushi. If you are a fan of mojitos check them out!"}
