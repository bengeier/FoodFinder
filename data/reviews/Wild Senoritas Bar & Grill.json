{"text":"We arrived for dinner about 40 minutes prior to our son's college soccer game. We ordered fajitas, not really thinking how much work it takes to prepare them. We ended up having to take it to go. The service was excellent as they gathered containers, tableware, and napkins for us, and quickly cashed us out. 
We ate at the game, food was very tasty. Will try this place again with more time to stay and enjoy. Note, the portion was large enough for two people and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Stopped in on their opening night  Very friendly staff.  Completely remodeled and updated with an inviting atmosphere and lots of TVs.  Philly quesadillas were great!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place up until recently. The margaritas were amazing, the food was good, and the environment was awesome...until I went a couple of days ago. The margarita's are now in a glass 1/2 the size of the old ones, and they were disgusting. I'm pretty sure it was just mixing syrup, ice, and a little tequila. The food was also burnt and not good at all. I'm not sure what happened in the last couple of weeks, but it was upsetting."}
