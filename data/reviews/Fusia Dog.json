{"text":"No thank you.   Big hot dog fan, and am truly not that picky when it comes to options. My top choice to this day is still a good ol'fashion Costco option.   My husband and I had popped by Fusia Dog after patiently waiting for it to open! Then - we noticed the weekend hours to be quite unpredictable (it always seemed closed)!    When we finally managed to pass by when it was open, we were truly disappointed.  We tried the Boston, Toronto and their speciality salad.   The Boston and Toronto were both cold. Like, really cold (the cheese didn't even melt). This was followed by soggy salad and mediocre service. The place was cramped and not overly pleasant to eat in at.  My coke zero was cold (and refreshing), but otherwise, have no real reason to come back.   As an aside, something \"didn't quite sit well\" with my husband after we had eaten here - and to this day, still mutters angrily each time we pass by."}
{"text":"Had the fusia dog. It was wrapped in a paratha that, be warned will not hold well, but is delicious. The toppings of kimchi, daikon and carrot salad and wasabi mayo was an amazing combination of flavours to compliment the hotdog. the owner of fusia dog graciously gave us their coleslaw to taste which was a unique spin with the toasted pumpkin seeds. The must have snacks were the potato chips that they make and package themselves. Thicker than average but not as hard to bite as miss. vickies. these chips were awesome and don't saturate your tongue with salt. with all the crappy choices in street food, this is a great start to revolutionizing the hot dog stand."}
{"text":"I went to Fusia Dog for lunch with my buddy who is into trying new food joints and while I am normally fairly skeptical about these types of places, I left Fusia Dog thinking that the food was good.    Let's be clear - this is not a place where you go to get full on $10 and get good bang for your buck.  Even though the lowest priced dog is $7 c'mon now - do you really expect to be blown away by a $7 hot dog?  If you want a cheap hot dog or if you are going to complain how it is not like a street meat hot dog, then this is not the place for you.    People should expect a well-prepared gourmet hotdog that tastes good - not some sort of culinary experience that will transport you to some Asian hot dog paradise.    I had the Fusia Dog.  It comes in a banana-leaf boat on red checked paper. Instead of a bun, it's wrapped in a sturdy griddled Indian flatbread barely able to contain the toppings.  Warning: you will need napkins and a good hand-wash after eating this one!!  There's a mild cabbage kimchi, grated daikon and carrot dressed with rice wine vinegar, cilantro, cucumber, plus some wasabi mayo.    My friend had the Peking Duck Quesadilla, which is slivered duck & skin, scallions, carrots, bean sprouts, and hoisin sauce, grilled in a flour tortilla.  I liked Fusia's take on the quesadilla.   There is minimal seating space in the store.  This is more of a take-out space and when permitting, Dinah (owner) can offer you a TV tray if you decide to take a seat on the bench.  There are 2 seats at the bar too.  The store owner is very curteous and welcoming, and offers samples of salads while you wait.    Fusia Dog was A-OK for me, not necessarily a place I would visit regularly but they do a good job of putting their spin on common food."}
{"text":"Delicious! I have had the Fusia Dog which is an all beef dog on a naan style bread with wasabi mayo and kimchi on top. I also love their Powerslaw salad which is a  cabbage salad with pumpkin seeds and cheddar cheese. They often give out free samples of their soups (lemon grass chicken vegetable, mmmm) and salads and have some free homemade potato chips at the cash counter for sampling. Very affordable. Only a few stools for seating so most people grab takeout."}
{"text":"Really small... Tiny tiny place that fit 6 people. I had a fushia dog... A pratha wrap all-beef hot dog with Kim chi topping for $6.95. It's delicious but I'm unsure whether its worth the price."}
{"text":"don't be cheap and whiny :) This place is great! It will definitely cost you about 7-8 bucks! But come it's in prime location and its much much better than most of the over priced hack restaurants in the area.  The hotdogs are great, good quality, tasty, interesting toppings and the place has an over all fun vibe! Salad is delicious too (who knew!)."}
{"text":"overpriced for what is really a substandard hotdog. Bread wasn't good either and was not shaped or sized proportional to the meat. So the bulk of the price really goes to the toppings ($5 for a tiny portion of cheffed up coleslaw).. reminds me of japadog in vancouver but at least that had a significantly bigger hotdog. This one was the type you get 10 for $2. Really disappointing. Something is seriously off with the pricing."}
{"text":"tried the dog with pork belly (a.k.a. crisped bacon fat). Well prepared but the dog itself was salty, skinny and not very juicy.  They need a plumper dog with more snap in the casing."}
{"text":"Different and tasty, worth checking out, but not a knockout.  Hot dogs, like most substrates, are misunderstood. The core ingredients of a hot dog (bun, pink slime) can be good or not-so-good, and there's certainly art in getting each piece right, but too much of that is distraction. The real test of a wiener is what you do with it.  Fusia dog does, it must be said, some interesting things. Their eponymous offering uses flatbread (paratha) instead of a bun, and dollops some wasabi mayo and kimchi business on top. The chop suey dog's got a heavy sprinkling of hickory sticks, and some lovely grilled onions. The Boston's got a great 3-bean baked bean mix going on. There are, herein, the makings of some good nom.  But the prices ($7-$9) are high for hot dogs and their attempts to justify those prices with generous loads of toppings just make things messy and harder to eat.  You should try it, and you should order the Fusia dog itself since I think it's their strongest play. I did, and I was happy. But I'm unlikely to add it to the regular rotation.  Pro-tip: tasty stuff in the soda case, and also check out their in-house thick-cut chips."}
{"text":"Well, I wasn't expecting much from this place and I was right to. I had the 'FusiaDog', basically a cheap hot dog straight out of the Maple Leaf package with some \"kimchi\" (just some shredded cabbage and carrots, hardly kimchi by any standard) on top. The whole experience cost over 7 bucks. Total rip off. Save your money and go to a hot dog vendor on the street, at least you can get a sausage for under 4 bucks.  I don't see this place lasting long. I would of paid at best 3 bucks for the FusiaDog. I could see this whole idea working if it was just a street cart and meals went for under 5 bucks but to expect people to pay north of 7 dollars for a cheap, crappy hot dog is nuts. I understand that the area is high rent, but this place is going to offer a hell of a lot more if they want to stay afloat.  In short, go to any number of the street vendors in the area if you want a hot dog."}
{"text":"Do you suffer from mild allergies that keep you stuffed up? Maybe you have a head cold and are looking for relief? I have a cure for you. Behold the Fusia Dog. The amount of wasabi mayo they slather onto this tube-o-meat is sure to clear any sinus infarction.   These guys are a perfect example of a business that would highly benefit form a reform in the city's food vendor laws. Their location is super small. Not really large enough to have seating, but they squish in a few stools. They would be perfectly suited to a food truck. It's a small menu of 8 or so different dogs, home made chips, and some salads. While I wouldn't say they have a bad location, I'm guessing that a big part of the reason it costs almost $10 for a Fusia Dog and a pop is the overhead of renting their small space in the Entertainment district.  I really want to be a regular here. Their food is great but unfortunately the price will not keep me coming back often enough.  April challenge 20/30"}
{"text":"I LOVED the Fusia Dog! I had read reviews and it sounded intriguing. I\"m a big street meat person so wondered how they could make it even better.   They did it by putting together an amazing mix of toppings. My mouth felt like a taste explosion had hit it. So delicious!!    You can tell that Dinah Koo's many decades of putting together amazing food combinations was at work here.   Had a taster of their power slaw and it's so different from a standard cole slaw that it's a not a fair comparison.   I'll be back to try another dog real soon!"}
{"text":"When I used to work at Yonge & Bloor, Dinah's Cupboard was one of my favourite shops to peruse and get lost in the details of canned apricots or gourmet chocolate. A few weeks ago when I sauntered up Duncan looking for cheap shawarma, I found instead a tacky sign that read 'Fusia Dog' with Dinah Koo's face in the window, almost beckoning you to try whatever frankenfood awaited.  Inside, the restaurant was disorganized in a way that hinted at the shop's newness. The grill/kitchen, counter, and sitting area all blend into one space. A family of 5 and a couple had already taken up the window counter and lone table space, so I sat down on a bench while Dinah looked for a TV tray to place my impending fusia dog.   I've had my go of Vancouver's japadogs and feel rather impassioned about their existence, so I knew I was coming in biased. If one would compare, I would say that fusia dog just doesn't have that edge. The namesake fusia dog basically tasted like a bahn mi, where instead of tasty meat there was a thin frankfurter that reminded me of New York City's sorry excuse for a hot dog, and instead of a thick chewy bun you had the paratha, which is an Indian flatbread that complimented the flavours quite well, surprisingly. I liked the kimchi plus wasabi mayo combo, but there's nothing new there. They were also giving away homemade crisps (proper thick salty british styled ones) and a sample of the power slaw, which tasted great. In fact, I think it might have been my favourite part of the meal.   Not to be discouraged, I also ordered a Peking Duck Quesadilla to go, hoping to steal a bite while my friend tells me if it's innovative. Unfortunately she was even harsher and said that we could have put everything together in 5 minutes with some short stops in Chinatown.   I don't regret paying $10 for an experiment, but I wouldn't return. So with buzz and no follow-up or virality, the business might hurt in the long run. Fusia Dog is just not coherent enough with their pairings and message. The ingredients were fresh and one could tell everything was made right, but the flavours were slightly off. The space was designed to be quirky, but seeing the backroom in a mess exposed all its flaws. The presentation on a banana leaf boat was excellent, but having it all carried on 50s styled lunch trays detracted from the Asian-ness of it all. Maybe as winter draws near and people are too cold to wait for their street meat, will they entertain the idea of going inside for a taste adventure. But at the end of the day, Dinah's competing with a city of street dog aficionados who are comfortable making their own crazy flavour concoctions and won't be willing to shell out money for her to make those flavour decisions for them."}

{"text":"Fuisa Dog's menu is perfect for a food truck or food stand. I can imagine people lining up for one of their made to order hot dogs which is the perfect street food.  Fusia Dog ($6.95) is a all beef dog wrapped in grilled Indian paratha flatbread and dressed with Korean kimchi, sweetly pickled Vietnamese slaw, fresh coriander and wasabi mayo.   It is just a little tricky to eat as I doubt you can just stuff that in your mouth without making a mess. There is no restroom in the premise for you to wash your hands. I ended up eating that with a fork.  The combination is quite interesting with so many different elements: India, Korea, Vietnam and Japanese. I of course love the wasabi mayo which is the most dominant of them all!  Staffs are friendly and nice. The interior though small and with no decoration but Fusia Dog is more like a takeout joint.   I might come back here if I am in the area with a sudden snack attack!"}
