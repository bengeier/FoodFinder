{"text":"Average food, bad customer service. I walked up and the employee was doing the trash, they looked at me ignored me for a while, no greeting. So I speak up and tell them my order. I then have to take initiative and tell them what since they didn't feel the need to ask what I liked on it. Then after touching a trash bag they proceeded to put gloves on without washing their hands. I have my managerial health card in Arizona and that is unacceptable. I will not return to the Bio Bistro"}
{"text":"The Grumpy Lady referred to in another review is a problem.  The place opens late and closes early.  It is pricey and, even worse, one is charged more than the advertised price.  When I objected to being overcharged, Grumpy Lady was very sour about it, refused to stick to the advertised price and made a snarky remark when I left without my purchase.  I've come to the conclusion that it is worth a walk across campus to get better prices and service.  And the exercise does you good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Friends don't let friends drink Starbucks. This is real coffee drinks made by an Italian trained barista (no fooling) and real sandwiches. Comparable selection to any other coffee shop, and they put pride in what they make. It is excellent, very reasonably priced, and a great vibe behind the counter. I don't get coffee anywhere else on campus, and this is my go-to place when I need that 'second breakfast'."}
{"text":"I've gone here at least weekly since it is convenient to where I work, but today was the last straw. 
The food has usually been okay to very good (I like the paninis and the PB&J croissant), but the lousy customer service is where I draw the line.
One time I asked for a coffee frappe, the server immediately told me they don't serve that and told me I should go to Starbucks. I pointed out the frappes on their menu, she then said the machine was broken. Okaaaayyy...
Today, I requested the soup on their \"daily specials\" menu. I was told they don't have it because \"one person can't handle making everything and serve everybody at the same time.\"  I'm sorry you're understaffed, but that doesn't give you reason to be unprofessional and rude (or put a half-eaten sandwich back on the panini press). 

I'm waiting until when/if the Charlie's in School of Law reopens (and is fully staffed)."}
{"text":"This small coffee shop is tucked inside the ASU Biodesign Institute. It is a good place to stop in for a loose leaf tea (same ones that can be found from Republic of Tea), which is hard to find in the immediate campus area. It definitely beats going to chain stores, like Starbucks, which tend to have low quality teas and poor selections."}
{"text":"This Place sucks, I always have to wait and today i showed up at 7:52am and peeked my head in because the door was opened half way and asked if i could buy a quick drink that was in the fridge already made and my shift starts at 8am she said we dont open till 8am thats why the door was closed, and was very rude about it, I guess i should of let her finish her text before i asked. The lady had a half cut hair cut and was very grumpy!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good selection of food choices in addition to the regular subs/sandwiches. Their veggie korma is full of flavor and the large portion makes it worth the price. 

Their Thai ice tea is a little mild on the flavor, but it might be due to the ice. Will have to try the hot tea before I dismiss their ice tea. They also have a good selection of loose tea for tea lovers. 

The only complain I have for this place is often times, there is only one person working there and he does take his time making your order. But, I have also been around when he is really nice and friendly so it is not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"How is Bio Bistro not yet in the Yelp-osphere!?

This has been my on-the-fly, go-to place for sustenance when busily working away at ASU. It is located in the Biodesign building at McAllister and Tyler, across the way from Psychology. It gets very popular at lunch time, being one of the few easy options on this side of campus, and it definitely beats fighting your way through the sea of undergrads at the MU student center. 

The barista at Bio Bistro is great - a little rough around the edges and he tends to take his time making your drink, but in the end it's worth the wait because he makes foamy latte goodness. They serve 2 types of espresso at your request for the picky espresso drinker in all of us. The strawberry lemonade is also great, and they have a decent assortment of teas. Do remember to stop in after 3pm for Espresso Drink Happy Hour! Half-off all espresso drinks. I know I definitely need a pick-me up around 3:30 to get me through the rest of the day. 

The coffee is a great deal. The food, not such a great deal. I am a sucker for the tuna sandwich, the veggie korma (with yogurt and chutney), and Cajun delight pizza - they are all really tasty and surprisingly satisfying. They also have sandwiches, bagels, pastries, and salads - you can grab something out of the case or get a sandwich made to order. I just find the prices a bit high for the food, but, when I'm hungry and in a hurry, I pop on over for a bite and a latte. 

Bio Bistro is quick, easy, and good - check it out if you find yourself wandering around campus!"}
{"text":"It's an okay place, when you want to chill out in the middle of your experiment!
It's a bit pricy. They have vegetarian options which makes it nice."}
