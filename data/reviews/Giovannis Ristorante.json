{"text":"A friend took me here to celebrate a new job. He has always raved about the burger so naturally I had to try it for myself. The burger was grilled to perfection, I found out they make everything in house - the brioche buns, the ketchup everything. The creme brûlée was delicious! 

I was craving another burger and took another friend back with me later in the week for our fix. She's now addicted."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening of great food, great wine and great service!  The personal touch from the hostess, Sommelier and wait staff made this experience memorable!"}
{"text":"Giovanni's has kind of turned into an annual birthday dinner hot spot for my family so I'll always have a little soft spot in my heart for this place.  I will start out by saying that the new bar area is fantastic - the decor is super contemporary and much more up and a big step up from what it used to be.  

I've always enjoyed my dining experience here, but I can't say that they've all gone off without a hitch.  Our most recent experience, and most of our experiences for that matter, was pretty great - the food was good, the service was excellent, and they made our celebratory dinner one to enjoy.  But we've also had times when the food hasn't been so stellar and the service has been incredibly slow - but hey, everyone's allowed an off day.  The menu hasn't changed in ages, but if it ain't broke don't fix it and they definitely know what works for them because it's been working for years (and my family keeps going back).

I think what I really love about this place is the feeling of sophistication and tradition that comes with dining here.  It's a place where people still take pride in dressing up to dine out and they're on their best behavior.  This isn't somewhere you would expect to find an immature crowd of drunk twenty-somethings getting sloshed on shots and vodka redbulls at the table next to you - this is where people come to sip wine and martinis and eat some simply fantastic food.  

I want to give Giovanni's a 5-star rating, I REALLY do, but what stops me is that I've had better food in this price range at other places around Cleveland.  But if you want the complete dining experience, something unlike anything in Cleveland, you need to check out Giovanni's - at least once because it's something to remember."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and ambiance! Would choose this over Fkemings any day of the week! Servers, maitre de, chef all very attentive. The filet mignon was so tender like a marshmallow!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Some of the entrees are prepared/plated at the table making a very nice presentation.  Food was good; however, my husband and I, who eat very healthy at home, found it to be a little too rich for our tastes.  We will go back, but we 
try to order entrees prepared with less butter."}
{"text":"Some of the best bologna see I've ever had. The penne bolognese is outstanding. The meatballs are insane. I was at a birthday party they catered for a friend and they made the best cassata cake hands down. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. Great food. Great service and s very nice owner."}
{"text":"Good attentive service, great food had the veal chop and short rib both were perfect. The reason for only 4-stars is little overprice!"}
{"text":"From what I viewed of the clientele: Giovanni's is where the upper middle class goes to dine for a special occasion, and where the wealthy go to dine on a regular basis (where do they go for their special occasions?  New York I suppose?).  Nearly everyone there on that Saturday night was known by name to the owner and everyone seemed to know each other.  Lots of fancy cars, and lots of kisses.

I am not rich - I was at Giovanni's for my birthday.  I made my reservation through OpenTable, including a note that it was my birthday, and for the first time ever, it was acknowledged by the waitstaff.  During the past 6 years, that note was always ignored, but not tonight.  Giovanni's is special.  They care.

Every table in the restaurant had a \"reserved\" sign on it, so I guess reservations are recommended on the weekends?  It seemed like we were the only non-regulars in the place, and as such, we ended up with a high-top table by the bar.  Not exactly what I was hoping for, but I guess regulars take priority.

Service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive, gave good recommendations, and engaged in the right amount of cheerful chit-chat.

My boyfriend and I each ordered a four course prix fixe meal, and it was probably the most expensive meal I've ever had.  But it was delicious.

First course: Steak Tartare served in roasted bone marrow (topped with pickled mustard seed) and the House Smoked Salmon Plate (served with capers, mascarpone, and chopped egg).  Both dishes were savory and not too salty.

Second course: Lamb Ragout Pappardelle with mint butter, and Winter Squash Agnolotti (very similar to a ravioli - just crimped differently) with a brown butter sauce.  The mint butter was an interesting twist on the pappardelle - we could definitely taste the mint.  The dish seemed like a fancy version of my Mom's beef stroganoff.  The Winter Squash Agnolotti was my boyfriend's favorite part of the entire meal, by far.  The sweet flavors blended so well with the squash that he wanted to kiss the cook.

Third course: Verlasso Salmon served with a winter vegetable medley and Veal Scallopini served with a crisp potato cake.  The salmon was perfectly cooked - moist and easy to cut - probably the best salmon I've ever had.  The veal was all right, but the potato cake was really amazing.  It was great comfort food.

Dessert: Affogato (cardamom-chestnut honey gelato with cookies) and a peppermint/dark chocolate Baked Alaska.  The affogato came served on a plate with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written on it in a sweet sauce.  Very touching.  The Baked Alaska flavors mixed perfectly.

I couldn't eat like that every day, and I wouldn't want to - then dining at places like Giovanni's wouldn't be special.  But it was great for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Giovanni's never disappoints! I was there last week and had a great pork chop that melted in my mouth! The drinks were plentiful and company was grand! Carl continues to operate a great ship and be a true star in the restaurant industry in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Really good experience as always.   My only complaint is that the prices were significantly inflated on New Year's Eve for all dishes on the regular menu.   Seems quite excessive for the 20-30% premium on an already high priced menu.  

Always a consistently good experience and we will be back, although probably not on any evening when there is a \"special\" menu."}
{"text":"We took a friend for his milestone birthday to what we thought was the best restaurant in Cleveland, Giovanni's. The service was certainly not what one would expect ie it was poor.For example, we had to ask our waiter for bread. I also had to request that the waiter bring me a knife to cut the entrée. When I requested some changes in the entrée because of a food allergy the waiter said it was absolutely not possible. That is hard to believe in a top rated restaurant where everything should be made to order. When gelato was brought out to the table for the birthday it was partially melted in the bottom of the glass. My opinion of Giovanni's is that it is overpriced for what they give you. We were  disappointed and embarrassed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I had the fish with some kind of magical white sauce, it was phenomenol and the trio pasta appetizer was in itself a treat."}
{"text":"This would be a special occasion restaurant for most people.  Even then, it's pricey.  Some of the selections are outrageously priced.  I hope they are worth the cost, but I'm not rich enough to find out.  Service was attentive, professional, and helpful.  Wine and cocktail list is on a tablet.  I didn't scroll through all the wines, but DH said the wine list was great, and he knows wine.  He had 2 wines by the glass and the pours were quite generous.  I had a glass of Prosecco and a french martini, both excellent.  His app was oysters Rockefeller, outstanding.  I\"m not a fan of oysters, but I'd order this and give him the oysters, leaving the creamed spinach and crumb topping for myself.  I had a special app of sweet potato and brussels sprouts salad.  Large portion, probably should not have eaten all of it, but it was delicious.  His main was a scallop dish off the specials menu, with roasted vegetables and a cauliflower bisque as a sauce.  Outstanding.  My main was also a special - 5 enormous shrimp bigger than your head, with the lightest, airiest gnocchi I have ever had, and tiny asparagus and a creamy sauce.  Dessert was a classic, rich creme brûlée.  Lovely atmosphere, lovely service. The dress code seems to have relaxed a bit, unfortunately.  Folks, this is a fine dining experience.  Treat it with respect."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent. However, $110 is over the top for pasta, soup, bread and domestic beer."}
{"text":"Went there for New Years Eve .... place was packed-every table booked ...... ambience,service,food quality all what you would expect from an upscale fine dining establishment . They know what they are doing and do it well . Its a great special occasion restaurant with superb service ...... more than met expectations ."}
{"text":"This is much more than a classic Italian restaurant : it is the classic Italian restaurant.  Hard to say more than has already been written. Suprisingly set in a office tower. But they prepare the pastas table side, and make everything in house.  We had the standout Dover Sole.  Expensive, but perfect.  Just perfect.  And we had the other standout - the veal chop.  Just look at that perfect cut, with just a bit of marbling.  And the cauliflower in cream sauce and sweet fries made it a dish to make a cardiologist cringe, but so very very worth it.  

Our waiter knew every little detail, recommend the wines perfectly"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant on the East Side of Cleveland. The ambiance is great, with a classic look and intimacy of a private dinner. Bar area is accessible and central to the layout. Menu selection is broad, wine selection is good, and the mixed drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"Being of Italian dissent, I was very excited when I got a $100 gift certificate to Giovanni's for Christmas.  I made my reservations on OpenTable and a lady from Giovanni's called to confirm my reservation.  So far so good.  Then, a few hours before my reserved time, I called to see if I can make an edit to my reservation.  The man on the phone indicated that there was NO reservation under my name (even though I had confirmed it with a lady a few hours prior).  He reluctantly agreed to \"fit me in\" at my original reserved time.  

The place was very difficult to find since the signage isn't very recognizable from the street.  Thank goodness for GPS!  I got there on time and was escorted to a small table by the bar.  I was very upset by the accommodations, but decided to try to enjoy the evening and not make a fuss.  I do have to mention that the seats at this table only came up to about mid back range...so I was very sore and uncomfortable about midway through the meal.  About the meal...  

We were offered these tiny breadsticks in a vase that  kinda resembled stems with no flowers.  Thinking that these must taste great being that they were so neat to look at.  Disappointed again.  They tasted like a straw made out of saltine crackers.  One waiter came by with a fancy bread selection that included pretzel bread (how Italian!) and a few other that I didn't recognize.  I went with the warm ciabatta...which was as expected.  

Being Italian...I was looking forward to some good Chicken Parmesan.  To my surprise, there wasn't a chicken dish on the ENTIRE menu.  Really?  I was told to try the Cotolette di Vitello Parmigiano ($44)...so I did.  I absolutely HATE angel hair pasta as it reminds me of Ramen Noodles...so I asked for Penne pasta instead.  In order to get Penne Pasta instead, I had to buy a half order of another entree (+$13).  I bought it...I wanted to enjoy my meal.  My wife asked for water with lemon...the scattered and flustered waitress brought the water without lemon and 10 mins later...still no lemon...after asking a few times.  Being next to the bar, my wife had to go fetch her own lemon wedge.  My wife ordered the Sea Whistle Salmon ($36) and an Organic Mixed Greens salad (+$9).  I asked for a side salad with Italian dressing.  The waitress informed me that they DO NOT HAVE ITALIAN DRESSING!  In an Italian restaurant?  Really??  I opted for no salad instead of forking over another $10 for a Ceasar salad.  

My penne pasta arrived with my wife's salad and the sauce tasted just like Grandma used to make.   The pasta portion was very tiny...but it was good.  My veal arrived looking like a pancake with a long bone sticking out of it.  In the middle of it was a hot pocket of Parmesan filled with Angel Hair Pasta.  I asked for NO Angel Hair Pasta!  I scraped it off...again...I didn't want to complain.  I sliced into this large fried piece of meat and tasted the driest...crunchiest...most tasteless morsel I've ever had.  I asked the waitress if she would be kind enough to bring some of that yummy marinara sauce for me to pour over this dry piece of veal.  10 mins pass...I'm half-way done with choking down the veal...still no sauce.  I again catch her as she was running by to serve what must have been a big wig.  She made some excuse and ran to go get the sauce for me.  She then spilled a little on herself and made some snide comment about how it's a great thing the wait staff wears black since she's so clumsy.  My wife's Salmon was ok at best.  It had this brown stuff sprinkled all around it that kinda resembled dirt.  She wasn't impressed...and she really likes Salmon.  For the two of us to eat, it cost ($140) total.  I've never been so disappointed in my life.  I had to pay $40 in addition to my gift certificate for a meal I wouldn't pay $10 for at an Italian carnival.    

The scenery was nice to look at...definitely a place to people watch.  I wasn't surprised to see hardly any other Italians dining or working there.  It didn't seem very welcoming or authentic to me.  You actually have to leave the restaurant and go into the hallway just to use the restroom!  I was surprised to learn was that there are SO many good reviews on here!  It's like I didn't even go to the same restaurant!  For a 5-star restaurant, I really expected a WHOLE lot more and got a WHOLE lot less.  

If you want home cooked authentic italian food, where chicken is actually on the menu...travel to Pepper's in Lakewood.  It's a tiny little place but the owner will seat you and she'll stop over to check up on you.  Each table has romantic candles lit...Frank Sinatra is playing on the overhead speakers and you don't have to leave the place to wash your hands. The $100 you'll save on the meal can be used to check out a play at Beck Theater.  I wouldn't go back to Giovanni's again if it were free."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great service and welcoming staff. They are very attentive and keeps checking the customer table for any inquiry. Atmosphere is nice, elegant, and dressy. Qualify of food is superior. Their tomato sauce is perfect and authentic. We ordered the sourdough blossom appetizer, cauliflower salad, milk fed veal chop, milk fed veal parmigiana, and cream brûlée. I would highly recommend it. It is a little pricy though but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian in Cleveland. I've been eating there for years. The food is consistently awesome. There is never a a bad meal. The service is hands down the the best. Staff is polite and well dressed. You just don't find service like this anywhere in Cleveland.  
Defiantly a \"go to\" for specials occasions."}
{"text":"Whew this place is expensive - definitely $$$$. 

The food was great. Though, I need to erase it from my memory because I do not want to get used to $45 entrees."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a business lunch meeting.  What separates the men from the boys in great restaurants is when you are offered a black napkin in lieu of the white napkin when you are wearing a dark outfit.  It amazes me how many alleged \"great\" restaurants miss this.  Not Giovanni's.  Very quiet atmosphere so it was great for a private discussion.  Our server was simply outstanding, very experienced and very professional.  He knew when to approach the table and when to leave us alone.  It sounds rudimentary but this guy was good.  We started with the 3-pasta sampler for each of us.  Delicious but damn it filled me up before my primary lunch choice arrived.  I chose the beet salad with grilled salmon.  Again, excellent.  The meal was perfectly paced, the service outstanding, and the food great.  Giovanni's IS stuffy in the dining room.  If you want something a little less stuffy, eat in the bar!  Older crowd for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an appetizer after golf last Friday and were treated at the bar to great appetizers and drinks...I had Clams Casino, which is hard to find out anymore...great dish.....

Great girl named Suzie took care of us like she knew us.....I highly recommend that you stop here if you are in the area....."}
{"text":"IS THERE A WAY TO GIVE THIS PLACE A 10 STAR REVIEW?! Let me just start off first by saying that I go here at least 5 times a week for either lunch or dinner. Hell, I've even gone here twice in one day, it's that fantastic. 

This is by far the BEST restaurant in Cleveland. The food is beyond amazing, the staff are incredibly friendly, and their wine list is spectacular. I was reading through some of the other reviews and I would just like to say to anyone who had anything negative to sat about Giovanni's, you clearly have no care in the world for great food. As I stated before, this is the BEST. 

Whenever I come here, I typically start off with a nice bottle of wine. My typical appetizers are either the seafood board or the beet salad. Then dinner comes along and almost every time I am in I get the veil parmesan. Yes, it sounds very basic BUT, this place knows to make it epic. It is this lovely piece of veil with al dentate noodles on top, smothered in sauce and cheese. That's pretty fantastic if you ask me! Finally, dessert is a MUST. Please, do not skip dessert here, you'll be devastated. Whether I am full or not, I ALWAYS get the bananas foster. Everyone has their way of doing it, but this place knows how to make the best bananas foster in the world (yes, it's that good). 

If you love beyond amazing food, a great ambiance and are looking for a new go to spot, come to Giovanni's. I PROMISE you won't regret it. Oh! If you're on a diet and decide to come here, sorry, but you're diet will have to be held off for a day. You can't stop yourself from eating here!! I still can't find a word to use to describe this food bedsides, it's absolutely fantastic. I recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"The horseradish crusted halibut is out of this world!  Always a great meal.  Great for special moments.  Very romantic."}
{"text":"Giovanni's is a gem.  

I've been here twice with colleagues, once for drinks and once for the tasting menu, and I was struck by the attention and service they paid to my friends and our party.  

The patrons here tend to be a bit older, as well as the wait staff; but that also suggests experience.  The service showed precisely that.  Warm, attentive service and charming ambiance makes for a very enjoyable experience.

The flavours were occasionally a tad heavy handed for me ... but just a tad.  Fresh mozzarella, great pork belly, ribs, papardelle followed by tasty dolci made for an excellent dining experience.

I'd give this a 4.5 - but I don't have the option... but given the paucity of high-Italian dining in Cleveland, I'll average it up to a 5 out of 5.

Molto bene!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. Always has been, always will be. Food, service, location, parking, everything! I can't express how much I love this place, whether it's a salad at the bar by myself or a full meal with friends in the dining room... consistent and flawless. Always."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go here as part as a dinner for work. A place that is delicious!  I will say, getting there was a bit of a challenge as you can see the sign from the street, however, the restaurant is in some awkward looking old building that you wouldn't expect a higher end restaurant in Beechwood.  

Our menu was set when we got there so for the pasta course, we were given a trio of pastas: Cavatelli alla Bolognese, Cappellini alla Arrabiatta and Penne alla Vodka.  I was a big fan of the cavatelli, but all three were delicious.  

We then had the choice of Halibut, Filet Minot and one other entree for the main course.  I had the Halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetables with the bearnaise sauce.  Wasn't a fan of the béarnaise- I thought it had a funky taste to it, but everything else was delicious.  The others at my table ordered the filet and it was cooked to order.

Dessert wise, we had the choice of chocolate mousse, a lemon tart and a homemade sorbet.  The mousse was absolutely delicious.  Even though it was a small portion and light, it was pretty rich. 

This place is good, but it's also on the pricey end.  Food was delicious, however, and I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"Going to Giovanni's is an experience. It is a glimpse into where people with money hang out in Cleveland. 

The restaurant is located in a nondescript location in the first floor of an office building at the intersection of Chagrin Blvd and Richmond Road. The second you step inside, you are are swept away into a completely different atmosphere - swanky and classy, but not too over the top. 

We had a quick dinner at the bar. I was impressed that the bartender took the time to learn our names, considering the bar was fairly busy. I ordered a sweet potato and brussels sprout salad (one of the nightly specials) and my husband ordered the lobster risotto. Both were seasoned perfectly. The risotto was served al dente so that you could taste every grain. We also ordered the \"chef's selection of interesting things\" which had some interesting house-cured meats. 

This restaurant is a great place to go to for a special occasion or on a date, but can be pricey otherwise (though I'd have to say that you get good quality for the price!)."}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends here for dinner. Really pretty restaurant. Well lit and comfortable.  The hostess was very sweet when she welcomed me and at one point when asked for the restroom and a very kind man almost walked me to the bathroom. My complaint about the place is basically the service and how the servers and waitstaff take care of you. My waitress (as was all servers and bussers in the dinning room) was in a huge hurry. Without exaggeration she bumped into me nine times. I literally started counting after the third time. In addition to that, usually at a nice establishment if you're speaking to people at a table and the waiter or waitress approaches you they stand there quietly for a half a second for you to acknowledge them before they start to speak. Not this girl, time and time again she walked up to the table in the middle of a conversation and started asking questions and more or less demanding that we get the show on the road. I had the filet which was cooked improperly. I wanted it medium well. It came out rare. While I was waiting for it to be cooked further the waitress came out to me to explain that the method they used to cook steaks has something to do with boiling water. This method allows them to prepare steaks without having to stick a knife in it to check the temperature. The downside to this is that they don't know if the steak is under cooked or overcooked????????? Okay ......probably need to figure out a new method? In any event this is not a place I would likely return to."}
{"text":"I was taken here for lunch a little while back by one of the beloved physicians I worked for. He was retiring and this was his favorite restaurant. He has since passed and anytime I hear of Giovanni's I think of him. 

I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food and usually will never choose to eat in an Italian restaurant. That's not the case with Giovanni's. I would choose to eat here.... if I were richer and wasn't such a rock 'n roll, blue collar kinda girl. 

The food is delicious and inventive. I sampled a few different dishes. The caprese salad and caesar salads were fresh and delicious. I had veal and it was scrum-diddly-umptious! (I'm sorry baby cow) My sister had a pasta dish that was also tasty. These dishes really couldn't have been any better. 

Service is impeccable. I don't think I've had better, in fact. 

The owner or manager - I'm not sure which - was very present and made sure that everyone was taken care of. Really top notch. 

That said, this is totally your stereotypical hoity-toity place that you would see in movies. There were several tables of fabulously dressed older women who could have been in the \"ladies who lunch\" club. I had the pleasure of being in the restroom while some of them were in there. They were complaining about the bathrooms being \"terrible\" because there was no attendant. That didn't bother me! I'm capable of  getting my own paper towels. 

Probably a good first date type of restaurant if that's your thing. 

Another reviewer said the ambiance could be described as \"grown up and dignified\" - very well put."}
{"text":"Best fine dining Italian food in the city!  There food is amazing!  I go for lunch and dinner.  For lunch, suit in the bar, same menu.  They redid it about a year ago and its beautiful!  For desert at dinner you must have Pierre make you bananas foster tableside!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in the city! Located in the basement of a non descript office building. Plenty of parking. The atmosphere is classy, great bar and dining area. They have a wine room with a huge selection to choose from. The menu is outstanding and the service is exceptional. We opted to sit in the bar and our waitress Michelle was absolutely outstanding, she made our experience wonderfulå

We ordered the chefs collection of interesting things. (house cured salami, porchetta, olives, scrapple, nuts, pickled peppers, pickles, fresh riccota, and toast wedges). Simply delicious! Everything was fresh and flavorful, especially the sweet ricotta. Next trout cevechi w/beer foam, fresh greens and fennel. Definitely interesting, not sure if the beer foam really worked with this dish. To us, it took away from the fabulous fish. It just tasted like beer. Also had the roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, both cooked perfectly and flavor was great, love the addition of almonds to the cauliflower. Also house made meatballs were some of the best we have ever had, the meat was tender and the sauce was simply devine. Finally, the stuffed peppers. The mix of the spicy pepper and fennel sausage was magic. To finish our meal we had three scoops of their house made gelato. (coffee, fig, pistachio). Really nice and creamy, a great ending to a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Classy old school fine dining.  

Given Giovannis' reputation of being the best of the best [of Cleveland, mind you] I was eager to see what all the fuss was about.  Well for one thing, the service was excellent from start to finish.  We were led to our table and cloth napkins were placed in our laps.  Oh so classy.  Bread was immediately brought over and placed on each of our plates.  No clumsy ole basket on the table here.

There was an extensive selection of wines available by the bottle or glass.  The menu had a good mix of pasta, fish, and meat dishes.  My father, who rarely agrees with any cook's execution of 'medium rare,' actually seemed pleased with the done-ness of his lamb chops.  I had the halibut served with Swiss chard and a delicious risotto.  

The ambiance can be described as grown up and dignified.  Not hip and trendy but not old and stuffy either.  As far as the reputation, I agree that they have their s*** together.  This seems like the kind of place you could go for a special occasion and know that everything will go smoothly."}
{"text":"The food, the staff, the service, the ambiance, is an absolute home run."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of restaurants located in office buildings, or about Italian cuisine, but this restaurant made a believer again. The wine selection is excellent and the food is perfect. We had the night's specials, sea bass and pork tenderloin wrapped in pork belly... and they were absolutely perfect. The taste was great, the texture was divine, and the happiness feeling was ever present. Until we saw the check, of course. But oh, well... You only live once. 

The staff is nice, helpful and actually knowledgeable, but you may have to ask very specific questions to get pass the \"that dish is awesome\" or \"its a good dish\" semi-automatic responses. 

If you get the chance, give it a try. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Started with a delicious appetizer: endive salad with pork belly and balsamic figs! Service was incredibly warm, accommodating and efficient, wine selection was top tier! Short ribs were tender and cooked perfectly. Pasta with lamb and mint was spectacular. The freshly made zabaglione with berries dessert brought back memories of Italy. The menu has a wonderful variety, not your run-of-the-mill Italian fare. Don't let the office-building exterior fool you; Giovanni's is a luxurious treat!!"}
{"text":"We visited this place again and it was absolutely wonderful experience.
Very good menu options wine selections and service"}
{"text":"I was a frequent flyer here back in the early 2000s. After golfing with my male friends, I could always stop here with them and enjoy a well poured cocktail by Jimmy and fine meal prepared by the Chef... well nothing has changed!

Seeing a recent review made my besties, my Mommy and I cruise in for Happy Hour.
They have the most elegant, extensive Lounge Menu (at the bar only) for 1/2 price. 
My succulent crusted Scallops were so delicious that I enjoy every bite albeit my seafood allergy! 

Served with a hearty potato cake with creamy center, also accompanied were mushrooms, onions, braised spinach and fennel. OH my!
An entire meal!

The baby sesame breadsticks to fill the tiny space left in your tummy were just what I needed. 

Keep in mind the Lounge menu boasts meat: stuffed peppers, meatballs swimming in marinara to name a few... seafood such as calamari, clamp and mussel pasta... and beef like a filet. I could be exaggerating,  but if I recall correctly, there are 16 items from which to choose.

Last but NOT LEAST, this evening,  the Chef granted a Wish for a 15yr old girl with a terminal brain cancer. To host a dinner party for 28 friends and family. WAY TO GO!!!!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome discovery. The Filet Mignon was extremely tender, but they went beyond the usual by pairing it up with a roasted marrow bone on the side. Brilliant. Filet is a very lean cut of meat, so having that fatty marrow gave it what the cut would have otherwise lacked, even though it was good enough without it. Loved it.

Seafood linguine was fresh, wholesome and served hot. It had large pieces of tender scallops, lobsters, shrimp, all the good stuff on a sauce that I wanted to clean up with bread.

The salmon was juicy, not overcooked, yet had the skin on that was perfectly seared to a crisp -- a sure sign that the chef knows his stuff.

There are two sections -- the modern-looking bar area, and the old-world dining area. Hilariously, the patrons seemed to be segregated by age into these two sections. I'm in my 30s, but we were placed in the old-man section -- I must be aging rapidly.

This restaurant is one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Eccellente!!! Great scene in the lounge. Fabulous menu to choose from. Grand plates and presentation, even finer flavors. I started with a Moscato Di Asti. Ordered a wedge salad. Finished with an espresso. My companion ordered a glass of wine, the Belgian Endive and a double shot of espresso. Both were delicious. The service was perfectly attentive and friendly. 

Can't wait to return! I would love to try their escargot! Yum!"}
{"text":"This was the best Italian I have had in Cleveland if you are looking for a place to go for a special occasion this is it. The food and service was amazing. I got the ricotta lemon artichoke agnolotti which was made with homemade pasta and was out of this world. My boyfriend got the veal scallopini and the veal was so tender it just melted in your mouth. They have an extensive wine list, so it's easy to find a bottle of wine at a price you want to pay. We also got the creme brûlée which was so light and delicious."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. Atmosphere was elegant, and the tables are decorated beautifully. The staff is amazing and know a lot about the food (we had a few questions about one of the plates). They seem to be always walking around with a water container, my glass never got more than half way empty the entire dinning experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience from start to finish - exceptional service, waiter not too stuffy but definitely knowledgeable and attentive. The wine list is the best I've seen in Cleveland, truly extraordinary.

The food left everyone in my party happily abuzz that such a meal could be had in Cleveland (I was new in town, and my guests were only visiting). I can personally vouch for the roast canadian duck with wild risotto, red currants and orange demi sauce, the black angus sirloin strip steak with potato, onion rings and burgundy essence, and the rabbit and sweetbread stuffed pasta in a natural veal reduction with sage and rosemary. Delizioso...

Location isn't stellar - on the first floor of an office building, and the decor is a bit dated. The table scheme could use some work as well, in order to provide more privacy between tables - our nearest table was parallel to us and about two feet away...at times I felt like we were part of our neighbor's party. This, of course, can be cool given the right environment and mood, but take note if you're looking for a romantic meal. There is good seating to be had, but it wouldn't hurt to mention your preference when making a reservation.

Overall, a solid dining experience. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I attend lunch here with a former professor of mine and we had an absolutely delightful time. I was visiting from California and so this was a great spot for a \"special occasion.\" I had the seasonal soup offering which was a squash soup. The serving of soup was very large and tasteful. For the main dish I had saltimbocca- it was full of flavor and served with fresh brussel sprouts, a light sauce and other green vegetables. For dessert we had berries with a cream sauce- wonderfully tasteful!

The server was very attentive and genuinely kind. The hostess was as well. The physical space of the restaurant is elegant and very enjoyable for a cozy winter afternoon. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again for a birthday or anniversary!"}
{"text":"Was there back in the early 80's. Again in the early 90's.  It is NOT my mother's Giovanni's anymore!! New exec chef, tapered down and inspired menu, awesome patio!!  Still a great place for special celebrations, yet too good not to go there for regular meals.  Short ribs to die for!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place with excellent food and an old-school Italian feel any beautiful classy restaurant. The food is first rate and the service is unbelievable. I recommend any of their food there and the desserts are amazing especially the bananas Foster which they make a table side. This is a pretty elegant restaurant so I would dress nice to go there. No Jeans or tennis shoes. Super classy for a date night or a family dinner or a holiday or just for anytime."}
{"text":"Truly as good as it gets. I am still drunk off of the good mood this place left me with last night (that and the Chianti).

My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and had such a good time. I really can't wait to have an excuse to come back again.  Easily the best restaurant in Cleveland and top 3 all time for me. Side note- Some reviewers have mentioned this is a good first date choice but I think its a bit too stuffy and serious for that. Save this for a special occasion with someone you're comfortable with and can just enjoy the delicious fancypants night with, without any pressure.

Before I get into the food- yes this restaurant is in the weirdest location in the middle of corporate office area Beachwood, inside an ugly generic office building off of a busy road. Doesn't matter though once you get in, so don't fret.

So onto the food:

Appetizer- Charcuterie plate. All sorts of cured meats, and I think all are made in house. The balsamic glazed figs + the prosciutto were my favorite. This dish was huge by the way- it says for 2 but I'd say 4.

Salad- Belgian Endive- Not that we really needed any more food, but our waiter convinced us and I am so very happy he did. SO GOOD. i know its just a salad but oh it was so so good. Balsamic figs, gorgonzola, candied almonds, pork belly, roasted peaches.. you must get this.

Entrees- I got the long bone veal shank and it was done perfectly. There's not much more to say about it, it was exactly as described on the menu but done so well and was so flavorful. My boyfriend got the Dover Sole and it was also really really good. $60 might sound steep for that but we thought it was well worth it. Buttery delicious melt in your mouth goodness.

Desserts- Cassata cake and Tiramisu. These were probably the least impressive aspects of the whole night. If I chose one again it would be the Tiramisu. Both were good but just good, Corbo's in little italy has my heart for cassata cake though.

Service was very good, everyone was attentive, experienced, etc. Its a pretty formal and serious ambiance, but not as intimidating or hoitytoity as some would make you believe.  Our waiter was very friendly and encouraged us to box up our dishes as we went along when we realized how much we ordered, which normally in places like this is just too tacky and taboo to consider asking for. I couldn't be happier to have Round 2 at home though. Yum.
 
As for value, I think its 100% on point. You can spend as much at Lola's and get a 2 star meal, or come here and get a 5 star meal. Yes its pricey but its easily worth it. 

Really just a great experience overall, I am looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Good food and waitress service, but we were treated rudely by the maitre' d.  I won't return as long as he is there.

I returned with a group for a private party.  The food was good and the service was excellent, but once again the maître d was m.i.a.  Why does this place employ one, since he is obviously disinterested?  Several members of our group are regulars.  One would think he would have at least catered to them.

Update:  Food still good, but snubbing continues.  I wish I owned the place so I could fire him."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Cleveland and probably one of the finest Italian places in the country!  Your first time here, you immediately notice the service and food are held to great standards.  Cleveland is known for having a \"Little Italy\" and some really good restaurants abound this not-so-glamorous city but Giovanni's is a rare gem.  Everything is homemade and you can tell there's a family history of great food coming out of their kitchen.  If you are willing to spend and looking for a great date spot or want to impress a business client, take them here...a reservation ahead of time is not a bad idea."}
{"text":"This is old school class and elegance.  There is nothing else really like this in Cleveland, and only a very small handful of restaurants in the state that are in any way comparable.  Giovanni's has been in business for 35 years and having dined there last night with someone who's been there a number of times over those 35 years, it's been confirmed that the quality has not slipped with the trends toward more casual, more mass-produced food.  No, Giovanni's hasn't changed a bit because it hasn't had to.

A sign to the left of the elaborate entrance doors in an otherwise nondescript Beachwood office building indicates \"Jackets Preferred.\"  How many restaurants are left in Ohio that request or require jackets?  I think I can count them on one hand.  

The food was positively exquisite.  I ordered the veal sweetbreads as a starter.  They were served with escargots, fingerling potatoes, asparagus, bacon, and a beurre blanc.  This dish may have been the best composed dish I've ever consumed.  It was just so perfect that I seriously considered requesting a double portion for a main course.  Sweetbreads are almost always good, but these could not have been made to be better.  I ordered the short rib for my main course, and this was also outstanding.  Decadent.  The brussels sprouts, which I order at every nice restaurant I visit, were delicious, the fingerlings were perfectly cooked as they were in my first course, and the short rib itself was just overwhelmingly rich.  I've never seen a short rib on such a long bone, by the way.  This was a 10\" bone.  A short rib only technically, I assure you.  For dessert, I had the cheesecake, my long-time weakness, and it was great, although certainly nothing particularly special.

I also had the pleasure of trying the Caesar salad which tasted like a milder version of one I like to prepare tableside at home, and I'd say it was better than mine.  More sublte but full of flavor.  My wife had the pumpkin ravioli which were so far ahead of any pumpkin or butternut squash ravioli we've had anywhere, and one of us usually orders this if it's an option.  I did not have the steak tartar although that was my second choice for an opener.  Someone at our table ordered bananas foster, and it was very good.  The gentleman preparing it tableside has been doing it for 32 years at this very location.  Many dishes are prepared tableside including most (if not all) pastas, the wedding soup, and the expected flambeed desserts (bananas foster and cherries jubilee).  One member of our party ordered the Dover Sole, which was taken apart masterfully beside our table.  You don't get this kind of service at many places these days.  My wife ordered the creme brulee, and it was good to very good.  The best I've ever had is from Hartmut Handke (Columbus), and I've never had any as good as his.

Our server, Chris, was a treat.  He is probably not used to a group that likes to laugh and have so much fun, but he handled us well.  As I said when I opened this review, Giovanni's is old school.  Most of the patrons are older and very wealthy.  I saw some really garish looking people last night.  There was a woman that was wearing a pound of makeup, and this makeup probably cost more than saffron.  Few of these people were laughing or carrying on.  They expect white glove treatment and no funny stuff.  But, I'm thankful for these people.  Without them, Giovanni's would cease to exist.  There are plenty of young people with enough money to keep a place like Lola or Lolita going, and I love those places.  But, Giovann's is not chic or trendy.  I'll bet most people reading this review have never heard of the executive chef, Zach.  One does not go to Giovanni's to be a part of some kind of new cultural trend.  My generation could not sustain this restaurant.

One goes to Giovanni's to experience dining perfection.  And I was not disappointed in this regard, not even a little.  Probably in my top 5 meals all-time, and this includes a number of other 4-diamond and a couple of 5-diamond restaurants.

The only things that could have made the experience any better were (1) a more architecturally interesting space, (2) a better view, or (3) a more exciting or exclusive location.  None of these very minor desires would have made the actual culinary adventure any better.

If you want the best in Cleveland, I'm not going to say that this is it (because that can be subjective), but I will say you have to at least spend one evening at Ristorante Giovanni's.  It will reset your expectations for fine dining."}
{"text":"I was SO lucky to have found this place near the Marriott I was staying in last week.  Dinner was so amazing that I dragged my boyfriend to eat lunch with me here the next day right before our flight!  I wanted to try everything!  For dinner we started with an eggplant appetizer.  It was cold which surprised me, but still delicious as it was marinated and charred and seasoned.  I have never had anything like it!  The spices on it were fantastic, and it was drizzled in evoo, watercress and goat cheese.  Next he had a pasta dish- I think a ravioli filled with meat that I honestly was not too keen on.  My dish however was SPECTACULAR.  Maybe the best meal I have EVER had and I have had the privilege to eat in almost every fine dining establishment in Las Vegas.  My entrée was a lamb shank that fell off the bone into a sauce that had tomatoes, radishes, brussel sprouts and some cippolini.  I ate all my vegetables and I am not normally one for roots.  The lamb in itself was so good that it was a shame I could not finish it nor take it to my hotel room because we had no fridge.  I was also too full for dessert or a cappuccino.  My waitress was a beautiful raven-haired girl.  Service was stellar.  Her service and kindness really helped me go back the next day without any hesitations.  She was not there, but my server this day was also good.  I had calamari that could have been cooked longer, meatballs- excellent and just what you would want from a meatball!  I also tried the Caesar salad just to see how it compared to other Caesars and it was great with a very nice, nutty, thin Parmesean on top.  I did also start with a cappuccino.  My boyfriend again chose a pasta dish that I think he was happier with this time.  This is by far one of the BEST meals I have ever had.  I can't believe it is in Ohio in a random (to me) city!  Do yourself a favor and try it here if you have not been!"}
{"text":"Too oily, too salty, too expensive. 

This place has come and gone.  What was once a prized restaurant in Cleveland is now a sorry place hanging onto its past and eventual demise.   I was there with my family and a bunch of 80-year-olds.  The waitress was very friendly and customer service oriented. The food came promptly and the appetizers were decent. When the pastas came they were so heavily salted and oily that I could barely even eat them. In addition to the excessive salt, a pool of at least a quarter cup of oil was at the bottom of my bowl. When I mentioned that to the waitress she said that the chef would be right over to discuss it with me.   Then there was sort of a hubbub going on with the staff and the chef never came over. The waitress came back and asked \"didn't he come talk to you\" to which I said \"no.\" Then she left again and came back and told me that she took the most offensive pasta off my bill. It seems that if you're not an old family or someone well-known in Cleveland, they treat you like you are not worth the bother. They have no reason to do so since their quality is now sub subpar.  The food used to be good enough to offset the office building atmosphere. No longer. Good riddance. Too many other excellent restaurants in Cleveland. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This nice restaurant is located inside an office building, which is such an unfortunate location for a place this nice and the only reason I simply cannot give it 4 stars. Excellent chicken parm. The service was absolutely spectacular. The prices are steep but given the location, I find them to be a little over the top. I enjoyed the visit as a one time experience, but probably would not return."}
{"text":"The food was great - the service on the other hand was horrific. Tried to do a nice thing for my bf by giving the hostes my CC so the bill was already paid for when the check came; however, they forgot and the bill came without my CC having paid for it. I had to tell the waiter who then conferred with the hostes and realized.  Horrible. Ruined the whole surprise. They treated us terribly for such a \"high class\" restaurant. A bunch of bougies - they wouldn't know high class if it hit them in the face."}
{"text":"First time  diners  here to celebrate  
Very happy with the food and the experience. 
EVERYONE  was professional  and the service was smooth and helpful, not overbearing. 
The menu took some study and explanation, but the time was well worth it. 
Every one  loved his choices."}
{"text":"I always loved Giovannis, my husband and I go here for our anniversary every year. However, I don't know what has happened to this once great place. 
I started my meal with a caprese salad. It was so sweet that after a few bites I couldn't eat anymore. 
Then came my fillet, $42.00, worth it if its great. I asked for medium, and it came medium well. But the worst was the middle was so full of fat and grissle, I could hardly cut it. They gave me a free desert, big deal. Although, it was a good dessert. 
My husbands meal was good and service was great. But after spending $170 dollars I wished we would have gone somewhere else. My parents went a  few nights later and had a similar bad experience. I am so sad to rate them only 2 stars. In the past it would have been worth a 4.5 rating."}
{"text":"I don't usually like gnocchi but Giovanni's was excellent. My shrimp was cooked perfectly, and both my husband's and my portions were large. Excellent wine selection. The carrot cake dessert was pretty amazing. I felt underdressed in jeans so I would recommend business-casual clothing."}
{"text":"Based on our most recent visit, four stars. When I visit a restaurant I'm always looking for value. Given the prices here, I expect to be impressed and good food is not sufficient to earn 5 stars at an expensive restaurant. The entire experience needs to border on perfection.

Right now, they're close, but not 100% there. They have a new menu, and I wonder if they have worked out all of the kinks.

* Steak was good, but not great.
* Gnocci were a little on the heavy and starchy side, but the duck sauce was excellent. 
* The crispy pork belly appetizer lacked the distinct taste and texture of pork belly, so the result was that it tasted like any other chunk of crispy pork.
* Service was excellent.

The entree portions are huge. Nobody at our table finished their entree. If the chef would like my opinion, I recommend cutting entree portion sizes down to what normal humans can eat and perhaps bring the prices down to match that. Truly great restaurants encourage you to savor your meal by serving exactly the right size plates so that you don't feel overstuffed by the end. 

I would like to return to try the early seating menu.

I would also like to point out that two of the 2* reviews below are from a single couple reviewing a single experience. I don't think that's fair."}
{"text":"Good food and waitress service, but we were treated rudely by the maitre' d.  I won't return as long as he is there.

I returned with a group for a private party.  The food was good and the service was excellent, but once again the maître d was m.i.a.  Why does this place employ one, since he is obviously disinterested?  Several members of our group are regulars.  One would think he would have at least catered to them."}
{"text":"I give Giovanni's a 5 star, such an old school charm and the service is impeccable.  Our server, Brain, is so nice that my wife want to bring him home.  The atmospheres and the décor are classic restaurant.  It is suited for romantic and date dinning.  Your date will definitely impress.  No wonder they have been AAA 4 diamond award.   Reservation is recommended in the weekend and holiday.
 
The helper offered oven baked fresh bread is so good that my wife have three of them.  We order two starters: Octopus Carpaccio and special 4 oz. Grade \"A\" Foie Gras.  My wife has the pickled beets salad and I have the Wedding soup.  The Octopus is just OK but the grill Foie Gras is excellent and worth the $30 price tag.  The soup is tasty and the beets salad is right at the money.  I have the recommended Veal Chop with perfectly cooked to medium rare as I requested.  My wife has their Linguine with calms, escargot and black truffle.  They served the linguine table side and the manager patiently rearranged the calm shell top of the plate after the re-heat process.  The black truffle infused linguine taste so yummy with the calm and escargot sauces.  Warning: the dinner portion is large, good for next day lunch.

Giovanni's is a gem in the Cleveland, such safe bet for a romantic and date dinning spot."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the last couple of years and couldn't tell you what a gem this is in Beachwood.    Renovations they did over last couple years made the place beautiful.   My favorite is the outdoor dining and patio they have created.    Great for large events and groups.    Super friendly staff, courteous and go above and beyond for the dining experience.    Definitely try the Veal Parm possibly the best I have had in the city!       New specials (they have a daily menu as well) each day so I can always try something new."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to an exceptional dinner at a fine dining establishment, which led us to Giovanni's.  Unfortunately, the restaurant did not live up to the reviews.  

We arrived at the restaurant on-time for our reservation and were promptly seated at a small table in the corner by the bar.  Our server came over to present us with the menus, and we were blown away by the \"special\" New Year's Eve menu.  The menu was actually the normal menu with a 10-25 dollar premium added to each item.  We did not know this was the case, and decided not to leave since the restaurant imposed a 50 dollar fee for those who did not keep their reservations.

Staff:  The waitress was very friendly, but not very knowledgeable about the items on the menu.  She had a difficult time describing the items.  Also, there were other patrons who arrived after us, and were served before us.  The service was slow.

Food:  This was the biggest disappointment with the restaurant.  My fiancée ordered the $30 angel hair pasta, only to have it arrive cold and overcooked.  Furthermore, the pasta was not homemade.  For the price being paid, one would expect to receive quality homemade pasta.  

I ordered the ribeye knowing it was a fatty piece of meat.  Unfortunately, 3/4 of the serving consisted of fat and the entree was cold.   This was a big letdown.

Overall:  Granted, New Year's Eve is a busy time for restaurants and one should expect to receive a limited menu with higher prices.  However, one would also expect a restaurant with such high marks would leave us blown away with a quality experience.  We were blown away but for all the wrong reasons.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with my family over the holidays. The food was excellent classic Italian with a nice high end presentation. 

The wait staff was attentive and the presentation was excellent as well. 

Wine list was exhaustive. When all the bottles are in stock (my first choice was not) you can select the right bottle for your evening."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant, but was sorely disappointed.  I was with a group of 8 for a business dinner and I ordered a veal dish, similar to a veal Parmesan.  Our server told me that it was a veal chop which was pounded thin, then breaded and topped with spaghetti.  The veal was pounded so thinly that all I could taste was the breading.  And guess what?  It was $42!  Two of my colleagues ordered some type of ravioli that they barely touched.

To be honest, I didn't complain about how horrible I thought the dish was, so they didn't have a chance to make things better. My bad.

The service was 5 star.  

This was my second visit to this restaurant.  On my first visit, the food was not any better.  Business brought me to this restaurant, but if it were up to me, I would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Outstanding service, delicious food & drinks.  Great crowd too.  Ordered off the bar menu and it was excellent!  Great Caesar Salad, stuffed peppers with sausage AND the roasted marinara sauce was fantastic!  I'd go again in a heartbeat - fantastic service!"}
{"text":"Giovanni's is AMAZING! I was visiting from California and just happened to find this place...and FINDING it is probably the hardest part because it's inconspicuously hidden in an office building. But, I'm so glad I did. We were a party of 5 and each of us enjoyed every incredible course! I'd go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Excellent attention and service.  Wine selection great as well.  Bread is out of style and was not fresh and this includes the pretzel rods.  Salads excellent but pastas overcooked and sause/ pastas did not taste homemade.  I will defintely be back, but I will keep it simple and order from the bar menu only."}
{"text":"Great wine selection.  Wedge salad was good but wife had way too much dressing on hers.  My bone in filet was cook medium+ not med-rare.  Filet was over-all cold too.  Wife's dish was pasta and it was okay per her. The Creme Brule was very good - 5 stars.  Atmosphere was very nice as well but a bit crowded.  Of course I got seated in a location that the servers used to get to diners so every 3 minutes someone brushed my back as they passed.   Service was less than stellar....I don't even recall the server checking in on how our meals where.   Enjoyed our time but for the price I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"First time dinner here and very good experience. I like the cioppino here and the soup is a little bit spicy and very special."}
{"text":"We have loved this restaurant for most of our relationship.  We give them 4 or 5 star reviews every time and have spent many a paycheck here because we love the food and the atmosphere and especially love the new bar area.

We came in last night to celebrate our 7.5 year anniversary, sweetest day (yes, a week late) our anniversary of our engagement and our wedding (2 weeks ago).  We had to cancel the week before because i re-broke my ankle.  (BOOOO)

We sat at the bar and were greeted warmly by the host - hey!  we come here about 5 times a year.  And they knew it was a special occasion!  And I was in a lovely air boot! The bartender, who has served us a number of times, was especially cold, border rude, and didn't want to be bothered.  Our appetizer, somewhat of a charcuiterie came out ICE COLD - usually a meat and pate selection is brought to somewhat temperature, rather than slivers of ice.  When I asked, he told me it just came out of the cooler and that was that.  I was made to feel STUPID.  I have had cheese and pate plates from many fine dining places and they should not be this cold and my question shouldn't be shaken off like I am a child.  (i DO look young!)

Our main meal was pretty good, but skimped on the seafood this time for our pasta dish. 

So, what was supposed to be an amazing and special night, was just bleh.  I'm sorry, Giovanni's, i think you and I are done :("}
{"text":"It was told to me to be such a \"romantic place.\" So, we booked this place for our anniversary dinner, got there in cocktail party attire, and were so disappointed. Our service was interminably slow and not so nice. And when I finally got my salmon, it was so dry and overcooked, I could not eat more than one bite. Literally. I really should have sent it back. But it was so fancy and so expensive, I felt intimidated. I would never recommend that anyone I liked go to this restaurant. Definitely don't trust your special occasion to this place! Beware."}
{"text":"We went there tonight to celebrate my birthday. Our waiter is very friendly and professional. The food is great, too. I had halibut and my husband had the New York strip. The halibut exceeded my expectation. I had a great time, and I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, the most consistent, amazing restaurant in Cleveland. Impeccable service. I was wearing a black dress, the napkins were white, as I went to sit down the waiter asked me if I wanted a black napkin. Little details are everything. The food indulgent and prepared perfectly. Wine list, unreal. Bar area great for a more lively experience and the dining room for occasions. Love Love Love this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Overrated.  Very expensive, very average food.  Judging by the crowd in here, you must have to be very rich and very old to enjoy it.  Go to Marbella down the street instead."}
{"text":"Very good food. Older crowd, small bar area. Waiter read desserts available & had to ask what the other table ordered for dessert that was prepared tableside (not sure why he didn't offer the info). Calamari & crabcakes were delicious."}
{"text":"Times must be tough. 

I love Giovanni's. It has always been my go to restaurant for special occasions and the occasional surprise fine dining experience.  I love the service, the food, the great wine selection. Everything except the current crop of customer. I wouldn't dream of stepping into this oasis of sophistication and class without a jacket. Let's face it, you can get really good food and stellar service at any one of a number of great dining locations in this city. What sets Giovanni's apart is the feeling that you are in restaurant that transports you back to the days where ladies and gentlemen dressed up to go to the local diner. But last night I felt like I was at McDonald's.  Men in jeans....loud, rude. It ruined the experience for us. I know it doesn't sound like much, but remember where we were. One of the last remaining bastions to the entire fine dining experience. So please, establish a dress code and stick to it. I know that any business hates to turn down customers, but one more experience like that and I will have a hard time spending $500.00 on a meal when part of the enjoyment is taken away."}
{"text":"Very classy and elegant. Service great and friendly. We had the early dinner special. Large portion of Filet Migon with whipped potatoes, and brussel sprout veggie mix. It was very filling and delicious, the special also came with a choice of a salad and dessert. The specials are $24.95 and the Filet was $5.00 extra. But well worth the money for what you get. Figure you spend that much for a good steak dinner at the Outback and don't even get the dessert . Will for sure go back there for a great meal!!!!"}
