{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch.  It's in a great part of town close to some really unique looking homes.  It was many months ago, but all I remember is... the service was fab, the food was fresh and everything overall was delightful.  

I just remember tasting freshness in their dishes!  Small restaurant, few seats, small menu selection... but... it's delightful!  They have these fries to die for!  I don't know where they get them, or how they marinate them, or how they're deep fried... but they should set up their own kiosk for these fries at the CNE in the summertime!

Very cute and trendy kinda hot spot!  :)  If you take the streetcar... or even drive there, you're bound to miss it because it's slightly tucked away.  It's worth the search though!"}
{"text":"Jamie Kennedy's locavore cabin tucked away along Eastern is a GEM for brunch.  Had a  French toast that walloped my buds with a blend of the pistachio sauce and maple syrup.   What a combo!  The breakfast bangers were moist and the maple coffee cake was a delectable end to a satisfying breaky.  

The ambiance is one of the most cozy in the city with its mason jar-lined cabin walls and chalk board menu.  The service was incredibly efficient and friendly given the packed house. 

I would only suggest that when a customer requests for \"the most popular dish\", or asks the wait staff for his favourite, that he recognize a suggestion is being requested (perhaps for time or genuine interest in the waiter's opinion).  

Otherwise a great experience overall."}
{"text":"The strawberry yogurt is served with granola,hazelnuts, and maple syrup and is super delicious. Bottomless coffee is another reason this is such a delightful place for a breakfast."}
{"text":"I just got back from Sunday brunch full and satisfied. The breakfast was delicious and nutritious. I ordered the hash with two eggs on top. It was a Tex Mex version today and it came in a hot little iron skillet. I can't rave about it enough. The hash had potatoes, beans, root veggies, squash. My date had the bacon roasti with cheesy eggs and liked it a lot. The portions are the perfect size and are presented perfectly.

The restaurant is tucked down an alley named Gilead Place off King East. Don't blink or you'll miss it! Inside, the restaurant is very casual with jars of preserves that line the walls.  It's clean, industrial and bright. The brunch menu was presented on a little clip board and featured something for everyone.  

Our service was prompt and our food came quickly. The restaurant was packed with a steady flow of people. The tables were big which made it feel a bit condensed but whatever, the food was so good.

** It is not an inexpensive place to go for brunch but If you want a brunch that will knock your socks off, this is the place. **"}
{"text":"Oh, gosh, been here too many times to count, used to be once, twice a week, couple of years ago, whenever we get a craving for the poutine, but the last couple of times, I thought, this is just barely passable now.  Have I changed?

FOOD

Love JK for being on the forefront of local and just making food a social, communal affair, not just diners out for eats, events and collaborations up the wazoo, and I think for catering level of food, his stuff is gonna measure up.

But I'm getting better brunch many other places nowadays.  Had the salmon, had oh what else, and I thought, mmm, meh, bland, or boring, or not terribly well paired, I think, really, just boring, and the execution, oh, too many underlings, student chefs, it's just like it is at Nadege (beautiful croissants when first open, now several generations removed, just enough little screw-ups with the original process that it's just avg), the talent or the passion (if it's JK in the kitchen doing Sunday brunch, which I kinda doubt) is not there.

SERVICE (5 Stars)

Superb, really good team!  Pronto to you as you glance up.  3 or so watching the room.  The take-out, refrig options in tarts, deli, whatnot, all fine, ya know, bit better than Pusateri's.  One guy, esp, is a megawatt of \"like me\", holy lightning eye contact, seemingly a genuine love of customer service, or borderline sociopath/neurotic (not the wicked kind, but the adopt the 100 homeless kittens kind).

Nice folk, good, pro, empty or busy.  I'd def cater from them."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant ever since I moved to Toronto a year and a half ago. I was so excited when I knew that I would finally be visiting Gilead Cafe. I am so happy that I did, because I can stop wondering and move on to much better restaurants.

I wanted to like this place so much. I love the style, the ambiance and how tucked away it is. Unfortunately, I absolutely hated it. Hate is a strong word. I use it carefully. I hated this place. And I am only referring to the food. 

We ordered the cheese platter. It came with three different cheeses. I asked which cheeses I could chose from and the server/cashier told me \"cheddar, 2 cow's milk ones and a sheep's milk one and i think another one\".

The cheeses were nothing special. I love cheese. I was disappointed. But i let it slide.

We got our mains. I got the scallops and chorizo with polenta. The scallops (hard to screw up) were awful. Tasted like they had gone bad. I couldn't eat them all. Chorizo was fine. The polenta was gross. I can't even describe the texture. BUT the absolute worst part of my dish was the tomato sauce that my food sat in. 50% of my plate was filled with a tomato sauce that tasted like Ragu. Just awful. 

My girlfriend got a burger. It tasted like it came from Harveys. Just boring.

A lot of people love this place and they are very busy, so they must be doing something right. Whatever they are doing wrong happened to be what I ordered. 70 dollars for a horrible lunch. Skip it."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Sunday for brunch at around 11:30. I was afraid we'd have to wait a while since we didn't make reservations but we were seated immediately.

We started with the Gilead brunch pastries with crème fraîche & jam ($5 per person). We only ordered one serving for the two of us to share. It came with two pieces of dense cakey bread, two pieces of brown bread, one small croissant and one small raison scone. I particualrly enjoyed the dense cakey bread and all the pastries tasted really nice with the preserves. The croissant tasted better than it looked (when it first came, I thought it looked like one of those croissants you buy at the grocery store). If you just want a light brunch, you could certainly just order this with a coffee.

I also had the bacon rosti with cheesy scrambled eggs ($13). The eggs were lightly scrambled, just how I like them - nothing worse than overcooked, rubbery eggs! I actually exepected the eggs to be a bit more cheesy, but they were still good. The rosti wasn't as crispy as I would've liked since the eggs were sitting on top of them. Overall a decent dish.

My boyfriend ordered the hash with sunny side up eggs & greens ($12), which was served in a small cast-iron pan. I had a few bites and wasn't particualrly fond of this dish. It consisted of chunky potatoes, some cooked greens and a lot of beans.

The atmosphere here was really nice and relaxed. Overally a decent experience, but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch.....the brunch menu is great and different.... But what I like to do is choose item a la carte from the front counter....the fries are one of the best in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Really cute spot, great wine selection and the food was delicious. Service was friendly but our waiter seemed very confused, he brought us the wrong wine and then the wrong dish, twice. We thought he may have been new."}
{"text":"Horrible. Never going back. Rude service, staff messed up on serious food allergies despite much careful explanation. Hope Jamie Kennedy pays attention and trains his staff to treat all customers with respect. Overrated."}
{"text":"Guess what? Pickled beets can melt in your mouth. Believe it.

The food here is unbelievably great. The local, organic, well thought out menu changes seasonally. I've never had the JK fries, but this place is my local for lunch and I think I've gone through about 1/3 of the menu, no disappointments yet. 

My only caveats would be the smallish portions and the price. Not cheap.

Oh! And the staff (at lunch) are lovely! All of the folks at the counter are exceptionally sweet, helpful and knowledgeable. Every once in awhile JK will poke his head out of the kitchen and survey the room."}
{"text":"Fave brunch place in Toronto.

Also have a great rotating menu.  I've had the Howdy Pard'ner but even that dish changes. Mine had roasted eggplant and red pepper with feta on bread.  The bread gave it crunch, the veggies were roasted to perfection and the feta added a little saltiness.  I had their french toast which was on brioche bread and served with a caramel like sauce.  It was sweet but not too sweet, buttery and the brioche was amazing.  Their salad which was served with i think sliced turnips had great color and texture.  Gilead's fries live up to the reputation of Jamie Kennedy's fries - perfectly crispy.  They have fresh squeezed juices and love their americanos.

Sure this place is a bit pricier but stay away from the mimosas (but are they worth it) and it'll be a reasonable bill.  This isn't your typical fries, eggs and bacon fare, it's a step above and I think the food is worth the price.

Love the place itself, lots of natural lighting, very casual atmosphere. I loved the mason jar lined walls. You can almost miss this place as it's tucked away from king st.

Service - depends who you get.  There is one waitress who is very slow but the rest are great and I notice them trying to pick up the slow one's slack, haha.  They are good with any recommendations."}
{"text":"It's one of Jamie Kennedy's creations and so I knew that all his ingredients were local or even grown in his own farm and he specializes in bringing the best out of seasonal produce.  This spot is in Corktown (the area borders the Distillery district and Leslieville) and if I didn't look it up, I really don't think I would've stumbled onto this casual mid-day spot. It's on a quiet street, surrounded by industrial vacant buildings.
There are sandwiches, baked goods, salads and of course Jamie Kennedy's famous poutine which changes daily.  Today's poutine was a braised lamb poutine which of course we order.  
The poutine is a healthy portion and the lamb is sweetly braised and pairs well with the french fries, curds.  The gravy is very thin and seems almost like the lamb jus. I like it although my preference is always a traditional Montreal style poutine"}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe that has a ton of charm. It is tucked away on an alleyway. My food was simply yummy and the desserts here are all impeccable! I came here with family  and was pleasantly suprised. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"For dinner: very small portions and extremely expensive prices.
We spent $40 for 2 and drank water.  it's too expensive for what you get, so we won't be back....

For coffee and a croissant in the morning, it's a lovely cafe with wooden chairs and lots of light."}
{"text":"Tucked away on a little alleyway between Eastern and King, this place offers up some tasty treats to eat in or take-out, in a cafe style atmosphere. You've probably heard of Jamie Kennedy's latest venture, a front for his catering kitchen. 
We went on a Sunday afternoon and it got pretty busy. Apparently, there are two cash registers, but little directing, so my friend and I were waiting patiently, with no acknowledgment from the staff (5 people). The staff that worked there looked completely frazzled and frankly a bit annoyed that the cafe was getting busy. Right away, I was not impressed. You will see time and again, I will credit or discredit service at a place I eat, because I feel it's extremely important. How can anyone enjoy their meal when met with a crabby face and tones of attitude.That is not to say that I won't go back to a place if the service is crap, but the food had better be amazing otherwise. Anyway, I digress.
The cafe itself is warm and sunny with rows and rows of jarred fruity items along one wall. There are tables to sit at or a counter along the window with stools. We both ordered the daily poutine which turned out to be a lamb patty one. The flavours of the lamb were smoky and lovely. Not a lot of gravy and the cheese was more like bits of shavings rather than \"curds\". Luckily, the flavour, the lamb, and the fries themselves made up for that, and I suppose Kennedy wasn't trying to go for a soppy \"New York Fries poutine\" interpretation here. Fair enough. 
One thing I have to say about the set-up is the disorganization of it all. There's 1 runner, who brings out your food and basically calls around your name until you put up your hand or acknowledge yourself. Perhaps, they should try a more efficient method like giving people numbers and then the runner can quickly identify the patrons OR just have the people pick up their own food?
Despite my initial distaste of the service, it was my first time there...so maybe it was just an \"off\" day, hence the 3/5...I definitely would give it another go and try a few other things next time. Like the soup. That looked good."}

Gripe: Ignored by wait staff, food was impressively bland for prices and reputation

I hate for my first Yelp review to be a negative one as I've had such great experiences in many places around Toronto but this place forced me to share our disappointing experience.  From the start, we were ignored by the wait staff and had to often grab someone to get anything that came close to service.  Once we got our food, the Cobb salad was bland and looked like something anyone could have assembled in a back kitchen.  I had such high hopes for this place as I love the neighbourhood and had chosen this for brunch for my birthday.

Thankfully Skin and Bones made up for it later that day with a spectacular dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in the city. Unique features + the classic brunch staples.  High quality food with fresh local ingredients.  A great place to take friends and family if you want to impress! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It is what we would call in Europe a great neighborhood cafe, but it is largely overrated as a place to go for lunch/dinner out. 
1) it is pricey
2) the service at the counter was really obnoxious and not friendly  (it is self service)  

3) we ordered 5 dishes to try it out. 
blackened cod was a complete disappointment (wanted to send it back). 
hamburger was good. 

the rest was nothing special to remember.  

Sorry, Torontonians, I disagree with you that this is the place to take your gourmet friends to.
If you live in the neighborhood - yes, probably.

 But this is not good enough to show to any well travelled person."}
{"text":"Gilead cafe has been on my Toronto brunch to-do list for awhile. A friend had a groupon she was dying to use, so today was the day.

I can't remember the actual name of the dish I ordered but if I were to re-name it, I'd call it \"Mountain of awesome fries with fried eggs and homemade sausage on top\". The fries really were so awesome. Fresh. Crispy. Perfectly salty. 

My friend ordered the cheesy scrambled eggs with bacon/potato roasti.  Regret! I had meal envy as soon as it arrived.

I don't know about you, but when I think of cappuccinos, I picture an obnoxiously oversized bowl-like cup. The Gilead cappuccino is served in a tiny mug - seriously, about half the size of a mug you get if you order drip coffee. A little disappointing.

Overall, Gilead is a beautiful space for brunch, service is good, as is the food. I'd stick to the drip coffee next time around."}
{"text":"I went to Gilead Cafe with a friend to check out their new spring menu.  Walking in to Gilead, I felt welcomed and excited to try out their menu.

Their menu is meant for sharing, all items can be shared among a group of friends.  I love the poutine, it was covered in pulled pork with chucks of melty cheese; absolutely delish.  The burger was divine, it was served on an in-house made bread bun.  We finished the meal with JK Fries; one of the best fries I have had in the city.

Service was great!

I will definitely be back for future meals."}
{"text":"A charming little place with its own perfect flaws.

I've had several visits to Giliad for lunches, breakfast or a quick snack and the space draws me in - has a bright, sunny vibe. Extremely casual for its clean look. One immediately gets the sense the Café and Bistro is about enjoyment, and making occasion to just slow down a gear and reconnect.

The burger has been a frequent choice, and reliable standbys like that and I've also ordered a fair number of the ever-changing specials. Some were very enjoyable one-offs, while a few others came across less fulfilling than hoped - as if I'd not ordered enough tasty sidekicks or substance to complete the picture. It's still fun rolling the dice. Giliad's not afraid to experiment and do whatever they want to, which defines working for one's love.

Some days I'm content to gnaw a superior pastry and a coffee (with the free refill) and bask near a sunny window, a quiet respite from the hammering keyboards and fluorescent glare of the corporate.

If you seek a consistently full stomach (or a meagre tally - or particularly both at once) GC may just not be your thing. But by Toronto standards Gilead stands out as different and has a thing about it I just like.

3.75 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"I was there for Sunday brunch with a friend, and we both ordered the eggs benedict with ham. For the premium price and JKs name on the cafe I expected something very authentic and flavourful...wrong! This was without a doubt the worst EB we've ever had. The hollandaise sauce had zero flavour along with the bland egg and ham. It was just really surprising how the entire meal had absolutely no taste.. wow!
I'm assuming this location is catered towards vegetarians and maybe missing something  in the ingredients used but I'm not sure. Anyhow, the prices are over inflated and the experience was disappointing. I won't be back even though I live across the street."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Gilead with three friends and had a great evening there. The food was delicious, the service was good, and I loved the decor and homey feel of the place.

Between four of us we split something like ten dishes and they were all very good. The dishes were all somewhat classic or \"typical\" dishes but the best way to describe the food is upgraded comfort food.  For instance, the poutine was still fries, gravy, cheese curds, and meat.  But it was really fresh fries, cheese, non-greasy gravy, and deliciously seasoned and tender meat.  The dessert was ice cream sandwiches, but on delicious like no-other (I'm assuming fresh-baked) cookies with premium ice cream, or apple pie but in the form of a deep-fried perogie-shaped pastry.  The main entrees were not quite as inventive as the desserts, but they were all cooked spot-on and tasted delicious and fresh.

The only thing is, you pay for what you get, and you pay extra for freshness. Three courses of dinner plus a glass of wine rang up to $65 including tax and tip. I'd say expect to spend about $50 - $75 on average for dinner."}

{"text":"food was definitely great, service was sub par (inattentive)"}
{"text":"I have torn feelings about this place. I really do like it, but standing outside in the cold for 30 min waiting to get inside is not my idea of fun.  There was a menu outside so I was able to pick what I wanted before I sat down. My bf and I decided to share the eggs benny (sub smoked salmon instead of pork) and french toast....turns out they don't have smoked salmon which through off my whole game. The food was quite nice but it loses a point for no smoked salmon and the brutal line.


On a side note... something that really grinds my gears
Knowing that there is a huge line up literally out the door and around the corner. DON'T LINGER.... while I was waiting for my table there was a women who was given her cc slip. I was then seated, served and half way through my meal when she finally signed her slip and left... how rude... really grinds my gears."}
{"text":"Delightful.  What you ask?  Why everything.  This comfortable, bright, hidden gem is tucked away in a little alley off King and Parliament.  It's Jamie Kennedy, so it's simple, local, and delicious.  From the moment you walk in it feels like you've left the gritty city as you take a seat at one of the wood-topped tables.  The walls are adorned with jars of pickled vegetables and there are fresh flowers along the windowsill.  It's always in the details.  


In the company of good friends I stopped in for Sunday brunch.  And tickle me pink, Gilead was offering one of Jamie's trademark specialties - POUTINE.  Fries and gravy with pulled pork?  Hell ya.  My enthusiasm is a reflection of the fact it isn't usually available on Sunday. Sadly though, they ran out of pastries.  Our waiter thought it'd be okay to give us bread instead (hey waiter, that's not okay unless it's on the house).  But again, I had just ordered bacon rosti and scrambled eggs with a side of POUTINE so nothing was bringing me down.  





I would recommend the eggs benedict if one of the daily specials doesn't jump out at you.  Jamie's hollandaise sauce is really one of the best I've had.  


Delightful."}
{"text":"Gilead cafe is a pleasant surprise tucked in an alley around the corner from another pleasant surprise, Morning Glory. I'm envious that this neighbourhood has such a lovely cafe in close proximity where they can drop in for espresso and pastries in the morning and return for yummy savouries at lunch. My braised beef poutine (you know I had to try it!) was perfect. light crispy fries, sumptuous braised beef, the perfect amount of cheese curds and a serving size that was satisfying without making me feel I had made an irresponsible and possibly life-threatening menu choice.

But the demeanour of the staff makes me wonder about labour practices. Why so glum chums? I seriously felt like I should get out of there so they could stop having to deal with people. Maybe this nighttime expansion has them working triple shifts?Maybe they save the smiles for the guys in suits and can't be bothered with a couple of women who don't look like money.  I don't know what's going on, but I hope it isn't serious and only temporary.

Because aside from that bit of distraction, it seems like it could all be quite lovely. Someone should upload a picture of the interior - it's definitely a big part of the charm."}
{"text":"It pains me to give any restaurant that serves such yummy food a less than stellar review, but the servers are just so darn indifferent that I can't muster up more than 3 stars.  The servers seem harried and almost annoyed - you kind of get the impression that, despite the lovely care put into the food, they just aren't very happy.  And that makes for a mediocre experience.

My friend and I went for brunch today and waited in line for a table.  The wait at the door wasn't too bad, but once we were seated, it took about 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us.  When we finally got the menu, we found it hard to decipher.  What, exactly, were \"Egg Hoppers\"?  Or a dish called \"Howdy Pardner\"?  It felt a little pretentious to us - and we're both joyful foodies who enjoy a little food pretension from time to time.  But why make the servers have to explain all the dishes?  Just put the item descriptions on the menu to avoid the hassle.  

The food, when it arrived, was delicious.  Bacon Rosti with Cheesy scrambled eggs was very salty but packed full of flavour - shredded potato and caramelized, chewy pieces of pancetta-like bacon, all threaded with onion and topped with lightly scrambled, creamy eggs.  The rosti could have been a little more crisp, and the dish might have had one cold or crisp component, but otherwise - breakfast perfection.  An Egg Hopper, it turns out, is delicate eggs (not sure if they were baked or fried?) with gooey yolks, over a sri laken coconut pancake that tasted like a more delicate version of Ethiopian injera with slightly sour notes and some lovely chile heat.  That dish was amazingly good - score one for the vegetarians!  Sides of bacon and sausage (okay - I went super carnivore today when it's all sourced locally) were also awesome.  Crisp, caramelized edges of pea-meal bacon with hints of mustard on the crust and velvety, complex sausages that were sweet and aromatic.  

Jamie - get your staff a vacation or a talking to so that we can enjoy your great food.  

Vegetarian score = 5/10.  This is a place for meat eaters, but the veggie options (few as they are) are just as delicious."}
{"text":"Somebody hand me a bib, 'cause I'm still drooling over this place.

Waterworks aside, everything that my group had was drool-worthy, from the cod \"cake\" amuse bouche through the lamb chops, pork belly & blood sausage, short ribs and schnitzel.

And standing out in the crowd were the lamb chops and the pork plate. The former were perfectly medium-rare and overflowing with flavour beyond the lamb while the latter was in lock step with Nota Bene's boudin noir and suckling pig. 

The service was perfectly-timed and our server handled all of our questions like a pro. 

I'll be dreaming of a pork belly Christmas this year."}
{"text":"The best little cafe tucked away on an alleyway with innovative architecture.
I love this place- pricier than your acerage place- you won't feel like you are ever being ripped off (although if you're looking for more quantity without sacrificing too much quality I would go to morning glory nearby)

Gileads is on the top 10 of breakfasts in Toronto (used to be top 5 but so many nw places have opened int he last few years and well... Gileads can be a pain to get to because it is likely going to be a dedicated stop- there isnt' much nearby cept for Toronto's version of nature).

{"text":"I will admit, I hadn't heard of Jamie Kennedy.
Blasphemy, I know. 
Anyway, once I was told he was a 'celebrity chef' I got quite scared and was only willing to go when someone else was paying ;-)

I kinda wish I had used that card on a more expensive restaurant because what I expected to be outrageously expensive turned out to be quite average. 

Between $10-$15 per person. 
I had a fancy salad, my coworker had the cheeseburger and my other coworker had the cottage pie. We all shared fries, too. 
What was nice was that the meals weren't insanely fancy but it was really in the details. My salad had little I don't know what but thingies that were delicious, the cottage pie had beets and another veggie I can't remember cut up next to the plate to make it look lovely and the fries didn't come with ketchup but rather, mayo and some spicy hoisen mayo sauce. 

The ambiance was very nice, as well, and though I wouldn't have recognized him had he not been pointed out to me, it still felt neat to be served by a 'celebrity'!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in an obscure alleyway between King and Eastern is this little jewel of a restaurant. I would venture to say it's one of the best lunch spots in the city, thanks to Jamie Kenney's brilliant take on yummy, satisfying, slow food.  Everything here is top-notch quality. It might seem expensive for what you get (sometimes), but after you try the peameal bacon sandwich or the cheese, meat and grainy mustard-laden ploughman's plate you'll recognize why it comes at a premium. SO GOOD.

But what makes me come back time and time again (other than the amazing coffee--which I buy by the pound now) is the mind-blowing daily poutine. There is some sort of potato artist/angel in their kitchen, because Gilead Café's fries are heaven sent--crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. All of the specials are amazing, but I usually hold out for the BBQ pulled pork poutine. I can't find words to describe this stuff, but I will say one thing: I've been sampling this elusive Canadian specialty since I was a wee thing, and Gilead Café's Southern-meets-Northern fusion version comes close to the best of the best."}
{"text":"My week of living off coupons continues... With fellow Yelp Elite Karl R. in tow, we went downtown to the Gilead Café and Bistro on a sunny Sunday afternoon for some summer brunchin'.   The voucher was good for $30.

Upon arriving at around 12:30PM, there was a wait list.  We only waited about 20 minutes and nabbed a seat by the bar.  I sometimes prefer sitting at the bar as the bar usually allows you to glimpse into the kitchen where all the hard work is done.

We were ignored for a good 10 minutes until the server said with a smile \"Oh I had forgotten that you weren't waiting for a table at the bar and that you were actually seated here.\"  I'm sorry, but, you do not get points for honesty in this case!  She then offered us coffee or tea for which we both opted for coffee.

The coffee was meh. I've had much better coffee at other brunch establishments.  We opted for:

Chef's Salad - Artisan lettuce with what I'm guessing was gruyere because it wasn't mild like mozzarella, raddishes as well as deli roast beef strips.  It was drizzled with a house honey mustard vinaigrette. There was ONE random edible flower in there... Maybe for presentation?  In terms of a salad, this was not up to par in terms of a restaurant-made salad. A 4 year-old could've prepared this salad and you wouldn't have known otherwise. There wasn't much going on neither from a flavor nor textural perspective.

I also ordered the yogurt with granola and honey which had apricots in it.  The granola was not oily and provided a nice crunch to an otherwise soft yogurt. The honey provided a bit of sweetness to an otherwise bland yogurt.  This is something I could've whipped up at home and was again nothing special but at least it was better than the amateur salad.

Karl lamented about his Eggs Benny that they charged $13 for an Egg McMuffin. It was a rather lonely Eggs Benny - not even home fries or a side salad. Just 2 eggs on an English muffin. From a visual perspective, the Hollandaise sauce did not have its usual glossy sheen and clung to the poached eggs like a film of goop. It had a nice brown colour to it. I cannot comment on it from a taste perspective.

Since Karl's dish came with no sides we ordered a side of fries. After what seemed like an eternity, the fries finally came. They were thin cut fries seasoned in salt and thyme. These were probably the highlight of brunch as they were surprisingly tasty. 

At the end of the day the bill came to $45.20 less our $30 coupon for a total payable of $15.20. Considering what we got I would say that this restaurant survives solely because of a celebrity chef's name attached to it.  Ironically, I have never heard of Jamie Kennedy.... Jamie Oliver on the other hand... There are plenty of awesome brunch places in Toronto... You need not waste your time coming here.  I can't help but crack a reference to the Republic of Gilead from Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale... This Gilead might not be as repressive, but its definitely gloomy..."}

{"text":"edifying Ontario-centric wine list; well-crafted local tapas-sized dishes (wildly varied flavors on the cheese platter; fried cornish hen; poutine; delectable little fried fruit pies); sweet table service, if a bit uneven; could do without the chef fawning over the celebrity (yeah, the one who brought not only his own French wine, but his own wine glasses) and paying not a discernable whit of attention to the rest of his diners; cool neighborhood space"}
{"text":"I have a place in my heart for Gilead Cafe and Bistro because this is where my boyfriend took me for our first semi-date lunch! We both ordered a warm quinoa salad with poached egg - it was surprisingly filling and very delicious! We also filled up on wine that day; I can't remember what it was now, but the waiter was awesome and gave us the remainders of the bottle so we were quite buzzed after lunch. The space is great; I love how they line the shelves with things in mason jars. This is exactly what I\"d want my bistro to look like if I had one! 

My boyfriend obviously made a great impression on me that day (as did his choice of restaurant!), because we are still together one year later...!"}
{"text":"Gilead Cafe is most certainly a little gem of Corktown. Came here this afternoon (Sunday) for some grub with a good friend.

Reservation-less, we anticipated a long wait. The host was quite friendly and seated us at the bar while we waited an entire ten minutes for a table. At the bar, we were able to see all the delicious looking desserts, ranging from biscotti to cookies to cakes.

I ordered the 'Fried Eggs and Boris' Breakfast Sausages w/ J.K's Fries.' It was gooooooood. I usually never eat sausages because they're greasy, but these sausages were delish. J.K's fries are also really tasty. They have herbs on them.

I'll be back! Would love to check out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing meal here. The flavours were so amazing, unique, and fresh tasting. It was one of my best dining experiences in Toronto!

Here is a run down:

1. Atmosphere: Casual. You dont need a dinner jacket. Its hidden away on a quiet street and when you enter the restaurant, you are surprised to see it packed. There is a comfortable feel to the place with wooden tables and menus chalked out on large blackboards. 

2. Food. So Delicious. We had the summer fresh salad-the dressing is AMAZING, and fries with two sauces for appetizers. I would say the serving sizes are a little on the small side, but honestly the quality of the food far outweighs the amount. Our mains were Nicoise salad with whitefish.  They had prepared the whitefish in a way that it was served cold...I lack the culinary knowledge to describe exactly what they did to it, but it was flaky and soft and delicious. The other main was salmon on bed of rice. Soft, borderline chewy rice (but not in a bad way) mixed with cranberries, truly amazing combination of flavours. And I believe it was wild salmon, just amazing fresh flavours that stood out on their own.

3. Service: terrific! We had a friendly waiter who was attentive and knowledgable regarding the menu. As well, we let our waiter know we needed to be out of there by a certain time, and she was great getting our meals and our bill to us well before we needed to leave.

For true foodie lovers, go here. I'd love to go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Ok Greg C. this one's for you!   I could wait no longer to meet up to finally check out the Gilead to discover for ourselves if the guru of the local food movement still had his mojo working.  I know that Chef Kennedy has had a few ups and downs over the past couple of years, perhaps expanding way too quickly and effectively watering down his personal trademark that garnered his reputation.  

I believe that that Gilead has really become the sanctuary that JK has turned to refocus on what made his brand so damn good in the first place.  He, much like chefs such as Mark McEwan, David Adjey, Roger Mooking. and the king of them, Susur, become larger than life when flooded by the corporate greed of backers who want to ride their culinary coat tails. I'm quite sure it's not easy to resist that lure but when they fall, they fall hard. 

Jamie Kennedy cleared the dishes off my table all three times I have dined at the Gilead.  He seems so much more relaxed than the Jamie Kennedy I met at the Gardiner one afternoon.  He cooks.  He waits tables. He works side by side with his staff and you can see this all unfolding in front of the patrons who dine here.  It is almost impossible not to feel the food vibe wafting out of the kitchen.  I think what has really happened is that by going back, up close and personal to the people, when they get fed by Chef Kennedy and he picks up their plates, they in turn, feed him.  The human condition of food that transpires between the creator and recipient is transcendental, ultimately becoming the X factor in Chef Kennedy finding his food legs once again.  We are all the better for it. 

I think what we are seeing here is something I refer to as the \"counter connectivity\".  In the old days, in cafes & diners, we'd sit up at the counter, the cook would be in front of us or at the very least in our sight line.  Their passion to cook was fed by the up close reactions of us sitting up at their counter, eating their food, feeling satisfied and sharing those feelings.  

The Gilead menu is basic, seasonal, driven by what can sourced locally and ethically.  I've tried most of the things on the chalkboard menu.  I've been here both in the daytime and in the evening.  There isn't any pretentiousness here in this cafe.  The staff are friendly.  The dinner menu is small, hand written then copied for the tables.  Daytime service is walk up, order, sit down then delivered.  Dinner service, which starts at 5:30 p.m. is all table service.  

My food highlights have included a Pulled Lamb Poutine with Montforte Dairy curds and a lamb jus.  Double smoked Berkshire bacon sandwich on thinly sliced bread and salad with Soiled Reputation greens and scapes.  I'm fairly certain I could eat in this little cafe daily and never tire of its menu or of the comfort it has afforded on some very hectic days of my life.  The fries are as good as ever and yes, the spuds are grown on the Kennedy farm.  

I like the Gilead.  This is a place that I would comfortably dine all by myself and that, in of itself, speaks volumes."}
{"text":"After waiting about 30 minutes for a plate of french fries. Yes. Something McDonald's can crank out in 4 min 38 sec:

Me: [disgusted] You'd think something run by Jamie Oliver would be better run.

Y: I think it's Jamie Kennedy. Not Jamie Oliver. Though I'm not sure the difference.

Me: I guess now that I think of it Jamie Oliver would not have fries on the menu.

We still don't know who Jamie Kennedy is and we care less after Gilead. Service was slow. Maybe it's because we decided to be bohemian and take our brunch at the bar. The bar seems to imply you're happy to wait for absolutely everything, from initial service to  your food. Don't do it.

I had the eggs benny. $13. No sides. Just a small plate of 2 poached eggs on bread and sauce. $13. 

Y: You want something else?

Me: I was thinking of getting fries. You would think for $13 they could throw a few home fries on the plate for effect.

The eggs benny were okay. Had better. Hell, I would have been more satisifed with two egg mcmuffins for half the price. Other than some ephemeral quality that this food has had Jamie Kennedy wave his cudgel over, it was so not worth $13. 

The fries were pretty darn good, mind you. $13 for egg benny and a side of those puppies would have been nice. 

Luckily we had a groupon deal. You're supposed to tip on the whole bill before the discount but we tipped on the final tally. Service was so not worth it."}
{"text":"My friends and I trekked out to Corktown to grab brunch at Morning Glory, only to discover it was closed. This worked out well in the end, as we walked down a laneway and ended up at Gilead Cafe instead. This is yet another Jamie Kennedy restaurant. Like his other ventures, this place is excellent. Despite being in a pretty unassuming light-industrial building, the interior of the restaurant is really nice. They did a great job decorating the space, and it has a lot of character. The food is delicious. My friends and I had the poutine, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a spring salad, and all of the dishes were quite good. (Kennedy knows how to make fries, and the poutine was really something else.) This place is definitely worth checking out again."}
{"text":"I came for Sunday brunch with my parents and it was delicious! We had their fresh drip coffee. My only complaint here is they don't serve soy milk. I ordered the daily hash special, my dad the braised beef poutine and my mum poached eggs, side salad and a side of fries with their house aioli. Overall great! Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"All local and seasonal Canadian fare, not to be confused with Gilead Cafe which is the daytime lunch establishment. Apparently their products come from places like Dingo Farms, Soiled Reputation, The New Farm, Stoddard Farm and Akiwenzie Fisherman. 

Well, since the menu changes all the time, I can't remember exactly what we ordered. I know that there were two asparagus specials, a white and green grilled asparagus with a mustard sauce and crispy shallots, and a white/green asparagus soup with creme fraiche. Both were reallllyyy good. Then we also started with the gratin of agria potato, which was the most home-style part of the dinner for sure. 

Oh, before anything came out, Jamie Kennedy (nope, not the \"comedian\"/Jennifer Love Hewitt's \"man\") brought out an amuse bouche: a polenta croquette with, I think, a beet sauce and some flowers. It was delicious. 

Our main courses consisted of a stuffed chicken, roasted lamb, braised short rib, steak frites, and pickorel. All were really good, but surprisingly I think the chicken was the best one. 

I feel like the best way to experience a city is to go to a restaurant like this to try what that area has to offer. Everything is local, everything is fresh, and even most of the best restaurants in the city can't offer that. It was reasonably priced and I would bet if this same place was in LA it would easily be twice as much."}
{"text":"Excellent despite the occasional hiccup. I've enjoyed the daily sandwich many times (Pork loin, Pulled pork, Smoked turkey etc.) The poutine is always great. If you can't wait 10 min for the best bowl of soup you will probably ever have than you'd probably be better off at Tim Hortons, I hear they serve soup too...So, take out or sit for a bit, read the paper, enjoy a coffee (OK, but not stellar) or the excellent daily puree of fruit and sparkling water (Pear, Peach were both good). If you're lucky you might get a homebrewed birch beer."}
{"text":"Great, affordable and interesting food makes for a good meal."}
{"text":"Went with a small group for dinner and shared numerous small plates with meats, fishes, salads, and dessert, along with some of the suggested wine pairings. Everything was truly delicious, including miso-glazed black cod, JK fries with two sauces, stewed beef, a great pork dish, a three-beet salad, and a galantine of chicken and mushrooms. Wonderful warm chocolate cake with berry sauce to finish. The space is very cozy. It's tucked away into an alley, making you feel you've stumbled upon a great secret. The only negative was that our server seemed stressed out. His spiel was too long, and he tried way too hard to direct us to particular dishes, interrupting so frequently and making so many suggestions that it began to really get in the way of our group's conversation. He dropped some cutlery more than once in his haste to whisk away our dishes and generally seemed overly anxious. I'd prefer less intrusive, smoother, more relaxed service. Still, I liked this place a lot."}
{"text":"This place reminds me what Sunday brunch should be -- relaxing, quiet, and delicious. It is refreshing to come here on a weekend and not have to worry about massive lines. The place was busy, but as long as you aren't coming with a huge party, you should be able to get a table no problem without reservations. 

It's tucked away just off King West (turn right into the alleyway in front of Morning Glory -- which also looks super-cute, will have to try that place next, although just from looking in the window, Morning Glory has a lot less seating space). There is some free parking in the back.

The menu is short, with several specials (tarte, omelette, entree). I had a glass of the JK juice (freshly squeeze sweet plum juice -- something different and very tasty) and a latte. As mentioned in another review, the cappuccinos come is pretty small cups. But my latte came in a fairly large mug. 

My DC and I got the breakfast pastries. It's $5/pp and I don't know if they would let you share... because actually one plate would've probably been enough for both of us. You get a small croissant, deliciously buttery scone with raisins, 2 pieces of warm bread, and another 2 pieces of a sweeter, almost cake-like loaf. They were all lovely and served with a tangy berry jam and creme fraiche. If you want a lighter brunch, the pastries and a latte alone would be perfect. 

I also had the omelette of the day, which had potatoes, spinach, and aged cheddar. Great combo with just a hint of spiciness in the sauce around the potatoes. It came with a side salad -- boston lettuce and a fresh lemon-y dill dressing. The DC had the fried eggs and Boris breakfast sausages, which are served on top of a huge pile of JK's signature fries. Looked amazing. 

Service was polite and unhurried. The space is warm and inviting, like JK's other restaurants. The walls are covered in jars of preserves. All in all, an enjoyable weekend brunch experience without all the \"hype\" of some other places."}
{"text":"I have worked in the area for a few years now and have made a significant effort to like this establishment as I do like local grown food and it is so convenient in proximity. 

That being said, especially recently the service is ATROCIOUS... I waited for over 12 min while all manor of staff walked by me without so much as a glance. $9.00 for Cauliflower puree soup?  Really?!
The prices are high even considering the area but the food and menu is extremely inconsistant making it all the more audacious.
Again as it is so close I wanted to utilize this cafe for \"something\" so I gave the coffee and barista beverages a go but to no avail even they were unimpressive to say the least and the self serve coffee station I found a cheap substitute for their already poor service.
Then you consider the concept that there is zero parking rendering this place useless unless you are within walking distance as there is absolutely NOTHING worthy of drawing anyone from any lengthy distance.

The only thing I did enjoy here consistantly were the \"organic\" french fries and dip but they were fairly over priced and came with a dollop of dip, literallly... tiny! 
Everything about this place, including the sea of bottled vegatables displayed on the walls sort of weirds me out and the high prices really turn the stomach especially considering the entrance of the establishment is located in an alley. Just saying"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch last Sunday, and our group of four waltzed right in and had our pick of tables - it was a late brunch.  

The caffeine was good and strong, the poutine salty and indulgent, the pastries were the best spin on a brunch bread basket I've had in recent memory, and the hash special with beets and whitefish so gooey and good my mouth is watering right now at the memory.  

I loved the atmosphere, and will definitely be adding Gilead Cafe to the brunch rotation."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Atmosphere was nice and was a good spot for a 'date night'. The bread was worth ordering but as much as I wanted to enjoy it, the rest of the meal was disappointing.  We shared an eggplant garlic soup that tasted mostly of tomatoes (roasted tomatoes were a garnish in the soup).  The short rib poutine was tasty although pretty salty. Normally I would have complained but was in a salty mood that night so enjoyed the additional sodium intake. We also shared halibut and that was the biggest disappointment of all. Flavours of the Swiss chard and sauce were good but the fish was very over cooked. So much so we couldn't finish it. We could have made a bigger deal about it but had been told before we were seated that our table was needed for a 7:30 reservation so cut our losses and left.  At least we enjoyed each other's company."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at a JK restaurant before and was excited to try one today. I didn't even realize there was one 5 minutes from my office! 

The decor was nice enough, very modern, I felt more like I was in New York than Corktown, but the service was horrible. My friend was brought the wrong bowl of soup and had to wait 10 minutes after they brought me my food to get the right one, but only after reminding them 3 times she was still waiting. They also forgot to bring us our drinks until we went back up to the counter to tell them after waiting for 15 minutes. This turned what was supposed to be a quick, but stylish and tasty lunch into an hour-long debacle. 

Get your shit together, Gilead."}
{"text":"I asked a girl friend to meet me there for brunch.  The space is bright and hip, and casual at the same time. The menu choices were very interesting and we had a hard time choosing. We finally decided on a smoked salmon and Pancake, and a lobster hash.
Sigh... Oh Gilead, how I wish I liked your food.  The pancake was completely tasteless, the smoked salmon, which was actually a smoked dry-ish fillet, didn't really help. It was like dry on dry and both were bland. The lobster hash was okay, with miniscule bits of lobster that made me feel bad for taking more than two pieces, in case my friend didn't get any.  The service was utilitarian... it did the job, but with a sliver of hipster pretentiousness.  The experience made me actually apologize to my friend for picking the place and I said she'll definitely get to pick a place next time.  
I've been back to Gilead since to pick up a pastry here or there and it's fine.  I wouldn't mind trying a back door burger at some point, and hopefully, it'll be good enough to redeem the JK name for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and had the best pickeral fish and chips ever! Boy, have I missed JK. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Service was a touch slow at first (30 mins for a glass of wine), but as soon as they realized the slow service everything was amazing the rest of the evening. Great waitstaff. Food was fantastic. Highly recommend the cabbage roll and chicken galantine... And of course the fries ;)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I went to an event they catered and tried the smoked white fish and had to go back! The catering though, was much more impressive than the café, which is a shame. All the same, it was still very delicious. I liked it very much. Some pretty decent teas. They had pickled things like beats, vegetables, etc. along the walls, which added a splash of colours. The baked goods and desserts were quite good too. I'll definitely go back when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"got here after 230p, so we couldn't order from the a la carte menu. that said, i really enjoyed the yogurt and granola and my ontario vegetable salad. my friend loved his ham and cheese croissant, and i had a bite, and i must say it was very tasty.

that said, for the prices, nothing blew me away. the cookie we had was downright mediocre. 

service was very friendly, if a tad confusing. the decor was so cute! i love the pickled jar wall. we wondered if they make use of all the stuff on that wall, and shuffle in new jars.

i'll return some day before 230p and try the a la carte menu. if that shines (which it sounds like it will) then i can see making this a 5 star"}
{"text":"This place is totally overrated and expensive (for what you get).
I ordered the Poutine and thought it was just ok.  The braised beef was good but it just was not a poutin anymore...Not that I am by any means a poutine connoisseur.  I'm just a Cali girl who loves the taste of the squeaky cheese curds.  
I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Gilead Cafe has been on my 'hit list' since their doors opened in an alleyway off King Street.  If you blink you might miss it, which I'm sure is one of the reasons why it never comes to mind.
 
The other week, my cousin Natasha and I were scoping out dinner options.  I flipped through my pile of Groupons for inspiration and then I saw it...my $30 coupon for Gilead Cafe.  Decision was made and I was counting down the minutes until our reservation.
  
THE MENU:
 
Jamie Kennedy, the well-respected chef and owner of Gilead, is my hero.   Not only because he's easy on the eyes and looks handsome in his chef coat.  I also admire that he sets the bar high when it comes to his food.  For instance, Gilead's menu changes with the seasons to ensure you and I are only getting the best ingredients sourced close to home.  Just a few of the producers he relies on are Dingo Farms, Soiled Reputation, and Stoddart Farm (as stated on Stoddart's site, \"our animals are not on drugs...just grass\").
 
The menu is what I would describe as comfort food that challenges the status quo.  Instead of \"fish and chips\", you will see \"tempura halibut\".   Instead of a \"ham and cheese sandwich\", you'll find \"porchetta and wild leek sandwiches\".  All of the unexpected ingredient combinations on the menu makes you go hmm.   The anticipation for your meal is intensified, coupling hunger with curiousity as you wonder what the heck you just ordered!
 
The menu has a blend of shared and entree-type dishes ranging from $6 (for fries) to $18 (for steak frites).  Their latest menu is posted here.
 
The wine list was a good size.  The bonus was the option to order a 3 ounce OR 6 ounce glass.  So if you're a lightweight (or the designated driver) you can have a glass and not have to worry about blowing over the limit.  I did enjoy the wine, but that's not why I took the photo below.  Look yonder and you will see a gentleman standing in a white chef coat.  Yeppers!  That's my hero, JK!

OUR ORDER:
 
Let me caveat that this night was my 'cheat' night, and I took cheating to another level!  In fairness, items OK'd by the Paleo Diet were few and far between.  You name it, I had it:  cheese (dairy), couscous (grains), sugar (dessert).  Let's just say that the Paleo gods were not impressed.
 
The highlight of the night came early...when Jamie Kennedy himself served us our main dishes!   Is this the norm?  I wanted to say something, like \"can I get your autograph\" or \"you're my hero\" but my cousin (who had no clue who he was) blurted out \"Um, that dish is not mine\" when Jamie set my meal in front of her my mistake.  I let out a nervous giggle trying ease the awkwardness as he switched plates.  That was our first and last visit from JK that evening.
 
JK Poutine - Beef brisket with cheddar ($11) - I did my research beforehand and knew that the poutine was highly recommended.  The  waitress also mentioned that it was the most popular dish, so this was a no-brainer.   The fries were fantastic (an 8/10).  Slightly crispy with a little salt, topped with a hunk of tender shredded beef and shredded cheese.  It was the cheese that won my heart.   I learned that it was unpasturized, aged white cheddar from PEI.  God bless PEI for making such beautiful cheese.  And god bless Jaime for bringing it to us.
 
So that was my review.   The people I was dining with on the other hand, were more critical rating it from 5/10 to 7/10.   In fairness to Jaime, they were comparing it to traditional poutine, swimming in gravy and some mystery cheese.  This is not your average poutine.

For the rest of this review, check out my blog post."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this cafe by accident, not realizing it was part of the Jamie Kennedy family.  Amazing food!  The roast beef sandwich and french fries are highly recommended.  Tarts in the summertime are also amazing... actually I'm not sure what I've had here that wasn't amazing for that matter! 

The portions look small but end up being the right amount for a meal.  It can be hard sometimes getting a table here and they don't take reservations.  And prices are a bit high for what you're getting - but I suppose that's what you get when you add the JK name to things!  

Staff here are variable - nice about 90% of the time."}
{"text":"This is the latest Jamie Kennedy hotspot. It's down an unassuming alley in Corktown, and is beautifully decorated-- huge industrial windows, wooden beams and off-centre hanging light fixtures. Basically, it's decorated like that loft in Soho we all wish we could afford. 

I had their poutine of the day, which was duck and green onions plus the normal poutine fare. Jamie himself was in the kitchen making mains on this day, so that was pretty cool. I love a celebrity chef. My friend had the cobb salad, which unfortunately was mainly chicken. Like, more chicken than salad. Funnily enough the woman made a remark when we were paying (you order and pay from the counter, but they bring you your food) for our food at the end that they ring the cobb salad in under chicken, which is fair, but, like whyyyy so much chicken? Why not just call it chicken with bacon and lettuce. Regardless of the over-birding of the salad, the dressing was pretty darn tasty.

I'm looking forward to coming back for brunch, their menu looks fantastic. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their namesake sparkling water. Refreshing and a classy touch.

NB: They're not open in the evenings unless it's for a private event."}
{"text":"The server was very unwelcoming to our group of five. The moment we arrived he was super rude to us trying to drive us away from eating here. Our group hadn't all arrived and it's fair that he can't seat us all until we've all arrived but it was the condescending attitude of how he presented that to us that really ticked me off. While waiting we decided to just order a coffee and he seemed even upset and unwilling to make the coffee for us. Even when preparing our coffee at the milk and sugar station it felt like we were in his way, the way he said \"Excuse me!\" to get the menus which were next to the coffee station. And the last straw was when we had to wait in the standing area and he told us we couldn't stand here as it blocks the area for his servers. Ok fine. Again fair enough but the rest of the doorway was packed with guests so where do we stand? I guess we'll just stand outside in the cold like the guests you clearly don't want eating here. Sorry for troubling your day. The coffee wasn't the greatest anyway."}
