{"text":"You simply must try this place out. From pasta, to sandwiches, and pizzas.. This place is really a 5-star restaurant in disguise. From presentation to flavour, it just cannot be beat. Steak sandwich is actually steak strips cooked to your liking. Mind blown. Plus you can tell that the ingredients they use are second to none. Get your fill quick before it gets too crowded, because it's one tv or article feature away from blowing up in the YYC food scene."}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab a quick bite on my way back to the office during lunch. Since Bottegas caters to the lunch crowd, there were no empty tables so I went for take out. I ordered the Venezia panini which, at $8.50 sounds a bit pricey, but I was very happy with the size and quality of the sandwich.  Provolone and Salami over roasted vegetables on a wonderful Italian bun. Really good. Pizzas and pasta dishes also look great.  The owners make a reasonable attempt to make customers forget they're in a commercial strip mall. It's a long narrow room so the decor is slightly hap hazard, but does create a first impression that authentic Italian comfort food is on the menu.  There is even a herb garden in the front window.  Although my order was take out, the counter  was very friendly and attentive. I could tell by the hustle of the staff that the tables were being looked after as well.   Happy that it's near by and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A rep took me out for lunch here. Neither of us had tried this little lunch spot and we're glad we did.  They have a great menu with diverse flavour options in their pizza, pasta, and panini portfolio. I went with their daily special which was rapini with a pesto-like sauce served over fresh pasta. Really tasty and nice an garlic-y. It also came with a slice of their fresh made focaccia. The bread was on the saltier side, but it provided a nice wake-up for my taste buds."}
