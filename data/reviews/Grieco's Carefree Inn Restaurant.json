{"text":"Tried out this resturant tonight and my meal was completely inedible! I ordered the chicken entree and it was literally swimming in olive oil! No flavor, and very disappointing. Plus, the couple next to us asked the chef if the potatoes were \"real\" or flakes and he admitted they were instant potatoes from a bag...wow. The service was slow, and our waitress never checked up on us at any time during our meal. When she did come to the table she would put the food down and fly away from the table. She left the folding tray out in front of our table the whole stay and was always at the bar talking with the bartender. Very strange behavior! The ONLY reason we gave her a tip was because the host was very nice to us. Needless to say, I'll never go back! I do not need to spend money or support an establishment that treats me like I'm bothering them!

Note: I'm not trying to hurt this business. My hope is they take these reviews and improve the quality of their servers, all of their menu choices, and the customers experience overall."}
{"text":"Best Italian, seafood, and beef in the Allegheny Valley! Been going there since it opened and try to get back at least once a month. Those who say different have no sense of meals prepared fresh to order."}
{"text":"This is a building that's basically a hole in the hillside but what a freakin gem!!!! I highly recommend calling ahead and setting a reservation as they get super busy. It's kind of an older crowd that's usually here but it is old school elegance and fine dining. I could see Ol' Blue Eyes himself in a joint like this. It is kind of pricey but my goodness is it worth it. Delicious start to finish. And who doesn't love bottomless fresh bread! This isn't somewhere we can afford to go a lot now but something we save for special nights like a nice date night out every now and again. I highly recommend checking out the deals they offer on restaurant.com. You can save some money going this way. I have had sandwiches here all delicious. Last time I got the regular cut of the certified black angus prime rib and it was melt in my mouth amazingly scrumptious! I am definitely looking forward to the next time we get to go back. I suggest dressing up a bit to go here. Nice polo or dress shirt and clean solid jeans or pants for sure. Don't go here looking like a bum or right out of the gym. This place is nice And it's worth it to feel good inside and out being there."}
{"text":"Classic Pittsburgh food.  Haven't been ere for about a decade until tonight.  The filet Oscar and crab cakes were great.Pecan balls with hot fudge for dessert.  A $15 bottle of Cabernet as a house win.  The outside might be getting a bit shabby, but the inside is warm and inviting and so is the staff."}
{"text":"I had an important dinner to coordinate (my parents meeting my fiancé' parents) and I knew that this would be the perfect location, having been here years ago. Greico's did not disappoint. The service was just as great as I remembered and the food was even better. I got the prime rib (king cut) it melted in my mouth with every bite, I ended up finishing the whole cut in one seating (not an easy feat for me). We ordered the cheese skewers and they were hand made delicious gooey cheese just as you would expect. Would've loved to tried the desserts but there was no more room. My fiancé got a New York strip steak and it was cooked to the perfect medium rare, she couldn't finish hers but took it home to enjoy it later. I will be going back to Greico's for my next formal/informal evening."}
{"text":"A solid four star establishment.  The food and service were very good.  The ambiance was okay, although a little dated. The prices were a tad high for most items, but they had some affordable dishes too.  I would reorder everything I had and would recommend a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good food nice location. Good service and good dessert!! Nice atmosphere. Parking is tight"}
{"text":"Top of the line Dinner! I had the prime rib and my wife had the salmon Oscar. Both work cooked and seasoned to perfection. The decor of the place could use a little updating, but if you're going for great food, this is the place to go to. Then only thing I will say is we had a very young blonde waitress who was very careless, never checked on our table to see if we needed refills or more bread. Then she hands me both plates instead of serving it to my wife instead. Was looking around at the older waitress and they seemed to be doing a superb job. I don't know if it's cause they have trouble finding good employees, but i feel that if I had a more experienced server, I wouldn't have a complaint about the place. Will change my review if I come in again and get At service to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was better than average, but for what it is, to charge $7 for a glass of wine and poor it by the ounce really takes away from the value.  It's not worth the prices."}
