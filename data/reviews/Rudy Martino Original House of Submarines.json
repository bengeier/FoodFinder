{"text":"Rudy's has the absolute best Italian and Cheese Steak hoagies this side of the Mississippi!  I've been a customer for 40+ years and the quality has never changed.  Very nice people. Even though I don't live as close i still make the drive for the best hoagie in the Burgh! Don't miss out on this one -   YOLO !!"}
{"text":"Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved and became a sub shop I got hooked on those wonderful cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.  Now to be clear, this is probably not a place your typical Yelper would like. There is no ambiance. No \"decor\". No table service. No boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is \"infused\". You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.  But if you want a delicious cheesesteak, I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else.   The two best hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  - Rudy's and the Triangle bar."}
{"text":"THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sub. I've ever had... Fresh bread, juicy meat... Great friendly service..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rudys for 25 years. Ever since I moved from Pittsburgh they are a must-go to place. The same family runs the shop and are ever so patient when a big group of us come in. The hot italian sub is my all time favorite. Ever. Ask them to add the works (including mayo). The philly chessesteak is my second go-to. The bread doesn't fall apart when eating it and the vegetables are cooked just right. I really wish we had one of these in South Carolina."}
{"text":"Everything here is the best. Mancinis bread is always fresh. I always kick myself when I eat a sandwich anywhere else when rudy's is open because you can't get any better. Everything on the menu will leave smiling, the employees are the greatest too. Cap and egg with mayo, I'm telling you."}
{"text":"I\"m a southerner, which doesn't qualify me as a born expert on cheese steak. But you don't need an advanced degree to know that this place puts out an absolutely delicious sandwich. I live 1100 miles away, but my first (and third, and fourth and fifth) stop when I go to Pittsburgh is always Rudy's. I usually avoid meat, cheese, and white carbs, but this definitely merits an exception.   I have tried everything and like most all of it, but always get the steak and cheese, with egg. We never even heard of that back home. Get the smaller one unless you're sharing. I have to take part of the small to go, its enormous.  I think they've been in the same place for 30 years and never heard about paint. Who cares what it looks like though, when its the best thing you ever put in your mouth?"}
