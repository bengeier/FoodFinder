{"text":"Sonny & Jo's is a must stop in the south of Pittsburgh (Banksville Road). Fantastic food and staff. It's a home town family owned restaurant and you can fell the good energy as soon as you walk in the door! Wings, Lasagna and salads are perfect. Tried the Hawaiian pizza and the Spinach, Tomato, Feta, Perfect! Can't wait to try the Calzones and the New York Style thin crust pizza. Soup was also Wonderful..... All and all it was a great experience from the phone in order, to pick up. Look forward to dining in."}
{"text":"Sonny and Jo's is truly a hidden treasure of Pittsburgh! This family-run restaurant and bar is a great place to catch a game, sit outside on a summer night while talking with friends, or just to see a familiar face (because if you come a couple of times they won't forget yours!) The atmosphere is that of a favorite neighborhood gathering place, and the food makes it even better.  The Sicilian-style pizza is something you have to try! I had one with sausage and green peppers the first time I ever came here, and it has kept me coming back. My favorite menu item, though, is the delicious calzone, best prepared when stuffed with Jo's amazing meatballs! (Watch out, though! The small calzone is enough for 2 people!) And as Sonny once told me about the pizza, \"You tell me how you want it and we can make it for you!\" They've really made an incredibly delicious menu, and they're always working to keep it that way.  As all bars go, they have traditional appetizers and \"game day\" snacks, but their wings are a big draw as well as the homemade chips (that are well worth ordering!) Make sure to check out the website for hours because they do change depending on the day--they're closed on Mondays. Also, the calendar tells you when wing night, happy hour, and ladies' night are.  I'm sure you'll see Sonny or Jo walking around and serving or chatting up their customers. They are such sweet people and their care for their neighbors and for this restaurant makes it the best place in the 'Burgh to eat!"}
{"text":"So good: wings are excellent, especially the Cajun. The fried bologna sandwich, amazing! Everything is good, people are nice."}
{"text":"I Ordered the  Buffalo Wings and they are good, A bit on the Salty side , But Good. I have not tried this Fig pizza , but maybe next time . They are a nice family owned place and the prices are very reasonable. Looks clean and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great family owned pizza shop/Italian eatery/bar!! Sonny and Jo themselves are always busy running around serving food and drinks and greeting their patrons like they are family! Their adult children also are actively involve with the business and the entire family is super friendly and very accommodating.  The menu is typical pizza, hoagies, wings, calzones, and some Italian specialties. Any item can be changed or customized to your liking though, so long as they have the ingredients you desire. I have tried many of the items on the menu and have never been disappointed. Thank you Sonny & Jo for always serving up the best."}
{"text":"Drive too fast down Banksville Road, and you'll miss an ordinary-looking establishment that hides one of the most singularly brilliant pizzas to ever slide out of an oven.  Let me introduce you to The Fabulous Fig, a pizza that if it were a person, would be offended that you have never heard of him...or her.   Figs, as a topping, were entirely unprecedented for me, they alone making the pizza mindblowing enough. Prosciutto, scallions, and that most ominously-monikered of Italian cheeses, Gorgonzola (it sounds like something that would challenge Godzilla!) only served to make it all the more legendary. The silvery platter it was served on turned a normal Friday pizza night into a grand event.   The Fabulous Fig's flavor is difficult to describe let alone fathom. Sweet and bitter collide, each battling for domination your taste buds while a Cali-thin, crispy, chewy crust intervenes in an attempt to let texture have a say. It is 10 inches in diameter and 20 feet tall in terms of palatableness.  Warning: I suspect this might not be a pizza for everyone due to its exotic, bizarre nature. Kay and I almost went with a traditional pizza, but were too fascinated by the prospect of the controversial Fabulous Fig to pass it up when we spotted it on the menu. Our daring choice left us with no regrets.   Readers, this is a real pizza, not a fig-ment of my imagination, pun halfway intended.   Our appetizer came in the form of provolone sticks, giving us a chance to sample Sonny & Jo's dynamite marinara sauce by way of those excellenty breaded and fried shafts of pungent, viscous cheese.   The rest of Sonny & Jo's menu is typical, casual Italian-American fare. You've got the wings, the burgers, the calzones, the salads, and of course the hoagies. The adjacent, relaxing dining room also has a full bar, and they'll even bring a pitcher of whatever beverage you want to your table like the Pizza Hut of old. I came in thinking that this would be yet another in-and-out pizza joint (they do deliver to a limited area) only to leave wondering how such a quiet, laid-back restaurant could exist along such a humming highway. Keep it thriving. Don't fly by; stop by.   P.S. When I mentioned to our gracious, motherly waitress that I was planning on writing a review, she brought us a couple of Potomac Bakery brownies on the house for dessert after we vanquished the Fabulous Fig, the Gorgeous George of pizzas."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Some families in the pizza shop and some fun people in the bar area.  Jo and the staff were working hard and stopped to say hello and treating you like family.  Had to have an the Buffalo Wings, Oh So Good! The pizza was tasty with a thick crust."}
