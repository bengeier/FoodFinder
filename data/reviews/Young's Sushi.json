{"text":"Such a great sushi place. Looks really unassuming, but was delicious. Cool family owned spot. Our waitress Halle was great! Favorite roll: the firecracker"}
{"text":"Young's sushi is by far one of the best restaurants in the area to get sushi. With the freshest ingredients, daily specials, and affordable prices you can't beat Young's. The decor is nothing exciting but the quality, quick service, and amazingly delicious rolls make up for the lack of distracting interior. I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have had No complaints!"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular sushi eater, but I must say that this has set my standards high.  This is a hole in the wall place, but had a very pleasant and relaxed atmosphere.  There is a tv on the wall where you can watch your meal, which is very nice and shows how freshly your food is being made.  The service was fabulous as my waitress was attentive and very pleasant.  Everyone was very friendly and the food came remarkably fast.   As an appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared the shrimp dumplings, which I would recommend.  As a main dinner, I got the Rainbow Roll and my boyfriend got the Las Vegas Roll.  The Rainbow Roll was good; very fresh tasting and natural.  The Las Vegas, on the other hand, had a kick to it and was less earthy. The Las Vegas was our personal favorit; the sauce was very good but not too spicy for me to handle (and I'm a baby with hot stuff!).  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a different, more quiet date.  The attire is casual and the overall environment is very pleasing for any type of occasion."}
{"text":"I have ate here twice now and can say that the sushi is good. I got 4 different rolls and a large Sapporo which was interesting. Definitely a good place to stop for your basic sushi at a decent price."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner, sushi was great!  We kept it simple with spicy tuna, white crab, Philadelphia rolls, etc.  They were all fresh and delicious.  We ordered five rolls and then took the server's suggestion for a sixth, the Love roll, which was also very tasty.  I'm a big fan of casual little places like this, and the closed circuit tv showing your sushi being made was a nice touch.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I just had to come edit my review for Young's from 4 stars to 5. The only thing that had kept me from giving it 5 stars before was that their portions were on the smaller side. I've gone for sushi every Friday for the past 4 weeks and every time we would comment on how the potions seem like they've gotten bigger lately.  The fish is always fresh, my rolls stay together when I pick them up, the rice is cooked well, our servers are always friendly and accurate and everyone loves the screen where you watch your sushi being made. I eat at Young's at least once a week and sometimes twice and have never gotten sick (I feel like that's important to mention when it comes to eating raw fish....)  I'm severely gluten intolerant and a lot of the special rolls come with tempura or some other kind of breading. I'm sure they'd be happy to leave them off if that's a concern of yours as well but I prefer not to risk it and only order things that don't include breading to avoid any mix-ups.  I've also ordered takeout many times and my order is still always correct and ready within 15 minutes.  Can't say enough good things about Young's, they really are the best around."}
{"text":"Great value. Neighborhood feeling. Clark Roll is my favorite. Some of the best sushi in Lake County. Off the main drag, free parking."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5?   Normally, I'd need a passport to go  this out of the way -- I rarely venture beyond the golden mandela of Shaker, Hunting Valley and Gates Mills. But, I had some paperwork to pick up at a title company in Mentor, and was famished.  Had a basic sushi bento -- all was OK. Probably should have gone with the bulgogi. Long wait -- the poor sushi chef was overwhelmed with a steady stream of people coming in for huge bags of carryout (who the hell orders sushi to go?)  While I don't mind a hole in the wall, it could use a good cleaning and paint job."}
{"text":"worst Japanese sushi ever. Maybe it's good for dine in but if you order takeout you get shit. Maybe because I called from an out of town number but THIS PLACE is the worst sushi place EVER! Sixty dollars wasted oh shit but I didn't want to be a dick head and return the food. BEWARE the takeout sushi looks nothing like the pictures left by other rewiews.   I've been to a lot of sushi places all over US and this is the crappiest of them all.   PS don't order their young sushi roll, it's supposed to be their signature roll.  The place seems to be run by Koreans and they are really cheap people."}
{"text":"Sushi was good and fresh! Bento box for lunch was perfect. I will come again! Situated in an unassuming strip of businesses, much like a convenience store. Great surprise."}
{"text":"Loooove Young's. Haven't had a bad experience yet. Get the spicy tuna roll, an order of potstickers and the miso soup! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner including the Bulgogi which was excellent. Definitely worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"Mr. Young was actually the awesome sushi chef at Lure, my favorite place to get sushi (and, I've had all the other sushi in town). He moved across the street from Lure and opened his own place. Don't let the exterior of the place fool you, or the fact that it's next to a convenience store. And, once you step inside, don't let the interior fool you - about ten tables and a boombox in the corner belting out everything from Whitesnake to Celine Dion.   You can't find a better deal for sushi anywhere, and it's top-notch! Their Combo Roll bento box is by far a steal for lunch, although you - unfortunately - don't get to choose your own rolls (can substitute, but they'll tack on an extra $2 per roll, not making it such the deal anymore). But, the california roll and spicy tuna rolls that come with it (I had to get spicy shrimp since I'm preggers) are delicious. The bento box comes with miso soup, a house salad (not usually a fan of iceberg lettuce, but worth eating to sop up the sesame ginger dressing), two potstickers and two rolls.   Also, if you want to try good Korean, get their bulgogi meal. Being half-Korean and having tried my fair share of bulgogi (including while traveling through Korea), this is good stuff. Makes sense, though, as I believe Mr. Young is Korean.   The first time I went here with a group of co-workers, service was a little slow - okay, a lot slow (but, there's debate that it may have been a result of one of our co-workers saying \"oh, no hurry\" when asked if we wanted our checks). During a return visit, though, that same server recognized us, and right away asked if we'd like separate checks, bringing them out promptly. Glad to have a great place to get sushi (dine-in or take-out) nearby."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is cute and very clean. The food is fresh and delicious and the service is really good. They also offer take out which is a plus. I've loved everything that I've tried but my favorites are the Kani salad, the Willoughby roll, and the crab salad roll. I highly recommend this restaurant and I'd give it more stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"I had a few people recommend this place and decided to swing in to try it. I did not understand any of the praise. This was mediocre at best.  The staff was nice enough and the place had an interesting setup... but, the main event was not very good overall.  First off... waaaaay too much rice. It was as much rice or more than a cheap all you can eat place would use. The rice to fish ratio was way off.  Second... not everything needs to have cream cheese. It can be quite overpowering and takes away the taste of the fish, the rice, or anything else you serve it with. It is okay to have it in a few rolls... but almost everything on the menu had cream cheese."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in the area...the spicy mayo that Mr. Young puts on the rolls is amazing...same with the house made tempura flakes on the crunch rolls."}
{"text":"Today I realized something that turned my stomach: you shouldn't eat anything raw there.  It is just plain ignorant. The sushi chef, as many of us too, had a very bad cold.  Sitting at the sushi bar I witnessed him blowing his nose into a paper towel then proceeding to roll sushi.  He also handled his cellphone many times.  I only wish he had washed his hands.  However, during my 1 hour stay there he never did so. And I really used to like the place and visited very often."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi in Willoughby - they make very solid rolls - just wish inside the restaurant was nicer - perfect place for takeout"}
{"text":"wow rotten fish and nasty owner):"}
{"text":"Certainly there is no better sushi in the Cleveland area. You also cannot beat their prices for the quality!"}
{"text":"After being utterly disappointed with another downtown willoughby sushi spot, I heard that their sushi chef opened up his own restaurant a block away. So, I stopped in and was very impressed with the variety and quality of dishes. It's a small, modest restaurant, but the food is very satisfying. Being from cuyahoga county, I have never been to a restaurant that allows you to bring your own alcohol. Since there is a corner store next door, this was great. Only thing to prepare for is... they cannot store the alcohol, so bring your own mini cooler.  I have tried the octopus salad, tasted like octopus in a teriyaki sauce-fine. Also, ordered the veggie pot stickers (dumplings) which were really good. Just ask for the eel sauce for dipping. I have had the crab roll (wouldn't order it again). Cali roll, added cream cheese, is done with imitation crab and I didn't think it was anything special. I enjoyed the philly roll and liked the salmon. Even though it is not smoked, like some other philly rolls I have had. My favorite roll that I have tried so far is the spicy tuna roll. I order it every time I'm there and I love it.  Out of the specialty rolls I have had the clark roll and spider roll. The spider roll is made with soft shell crab and a special sauce, which was different. I wouldn't say I would order it again. The spider roll was enjoyable, other than the artificial crab salad that is piled on top. I would stick with apps, entrees and sushi rolls versus the maki rolls. The two I have had were fine, but I have had better.   One thing I really enjoyed was the bulgogi. It comes with a soup and salad, which were really yummy and completely devoured. Then the entree is served with nice quality, thinly sliced rib eye beef. Sauteed with mushrooms and carrots, and a nice sauce similar to a teriyaki. White rice and pickled veggies on the side. I didn't touch the pickled veggies, but dumped my rice in my bulgogi and went to town. Def worth the $30 per person price tag. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! Top quality, great service, incredible sushi! Highly recommend it! Try the volcano roll with extra spicy mayo on the side.. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"i love them. Always welcoming and no arguments about special requests.  Pheonix roll is still to die for, but honestly every thing has been great. Great to the point where I dont even go to any other sushi restaurants around the area. They even will wrap your sushi in tin foil, so its easier to sneak into the movies if you're into that sort of thing (Which i definitely appreciative about that. Love them Give them a whirl too."}
{"text":"Place does not look like you might think when first arriving , but the lady helping us was very nice and welcoming. I ordered a bowl of assorted raw fish on white rice and the portion was larger than I thought. Prices are a little high,  but very delicious hole in the wall kinda place."}
{"text":"Went to this spot on 05/09/17 with a friend from work and we both got takeout from here......later that night we both got sick and my friend had to go to urgent care!"}
{"text":"Hue Dup Bap is wonderful.  Itami-san not very experienced with Temaki (hand rolls) but Nigiri and Maki are tops.  Opens at noon, would like it if it would open a tad earlier to beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I have been here three times thus far and have never had a bad experience. They used to be BYOB which was awesome because they have a Convenient right next door. 4 Locos and Kappa Maki personally sounds like a good idea to me. However they did away with this so the last time I walked in with tall boys I got several WTF looks from the other diners. Oh well, wouldn't be the first time I show up overcompensated with booze. The servicers are kind and don't linger too much yet are there when you need them. Their kitchen is small and cramped but they turn out fresh, clean rolls at decent prices. Great place to get a quite bite before stumbling around DTW for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. If you like bones in your sushi...youll love this place. I gave it two stars because the waitress was great. Wasnt her fault I had eel bones in my sushi."}
{"text":"This would average out to be at least 5 stars.  4 Stars for the Sushi 5+ Stars for Customer Service!  These folks were incredibly friendly.  You can tell they care!!!  Just their attitude alone compels me to return.  Couple that with very good sushi and you have a place that absolutely deserves (because they earned it) the support of the community!    Great place!!!"}
{"text":"Best place we have had sushi in Willoughby! Great variety of sushi and other dishes. Doesn't look like a fancy place from the outside but the food was amazing. They did have a patio which is where we ate and was nice for the summer time !  Everything held together well and fresh! We will be back ."}
{"text":"If you want quality sushi then this is your place. Young definitely knows his stuff.  I wont get sushi anywhere else."}
{"text":"My first time ordering from them. I have heard good things about them. We ordered take out: Dragon, Crunch,  Philadelphia, Firebird (recommended by my barber) and the Spider.   It's not a fancy place, but the sushi is good. It's well worth the cost."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Youngs for lunch and it has been at most satisfactory. My wife and I who are both Sushi efficianados decided to try it for dinner since it was near to our shopping.  We wanted to order their most expensive Sushi, Sashimi platter with wine bringing our meal to over $60. They had the nerve to tell us that Miso soup and salad are extra even with their specialty combination dishes. We decided to eat at one of the other dozen plus restaurants in the area who do not follow this practice. Their Sushi sizes are a lot to be desires and are comparible to what you get in the Supermarket."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh sushi at a reasonable price. I've tried many different things on the menu and it's always been fresh and well made. This isn't a super nice sit down sushi joint, but they have a cool patio and great for carryout."}
{"text":"Had quite a hankering for some sushi tonight and not wanting to get all dolled up to go out, I decided to get some sushi take-out. With my options being limited to pretty much the Giant Eagle Sushi counter, I figured I'd give Young's Sushi a try. I have heard this place is owned by the old sushi chef from Lure Bistro down the street and since I've always loved their sushi, it was bound to be delicious. I ordered the Kani Salad, the spicy spring roll and the snow crab roll, all were fresh and delicious. The spicy spring roll had some sort of veggie in it (zucchini maybe?) that was very hard to chew so I enjoyed that roll the least but it still had a good sauce. Anytime I am wanting sushi and not vibing the trendy sushi places, this will definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Good for hwe dup bap but Disappointing take out food. Chicken Katsu was bland, unfresh and dry. Eel roll was bland and unfresh too. Had better experience eating in the restaurant but take out was horrible."}
{"text":"Had this for the first time the other day! Amazing! They were very accommodating to the fact that I don't eat seaweed. They wrapped my sushi an alternative way! It was so delicious! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Young's a few times now for lunch.  I no longer eat fish or seafood so I'm a strange customer for sushi.  I always order the veggie Bento box for $9 and it's a perfect, hearty meal.  It comes with a decent miso soup that contains a few chunks of tofu and a standard salad with a ginger dressing, very similar to those I've had in hibachi restaurants.    The soup was noticeably tastier on my last visit.  You get two types of veggie rolls that both contain avocado.  Fresh cucumber and carrots are at least two of the other veggies - good combos of flavor.   The pot stickers are also vegetarian and very tasty.  I haven't had any complaints and haven't been disappointed.  I look forward to the next visit.     Always fresh, always tasty and always satisfying.  I'm glad this place is so close.  Years ago I had checked in and promptly walked out due to the 'take-out' look to the place, but I'm glad some work friends told me to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Most of my low rating is for the jerk that waited on me from the bar. Their menu was labeled cryptically for the special on Tuesdays and when I got a bill I was expecting to be half off the bartender/server didn't try to fix the problem or apologize for the misunderstanding, he got belligerent with me and rolled his eyes at one point. I won't return unless he's not there. The other server (possibly in management) that intervened was very kind but still did not try to give me the discount that was at fault of the poorly labeled menu. The sushi is nothing above decent grocery store sushi and is nearly 3 times the price."}
{"text":"Young's Sushi in Willoughby and Pacific East (their Coventry location only) are the best IN NEOH. I really like Youngs.  It reminds of the sushi dives I frequented when I lived in California.  Low key, good service, appears family run, fair prices some really good unique maki rolls. Sometimes they run out of things but I'm okay with that at any restaurant but especially one serving raw fish.    If you like sushi try Youngs."}
{"text":"Young's is really hit and miss.   The lunch special is an amazing deal.  With dinner, it really depends on what you order and the sushi experience you are looking for.    The fish is pretty fresh, but there are too many Americanized rolls for my taste.  The Rainbow roll is the best if you are looking for actual raw fish.  Most of the other rolls are covered in sauce, though, so ask if you don't want to pay $10 for a mouthful of Saracha.  I learned this the hard way last night when I ordered a Firebird Roll for $11.00 (Tuna, Salmon, Red Snapper, White Tuna, Crab Meat, Cucumber and Avocado), and even though the menu doesn't mention sauce but was completely doused in it when it arrived at the table.  I've had better luck with the smaller rolls and sashimi.    The appetizers come from the freezer- gyoza, shumai, agedashi tofu- nothing is fresh.  I ordered the agedashi tofu (a favorite of mine from Japan) and was very disappointed that it was that thick rubbery re-heated texture with okonomiyaki sauce drizzled on top of it.    I've had slightly better experiences at Young's but usually come away disappointed wanting a little more from Mr. Young given his reputation.  Young's is located in a strip mall next to a salon and convenience store.  It is also BYOB which is great for cheaper date nights."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here before?  Stopped in my lunch today and was pleased with prices, service, food, and quantity.  I'm a vegetarian and I got the veggie bento box.  I couldn't have the miso soup that was included because it had fish in it, which is okay.  9.50 for 2 different veggie sushies (6 per roll), a salad, and potstickers.  Holy sticky rice!   My mom got a bento with nigiri and sashimi plus a roll, potstickers, salad, and soup for 15.  Cannot go wrong here!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, and fresh sushi. By far, the best in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Interesting space, very friendly, beer and wine and you can watch them make your sushi on tv!"}
{"text":"Great little \"hole in the wall\" spot!  The sushi was excellent and so was the service.  Our server was very attentive and came past often.  Definitely order the octopus salad as an appetizer.  Will return often to try more of their sushi variety."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for sushi in the area. The Phoenix rolls are incredible. Fast and friendly service. Also really like their edamame and seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Great little sushi spot hidden in Willoughby. Service was quick and great! Even have a cool little camera, so you can watch them roll your sushi."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick lunch when I was in the area for work. Small unassuming location but the ratings were solid so I thought I'd chance it. I'm not saying I'm a sushi aficionado but this was a pretty solid experience. I prefer simplicity so ordered the spicy tuna & salmon rolls. As mentioned; very solid.   The service was prompt and the server was very personable. A lady who I assumed was the owner, also came by and checked in on my colleague & I a few times, which we appreciated.  All in all, next time I'm in Willoughby, I have a go to sushi spot : )"}
{"text":"Excellent low key sushi spot. Attentive and friendly staff, excellent sushi. Try the spicy tuna roll!"}
{"text":"Rotten. Slimy. Discolored. Putrid. After reading reviews, I wanted to try this little hole in the wall. Big mistake. It's right next to a convenient store... That should have been the warning. We ordered a spicy tuna roll to test the quality. When it came out it looked slimy and the smell was overwhelming. We left $6.50 without even touching it and left. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great price, great service !!! Highly recommended  They have a live video feed to a tv so you can see the sushi being made."}
{"text":"My friend had told me about this sushi restaurant in Willoughby that is a complete hole in the wall. Her words \"You will not find better sushi on the east side of Cleveland then Young's\". We went for a girls night and she was not wrong.   This place may not have a ton of room or the best decor, but when you just want delicious sushi, then this is your place. We have been back so many times since and my friend actually goes twice a week. We cannot help it but it tastes so fresh and you can see them making it as well!  Who needs fancy decor as long as the food is delicious! I cannot say enough good things about Young's! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Spontaneously stopped here for the first time today and got five rolls for two people. Each one was amazing.  The service was friendly and the rolls were prepared quickly.  My favorite was the Young Sushi Roll."}
{"text":"Young's Sushi. Wow. How have I never known that such amazing sushi is so close. This cute little place located next to a hair salon and convenient store has lots of character and definitely the best sushi around. The miso soup and pot stickers are amazing as well. I would say go for the eel roll and the dynamite roll. Both super delicious! :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best sushi around Cleveland! Don't be fooled by the location or the appearance! They do serve beer and wine. Yelp says there is a TV, there is but it is to watch them make your sushi not for sports or anything."}
{"text":"I finally tried Young's Sushi. The sushi rice is very good. Young really takes his sushi to an art. I tried the Octopus salad and I really liked it. It's has more of a Korean taste with sesame oil, soy, a little spicy and crunch from seaweed. Really enjoyed it. I will try the Bulgogi next time."}
{"text":"YUM! I'm a big sushi fan and this place is perfect. Small setting with a homey asian atmosphere. You can see the sushi chef rolling it at the little bar area they have set up or on the monitor on the wall. I went to introduce my boyfriend to real sushi, not the basic california rolls he's had in the past. He really enjoyed it. Recommend the miso soup as a starter and the love roll and spicy tuna, we also tried the mexican roll which was just as good as the other two!"}
{"text":"I've been to Young's several times and have usually found the food quality to be decent. Not great, but adequate. When I got takeout a few weeks ago, I was horrified to discover that every piece of salmon in my $25 sushi/sashimi combo was discolored. I sent Young's a message via their Facebook page, figuring I'd handle the issue privately rather than publicly lambasting them, but they didn't have the decency to reply, so beware, Yelpers, especially in light of recent warnings about tapeworms in salmon. I'm adding the photo of my discolored fish to the photo stream if anyone would like to be grossed out."}
{"text":"We love sushi and try new places as we hear about them. Young's had received a few good reviews so we tried it.... turned out to be somewhat of a dissapointment.  Not a total bummer but certainly not what we were expecting.   The sushi was just so-so and was not chilled (warm enough we were concerned about the safety of eating it)  Portions were smaller than most other local establishments we have tried.  Our non-asian server was not 100% familiar with the menu and didn't know the answer to most questions.  We were really suprised at the atmosphere, not what you'd expect from a Japanese restaurant at all.   Music was excessively loud 80's hard rock!  Again, not what I felt appropriate for dinner music.  Wait until you see it's location and exterior.  Not appealing at all.   Located in a rundown strip center next to a convenience store.  Really needs a major update!  There are better sushi restaurants in the area but we are willing to give Young's another try just to make sure they weren't having a bad night.  Just don't set your expectations too high.  BTW - the little monitor that let's you see your order being prepared is an interesting touch but not very well excecuted."}
{"text":"I went back and fourth on four or five stars. I've been here about twenty times so I obviously truly enjoy the sushi here. The staff is super friendly in a pleasant odd way. The sushi is amazing and fresh, you can even watch them make it on a 26inch flat screen. The top sushi place in the area, definitely better than Lure. It got four stars because it used to be BYOB and now it isn't. Parking is not so Bueno (I parked in front of convenient store one time and guy came out yelling at me). But all things aside this is a hidden gem. Eat here."}
{"text":"Even though I felt it was a bit pricey for what I ordered, the food was really good, and prepared quickly. If you're a sushi fan, but just looking for a quiet and relaxed place, I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I've already reviewed this place and I love it, but I wanted to add when I stopped in for a quick bite yesterday, my friend and I had Gabby (I believe that is her name, sorry if I misspelled it)and she was the most delightful server. She was so sweet and bubbly and just truly added a great element to our dining experience. Go in just to see her, she will brighten your day"}
{"text":"We love sushi so we decided to give this place a try based on the positive reviews. This place disappointed though. The sushi was just ok, no better than any of the the other generic joints around downtown Willoughby. We ordered three premium rolls with a couple of beers and paid $60, way to much considering we paid the same at Ginkos last week for a waaay better meal. I feel that the extra 20 minute ride down to Tremont is definitely worth it to experience a bona fide sushi house for the same peice"}
{"text":"Best sushi in northeast Ohio!  Hands Down!   Get the miso soup and the phoenix roll is my fav on the menu...and the Las Vegas roll.  I love supporting Young and this hole in the wall restaurant ...u can watch all the rolls on the tv be made before ur meal is presented since they have cameras hovering over the chef ...."}
{"text":"There's better sushi to be had. Service was friendly enough but the quality and selection leaves much to be desired. Granted, it's hard to procure fresh fish in these parts and one's expectations cannot be set too high in terms of variety. A 2.5 stars is a fair estimation in my opinion, as turn over rate is low for the fish and the rice is so-so. A 3 star is reserved for a solid sushi joint in my book. I'm sorry this spot doesn't really entice me to become a regular as it's so close to home. I just happened to find its interior and menu uninspired. Just passable, not noteworthy."}
{"text":"Ok this is one of those places that I have heard about for years, it's close by but I never went until now.   It's a small place, maybe 10 tables and 4 seats at the bar. I tried the Cali roll, rainbow roll and Manhattan roll. The wife had the shashimi plate and every bite was fantastic. The sushi was fresh and the rolls were very well made. I don't know why we waited so long to go here. The waitress was very helpful because I don't want mayo anywhere near my sushi! Whoever started that tread should be flogged. But she was great to tell me what to stay away from.   They do dine in and take out and they are open until 930pm! It's so close to the house I will be picking up some sushi rolls really soon!"}
{"text":"Love Young's Sushi! It's the best sushi around. Their spicy tuna roll is amazing!! The only downfall is that I wish that they did a sushi happy hour or half price special. They are all just too good!"}
{"text":"Love it every time i went there! James is very creative and passionate sushi chef! My favorite is a roll with battered and fried soft crab. You can see it upclose how he creates it :)"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had hands down. However, the appetizers and miso are nothing special which is disappointing considering how amazing the sushi is."}
{"text":"Sushi was OK but not really worth going back for, atmosphere like a diner.  I prefer a place with more variety and character."}
{"text":"I had a great experience my first time here, but consistency is also important.  I came for a second visit on a weekend for lunch.  There were only 2 tables there.  I think they must have been working on a large take-out order at the same time, because large trays were being assembled.  Regardless, that's no reason to ignore your tables.  We had to literally go get the waitress to put in the order.  The food took really long to come out.  The sashimi slices were ridiculously smalled chopped up pieces, at best 1/3 of the size of fish slices you would expect.  There wasn't even any ginger/wasabi on our sashimi tray, and we had a hard time getting the waitress to pay any attention to us to even request some.  I ended up getting up and walking up to the sushi chef to ask for some.  His response was that I should ask the waitress.  I've been here on other evenings when the father of the family has been working and it's always been a surprise how great this place is.  Today it was the son working, and maybe he has less experience, maybe he was overwhelmed with the take-out order, I don't know.  It's sad though, because we likely won't be back.  The one other table that was there at the same time also had some trouble.  They got their check, then the waitress came back and took the check back saying she forgot to put the 50% off discount that was supposed to be on there.  She came back to the table again and said she was mistaken and they don't get any discount, handed them the original full bill again.  Talk about needing to get their act together.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi is Pacific East in Coventry but when I don't want to drive half hour to get there, this is a good local substitute for us on the very east side (Willoughby/Mentor/Painesville). It's definitely mom and pop but don't let that fool you. This place has excellent quality sushi at decent prices. The service is slow but then again, it's mom and pop so there aren't 4 sushi chefs cranking out orders. My only complaint is that there isn't more of a variety on the menu, and a lot of the rolls include cream cheese."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to a sushi place close to home so I decided to stop by here. From the outside it can look like nothing special but this place is great! The service is wonderful and the sushi is fresh. I really enjoyed watching the chef make the sushi from the monitor on the wall. Definitely want to try the bulgogi next time I go!"}
