{"text":"Really hurts me to have update my review. I loved this place, food was always great, sure the service was sometimes slow, but it made up for it when we got the food to the table. I've been there number of times, but yesterday might have been my last. Go inside at opening and notice the food menu has shrank. The options now are the burger, the cevapi, and a veggie sandwich. Not overly bad because I usually either get the burger or the cevapi, even though I was thinking of actually trying something new this time.  Mentioning that to our server, she stated the place is now under new management, so they redid things. That had me a bit concerned. We ordered our food, it came, no longer on the neat wood platters, just on a normal plate. Not a huge issue it was just a neat presentation. Looking at the burger it looked different. The meat patty just looked like a regular burger, unlike it's previous version which was 2 very thin patties that were cooked and then \"glued\" with cheese. Thinking the cheese was gone completely even though it was stated on the menu I kind of ripped into the patty to find it in there. So it looks like they just form the patty with the cheese and then cook. Either way not huge, just different. But then when I stared eating it just didn't have the same flavour. Kind of bland. The fries although similar were really salty.  So since I don't live near by or really come to the area that often, I'll probably not be going back again, unless I hear things have improved."}
{"text":"As other reviews have mentioned, this has to be one of the best burgers in the city!  I came here because I was curious about going to a Croatian restaurant.  I had the sausage dinner because I wanted to order something that was Croatian but my friend had the burger and I was definitely envious.  The sausage was great too, but the burger was amazing (I had a little piece of it).  I had a great Croatian beer (can't remember the name of it but it started with a K - worth checking out).  We had the crepes for dessert and they were delicious.  Our waiter was extremely friendly - fantastic service.  It felt like a very 'warm' place - everyone seemed to know everyone and I just got a really good vibe from the people and the place.  I would definitely come back.  And next time, I'll order the burger!"}
{"text":"I think the place is shut down, conveniently just before the expiry of their groupon!  Have been trying to call them repeated but no one answers the phone. SCAMMERS!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks on a Saturday night.  Nice selection of bottled beers, and 4 beers on tap.  Ambiance could have been better since the lights were a bit bright and music was intermittent as it seemed to be controlled by patrons seated at the bar.  Will maybe give it a second chance another night if not for drinks, then to try the food."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get shitfaced with a great variety of beer you wish other places had. I'm excited about this patio they say they have coming soon- it's patio season now and they aren't looking like it's ready yet otherwise we'd so be there.  Burger was really greasy, It's good for what it is but we need to be able to customize our burgers a bit more..nothing wrong with it we just like to get sick with our junk food and throw on ever possible topping and sauce, their menu is straight forward and I look forward to trying other things, but even if the food isn't for you the beer selection and tucked away location is perfect for our low-key intimate evenings."}
{"text":"Best burger in the city!  What else do you need to know?  I've been to Hrvati a couple times now with friends and have enjoyed the food, beer, and atmosphere. It's a tiny little place with a huge communal table. There's a unique selection of beer. I've only ever had the burger with a side of cabbage (I don't like fries), but from what my friends have told me, everything is delicious. Service may have been a bit slow, but it didn't bother me."}
{"text":"I had the cevepi and it was quite good. The little skinless sausages were cooked nicely, it was juicy and flavorful.  It tasted no different than a well-made (ie: scratch-made), well seasoned hamburger patty.   What makes this elevate from a 'good dish' to a 'really good dish', - better than just a tasty burger at your favorite burger place -  is the bun. The Croatian bun is outstanding. Buttered and slightly toasted on the flattop, the chewy and slightly sweet texture of the bread is delicious and pairs nicely with the dense meatiness of the sausages.    What was missing from the platter, however, was something pickled or sharp..like pickled onions or even raw.  Since this dish is no more than a good deconstructed hamburger (with a kick-ass bun mind you), it begs for the regular burger fixins (my preference is hot peppers and onions).  I have a feeling this place may be inconsistent.. My dish didn't come with the eggplant side that it should have, and the bun was cut up in little pieces.  Other pictures uploaded look very different than mine (size, cut and sides)  Yukon gold fries were good and the Croatian beer - Ozujsko was a really nice accompaniment.  Worth it.  (overpriced, glorified burger but well worth it)."}
{"text":"Food was very disappointing.  The Cevapi weren't anything speciality the worst I've ever had.  The schnitzel  with a couple of capers on top wasn't very Croatian inspired at all.  It would have been better with just lemons or a more Croatian satras(h)-type of sauce with tomato, onion and peppers. The potato salad was DISGUSTING- a cold mashed sweet potato puree with harder chunks of white potatoes in there.?!?! The room temperature/lukewarm red cabbage side was very sweet and greasy.  The ambiance/rustic decor was nice and service good.  It is a shame the food was an insult to Croatian cooking!"}
{"text":"Went last night with a groupon.  I'm so glad places like this offer groupons bc I never would have found such a place otherwise.  I made a reservation but it was unecessary on the Sunday night.  The decor is awesome, from the tiles on the ceiling, the long wood table in the middle of the room, the art and old 'from down home' pics on the wall.  It is outstanding to look at.  The big communal table can offer a chance for guests to talk to one another, which I like when there are friendly interesting guests sitting next to you.  There is also bar stool seating around the room.  Most of the food was served n a slab of wood, so very original.  I like.  The napkins are kitchen towel rags, pretty cool.  The guest beside me also had a groupon but it expired a few days ago and when they came, the resto was closed due to a problem in the kitchen but they kindly and happily accepted the groupon even though it was past due.  My son had the veggie meal, (only one on the menu), fries, very good, coleslaw, very good, sandwich, too salty.  I could see he had a hard time downing it bc of the salt.  But he said otherwise, it was really good.  I had the goulash, which is actually not goulash, it's beef stew on noodles.  There were too many noodles, the carrots were yucky tasting - I personally like farmers market carrots, not, pesticide laden, factory grown, ones.  These are the carrots I wouldn't eat as a kid bc they tasted so yucky, I only started eating carrots once I had organic ones from farmers.  The beef was excellent though.  Tender, tasty, no fat or grisol to pick out of my mouth while I am eating,  The overall taste was average, like I said, beef stew on noodles.  I ordered a side of potato salad, it was very different from the Canadian version.  More like a sweet potato mix of mashed potatoes.  Very good, cold, nice.  I heard the burgers are good. Half of the menu were pork items.  I can't eat pork, but the people there also eating seemed happy with their meals.  Points lost here, too salty sandwich, average tasting goulash, too many noodles and yucky carrots."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase here...  Food - One of the top 5 perfect burger and fries I've ever consumed. The hamburger bun alone is a soft, chewy dream. Atmosphere - Cute and cozy. It's a perfect place to bring someone that you've wanted to impress with your off the beaten path restaurant reco. Drink - Fantastic beer list. Ordering the Dieu du Ciel will knock you on your arse.  Hrvati Bar answers the question, What's for din din?"}
{"text":"My need to check out Hrvati began after reading it dubbed the \"best old-world beer hall\" in Toronto Life's Best Bars 2012 listing (http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/from-the-print-edition-daily-dish/2012/02/13/best-bars-2012-beer/4/#hall). Now, I don't mean to perpetuate TO Life as the gospel, but anything that showcases new drink does tend to leave me with a favourable bias. Bolstering Hrvati's allure is its Croatian slant - a unique strategy that plays to the hearts (and stomachs) of those from the Old Country and travelers to the region alike. Of course, stocking a diverse selection that encompasses many hard-to-find numbers from the Balkans and beyond is the effective Pied Piper for those that love and appreciate fine beer (such as me!).  AMBIANCE:  Communal bench seating anchors Hrvati around a large wooden table reminiscent of those in Munich. The place is small, but the beer list grandly on display makes up for that. The mood is cozy, yet boisterous. The music isn't overbearing, but the selection oddly fitting; example: Spice Girls. Brit pop in Croatian bar in Korea Town - go figure.  DRINK:  Great selection spanning most of Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North and Central America. A down side is their limited options on tap (most come in tall boy cans or bottles). The Croatian Karlovacko went down easy and offers a crisp finish with flavour. The Slovenian Lasko is refreshing with undertones of summer fruit.  To my dismay, I was unable to find Svyturys - a beauty of a Lithuanian lager I encountered on my way to Croatia (I realize that Balkan does not equal Baltic, but I was hopeful that somehow, someway the eastern European connection would suffice. P.S. If anyone in Toronto knows where to find it, I'll be forever indebted!).  FOOD:  Authentic meals with a modern twist. Although original and flavourful, I found the burger lacked a certain pop. Moreover, the yogurt sauce topping was somewhat underwhelming. The fries, however, had a great balance of salt and crunch. The side of slaw had peppery zip, and the lemon aioli dipping sauce was rich and complementary. My meal mate had the sausage platter, which he endorsed.  COST:  Reasonable given that most beers are imports and tall boys (~$7). Food averages in the mid-teens, and is good value.  SERVICE:  Definitely the low point of our experience. It took a while to clear away the table from the previous patrons, then it took a while for menus to come, then it took a while for the food to show up. Our first round of beers came without glasses (which at first I didn't mind, thinking it was a purposeful move to create a rustic, minimalist vibe). Added up, these small things were a bit disappointing.  All in all, this place gets a generous 4. I'm optimistic given its creative, authentic, risky endeavour to break the mold and try something new. I feel Hrvati caters to an untapped market, and I've no doubt that it will do well. Once the patio gets in full swing (June, apparently - pending Liquor Board approval), it will get to the next level. As a newish bar, I feel it has a few kinks to work out still, but regardless I look forward to going back!  - B"}
{"text":"How sad. My favorite burger in Toronto is now terrible. The once interesting and mysterious bun is overly chewy and bready (both diners leaving half on the plate), and the meat was scant and overcooked. For a drink and a burger each, it was a $50 meal. Injustice! Injustice!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because I had a voucher. I ordered the burger and sausage plate to split with my boyfriend. There was SO much food, we couldn't finish it between the two of us. Seating was limited inside. There is a back patio, but I didn't get a chance to go outside and see it. They had some nice beers on tap, and the waitress helped us decide which one to try. The food was absolutely delicious -- full of so much flavour and spice. However, it's definitely the type of food that makes you want to go brush your teeth after or chew a piece of gum if you are planning on meeting up with others afterwards."}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 if I could.  Lots to like about this place, but a lot of shortcomings as well.  The beer list is great, but many bottles.  The on-tap selection is actually pretty limited.  Food was very good for pub food.  We had the burger (very good) and the sausage platter (also very good).  The sausages were very similar to the burger, which I found surprising - like they rolled up minced meat and grilled it in tubes.  More like a middle-eastern kabob than an eastern European sausage.  We sat on the patio, which was not very comfortable.  Our long communal table leaned and buckled precariously when anyone sat down or stood up, which is a bit alarming when it's covered in beers.  Also the ground and tables were not leveled, making it a bit awkward.  I will probably go back because although it's not perfect it's got something unique to offer."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to trying Hrvati for some time. I'd give to food 4/5, but won't return for a few reasons.  The first is that I waited an hour and twenty minutes for my dinner. I was told the pork sausage would take some extra time, but an hour and twenty minutes? There is just no way it can take that long, especially since the restaurant was nearly empty.  The food prices were a tad high, but since it was good quality I didn't mind. The beer was overpriced. $7-$8 pre-tip is just too much for a pint of beer from Canada. Especially when I practically had to beg for service.   It was evident the owner wasn't around, as many times there was literally no staff on the floor. After 15 minutes of waiting for my bill and no staff to ask for it, I was tempted to walk out. I love to support local businesses, but this place really needs to shape up if they expect regular customers. I hope this was an off night, but at these prices I won't be bothering to return to find out."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food and the place wasn't that busy. The owner did significantly reduce our bill. But the food wasn't that great anyway. The best was the burger and the red cabbage. Do skip the burnt and dry schnitzel. Beer prices marginally above anything else in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"dim cozy setting, with a big communal table... really reminded me of some of the restaurants in Bulgaria back when i lived there.. i shared, yes shared a burger with my BF and a beer each, it was absolutely delicious and big enough for two average appetite.. the fries and coleslaw were as good as the burger. will be back for some more rustic ambiance and the burger.."}
{"text":"A hipsterific take on rustic Croatian (in a good way).  Located in one half an old house on Euclid  just North of Bloor, this joint is pretty easy to miss so If you have passed the alley young grasshopper, know that you have gone too far and turn back around.    The place itself is cozy in a Eastern European watering hole kind of way.  *Disclaimer* Please note that by cozy I also mean small, like really small.......really really small.  Meaning if you are a big group calling ahead is a good idea and if tight spaces make you uneasy some deep breathing or pharmaceutical assistance might be a better idea.  That being said, weather permitting there is a really nice and less claustrophobic patio hidden out back.   I say hidden because you can only get to it from the side of the house, like a secret garden or the field of dreams (i.e. beer).   The patio is not massive, but the few communal beer hall style tables can accommodate a small group of friends and the close quarters are sure to encourage conversation even amongst the socially awkward.  Be warned however, this is a Croatian themed bar and smoking is permitted on the back patio. If you're sensitive to smoke you may want to opt for indoors, if not then strangely enough I find it adds to the authenticity and charm of the place.   As mentioned by those before me, the beer selection is extensive. The impressive number of menacing looking Eastern European beers are almost seductive even.  Always being one to beat a dead horse however, I will repeat the fact that most of these beers only come in bottles. But don't fret if you're fussy like that, there are also a few decent options on tap.  And for those who prefer to cut straight to the chase, plum brandy, vodka and other spirits are also served.  And of course the Croatian experience would not be complete without something hearty (read: MEATY) to sop up some of that alcohol.  While there is a decent list of homestyle favourites and a vegetarian item on the menu, the real star of the show is the hot sexy mess of a burger - a meaty, cheesy, salty magical taste explosion nestled in between a warm soft lepinje and crowned with caramelized onions.  What is lepinje you ask?  Well words can't even begin to describe it's awesomeness, so just know it is a carbaholic's wet dream.  If you are a shares-ies kind of person and going with a friend or two I would also recommend ordering the Cevapi (sausage) platter.  As a side note know that Croatian sausages are more akin to Middle Eastern kebabs than say bratwurst, and Hrvati does not disappoint with their tasty rendition.  The  Cevapi platter also comes loaded with even more of the carbtastic lepinje, some ajvar (a savoury red pepper spread) and kajmak (a greek yogurty type dairy product) for dipping and a side of perfectly seasoned fries.  In place of the fries, or maybe in addition if you really have a love jones for potatoes, I would strongly urge you to order the potato salad.  Unlike the mayo laden atrocities that plague most restaurant plates, the Hrvati version looks deceivingly more like a curried Indian dish, but tastes like a suped up version of the Eastern European variety (read: not creamy). For after dinner, there are also a few crepes on the menu as well if by some miracle you still have room.  Also, just a heads up know that portions are hefty, so be sure to come hungry and rock an elastic waistband to make the most of your visit."}
{"text":"I chose Hrvati for my going away party and I couldn't be happier; I can't believe I didn't find it earlier being around the Annex and Korea Town so much but apparently I have no peripheral vision for side streets.  Pop on back there for some Cevapi that's really done well with some great beers or wine. The patio beer hall style with long tables was great for our group that I gave very little notice to, for either them or the restaurant but all went fantastically!  It is a bit difficult to go from inside to outside, having to walk the side path back, so let your group know ahead of time which locale is the target for imbibing."}
{"text":"Fries were too salty. Burger was a little dry. But they have a cosy patio and good beer selection, so a decent experience if you really are the person who enjoys a drink on a patio."}
{"text":"Went tonight at around 7pm, waited 1hr before going up to ask them about our order, (burgers, and by then nobody had come to check on us or get us any drink refills) and without checking with the kitchen the server says that everybody ordered at the same time and to bare with them. People who came in after us, got their food first then the server realized the kitchen never got our order. We were offered a free drink as a compensation. By then it was almost 2 hrs. We got our burgers, couldn't eat the fries as they were caked in salt and we had to leave for work, too.  The meal came to $38+tax= 42.94 BUT for us it cost additionally 1 hr + of waiting x 2 people = approximately $60 ($30/hr if we were working)    -we were only offered an apology and 2 free drinks...  Poor service and poor course of action after the fact means we would not return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 9:30 - it's suuuper cute!!! GAH! I think it used to be someone's house, which makes me wanna know if there are any roaming ghosts. There's a bar-like table facing the window, then a big communal table, some additional two person (can u say romantic??) tables (more like bars sticking out of the wall) and a decent size bar. They have an awesome beer selection, including Baltica, Lasko, Hoegaarden and Grolsch! I sat at the window table which is great for hipster watching. I had a QC wheat beer that tasted like Hoegaarden but for the life of me I cannot remember the name... SORRRYYY! They have it on tap though :)  I didn't try the food but I will most definitely be back because a) i love this bar and b) the food smelled amazing, so a review update is to follow!!  The bathrooms are hilarious...i hit my head on the way down both times and if i was like an inch wider i don't think I would fit down the stairs. The path is narrower than Simon Cowell's mind. Once in the bathroom, if you are 5'2 and up, you will not be able to see the top of your head. The taller you are, the less of your upper body you see in the mirror. I thought it was really funny and it didn't bother me at all, so koodos to them for having a memorable WC!  Server was super nice, I think her and I had an awkward moment and now I'm kind of embarassed but meh (sorry lady, I don't know what I did!)"}
{"text":"Sat on the patio in the back where there were way too many smokers. blech. There's basically just one table inside the place - so the patio is kind of your only option. Beer selection is ok in bottles. Draft selection, not so impressive.  Had the burger. It was decent. There was some sour-creamy sauce in it which I didn't think would work but it somehow did.   I probably wouldn't go back here unless someone I was with was really hell bent on it ."}
{"text":"I came here for Burger Week in May and really enjoyed their burger! So when my friend invited me to go to Hrvati again because she had a $15 for $30 worth of food voucher, I said yes. We got the sausage platter and of course the burger again. The sausage platter was ok. Not exactly something I would order again although I like the sauce on the side. The burger was the highlight of the meal. It tasted just like I remembered from Burger Week. This time the burger came with a side of fries and dipping sauce. The fries were done perfectly and the sauce was delicious. Not sure what the sauce was made of but I think I tasted a hint of garlic (so instant winner for me).  I never expect this restaurant to be packed since it's hidden. We arrived at the restaurant slightly before 6 and it was starting to get packed. So make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I went to Hrvati this weekend and enjoyed the place.  The fries were brilliant, the beer menu is extensive and it has a good atmosphere.  A few minor complaints, 1. they only have a couple of beers on draught, and as anyone who drinks beer knows, draught is the best way to enjoy suds.  2. the service wasn't tip top.  It took us a while to get our first order in.  Once we got started the service was pretty good but it took a bit of time, it was Friday night and it seemed as though they weren't prepared for a busy night.    But back to the positives, the food is phenomenal.  I just had a bowl of fries to munch on and they were among the best fries I had ever had, the seasoning is amazing.  My friends had other things and were impressed, plus the burgers looked great (and from what I hear they taste better than they look).  The place is very compact so seating was tricky, but we sat at the bar and found that everyone was super friendly so it worked out perfectly,   I would definitely recommend this place, although I do wish they had a better draught menu..."}
{"text":"I had been craving a burger and remembered walking by Hrvati before it opened and thinking they would probably serve some decent meaty options... I was not disappointed.  A too-huge-to-finish juicy wonder appeared before me served on a slice of tree! As if this giant burger wasn't enough, it also comes with fries and coleslaw. I decided on the only Croatian beer available, Oujsko as that just seemed appropriate. Everything was really tasty and totally reasonably priced for what you get. My friend had the sausage platter which he enjoyed, but he ended up finishing my fries so I'm thinking that meal is maybe not as filling. We were initially the only two patrons, but by the end of our visit there were four other people and the small space seemed to fill up fast. There is little room to maneuver around the long communal table to the higher seating along the perimeter of the room. It's a nice atmosphere though, with wood from floor to ceiling and antique-y portraits.  Our server was friendly and helpful with descriptions of food and beer. This was absolutely the right choice to satisfy my burger craving."}
{"text":"A rustic, hip, woodsy interior welcomes you when you open the door to this new \"Croatian\" style pub located in little korea. The large harvest table is great for a big group, or several parties at once, with additional seating at the bar and in the front window. The small  pub has lots of character and (somewhat) creepy-hipster old fashioned photos etched into the walls.   The menu is short and sweet - hamburger, sausage platter, french fries, veggie platter and crepes with a few other options for sides. I appreciate this - I love a restaurant that do a few things really well and stick to those items. Our group had burgers with fries and coleslaw and the sausage platter. Both were very tasty. The buttered almost ciabatta-like bun on the hamburger had mixed reviews in our group - I personally loved it and found it sopped up the delicious hamburger drippings perfectly. The fries were top-notch, and the aioli was delicious. The coleslaw was a great antidote to the rich and meaty burger.  The sausage platter went over well, but I think the burger was the winner.   Also, the taxes are included in the menu prices, which makes splitting the bill that much easier.   A great new pub, worth a look-see."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: You come here for their burger and home to what is, quite possibly, the city's best burger bun - yes, you read that right, I love their buns! This little Croatian bar is fast becoming one of my favourite hangouts in the 'hood.  So you want to know how good their burger - which comes with double beef patties, topped with some sort of melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles, and held together by a very different sort of bun that is, surprisingly, the highlight of the burger, and accompanied with fries and coleslaw - is? Well, me and 10 of my dining mates recently came here and we all ordered this - and not one of us was disappointed! Honestly, whilst everything else on the menu looks and smells amazing (we were hanging by the bar so we could see everything coming out of the kitchen), you owe it to yourself to order the burger first.  Hrvati also has a vast, although seemingly somewhat random selection of canned/draft beers ranging from Canadian microbreweries (Unibroue, Microbrasserie Charlevoix, Red Racer) to (over-priced) Croatian lagers to PBR and Fruli. Either way, you're sure to find something you like!   The place is SMALL and reservations are recommended if you're going to come with a large party. It can get really hot in here as well. The staff have always been exceptionally cheery, which really lends itself to a very festive (and rowdy) atmosphere, especially as the night gets longer - if you're the sort of person who likes to sing in public spaces, Hrvati could be your bar!"}
{"text":"You know, it's rare that I take the time to write a review about a restaurant...either good or bad but this place deserved to be told.   Cevapi is an institution in Bosnia...Croatia...Serbia...etc. They elevate this simple, yet delicious food as much as we elevate burgers here in North America. Ask any of the locals and they'll tell you Cevapi is an artform. Simple to make but very difficult to get it bang on.   There's not a whole lot of places that serve Cevapi in this fine city of ours but at least those places are authentic, reasonably priced and tasty.   I was excited to hear about Hrvati bar...Rodney Bowers' reputation is stellar. How could this go wrong I thought?   Visited last night and was excited. A few of us ordered the Cevapi, large portion @ $15. Comes with fries, kaymak and avjar. I thought ordering the large, I'd definitely have leftovers to take home. 8 pieces of cevapi is quite a lot. What did we get?   MAYBE half of a lepinje that was anything but fresh. C'mon Rodney...Lepinje is dirt cheap. I'm sure you can afford to give a whole piece of the stuff.   8 pieces of cevapi that were SO SMALL it was a joke. Basically, it's 4 regular sized cevaps that have been cut in half to make 8. RIP OFF. And to boot, the cevaps were dry...waaaaaay too dry. Too overcooked and weren't tasty at all.    Onions? Raw onions are the norm. I didn't get any. Should note my friend did get some sauteed onions with her dish. The kaymak was good but i suspect it's really just philadelphia cream cheese. At least the avjar was ok.   I gotta hand it to the guy that was working. Either he was completely new or just a lost soul. Very courteous but extremely slow service, forgetful and looked like he was lost despite the place being kinda empty. But I gotta hand it to the guy, he might have been cooking, bartending and serving all at the same time.   Should also note that they were out of schnitzel and goulash. It was 7:30pm. Should have been prime time and to have 2 items out of stock when there's only about 5 things on the menu is kinda idiotic.   All in all, there's WAAAY better options out there. If you want real cevaps go to Bosna...or Croatia Restaurant. They're out of the way but service and quality is way better. If you want schnitzel, go to any of the other eastern european restaurants around town...Europe Bar, Cafe Polonez, Chopin..etc.   To sum things up - not only is this place is a rip off but it's doing a series diservice to the kind of food they serve."}
{"text":"I know it is unusual for me to ask my Yelp Friend to meet me at a bar.. a coffee shop maybe? but a bar? There is always a first time!  Hrvati Bar is a great drinking place to meet up with your friends. The large communal table right in the middle of the room give this a beer hall vibe.   Talk about selections of beers... most of them are imported and all priced reasonable from $4.50 or so. I was a little over whelmed by all the choices as I am not an expert in beer. The friendly bartender was patient in helping me and my Yelp Friend to pick something that we both enjoyed.  Hrvati Bar is definitely an excellent alternative compared to the pubs and Korean drinking establishments in the area.   I guess I need to come back to try out the food?! Burger any one? Of course I'm going to wash that down with a beer!!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times. Each time using either a groupon or wagjag $30 for $15 coupon. With the discount it is an outstanding deal! Usually, I get the burger, awesome unique bun, lots of tasty beef and the fries with the dipping sauce are fantastic. Last time had the sausage platter, basically like the burger but broken up into sausage form. Still enjoyed it and it came with a few more dipping sauces I really liked. The food is really good, throw in the great selection of imported beers, and it's a winner. I didn't give it a 5, due to the service being a little off on two of the occasions."}
{"text":"Because you will be confused: Hrvati is located just north of the intersection of Bloor street and Euclid avenue. Look for the round illuminated sign out front. It was a useful herald when my Dining Companion (DC) and I were struggling to find the spot last night.  The name is a bit difficult too. I couldn't find it on Yelp because I kept spelling it wrong. Think R before V like a motorhome. (Herr-vat-ee.) This is also apt because Hrvati is about the size of a motorhome. There are a few two-tops along the walls, a fairly-large communal table down the middle, and bar seating fore and aft. It's a tight squeeze in here.  But that should not scare you from bringing a few Platonic Companions or a Hot Date here for some Croatian-inspired grub. The restaurant has a very rustic charm. Instead of acoustic ceiling tiles they have slabs of distressed pine[1], the lighting is dim and moody, and the old-world wallpaper makes you feel like the Reds could smash through their saloon-doors at any minute and demand your papers.   The menu is simple. There is a much-lauded burger, sausage dishes, a veggie burger, schnitzel and Croatian crêpes. Me and the DC split the pork schnitzel which was served in a buttery caper sauce with mashed potatoes and pickled cabbage. It's a huge portion -- perfect for two moderately hungry patrons -- and it was tasty. It's rich, but the schnitzel was perfectly crispy and the capers weren't too tart. I also enjoyed the pickled cabbage side.  Service was frazzled but friendly. There was just one guy handling the entire restaurant, and you could tell he was nervous about the reservation for 19 about to descend on the place. Hell, we were nervous, so we GTFO. A good spot for drinks and an excellent spot to eat some cro'.  Obligatory Title Pun: Za-GREB a bite here sometime!  Menu Readability: Jittery typewriter typeface on cream. Swell design, but the print job was wretched.  Need to mention: An impressive collection of European beers here. Now open for lunch.  What this place teaches me about myself: Because I am one-quarter Polish, I have a soft spot for the peoples of Eastern Europe. Zivjeli!     _____ [1] According to a girl. Secondary sources needed."}
{"text":"I came to sample Hrvati Bar's famous Croatian burger for the Grid's Burger Week on a Thursday night.  The restaurant was quite tiny with limited seating: a long picnic table in the centre, several high bar tables that seats two, and a few seats at the actual bar. Mel and I arrived relatively early at 6 pm and managed to grab the table by the window.  Hrvati Bar's Burger Week offering was a variation of their famous Pljeskavica with Ontario beef, smoked mozzarella and caramelized onions, all surrounded by a Croatian lepinje (steamed bun). The stand-out component was undoubtedly the steamed bun. I loved, loved, loved its chewy texture, and that was what made the burger so unique as a whole. In addition, the patty was super juicy, and the caramelized onions added a perfect tinge of sweetness. I also loved the use of mozzarella for its gooeyness! It was quite a substantial burger, but I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't help devouring the whole thing! It may not be the most attractive burger, but it was certainly a uniquely delicious one.   By the time we left around 7 pm, the place was packed and people were waiting out the door! Next time, I'll be sure to make a reservation before I come."}
{"text":"Based on our last experience at Hrvarti (late November), we won't be going back.  A family of us stood there, at the door, waiting to be approached.  We wanted to know how long the wait would be.  It was very busy in there, a Groupon voucher was on the cusp of expiring.  Still, we expected to be approached.  I kept inching closer to the bar, and felt everyone's looks.  Too bad neither of the two servers bothered to make any eye contact, or to do the minimum of letting us know that hey, it's busy, and it'll be x min. before a table is available.  Common courtesy.  Eventually, we brought our business elsewhere.  I've been there a few times already, and were looking forward to bringing a visiting family member there that evening.  Food has been good, but sometimes all it takes is just one memorably bad experience to kill any future desire to return.  Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Reservations highly recommended as this place is tiny. It seems extremely popular as there was constant traffic coming in, but unfortunately not able to get a seat. I made my reservations a week earlier but had to change it to 4 people instead of 2 and I think because of that we got bumped to sitting at the bar. Which was annoying at first, but the servers were extremely friendly and funny that it was actually pretty fun to sit at the bar. Another annoying thing is that since the place is so packed, people are just standing by the bar trying to get a seat, so while you're eating dinner or trying to talk to friends people around you don't give a crap that they are bumping their stupid elbows in your back or your head. Just sayin.  As for the food:   pljeskavica - thick, juicy, tasty burger but I wasn't a fan of the bread. It was so greasy, and the taste and texture felt like it should have been a breakfast bread (ie. would have tasted better with butter and jelly) instead of a burger bun. Do they serve the burgers in other buns??   I tried my friend's cevapi. I never had an experience with them before, but they're basically skinless sausages. The ones my friend looked like they were going to be dry and tasteless but it was the complete opposite. The sauces they had along with them were pretty tasty too, only if a little too garlicky. One thing though if you're on a date, do NOT order these. My friend was burping all kinds of sausage smell all night, lol.   Tasted my friend's schnitzel. It was meaty and perfectly cooked. The side beets or whatever they were, were SO SO SO good! I may have to ask for the recipe.   As for the beer: I never tried Croatian beer before (I don't even think I've seen any before!) and it was good. Light and crispy, perfect to eat with burgers and to just sit back and talk to friends with. Very pricey though!! $7.50 or something for a king can. Cheapest was $4 for some nasty tasting Portuguese beer.   Worth trying out! (maybe they'll lower the beer prices once they become more established...here's hoping)"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious -- full of so much flavour and spice. Went to this place because I had coupons and ordered the burger and sausage plate to split with friends.There was SO much food, we couldn't finish it. Seating was limited inside. There is a back patio,...kick back and relax."}
