{"text":"Oh NOOOOOOO! I hate giving a one star, but in this instance I have no choice. I am all about helping the little guys compete on the big food scale but if you're going to compete, ya gotta bring your A-game fella. No one is going to let you into the Stanley Cup Finals for just being a nice team, you have to play hard and earn your spot like everyone else. So lets be clear on that Oak RIdges Asian Deli, I don't hate you, let's use this review as your mid term report card and take what I say as constructive criticism.   This was a take-a-way experience that we should have run-a-way from, the writing (and the dirt) was on the wall (and everywhere else too).   My simple feeling is that if you are paying for food from a restaurant, it's because you want a break at the end of your week from cooking and you trust that said restaurant is going to cook things better and more delicious than you yourself ever could. This is why when food is not prepared properly or prepared at all, there really is no excuse because you are paying a service fee for something that with a little googleing and a little luck you could do yourself at home.  My family usually orders their Chinese fair from another place just up the road but we decided to give this place a chance to convert us. The shop is mostly take out and at first glance it wasn't impressive. The fixtures were outdated and stained with a combination of grease, age and dust, it was dimly lit and smelled rather poorly inside. Yet my mother and I pushed forward and we decided to order a simple Cantonese Chicken Chow Mein to serve on the side of our dinner that night.   At first glance when we got home it smelt delicious and looked wonderful. However, getting past the top layer of noodles I was mortified to find that about 60% of the underlying noodles were not only undercooked but UNcooked. Yes they were still package yellow and hard - in their original bundled shape. We immediately threw out the whole batch concerned that perhaps the veggies and chicken had met similar cooking mastery.  Here's my final word Yelp-fans. Lets not write this place off, but lets give them 6 months to pull up their socks and we will go back appetites in hand.  I'm always about second chances"}
{"text":"Ugh this place.   So a few weeks ago I was super sick and I wanted some soup, so I looked online at this was the only place available around me to deliver, so I figured it can't be that bad and I ordered.  I got a medium hot and sour soup, and chicken wings to round up the order for delivery.  I was told the delivery would take 45 mins, and it took about 2 hours...even though this location is about 5 mins away from my house.   So the soup was delivered stone cold and was basically inedible. I didn't even have more than like three sips of this.   The Chicken Wings were flavourless and covered in like a thick breading. It came with fries which were standard fare I guess.  I'd advise you to just go somewhere else. There's other better places in the area.  Also, what's an Asian Deli?"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst take out experience i have ever had in my life. Ever.  The food was horrible. Words cannot describe how bad it was. Items not even close to their description. Beef that chewed like leather and was clearly old. Protein portions that were embarrassing. Musty flavours. Ingredients that were not just old, but mushy. Things deep fried in oil reused so many times it turned the dish black.   I have never wishes a business go out of business. But this is a diservice to the world.  Shit on a tray is exactly what it is. I had to throw out my entire order."}
