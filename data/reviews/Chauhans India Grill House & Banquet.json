{"text":"Lovely!  India Grill House has some of the finest Indian food I have ever had outside of South Asia. There are many Indian restaurants in Markham and GTA but without a doubt, this place in in my top 3. Decor is okay but the chef's food is just outstanding. Chef roasts hunks of chicken roasted in the tandoor oven until juicy and bronzed, it is juxtaposed with puckery pickled onions, delicious! Even ordinary fish is taken to a whole new level with warm spices and zippy peppers, to make delicious fish curry, which is very hard to get right but is absolutely spot on. I've gotten catering from India Grill House numerous times for office meetings, and I have to say, everyone loves it and ask me where the food is from, most of the people in my office have grown up with Indian food and know it well, but those who don't know Indian food very well are just taken away by India Grill House's food. I couldn't be happier to get Indian food of this calibre in Canada, and will never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Giving them 5 stars simply because I lovvvveee Indian food and they're truly one of the best Indian restaurants in the GTA. I kid you not, I go to a lot of Indian restaurants all over, from Brampton/Mississauga to Scarborough, Markham down to to Queen Street West...Just take whatever mode of transport you can get and come here for the lunch buffet with your friends, fam and coworkers if you're ever in Markham or passing by Markham!!! $11.99 ayce tasty Indian buffet! I think this may be better than my old favourite now. Been coming to Chauhan for 5 or 6 years now. It's not butter chicken, it's butttda cheeken! Just come here once and you'll cum back for more!"}
{"text":"Received a \"buy 1 buffet get 1 free\" coupon in the mail. The BF and i decided to try this place out. We're always up for indian food. We've been big fans of Babu and their awesome butter chicken.   We walked into this place around 5:30-6:00pm. It was absolutely empty. The service was Ok.   but the food was PRETTY GOOD. They had Tandori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Salad, Veggie Samosa, Goat Curry, Veal Curry, Veggie Curry...and even Dessert!   The meat tasted pretty fresh, and the food was all Warm-Hot.   Lunch Buffet is 9.99 and Dinner Buffet is 11.99   So 11.99 for two AYCE buffets...this place was pretty good.   Head's up. They do not accept PRINTED coupons even though it is advertised everywhere online."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today with a friend. Definitely will not be going back due to the overall atmosphere and the attitude received from the staff. It almost felt like they were doing us a favor by serving us.   We were the first ones to arrive at the restaurant. The owner was sitting at one of the tables - no hello, no welcome. What a great way to treat paying customers. We seated ourselves and helped ourselves to food. The food was quite salty and felt like the curry went through several reheats.  Because there was no water jug provided at each table, you either had to flag for a server or wait till they notice your glass is empty and fill up. There were two servers - one male and one female. The female was no-where to be seen. Seems she prefers hiding in the kitchen. The male server was busy chatting up with guest at a particular table with no regard for others. We flagged him for water once, he served it. We flagged him for water again and that is when we got the icy attitude. If you don't want to serve water, then leave a jug at the table, for god's sake. I am sure we weren't the only customer feeling the salt and the need for water. Just ridiculous!  We paid at the counter and promptly left. The female server again showed no courtesy - no thank you, nothing. I am not asking to be treated like a queen. I am just asking for basic courtesy and service.    This is  huge shame especially considering this was my second visit and I brought a friend along with me. It was her first visit. As soon as we left the premise, the first word that popped out was - Boy, I am never going back to that place.    I don't expect things to change given the owner himself shows poor customer service skills.   I also think they put too much salt or MSG in their food. Its been a full two hours since I left and I have already drank at least 5 glasses of water."}
{"text":"This is an okay place for Indian buffet. I like some of their dishes very much like Egg Curry and Mutton Curry. Didn't find anything else special.  They have 5-6 vegetarian options usually. But none of them appealed my palate. Their Naan bread isn't great either. Only 3-stars because of their Egg curry, Mutton curry and plenty of parking outside."}
{"text":"Here for lunch on a chilly Wednesday.  The decor and seating is very nice, and the waiters were very attentive. Not bad at all.  The food variety is only slightly less than India's Taste, by a couple of items. Naan is not as soft and fluffy as their's either. It was crispy and thin here.  The mutton and chicken is much more tender and the flavours are not bad.  However, I prefer the flavouring of the vegetarian options at India's taste more.  You have your usual items: Butter chicken, rogan josh, saag murgh, saag paneer, chili paneer, okra, etc.  Samosas need real work. Small, oily, and not crisp.  They have soups, but I think it is for the one who don't enjoy India food: cream of mushroom, and tomato soup. Salad bar is reasonable, as is the chaat. But there is a lack of fruits. The curries are quite mild, but still flavourful. And the food is hot and fresh.  Dessert was not bad.  Kheer was a bit thick, but delicious. I like the rasmalai here much better than at India's taste.  It was sweet, and not excessively so. The texture was soft, fluffy, and not as tough as at the other restaurant.  Gulab Jamun was what I expected, and since I love these three desserts, I have zero complaints.  The pricing is 11.99 for lunch (used to be 9.99). For the price, seating, atmosphere, is reasonable. But food, I prefer India's Taste for selection and flavour.  Though I must say, I really enjoyed the saag and chili paneer here.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Love the curry goat here. The desire is wonderful. The buffet is the best. The naan is made fresh as needed."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner here with delicious Indian food that really hits the spot- and I'm excited to have good North Indian food in Markham!   It wasn't too busy when we went Sunday night. I tried the harayali chicken (a mint, Coriander marinade) on a sizzling platter, Goan fish curry (DELISH!) and the baigan patiala. They were all pretty good, and the naan was great too.  Totally underrated, and so worth another look at!! I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet.  Restaurant was 1/4 full.  Loved the food.  Tomato and mushroom soups kept super hot.  Lots of variety at the hot table compared to others we have tried.    Enjoyed butter chicken, garlic naan, beef vindaloo, curry goat, tandoori chicken and minced beef kebabs.  Great variety for meat eaters.  As you can tell, we focused on meat dishes but they had plenty of veggie options as well.  Food was kept hot in terms of temperature.  Liked that food taste \"medium spicy\" and not made bland for non-Indian customers.    Service was attentive.  Plates cleared and water refilled quickly.  This place was recommended by an Indian friend.  We will definitely visit again and soon."}
{"text":"I must admit...I don't know much about Indian cuisine, but it doesn't matter...I enjoyed the lunch buffet here.  I got to try a bit of everything which I can't really at an a la carte restaurant because I usually don't know what half the stuff is on the menu.  The staff was very efficient and friendly.  Although there was only one waitstaff, he was really good at what he did.  Saw the chef bring out the food and he was very welcoming too.  The naan was so tasty and fresh when it came out - I had to eat it right away.  They served a bit too much in one shot, we couldn't finish it all and it seems to be a waste.  It would be been better if they served less and on demand so that the naan stays fresh and warm.  Also noticed some of the labels for the dishes were placed incorrectly.  Other than that, I will definitely be returning as soon as next week!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, great service and menu explanation. The atmosphere felt like a wedding reception!"}
{"text":"I find myself coming here quite often lately.  Really like how they did not increase the price during holidays when all the other popular buffets increased their price during the month of December.  $11.99 for all you can eat buffet is a nice deal.  Naan comes out nice and fresh, and they do rotate food selection.  Seating is quiet and comfortable which is a bonus."}
{"text":"This restaurant is mostly Uttar Pradesh based cusine rather than the typically Punjabi north Indian cuisine. The place is set up much like a banquet hall and it is has a good selection of both non-veg and vegetarian dishes. The service is good here. Good to go with family and a group of friends."}
{"text":"I do like the occasional Indian restaurant but the buffet for the event I went to was rather lacking in several departments. Food was a \"best guess\" on what it was as their was no labels and it was not presented well on a whole. It tasted okay but forgettable.   The location itself was a bit dirty. One of the patrons found a card for an event that was there several weeks ago. Staff seemed to not care too much as well. They did their job but nothing more.   There are better places around."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!! The atmosphere is not the greatest, and it often looks like it's closed from the outside, or you're the only people in there, but the food is really great. We got the lamb saag and rogan josh and they were both excellent. I think they also have a lunch buffet, never been, but I'm sure it's delicious. I've always been curious if they have a big lunch crowd, because the dinner crowd is semi nonexistent. But still, great food and worth a try if you're looking for great indian, but definitely don't go for the ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is a branch of Chuhuan which is on Dennison. The food selection isn't as much as Chuhuan, but the quality is just as good.   We went for the lunch buffet and service was excellent."}
