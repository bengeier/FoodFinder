{"text":"Foods ok but the service I done right horrible. More than one occasion they've closed early. When you bowl in a league where the restaurant is located and they close halfway thru the night I really sucks.   Update 3/7/2016 Second week in a row that they closed early."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza and salads on April 24th, 2015 and had delivered to our Hotel, the Candlewood Suites. The delivery arrived but food not delivered to our 2nd room floor as all other restaurants have done for past 3 years. Our pizza arrived and looked good, however it tasted of fish or \"fishy\" and like it has been in contact with anchovies. My sister used to have them on her pizza so I KNOW that flavor. I was having a very special night with my partner, an anniversary, and we chose KingPin as they were open and had Italian Pizza. After receiving we tried to call office but no one answered and open until 1am. We went to their Facebook and they didn't have reviews, so I wrote them a personal letter to describe the pizza sauce flavor and that the salads were wilted with browning lettuce. Not something I would ever want to serve. I would not not said anything but wanted to communicate to them as maybe the management would want to know. I did not hear back in 3 days so contacted Grubhub as well and sent an email to KingPin as listed on website but it was returned immediately as a bad email address. We were hoping they would say they were sorry and give us another shot as we order 3 times a week from restaurants. The driver didn't come to the room and we picked up outside as he was unfamiliar with how to get into this popular extended stay suites. Maybe a bad night for him, too. We forgive but would love to hear from merchant. The pizza did look good, just had to do with flavor and we didn't get near finishing it. We did have to heat in microwave by the time we received but didn't want to complain about that. Maybe this was a one time bad deal. Since no facebook reviews we didn't want to give a negative and have that affect business but it's important to always be honest. Thank you.  Peter Cannice"}
{"text":"This place does NOT deliver!! Even though Yelp, GrubHub, and THEIR own damn menu states they DO deliver. I found out after placing a phone order for delivery  (yes I spoke with someone and confirmed delivery) then calling back to check the status after 1hr had passed to be told they don't deliver"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place with my children tonight and it says they close at 10 on Thursdays so we made the drive out there and when we arrived the open sign was up but as soon as we entered the gal jumped at me and said \"we are closed\" .. really? because everything states that your open...The other worker was cleaning up the ovens and such ao maybe they just wanted to leave early... well please atleast take your sign down, and I run a nearby local business so I feel like it was poor customer service and would be embarrassed if my employees acted that way! I honestly dont think we will return, unfortunately"}
{"text":"Pretty good and decent food for being inside a bowling alley :) we ordered hot wings, pepperoni pizza, and a spaghetti meal (goes with garlic knots and a salad). The cashier did let us know that the pizza will take atleast 30mins so waiting isn't such a problem as long as they let us know ahead of time. I see the cashier was always in the kitchen, maybe needs more workers too so there's someone outside tending to coming customers.. but we'll for sure be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good restaurant with excellent customer service this is not it! They advertise their restaurant as a pizzeria but at 11:30 am you can only order breakfast? To me a true pizzeria should serve pizza before 12:00pm noon. The worst part is that upon requesting a slice of pizza the cashier gave major attitude and wouldn't even make eye contact. I felt very unappreciated as a customer. The food was mediocre which to be honest is expected from a restaurant located inside a bowling alley. The service was slow as can be as well, we watched half the tables food sit on the counter under the heat lamp for 10 minutes and actually had to complain in order for our rude cashier to give us the food. Then behind the cashier i see a gallon of milk so with a hungry one year old I request to purchase a glass and to my shock the cashier said no she will not sell me a glass \"it is only for milkshakes. She then proceeded to tell me to walk a mile down the block to buy some from the grocery store. Seeing as how this bowling alley is hosting a bowling tournament and they know we can not leave I find that extremely rude. As a father when you have a hungry crying one year old it is a borderline emergency to find milk and seeing as they have it at the restaurant you would think they can sell me a glass. They lighting is terrible in the restaurant it's sad a grey looking and the restaurant is dirty as well I was afraid to even let my arms touch the table. On a side note, they do not have any hot sauce in their establishment either on salsa upon request. Overall I do not recommend this establishment to any bowlers that come into the otherwise 4 star bowling alley."}
{"text":"Terrible place, dirty, there is no showcase for the pizza, kitchen guy works with no gloves, cashier is a Mexican gang member. Please save yourself from a food poisoning and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I took a chance on trying the food and atmosphere after being a little concerned on the 4 previous reviews from a long time ago and I am so glad I tried it! The food is prepared by a real chef and the food was excellent! They hand toss their pizzas with a sauce for the pizza created by the chef. The staff and service was excellent! They truly like being a restaurant and it shows in how they care for you as a customer. I will be back for sure! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Since my review that I posted got deleted I'll just post it again. First of all they don't serve lunch until noon when the whole advertisement for this snack bar is pizza. At 11:30 they denied serving us 2 pizzas & said we could only order breakfast. We're here bowling a tournament so I believe they should have made an exception since we've been here bowling since 9am. We all ordered breakfast burritos which come with a side of salsa & I asked if I could also have a side of sour cream. Jasmine told me I couldn't get a side of sour cream with it before I could even offer to pay the 50 cent or whatever fee it was extra. I would have gladly paid for the side no questions asked. She was extremely rude & unprofessional. I then went back to ask if I could purchase a small cup of milk for my child because the fridge behind Jasmine had a gallon of milk in it. She proceeded to roll her eyes & give me attitude. She then said it was only for milkshakes & that I could walk across the street to get milk from the convenient store. Even though the signs on the door when you walk in say \" no outside food or drinks\". I ended up complaining to the manager because at this point I've had it."}
