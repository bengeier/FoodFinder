{"text":"Customer service is excellent here! My family and I felt as if we were coming into their home and they were very nicely welcoming us in.

Loved the vegetarian and pescetarian choices. (Cannot wait to try them all)

My hubby loved the sauce on his kung pao chicken.

The prices are very reasonable.

The restaurant is a tab bit far from where we live, but we would happily drive out of our way to eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"Don't you hate it when you crave a certain food only to have that food taste horrible when you finally get to eat it? I had the General Chicken and my wife ate the Beef & Broccoli. The General was perhaps the worst I've ever eaten (I have been to countless Chinese restaurants across the country and only eat General) and my wife said she would rather have eaten Subway because her beef tasted nasty and even the broccoli was no good. 

This place gets 2 stars because the staff was all very attentive and friendly. Because of the disappointing food though, we won't be going back to this place again."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food.  Growing up in San Francisco most of my life,  I was spoiled with great prices and great food. I moved to southern California and I could not find a good Chinese restaurant for an entire year of living there. I mean not even good,  now I live in Arizona and Yaos is the most amazing Chinese I've had since my childhood.   Great portions, service with a smile,  cleanest restaurant for Chinese food I've been to in years and the food was just excellent. Big portions and great tastes and friendly staff you can't go wrong. I already made a date with the wife to come back jn two days and I'm still eating as I write this."}
{"text":"Best mu shu pork we've found since moving to Arizona! The portions were very generous."}
{"text":"We started with veggie spring rolls which were nicely fried and not too greasy as spring rolls can tend to be at times.  Next up was the wor won ton soup.  It was full of all kinds of veggies as well as pieces of chicken, beef and shrimp.  The won tons themselves tasted a little too ginger-y, but if you get some of the broth in your bite, they taste just fine.  Our main course consisted of Mongolian Beef and Broccoli Chicken.  The Mongolian Beef was sufficiently flavorful, though the dish is a bit deceiving - it looks like you're getting a big plate of meat, but really the meat is served over crispy, white noodles, so it's not as much meat as you think.  The Broccoli Chicken had PLENTY of chicken which was nice because a lot of times with this dish you'll get way more broccoli than meat.

The owner was very sweet and came by a couple of times to make sure everything was OK.  It was also obvious that she knew, or was at least familiar with a few of the other patrons, which is cool because you know that people are repeat diners.

Total bill was about $35 for two of us, with no alcohol.  The menu also features dinner combo specials for $11.50 pp and even cheaper lunch specials.  This is a very casual place that definitely has the potential to become my \"go-to\" Chinese restaurant.  I have to try a few more in the area before I settle on one..."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, the staff is extremely friendly especially the owner.  Our whole family loves going to Yao's and we are always treated like we are family.  The prices are very reasonable and the serving sizes are very large.  Also, for a Chinese restaurant, Yao's is very clean.  Yao's is an excellent value.

We have been coming for the past couple of years and the food quality is consistently delicious.  I strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yao is YUMMY.  I love their hot & sour soup and their Snow Hill Chicken.  Quick service, great food, and fair prices, can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's clean and taste like the food back east. They will even make dishes that are not of the menu."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years since our son told us about it.  The food is awesome, as is the service.  Nice, light interior and always clean!  You'll be seated promptly, given water & offered another beverage if you want one.  I've had many, many dishes on the menu & they're all great!  My husband's fave is the double-pan fried noodles.  My favorite menu item is the pot stickers.  You get 8 big ones, plenty for sharing.  the Snow Hill dishes are great, too.  Great food, great service, & if you go late enough in the evening & if you're a regular - you might score free soup!  Don't miss out on this wonderful neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef chow fun and i got egg noodels instead of real rice noodels. Avoid this place they cut corners. The waiters also speak to eachother in Chinese instead of english to have more private concersations."}
{"text":"Good Chinese place! Friendly staff! Great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Excellent for at a very reasonable price. I order the general chicked extra spicy and orange chicken and it's alway been great. Feed a family of 4 for around $20."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with the YAO. The food is huge and is the best Chinese I've had in the valley. Great bargain and the folks are most awesome. They do everything they can to make you feel at home and they made me feel like family and they're just being themselves. Just an awesome experience you'll keep coming to over and over again."}
{"text":"There should be more than 5 stars!!  1st time. Tried the lunch\" general chicken\" with fried rice.  I've been looking for that ' just right' spice in my Chinese food and I've found it here! !! I will return if my newly preg belly allows!! I'm so pleased to have found a awesome place. Plus it had great yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, great taste and big portions. We have been coming here ever since we moved into the area 3 years ago and the food is always consistent. Kung Pow (no peanuts!) and Curry Chicken are some of our favorite dishes. Order early on weekend nights as they can get really busy."}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've had in a long time. Cashew chicken was wonderful as was the egg roll and crab puffs. Very clean and comfortably busy."}
{"text":"First time here today. Food was good with decent prices. Wait staff wasn't the friendliest, but came to eat. Overall had a good experience and will come again."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials!  I got the Chicken Chow Mein, it was really good.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Chineese food is not easy in the dessert, but this place got it right. Im from New Jersey where take out is great almost everywhere. Yaos has great food, service is just right.

We ordered mongolian beef and was awesome. Chow Mein A+....."}
{"text":"We love Yao's Chinese food. My personal favorite is the sweet and sour pork, but everything I have tried is really good. They also have some great entree deals and combinations at reasonable prices.
I appreciate the kind service and fresh food that I get every time we order from here. Good food, good portions, and good prices."}
{"text":"My Wife has been comingto this
place forthe last 13 years
and never had a bad experience this is how  this place is about !! great people great food
great prices"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese food-they have the best food, service, quality, and affordability. Lunch specials are economical. You get an egg roll, crab puff, soup, and your entree with rice. It's always enough chicken for me to take home and have for lunch the next day. Plus they're efficient. All good things to say about Yao's. Whether we dine in or carry out- we will keep coming back to Yao's."}
{"text":"Great spot for food. Honey walnut shrimp and Singapore noodles are favorites and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"We came because it was close but now we come ALL the time because the food is phenomenal, the prices can't be beat and the owner and staff are unparalleled in service. It's hard to come by special places like this,   it's a must!"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tastes great. I really enjoy coming in for lunch in between work and my appointments. I can order an entree, soup, wonton, and spring roll for less than $7 during lunch time. Kung Pao chicken and the sweet and sour shrimp are great. Yes, this is slightly americanized, but it has been in business for quite some time and the staff and owners are always friendly. They do not hesitate to remember your face and say hello. This is by far my favorite place to take a friend for a quick bite to eat if we want chinese."}
{"text":"Very nice food. Complete value for money. We ordered for King pao chicken, orange chicken,veg chowmin.  Everything was delicious.  Would eat again when visit Chandler."}
{"text":"YAY!  I've found it!  OK, No. It's not authentic Chinese food, but it is authentic American Chinese food.  To be even MORE specific, New York Style Chinese food. I grew up on the east coast and this is what Chinese food is like.  Now onto the business at hand, I'm Chinese and I have to say this place is SOLID...aka...DEEEELISH!  The 2 dishes I always test with are the hot and sour soup and Chicken with Garlic Sauce.  These 2 shows alot of how the chef was trained and can pretty much tell you how the rest of the dishes will be.  And both were mouth watering!  The dinner portion is ginormous, both hubby and I could barely finish 1 dish.  I'm sure lunch portion would be the same, enough to take back to your desk and munch on to survive the rest of the work day cravings.  I totally agree with reviewer #1 for the need to support local business owners. Skip PeiWei and resist the temptation to dine at \"trendy\" Chinese eateries.  EARTH TO ALL: CHINESE FOOD IS NOT TRENDY.  It was never intended to be either.  The fancier the decor, the higher score on the cool-factor, the worse the food is.  I've searched and searched for a hole in the wall serving Chinese food...and I've found it.  This is one is a winner."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the staff was great!!! This the first time I have came and I will be coming many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Chinese food in the east valley BY FAR. I literally have been coming here since day 1, when they opened 11 years ago. I lived across the street and would walk here with my best friend every week after we got our allowance. 

The atmosphere hasn't really changed in the last 11 years (which is completely fine because its nostalgic) but i don't go somewhere for atmosphere. 

Now the food, amazing. I read a review about salt overload; you're getting Chinese food. Why are you so shocked that you feel bloated? Go eat a Thai salad if you don't want to feel like that. And for anyone hesitant, no it does not taste extremely salty. It's perfect.

Anyways, I have not once had something that i was disappointed in. Never. Ever. I'm pretty sure I've had everything on their menu too. My go to is the pork egg fu young lunch special. For $6.95 you get a HUGE portion: two egg patties, a ton of assorted veggies, a bowl of soup (dine in only), fried rice, crab puff, and spring roll. Way better than nasty Panda Express and half the price. Love their won ton soup. So much flavor in the broth. Mongolian beef is awesome. Spicy but in a good way. Beef and broccoli is good. I also had their kung pao chicken. Just so you know, I can't stand KPC, but I definitely like theirs. 

Service is friendly even if you aren't a regular. They're insanely quick during lunch hour. I can be in and out within 30 minutes even if it's packed. 

I can go on and on about this place. I absolutely love it and always bring my friends here. I definitely do not go to any other Chinese restaurant. Love you Yaos!"}
{"text":"As with most Chinese restaurant's I stick with what work's for me on the menu.  I've had good results other than the one time I tried something different on the menu.  That dish was so-so...   The customer service is good and they are friendly although they appear to have an aversion towards refilling people's iced tea if you dine-in.

Not a bad choice if you live nearby or happen to be passing by.  I wouldn't go out of my way for this establishment though."}
{"text":"Kung Pao is great.  Staff is very nice.  Prices are very good.  Hear about it from someone from our church Sun Valley Community Church.  Glad we did."}
{"text":"Fresh, hand made, tastyChinese food.
Every dish in the restaurant is freshly prepared and made daily. I was particularly impressed in the honey walnut shrimp, normally it's rare to find quality shrimp in Arizona, this fresh peeled, hand battered, jumbo shrimp dish beats it's sea side competitors. The chicken lettuce wraps were well seasoned and aromatic, making a pleasant and fulfilling appetizer. They had the most composed and fresh fried rice I've ever tasted. The steamed chicken & vegetables is a rare combination of both healthy and tasty. 

Highly recommend visiting this place."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great Chinese food at reasonable prices. The best dishes are the Walnut Shrimp and the Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We opted for a couple of the dinner combos that came with egg roll, crab wonton, and soup. The only thing I did not care for was the fried rice because there was nothing in it. But perhaps that's a more authentic preparation, I wouldn't know. The staff was very nice and also packed up food we didn't eat for us at the table."}
{"text":"Best Chinese around! They have Hong Kong fried noodle.....best I've ever had any where. Staff is friendly. Lunch specials are inexpensive and give you alot. A must try!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! From the minute we walk in we are welcomed, usually by the manager or one of the two common waitresses. They make sure they remember their regulars. I often get their egg soup on the house and it's great. Food comes out hot and fast! Everything I have had has come out great but I love the Beef Chow mein in particular. The only bad thing I have to say is that its 18 miles from my house but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese take out we've had in a long time. Extremely fresh, hot, and huge portions. Orange chicken!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had excellent customer service the waitresses were very friendly and attentive.  The food on the other hand was bland. I had the orange chicken and it did not taste like orange chicken.  it was likechicken with somesort of sauce on it.  The chicken was tender but the sauce was tasteless, it did not have citrus  flavoring.  We also had fried rice and it was bland. I wouldn't consider this restaurant to be authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Our first visit was last night.  Staff is wonderful, never needed water and they were all very attentive.  Food was well priced.  We had the Kung pao chicken, sesame chicken, orange chicken and another dish.  Everybody loved their meals and I loved the hot and sour soup.  Very clean inside and easy to make plans for another visit...  very soon!"}
{"text":"great food, awesome price!!
If you are a Chinese food lover, you should try this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. Can't say that they have anything unique but if you are in a mood for good American Chinese food, it is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Love their authentic Chinese cuisine. Kung pao is the best I've ever had, eggplant in garlic sauce is a dream and the crispy orange beef is perfection! My kids are all about the wonton soup!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley! The egg rolls are amazing, Mongolian beef fabulous, Singapore rice noodles spicy and yummy, you must try the pupu platter!

We order from here at least once a week and we are never disappointed. This is authentic, real deal food! The service is friendly and always welcoming. Dine-in or carry-out you will not be disappointed. 

The only thing that could give it one more star is if they had the authentic Chinese takeout boxes."}
{"text":"We went with our family on Christmas Eve. Apparently, the entire city of Gilbert thought they would go too! So, the wait to get out table was long and once we were sat, it took a long time to give our order. 
However, once we got our food, it was yummy!  Mongolian beef was spicy, but not too spicy. It was light on the beef though. The chicken fried rice was great! Huge platter! Egg rolls were huge! Others in our party got moogoo guipan, happy family, coconut shrimp and egg flower soup. They all said they were good too! 
We'll have to go some other non-holiday weekend to see how the service is.
   **********************************************
We've been since on any regular day many times! We also went back for Christmas Eve (with a reservation this time!) service has been awesome and the food never fails to be delicious!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here! The staff is always friendly and the food is so good. My favorite dish is the beef lo mein. We live really close and the lunch menu (till 3pm everyday) is only $5-6, it's a great deal for great food!"}
{"text":"Yao's is excellent.  I go there 2-3 times a month and have been for almost two years... and I live 30 miles away.  It is a pleasant atmosphere, not too loud or too crammed, and the owner is usually there talking to customers.  She or the waitress (if she's not there) always make time to chat with me.  Food is pretty good and there's a lot of it, especially on the combo meal.  Crab puffs are great, plus good soups and great shrimp dishes."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a Chinese restaurant of the caliber of Jade Empress since that palace to oriental cuisine closed more than 20 years ago and today we may have finally it.
Yao Fine Chinese Cuisine was a wonderful experience, the staff was friendly, the food was outstanding and most importantly the prices were amazing!
We started with egg rolls which were large, crispy and delicious without being greasy. The hot and sour soup was delicious without the sharp tang of vinegar that is true of so many other Chinese places.
Yao serves a dish called General Chicken (Similar to General Tso Chicken) that is tender chicken served in a slightly sweet yet spicy sauce with crisp broccoli. It was a treat to be sure, but the dish that really was a hit was the Black Pepper Beef. Strips of tender beef cooked with chopped bell peppers, onion, jalapeno peppers, a delicious sauce all sprinkled with loads of fresh black pepper. Oh my!
We enjoyed our meal immensely but it became twice as wonderful when the check came, Wow! Least expensive we've had out in quite some time. You really need to check them out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and ordered a dinner size shrimp with garlic sauce. The ingredients were of good quality and my meal tasted great. The service was quick, my server was friendly, and the restaurant was clean. I will definitely visit again and would recommend Yao."}
{"text":"Yaos is the best Chinese food in the east valley and the prices can't be beat.  Don't miss the hot and sour soup and wash it all down with a tsing tao!"}
{"text":"Left here very disappointed. Came in with the family to eat dinner,but never got to do so. We waited for over 15 minutes, then were finally seated. We were asked what we wanted to drink and never received our drinks. After another 15 minute wait I decided it was enough bad customer service and left elsewhere to eat dinner. We have never had an issue like this until tonight here. It was unfortunate."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, sweet and sour sauce is horrible!  At first I thought it was just a bad day, but no....they don't make the sauce right:(  how do you get sweet and sour wrong??  Runny, like water.  Good thing the is a Frys near by to get some decent bottles sauce.  Come on guys, make it right!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch today with my son. Haven't been here in about 10 years. I had the sesame chicken and as soon as it was set on the table I was glad I stepped back in. For under $7 I got soup, fried rice, sesame chicken, a spring roll and a crab puff. And they were all really good. The service was quick and efficient. The server was very polite and kind. The food was tasty and fresh. Overall a great experience in the under $10 area."}
{"text":"We typically order their Chicken with Broccoli and Pork Fried Rice.  They are able to customize your order without any hesitation and the food arrives steaming hot and fresh.  The food tastes great but I am slightly disappointed in the consistency of the quality of the chicken.  The service is usually super friendly; however, one time they charged my card twice and argued with me about it when I returned to the restaurant and showed them my bank statement the next week.  I had to wait for the owner to drive to her house where she keeps her copies of the credit card receipts.  She eventually reimbursed me but I was furious that she wasted my time and I had to sit at the restaurant waiting for her to go home, and then she barely took accountability for the mistake."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place a few months ago, and WOW! The food is always fantastic and fresh and the prices are much lower than others. Whether we pick up to go, or eat in, we are always treated amazing. Wouldn't trade the service or food for anything. I am about to move in a couple weeks, but will still make the extra drive to keep coming back to this place. Check it out folks!"}
{"text":"These are the reasons that I would never go back:

#1  Bad service!!!   The waitress has attitude. 

#2  Bad Food!!!   Ordered Beef & Broccoli.  Very poor quality beef...I could chew on one piece. Had to spit out, spunky like soaked in baking soda water.

#3  Sweat Box!!!  Thermostat set at 78 degrees...dining room was warm."}
{"text":"Really good.   Very friendly and we get take out once a week

Pork noodle soup, teriyaki chicken, spring rolls, Singapore noodles and beef and broccoli are great

Huge portions"}
{"text":"Fine go to Chinese in the Gilbert area- especially compared to their competitors.  Portions are extremely large- so for takeout it is more than enough to split platters."}
{"text":"We have been going here sundays after church for many years best food best service best value absolutely can not be beat!!"}
{"text":"Such a good deal! Love the kung pao chicken and the hot and sour soup. Fast service and the owner is super friendly."}
{"text":"The place is very small and not very busy but the service is great. Filled my wine glass to the TOP!"}
{"text":"Always good Chinese for the best price around. Often a nice quiet spot for families that don't want to wait forever. Get the honey walnut shrimp & egg flower soup."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Simple, clean dining area with plenty of room. The girls are fabulous here, very friendly and professional. The food is outstanding!! The vegetables are always fresh and crisp. The food is amazing. Have been here several times and will continue. Prices are fair too, check them out!!"}
{"text":"Great food that is reasonably priced. The server we had was a \"Hoot\"...able to joke around. Our go to Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Yum!!  First time there tonight and it reminded me of the places back home in Chicago!  Especially the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife got take out one night, we were not to impressed it was ok. There is a minimum $ amount for takeout so we had to order more than we really wanted. To top it off I woke up at 2AM sick as can be with liquids coming out of both ends. Needless to say I havnt/won't be back again. I would say 3 stars but when I wake up at 2am puking I have to say 0."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing great like the reviews reflect. I was telling someone how difficult it was to find good Chinese food locally and she started raving about this place. 
We have ordered a take out 3 times and each time I'm disappointed we didn't drive a little further to our favorite Chinese restaurant. 
I like the way they package the sweet and sour sauce separately from your main dish so that it's not soggy by the time you get home.  Also, it's still very hot by the time we get home and it's a good 15-20 minutes away.

My biggest gripes: 
*Salt overload. Holy Cow! Every time. The day after I eat here I am so bloated I can hardly fit into my clothes let alone get my rings on my fingers.
*I'm funny about my meat. The pork in the fried rice is so fatty, I pick it out. I justify this because the fat has to add flavor during the  cooking process.
*Back the meat. I took a bite of sweet and sour chicken last night and the chicken was nothing but gristle. It was so disgusting I had to spit it out.
*The chicken in the sweet and sour tastes a little like fried shrimp/ or has a slight seafood taste. I was wondering if they fry all their meats in the same oil? 

If you were in a pinch and 'needed' Chinese food, you could consider going here, but it's not my favorite."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food- my husband and I come here every time we crave Chinese food. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the service is the best. For about $6 you get lots of food."}
{"text":"This is our family's go to Chinese spot! The orange chicken is made with white chicken meat and they will customize any meal for you! 

They have great priced lunch specials and the staff is always super friendly! The service is always fast. 

Order the crab puffs they're really addicting!"}
{"text":"I would say that Yao's serves up the best Lo Mein I've ever had with a nice flavor from a hot wok.  We have had several of their chicken dishes and it never disappoints.  The mu shu pork (sp?) it also very good and has excellent flavor.  I also like how they leave their veggies slightly crisp which gives them a great texture with the noodles and rice.  I have not dined in yet there as my house is so close but the dining room is rather bland looking.  It does look clean however."}
{"text":"Yao Chinese is our favorite Chinese food restaurant! The food is authentic and amazing, the owners and staff are friendly and always make us feel at home. The restaurant is always clean and smells delicious. We love coming here and everyone that we have brought with us, loves it too!"}
{"text":"After reading all these \"wonderful\" reviews and having a hankering for chinese food we decided to try Yao out. We regretfully ordered somewhere near $60 worth of take-out for the 4 of us tonight. Long story short all of the food was very bland, the shrimp were NOT deveined and FULL of poop, the chicken in the kung pao and chicken chow mein pieces were tasteless and scarce which I'm assuming was because the few pieces included were HUGE, the crab puffs were SWEET and lacking \"crab meat\"? Why I'll never know, the beef skewers we outright NASTY! Tasteless and tough, the shrimp fried rice was bland and full of bean sprouts which was very unappealing in itself. Our food was also lukewarm and it wasn't from the 1 minute drive home. I will give them 1 start for friendly customer service. Quite grankly I feel that some of these reviews may be fake or paid. If you are craving chinese I would do further research before coming to this place. I honestly feel like we should have just drove to panda express instead that way we at least know what we were expecting. Now I'm out of $60 and all 4 of us are out of a dinner as we refuse to consume any more than the few bites to sample the food. I forgot to mention that after 2 bites of my shrimp fried rice I ended up extemely nauseated and vomited several times. If you do decide Yao you have been forewarned."}
{"text":"We've come here for a few years now. Good priced food and good tasting. Friendly service. We enjoy getting the dinner combinations...PuPu platter is a goI'd appetizer to share."}
{"text":"It's great food, much better than the average Chinese restaurant of the Phoenix area.  The only one in Arizona that is better is Lucky's in Tucson, but that's as much for location and atmosphere as it is for food.  

The other commenter about the \"soup nazi\" staff was right on, and I was so amused by this that I will go back again and again.  I had my order in a message on my phone.  I was looking at my phone when I was ordering at the counter.  She told me I was too busy...  that I shouldn't be texting...  I tried really hard not to laugh, because she was dead serious.  It nearly took me back to the 1970s and Goff's restaurant in Dallas.  

Four stars for the Snow Hill Chicken and an extra star for the admonition over \"texting\"."}
{"text":"We go here almost every other Sunday after church. I've tried most of the dish and so far no complaints. My children's favorite dish is the orange chicken. The best part is that they serve you wonton,  egg drop, or  sweet and sour soup first. Very friendly!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. Lunch combos are cheap and decent. Love their General Tsaos chicken and Garlic chicken!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 2 years now and we love it! It's so hard to find a good NY style Chinese place in AZ and this comes close. We always get the twice cooked pork, general tso, sweet and sour pork it's perfect every time. They have great lunch specials and their positions are very generous!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and awesome service. They're chow mein and egg flower soup are delish"}
{"text":"Really impressed. My husband and I had a date night at home and wanted to try this place for carryout due to the reviews. As usual with a place new to us, we ordered WAY too much. We know this because they gave us four fortune cookies. Ha! The gal on the phone was professional, friendly and repeated the order back. Just wish they had given total cost over the phone.

We ordered generals chicken, shrimp fries rice, honey walnut shrimp, crab puffs and egg rolls. This ginormous feast was ready for pickup in 15 min...just enough time for me to drive there. The order was ready when I came in and it was well wrapped for transport (look at pic). They had it taped down so it wouldn't spill out in the car. They must have known that I am a wild driver. The woman behind the counter was prompt with service, organized and even started a conversation. 

Food was still warm when we sat down to eat. Even the puffs and egg rolls were still crispy! The food had a lot of flavor and the ingredients seemed fresh and were well-prepared. Best honey walnut shrimp that I have found in the valley and a very generous portion. The accompanying steamed broccoli was abundant and cooked to perfection (slight crisp. Ohhh yeah!). The puffs were pretty good but slightly too sweet for me...and I like sweet-ish (Great Wall's are still best). I could do without the egg roll, as it didn't have the chunks of cabbage and veggies that we usually prefer. It was very greasy and had more of a mincemeat/mush consistency. 

Hubby loved the fried rice and came with tons of shrimp. Usually places are stingy with shrimp but both of our dishes gave you more than your money's worth. Thanks, Yao!   I really liked the General's but my husband thought that the breading was a but too dense and chewy. We both agreed that the chicken was good quality white meat. Nothing is worse than Chinese food with a grisly mystery meat in place of your chicken.  Pleasantly surprised. 

Between the service, portion size, quality & flavorful ingredients and masterful preparation, we will definitely be back, even though Great Wall is much closer. Do it!"}
{"text":"Pan Fried noodle and Beef fried rice were delicious! Slow to greet when I walked in for take out but they were really nice once they got around to helping me."}
{"text":"For Chinese food this place is pretty good. Inside lacks a bit decor but what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant. They can accommodate large groups, and by large groups in talking around 12-16! Yes we had a group of 16 at this place. Some fav menu items: sesame chicken, honey walnut shrimp, and house fried rice. We've been here almost once a month since July. And the ladies know us pretty well now."}
{"text":"We ordered from Yao Fine the day before Thanksgiving to have something quick to eat without dirtying the kitchen. We have tried our fair share of Chinese restaurants in the Gilbert area but haven't found \"the one\" yet - but our search maybe over.  We ordered the walnut shrimp, general's chicken, shrimp chow mein and hot and sour soup - we also had the egg rolls and a crab Rangoon.  

Everything was tasty and the walnut shrimp, egg roll (which was huge), Rangoon and generals chicken are probably the best I have ever had in Gilbert. The shrimp chow mein was also good, and was a huge serving, but my husband would have liked more shrimp so next time we will add extra. The only thing that was at all disappointing was the hot and sour soup - while tasty it didn't have a very good vegetable to broth ratio but I don't know if that was a one time occurrence or not so I will try it again sometime to see.

Lastly, the fact that they don't deliver makes me sad - but only because if they did I would exclusively order from here. But on those days when we can order and pick up we will definitely order from Yao Fine!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Chinese food restaurant for several years.  I must admit most of the time it is for take out.  And everything is fresh and tasty.  I am from California where good Chinese food is plentiful, and Yao's is my favorite.  By the way the people that work there are always friendly and even stayed open late for me one time when I ordered on the way home and arrived there at 9:15 pm.  Super place!!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to the East Valley a few months ago, (heck, really, ever since I moved to The Valley 5 years ago), I've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant with fresh-tasting food and a more authentic feel (to me, authentic is as simple as using traditional Chinese vegetables like bok choy instead of zucchini)!

I believe I've found such a really good Chinese restaurant in Yao's.  And not only must the food be good...other restaurants got rave reviews on the food...but so too, the service.  Because good food can be soured by poor service.  Typical in some of these \"authentic\" Chinese restaurants: non-communative waitstaff or those who don't care.  Yao's was different...right from the friendly greeting when we entered to the cheerful waitress who stopped by every so often to check on us (granted, it was only late afternoon on a Sunday).

But the food was very good, too. Following the lead of other Yelpers, I ordered the egg roll.  It was indeed nice and crispy, not greasy on the outside, containing slightly crunchy, flavorful veggies and other ingredients inside.  It definitely tasted like they made it, not the common freezer-to-fryer ones found elsewhere.

The won ton soup in a cup was a small serving, mostly broth with a little shredded cabbage and stuffed wontons at the bottom.  Very light, not substantial, really just enough to warm you up a bit and move to the next course.

The moo shoo shrimp was good: all pancakes with contents were pre-wrapped by the kitchen, with hoison sauce on the side.  They stayed moist that way without crumbling or getting too soggy--just perfect.  Veggies were flavorful, as was the flavoring inside.  Shrimps were reasonable size, plump and tasty.

I definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Singapore rice noodles was ridiculously flavorful; Spicy to the point where you could still taste all of the masterfully assembled ingredients. I had it to go and it was packed into the box to the point of barely closing. 

Also had the beef Chow fun which was also top notch. Plenty of veggies, savory beef that was cut to the right portions, and also packed until the box could barely close.

Friendly staff that helped me with my custom order.

Food did not take long and was a seamless process for checkout. 

Definitely coming back, by far my favorite in the
 Chandler /Gilbert/Mesa area."}
{"text":"Ordered sesame chicken dinner combo and the price is great for what you get. 2 cream puffs, 1 egg roll, egg drop soup and fried rice. Everything tasted very good except the fried rice wasn't good but it didn't bother me, I still ate it ."}
{"text":"First time here. I can't believe I never ate here and I live down the road. Absolutely the best I've had in along time.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"First time here today, went there for take out, there was no minimum order required.  I had the black pepper beef.  It was really good, better than I had expected.  This will be my new place for Chinese food!! The lady working the counter was real nice and helpful pick out something.  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been visiting Yao for several years.  The food is good and the price is very reasonable.  I have to say that Shirley, the owner, is what keeps us coming back.  She always greets her customers with a warm smile and friendly \"hello\".  I also love this place because it reminds me of my first experience with Chinese food as a kid.  Ironically Yao offers a nice break from the PF Chang-style Asian cuisine in both it's simplicity and its price.

I have noticed that on busy nights the staff can get a little backed up with the influx of To-Go orders, but I've always been very please with the service level and attentiveness of the wait staff.

Can't say enough nice things about this place as it's a real favorite."}
{"text":"The Hot and Sour soup is perfection. The right balance of heat and sour. The steamed dumplings were moist and tasty. I do wish the sauce that comes with it has more spice. The food tastes fresh, nice textures and plenty to pick from on the menu. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is they don't deliver. It's still worth the short drive tho!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  Went for lunch yesterday with my GF.  This place is .5 miles from our house and we were in a rush for lunch since we got detained at home by a late contractor doing some work.  So we decided to give this place a try.  I am a stickler for good Cantonese food and was not expecting much.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the food and the pricing, which were both pretty good.  We had sesame chicken (I know, I know -- this is white people's Chinese food, but my GF loves sesame chicken) which was very good.  We had fried tofu with assorted veggies in a brown sauce which also was very good.  I ordered Mongolian beef which was good and it was served over a bed of deep fried mai fun, which I really don't care for, but it was OK.  And lastly, I ordered beef chow fun which was good too.  The noodles were thinner (not the width but the thickness) chow fun noodles which were OK but I like the thicker chewier kind.  But all in all, the dishes were good and the prices appropriate @ $8.95 per dish."}
{"text":"I was looking to switch up our normal Chinese takeout with something new and Yelp! Led me over to Yao. I will say it was not as good as Great Wall Chinese but it was pretty good. Egg rolls here were very good, Peppered Beef and Kung Pao chicken were ok a little much on the greasy side but hey what do you expect when it comes to Chinese takeout. Fried rice was pretty disappointing as there really wasn't much to it. Overall Yao was a solid 3 stars. Not the best Chinese food and definitely not the worst"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the service. Every experience eating at Yao is enjoyable. The first visit we felt welcomed and now as regulars we feel like friends. Every dish I have tried is delicious. Great lunch specials. A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite local Chinese diner. I have tried most in the area and always end up camparing to Yao....and going back to Yao.
Food is great. Staff is friendly. Still at the top of my list after several years."}
{"text":"Yao's is Yum.

Food was yummy and the price is right.  I had the General's Chicken - not spicy and more like an Orange Chicken, but, the presentation was great; a good portion and a great price for under $8.  My wife had the Lobster Sauce dish - it was yummy.

Our church went there for lunch; probably about 20 of us.  Yao's didn't miss a beat - got us all taken care of and the staff was very friendly.  We had gotten there just a hair before noon.  When we left at 1:00-ish, there was a wait - busy and popular place.

This is a winner; one of the better local Chinese places in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We love this place. Friendly service, a little slow when busy, but the food is great and worth waiting for. The place is neat and the price is reasonable. Would recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today. You get a ton of food with the lunch specials. All five in our party got something different and we all liked our food. We will be back. Only negative was the smell of the restaurant when you first walk in the front door. Not sure what it is but doesn't smell good. However, this was minor when compared to the food. We will be back."}
{"text":"We come here once in awhile for the lunch combos.  

We usually get the orange chicken since the kids love that sweet & sour flavor with the crunch.  It's way too sweet for my taste, so I order the beef broccolli or egg foo young.  I'm not too crazy about the egg roll filled with the hideous cabbage with nutmeg.  

The good thing about this place is at least they don't have the same brown sauce for everything like most Americanized Chinese restaurants.   The service is always good.

It's a good place to have inexpensive family lunch!"}
{"text":"My wife and I hadn't been here in quite a while. Came back for a quick Sunday night dinner out and were surprised at the quality we had been missing elsewhere. Service was friendly and fast, no wait, and food came out quick and super hot! The soup is some of the best we've ever had and the egg roll was fantastic as well. The pancakes on my Moo Shu Chicken were just perfect, not too thin and not too heavy or soggy. Tsing Tao beers we ice cold and only $2.50! Don't miss this place for a Chinese night out."}
{"text":"I was feeling Chinese so i chose this place from the yelp reviews. Glad I did. Service was on the spot & the food was great! It was a pretty inexpensive meal in top of that. Looks like I'll be adding this place to my musts......"}
{"text":"Combination plates for dinner hit all of the needs, salty, sweet, filling and tasty. Order regularly, never a hiccup."}
{"text":"YES! We finally found an excellent Chinese restaurant nearby! This place is large, clean and bright, with very good and really fast service. Prices are the lowest we've seen for this kind of place. Now, the food... wonderful! Wife had sesame chicken (filled one of those large oval plates) and each piece was large, juicy and tender, and there wasn't even one of those little bits of mostly fried breading on the plate. My combination fried rice was also excellent (again, filled the plate), and the sweet and sour sauce was nice and thick and really tasty. Had a good Chinese beer for $3.50, and water as well as pop comes in a 16 oz glass - huge! As you would expect about a good Chinese restaurant, we stuffed ourselves and still brought at least half of the food home. Hey, if you live in Gilbert or eastern Chandler and you're going anywhere else, you're going to the wrong place. This is it!"}
{"text":"Really terrific family Chinese food.  Very friendly and hospitable staff.  I stop by for lunch a couple of times a month and have never been disappointed.  For about $6 you get soup, egg roll, crab puff, fried rice and your choice of entry.  I usually opt for the egg foo young, decent egg foo young is surprisingly hard to find in the Valley.  Very tasty sauce, crisp snow peas, mushrooms, carrots, water chestnuts and tender chicken.  Two good sized patties.  Really good food at a really good price!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. This is the spot if you're looking for good chinese food. Service is really fast and efficient"}
{"text":"Good American Style Chinese food. (Is that a paradox?)  We have been coming here since they opened. They make Chow Fun w/ Black Bean Sauce for me, even though it is not on the menu. Sometimes, if you are lucky , you can the Gai Lan with Oyster Sauce.  

The only bad experience / horror story, was the two and a half hours we spent waiting for food on Christmas Eve. (No really!) @#$%!  It was like a crazy Chinese Black Friday. I will never do that again,..."}
{"text":"Friend and I got our nails done together next door and saw the sign for their lunch specials and decided to give them a shot.  Lunch specials are like $5.50 and include soup and egg roll.  Your typical selections, but they were nice enough to let us both substitute chicken for the beef in the \"beef and broccoli\".  The food was quick and tasty.  For the price, can't be beat.  I'm sure we'll be back when we get our nails done next door again."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little restaurant with great service and good food.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that from time to time we do experience inconsistencies in food quality.  Most of the time it is good."}
{"text":"Love Yao!  Food is delicious  and affordable. Staff is attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Attentive service.  My favorite is the vegetable mu shu. It comes with a great variety of veggies.  My only complaint is that the \"crepes\" seem more like tortillas but maybe I just don't get it...Are Chinese crepes supposed to be like tortillas? The egg flower soup is really good too."}
{"text":"We chose this place because of its location and high ratings.  Our new study group was located just a mile away, nice!  Friendly staff and management, clean looking as was also the bathroom.  We hadn't eaten Egg Foo Young in quite some time so ordered it with pork.  It was better than excellent, large portions appear to be the rule here.  My wife and I felt it was one of the best we have ever eaten.  Next we ordered from the vegetable menu, egg plant in spicy garlic sauce and added sliced pork (Additional $2 charge) and were blown away by the quantity of meat added!  It was delicious but the pieces of tender flavorful egg plant were twice the size they should have been, losing them a half point off their near perfect score, and therefore a 4 star rating as Yelp doesn't score half points.  Yes I will return again and, yes I will tell my friends and family about their great oriental food."}
{"text":"They have the best chinese food in Gilbert!

I am addicted to their garlic chicken and szechawn chicken. Prices are incredibly fair and they provide excellent service.

So thankful to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Walking in the restaurant it looks super cute and diner like, I love the friendly staff that greets me when I walk in. It always smells good and the atmosphere of the place is casual and comfortable. There's a cute little Buddha watching you on the front counter as you pick up your to-go order that I always love to see. 
   I've been coming Yao since I moved to Chandler and its my favorite Chinese food place. My go to order is the Singapore rice noodles, it has so many fresh ingredients in the actual entree, things like shrimp, pork, egg, bell pepper, carrots and more. The noodles are super thin and delicate and I love them. 
   I tell my friends about this place all the time and I beg them to go because I love it here. I've never once had a bad experience and I think everyone should try this restaurant at least once if they live in the chandler-gilbert area. The food is always prepared fast and fresh and you get a lot for a low price, overall Yao has good quality food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Excelent fue, fresh taste, I love how they bread they chicken. Service was great too, the staff is very attentive"}
{"text":"Yao has become our favorite Asian food restaurant in the Chandler/Gilbert area. Food is extremely consistent and fresh tasting. Plenty of vegetables in the dishes that are cooked correctly and not mushy. Spicy entres are excellent and I feel are much fresher and healthier tasting than our previous regular stop. (Pei Wei) Top it off with very friendly service and reasonable prices and I'm kind of shocked they aren't busier."}
{"text":"I was craving chow mein and Yaos reviews were great. 
Excellent attentive and friendly staff to all their patrons. 

The crab rangoons and sweet and sour sauce was the best I've ever had,  it was so incredibly yummy.  

The beef chow mein was good, I probably won't order it again as I didn't care for the meat. The quality of it was poor and tasted funny.  The noodles were great though.  

I will definitely be back and will try something different. Prices were so very reasonable."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious Chinese food.  Reasonably priced for the quality of food you get.  

You know the \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfeld?  If you try to switch out the spring roll for an egg roll on their lunch special, you'll meet their version."}
{"text":"First time here with my husband since we've moved to Arizona we've been trying to find a good Chinese restaurant and we came across this one on the way to go eat somewhere else, it was a really great experience food was great came out hot staff was very welcoming and nice, The owner greeted us came to our table and helped us with the menu and also gave my husband a complementary egg flower soup on the house, we highly recommend this Chinese restaurant and we will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Always get takeout from here and the food is very good. I can't say the \"best\" because I've had the best in Gulfport, MS. This is my place though for Chinese in AZ. Pork Fried Rice; Lo Mein; Sweet & Sour Pork/Chicken/Shrimp; Twiced Cooked Pork and Sesame Chicken are always great choices. Kung Pao Chicken can be spicer, but you can always ask for spicer and I do wish the chicken was diced instead of sliced. Nice inside, but actually never ate inside just takeouts, but busy usually during the rush hrs. Makes me hungry just writing this review!"}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot when my family lived in Gilbert, so I'm surprised I never wrote a review for this place. It definitely gets five stars, because the food is delicious, and staff are all really nice, and the place looks great. I've never had a bad experience here. The servers are all warm and friendly. They greet us when we come in, and often stop by during the meal to check on us. Portions here are nice and filling, and you get a lot for a great price. I still often come here for lunch or dinner whenever I am stopping by in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Having lived in the NY & NJ area for 30 years I've become spoiled with good Chinese food. Last night my girlfriend and I decided to try this place in Gilbert. The menu was extensive and the prices looked great. We were shocked when I went to pick it up as to the large portions . The General Chicken was soft and not over cooked and the potstickers were hot and tasty. 
Definitely the best Chinese Food I've tasted since I've been here. I can't wait to order again!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Came in for the egg foo young, and it was fantastic. Also tried orange chicken, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, and was impressed by all. Clean, fast, great service. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant may not look much but it is TOP NOTCH!! The food is so delicious and fresh. And the portions are enormous with very reasonable (cheap) prices. The service is perfect - very very speedy and the women are so sweet and the best part is they remember you every time you come in. They remember what you like to eat and many other little details. I feel like a VIP every time I go in. I highly recommend this restaurant. The menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood find!  Try the triple- Chicken, pork and shrimp. Kung Pao chicken is very good, too. Quick, good service and great food. You get more than you can eat for about $10/plate. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing food and service I recomnend chicken and vegetables with garlic sauce."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for my favorite Chinese Food restaurant in the East Valley.  I must go to this restaurant at least once a month.  It is so good and it is around the corner from me.

The lunch specials are an amazing deal and the dinner portions are huge.  My favorite is the chicken & broccoli, house fried rice, sesame chicken, and the egg rolls.  Let me go back to the egg rolls for a minute.  They are some of the best you can get.  I think I went there once and got just egg rolls and rice.  Yep...they're that good.  I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deals.  Prompt, friendly service.  The sauce on the Kung Pao was different from other Kung Paos I've had, but good.  Veggies we're cooked just right.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight.  It's the day after Christmas, and I am not the only one in the area sick of the Christmas feast.  I walked in to find a very busy restaurant, but service was still good.  There were many people working hard, never skipping a beat it seemed.  I ordered cashew chicken and sweet and sour shrimp, with fried rice.  Pretty delicious.  The shrimp were a good size and the cashew chicken was a huge portion.  Good flavor and well worth the wait.  I will definitely be trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Good food! Loved the sweet and sour chicken. Egg drop wasn't my wife's favorite but their fried rice and wonton was awesome!"}
{"text":"Yaos is good, everyday Americanized Chinese food. Soup is good. Mongolian beef, lettuce wraps, house noodles are all favorites. Service is attentive & food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"This place has some very tasty food. We had the sweet and sour pork which was amazing believe it or not. The pork was lean and tender and the coating was crunchy. The Mongolian Beef was very tasty as well. The best part of the meal was the combination chow mein. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food we have had in the East Valley.  Always delicious and consistent.  It's very reasonably priced too.  We have been several times and tried different items and not had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The lost me as a customer tonight. My wife and I have been here many times in the past because they were in a convenient location and served better than average gilbert area Chinese food. I have to say that their service has been quick throughout the multiple years we have dined there. 

Tonight we arrived 30 minutes before closing and were turned away because they close at 9pm. First of all, what restaurant closes at 9pm on a Friday? Second, what restaurant turns away loyal customers a half hour before closing? Most restaurants will seat you up to closing time and let you finish your meal after they close the door.

Life is too short and there are way to many good restaurants in the area to put up with this. They are off of our dining list."}
{"text":"First time in today for a early dinner, been meaning to give this place a try and so glad we did. 

Service was amazing, my drinks were always full, they answered all my questions about the menu, and my daughter loved our servers as well! Brought her a share plate and lollipop, giving her special attention, which was cute.

The atmosphere was cozy, and plus a lot of booths.

The food was great, and for a great price. Dinner specials included soup, egg roll, 2 crab puffs, a side of fried rice, and your choice of listed entrée. ( but for a $1 more you can do any entrée) it was soo much food. My daughter and I shared, and had food to bring home. The eggrolls were enormous. We had beef and broccoli and the kept the sauce on the side for us. My only critic is no peas and carrots in the fried rice ( but this is a personal preference because I love extra peas in my rice, weird I know). In all I had a great experience, would recommend it to friends, and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff make this a restaurant you want to visit.  I have not been here for lunch, but dinner is always good.  As a bonus, the dining room is bright and clean which makes the dining experience better."}
{"text":"Dinner specials are nothing special! They are pretty expensive and the portions are not anything better than the lunch sizes. I will be back for lunch but I will not be back for dinner. (Also the lady didn't package our left overs like usual)"}
{"text":"We go here for lunch on the weekends fairly consistently and order from the \"Lunch Menu\".

The food is consistently delicious!
I love the Won Ton soup, and the spring roll that comes with the meal.
They gladly substitute white or brown rice for the fried rice.
And the staff is always smiling and pleasant and swift!

Of course this is NOT authentic chinese cuisine...but that's not what I want!
I enjoy getting a good sized meal, with unlimited refills on my drinks for me and my lady and spending well under $20.

You'll have to ask for chopsticks, but they have them :)"}
{"text":"Why 1 star? You insist extra spicy again and again, you bring the box home on carry out and dont see a single spec of pepper in it..Hot Oil is not extra spice..Cook the damn food with Pepper..that is what extra spice means. Read the order before you cook..some of us really eat hot stuff..like thai pepper in soy sauce.."}
{"text":"Really good food and very reasonably priced. we loved everything except their fried rice, it tasted like brown rice and soy sauce, which was disappointing since it's one of my favorites at Chinese restaurants. Other than that everyone was very nice and polite even with the language barrier, place was clean and they were very quick to get our drinks, food, and bill since we were in a hurry. All in all pretty good place."}
{"text":"Been going here for a couple years, and I love it. The owners know my family and I well. The food is tasty the atmosphere not bad. Their orange chicken and egg fu young are top notch!"}
{"text":"Another lunch and I asked them to cook the vegs a little more which they were glad to do and they were perfect. I printed out my 1st review and left it with them. We don't have a 4.5 rating so I will ask them to put a few peas and corn in the fried rice so I can give them a 5 star review. Love the egg rolls and my wife gave me half of hers so all in all, a great late lunch."}
{"text":"I'm Asian and love authentic, down home Chinese food but sometimes I get the hankerin' for good old Americanized Cantonese food like at Yao.  The owners are super nice and the place is clean and fast and the portion sizes are out of control.  Also $2 Tsingtao Beers anytime!!  It's easy to drive by and never feel like stopping in but the the place is great.  Don't Panda, Don't Pei Wei, Don't PF - go to Yao and support local, hard working folks."}
{"text":"Food is terrible, beef was boiled with a gelatinous flavor, would not recommend and won't go back. I've tried this restaurant 3 times ordering 3 different dishes- outcome? FAIL!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place after living in the area for years and driving by it tons of times. After hearing about the lunch special I decided to stop in today to give it a shot. You get a ton of food for $6 and the General Tso was great."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up dinner here last night - ordered pan-fried noodles, chicken with broccoli and fried tofu with veggies...  Taste was not bad.  But everything looked and tasted pretty much the same.  Nothing as special as the other reviews would suggest.  Would not bother to try again..

Also, they packed the food in a cardboard box.  I hate it when Chinese restaurants do this since the sauce inevitably ends up spilling out, seeping through the box and ultimately ending up on the seat of your car.  Use plastic bags, people!  If you hate the environmental impact, make them biodegradable and charge a few extra cents!!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food at a reasonable price, with a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stoped in for lunch the other day, i have been here several times before.  Service was great as always. This  time I ordered the sesame  chicken.  It was very  good.  Great taste.   And fresh.  This place  is my go to  sit down chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we tried Yaos. We ordered the crab puffs, orange beef, teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice. Everything was very good other than the teriyaki chicken which was  a bit on the bland side. The food was ready for pick up in 15 min and the staff there was very friendly. Maybe one these days they'll offer delivery but it's still worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Dinner specials come with soup, eggroll, and crab puff. Big portions! Service is a little slow/ lacking."}
{"text":"I LOVED the customer service I got here! You can't beat it! I chose Yao because of it's Yelp and the fact that they were still open and willing to serve me a to go order at 8:45 pm. As I waited for my food, the women were both super friendly and genuinely interested in who I was. I felt like my 15 minute wait just flew by! The food was pretty dang good and definitely decently priced! I will for sure be going back to Yao!"}
{"text":"Very bad Wor Wonton soup no wonton skin just starchy dough pockets with very little meat stay away from this soup no shrimps nor slices of pork . I went to another Chinese Restaurant about four miles from them and got a good ole' fashion Wor Wonton soup the way I've had it for years."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Food was good and service was OK. Their lunch came with the soup, spring roll, crab wanton, fried rice and entree. Soup, roll, Rangoon and entree was pretty tasty. Fried rice could have been better. Portions are very generous. Totally worth a try!"}
{"text":"Love the sweet and sour pork and crab puffs yum yum yum.  New to the neighborhood and I think we found our favorite chinese food!  Impressed with the food.  Can't wait to order the chow mein next time."}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews, I was sure I was going to give this place a 4 or maybe even 5 stars. Weeelllll nope. So I was in the mood for Chinese food and this place was close, I thought I'd try it. I ordered the sesame chicken combo that came with fried rice, 2 crab puffs, and an egg roll. After I left out the restaurant (ordered to go), and went to my car, something told me to check my food. I check the bag with the puffs and roll and behold, a hair hanging from my crab puff. Should have taken a picture but with it being 120 degrees outside, I didn't feel like doing all that, and I just wanted to go back in and get new ones. Anyway the sesame chicken tasted great. The chicken was nice and hot. It wasn't chewy. Actually had a slight crunch which is what I like, and had a good flavor. The fried rice on the other hand looked and was dry, and was not fresh like the chicken was. It's really debatable as to whether or not I'll return."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a real need for some spicy Chinese food so we thought we would give Yao's a try since it was close to home and our previous 'goto' Chinese restaurant had closed.  We were really impressed by the dine-in experience!!  HUMONGOUS portions mean any one meal will definitely serve as a well balanced meal for two!  Egg rolls were fantastic!!  Crab Puffs/rangoons were amazing! Egg Foo young was the best I've ever had! Fried rice again scored right at the top!  Attentive staff was there to insure you were satisfied.  Gilbert has some of the best restaurants in the Valley and now we've found another gem just a few miles from home!!  Large dining room insures little to no wait (at least during the week, we visited on a Thursday).  If you like Chinese you'll love Yao's!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, the ladies are always friendly. The food always comes out nice and hot. Fairly inexpensive. What I recommend is the chicken noodles so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly employees. It's about a 30 minute drive from my house and I'd gladly head to Yao's when I'm craving Chinese. Their sweet and sour pork as well as the twice fried pork is amazing. The pork lo mein is also wonderful (yes we like pork LOL)
To top it off and what really made me a fan, they happily offered to help me to my car with my take out box when I had to carry my baby in her car seat!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to go for Chinese food?. originally from St Louis which has the best friend rice of any place I've been, so to find a place that had good rice feels pretty good."}
{"text":"Great find in Gilbert for authentic Chinese food! My family and I went here on a whim and it was definitely worth it! Looks a lot bigger and nicer on the inside and the owners bring the Cantonese influence to their plates. 

I feel like their speciality is noodles! We got a Seafood combination chow mein, beef chow fun, and some kind of spicier \"curry\" influence dish seafood combo style! Wow the plates were huge! Such big portions for such a cheap price!  The noodles were all so yummy! Are they hand made? Probably not cause that would be super difficult to do on a day to day basis, but still good! The flavor of the chow mein was awesome! Good amount of seafood on the plate too! The beef chow fun is excellent as well! The curry-style chow mein would not be for everyone though. It has more of a \"grimy dry\" taste to it, but it's supposed to be that way! I thought it was good!

So it wasn't the best Chinese food I've had, but it's so great for the location! Who would think that there awesome Chinese food in Gilbert that's literally 5 minutes away from my house! Not only that, their service is sooo good! It feels like a \"mom and pop\" restaurant and my advice is, if you speak to the owner, she's really nice and she'll probably throw in some crab puffs for you, at least in my case :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants.  My family loves it, the staff is super friendly. I always get the lo mein and fried rice. The only con is that at least twice the server entered in the wrong amount into the cash register, she had to go back, cancel the incorrect amount and put the correct amount in. It was a little frustrating, but for the most part I really enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Hunan chicken is not on the menu and they were so gracious to make it. Every thing tasted wonderful. Just the right spiceyness. Very very sweet staff. Huge portions. Thanks a bunch"}
{"text":"First experience. 

Was in the mood for some Chinese. I work & live close, so final \"gave this place a shot\". Glad I did. 

It was after 1 PM & patrons were still coming in for lunch. Nice big dinning room with plenty of seating. I opted to do take out. Only a short wait time!

Chinese menu - lots of options to choose from! Lunch special range between $6.95 $ $7.95. I got the General Tso Chicken. I was able to substitute the rice for noodle ( $1 extra) . Also purchased the orange chicken. Both meals came with an egg roll & cream cheese wonton. *Take Out Doesn't Include Soup* 

If gluten is something you try to avoid, check out the gluten- free choices!

Generous portions for the price. By the time I got our food home - it was still very hot ( temperature wise). Chicken in both dishes were good. Couldn't tell much of a difference in taste between the two? I believe next visit, I would go with something a bit more spicy!

Friendly, fast service at affordable prices for lunch and dinner. 

I believe they offer catering services as well."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice Chinese cuisine . we all get good service and nice and hot food that taste as good as it looks. We get the egg fu yuog Pork and they load it up. The sizzling rice soup is delicious and we tend to order that every visit.. Good food good service what more Could you ask for .."}
{"text":"Yo, Yao serves Americanized Chinese food that is pretty good.  The food falls solidly in the 3-3.5 star range.

In my only visit to Yao the service was definitely lacking.  I don't know if this is the norm or they were short-staffed.  I had to wave people down through the entire time I was at Yao to get:
-refills on water
-refills on tea
-boxes to take home leftovers
-the check
-I finally gave up waiting for someone to take the bill and took it to the counter.

I would try Yao again but probably just for takeaway."}
{"text":"We ordered The Roll. It's thick and they only serve 1 so I ordered 2 and shared it with kids - the roll was ok. We had Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mein, Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef. The Mongolian Beef was too sweet. The beef was nice and tender but wished it had more flavor than being it too sweet. The orange chicken was good but the kids mostly liked the Fried Rice and Chow Mein. I must say the staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for quite some time, the food is consistently really good and the service is fast.  The dinner combinations are a great deal and a lot of food."}
{"text":"We met some friends at Yao's last night, all of our first time here.  Great food, Ping was our waitress, she was great, funny and made our evening.  Food was great and reasonably priced.  Dinner combo plate was less than $10.00.  We will eat here again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The soups, crab puffs, egg rolls are great and a must. The ball and chain and I have been here several times. I have tried the general chicken and it's really yummy.

Love to stop by here when we are in the east side."}
{"text":"After reading good reviews for this restaurant in the paper, we decided to eat an early dinner (4:30) there on New Year's eve (there were hardly any other diners at that hour).   I had the hot and sour soup, which was the BEST I've ever had...the egg rolls and crab puffs were also good.  So I eagerly awaited my dinner. But when our entrees arrived, I was stunned at the total lack of taste.  I had ordered the orange chicken and asked for it spicy.  What I got were hunks of breaded and deep fried chicken, barely any discernable sauce, NO orange flavor at all, no spice at all, just a very bland, cold plate of food.  I added tons of hot chili oil, which did not help.  Won't be going back unless I want a great bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Ok Chinese food.  Appetizers are excellent,  main dishes are OK.  Had orange chicken and beef and broccoli.  Don't like that brown orange sauce,  and the beef was a little to mushy,  if there's such a thing.  Referred by friends,  our main Chinese stop is Golden Valley at Extension and baseline.  Yao's did not top that."}
{"text":"I can't believe the positive reviews listed here.  The food is marginal, not authentic.  The quality of the ingredients is poor to fair.

The only saving grace is the low prices.

The ambiance is non existent.

So, if you want belly filling Chinese and are desperate, than go for it.

I restrict myself to take out, when I'm sick of pizza and fried chicken."}
{"text":"I came because of the high ratings, I stayed because of the low dinner prix fixe menu.  $10.75, after tax, will score you any one of their special menu entrees.  My Hamilton garnered me a small cup of egg flower soup, a sizable deep fried egg roll, 2 crab puffs (which I could partake in, as they are not made from real crab) and a plate of kung pao chicken with fried rice.

The chicken was sparse, but the taste was ok.  But lets face it, why get Chinese when there's Thai?  Lesson learned"}
{"text":"My go to for Chinese takeout in the east valley. I can't say much about the service for dine in Bc I always get my food to go, but they really do an amazing job. Portions are HUGE! Family of three,  we will order two entrees and an appetizer and easily have enough for lunch and dinner for the next day. Favorites are the Singapore rice noodle, combo chow mein, Kung pao three flavor, and you cannot go wrong with the crab puffs or egg rolls. Great food, always friendly when I come in, highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Will not return.  Kong Pao Chicken left me ask \"where is chucken?\". Everything was over salted and when I said that the waitress blamed on me not telling her to lighted salted our dishes because Americans like the dishes salty.  What the heck?"}
{"text":"I live pretty close by so I frequently grab take out.  I am always pleased with the quality of both their service and food.  Great prices , great food, and friendly service.  general ts'o chicken plate is pretty much my go to for cheat day cravings, and the crab rangoones are killer."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good Chinese restaurant, and I've finally found one in Gilbert. Orange chicken had the perfect crispness and flavor was good. My vegetable chicken Was delicious, as were my boys Kung pao chicken. The spring rolls and egg flower soup were delicious too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time trying Yao and it was very good. We had the Chicken and veggies and the Beef and broccoli dinner combo plates. Each meal was enough for two. We will be back again"}
{"text":"The last two times I have been here the quality of food and cleanliness of the facility has significantly dropped off. The chicken was cold and the batter was not crispy at all. The egg roll looked like it was cooked hours before and reheated. The tables were not wiped clean and the overall feel of this place was neglect."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Try the Egg Blossom and Orange chicken. Great price for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fast, the staff are so incredibly friendly. We like to try something new every time, and we are never disappointed. My favorite is the Honey Walnut Shrimp."}
{"text":"So happy we found a good Chinese restaurant nearby! Great service and bang for your buck. Love the Kung Pao Chicken."}
{"text":"Never disappointed!!! 
We found this place last year, has the best lunch specials, great price, delicious food, awesome service. Huge portions. Love the wonton soup!  Egg fu young is the best I've ever had. We loved every dish. We go in about 1-2 times a month and they remember us. Can't say enough about this place."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the review here, Yao's is a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant that is well priced and good customer service. When me and wife went we were instantly greeted with a friendly and helpful staff.

The food is OK and is priced accordingly, I had the Kung Pao chicken which was a little on the sweet side. I did however love that they have chestnuts in their food!!!

My wife had the Orange Chicken, it was extremely sweet and a little over whelming.  We saved it for leftovers.

Overall: 

You pay for what you get, don't have high expectations, but its worth a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall, they are always very friendly and the food is served FAST.  I loved the Snow Hill Chicken, and also a fan of the Cashew Chicken, both were very fresh with lots of good vegetables.  Good fried rice on the lunch special and the Hot & Sour Soup and the Eggrolls are delicious.  I like this place and eat here whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Decent service.  Typical American Chinese offerings.  Well executed.  Nothing more, nothing less..."}
{"text":"Have been there numerous times over the years with family and friends. Have also used take-out and had a party catered.
*Yes, you should try it!
*One of the best in Gilbert.
*Food was always very good, less of that 'out of the can' food, that I seem to get at other Chinese restaurants. Always a nice presentation. Large portions.
*Not a fancy place, but comfortable. Good for family, or even meeting a friend....can chat because the music isn't too loud.
*Lunch specials are a bargain.
*Service is courteous and prompt.
*Mushu pork is one of my favorites, and the shrimp with vegetables. Hubby loves the sweet and sour pork.

A Gilbert gem! Go give 'em a try."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch specials always very consistent . My Sugestion is to go eat in instead of Togo as you don't get soup and the portion is smaller.. Otherwise always good and fresh!"}
{"text":"This is my to go place when I don't know where to have lunch. The staff, including the owner, is very friendly and amazingly fast. 

They have lunch specials which includes soup, egg roll and crab puff. I usually take their orange chicken as you get a lot of chicken which fills up your plate. I also like their chicken with veggies, chicken lo mein  when I'm starved and need carbs (comes with soft noodles and rice).

The food is pretty good for what you pay and it is always a joy to go there and chit chat with the staff when not too busy."}
