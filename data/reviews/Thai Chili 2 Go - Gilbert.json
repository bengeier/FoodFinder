{"text":"I tryed it as soon as I saw it in my new neighborhood and my husband and I love it! It's one of our favorite go to restaurants. We usually phone in and take out because the lines can be long and waits of 30 mins for food. We love the chicken pad Thai so much they we haven't tryed any other entrees but I love there tea both unsweetened varieties as well as Thai tea and we like the dumplings too. I've asked other customers about the curry and hear it's really good. Red yellow or green with red curry being the favorite. They always send out neighborhood flyers and frequent customers can join rewards. The points add up pretty fast towards a free entree worth $9 which is any meal..bonus..the people working there are super friendly at my Queen Creek location..prices just went up $1 to the $9 but like me if u love it your going to pay and their business is booming even more than Chipotle next door so that's saying something! Love me some Chipotle too!"}
{"text":"For transparency, I'm a Thai food snob because I grew up on the west coast and lived in Thailand for some years.  Anyway, the staff was friendly and it seemed popular with people.  Personally though, I didn't enjoy the food much.  My child ordered Phad Thai, which was very greasy, and I ordered curry which was very heavy on the salt.  Although it was nice and spicy, I didn't see any Thai chilis -- just jalepenos.   I wanted to order the Thai basil but it appears they don't use Thai holy basil or offer kai dao (fried egg).  

If you're looking for authentic Thai food, this isn't the place -- but it's great that there is a Thai place in GIlbert."}
{"text":"Well this was our first time here. The service was great. The gentleman that took our order was attentive and walked us through the menu since it was our first time. We ordered the pad thai and the spicy eggplant, both hot. The food was quite good, buuutttt I cannot give higher than a 3 star because the food was not thai. It was good, quick, asian fast food like cuisine. It's like the Americanized version of thai food. But I feel that a place with the originating country in the name should be slightly more authentic. It just felt like asian cuisine, but not specifically Thai. Probably wouldn't return since it was nothing special and the prices are very reasonable but similar to those at a more authentic restaurant. Overall, okay."}
{"text":"Wow, very good.  It's almost like being in Thailand (almost).  I had a spicy selection and it was so hot and spicy, yummy.  My wife had a milder selection, but also very good.   Highly recommended for spicy Thai food!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least five times since it opened. Love the yellow curry chicken. Hubby loves pad Thai. Everyone has been friendly and online ordering works great. Glad south gilbert has another restaurant."}
{"text":"I was on hold for more than 20 minutes on two different occassions.  How are they so inefficient?  And when someone answered, they put me back on hold for another 15 minutes.  How can an owner or a manager continue to run the store like this? And hope to have satisfied customers?  This is so annoying."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars not because this is the best Thai food I've ever had in my life - I'm giving it 5 stars because for what this restaurant is, it does it very well. It has a limited menu (a good thing in my opinion!  There aren't 53 items to choose from!) and the prices are reasonable ($9 - $10). It takes about 15-20 min for them to make the food - I am glad to wait since I *hope* it means they don't make everything in a huge batch!  Service has been friendly each time we've gone. I had the yellow curry the last time I went - very tasty!   Basically - it is a smaller restaurant with a basic Thai menu - and it executed on that very well. Friendly service and good quality food - it is the newest place in our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I wish I could ZERO STARS FOR THIS LOCATION ONLY. Maybe someone can explain what in the world is happening down there. I just walked in for a to go order and counted LITERALLY 5 people dining (this includes the 2 people outside)- and what appeared to be only 2 people waiting and was told it will take an hour for any order. An hour? Really? Even with an empty restaurant? I understand there are to-go orders as well, however its 8:30pm on a Friday night and your restaurant is virtually empty. This isn't the first time this has happed. Last time my husband went in to place a to-go order for 1 entree in a similar situation (only a couple people there). 50 minutes later. This place is crazy. The only explanation is that they must cater private party orders consisting of 80 entrees every single night.????!?! Its possible right.... If you want to take your chances- Plan for an hour wait."}
{"text":"Had the yellow chicken curry with white rice.  Ingredients are all fresh and everything tasted great.  Good atmosphere to eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Excellent service. I tried their Tom Kha Gai Soup and their Penang Beef, which are my two favorite dishes. They were brought out promptly, hot, and with the perfect flavor of expensive restaurants. I was impressed. Others in my party were very happy with their food, too.  We all will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the Thai iced tea  nick and Jacob are also my favorite! They have amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Terrible. The first time we ordered it would be an HOUR for a to-go order. Tonight I order at 7:50 and it's a \"30 minute wait\" - I get there 35 minutes later and they can't find my order. I make mistakes so I verified the # I called - yep I called the right place. The manager comes out and tells me my order was ready over an hour ago and they thought I wasn't coming so they threw it away. Hmmm but I didn't even order an hour ago! 

Then he verified I called the right number again. Yep- same # you checked on my phone already. They just looked at me like I was crazy. Peace out to this location- I'll be going back to the one on Power & Ray where they have it together!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. My favorite is the pad thai because it is very delicious. The managers here have excellent customer service. The food is cooked in a timely manner. Make sure to take advantage of their online coupons to get a great deal on your orders."}
{"text":"I am beyond excited to have a great Thai place so close to our neck of the woods! Since they opened we've gotten take out almost once a week and each time it has been amazing! Massaman curry is my all time favorite curry, and it is so hard to find a Thai restaurant that actually makes it, Their Massaman curry is exactly what it should be, creamy, peanuty and delicious! My wife loves the Pad Thai and the Yellow Curry (secret tip, add pineapple, sounds crazy...it's soooo delicious!), both are wonderful and the flavors are spot on for Thai cuisine! So far everything we have tried has been wonderful, and we're so happy to keep coming back as long as they keep making delicious curry."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't give this place more than 3 stars since the flavor on the food and the quality seems to have been going downhill. I don't mind the change in containers people are mentioning... I mean, it IS to go food... but more than once the spicy level has been a bit off and the noodles overcooked. 
This could easily be a 4/5 star to go Thai place because of the convenience of location and the prices, but consistency is key in a take out place I think."}
{"text":"When this location first opened, we were excited to have another restaurant option nearby.  My husband and I have ordered food many times, and each time, the service time is slower and slower... and slower.  We don't bother ordering in person anymore, because the wait is just outrageous.  Typically, when we order online, the wait is at least 30-35 minutes to pick up the food.  And the food is NEVER ready when we arrive to pick it up.  The prices have remained the same, while the style of to-go containers have changed at least 3 times (which also seems to decrease the portion size... yet the price stays the same).  Once again tonight, we were told our food would take 35 minutes to prepare, but when my husband arrived he had to wait an additional 20 minutes.  Almost an hour for to-go is beyond excessive.  Not to mention, when he got home, we discovered our order was wrong: I had requested mild for my entree, but my dish was so spicy I couldn't eat it, they gave us the wrong soup, and my husband's dish was missing all spice entirely.  At this point, the convenience of this location doesn't make it worth ordering from them any more.  Time for us to move on."}
{"text":"We have picked up to-go orders here several times. The first time was Jan., the staff has always been friendly with me and are able to explain what the dishes are and heat levels, if you have questions. Food does take a while, because they make it at time of order. If no one is ahead of you plan for about 20 min. If 1-2 people are ahead of you plan to wait at least 30 min. When we call in an order and they are not busy, it takes 20 min also.  Keep in mind we have not ordered at busy times. Mostly we have gotten lunch on weekend or early dinner. 
We have ordered the green curry with chicken, Panang curry with Chicken, Pad Thai, Thai dumplings, & Tom Yum Gai soup. The middle heat level is nice and spicy but not crazy. The pad thai is a bit too sweet and lacks eggs which we love in our Pad Thai in Thailand, but still very tasty. The green curry has nice flavor but could use a bit more basil, and the Panang curry is just wonderful with a balance of sweet and spicy and light peanut flavor. The curries have slices of carrots, bell peppers and basil, could use a little more veggies. Last weekend we over ordered, and got 2 orders of the Panang, with same heat. What was interesting is that one was perfect and the other one was more watery, not as tasty, and had more heat. So I am assuming they made each dish separate, which might contribute to the longer waits.  With curries you have an option for white rice, brown rice or noodles. We have only ordered brown rice, one time they accidentally gave us white rice, so check your containers. Rice is always cooked perfectly. My husband loves the dumplings, last week they were the best in comparison, but I feel they are a tad plain. Soup was good, and a nice lighter option. 

I have ordered the Thai iced tea 2x. The first time in January it was very good but too sweet, last week it was insane too sweet. We couldn't even drink it. Please reduce the sugar significantly. 
Maybe have a lighter option with coconut milk instead of dairy and like a quarter of the sugar? 

When my husband and I get the pad thai and one curry with brown rice, that is enough to share and be full. 
If you sign up online you get a free Thai dumpling app email coupon. It was easy to get with our order, just had to show proof."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, and quality of food. First time trying Thai food and I am impressed. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The pad siew is too sweet. I must have a cup of sugar in it. It was more like a super sweet dessert than a savory meal. Very close to being inedible. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The pad Thai tasted like BBQ sauce. The eggs rolls were good but not great. Overall a disappointment."}
{"text":"We call it, \"Thigh Chili Thursdays\" in our house!! Delicious.  The food is always fresh.  I really enjoy the bags they use to package the meals.  They are of obvious quality and craftsmanship.  The bags are pleated and creased to perfection.  Thanks for the perfect presentation of a handsomely sealed bag."}
{"text":"I am very happy that someone from Thai Chili reached out to me after my review.  It shows that they care and are interested to improve.  Great customer service.  For that I have bumped them up one star."}
{"text":"Really great Yellow Curry,  Pad Thai and Thai Iced Tea. Fast friendly service and loved the Gluten free, Vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Yesterdays visit to order, was a disappointment to say the least! I have ordered food dozens of times here since they opened. It's very convenient, since I live around the corner! I find out that one of my favorites, that I order with every take out has been discontinued! They have taken their Chicken Spring Rolls off of the menu! What asian cuisine restaurant doesn't offer some type of Spring Roll/Egg Roll?. Plus when I got home I had to deal with very mushy brown rice! Well, it looks like I need to find another alternative, it was good while it lasted!"}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai, which is rice noodles stir fried with bean sprouts, green onions, and eggs with their homemade Pad Thai sauce, and topped with crushed peanuts. I ordered the peanuts on the side, because I don't like them, and I got tofu as well. The meal was mediocre, not bad, but nothing to write home about, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the food at Thai Chili to Go!  We live in Gilbert and prior to the location at Higley and Chandler Heights opening we had to travel to Queen Creek to pick up our food - something we were more than willing to do.  We were very happy when we learned that the location at Higley and Chandler Heights was opening since it would be about 3 miles from our house.  Avoid this location!  This is most horribly managed restaurant I have ever encountered.

All orders placed online because the wait time to order in person is ridiculous.

Order #1 - Picked up our to go order and the order was not ready when promised. When we got home we discovered that an entire entree was missing.  They acknowledged the mistake so we had to return to pick up the missing entree and warm up the food we had picked up 30 minutes earlier.  A mistake, it happens.

Order #2 - Ordered multiple entrees and the order was not ready when promised.  Since we had missing food on our first order we checked the bag to make sure everything was there.  When we arrived home and my wife opened her red curry w/shrimp it was like a half order and there were only 2 shrimp when there is normally 6 (it's $3 extra for shrimp).  It literally looked like it was an eat in order that was half finished, transferred to a take out container and accidentally placed in our bag.  My wife called the restaurant and they assured us that was not the case but to come back and they would give us a full order.  I am still not sure what happened and if it was someone's left overs but it was another meal that resulted in most of our order being cold before everyone had their food.

Order #3 - February 14, 2018.  We placed our order online and received an email stating it would be ready in 50 minutes.  50 minutes?  Oh well, it's Valentine's Day on a weeknight so takeout is a great option and they must be slammed.  We arrived at our designated time and were told it would be another 10 minutes.  We had to wait 25 minutes along with the entire seating area of people that also were waiting well beyond the promised time.  Needless to say after waiting nearly an hour after placing the order then having to wait an additional 25 minutes in the restaurant is ridiculous when you are a takeout restaurant.  There were a lot of upset people there last night.

Any restaurant is entitled to an occasional mistake and any one of these alone would have been fine, especially since the food is great, but I cannot recommend this location to anyone and will never return again.

I have had positive experiences at Queen Creek , Power Road and Alma School Road locations so I suggest those.

By the way, I would have addressed my concerns directly with management but they have no method of contacting them on their website, which is probably not just an accidental omission..."}
{"text":"Finally real curry in Gilbert. If you are questionable about trying something new. This place will not disappoint. Most people think curry and automatically think no way. Well you are missing out on greatness if you are one of these people. Thank you Thai Chili"}
{"text":"We had a coupon.  So we made a special trip here to check it out.

Their menu is somewhat limited, but it does have the classic Thai dishes.  I opted for Drunken Noodles.  My wife had Fried Rice.  Nothing fancy.  The manager was very good at greeting people and explaining the menu.

The noodles were fine.  Not \"wonderful\" or anything of the sort.  But OK.  The Fried Rice also was 'fine\".  I debated going to two stars since I most definitely have had better.  But that would imply it was bad, and it wasn't. And the manager was very gregarious and helpful. But if I'm going for Thai food I think I will go somewhere else.

I do note other reviews mention the curry.  We didn't have that, so I can't comment.  But the noodles and rice were just \"OK\"."}
{"text":"Delish!  Pad Thai and pineapple curry...two great choices!  The medium spiciness is pretty hot!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai, very quick. I stopped in with my wife for lunch. The fried dumplings were delivered to the table quickly and crispy. They are very tasty. The drunken noodles were flavorful, plentiful, and spicy. Medium spicy was just right for me, a nice burn while not overpowering the flavors of the dish. The Panang curry was flavorful, delicious, sweet, and spicy (medium again). The restaurant is very clean and the service is attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Gross fake thai food. Waited over 30 minutes when no one was in store.  The drunken noodles were made by a drunk. Noodles under cooked and sloppy sauce, pathetic measly amount of protein and veggies. Egg rolls had oil pouring out of the wrapper. Grease saturated and just inedible. Makes me wonder how dumbed down the people of this nation have become when they consider this a good place to eat. Why is it the lazy internet slugs take priority over walk in customers? This is the mcdonalds of Thai food fake and inedible. Never consider this a good option for food.  And contrary to the ding bats that say otherwise their service is terrible."}
{"text":"Home delivery came hot and quick. Spiced right. Drunken noodle and pad Thai with tofu were both delicious!"}
{"text":"best thai food I've ever had been so long great to know there is a Thai facility in our area  5 Stars Manager Rob Was Very Helpful and Knowledgeable on all Products.Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is always good. I typically go to the Ellsworth location but this was closer. Food was fast and fresh as always. My only complaint about these guys is the paper bowls. No idea why they went away from the glass bowls with real silverware but it just seems cheaper now, especially with the plastic silverware. Either way, great place to eat and just the right portion."}
{"text":"Thai Chili 2 Go is always good, from any location. This Gilbert location went above and beyond for me. I placed 2 orders online (1 for me 1 for a friend). A guy from TC2G called me to verify that there were in fact 2 orders and that it was not a mistake. This shows me they really care about their customers."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but both times it was really good. I only ordered from here the first time because another Thai place was closed Sundays and I was craving Pad Thai something fierce. The hot wasn't too hot, but I added Sriracha and it made the whole thing A1. Also, the Thai tea and iced coffee are both super, super good. I'm taking off one star because when I went in to pick up my order, the two employees were sitting around and talking, and I had to sit there for a while before they got to me, even though there was no one in line. Otherwise, it was great."}
{"text":"Limited menu but what they do have is made very well.  Wish they had raw papaya salad. Love the green curry"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because they are constantly busy or potentially they are just that into making it great but with a little planning ahead this is well worth the wait!  We're starting to move around the menu and we've been very happy with everything we've had so far.  Always very fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"The Thai Tea is freaken the most amazing one I have had in my life so far. I wish they had boba, but holly crap it's heaven in your mouth! So good! The fried rice and curry is outstanding. Little pricey - hard to afford with Thai being your favorite. I could it the fried rice every single day for breakfast hahaha. But I don't know maybe they will lower the price a tad bit down. And maybe come up with some lunch and dinner specials to, at least lunch so if you want more than one item but don't want to spend that much then at least you can provide a meal. I think it's a plan! But super yummy!!"}
{"text":"First time to Thai chili.  Great selection.  Delicious fresh vegetables. The pad prig pap medium was just right and tasty. Will return"}
{"text":"Delicious! Always hot, fresh food. I highly recommend drunken noodles with chicken and the pad siew with beef. Prices are very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"This place needs serious help. I called a takeout order and the wait was 40 minutes. I went ahead and placed my order. Forty minutes later, I walked in and there were several people waiting who all looked agitated. I pay for my order and cashier says it will be another 15 minutes after I pay."}
{"text":"Came to thai chili to go on April 1 and was very pleased as usual. Only place that makes my thai iced coffee amazing every time!!! Great service from amazing friendly staff. Well managed with good food!!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best and kindest service I ever got!!!

The first thing that you'll notice about this place is the service! The people here are so hospitable here! I believe the manager Rob was taking our orders and you can tell he really cares about his customers and presents himself in a professional yet inviting manner. 

My wife ordered the pad Thai and I ordered the pad siew and since I don't like veggies i asked for no broccoli. Rob quickly asked if I wanted to substitute the broccoli with anything else, free of charge. That was awesome, I didn't even think about it. I got mushrooms with my pad siew again. 

Both the pad Thai and the pad siew were delicious. This was my first time ordering something other than pad thai and I made a good choice. It's a sweet glazed sauce, that kinda reminds me of bulgogi or teriyaki sauce and the mushrooms went well with the fat noodles! 

Not only this, but the place is super clean! The bathrooms are super nice too! It's the little things that makes this place somewhere I'll come back to!

I highly recommend this place to anyone, great Thai food and great service!!!! 

Tips:
1) there's a lot of coupons out there, usually buy one get one half off or 20% off your entire order
2) you can customize any dish you want, if you don't want a certain veggie, substitute it for something else"}
{"text":"The service is great, so I really wanted to love the food. While tasty, the food is not knock-you-socks off good. But, the friendly service is a great balance. The yellow curry is flavorful and hearty, so be sure you're hungry if you plan on eating it by yourself. If your hankering for Thai food and friendly service in the area, I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I came in earlier today to this restaurant that seems to be going downhill in their customer service area. The girl at the counter was very very helpful with the menu and explaining my options per dish. She had long dark hair. When I turn around I see quite a bit of tickets up at their food window. Behind me there was a young girl who was an employee with blonde hair who was sitting down at a table laughing with who seemed to be the store manager? That really showed me what their priorities are. I'm glad that they're being paid to laugh and hang out. She should have been cleaning the tables or sweeping the floor. It was obvious that they don't take the time to do that. Don't come here if you want to be put first as a customer."}
{"text":"I had a girl named Cassidy ring me up and she was super friendly! I love Thai chili 2 go!"}
{"text":"Terrible management. I've come to this location a few times now in the hopes it would get better as it is a newer location. Each time has been a negative experience whether it be long wait times, unfriendly service or an overall unwillingness to emphasize customer satisfaction. Further, don't bother using the online ordering coupons they hand out as they do not work and will not honor them when you try and add it to an order in store. Terrible."}
{"text":"Forgot the mushrooms in my chicken curry that I paid extra for. Needless to say I will not be returning back to this location."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they seem very overwhelmed on a Friday evening.  My pickup order took over 45 minutes until it was ready to go.  The whole place was filled with people patiently waiting and waiting and waiting for their food to get done.  I'm not sure if more staffing in the kitchen would help or if they're limited by the kitchen itself.  Either way, it looks like they're doing well and may be ready for yet another new location.  

This is my second time eating here.  The food is really pretty delicious.  The best Thai food I've had was actually in Hawaii.  This isn't on that level, but it's full of flavor with generous portions.  I hope they open another location soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so cold. I will not return. Restaurants keep the temp low for the comfort of the cooks. They don't care about the comfort of the  customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We got the fried rice with beef, lo mein with chicken, and dumplings. All amazing. Only star missing is because the prices are high for the amount of food you get"}
{"text":"We tried Thai Chili 2 Go on my son's recommendation - Saturday evening and I didn't feel like cooking. After his rave reviews I was really anticipating a great meal. However, I was sorely disappointed by both the meal and the service.

Ordering online was easy enough: the menu was simple and the website easily navigated. I received a confirmation email several minutes after placing the order, and then a second email advising of when the order would be ready. Not bad, seemed efficient, EXCEPT for the 45-minute quote.

I arrived a little earlier than the specified time in the hope the order would be ready early. No such luck. When I checked in with what should have been 5 minutes to go I was advised it would be about 20 minutes. Seriously?! So I sat and waited (I was offered a beverage, which was kind, but I wanted my food), and waited, and waited. And I watched, while the expediters jockeyed tickets instead of preparing them in order, with delivered orders (the Door Dash and Uber Eats drivers) noticeably being pushed ahead of others waiting - who does that?

Finally, an hour plus after placing my order, for \"fast\" food, my name was finally called and I took my bag of food home. No napkins or utensils were provided. My husband and son both seemed to enjoy their meals - or they were just so hungry it didn't matter. My son had fried rice with chicken and shrimp; my husband had Panang curry. I had the drunken noodles with chicken, that had nice heat, and okay flavor, but were DROWNING in oil, and the noodles were matted together. I actually had to peel them apart before I could eat. Yuck!

I started out excited and hopeful, but ended full of regret and none too happy about having my time and money wasted. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great new location in my neighborhood. So fresh and fast.  My entire family was raving.  
 Impressed by the service too! They have mild option if you are like me and cant do spicy."}
