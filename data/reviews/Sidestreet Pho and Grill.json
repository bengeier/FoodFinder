{"text":"Omg...seriously? Like seriously?!?! How did they make it taste so f*ucking good?! It's unnatural! I had the Grilled pork and egg rolls rice noodles with the fish sauce and man...man! The way the mint interacts with the sauce and the way the crunch of the bean sprouts compliments the basil, and the pork, dear GOD the PORK?!?! It's unfair I tell ya! I give it 2 thumbs and a big toe straight to the heavens, where the recipe descended from!"}
{"text":"Good Food!!! Everything is made fresh, the people are friendly, the PHO IS AMAZING!!!!! Best I ever had.  The fried rice is Delicious
Like sports, well they have the games on!!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food and service, fresh and all made in-house.  The owner was super nice & helpful and was very accommodating to my Gluten allergy (all Rice paper/noodles are Gluten Free).  Loved every dish but my favorite was Pho with rare steak and brisket; Grilled lemongrass chicken, shredded pork skin & egg loaf; Pan fried rice cake with egg; caramel flan and fresh spring roll with grilled pork.  I'm lactose intolerant so I'm not meant to have caramel flan. I only had a bite from my friend's flan but next time, I'm going to order one for myself and worry about the pain later! The owner said that the flan is the most popular dessert and its made by his wife.  

You can tell that the owner is very passionate about food and loves his tea, brought out his tea collection to show us and told us when was the best time to have them & how to best prepare tea.  He even gave us a sample of oolong tea to try at home.  We had pu-erh tea and they were good quality tea, it was strong even after 3rd fills with hot water.  

It took us nearly 20 mins drive to get there but it was worth the trip.  I'm only in Vegas for a week and I'm definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, friendly staff and extremely clean! Better than any Pho place in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Finally found our Pho restaurant in Las Vegas! The owner is accommodating, ordered for me on an evening I was dog tired and hangry. Have tried the bahn mi, Pho, spring rolls - every time they are delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and fresh ingredients are key to a great dining experience. I definitely recommend the phô ga and the fresh lemonade and lime soda drink.
I also love the \"build your own phô\" menu options. I highly recommend this little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've came here couple times, and it's been good every single time. I recommend it to everyone =). Pho is always delicious, egg rolls are amazing. It's always clean and quick service."}
{"text":"I always judge a viet restaurant based on their pho. I always get the Pho dac biet which is the usual go to for pho and i always get it in large. This broth is one of the best in Las vegas. Its not greasy at all comparing it to Pho Kim Long which is SUPER oily and very salty. Now I love when i get my moneys worth as well. They give you LOTS of tendons which is the \"fatty\" things in the pho which i love. The meat is good too cause you know its good when they serve it rare as it should be. I gave a huge compliment to the manager and he was super friendly. I told him that this pho is just as good as nyc pho which is where im from. Definitely my go to for pho."}
{"text":"Beef stew was delicious, loved the rich beefy broth and tender pieces of beef and tendon!
Egg rolls were nicely fried with a light wrap and filled with a generous amount of vegetables and pork. 
Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week, literally I am obsessed with noodle soups and this place meets my needs. Their pho is probably one of the best in the Summerlin area; their wonton noodle is flavorful as well, egg rolls are standard, bun bo hue is very good (their noodles are sometimes overdone), Vietnamese coffee is a necessity! Seriously though, their Vietnamese coffee is the best!"}
{"text":"I know nothing about Vietnamese food, but what I've tried here has been good. I usually just pick up on my way home. Loved the pork chop I'd read about and could eat an entire platter full. The shredded pork skin was just ok to me, but better when I added it to the broth. Had the pho with beef brisket more than a few times and the small is two meals for me! Can't wait to explore other menu items.
Great staff. Everyone here has been so nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We found a used band aid on the table right next to the utensils. Disgusting. We walked out immediately without ordering."}
{"text":"This is our favorite casual Pho restaurant in Vegas! We are always seated immediately and the service is fast, friendly and efficient. We start with the fried eggrolls served on a bed of lettuce with carrot slaw and fish sauce. They are consistently delicious; crispy on the outside, tender inside. The Large Rare Steak Pho is next. The broth is fresh and flavorful, brimming with noodles, perfectly sliced meat, onions and scallions. Be sure to add in plenty of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and lime that are served on the side. Don't forget the Hoisin sauce for dipping. I love that my water glass is never empty here! Overall great value for excellent, authentic Pho."}
{"text":"They have a nice staff and good customer service - is why I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1.  Their pho is absolutely FULL of sugar.  I'm not certain why they do that because it is completely unnecessary.  Without the abundance of sugar, their pho would be decent."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious especially the pho. The area is close to my home and the atmosphere is nice.  Service is great and fast while a smile and small conversation from the employees from time to time.  Definitely recommend trying if you haven't already. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously!!!! So thankful to have found this gem!! So close to home and better than our old place in Chinatown.. Win win!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best Vietnamese in the Las Vegas area.   Service and food quality, as well as freshness are all top notch.
Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese place. Very attractive interior with large glass walls giving view of park and Strip. Food is light and flavorful. Staff very friendly, but we're too busy to check on drink refill."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this joint! Food is always great and very convenient location. We don't have to drive all the way down to Spring Mtn area! And of course excellent customer service too! They're very prompt on your order whether dine in or take-out!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the restaurant and picked up food once. All times have been great! Service is fast and friendly. My boyfriends mom is Vietnamese and she says this place has the best pho she's had so far in town.  Will definitely be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is bom diggity! Pho was delicious and would highly recommend!  5 star for me!"}
{"text":"They forgot one of our orders, the food was bland, and I don't eat pork and when I ordered the shrimp plate without pork, somehow pork was in my food."}
{"text":"Keep hearing about this Pho joint so we decided to give it a try. Sadly enough, this place did not satisfy my craving for pho. I'm Vietnamese and I know right away a good bowl of Pho as soon as my first sip taste of the broth. They can bypass the flavor if they serve to the Caucasians because they wouldn't know what to expect in the broth. To make it short, broth was bland and tasted like they used Pho flavoring bouillon instead of beef bones because broth was dark and bland. When brought out, my bowl of pho was not very hot and meat was too chewy. There's so much MSG in their ingredients that after leaving the restaurant I can feel my tongue is tingling and feeling numb. To make it short, I'm not coming back!!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch and REALLY enjoyed it. Started with a shrimp pork spring roll. It was nicely refreshing.  I'd order it again because it was a good compliment to the pho with brisket, meatballs and flank I had. The brisket was absolutely great and the broth was fantastic. Tons of real flavor and not just loaded with extra salt. I added just basil, jalapeño and a little lime. Didn't want to mess it up with any sauces. Coffee was good and service was great."}
{"text":"Good pho, noodle dishes, and atmosphere. The service is fast and attentive."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. My Vietnamese wife loves it too, which means it's authentic! Lots of seating available, great location, and a friendly and hardworking staff equals a great place to go for lunch, or dinner. Try the sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I love pho, but hate driving to Chinatown to go to my favorite places. I was hesitant to try it, but so glad I did. My mom and I each ordered the chicken breast pho and we shared an order of egg rolls. The egg rolls were perfectly cooked.  The broth for the pho was flavorful and not greasy and the chicken was very tender. I am so excited to have a place to get pho that's close to Summerlin."}
{"text":"I've had my eyes on this place for a couple of weeks now. My boyfriend and I finally got the chance to try it today on this rainy day. I ordered  P1 with beef balls and brisket. The broth was piping hot and flavorful. I'm usually a fan of Pho So 1, but I think this will be our new go to place. The girl who served us was a little rude at first, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt because we all have our bad days ;) The owner of the place was super nice and accommodating, he made sure to check up on us multiple times and made sure his customers were well taken care of. I think we've found our new go to place!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a great pho place near Summerlin for a long time and was estatic when i ran across this place. The chicken pho was amazing. Best broth I have had at a local pho place!!"}
{"text":"The best Pho Dac Biet i ever had!
Helpful staffs!
Delicious chicken wings and fried veggie egg roll!!"}
{"text":"Great hot pot. What a treat to find super fresh Pho made with all top ingredients. Thank you Leon Le for taking us. Highly recommended  great service felt like family. Will return"}
{"text":"Great service food was great, beef was very tender and very clean!  Excellent pho food in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"We ordered Pho, Bun, Crispy eggrolls, Vietnamese coffee...all delicious. Good size portions. The servers were pleasant, helpful, and efficient. We were too full for dessert, but we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great but Service & Cleanliness is even better which is very important to me! My go to place for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Place is the bomb.  Get the PHO down here and try the rib eye.  It's the bomb! You'll be stoked you tried this place.  Better than the other places in Chinatown by far."}
{"text":"Good to the last drop. Service excellent! Quick and hot.  Enjoyed everything and would go back again.  Meat good, noodles fantastic, base soup excellent. Spent some time with head man who explained how to enjoy the meal, how to pair the spices and how to keep food on chop sticks. We had a great meal. Will remember to bring my wine next time. And by the way you could tell food was authentic, wife and I were the only ones speaking English."}
{"text":"I love when I order Vietnamese food & I get a bunch of veggies & meat! I called in a phone order & it was ready once I got there. For about $12 I got the Vermicelli with beef, shrimp, and egg rolls. I recommend this spot if you're in the mood for Vietnamese food & don't want to drive all the way into town!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant customer service I have ever been to. The server is rude and cannot understand what you're ordered and bring the wrong food, and when I complained about it this guy claims that's he's the owner and says that he will make it right . At the end he claims that he some kind of celebrity poker player and that he doesn't have to do anything for me and told me not to come back. If I could give a zero star I would. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho place I've ever been too! I ordered the H3 (Mi Xa Xiu-BBQ Pork Egg Noodle Soup: Egg & rice noodle soups garnished with choy sum, fried shallots, cilantro and green onion). Not only was the food great but the customer service was outstanding, 10/10! Our servers were friendly and always welcomed my friends with a smile. It was the perfect place to dine in before leaving Vegas. I highly recommend coming here if you're craving a bowl of delicious noodle soup. #41716"}
{"text":"Mall strip mall restaurant, but don't let that fool you, service is excellent and prompt.  We had Vegetarian Spring rolls as an appetizer and they were marvelous, then Vietnamese Beef Stew that was savory and very well spiced, Seafood and Noodles with broth which was exceptional and a mixed beef Pho.  This location is on our Bookmark list, We will be back !"}
{"text":"Very nice place... Servers are so nice and attentive!!! The food tastes so fresh and good!! The restaurant is spotless and smells so good when you walk through the door !! I will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Pho rib eye is a must try.  The beef is fresh & the soup is awesome.  Bun bo hue is also one of my favorites.  Great attentive service too."}
{"text":"Food was as advertised/reviewed by others...love that it's so close to home too! And nicest people imaginable too!!"}
{"text":"This was the first Pho place I ever tried in Vegas. I absolutely love the Shrimp Pho. I was actually sick for a few days and after eating this 2-3days in a row.. I was feeling much better. Only thing is the places gets packed so its hard to place a to go order. Online ordering would make this so much easier but even the wait and chaos IS WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"good food, glad to have west side pho place. nice staff"}
{"text":"SUPER Yummy!! The broth of the pho was wonderful. Had pork spring rolls that were really fresh. Best pho I've had in Vegas. Very friendly staff with good service. So glad we have this restaurant in Summerlin"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a very clean restaurant, which is important. I've been here twice and each time I walk through the front door we're greeted and seated immediately. I've eaten the Pho, spring rolls and chicken wings, all very yummy. I think next time I'll try the vermicelli."}
{"text":"Amazing place! If I'm in need for a nice hot soup I come here. I ordered the special combo, and the pho here is soooooo good. The service is very friendly too. They're nice and patient. I would definitely come here again. I left the  restaurant satisfied."}
{"text":"It's my first time at this place, just happen to drive by and love the beef noddles also excellent service. I'm coming back again and only 10 min away from my house and office . I would recommend it to my family and friends."}
{"text":"As a Vegas native I've been to other Pho restaurants in town but nothing compares to the fragrant and delicious pho soup at this restaurant. The rib eye pho is fantastic, the spring rolls crispy and delicious and the service is friendly. I would make this my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Can't wait to try more of the options. Love that it's also near Summerlin. I would almost compare the soup to some amazing ones I've tried in LA and SD. Keep up the great work Sidestreet!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food and good guest service. Lots of good choices! Portions are huge and prices are average. Very clean. Will be coming back real soon. $85 for 5 people + 4

{"text":"Best Pho on west side of town. Very fast service and fresh ingredients. 

We had pho tai and tai ice tea. Our go to place!"}
{"text":"My new favorite nearby Vietnamese cuisine! The pho  tai  and spring rolls are delicious... takeout food is still a great option and they provide many herbs and fresh accompanying items that compliment the food to perfection! #repeatcustomer"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and had the most wonderful experience. I was promptly greeted and sat down at a table. The waiter I had was very kind and attentive. I ordered the pho with rare steak that came out to my table very quickly. It was fresh, flavorful, and all around great. I will definitely be returning with my family and coworkers in the future. This is my new favorite place to get pho in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious pho and tasty banh mi. Definitely recommend this place. Broth for the pho is  always perfect. It's a little bit out of my way but well worth the extra Drive as pho places on my side of town are lacking."}
{"text":"I love this place! The soup is ready within minutes and it is great quality.  For those who would compare it to pho Kim long, it's busy enough but you can always get a seat, the service is nice and helpful every time, the noodle amount is crazy way more than Kim long. 

They have a TV always playing sports ( guys)  but it is still a nice noise level and ambience. My recommendation is P1 ( just say that they know) with rare steak. Plus the egg rolls are so good. 

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Very casual environment, the go to is the Pho rib eye served hot pot on the side to avoid any extra fat in your pho and cooling off your main broth . Dipping is always fun. Next don't sleep on the bahn mi delicious pork bbq on a baguette with veggies cilantro and jalepenos if you wish . Overall not fancy but you go for food not the looks ."}
{"text":"The waiter was not very attentive not helpful. My food was ok but I drove out from the strip and was a little disappointed. I will try another place before returning"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the same area of one of my favorite Japanese restaurant; Sen of Japan.

Nice small place. The decor is nice and I was seated quickly with a smile.

I only ordered 2 items. Wonton Egg noodle soup and fried egg rolls. Never get the large bowl. I think it's a sucker bet. I liked the egg noodles and the wontons were small but taste pretty alright. The barbecue pork is a good addition. Not the best barbecue pork but it will do. Egg rolls were standard and they were hot and fried to order. The broth was really good, not too overpowering but just right. Very well balanced. Soup broths don't have a standard taste. It depends on the house recipe. It's tough to mess up Vietnamese food. I like this place because of the location and the speedy service by super friendly people.

I will definitely go back to try the other items."}
{"text":"Came here after a cold hike in the snow up on mt. Charleston and I should of gotten pho but the photos of the vermicelli bowls looked sooo bomb I had to get it. Definitely delicious like oh my lord. I finished the entire bowl. Too bad I don't live in Vegas.  But If I did this would be my go to spot."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in town. They even have small servings which I love because is the perfect amount for me."}
{"text":"First time here. The pho, vietnamese crepe, and egg rolls were very good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Where we are originally from, there is a huge Vietnamese community and on every corner, there is a pho noodle place. When we moved we were so disappointed and thought we'd never find one again. Low and behold, this place was right across the street. It's clean and the people are very friendly! The food is fast and is clean! Every time we come here we have a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"This time I had the special combo pho and they were generous with the meats unlike my last review. Mild broth flavor, the tripe was a little chewy but the meatball was really good. Basil had some browning but that didn't deter my review. What I like about this place is that you can \"build\" your own pho by picking three of the meats listed."}
{"text":"One of the other PHO place close to the Summerlin area.
Environment: Acceptable. Tables could be a little cleaner. Looking at an angle, you can see old food particulate matter. 
Modern Decor
Friendly staff member.
Food:Pretty good. One of the better PHO place close to the Summerlin area. Portion:Large.. 
Would I return: Yes. It's close by to Summerlin.
It's one of the better PHO place in this area.
However, the best PHO place is usually on Spring Mountain area."}
{"text":"I have been ordering to go from this place here and there. I love pho and it's very convenient that there is a location close by. By the time I arrive it's ready for pickup. 

Their pho soul hits the spot. I have tried their appetizers ie potstickers and they're good. 

You can't go wrong with this place. Plus as far as I know, this is the only place I'm aware that you don't pay cash under $12 like some pho restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try this place after another appointment.  The reviews were great for this place .

We ordered fresh shrimp and pork spying rolls to start out.  The wife ordered a grilled pork with lemongrass vermicelli bowl, and I ordered the grilled prawns in lemongrass vermicelli bowl with egg rolls.

Both items were very good.  The wife's serving of grilled pork was larger than we have seen at most Vietnamese places.   My dish had six grilled shrimp with plenty of flavor.  Egg rolls tasty and the fish style sauce was very good.  

If there was a weak spot, it was the fresh spring rolls.  They lacked flavor as the pork and shrimp were not grilled.  

We will go back because overall it was very good."}
{"text":"I stopped here thinking it was a fast food place and I didn't have time during the middle of my errands to stay and eat. So I walked in an tried to walk out when a nice man came up and asked if he could help me. I told him I thought it was fast food and that I didn't have a lot of time. He explained I could order something to go and that it wouldn't take long. He sold me o the Angus steak with tomato rice. I also decided on some pork and shrimp spring rolls. The food was OK. The beef was too dry and overcooked although I liked the flavoring. The rice and spring rolls were also dry. I always find that to be the case with these freshly wrapped uncooked spring rolls anywhere you get them. Although they give some peanut, which I'm not crazy about, and hot sauce, I wish they would put some sauce in side the roll, along with some salt to the ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Fast friendly close to my house!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Best pho I have ever had. The Broth is so tasty. I never eat all my broth but at this place I always do. The fresh squeezed lemonade is so delicious and it comes in mason jars:) The grilled pork spring rolls are so good we got a to go order after dinner. The service is phenomenal. The owner, ken, is so friendly and takes great pride in his place. This is our new pho place for sure. Go try it out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service, staff is super friendly.   The food was even better.  Highly recommend.  Big variety of food too."}
{"text":"Americanized Vietnamese Food!

After a busy black Friday, I took the family here for the simple fact that it's much closer to our place in Summerlin than our usual favourites of Pho So 1 and Pho Saigon, both in Chinatown.

We were the only Asians there at the time, which is usually a poor predictive factor.

The things that struck me right off the bat was how clean the place was and the fact that most menu items were $2 more than our favorite places.

My wife complained about the bleach smell coming from the recently mopped floor.

My kids split the beef stew. I thought it was tasty, but a little tougher than I'm used to. The egg noodles that I chose to go with it (as opposed to vermicelli or bread) was too chewy.

The pho came with 3 choices of meat. I chose flank steak, meatballs and some other beef product. The soup was a little saltier than usual. The meat was nondescript as was the noodles.  My wife describes it as \"adequate.\"

I had the bun (cold and dry vermicelli) with chicken, egg rolls and fish sauce. The portion was surprisingly generous. The chicken was dry, underseasoned breast. The eggrolls were delicious, the noodles were average at best.

Overall, below average Vietnamese food at higher than usual prices. But big plus for being clean and closer to my house, though. I realize that they need to cater to their customers, so I'm sure it'll be edible if you're not used to the more authentic stuff. 

Next time I'll drive the extra ten minutes."}
{"text":"At last, we found a tasty Vietnamese spot near the west end of the town. This place was as good if not better then any Vietnamese restaurant in town. And it's clean. The egg rolls were really good you can tell they are made in house, not those store bought frozen ones. The pho was so tasty and the broth perfect. The bun thit nuong was just as good and the fish sauce has become one of my favorites. We will be back asap, and since I live close we don't have to drive to China town and chance getting sick."}
{"text":"This place has the best Viet food in Vegas!! We had the Vermacelli Noodle - shrimp & pork w 2 eggs rolls... I order this literally everywhere... And this place has the bestt! Their Pho is super tasty too!! Most importantly this place is super clean!

Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, service was good...just not as clean as I would've wanted. There was left over food debris on the little sauce bowls and my tea cup wasn't properly washed. Looked like they just rinsed it out and put it in the dishwasher, there was leftover tea smudge still in it."}
{"text":"So glad they opened up a pho place closer to my house....really delicious and perfect for a cold day! Will definitely visit more often"}
{"text":"Female server was very unprofessional that throwing dishes to the table! 

They brought a dish first, they brought another dish 30 minutes later and another one was still not one the table yet

Lack of service mind, you should bring all the main meals together!

Also even no servers knew what we ordered for the table! 


Do not go here, very unorganized!
How about the kitchen inside! I ams sure it is very dirty!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The PHO is pretty good.  The staff is nice as well... We will be going back again for sure. I approve this message J K KUHL"}
{"text":"Food was good and delicious, not too much vegetables and have enough tasty marinated well meat. 

Service was fast.

Price is reasonable. 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice intimate hole in the wall mom and pop Pho shop. I only had the Pho, but it was absolutely piping hot deliciousness. They also have bun dishes, com (rice) plates, if it's taste wise to the level of the Pho broth, I'm sure it will taste great. Very traditional Vietnamese Nam people regional food. We also had bun grilled shrimp and egg rolls, and beef jerky papaya salad as well. Thumbs up. I will be back to try the bun bo hue and bun rieu Pho sho! Also the prices are fair, place is nice, clean, great service too. My water was refilled three times so that was excellent. Come eat and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"THM NGON! I may have found my favorite vietnamese spot in Vegas! Located on the corner of Desert Inn & Durango, this place is a hidden gem! I've been going next door for years and I am kicking myself right now for taking this long to try this place!

The venue is a good size, very clean with lots of seating. We came with a party of 12 and were greeted & seated immediately. They have a very extensive and authentic Vietnamese menu... and I can genuinely say everything we ordered not only had great presentation, but tasted just as good! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND: 
- A1, CHA GIO - CRISPY FRIED EGG ROLL ($6.50): shrimp, port, taro root, carrot, onion, rice noodle in a crispy egg roll garnished with large lettuce, mind and a pickle vegetable medley with a side of lime fish sauce (wrap egg roll with lettuce).

{"text":"I go to sidestreet about once per week. The owner is extremely kind and the food always come out fast.

Their egg rolls are delicious.

Their pho is delicious.

You won't be disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Quality is great, location is great to serve the westside residents, service is always great....the pho could use some extra flavor, its on the bland side. The shrimp vermicelli could use improvement...whether its the type of shrimp they are using or the way they prepare, it just doesnt deliver. 

The best dish here for me is the rib eye pho....its a prepare yourself dish, always fresh and always delish."}
{"text":"Found a new discovery i loved it greats service and food is delicious staff pay attention in your order. i totally recommend it. I love it !"}
{"text":"Pho broth has great flavor, overall the rare steak pho that I had was great but the service from the older lady server was not good at all!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho places in Las Vegas absolutely am in love with this place and all other food they have to offer"}
{"text":"I can't get over how bad service is here.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... I don't usually say this but I'm mad I even left a tip... in fact I don't even know why I left a tip.  Long story short we waited a solid 15 minutes after being seated for menus, for menus!

The food is phenomenal is the only reason I don't rate this place lower so kudos to the kitchen staff!  The waitresses were okay but a little lost, the gentleman (waiter) if he chooses to be is just a piece of sheist... sits us down, no menus until I ordered them... then they try taking the order 1 minute after they gave the menus.  Ridiculous.

Oh and expect a most disgusting look on the man's face when you ask for utensils.  Like I can use chopsticks, but my parents can't.  Accommodate them you sheisty fawk.  Straight up just bad service.  Needless to say...

My dad chose a P1 with rare steak, tripe and tendon and he loved it.  Very tasty indeed, the tripe was a tad bit tough but palatable.  My mom ordered the seafood pho (P4) and it was also good lots of seafood goodness perfect for he type of weather (overcast) we're currently having.  I went with the B3 which was the grilled pork and egg rolls (my go to at Viet restaurants for comparison) and I too loved it.  By the way whoever is in charge of the fish sauce, my hat off to you.  Yeah it's a fairly simple sauce but so many places get it wrong by either being too salty or too bland.  I thought it was perfect.

So again waitstaff get a handle on things and keep up with your kitchen staff.  Especially you sir, who shall remain nameless but knows who he is (balding Asian dude)... I feel like I'm owed money for giving you a tip"}
{"text":"Pho is AMAZING! Broth is full of flavor! Wontons packed with meat. Eggrolls are fresh. Everything here is prefectly delicious! Ur tummy will thank u! Awesome service! Love it here, highly recommended for an authentic taste and especially for avoiding strip traffic."}
{"text":"Finally a great Vietnamese restaurant near home! The broth of their pho is so flavorful you really don't need to add anything to it! They use fresh veggies that the greens pop out. Very clean. Staff is very friendly and welcoming continuously checking in on us. Will definitely be our new go to spot for nice Vietnamese soup!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 5 stars solely for the pho. The pho broth is AMAZING and perfection. I can taste more of the beef flavor they put in their soup AND you can tell the beef they use isn't frozen but FRESH. unlike the normal and usual thin sliced brisket cuts , the brisket cuts are thick as ever and they give you a lot too. I've been living in Vegas almost 20 years now , tried most of well rated pho restaurants in this town and In my opinion as far as broth flavor and beef pho goes, this place is hands down the BEST pho in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Pho it has never disappointed us. Relatively  small place but the servers are always nice and the food was delicious the only downside is They don't serve alcohol. Try to get there before 7 o'clock otherwise you'll probably have to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Great food great service friendly staff. From sac and food is better than home. Will repeat when I return. 2 pho nation army ;) Wifey and I"}
{"text":"This place is now under new ownership. The pho is srill delicious and broth excellent!"}
{"text":"I travel for work and eat Pho every week, usually in every place I visit. This is definitely in my top three favorite pho places I have ever eaten at. The broth is full of flavor where you can tell it's a bone broth cooked slow to allow the flavors to deeply infuse. Rice noodles are perfect density. I got chicken and it was tender and perfect. The service was even stellar. Prices are almost too reasonable. I would come to Vegas just to eat here."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place out every time my boyfriend & I get boba next door and so happy to say, WE LOVE IT & WHY THE HELL DID WE WAIT THIS LONG TO TRY IT GEEZ WE DONT KNOW!!

We've been to numerous Vietnamese restaurants in town and I personally have been to a few in other cities and although I know I'm not an expert, I must say I enjoy Vietnamese food a lot lot lot. In other places, service and food are mediocre and I kind of got used to that so when we had such a nice reception here and tried the delicious food, I was ecstatic.

We were greeted and seated right away and can I just say the decor is adorable! I ordered the Grilled Pork Spring Roll, Vermicelli Bowl with Grilled Pork and Egg Rolls while the main squeeze ordered the Combo Pho with everything on it. They both came loaded with the usual veggies and the portions are huge! I usually wouldn't finish my food and take some to-go but my bowl was so good, I wiped it clean. So did my boyfriend.. but then again, he always finishes his food so nvm. Lol. 

We can't wait to come back & try other dishes. :)"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was bangin! If you enjoy Pho, definitely check this restaurant out. Decor is very cool & comfortable."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after hearing/knowing about this place for the longest time. I live super close nearby (like a 2 minute drive) but haven't came here before. Both my friend and I had not eaten dinner so decided to come here since it was nearby

This specific location has changed ownerships/names/etc quite the few times in the past but it seems like this restaurant has been doing well. Surprisingly easy life still exists next door Lol xD 

Décor hasn't changed since the last owner but they changed the layout a bit. I think they put a drink station or something in the dining room, side closest to the streets. 

Since the weather is getting warmer by the day, we both were kind of craving something not so hot. Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. One of my favorite things to get in terms of viet food. Granted this location is a little away from the main \"Chinatown\" or Asian area so their prices are a little bit higher than others. For this specific dish, it was $10 each. Brief glance over the pho's they were a little more pricey too. 

Service wise, they were pretty fast. We were sat down at a table almost as soon as we arrived. Waters were brought out quickly and our orders were taken. 

Surprisingly it didn't take long for them to bring out the food too. The restaurant wasn't completely full but they weren't dead either. Maybe give or take 50% capacity? Granted it was dinner time but not bad. 

Their version of bun thit nuong cha gio is a fairly good size, in appearance. Topped with 2 cut egg rolls, a metal cup of their fish sauce, pile of bbq pork, some cooked chopped green onions, shredded pickled carrots, and carrots. All these on top of a bed of vermicelli noodles with a bed of mainly bean sprouts before that. Overall, taste wise was not bad. The thit nuong (bbq pork) was a little overcooked but nicely. The amount of bean sprouts on the bottom was a bit much. More used to more of a \"chopped greens\" with some bean sprouts vs almost entire bean sprouts. The best part is the cha gio (egg rolls). Though they aren't the best I've had, they are one of the very few that use taro in the filling. Flavor is light. My friend didn't even notice until after I mentioned it. Do love viet style egg rolls in general. With and without. But it was surprising they did theirs with. 

Overall, not bad. Maybe like to try their pho or their broken rice plates in the future. 

Side note - I used to purchase these \"big bao\" from a person who made them from home. I heard she now does them at this restaurant. Granted they are pricier now but they were yummy."}
{"text":"That beef pho broth wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. The pho noodle was definitely different than what I'm used to. It had a scent to it and it affected the broth. They do provide a lot of protein if you do get the combination pho."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The pho actually tastes homemade. The broth is rich and tastes like its freshly made with more oxtail than pho powder. The spring rolls were excellent and made with leaf lettuce. Sauce was very good as well. Most importantly, the place was clean. Bathroom was clean. Floors were clean, and tables and condiment containers were all clean. This type of cleanliness is what I wish more Vietnamese restaurants would emulate. Owner was friendly and service was quick!"}
{"text":"I really didn't like my veggie pho. No matter how I flavored the broth I couldn't save it from it's own mediocrity. Another thing I disliked was that they gave me two small cubes of tofu and that was it. The value wasn't there.

The egg rolls, however, were good. 

The servers were nice too. 

I might give it another try."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fairly polite staff, fairly clean. I like the location, too."}
{"text":"Best customer service I have ever seen at a Vietnamese restaurant. The food came out pretty fast and was delicious. I ordered the báng xèo, was one of the best I ever had. I would most definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I consider myself a pho expert for not being Viet. I've had pho in 15 states and counting and let me say Sidestreet pho was amazing. Great service, blazing fast food, and it was delicious. And unlike some pho places I've been to the waitress understood my order in Viet. I'll always come back here everytime I go to Vegas"}
{"text":"Was once the best...Now that the previous owner sold it, the new owners have managed to trash the food. They said the same cook but I can't believe that's true. Went last night and found the vibe totally different, the food bordering on flavorless (the wings now just taste like salt, fake crab and tasteless fishballs in the pho), the waitress bordering on nasty and the whole deal made it so I'll never return. Farewell Sidestreet....Anyone have any idea where Ken landed?"}
{"text":"Great priced food and service was fast! The food was great, aside from a few bad pieces of meat, and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place my favorite pho place 
Love the egg rolls and the rib eye pho is so good 
Owners r great always there"}
{"text":"Loved the Pho !! Thought it was very good although his kids were sitting at the table watching their iPads way to loud !! The fried rice was amazing and service was great !!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here with my family and this was a pretty good place. This place is near home than the one i used to go to. My family wanted to try a new place and this was to our expectations. This may be our new go to place for pho because its convenient and tastes great. We ordered the make your own pho and the broth and meat was good. We also got spring roll and egg roll were decent like the ones you would get almost everywhere."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because it had 4 1/2 stars. I looked at the menu and it looked enticing.  We ordered Pho and Wonton soups, fresh spring rolls and fried egg rolls. The soups were just average and the flavors were not rich to begin with. Even adding all the veggies and spices couldn't give it the rich flavors we were looking for.  The fresh spring rolls were lacked crunch and the peanut sauce needed more hoisin sauce.  The fried spring rolls had a weird texture and the flavor was not good.  The sauce was was lacking in fish sauce as well. I would not recommend this place based on my first visit.  The place was packed and I wonder if they were tasting the same flavors as me."}
{"text":"This new Vietnamese restaurant serves authentic vm dishes. We tried the BBH, Bo coh banh mi (beef strew with baguette), Com Dia (rice with grilled pork), gia gio, wonton noodle soup and flan. Every dishes have great flavor and were good portion size. My parents grew up in Vietnam and are very picky when it comes to Vm food. When the BBH arrived, they tried the broth and immediately said it was good and authentic flavor because of the Mam tam (shrimp paste). Before the beef stew came on the table, I could already smell it from distance. It was soooo good! I highly recommend it.
The flan was a good surprise for us. The caramel was cooked to perfection and the flan was very silky and smooth.
Service was friendly and efficient. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas!  Loved the food and the service was amazing. Super friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! My husband and I dine here quite frequently and I always get the combination pho."}
{"text":"Soup was flavorful pork was dry and veggies were def not on the fresh side. Service was a little lacking. But overall was ok. Never came. Ask to fill water or tea."}
{"text":"Not the best. 

My first visit here and it may be my last. I came here for lunch today, and went straight to the cashier area to order take out and the older guy behind the counter barely acknowledged me. 

I only ordered one thing.. banh mi beef sandwich. I told them no jalapeños. And of course the first thing I see when I open up my food.. jalapeños. The bread was not fresh, very chewy in a bad way. I do like how they sliced the beef thin, but it was also very dry.  

I may just stick to Hue Thai in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall places because it never ceases to amaze me how spectacular the food will be. As I walked in the restaurant, I was greeted with friendly smiles and nods, the waitress seated us and provided us with the menu and recommendations. Tonight I feasted on pho tom; an aromatic soup with a burst of herbs and spices. The table was presented with a shabu shabu where you cook your own meat to your likeing. This shrimp soup was so fulfilling and satisfying... definitly a place to go when you are feeling under the weather."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough nice things about this place me and my husband go there on a regular basis every time I'm sick and I don't feel good I go there and therefore makes me feel fantastic with all of my health problems I'm going to go there and get comfort food is absolutely wonderful"}
{"text":"My husband is a pho junky, so we've eaten at pretty much every pho joint in town. This is by far my favorite for so many reasons. The noodles are always cooked properly and the broth tastes like it's been slow cooked for DAYS. The pork sandwich is served with crisp vegetables on a delicious baguette. The egg rolls are always hot and fresh. And if you want to mix it up, the Huang Chow fried rice is uniquely spiced and satisfying. On top of the delicious food, the customer service is impeccable. Every time we dine, the owner is there - it's like he's never had a day off. The wait staff is quick, friendly, and helpful. Now I have two toddlers who are obsessed with \"noo noos\" as well :) Great neighborhood feel, great food, and great staff."}
{"text":"I found this rare, good Vietnamese Restaurant, three years ago.
And just this year, this was my first time to eat there.
The owners did change the name of the place.

It was quite busy when we arrived around late noon,
We were lucky to get a table. Customer service was mediocre.
The Food service was quick. 

I ordered my favorite,  BUN  GRILLED CHICKEN VERMICELLI
BOWL...it was really delicious..

 I would come here again, because they have take out orders,
 I think."}
{"text":"So far this is the best pho I've ever had in my life... Jimmy, you were wonderful! Will definitely be back again!(:"}
{"text":"Good pho place but not great. Been here a few times and it seems that the cook is very inconsistent with the amount of meat they put in the pho. One day they put a lot and another day they barely have meat in them. For a $10.50 pho soup I expect to get a good amount of meat. Overall this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"The best pho restaurant in Vegas. Restaurant is super clean. The service is fast and the staff is very friendly. The pho is absolutely delicious with generous portions and reasonable price."}
{"text":"New restaurant, a bit understaffed and unorganized. Our orders were incomplete and confused with different items in the menu. 

I had the Beef Stew and the taste was spicy and flavorful. Mostly fat in the stew and very little meat, though. 

My friend got the Veniceli which was very tasty.

Costumer service was great, even though there was lack of organiztion. The manager was very apologetic for missing some items in our order, and offered discount. 

I believe hiring more staff and organizing their orders will help this business succeed. Potential is there for good Vietnamese food in this area."}
{"text":"This place is not by Chinatown at all but it's so yummy.  The service was amazing and they actually do speak English. Lol.  It's not super traditional Vietnamese because they have more selection and different dishes here.  Love this place."}
{"text":"The pho was great and the vermicelli bowl as well. Service was really fast and our server Nero was really nice and funny! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"When I went here it had 5 stars and I was pretty excited about that and being close to home, decided to try it out. With Vietnamese food my regular order would be bun thit nuong or pho tai or fresh spring rolls, so over the years I have been able to compare better tasting ones and not so good ones. 

I ordered the bun thit nuong. My hubby ordered a thai iced tea and grilled pork chop. After they took our order, it was not less than a minute that my hubby's food came out. I literally told the guy \"oh no, this must not be our order because we just ordered less than a minute ago.\" He went back to check and sure enough it was. Hmmmm...ok so I don't know if this is how most Vietnamese restaurants work (pre cooked pork chop)?? But I can only imagine it dries out that way? and how long as it been sitting there??My hubby has been ordering this same dish for years at every Vietnamese restaurant we go to and I've never seen food brought out this quick. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Fast service is one thing, but that was clearly not the case. It was food that had been sitting there. He did not like his food. 

The next thing that I feel this restaurant needs to work is how to deal with a bloody finger and a dirty band-aid. What I mean by that is our server had a bloody finger (some sort of wound) that was pretty big (about a 1 inch cut oozing with blood to the point where I could see it. The band-aid was not fresh (you know when it is tightly wrapped around and dry looking). This band-aid looked as if he possibly wore it all day or washed his hands with it. When he set down my hubby's food I could see the blood on his finger and band-aid half falling off. I would think there is some health requirement about wounds and how to properly cover them when serving food???

The thai iced tea came in a  small glass in which water is served. Everyone around us had a mason jar with their thai iced tea, not sure why we did not get one. Filled with ice, my husband got 3 sips of thai iced tea. 

My bun thit nuong came 10 minutes after my husband's food (I guess they actually cooked the meat on mine). It has bland and I did not enjoy it. 

They also messed up our order and charged us for food we did not order. Of course they fixed it. 

2 stars for my food
1 star for my husband's pre cooked pork chop
0 stars for the bloody finger and dirty loose band-aid"}
{"text":"great food and service.  found our new pho spot near summerlin.  no need to go all the way down to china town or spring mountain for some legit soup.  seated right away and followed up a couple of times for refills and check ins.  

you can choose your 3 meats with your soup.  genius!

will go back and visit frequently everytime we want some vietnamese food nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, the staff is very respectful and ensures a good dining experience for all patrons. 

The Banh Mi sandwich (grilled chicken) was delicious, but kind of small for $5.95. 

The combination Pho was good, but not a memorable experience like I have had at Kim Long. The spring roll was fresh and decent. 

I will be back here again due to the attentiveness of the staff. They deserve my business and I hope they stick around for many years to come. I know that Restaurant business in very tough and everyday is about survival for these folks. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pho. One thing I really like about the menu is the build-your-own option. It's either a small size or large and it comes with 3 meat choices out of the 8 they have. 

I enjoy tripe in my pho and lately most places I've been to doesn't really do it to my liking. But Sidestreet's tripe was tender and had the right amount to it, in ratio with the brisket I added to my bowl. 

The Vietnamese iced coffee I had was tasty and actually tasted like coffee and not just sugar. It's pretty strong too, so I recommend you don't have it when you plan on sleeping early. 

One funny note: our waiter was really attentive and conversational. As he was refilling our waters, a couple came in at 9pm, and hour before closing on a Saturday night. And he mentions to us, \"here's a tip, don't come in the last hour before closing because we will curse at you in a language you will not understand.\" I found it funny, but most people would be triggered at the fact; I admired his honesty. 

Bookmarked this place because I plan on going again."}
{"text":"Everyone knows if you're trying to get some good pho, head over to spring mountain, but let's face it, nobody wants to deal with that traffic, limited parking or crazier drivers. 
Our second time here and it's safe to say I've found my go to spot. It's always tough for me not to order pho whenever I'm at a Vietnamese place, so I did the build your own, double the brisket + beef ball. Their brisket is amazing, has enough fat and easily falls apart, order it if you get the chance :) 
Their broth is whatever, but it's the brisket that had me ordering their pho again. 

My boyfriend ordered (B3)Grilled Lemongrass Pork & Egg Rolls Rice Noodle and I had instant remorse on my order. Bummed I didn't get a photo of it, but it was a solid amount of food. 

The service is pretty quick, gone during a lunch hour and late at night."}
{"text":"Normally, the thought of Pho is only mildly interesting to me and I would never go out of my way to have some. This may have changed after my first experience in Sidestreet Pho! Just walking in the front door envelops you in the delicious aroma of pho and other savory scents. I was very impressed by how delicious the broth is - as well as the friendly service and nice decor. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food was so so. Sat down waited 10m for menus,  another 15m to order,  and 15m just to get the check.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese Coffee is freshly brewed and delicious. It's smoky flavor is greatly enhanced by the milk they provide as it is prepared at your table. The staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual lunch or dinner  Inside the place is decorated to look like a real Side Street restaurant. Offering several types of Pho  and traditional dishes. My favorites are the Largeeeeee Brisket Pho, Num, Num, Num 

I also like the Chinese Sausage Fry Rice  

The staff is friendly and the have an array of different drink options including fresh Coconuts  

Check it out."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in Vegas. Everyone is nice, food's great. Broth is awesome, meat is good. Only criticism would be when trying to pay. I've been there before when after we were done eating and ready to pay but were a little confused about how. Weren't sure if you have to pay at the register or with server. Just felt a little ignored a couple times after eating. Still highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ate here in LV.  Good pho with good ingredients and acceptable service.  (I drink a lot of water and get annoyed when I have an empty cup) Price and portions were good and I enjoyed a good hot bowl of beef combo pho!"}
{"text":"I keep this place in my back pocket for when I get my monthly jones for pho ga. I've eaten at Lilly's a few times, it's good but this place seems super legit. Being fairly new to Vegas, I usually assess the quality of an ethnic food joint by the ratio of people of that ethnicity to others and it always seems to work out well. Obviously the locals looking for good food they know well or grew up with all have the 411 on the hip spots. 
This place is no exception, it comes close to the quality of the super-native Viet spots in Cali I go to when visiting family that are so ethnic the owners barely speak English. Like I said, that strategy always pays off and I'm glad I found Sidestreet, especially as it's only a mile or two from my hut. They have the food ready fast and hot, and have some of the better thai iced tea I've had. Most places in town that offer it have no idea how to make it properly. The only downside here is the crappy parking and crowded lot it shares with a strip mall complex by Vons. I usually just take out as it's hard to find a seat sometimes at night when it's busy. Definitely worth a visit if you've never tried the food here."}
{"text":"Sidestreet Pho would be my definition of a modern, \"hip\" pho place. We ordered the Bo Kho (sidestreet beef stew) with a baguette and Pho Tai (pho with rare steak). I asked for the rare steak on the side so that it doesn't cook too much in the broth before I eat it.

I asked the difference between the medium and large bowl hoping to get an idea of approximate size (every restaurant definitely varies). The server gave me the vague answer of \"large is good when you're hungry but if you're not very hungry medium will still fill you up\". I got absolutely nothing from that and wished he would have just gestured the approximate size with his hands. Anyways, I just settled on the large since I was going to share with my boyfriend. 

Onto the food: The baguette from the Bo Kho was very good. It was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The beef from this dish was pretty tender also. It's sooo delicious dipping the baguette into the dish. The large Pho Tai was a pretty good portion of pho. The soup was delicious as always. It was enough to share between my boyfriend and me. I did wish, however, that they gave me more Thai basil leaves and limes for the amount of pho I had. I got my water refilled which warrants a notable mention. The service wasn't amazing, but it wasn't lacking either. 

P.S. I also like that this is away from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the food and the service from ONE employee (the gentleman w/ the bun/topknot). Their food is good but they forgot our appetizers. We all finished our meals and still no appetizers. When I asked for help, the lady put her finger up at me (like wait, while she gave another table their check), then when I told her we never received our spring rolls or egg rolls, she yelled out in Vietnamese who was helping this table, they don't have their appetizers! The employee who took our order (Minh) came over & blatantly told us no we never ordered appetizers. I understand forgetting our order (even though it wasn't busy and no rush) but to sit there & accuse us of lying/never ordering our food is despicable. They all need to take a lesson on proper customer service from the one employee who actually knew what he was doing."}
{"text":"So disappointing--nothing was fresh. The noodles were clumped together, the basil was wilted, and the broth was too sweet. There weren't enough noodles. Did I come on a bad day? It's a Sunday. It wasn't busy, but no one came by to give our bill. I saw others before us get their bill. We just went up and paid. Maybe this place is good for the other food, but not for the pho. We came here because it got really good reviews on Yelp, but I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly. I had the pho with brisket and flank. Best veggie egg rolls !! A must have."}
{"text":"Vegetable egg rolls are delish!

Had the vegetable pho with tofu carrots bok choy and broccoli and it's def the best I've ever had the broth is delicious and it all taste so fresh! Great food and great service will def be back"}
{"text":"This is our go to. Hangover? Go to.
Cold outside? Go to. Light lunch? Go to.
Wanna clear the sinuses? Go to.
Delicious broth here. Always fresh.
And the picked jalapenos make the soup even better. This place is Pho-sho gonna make your vegas top pho spots.
Give it a go."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I love the food. I've tried a lot of pho places and their pho is by far the best I've tried in Vegas. Me and friends come here very often and the service is very good!! I only wish the Thai tea and sodas were free refills :( but that won't make me stop coming here!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever!! I ordered for take out and was told it'll be ready in 10 minutes. Waited for half hour and it's still not ready. I asked the guy twice and he kept telling me it's almost ready and that was 15-20 minutes ago. I walked out and went to Lily 's Thai and Vietnamese, which was just across the parking lot on the other side of the Plaza. I placed my orders and within 10 minutes, I was out of the restaurant. No regrets at all because the food tasted so much better than Side Street. The Pho is amazing  and the crab fried rice is out of this world I've never tasted such flavorful fried rice before. This is it!!  No more Side Street"}
{"text":"Pho and fried rice are delicious BUT they take forever to bring anything out... slow service as well so if you want to wait 30min to receive your food then come to this place. Servers also need to be trained better to be more attentive"}
{"text":"I love this place. The veggie pho is our favorite! My husband mentioned he would get more veggies next time but its great that we can just add on for an extra $2. I thought there was enough of everything. The service is good too. I choose to eat here even though we have a pho place down the street. Good job guys! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"We ate here today for the first time and it won't be the last.  The pho was excellent, spring rolls were great and staff was very friendly and helped make our choices.  Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"This place is the closest Pho place to me. It's super cute on the inside. Food is great! Waiters are kind and friendly. Food is fast. It doesn't look like your average pho restaurant and is a little more expensive then your average pho place. And they don't have BOBA haha which is one of my faves. However, if boba is needed there is a yummy place right next door. Anyway, the only thing I I think needs to be worked on is for the waiters to know their menu. If I had my own restaurant I would make sure everyone knows what we have and what it takes like. When we asked out waiter about their chicken wings for one of the kids what kind of wings they were he said he didn't know. We asked are they hot, mild? He again said I don't know they only come in one flavor. So to me that is a big deal. Know your menu! Other than that we loved it and the food was great!"}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best Pho in Las Vegas. I would give it 5 star rating for taste of broth and high quality meat. The Com bi soun noung was excellent and had a lot of great flavor. The pork chops were perfectly done with the lemongrass flavor and the rice and the shredded pork was perfect in taste. The service was Top Notch and they were spot-on with making sure our food was out on time and that we were happy with our food as well as filling up our drinks and bringing us plenty of utensils and napkins. Staff was very friendly and I would definitely recommend this place for some of the best Vietnamese food here in Las Vegas. This place is my new favorite Vietnamese Restaurant. Try and see what everyone is raving about. My family and I plan on coming back real soon to try the Bun Bo Hue and Com Bo Luc Lac and a Bahn Mi. We had family in town so taking my Sister and her husband here was a real treat for them and our family."}
{"text":"This place has decent pho. We were trying to go to a different restaurant in the same plaza, but it was closed. The pho was pretty flavorful, it just came out lukewarm when pho should always be piping hot. The meat rice plate was also pretty delicious. Decent prices too, would reccomend."}
{"text":"I had the Grilled Pork Fresh Spring Rolls and a Fresh Baguette with Grilled Beef (Banh Mi). The Banh Mi is a little different than most places because mayonnaise is added. Nonetheless, food is fresh and yum yum"}
{"text":"Yelped This place, We Had A Hankering For Pho And This Place Did Not disappoint us. Ordered grilled pork chop plate and seafood soup pho,  it hit the spot.. i would recommended this place for sure. Owner and server were very nice..."}
{"text":"This is a little gem of a Vietnamese place! The interior is decorated to resemble an outdoor courtyard, with plant accents. In addition to pho and the usual Vietnamese staples, there is also a section of street foods like the stuffed buns. Affordable pricing.

FRESH SPRING ROLLS, order of two with shrimp is $4 and they are stuffed with noodles, shrimp, and herbs, peanut sauce on the side.
STUFFED BUN with egg and pork is surprisingly tasty, and also low-priced at $2 for a filling snack or appetizer.
VERMICELLI BOWL WITH GRILLED PORK AND SPRING ROLL: Huge portion, enough noodles for two meals for $8.50! Pork had good char and flavor, spring roll was nicely crispy. Large cup of fish sauce, small container of chili for additional seasoning.

I will be back for dine-in or takeout. They do have a street wok section of the menu that is currently unavailable, but they have plenty of options for a large group to be satisfied. Very friendly and attentive service throughout my visit."}
{"text":"I love this place-- hands down the best pho in Vegas. The broth is delicious, smooth, and perfectly season and salted. This is my go-to place for pho. The service is exceptional and I have never had a bad experience here. I recommend  it to everyone who is looking for pho."}
{"text":"Sidestreet Pho is the absolute best Pho in Las Vegas!  Everything is made in house & fresh!  We started out with house made fried won ton that was crunchy & had a sweet/spicy sauce. They were outstanding!  I then had brisket, flank & rare beef pho & my companion had the shrimp pho. The whole dinner was $30 & was awesome!  Do yourself a favor & visit this place!"}
{"text":"Favorite Pho place on the SW side of town by far! The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and their food is always served w/quality and promptness."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we give this place a try, good food and good service, everything we order was tasty and satisfying, worth of a drive"}
{"text":"So glad this place is close to home! Been here a few times and I'm happy to say their food is always consistent. You can't go wrong with their pho (I like the combination pho) and the rice dishes are good choices too. When I'm feeling extra hungry, I'll order the fried egg rolls which always hit the spot. Service has been great the multiple times I've been. They also do a great job of keeping the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"I was on a search for a new pho location. Found Sidestreet on Yelp and couldn't be happier!!!!  Fresh Vietnamese coffee, beef pho, homemade flan! Close to home, near the gym, and worth the trip"}
{"text":"We walked in just before closing because we weren't sure what time they closed and we were greeted with a smile and seated. We weren't rushed. The food was delicious. Ken the owner (I think) was super gracious as was the rest of the staff. Clean, good food, hospitable, and open later than the other Vietnamese places in the area. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Delicious! We started off with the papaya salad with shrimp and pork. This salad was so crisp, delicious and refreshing. We also had the fried egg rolls with this delicious sweet dipping sauce. Main course... shrimp fried rice, a rice plate with pork, pork skin , pork meatloaf and a bowl of seafood pho. This mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese food is absolutely fabulous! Our server was so nice and very helpful. I'm going to guarantee you will love this place. The decor was so cute also!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent noodle soup! The broth seemed like it had been simmering all day. The Pho Tai had plenty of well trimmed beef. Very tasty! Good Thai Iced Tea. Very quick, friendly service. Food was served FAST!

Yes, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Egg rolls 3 star
Grilled pork spring rolls 1 star, pork was dry and not very good
Combo pho 3 star your basic meat cuts but the chef decided he was too lazy to cut bite sized pieces of tendon and meatballs. I am not sure you could fit the tendon In your mouth and not choke. The broth wasn't hot enough. As soon as you put the veggies in it became lukewarm.
Clear noodle soup 1 star, noodles were not fully cooked and the broth was pretty bland. The pork used was just boiled and put in. 

Price is zero stars. It is over priced for what you get. They were too lazy to give me a seperate veggie dish for my soup.

I will not be returning. The waitress is unhappy and makes it annoying to even be there to have to put up with her attitude. She literally threw straws at me when I asked for some."}
{"text":"Had takeout from here.  Order was correct and food was tasty. Good vegetarian options.  Pot stickers were good, but deep fried (and I prefer steamed).  Vietnamese coffee was tasty.  Would order again."}
{"text":"We ordered P1 with tripe, rare steak, and tendon and P7 Vegetable Pho with Beef broth.  The Pho broth just wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping.  We read a lot of reviews and there was a mix of comments about the Pho.  When we walked in, the smell is amazing, just wish the food was as good.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from this westside pho restaurant away from the bustle of Chinatown. The 3 choice meat  pho was very delicious. The broth was tasty and hot just how I like it. The only complaint would be the dirty Hoisin sauce bottle(pet peeve of mine) and plastic chopsticks."}
{"text":"Food was a good price and very yummy :). I had egg noodles with dumplings, pork, all the toppings and it tasted good."}
{"text":"Really good pho & wonton soup! Great service :). Jasmine tea was fragrant & delicious :)"}
{"text":"Pretty pho-king good! I ordered for delivery one cold weekend night via Grub Hub. My order was simple; pho with brisket and rare steak, and an order of the Chinese sausage fried rice. My total was less than $20. The delivery time was quoted 50 mins, but they got there in 30. Everything was piping hot. The pho came in its own separate container and the meat, noodles and condiments came in a separate box. Condiments included a container of fish sauce, a sriracha packet, basil, lime, onions, jalapenos and bean sprouts. It was very good. 

The fried rice was great. It had tons of flavor and the sausage was a nice addition. Even my son liked it! The only downside was it was a bit too oily, but still delicious nonetheless. I would not hesitate to order from here again to satisfy my pho craving."}
{"text":"Came here the other night. I was a little skeptical since it wasn't busy. We ordered the chicken pho and the rare steak beef pho. Generous portions and man was it good. Probably the best beef pho I've ever had. Service was average but I really didn't mind since the food was so good. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the service is beyond horrible. Any time that I asked for something they just respond yah  yah yah and wonder off. With so many great Pho places in Vegas I would skip this one."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Vietnamese spots close to Sunmerlin. Their bahn mi and spring rolls are some of my favorite. The staff is always friendly and efficient.  Chinatown is too far to drive to sometimes so I'm glad this place is so close to the house."}
{"text":"Wow! Fresh food .. Authentic Vietnamese cooks that cook authentic Vietnamese food & to top it off the service was actually really good (Phuong was a server) ..  I'm used to the Chinatown pho, you know .. The mediocre service, dirty atmosphere, and so so pho.. This place definitely exceeded our expectations .. Come try this place if your on the Westside !"}
{"text":"PHO? On the west side? Wha? 

I love having this pho place right by home! Sometimes it's just a pain driving down Spring Mountain for some pho. Plus this place is pretty good. 

The ambience here is very different from the other pho places. It's actually decorated and feels clean. They even use mason jars as their cups which is hip and cool. 

I ordered Bon Bu Hue and it was pretty good! Could be a lot spicier and but I liked it! Austin ordered the custom pho. You can choose up to three toppings and it comes in a small or large. I tried his pho and it was flavorful and had lots of noodles! 

One thing I didn't really like was their buns. It was kinda weird and wasn't like the other buns I'm use to. It had a meat ball thing with a boiled egg in it. 

Other than that I loved it here and will be coming back."}
{"text":"We honestly only go here for one thing - their crispy egg rolls.  We've tried some of their pho and other menu items and have enjoyed them, but most of the things they make we have found other places that we enjoy them better.  That said, they have absolutely PERECTED the crispy egg roll and so you MUST MUST MUST try this item if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"I frequently dine here and have been pleased.  I brought my whole family here for Mother's Day lunch, 9 of us. Our foods came at different times.  Everyone was very hungry so ended up sharing foods as they bring to our table.  It was hard for us to track what was delivered because we're all reaching for each other's foods.  When we got home, we realized they didn't deliver two dishes that we paid for.   It's quite disappointing from a place that I love."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! This is my go to place when it comes to pho. I've tried other places and nothing compares to them! Excellent food and good customer service!"}
{"text":"We always go here with the kids when we are super hungry. Not because it's over the top good, it's because the location is so close to us, and we would rather go here than go all the way to Chinatown. It is a good amount of soup but the noodles don't seem like enough. The flavors are very tasty and they don't skimp on meats. The spring rolls seem small but they too, are delicious. This is our close to home pho place."}
{"text":"This has become our new place for pho! The food is great, the customer service is on point always doing refills and checking on tables. We mainly ordered vegetarian food and everything we have tried is really good."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I'm not use to eating Phó. But my wife enjoys it. It's the new year and we both have been eating good. So on Saturday's we have a cheat meal. I'm really glad we decided to stop here. My wife ate her raw steak phó and I had the pork chop with fried pig skins and some kind of egg dish. 
This establishment was very well decorated and there was nice scenery of Las Vegas out the south east windows."}
{"text":"Best pho you can get on the west side of town! Love their shrimp spring rolls and rare steak pho!"}
{"text":"Really amazing Vietnamese food here. I'm really impressed. I'm from the Bay Area where there are many such establishments serving pho. However, this restaurant has the best pho I've ever tried- the beef noodle soup is extremely flavorful with lots of meat inside. Probably the best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to. With most places I either feel that there's too much soup and too little meat, or the soup isn't flavorful, or it is full of MSG instead of actual bone flavor, or the chef skipped a few steps in order to produce more soup at a cheaper cost. Not so with this place. So impressed!"}
{"text":"Service was good the owner is funny and very friendly. Food was good we ordered the porkchop rice Combo with fried egg the pork chop was a thin slice the fried eggrolls were a little on the overcooked side. I would give it another try and come back for other items on the menu the owner mentioned he has new dishes that they are adding on."}
{"text":"Since they didn't ask me how it was... here's my voluntary review:

how do you know a relationship is at its caliber? when both parties are able to withstand all obstacles, right?


well, for me, it was cold and windy and about 9:50pm when my friends and i decided to go to the nearest pho place next to our house. luckily Sidestreet closes at 10:30pm, so we got there, got sat, and ordered by the time is was 10.05pm. my two friends barely opened their menu, and the lady already was trying to take their order. 

my one star represents that our soup came out fast and they weren't blatantly rude--at best.

when we got our soup, it wasn't even that hot, it was barely warm. i assure you, the meat was decent but the soup wasn't hot, therefore the pho wasn't the best experience. the staff didn't even come over to see if our empty cups needed refills. granted, they're closing up and setting up other tables taking care of other things. i noticed the staff greeting nicely to others but just because we were the last ones there just ten passed closing, not the same type of \"genuine\" service, as if we're a burden. [insert big eyed-emojicon here] Not a big deal for you, just for me. On that note, i'll just make my way to spring mountain where im worth their business. 

our customer relationship was not at its caliber. case closed."}
{"text":"We are new customers, have been there twice in 5 days.  This is a casual dining experience .  We have found the food delicious and the service solicitous and engaging.  We will be returning and often."}
{"text":"I had the S1 with three meat combination pho. Noticed, hardly any of the meat ordered. However, the restaurant and atmosphere are very pleasant. Service is courteous and with a smile."}
{"text":"Good for close neighborhood pho. Been about five times. The food is good, service is meh. The most recent time there was a piece of chicken in my wife's vegetable pho, besides that minor hiccup the place has been exceptional."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho. I had the Veggie pho while my dad got beef. The broth was solid and the appetizers were good. Service was REALLY lacking though. The young  waitress just gave us menus and forgot we even existed. Even when we tried to get her attention she would come to our table so we had to go to the hostess station and tell her that we wanted to order our food. She eventually disappeared to the back and a young man took our order and brought out or drinks. He was probably the only one of the front of house staff doing any work. An older waitress brought the wrong food to our table (without saying a word) and simply walked off. Luckily, the young man was able to get the right food to our table.

It's a shame because the food is good but I don't think I'll be back due to the slow (and lack of) service."}
{"text":"So decided to change up my normal Pho spot plus was in need place to review. SIdestreet Pho and Grill was one that keep passing by and during these chilly winter nights. It was on..

The first visit went little different direction tried the Sidestreet Beef Stew. I was not sure the noodles out of three choices. The server recommending the Egg Noodle. It was spot on with the noodle choice. Overall really enjoy the broth. It was hearty with decent amount of beef and lot of stuff in it. The egg noodle rounded out the dish. Again hearty amount of noodle in the bowl. I got order of the traditional fresh shrimp and pork spring roll. It was refreshing. My second visit went with traditional Pho Dac Biet. I got the special combo. It has all the different meat options. Again just like the beef stew enjoy the broth, hearty, nice portion of noodles, and perfect dish on cold Vegas night. 

The service was fabulous both visits. Mention earlier my first visit got great recommendation on decided my noodle. They were on it the whole time. 

Sidestreet Pho and Grill got added too my spots comes to good bowl of Pho!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from LA and decided to get some pho on our last day. We ordered the grilled pork spring rolls and pho with rare steak, tripe, tendon, and beef balls. Everything tasted very clean and flavorful. We didn't get that MSG aftertaste in the broth which was a plus. However, the soup to noodle ratio was off so there wasn't enough soup to cook the bean sprouts down so our bowls cooled down very quickly.

All in all, service here is excellent, the restaurant itself is very well-kept, and you'll get a decent bowl of pho. Worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Always good food and good people taking care of ya! The pho is excellent as is the Vietnamese crepes and egg rolls ... everything is good so give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to have this open up next to easy life. It is right around the corner from my house, and the best pho place within five miles. Getting a hot pho thai and a good bahn mi on a cold night is now only steps away. It used to be a whole trip where you needed the excuse of a group of friends going in order to make the trek. That said, if I have a group of people I don't usually come here. I prefer the China Town places, like Pho Saigon 8 and Viet Noodle Bar, but only by the slightest amount. If you are on this side of town, you owe yourself to try this place if only to save your gas on those night where you need some pho but not the company of five other people."}
{"text":"I haven't had pho for over a month since moving to Vegas. After dealing with a stressful day at work today, I was really craving some comfort food. (I'm not Vietnamese but I kinda wish I was, because then I'd have grown up with pho and could have it at home.) I yelped pho places and Sidestreet popped up with excellent reviews. 

Yelp informed me that they closed at 10:00pm and I wasn't sure if they'd be okay with us sitting down to eat, since I had gotten off work at 9:15 and by the time we got there it was past 9:30. We walked in prepared to settle for takeout. However, the waiter was very accommodating and gave us a table and menus and water right away. 

My bf and I both ordered the \"make your own pho\" option, his with rare beef steak and mine with steak and beef balls. It was out within five minutes. Soup was hot, noodles tasted very fresh, broth was DELICIOUS. I usually have to put a lot of hoisin sauce and sriracha in my broth, but theirs is so flavorful that I probably could have gone without the condiments. Lots of beansprouts for us to share, which is a huge plus for me. Hate it when pho joints skimp on the veggies. 

I see that their spring rolls have good reviews; we're going back to try them very soon. (Didn't want to make them cook too much, since the kitchen was almost ready to close.) 

Very good pho at under $20 for two people. I know where I'm coming to get my fix now!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I'm a vegetarian and they are very vegetarian friendly. They have vegetarian pho, vegetable broth, vegetarian potstickers and egg rolls! Super good, definitely recommend it this place."}
{"text":"When it comes to pho I have tried many places.  Side street is not only one of the most flavorful but it was not loaded with msg.  The staff was knowledgeable and very pleasant to talk with.  I will be recommending this to all my clients.."}
{"text":"Summary: I really liked the flavor. 

We walked in around 7pm on a Tuesday and all the tables were packed except 1. Shortly after we sat, the line out the door started. I noticed the men working the restaurant didn't really have assigned areas, thus seemed a bit disorganized.  BUT the flavor was amazing!!! I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and my husband ordered the pork and shrimp fried rice. 

The dishes came out very separately so my husband  finished eating before my soup arrived. 

Other than the disorganizedness of the restaurant, I'd definitely come back for the Bun Bo Hue!"}
{"text":"This is an affordable, quick, and yummy spot to grab Vietnamese outside of Chinatown.  Although I've had better egg rolls/imperial rolls, the pho was pretty good and the vermicelli bowl was pretty standard.  We were a group of three and ate for under $30!  We will definitely be back, especially since it's not too far from our hood.  No-frills service, but speedy!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here to eat recently and the food was delicious! Restaurant was very clean, service was good, and the food was very fresh and yummy! We ordered the pho soup and spring rolls and they were amazing! Hands down best and only pho soup in summerlin!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. Convenient location and I was able to get seated and order within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I have been here many times.  They have awesome egg rolls & pho rib eye.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Would highly recommend the P-2 combo, Phô with all of the various meats in it. Great taste, perfect portion sizes!"}
{"text":"I was craving pho to get rid of my hangover. You can order a small or a large bowl of pho for $7.95 or $8.95. It's a build your own pho place where you can choose up to three meats. They have six meats to choose from: tai (rare steak), gan (tendon), sach (tripe), bo vien (meatball), chin (flank), and nam (brisket). You can get Pho Dac Biet with all six meats for $9.50 or Pho Ga (chicken pho) for $8.95. I'm boring so I went with a small bowl of Pho Tai. It was just the right amount. My broth was light, refreshing, citrusy, and not greasy.

I also ordered Cha Gio for $5.50. OMG! Excuse my French but these are the best PHOking fried egg rolls I've had in Vegas so far. I haven't been to many Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas but please let me know if you know of any better egg rolls than the ones they serve here. 

They also have a small bakery which I was too full to try. I didn't see many Chinese dishes. They serve mostly Vietnamese food. The decor of this restaurant is cute. It looks like an outdoor cafe with cute street signs such as Pho Blvd adorned with lots of plants & Asian style roofing.

Service was quick and friendly. The young waitress took my order, the food came out quickly, and in a reasonable time. She even checked up on me which is unheard of in most pho restaurants. However, it took a while to get my bill but they were busy so no worries. 

I will definitely be back for those delicious, fried egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's right in the neighborhood and the food is delicious! When you walk in you're automatically greeted with a smile. Fast and quick service!"}
{"text":"I just moved from California, so with that being said, I have to look for everything on Yelp. My husband and I were actually going to another pho place but it was closed. We ended up here, and let me tell you, Best Pho ever!!! We will be back soon. The customer service was really good as well. Thank you"}
{"text":"The place is clean and airy. The service is good... The pho is just average tho, the broth is not too flavorful... Had to use sriracha sauce and hoisin sauce to add flavor... The vegetable roll is really good. The beef is good.., The dessert flan is good tho... I would rather go to the other pho places in Chinatown. You can try it for yourself tho... It's just my take on it..."}
{"text":"Best Pho ever and delicious Jasmine Pearl tea too. Amazing service as well! We just stopped in after a massage and ended up loving our new favorite Pho place'"}
{"text":"They hold the cure for hangovers! I love this place. The phó is so fresh . It's just amazing . Customer service is really good . And they only sell authentic Vietnamese food ."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was \"AMAZING\" and the staff is very pleasant. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent broth. Cheap and fast. What else can you ask for. Owner is very proactive and very friendly. Will eat here any time on this side of town. There are many oho places here in Las Vegas. This is definitely a strong contender for one of the best."}
{"text":"My experience here was so bad, I would not come back. I didn't get pho, I ordered chicken fried rice and it was so dry. The chicken tasted like it's been sitting out and the pieces were huge and barely shredded. I asked for lemons THREE TIMES and I never got them. I asked the male waiter, then asked the young girl, then my friend asked the young girl for a side of \"lemons and limes.\" I made a joke and said, \"watch, she's only going to bring out the limes.\" That is exactly what happened. I'm not sure if they didn't have any or don't know what lemons are but they should have said that versus telling me they'd bring me some and never receiving them. Then while paying for the food, the male waiter hovered over me and I felt forced to tip even though the service was horrible. 

I would not come back here again; dry food and bad service."}
{"text":"A friend and i visited Sidestreet since we were craving Pho and wanted to try a new place. (She lives north side and I'm south and we wanted to meet in the middle) We brought her 2 year old son who was instantly the main attraction. Great service (made sure little one had everything he needed including a top for his drink) and yummy pho ga. We always like to order the crab rangoons and spring rolls which did not disappoint either. I would definitely recommend this venue if you are looking for fast service and yummy pho on the west side of Vegas."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place but it turns out their pho is excellent! This is also a wonderful place for VEGANS! It's is very hard to find a place that offers vegan pho that is actually good. Surprisingly the broth for their vegan pho is excellent!!! Hoisin sauce is already vegan so you don't need to ask for vegan hoisin sauce. You must order pho here if you are vegan you will not regret it! Now for the non vegan pho I will have to say it is also excellent! I am 1/2 veitnamese and grew up eating homemade veitnamese food. So believe me when I say this place is very good for pho! Aside from pho Thier fried rice with chicken sausage is good. Kind of greasy but taste great. Chinese sausage has a lot of fat in it so it's expected. The fish sauce for dipping is pretty good. There are several ways to make it. Some people make theirs sour, some make it sweet, some make it salty and then there is spicy. There is no right or wrong way to make fish sauce for dipping Because of the many variations. I prefer the sweet version. This place makes it somewhat sweet and spicy. It's pretty good. So definitely try this place!!"}
{"text":"Glad this place is literally across the street from me. Only complaint I have is that they close early. Would love for them to extend their hours possibly 1 or 12am."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It is always clean and the workers are always on top of it! When you are a regular here, they learn your name and know your order by heart. It's like walking into your families home, not a restaurant. Their veggie pho with beef broth is delicious! Food is always fresh and prepared perfectly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am new to Vegas and just wanted some good Pho. I had the Chicken Soup which was delicious. The Fried Chicken Wings was great also. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My god the pho here is good! Did double meat double noodle rare steak. Absolutely blown away.  Wife had chicken curry. The curry was off the hook! I ordered pork egg rolls And they were amazing as well. You have to be a little patient with some of the help because English isn't the first language but they were very polite and helpful. Def a new favorite pho spot!"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped in to grab a quick dinner. We grabbed an open table as we entered through the door and our food came very soon after our orders were taken. Our water cups were refilled as soon as they were empty. The pho was delicious! I very much prefer this place over pho kim long but comparable to pho delicious without the nem nuong."}
{"text":"Sidestreet has become my new favorite Vietnamese spot now. Today is my second time this week. Family friendly, super attentive servers that refill drinks without chasing them down. Food is very traditional. Doesn't taste like they came from a bag of MSG. Smiles on everyone's faces. They continue to check up on you. Just all around a nice environment to eat in. I haven't had a bad dish yet. Heck, I might just come back again this week!"}
{"text":"Super good.  We try a lot of Vietnamese restaurants and this one just took the top of the list!  The spring rolls were very fresh and crisp with excellent shrimp.  The peanut sauce was rich in flavor.  The Beef tendon, rare steak, and brisket was juicy and portions were generous.  Happy!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pho in town.  They also have the best service out of all the pho restaurants in town.  Everything here is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, no msg and service was ok. Everything was fresh. We will go back! Quick convenient and good prices"}
{"text":"Walked in and walked out! Not paying 10$+ for a bowl of pho!!  Stop ripping people off! Pho is 5-6.99$ in California!!"}
{"text":"Food was on point!!! Found my new fave Vietnamese  food with the best egg rolls ever!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for pho if you're in the vicinity. Their large bowl of noodles woild be considered medium in Westminster, California. However, their broth was good, brisket and rare beef were tender, and noodles were not over cooked. The basil that came with my pho was a little beat up / wilted. This place was clean, service was good, and I would definitely come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone to this place for a few years now. Definitely noticed that there is either new owners or new cooks. We've always ordered the same thing. Ribeye pho, wonton & bbq pork egg noodle soup & egg rolls. Several months ago I was pregnant and wanted pho. We ordered our usual and we both got sick. My husband has a pretty strong stomach & he was a lot sicker than I was. It's been a while now and we tried them again last week. I had food poisoning for 3 days. We'll never go back again. We like our health."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" place when we need a quick quality service & food!
Their Pho is always a winner! My personal favorite is brisket, flank & tendon Pho! Their young coconut is very refreshing & the meat is like a dessert!
Definitely a 5 stars for quality & value. Hope you can experience it yourself :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped by here for lunch today. We live close by and have passed it 100 times and on a whim chked it's reviews and saw the 4.5 so made a note to try it out.

4.5 stars hits the mark. We have tried about a dozen different pho places here in Vegas, this place doesn't disappoint. Pho is great, we both got the combo pho that has everything. Flank, rare eye round, tripe, tendon etc... Broth was great, lots of  rice noodles. Sprouts were fresh, basil was crisp, but only downside, and it's a biggie for me, the meat was way too thick, makes it dry and not flavorful. Other than that pho was great.

Had the beef Papaya salad, again, very good. Huge portion, fresh, jerky beef was nice. Would order again.

Had the crispy egg rolls, again, fantastic. Have their own taro, vermicelli, carrot combo, was great and unique.

SLICE THE BEEF THINNER AND YOU HAVE 5 STARS FROM THESE FOODIES."}
{"text":"Came in here because I was getting bubble tea next door, and figured I would Yelp the best Vietnamese food around.   What do you know, there was a highly rated place just 3 doors down in the same strip mall island.  I got a standard - pho with a combination of everything.  I also got an order of the fried spring rolls and papaya salad with pork and shrimp. 

Pho - outstanding, and I had takeout.  It was still piping hot when i got home (i guess that's to be expected in the desert).  The combination of meats and fresh vegetables really made this dish pop - they also throw in a cup of the black sauce and a packet of Sriracha. 
A bit on the oily side, but I'll eat this again for leftovers, it was a good portion.   

The fried spring rolls were good as well - moist and good flavor inside, and crispy on the outside.  The cloyingly sweet sauce was a bit much, however.  The papaya salad was good in the fact that it was cooked well - the shrimp and pork both very tender.   The flavor just wasn't there and although cooked well, was a bit bland. 

They worked magic with takeout pho, so I can give them a solid review.  Doubt I'll be back soon, but I would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for a Vietnamese fix in the area."}
{"text":"We were staying nearby this restaurant and saw the great reviews. It did not disappoint! The service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious. I had the papaya salad, which was fresh and the flavors well-balanced. My daughter and I shared a bowl of pho (they split the bowl for us) and my husband was able to get a vegetarian pho. Will definitely go back whenever we're in town!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I will drive out of my way to go here. The pho is amazing, they serve you and leave you be, but stay close by in case you need something. They are priced fairly and again.... the pho is AMAZING. Also, it doesn't smell bad like some other pho places I've been to. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"I love to go there order shrimp papaya salad with shrimp chips, and fried rice, vietnamese roll, french bread sandwitch is sooooo yummyyyyy. Pho noodle there is soooo great too,  I am addicted..."}
{"text":"The best phö in all of summerlin area without having to go all the way to Chinatown. I pride myself on Vietnamese food and know just off the broth if the phö will be good or not. First off I picked up my order. By the time I got home, about 15 min later, I didn't have to reheat my soup. It was still piping hot. Amazing. The broth is very good. I got a vegetarian phö. Just broth noodles and the accoutrements like bean sprouts and onions etc. Amazing. My new favorite phö place."}
{"text":"Excellent Bun Bo Hue.  The broth was amazing with a good amount of heat to it.  Location is in a strip mall that has plenty of parking.  Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I had the veggie pho no tofu with chicken broth, fried egg rolls, and hot tea. The fried egg rolls were ok but I'm not sure what was in the filling. I tasted a lot of carrot, which was not bad, just different. The pho was ok too. The staff was friendly which helped the experience. I would rather have mediocre food served by friendly staff than excellent food with poor service. I will definitely be back to try the banh mi and hope to be wowed by the pho next time."}
{"text":"Our town doesn't lack for good places to eat noodles.  Sidestreet is one of the places I'm starting to frequent when I need a quick Pho fix.  At the northeast corner of the intersection of Desert Inn and S Durango, it's easy to get to.  There's the main storefront / set of shops there, and several others grouped together in smaller buildings in the parking lot.  Sidestreet is one of those, so don't look past it.

The menu is big enough to satisfy you regardless of what kind of Pho you're after, and there's a generous assortment of other appetizers / assorted street foods on the menu to ensure you can supplement your soup.

If you don't already know what you'd like, I recommend trying the Pho Ga or Pho Tom.  Both are tasty.  Another way to go is to \"make your own\".  This was what I did the first time I went, and still do when nothing else on the menu seems to satisfy the craving.  From the appetizers, the Papaya Salad is very good, as are the fresh spring rolls with grilled pork.  I haven't tried any of the Udon or egg noodle soups yet, but I keep promising myself I'll do it soon.  I know I'll find some new favorites from those parts of the menu.

While it seems there are always people there eating at mealtime, I've never had to wait to be seated, making this a place you can go to for lunch during a busy day and not worry that you'll lose valuable time waiting for a table.  The restaurant is always clean and relatively quiet.  When you arrive, you'll notice the staff always seems happy and genuinely glad to see you, whether you're there to dine in or just to pick up an order to go.  Speaking of take-out, if you order soup to go, the cold/fresh items are packed separately from the hot broth so you can add them just before eating.  Just what you'd expect from a good Pho restaurant.

If you find yourself in the south-central part of the westside of town and you're hungry for Pho, swing into Sidestreet.  I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Have gotten carry out a few times and it is awesome!  You need a huge bowl to assemble everything they give you for a regular size bowl of pho!  More than one meal worth"}
{"text":"Second time coming here I love it. It's great hangover food and good authentic pho. I usually get the spring rolls and rare steak pho. It always makes me feel better"}
{"text":"The pho with rare steak flank and tripe is on point. Best pho this side of town. Great friendly staff as well.. good atmosphere fast and fresh.."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my parents and the service was terrible and I wasn't the biggest fan of the spring roles.  I guess once the service is bad everything just goes downhill.  Literally had to hunt people down to get the bill."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved it!! Had the rare steak pho and was bomb!!
Egg rolls on point.
I would come back to get my phone fix. Especially because they have different size bowls"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Located in a little mall area with plenty of parking.  I had the Pho (combination) and the Bun Tom Cha Gio Thit Nuong over rice noodles.  For the pho, that broth was wonderful!  Very tasty.  The other dish on the other hand, not so great.  Very bland.  However the meats were seasoned well... I just didn't feel the dish.

What really upset me though was that the cook was having a huge fight in the back during the middle of lunch hour.  You can hear him screaming and throwing things at someone... not sure if it was an employee or customer but it really put some edge on during lunch.

However, even with all that I give this place 4*s because it was that good.  Stick with the Pho!"}
{"text":"Stellar pho and pork sandwiches. That's all I've had so far, but im definitely going to be working my way through the menu! On top of the best pho broth I have found in the city, their decor is super cool and the staff is fantastic. Really nice to have such a stellar option in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"We were seated, order placed and hot food on our table quickly. Waiter gave us suggestions and the food was tasty. I am a vegetarian (who eats fish) so of course I had the vegetarian eggs rolls made with tofu and the shrimp Pho made the vegetable broth. The wait staff kept our glasses full and checked on us regularly. If you're in the mood for Pho, I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had the Bun Cha ( Vermicelli Noodles) with grilled pork, grilled prawns and an egg roll, it was top notch. This is basically a Vietnamese Restaurant specializing in Pho noodle dishes."}
{"text":"The food was great; I had the pork chop rice meal, my wife and our friend had pho dishes, and my picky daughter had fried rice.  The food was out to us quickly and our waiter checked up on us fairly often.  The atmosphere of the restaurant stood out the most.  It was relaxed and comfortable, pretty much from the employees to the customers, everyone gave good vibes.  There was also ample parking, which is rare for restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Had BBQ pork Bun and pan fried rice noodles with barbecued pork and bok choy. Also try the spring rolls with shrimp pork. Excellent!  Great  service place was totally full on a Sunday when many other local Asian restaurants are closed.  Oh, and they have the Raiders game on! Five stars just for that"}
{"text":"Of all the pho spot I've been to this is by far the best friendly and helpful staff. And another plus never crowded....if you looking for a nice quite date night or family night place this is it!"}
{"text":"Been to a fair share of Vietnamese restaurants here in Las Vegas. This place will always have my number one vote and support to the fullest. They straight up kill it here with everything that comes out of their kitchen. They stay consistently GREAT! Everything here is FRESH and not just thrown onto a bowl or plate just to get out of the way. Their food here is Delicious and authentic. Theirs too many pho places everywhere that it seems like it's all the same. NOT here, their pho is THE BEST in town! If your looking for something spicy than get their \" Bun Bo Hue\" , spicy lemongrass  soup. It's the best in town like I say over and over but I absolutely mean it. Order anything you want I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Service is great and friendly and not too much to where they bother you. Food always comes out in perfect time, they will NEVER leave you waiting!5 stars all around for great service, great fresh and authentic Vietnamese food, very clean and warm interior and consistency of always always serving great food. *Most important of all, the whole place is very clean! * Unlike your average Vietnamese restraunt.  Side street is NOT your average Vietnamese spot at all!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on Instagram and wanted to try their noodle soup with wonton.
I had a chance to stop by as I had business to attend to in south west area, so there I was.

This restaurant doesn't have ambiance or mood what so ever. Just table and chair, in some what Asian night market ish interior.

There are plenty of seating. I visited around 1pm and was seated immediately.

Menu is pretty standard, what you find in most Vietnamese restaurant here. Same goes for the price. It's not crazy expensive, rather cheap.

On to the wonton soup noodle. I ordered Mi Hoanh Thanh Xa Xiu. Served with in 5 or so minutes. 
It came with bean sprouts, pepper slices, and lime wedges on the side.
A lot of noodle, 3 wonton, bokchoi, broiled pork, in broth.

First, broth. It's nice but slightly sugary.

Second, noodle. It's my first time eating egg noodle at Vietnamese restaurant. I liked the thread thin noodle for its interesting texture. But they were tangled up in broth and was hard to pull apart.

Topping and garnish. Bok Choi is beautiful, and a good match for gentle flavor of the broth. Pork Xa Xiu was very lean, almost dry. Could've used little more fatty, personally. Bean sprouts was crisp and fresh.

Now, the wonton/noodle/broth ratio. It's way more noodle, not enough broth. That's why it's so difficult to pull noodle threads apart from noodle ball. 
I wanted more wonton, less noodle, more broth.



Overall, food was decent (based solely on what I had), customer service is non existent. I wouldn't say it's bad customers service. It's just bare minimum. 
I shall return to try their pho."}
{"text":"Amazing pho very clean and friendly staff. My family to go place when we want good pho. Owner very pleasant always checking to make sure everything is good."}
{"text":"Great service from the very beginning. The waiters and waitresses checked up on us in a reasonable manner. Very unlike your typical Asian pho joint. The broth for the pho was delicious. It was well seasoned; you don't taste the  \"too much MSG\" taste that's gives you the food coma, and no blobs of fat floating. The portion is reasonable and the quality is worth the price. The owner there is very nice. This place well exceeds my expectations for a Vietnamese-Chinese place. Give it a try like we did. You won't regret. A hidden gem in Summerlin. Now we don't have to drive all the way down Spring Mountain for Pho."}
{"text":"The staff is usually friendly and the dining area is always clean and they got a decent Thai tea and tv. Also the manager seems friendly always asks if everything is okay
But I have noticed the food quality has been getting worse from the last year, the broth is lacking flavor and also I had order P.2 with all sorts of meats but I'm use to having that meat thin and kinda shred it's easier to eat, I had big cold pieces felt like I could choke. also felt like my soup could of been hotter. But overall this place is better than most places in Vegas but no where near as good pho in California. 

Step up your pho game."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pho I've ever had. They are 100% worth the extra few bucks you spend per person. We ordered the pho with 3 different meats, vegetarian egg rolls, Thai tea, chicken nuggets, and the kids meal, yes they have kid meals, pho with meatballs. Outstanding. Ecerything tasted fresher than any Vietnamese or pho place I've been to in Cali and Vegas. The customer service is 10/10, they have a/c, quickly serve you, and you actually feel like they genuinely care about you. This is my new pho spot!"}
{"text":"I will say the shrimp/pork rice paper spring rolls are the bomb!!! Peanut sauce too!!!
No one town compares!!
Will be back for rolls.
Pho okay...tasted better."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients make the flavors pop. A wonderful place . Staff was attentive which complimented the food nicely."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite pho joint-really clean interior, friendly staff and not overly crowded like some of the spots in the heart of Chinatown. The interior really looks like a street because it has street signs and the Asian rooftops. Really cool! It's also clean and the place itself looks relatively new.

This place has some of the best pho broth in my opinion. I like that you can customize your pho with the meats that you want. Most places just have the pho choices made for you. Here you can choose your meats a la carte.

The noodle bowl is also really good (I had that this time). Everything tastes fresh and well-made. The veggies taste like they were plucked out the day of, green and clean.

Overall, I will be returning here for my pho cravings. I think the only knock on this place I have is I wish they were open late. I'm still searching for my 24/7 pho joint."}
{"text":"On a cold winter night nothing is better than a delicious bowl of Pho!
Well, maybe one thing is better, but I can't write about that here!! LOL

Walked in and we were seated promptly with a warm welcome.

Upon the waiters recommendation, we ordered the fried spring roll appetizer.
No surprises here, just a good simple spring roll. 

I had the Seafood Noodle soup. It was really tasty!!! Normally I am piling chili peppers, and spicy stuff in it to pop the flavor. I am glad I tasted it first, after adding a few bean sprouts, some shredded basil and a couple jalapeño slices it was PERFECT! Really perfect!

My friend had Chicken Noodle with rice noodles. He loved his too!
Over all it was a hit!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Their soup base is fabulous. 
According to my dad who got s rice plate, they give less meat than other places and their rice is undercooked. 
I ordered the small build your own pho where you can choose 3 meats and I got two steak and 1 meatball but I got the same amount on steak as choosing just 1 steak. Their meatballs also don't taste too great. Their steak is pretty good and they don't slice it paper thin which is a plus. At first glance their small pho seems a bit smaller than the rest of the small pho I've gotten at other places but it did fill me up so although appearance it's small it does have a significant amount of noodles. 

So my suggestion is don't order the rice plates; and for the pho don't order meatballs or just two meats. Order 3 different types!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! I have visited twice now and both times have been good experiences. There's always friendly people working and great pho! I recommend ordering a small pho with the brisket and meatball. So good!

The prices aren't bad either! Can't beat $8 for a big bowl of pho! My boyfriend and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of pho places, but what I love about here is that the broth isn't too salty! One of the best that I've had in a long time. The bbq pork wonton soup is the shizz! So good! The service is not at its best but usually expected because it gets so busy there. But overall: BEST PHO in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is theee Best PHO restaurant in Las Vegas!!! Fantastic and authentic Vietnamese dishes!! I also love all the appetizers and amazing Spring Rolls!! You have to try the chicken Pho with Veggies and the specialty Jasmine Tea!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes Chinatown is just too damn far, and Sidestreet is the solution! 

These guys deserve a shout out for how well they pack their to-go orders. It was packed so well that even when the bag tipped in my car, no damage was done! All of the accoutrements were very fresh, and they hook ya up with every last thing you could need. 

We had two orders of pho to go, and I sure got my money's worth in tendon, tripe, and rare steak. It was excellent with two big strips of tendon! 

Fried eggrolls here are just s'okay. They give you a pinch of pickled carrot with mint and lettuce, but the filling is kinda s'okay.

Guys that work here are bomb, and you feel like you are just saying hi to friends. Make sure you come here to eat when in need of pho, and wash it down with a great Thai tea while you're at it. See y'all on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food here is a bit over priced but it's pretty good. The only thing that concerns me is the customer service. When I call and place orders here it's always a hassle to substitute things I want then I never get a total so I know how much my food will cost. I find it strange that when I ask for the total I'm told \"I don't have the total right now\". I've never ordered anywhere and was unsure about the price. If the customer service was a little better this place could bring in better reviews."}
{"text":"Food has fab flavor, very clean and delicious! I was passing through town craving pho, decided to give it a try and very glad I did."}
{"text":"Best pho! The broth is incredible with a hint of ginger! They give you all the right toppings, perfect amount of noodles to meat. food comes so quickly too! We ALWAYS go here, no other place compares. The service is great and friendly too!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese/Pho restaurant on the west side of town. No need to drive to \"Chinatown\" to get excellent Pho. Broth is outstanding. Rich and flavorful. Staff was very friendly and professional. Very spacious and clean dinning experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly family run restaurant. Yummy and fast. The seasoning on the chicken was perfect, not too much, or too little. Best egg rolls I've had in years."}
{"text":"I came here over FIVE times here and it's GOOD! I always order the rice plates and the portion is GOOD and BIG! The service here is great and the server always comes to see if we need anything. The atmosphere here is clean. I recommend coming here because this place is one of the BEST VIETNAMESE RESTAURANTS IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few Pho places and this is one of my favorites. The food is great, its consistent, and the service is great. The Pho is very flavorful and there are some good choices for kinds of protein."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to have dinner here to only be disappointed.  Greeter sat us down.   Let us sit there for 10 minutes , no meun, no water.  Then the greeter sat other guests and they got menus and orders placed.  Truly a disappointment on service and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Love that there is a great pho place on my side of town! Friendly service and great pho!"}
{"text":"Coming from a town without a Pho place and then moving here in Vegas I'm just so glad I have a Pho place within reach. 

Love that you can choose 3 types of meat for your Pho and customize it for your liking. They also have tons of variety which can be overwhelming but I'm glad there are choices. 

It was also my first time trying a vermicelli bowl since I wasn't in the mood for soup and I surprisingly loved it. I wish it had more meat though but it was still very tasty. 

The place is clean and nice compared to other Pho places I've been it's quite modern. Would definitely go back here for my Pho fix."}
{"text":"My quest to discover heart-felt, heavenly pho and soul-stirring crispy egg rolls brings me to Sidestreet Pho & Grill for Vietnamese and Chinese food near the corner of W. Desert Inn and Durango in the Vons shopping center. My search for 5 star service and a 5 star pho-licious experience reached its bon appetite apex after consuming a carry out order of Pho-Rice Noodle Soup, plus Cha-Gio, (Crispy, Fried Egg Rolls), and while I waited, a Peteso, (French Pastry Puff) with a can of Tangerine Switch Sparkling Juice.  Yummy!

The 5 star service award goes to Ken, the owner. From enter to exit, Ken welcomed me into the grill as though I were family.  Even as a carry out customer, my ten minute wait felt timeless.  His suggestion to try the Peteso was a winner and introduced me to the french influence on vietnamese cuisine.  Ken kindly pointed out that the food here was as genuine and authentic as his childhood culinary routine helping his mother cook street food in Vietnam.  

\"Ain't nothing like a home cooked meal\", I thought to myself in anticipation of reaching my own kitchen to construct a big bowl of the grill's broth with the traditional add-ins.

Now for the 5 star pho-licious award.  Sidestreet Pho and Grill wins hands down. The perfectly spiced broth alone earns a certificate of merit, then add bean sprouts, lime juice, scallions, onion and jalapeño slices, cilantro, basil, rice noodles, and a choice of beef cuts.  The aroma, texture and freshness of the ingredients plus the generosity of garnishes and sides assured me that here at Sidestreet Pho and Grill, I have found what I've been searching for: a welcoming environment and authentic Vietnamese food derived from a deeply rooted family tradition. Let's not forget the crispy, egg rolls; four to an order, they were fried and seasoned better than imagined. Finishing this vietnamese staple and appetizer proved to me that the motto on the menu, \"Amazing Vietnamese Street Food\", is absolutely true to its word."}
{"text":"Pho was amazing, the atmosphere was nice, the staff was friendly, overall a good place"}
{"text":"By far the best curry chicken I've ever had! Humongous serving for a very fair price (~$12). Husband had the rare steak pho ... double meat and double noodle. He said he has a new fav pho place. We were checked on often and saw the A rating as the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Quality food, Great Staff, and a very nice owner (: 
He'll remember you even if you haven't came in for awhile. Fair prices, fair portions, Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a shopping center on Durango and Desert Inn. I visited this establishment during the evening on a weekday near closing time.

Atmosphere: Organized, lively
Even when the is place is almost closing, the place is still booming and patrons are still coming in.

Service: Quick and Slick, Nothing spectacular
Upon ordering, they did not ask me for what drink I wanted and automatically gave me a water. I don't really appreciate people assuming I just want to drink water, but I let that slide. My bowl of pho that I had ordered was delivered to me rather quickly upon ordering.

Food: Pretty good, but a little disappointing
I received my food pretty quickly, which was a bowl of pho with three different types of meats in it. I was also given a plate of vegetables (bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapenos). I was disappointed on how little noodles I actually received in my bowl. The meats that I ordered, however, were totally up to par. The broth was flavorful as well.

The bowl overall was worth the price of what I paid for, but the lack of noodles was the eventual downfall.

Overall: Worth a visit! MIGHT come back
Totally worth a try, I might try something else on the menu. The pho I had was nothing special, but still tasty. I felt like my experience was a little under-valued, but don't let that stop you from having some Viet food."}
{"text":"The pho was tasteless. I order the combination pho and meh. My wife order the seafood pho and they put only 3 shrimps literally. Just skip this place and go to Pho Kim Lo in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese, I do not usually like Pho places, as they are usually greasy or full of MSG. I can't say this about this place. I was very impressed with the flavor of the broth and the how lean it tasted. The service was way beyond what you would find in a typical Pho restaurant. They have very polite, attentive, and friendly staff! The owner himself checked up on us and waited on us. The ambience is also very nice, and the decorations simulate as if you were out on the streets in Vietnam. Definitely going to be a regular! The only negative thing I have to say is the noodles were not fully cooked and a bit on the hard side."}
{"text":"Food is aways good, service and servers not quite there. The servers need to be fluent in english. My order was wrong multiple times due to the language barrier. It was apparent that were treating their viet people with great service and speaking with them in their language. I have specific food allergies and was telling the server not to put specific items in the soup and he did not understand me. So when i came with my group, I just ended up not eating since the order was wrong and he wasn't trying to understand me. Sadly, i love their food when they got my order right because the one person who spoke a little english helped, but he was not there this time around. When i asked the server for someone who spoke good english, he just kept ignoring what i was saying and went to his coworkers to talk crap about us right in front of us. In conclusion, I am asian, and I understand the fact of most asian restaurants, they dont have many people who speak good english but even broken english is fine. I managed a korean restaurant and made sure all the servers spoke clear english since our target market was mainly American. Unfortunately, We will not be returning due to this last experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday after a long night of over drinking on the strip, let's just say me and my good friend were experiencing a serious hangover. 
The chicken pho couldn't have hit the spot better, it was absolutely delicious. Our waitress was so nice and attentive, you can tell she is truly a nice person. 
I can't wait to eat here again, i love Pho and this colder weather makes me want it more often than not."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the authentic way to eat pho but they serve it separately where you cook the beef in a separate hot pot before you put it in your pho. I had the ribeye beef pho with a Vietnamese iced coffee. It was the French press type that drips into the condensed milk. Super good!"}
{"text":"I am here now at this restaurant. I am eating vermicelli noodles with lemongrass pork.I love it. My dream  has come true. Finally a great Vietnamese resturant in Summerlin.Go there! Don't even think about it!"}
{"text":"The P1 is a banger, I get this at least 3-4 times a month. Everything is fresh and the soup is out of control good. I don't really care if the service is good or not, just so long they keep making that soup."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best local place to get good hearty Pho, I'm stuffed and still have meat left. the service is the best I've experienced. They have a wide variety of choices on their menu and their Thai Tea is amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The service is outstanding and the food is superb!!! The place is very clean! Finally a place where everything is made fresh and not frozen! 
The owner is amazing! Made us feel very welcomed! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Not only is this place clean, fast , friendly and attentive the food taste great too. Sometimes in Pho restaurants the food is good but the service is sub par and we have to suffer through the poor service and/or finding our own utensils. My family and myself def have found a new fave near our home! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had! Too bad I'm from out of town or else I would be a regular here. It was worth making the 10 minute trip from the strip to here for amazing pho. The interior of the restaurant was very clean compared to most pho places and the staff was super friendly. The pho itself was so good that words cannot even explain! It was by far the best pho I've eaten. Can't wait until my next trip to Vegas so I can come here again."}
{"text":"Great food! I got the chicken pho. Service was speedy and everyone was very friendly. Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Good Pho and very nice spring roll here. I really love soup here Coz the test is so good and they're serve very big place also food come so fast."}
{"text":"One of the worst pho and BBH I've ever had. Football blasting on the TVs, no Vietnamese music...never coming back, not recommended at all!"}
{"text":"Best bun bo hue in town! Nice cozy place and great food and great service! They also have the most awesome buns but you have to order few days in advance because it's that good and always runs out!"}
{"text":"Sidestreet is my new to go place for Vietnamese dining. The food is delicious, the staff were very friendly, and the establishment is very clean.

Different from other Vietnamese restaurants, Sidestreet has a \"build your own pho\" option. They allow you to choice 3 out of 6 types of meat that go into the pho, or for an extra dollar, you can have all of them. Not only is it delicious, but the portions are big and well proportioned. 

I had pho with flank, brisket, and rare steak and it was delicious. I couldn't of been happier. The egg rolls here are also delicious and are a great appetizer.

The staff are also very friendly! Often times, restaurants don't like when you share and don't always help. However, the manager not only gave me an extra bowl, but also a pair of scissors to help cut the noodles. He was so nice. 

The establishment is also very clean and organized.

I love this Sidestreet. I've recommended it to a lot of people and they have all had great experiences here."}
{"text":"Our waiter Jimmy was most helpful. Menu has a great variety to choose from. portions were generous. Never had papaya salad which was great.
BUN with lemongrass beef and eggrolls was delicious.will come back again when in town."}
{"text":"My favorite place love their pho and egg rolls and customer service is great.I had a problem with my delivery order and they fixed the problem the following day."}
{"text":"This place was great. The staff and owner were very helpful and helped my family (who hadn't tried Vietnamese food before) order and assembled the dishes. Great service and food. Would go back."}
{"text":"I like rib eye pho the most, it serve with mini hotpot so you can cook your beef, and keep having hot soup till the end :D
The soup is lighter than some other pho restaurant but I like it because I don't feel thirsty afterwards, I think they didn't put MSG in it.
The owner is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This isn't the best place for authentic Viet food, but the service is definitely A+. I also feel that their menu is much more expensive the others I have gone too. Still a good place to catch lunch ."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Plenty of parking in front, plenty of tables and the service is great! I ordered the special combo Pho, Shrimp and Pork Spring roll, and a Wonton Soup. The spring roll was a great size prob biggest serving I've had in Vegas (and I've gone to a lot of places) plus its $5.50!! The Pho was spectacular! I almost went to the kitchen and kissed the cook lol. Overall great experience, fast service very reasonable prices and now they serve beer so I guess I have a new favorite restaurant! Definite 5 stars!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of outstanding!!! The Pho is spot on. Very friendly efficient service. Great family run place the love of what they do shines through"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my parents today, cuz I was in the neighborhood. The food is okay, service is okay, and price is a little bit more expensive than I thought. Pho 88 near my house is definitely better IMO."}
{"text":"Ordered togo today of bun bo hue and bot chien trung. The broth for the bun bo hue was yummy! The bot chien trung was great too, but I was hoping the sauce could be more tangy with the usual vinegar taste made specifically for that dish. Otherwise, I enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"I was here with my girlfriend and her cousin on a Tuesday evening. It was actually quite busy with almost every table occupied. Anyways, we were seated and we ordered our usual vietnamese things: the spring rolls, 2 large pho tai to share, and bun cuon thit nuong (bbq pork with mint, lettuce wrapped in rice paper). 

The food: Absolutely amazing like they say on their shirts haha. This is probably by far the best pho I have ever had in las vegas. The temperature was super hot, the flavor was awesome (I didn't even add any hoisin sauce...just jalapeños and lime because I like my broth a little limey). The spring rolls tasted awesome as well and we finished those in a heartbeat haha. The bbq pork wrap was packed with so much flavor that I ended up eating all of it myself...seriously the food was on point!

The service: Despite it being rather busy, the waiter (todd) was super attentive and kept our drinks topped off. He even stopped to chat with us a few times, which I thought was really cool of him. I feel like at a lot of the other pho places in town, they just barely talk to you and just make you feel like a number. 

The atmosphere: I think the decoration of the place is actually pretty neat... They have these indoor \"rafters\" if you will, simulating a street like feel. There was also a large flat screen TV by the register that had basketball on which was cool.... so basically this place would be awesome to eat some pho and watch a game or something.

Overall I am super excited that a pho place like this has opened on my side of town.... it beats having to drive into china town (and avoiding the traffic). This place also serves amazing food!! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty top notch Vietnamese. Most meals are prices under $10 and many of the dishes are just $5 or $6 and good enough portion sizes for a full meal. The pho is solid and the appetizers are great. I will definitely be back for a sit down meal or take out."}
{"text":"We order this place pretty much every other week! Really friendly service (can't stress that enough) and the pho is great!"}
{"text":"Good Pho great proportion sizes also really good place to get your pho to go and they have a big screen TV and they put on the games got to like that"}
{"text":"We drive out of our way to come and eat here. We found this place and tried it one day based on online reviews. We were very impressed. The owner is there everyday. He walks around making contact with everyone and is the nicest man ever. One day I ate all the broth but not many of the noodles. He noticed and brought me extra broth to take home and use the noodles in later. I couldn't believe how incredibly thoughtful this was. It really put a smile on my face. 

Their PHO has great flavor and always comes out piping hot. Plenty of sides and toppings as well. We often order to go and they package everything up nicely and send you with plenty of toppings and ingredients. 

This is a place worth trying."}
{"text":"Service is  outstanding! (I felt like family) Food is delicious. I love the tâu Hù ky- tofu wrapped shrimp paste. I've only had this in California and was delighted to discover that they made this here! This is my new pho spot!"}
{"text":"This Pho place taste amazing! Being from L.A, I've had my fair share of Vietnamese cuisines and this is, hands down, one of my favorites. The place is so organized and clean. The staff is super friendly and the food portions and quality speaks for itself. Definitely a place to eat when you are looking for authentic Vietnamese food in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times now, and I have enjoyed the dishes that I have ordrred. The owner is very personable and the food comes out hot and fresh. Prices are also very reasonable. My husband loves the won ton soup but will try the pho since it's a specialty. I love the grilled pork on rice. We love the fact that we don't have to drive to Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Excellent food, down home cooking, just feel like go home to eat!!! Must try their spicy beef soup, beef stew soup, and of course the special Pho!!! It is my place for Vietnamese food now"}
{"text":"Great amount of food for the price we paid. Fresh quality  & great service. Will recommend & come back to this place."}
{"text":"I always eat here and always had great service and portion pay good money for pho 12$ today i wouldnt even pay 7$ for the serving they gave me sorry to say not sure if they are falling and barely giving any ingridients for the pho but i wont be coming back any time soon sorry i say dont come here for a while"}
{"text":"Loved there wanton soup, and tofu. Which usually I'm not fan, especially in huge chunks of but they have a good tofu here and I don't mind the big cuts. I also had their fried wonton and steak pho. Was good but wasn't a fan of the steak broth, strong clover taste. Wonton soup all the way!"}
{"text":"I love this local business! Most often, I order the vermicelli noodle bowl. I'm vegetarian, so I get it with vegetarian eggrolls and soy sauce dressing instead of fish sauce. I love how fresh the flavors are! Fresh cucumber, carrots, lettuce, basil, and chopped nuts are a great touch. 

The traditional pho broth is on-point. However, the vegan broth doesn't really taste like anything. A little disappointing. :( Also, for some reason the fried tofu is great in the pho, but super dry when I order it for the noodle bowl. 

The staff are great. There was a recent change in management, but no change in the quality of food. I've only ordered take-out, so I cannot speak to the dining experience there."}
{"text":"Thank you Ken for the great service!! The pho was great plus it's right down the street from my new place, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We always come here since it's close by, we usually get two phos and the fresh shrimp spring rolls. Consistent, and always fresh :)"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here  very well prepared. The staff is friendly, professional and attentive. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Our go-to pho place since it's the closest to us as we live in Summerlin and there are no good pho places within distance. We always order for pick up because the one time we tried to eat there, we waited quite awhile for someone to take our order. They might've had an off night but nothing wrong with having our pho in the comfort of our own home."}
{"text":"Sidestreet is located in the same plaza as Sen of Japan at the corner of Desert Inn and Durango. Unlike many, I'm not a big fan of pho. When I go out for Vietnamese it's more than likely I get a plate of broken rice or bún instead. 

Their grilled pork could have been more charred, but the deftly seasoned pig and crispy egg rolls made the bún cha gio thit neon ($8.95) a satisfying dish. A better dish was the Bún Cha Gio Ga Nuong ($8.95) -- tender slices of chicken breast glistening with oil atop a generous amount of noodles. The broken rice was decent, too. An order of grilled pork chop showed good depth of flavor and a good sear on the meat. A to-go order of it came with noodles and a separate container with the tiny grains of broken rice.

Much of the interior remains unchanged from the previous tenants (Oriental House), with wooden columns supporting a faux street scene roofline along the kitchen area and dining room. Fit for dining in or take out, Sidestreet offers up some decent Vietnamese for those not wanting to travel farther down Spring Mountain Road than they have to."}
{"text":"Just your basic GOOD Pho!! Quick. Friendly. Easy. Clean."}
{"text":"Not really a pho fan so I ordered B7 which was the grilled lemongrass chicken with egg roll and noodle. It was alright..."}
{"text":"Very quick service and delicious food. 

Chinese chicken sausage fried rice was a little dry but still delicious. 
Their Pho soups are very good and extremely filling. 
 
I placed an order for pick up and when I got home with it and opened up the contents I was very satisfied, they packed everything up very tidy like and organized. Nothing was leaking or being flattened and their portions were very generous. For the price it was a great buy.
Had the shrimp tofu pho and the beef something or other flank pho or something like that. Either way it was delicious!
Spring rolls with the peanut sauce were to die for! Yummy!
Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"My parents and I stopped here for lunch today. We had couple of hours wait until we return back to the DMV appointment.

 We ordered
# S1 Vietnamese Crepe stuffed with Shrimp and Pork
#P1 Make your own Pho - I chose flank, tendon and tripe.
#C5 Tofu skin shrimp paste, Shredded pork skon & Egg loaf.

The restaurant was quiet busy around 1pm. The place looked clean and laid back.

Apparently, I received a text from DMV & we had to leave due to my appointment coming up in an hour. I motioned for the waiter and had him packed everything to go. He was so cool about it.

When I got around to eating the food, they were all flavorful. The broth was so tasty. The portions are really big with generous amount of fresh ingredients. It's a great value here. You should try it & see for yourself whenever you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"ive been on a mission to find great pho and have been to 4 places in las vegas and this is the best so far.i went back last night to double check and it was great .the broth has what you want and the service was great as well ."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Right across from my favorite vet office.
Ordered combination pho (P2) with extra veggies.
The server brought me water but forgot to give me a straw. I asked for a straw. He made an obvious annoyed face and sighed. He brought me a straw like he was doing me the biggest favor. WTH!?
The veggies we very fresh and I really enjoyed it but when I put the tripe (see photo) in my mouth, I had to spit it out. It stunk so bad. It left bad taste in my mouth for two hours. Disgusting. I don't know if they gave me old tripe or what, but it was not edible.
I will not come back."}
{"text":"I love ordering the chicken rice noodle soup! You can make it as spicy as you want. I get the large so I always have leftovers :) Great food, excellent price and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  My wife and I love Vietnamese food and have tried a lot of different places here in LV. The ambience is open and very comfortable.  It's very clean and well decorated.  The food here tastes very fresh and is surprisingly less expensive than some of the other places we've been that were cramped and not so clean.  The service is very friendly and attentive. I love their grilled pork spring roll appetizer and the wife is hooked on the veggie egg rolls.  I usually get the pho and it never disappoints.  It always has HUGE chunks of tendon and generous portions of whatever other meats I order.  The wife loves the beef stew with egg noodles. I've had t a couple times as well to switch things up and it is really really good.  If you like Vietnamese food, you will love this place.  I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"The service... No good. 

Had the rice vermicelli with grilled prawns. We got extra prawns, which is 4. When the dish came, there were 8. Which means that without the extra, you get only 3-4. We asked the server about it and the response was \"The shrimp is very expensive\" ha! 

Also, prawns were not grilled. That is the Highlight of a vermicelli dish and it didn't happen. Came steamed and flavorless. Also, some still had the dreaded vein it them. Gross. The dish was also all noodle. There was a little bit of lettuce on the bottom, maybe a few bites and a few slices of cucumber. I ended up leaving almost half of my dish because it was literally just.. All... Noodle. 

The veggie egg rolls were very good but burnt. 

The potstickers are so gross and dry. They are deep fried, hard and absolutely not what I expected. 

There is no Chinese food here (as advertised on the signage). The server told us \"we do have Chinese food; we have fried rice\" and also that they were \"supposed to have it but the chef quit because he did not get along with the owner\".  Ah.. 

Overall, not happy with the food. I'm surprised because the ratings are pretty good and I was expecting the \"amazing Vietnamese street food\" as advertised. 

It is also very apparent that in this establishment, no one is really in charge, servers are very inexperienced, young and very open about the drama, which is a huge NO for customers and chefs are quitting before the place is even up an running. All bad news for me, enough to never want to come back."}
{"text":"Sidestreet Pho is a good compromise for pho without going into Chinatown. They do some things really well and others pretty good. I have both dined in and taken out and both times I was very happy with the service they provided. 
Their chicken pho and chicken vermicelli bowls are tasty, the fresh spring rolls leave something to be desired but satisfy a craving nonetheless. I have also had the chicken salad as well as the crispy noodles both were good and I would order them again. If you don't want to venture into Chinatown and deal with the tiny parking lots I would try out Sidestreet."}
{"text":"I love the pho here; very tasty broth, I could use more noodles for the amount of broth tho. Service is great, I don't even have to request anything . They made sure I have everything I needed; even drink re-fills, without me asking. Has an ok atmosphere, like most Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my husband. We liked it ...
Plus, its very close to our house, so we will definitely be coming back here.

We ordered spring rolls and Pho. 
- the spring rolls were so good and I love how they cut it half. It's great for sharing!
- the broth was very good. And the temperature was pretty hot. Soup should always be served scalding hot! That's my preference.
     -the meat was also tasty. Didn't taste old or had the \"frozen\" taste. 
-price was good. 

Service
- it was okay, it could have been better. They need to pay attention to their customers more closely.
    - check for refills
    - how the food is tasting or if there's anything else needed
    - taking empty dishes away

Overall..... 
We enjoyed it. We will have to try other dishes on their menu next time"}
{"text":"Hi reviewers.... who ever eat at this place and leave a good and delicious food ... I am so sorry they are either fake written or they are not Vietnamese, also don't know how to eat a Vietnamese food .

One star even is not deserved it ... nasty taste on Pho .. this is a basic traditional nation food that you can't mess up with it... but the soups base is tasteless no smell of the herb for Pho... the beef is nasty .... 

Overall please don't go to his place or... you may enjoy other food on their long menu .... but stay away from
Pho .... please ... otherwise you will regret it like me

And I am a good cook too...."}
{"text":"This place is Phoa real. We come here every other week and never get tired. Staff is very friendly and the place is always clean. Parking is also never an issue compared to Pho Kim Long lines to park your car."}
{"text":"Sidestreet Pho and Grill has been my go-to pho place for a year. Vietnamese cuisine has become popular in the area, and you can find a pho place everywhere. But Sidestreet Pho and Grill stands out because of few reasons. First is their food. I don't know how, but their broth tastes so much better than other pho joints in town. Their noodles are always cooked perfectly, and the side vegetables are fresh as well. I personally haven't tried anything else, but my friends say that other items are just as good as their pho. 
The interior is clean. It is certainly not the nicest atmosphere, but at least it's cleaner than most Vietnamese restaurants. They have incorporated the sidestreet theme by adding some street signs and roofs within the restaurant. They have plenty of tables to accommodate bigger parties.
The service is hit-or-miss. Maybe about 85% positive? Usually, they have servers who are extremely nice and friendly. The service is quick and they take care of the customers well. However, sometimes, they have rude servers who will not even respond to you even after seeing you asking for help... very rare though.
Sidestreet Pho and Grill is a great restaurant for your pho craving. It will be hard to find other Vietnamese restaurants that are much better this one."}
{"text":"I was too busy enjoying the Pho to take a Pho Tograph. This was my first visit here and it certainly won't be my last. I decided to start with a spring roll appetizer and upon the recommendation of my waiter the grilled pork spring roll was ordered. It was huge fresh and bursting with flavor. This could have been a meal in itself. However I ordered a small seafood Pho with rice noodles. The broth was complex with a depth of spicy flavor. 

The service was also exceptional, as I was attended to by multiple staff. The restaurant was clean, and bright, and although busy I didn't feel crowded. 

If you're a Pho lover, this place is Pho Nominal."}
{"text":"Thank you to the wonderful staff and service you find here at this tasty restaurant. Ken, the host made my husband and I very welcomed when introducing us to the Ribeye Hot Pot! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Come here if you want serious authentic Vietnamese food! It's really, really rare to find Viet food this good in vegas! The service is fast and friendly and consistent over the past few times I've been here. The wontons here are the best."}
{"text":"Always amazing service!! Everyone is so nice and welcoming. I've only gotten pho from here but it is delicious every time!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre pho place. It seems to be super popular with the yelp crowd but I can't say it's amazing or above average. 

Been here a few times and I usually stick to the combination pho. And I've tried their spring rolls - both pork and shrimp. And they're ok. Neither bad nor good. 

Would I recommend? Maybe if you're in the area. It isn't necessarily a hole in the wall but the service always seems so rushed and the tables always are a little dirty. Even after they've wiped them down. Maybe I'll have another go and see if I change my mind. Maybe not. I've really only gone here because it's convenient when I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everything I've tried is awesome.  Andy always knows my order as soon as I walk in. Service is excellent and food is even better.  Try the veggie pho and veggie egg rolls.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very clean, reasonably priced and the food was delicious!  My husband and I enjoyed our orders:  loved the flavor of our WONTON SOUP broth and the taste of the little crunchy pork that's added in there.  The CHICKEN SALAD was huge!  Didn't think I'd finish it, but I did.  My husband had grilled pork chops and he cleaned his plate! Service was great too.  Would I eat there again?  YES I WOULD!!!"}
{"text":"Have come here in the past for Vietnamese coffees and they are the bomb! Wanted to try some food this time around so we arrived for some early dinner at around 5pm before they got too busy.
When we walked in, there isn't a booth at the front or really anywhere to wait but we were acknowledged and seated pretty much straight away. The decor is pretty simple but around the edges of the restaurant they have little roofs and street signs named after Vietnamese food that honour the restaurant's name. 
We ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls to start and they came with an amazing peanut/ satay dip which went perfectly! The rolls themselves were tasty and unlike others I have had around the valley, they don't skimp on the meat. Yay!
As a light snack we also shared the Grilled Lemongrass beef rice noodle which was definitely a generous portion for the price. The flavours were very subtle so worth dousing it with the fish sauce they provide and it would have been nice if the dish was served hot and with better cuts of meat. I liked the charred, smokey hint to the meat, but there was quite a bit of fat that comes with it, which personally I don't like.
We also ordered a Thai tea that they forgot about. No apology or offer to discount it from the bill, however they did sort it for us straight away and we took it to go.
Just a heads up with the Thai tea: I'm a sweet tooth and like the sweeter made TT's so this one wasn't for me, way too leafy. My partner on the other hand preferred it because of the more leafy, tea-like taste, so depending on what you prefer, it could be your favourite or one to avoid!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place based on the other yelp reviews. What a mistake!!! I ordered the Vegetarian spring rolls dry as all hell. Got stuck in my throat good thing I had a cup of water next to me! Second stir fry fillet beef was raw. Wifey had to re stir fry it (see pic) and lastly thank god is the rib eye pho which was salty as hell had to add water.

Place is disorganized and seems a little dirty to me.

Definitely won't be coming back here. So many better pho places in this town."}
{"text":"When me and my wife arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a waiter with a big smile. He seated us and the first we noticed was how clean the restaurant was. The decor was simple but nice. For appetizers we ordered the spring rolls and chicken wings. They were amazing. The Pho was also amazing. They were huge portions. Overall it was a great eating experience. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Three visits in two weeks. Yeah, we're in love. The Seafood Pho and Ban Mi sandwiches are our favorites, but there is so much more to try!!!  Summerlin needed Sidestreet Pho and Grill. We need to come back soon."}
{"text":"The pho was really good. The decor and atmosphere was excellent. Service was very nice and grateful. I love the close proximity to the house"}
{"text":"This place was very delicious, I came in around 1:30 or so and it was packed but they quickly sat me. I got coffee and some combination beef pho and it was fantastic! There was a TON of soup in the bowl, the bean sprouts were squeaky clean, the broth was flavorful and I left very full. My only issue was the jalapeños were sliced a little large, I couldn't fit a whole slice in my mouth. Nonetheless I'll be back. I've been wanting to find a good Vietnamese restaurant near my home for a long time now, NO MORE COLD DELIVERY FOOD! YAY!"}
{"text":"Truly a great way to taste the food of another culture. You can tell right away how fresh all the ingredients are. A welcomed addition to my restaurant collection."}
{"text":"Very nice place greeted us as soon as we entered. Very clean nice and new inside and out. Food came quick it was fresh and hot and the spring rolls were awesome.. Service is great no complaints. For sure will come back"}
{"text":"Came in for Pho. Was rushed to order after sitting for 2 min looking at the menu. Asked for sliced pork for the Pho. Was told yes then No. Just left. Too much heavy lifting and they were very unfriendly."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with my GF yesterday.I had the bun thit nuong \"rice noodles with grilled meat\".She got the bun bo hue, both was very good ,service was also great. The place is new and very clean. We will definitely be back and tell all our friends and family."}
{"text":"Some of the best PHO I've found and the freshrolls I've had that were not made at home!!!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. We were passing through this side of town and yelped a spot for dinner and we were extremely please with this spot. I love the grilled chicken on the vermicelli noodles salad (I can't remember what's it's called but it fabulous). We'll definitely make the drive to eat pho here again!"}
{"text":"Great pho!  Highly recommend the Pho Rib Eye.  Fresh coconuts. Che Ba Mau.  
Def will come back. 
My favorite was Pho So 1, but since they changed ownership - i never went back.  but came across this place since it was so close to my house. 
 Wonderful pho."}
{"text":"I watched as this place was being renovated to become Sidestreet Pho and I was glad when they were open. I really like pho and I am glad to have a place closer to home rather than have to go to Chinatown.

I stopped in yesterday for the first time and I got two large pho for takeout.  One was beef meatball pho and the other was everything--rare steak, flank, meatball, tripe, brisket, and tendon.

The soups were packed in two containers both having the meatballs.  In other boxes, there was the other 5 meats for my combo and scallions, cilantro, and sliced onion.  In a separate bag was a large amount of bean sprouts, some sliced jalapeños, and spicy Thai basil.  There was another box that had the two spring rolls I ordered.

While waiting for my take out, the owner gave me a glass of iced tea to enjoy while I sat there.  I also took the time to walk around and take some photos.  It's a very pleasant restaurant.  Everyone was very nice.

The pho was very good.  The broth was good and the meats were good, too.  The thing I learned from take out is to reheat the soup when you get home and get it back to scalding hot and then divide the portions and add your vegetables.  That would more closely match the restaurant version.

I'll be going back to try some of their other Vietnamese food and I'll definitely be back for some pho!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night and it was not that busy so we got a table for three and food was ok.  We had a com Thit nuong and the meats was a little dry and it was ok.  The bun bo hue and goi cuons were ok.  I had better.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Remember I'm in Vegas and NOT in Cali so bare with me. We stopped by before leaving Vegas and saw that this place had great reviews. I tend to forget where I'm at and need to take that into consideration at times I'm out of my hoods.

Our Lunch Orders:
01.  Lemonade Soda - $3.00 - 4.5 Stars
- This was absolutely a MUST if you come here. So good, it's actually better than MOST restaurants I order in Cali. I loved it but didn't think it was worth $3.00 for a small glass.

02.  Crispy Egg Rolls (4 Rolls) - $6.50 - 3 Stars
- Definitely was crispy and the inside was decent. At least it wasn't chewy. Just okay IMO.

03.  Sidestreet Pan Fried Egg Noodles w/ Beef/Veggies - $10.95 - 3 Stars
- The egg noodles were crispy and there were plenty of veggies and beef. It was okay, kids liked it. The sauce wasn't salty or starchy like most places.

04.  Bo Luc Lac - $14.50 - 2 Stars
- Not good, beef was chewy and salty. Really wasn't like what we are used to tasting in Cali. It was decent but not for $14.50. At least for that price, the beef should be tender. 

05.  Bun Bo Nuong Xa (Lemongrass Beef) - $8.95 - 2.5 Stars
- Lemongrass Beef was DRY and bland, no flavors. The fish sauce was watery too. Didn't give enough veggies like this dish normally comes with. Perhaps in Vegas, ppl don't eat their veggies like we do in Cali. 

06.  Com Tam Bi Thit Nuong (Pork) - 2 Stars
- The Pork was dry and chewy, the Bi was chewy as well with hardly any meat.  We left this dish aside, couldn't finish it.

07.  Com Tam Bi Suon Nuong (Pork Chops) - 2 Stars
- The chop was DRY and chewy. My friend didn't finish it and only ate the steam egg. I clearly see a pattern here...CHEWY! 

08.  Bun Rieu - 2 Stars
- Well, this dish is definitely not the Bun Rieu we are used to in Cali. The Broth was so bland and flavorless. The tomatoes are normally cooked long enough where they are tender and juicy. These tomatoes were firm.  

LOCATION - A bit far from downtown, located in a shopping plaza.

CUSTOMER SERVICE - Super nice staff.

FOOD - NOT AUTHENTIC at all.  Decent for Vegas but probably wouldn't be rated great in Cali. The foods are decent so if you're super hungry for Viet food, this place will do.

VERDICT - We will probably not be coming back if in Vegas, it's a good option for the locals.  If I'm in the area, I might order the Lemonade Soda!"}
{"text":"I've waited in the airport for 8 hrs today on my way home from Mexico. I am beyond exhausted and want to sleep. First thought when I landed in Vegas? I want Sidestreet Pho!"}
{"text":"Umm where is the American \"Traditional\". Simply false advertisement.  Don't be fooled.  I would have given 1/2 star if possible.  I'm Vietnamese and this place does not remind me of home.  The owners can't even speak Vietnamese.  A chinese Thai owners should stick with their own food.  Save money and time Goto pho Kim long there is a reason why they are busy.  Authentic deliciousness.  This place should just serve on the street side"}
{"text":"Well rated on yelp...
-Broth from the pho was meh
-The spring roll was nice and plump, but I ordered pork skin thinking it would be the crispy variety. Instead it was the chewy shreded variety.
-Service was excellent
-Place was clean
-Not the best pho I've had. It was passable.
-Probably won't go back

Come here if you want: quick place to get okay pho, clean well-lit place, somewhere not too far if you're in the neighborhood. 
Do not come here if: you can make it to chinatown, are a pho snob like me, hate good service"}
{"text":"I think I found my new Pho spot! Their pho is so good. The soup was packed with flavor, the pho noodles were just right, and the best part....the vegetables were fresh!! Usually, pho restaurants are pretty dirty and the tables are sticky, but this place was clean! The service was great compared to many other pho places too. My water was always, always filled by the server without me hunting them down, and they brought out the food extremely fast. I love this place! I cannot wait to come back~"}
{"text":"Good Mì hãi v? gõi khô bò ! my favorite thing in this restaurant !!! Nice staff very friendly :)"}
{"text":"I been there 3 times but I'm not gonna go back this pho restaurant !! I found hair in my pho and inside are very dirty . I could not use restroom... super dirty 
Price is over priced compared to other pho restaurant"}
{"text":"It was nice to walk into a pho restaurant with a little atmosphere. It is nicely decorated and staffed with very friendly people. We had the shrimp and pork spring (salad) rolls. They were exactly what you expect to get when you order a salad roll. They were nicely filled with the usual ingredients: shrimp, pork, noodles, Thai basil, and greens. I had the rare steak pho, and it was good. Plenty of noodles, a nice broth base, and the usual condiments. The rare steak was served on the side and was a decent sized portion. My boyfriend had the B4 vermicelli bowl with pork and chicken. In came in a good sized bowl filled to the rim with nicely grilled meat. The meal was exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"SUPER impressed with their service! 

I called in for a take-out order just to save time. When I got there, they weren't done with my food but I didn't mind since I came about 10 minutes earlier than expected. But what impressed me was typically when I would order take-out at other restaurants and my food wasn't ready, I would just sit on the side and wait for it to be done. But with Sidestreet, not ONLY did they brought me water to drink while waiting, they also angled the TV towards my direction so I could watch it clearly while waiting. WOW!!!!!

The food was great and everything was reasonably priced! I've tried several items on their menu including:

Fresh Spring Roll with Grilled Pork: My first time ordering Spring Rolls that had grilled pork instead of shrimp!! To my surprise it's still very refreshing regardless of the grilled meat. I did opt out of the mint just so it's not too overwhelming

Wonton Soup: FYI this does NOT come with noodles but very tasty and filling nonetheless! It comes with several LARGE pieces of wonton so even without the noodles, you can easily consider this an entree. 

Lemongrass Chicken Rice Plate: So much bang for your buck! It also comes with shredded pork skin and an egg loaf

Grilled Chicken with Rice Noodle: basically like the rice plate except with noodles! 

Very satisfied! There's a reason they're usually if not always full!"}
{"text":"Super pleased with the very high quality of Pho here.  We have tried this place a number of times and the food and service is consistent.

The Pho tastes fresh with a developed flavor.  The staff is quick and detailed, and the owner is always a pleasure to see and speak with. 

For great Pho on the west side, check this place out.  You won't be disappointed!."}
{"text":"This is the best pho I've ever had. My family and I find ourselves ordering it multiple times a month and sometimes even multiple times a week! We love it to go as well as at the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the soup is made extremely quickly. I go to college out of state and when I'm away I crave the pho from here!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food! Everyone was pleasant and helpful, and the pho was delicious! Will def be back many times!"}
{"text":"Ate there two days in a row !
Will never go back though. 
Why ? I'm from NJ and have no reason to go back to Las Vegas - but if I did, I'd be eatin here again !"}
{"text":"Amazing grilled wings and broken rice pork chop. We will definitely be going back. Service was on point too!"}
{"text":"In Summerlin side i only go this place. Servers are very kind, food is really good. Especially the broth is really good. They are cheap and good."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to come here for a long time.  We got the pho tai, wings, and fried egg rolls.  It was all very good.  The broth was very nice with a hint of sweetness.  We will definitely be back.  It was very clean and busy for being 3pm."}
{"text":"Review on take out: called and placed order for take out, told me about 10 minutes which it what it takes me to get there.  As soon as I got to the restaurant, my food was ready!  Ordered 2 vermicelli bowls one with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and egg roll and the other with grilled beef, grilled shrimp and egg roll.  Total came out to about $23.  When we brought the food home we were surprised of size of the portions, they were huge!  They included the sauce on the side along with a side of chili sauce too.  Both dishes were filling, delicious and refreshing.  The only thing I should've asked for was extra sauce on the side since I since I usually like a lot of sauce/dressing.  Will definitely come back, the workers were all very nice, food is good and portions are hearty.  Will return for either take out and/or dine in!"}
{"text":"Was avoiding the busy Chinatown, but wanted vietnamese food so we found this place on yelp. We should have just driven to Chinatown. The vermicelli bowl with grilled shrimp, pork, and eggrolls . While it was decent, there was very little meat. 3 pieces of shrimp was fine, but the pork was cut so small and there were very few. Also the eggrolls were weird and wet on the inside?? Attempted to take it apart and it looked like some kind of noddle or rice? Not sure, but it wasn't your regular eggroll. Service was ho hum and less than  enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Had Vermicelli tonight, I loved it. 

I think there were more ingredients then other places it was absolutely huge.  I am bring to find my new Pho spot this is a 3 time now so I think they have won me over.

Yay my new Pho spot! :D"}
{"text":"It's solid. Even the small portion is ample. The broth is hot and the side condiments are fresh. I'd go back. It's a flavorful pho. I ordered the combination and it was satisfying."}
{"text":"This place was great. My friend recommended I try Pho for the first time ever so I decided to give it a go. We ordered two large soups and mine came with Brisket and Spicy meatball. Huge portions. We were lucky when we came in when we did because half way through our meal the place was packed. Which is awesome for the business but a bit frustrating as a customer because people were standing waiting all around our table and behind us."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! Love the pho and the BBQ pork and shrimp vermicelli noodles! The egg rolls with lettuce and sauce is great. Check this place out if you live in Las Vegas, or are visiting from out of town. The owners are really nice people and answer any of your questions kindly if it is your first time trying Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"First time and what a great experience. Staff was very quick to get our orders and get our food. Did enjoy the Pho steak and the rice. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I may have found my new favorite pho place. I didn't even know about this place until I Yelped pho. Since then I've been a believer of Sidestreet Grill. I've ordered take out and dined in. 

The large portion is exactly that. Large. For the amount you pay and the portion you get it is well worth it. The amount of meat is also a good portion. I feel like other places have been skimping out and this place does NOT! I order my normal pho tai and the broth is fairly tasty. I did put an extra order in the fridge over night and there was a big chunk of fat but that's to be expected with the bone marrow etc. They also do a good job of packing and separating items to go. 

Dining in was easy and of course we went before the noon o clock lunch rush so that helped as well. The lady provided scissors to cut my daughters noodles (super helpful instead of using a knife and fork to cut) and service was fairly quick. They use an iPad for customers to pay via credit card as well. Overall, I'll drive the extra 10 min to get pho from here and since cold weather is a coming I'll be back for more pho!"}
{"text":"Happy to have stumbled upon this pho spot! And it's closer to me then other pho spots in china town. Service is fast & friendly."}
{"text":"Had a craving for noodles and Sidestreet Pho and Grill being right around the corner was a no brainer. Had the Combo Pho and it really hit the spot. Service was friendly and prompt. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is no where near China Town so there is not a cluster fu** of traffic to get there. The place is clean and smells clean and the pho is super yummy . 

They are very nice and take your order quick and food come quick . Seating is nice and great ambience . 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good.  Prices are reasonable, and always packed. Friendly owner and servers.  My new place for Pho!!!"}
{"text":"New pho place close to my place? Awesome.     
Their pho is good but the guy who took our order gets confused. He switched  my daughter's and my order. He also forgot to give us our plate of bean sprouts/ basil/ lime. 
We ordered the pastry puff as well but he didn't tell us until we inquired about this  later & that they were out of it. 
The food is very good though. Service is fast. Place is very clean. You could customize your pho with your own choice of meats. They also have Vietnamese coffee served with the French press - a 'must try'
Worth going back to."}
{"text":"I ordered to go from this place Friday night. So far so good. I ordered the Brisket Pho and it hit the spot. Everything was packaged well. All the fixings were neatly organized and packaged. I would try this place again but in person :]"}
{"text":"I have been in the restaurant for many time and the worker in here name Tom was an amazing guy with a great service. Give him a thumb up . I totally love the way he acted with a pair of Jordan . Look so cool man;) come and support the restaurant only because him$$$$"}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp pho and the soup was pretty tasty. Good amount of shrimp. Also ordered the bahn mi with pork loaf and fried egg, would have preferred grilled pork with the egg but it was good. Great service and good spot to eat lunch. We enjoyed it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really good for a quick pho fix. Very quick and attentative service. Right down the street from my house. Great food"}
{"text":"The pho here is super tasty and the staff is really friendly! I definitely recommend checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"I discovered this nice Vietnamese restaurant on the west side of town. The ambiance was nice and casual and the food was delicious! I have eaten Vietnamese food at other restaurants in Vegas, but this one will be my favorite. We will come again and recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Number 1 place for Pho!! I just wish they could serve beer and wine lol!
Great staff, nice size portions 
I'm obsessed!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be my goto place but not anymore.  Went to use the restroom and they took away my half eaten food and completely full drink.  I sit at the empty table awkwardly and have a bill shoved in my face.  How rude!  Seems like it service went downhill, gone for a few mins and food goes straight to the trash.  What a waste!

My 5 stars went to 1 quickly"}
{"text":"I am from Nor Cal. Which means of course that living in Vegas I'm constantly on a fruitless hunt for good pho. THIS PLACE RIVALS SF AND THE VALLEY! SO GOOD! AND AMAZING SERVICE...which is rare in an Asian restaurant. It's  very Authentic in tase!"}
{"text":"First glance, it's a quaint little place in the center of the busy city that never sleeps. The atmosphere is very traditional but is mixed with modern elements. The owners are very nice, but their accents are pretty thick. The service was great; highly attentive to the tables. Our food was prepared within 5 minutes looked delicious-it tasted even better. It was so good, we ordered more food to go!"}
{"text":"Came here to try Vietnamese food because it looked good. My friend and I ordered the pho dac Biet small bowl with spring rolls. The spring rolls was fine but the pho lacked flavor. It was average taste. I think next time if I come here I would try the rice dishes cause it looked better than the noodles here. I don't think their specialty here would be noodle dishes. The inside was clean and nice though. I just think the pho was average."}
{"text":"Average pho... But +1 star for the nicest group of servers/manager/owner(?)!

We were craving pho for that hot savory soup on a chilly night. No pho restaurants were open till late except this one said \"closes in 32 minutes\"!!! 
So I called them in advance to make order, but they said we can just come in and they will have our table ready. As we sat and ordered, they were starting to clean up and close. But they continued to check up on us and made us feel comfortable!
We were obviously their last customers and they probably took off 30+ min after their original closing time. 

Other than such friendly service, the taste was average. We all ordered Make Your Own Pho, which gives you 6 different types of meat to choose from. I believe you can choose up to 3(?). I ordered a small... BIG MISTAKE! Portions were actually really small haha I regretted not ordering a large ): 

The restaurant is spacious and clean. Definitely satisfied my appetite but really should have ordered a large! Expect A+ service :)"}
{"text":"Craving Vietnamese food but not willing to drive to Chinatown to our favorite place. So we went to a back up Vietnamese joint near home.

Ordered the kids chicken fried rice which was enough to feed two kids. A+ from me on portion, but my kids didn't like. It could be the chicken vs Chinese sausage pork fried rice. 
*Maybe have that as a kid option as well.

Ordered the kids pho with meatballs and that was perfect.

I ordered the Bun Rieu, soup flavor was delicious.  Although, the protein had real shrimps instead of crab and shrimp clusters, this was odd to me since I'm used to having it with ground up crab and shrimp and none of that was there. Plenty of tofus and tomatoes if that is what you're into. As for me, I would not order this again.

My daughter ordered the Pho Dac Biet, which is always a favorite and never disappoint.

I'll stick to my usual of Bun Thit Noung or Pho Tai next time and avoid the Bun Rieu.  As for the fried rice just order the regular Chinese sausage fried rice and take the rest as leftovers."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Good service. Easy parking. Boba next door. Happy to have a descent Vietnamese restaurant near Summerlin."}
{"text":"I'm convinced this is the best non-pho Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. I probably eat here at least once a week if not more. Why so much so biased? Because of the scale of value, taste and satiate is nearly perfect. I have co-workers who orders or eat here like it's Shabbat minus the pork/kosher element. I have not been disappointed with any of the items on minus except their Pho Dac Biet. You may think that's a major knock, but it's not when you consider their Pho Rib Eye. This dish comes ready to cook in a separate fondue pot and it's probably the best value dish of the entire menu. Ok enough writing about it, time to eat it!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends to try out new pho restaurant in the area. Inside was really nice, I was surprised how it looked. 

Service was okay which I didn't really understand since it was a bit slow with customers. The waiter that was helping my table was nice but didn't really check up on us. 

Food was good from what I have ordered. You get to make your own pho, kudos to that. Spring rolls and fried rolls were on point which is good. Their vermicelli is also good, wish there was more meat/food items that went with it. 

Overall I would recommend this place to others, only reason for my stars was service."}
{"text":"This place was very good.  Unfortunately went a little before closing and they had run out of numerous dishes.  However, I would go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the 1st time afternoon to try Sidestreet Pho & Grill. Let me start by saying this place was Phenomenal! None the least the service was A-1 and will continue to come back as a regular for more Of there Delicious Pho. I highly recommend if you are in the Area of Spring Valley/Summerlin. Thank you for the great service and quality of food."}
{"text":"BEST place in Vegas to get pho - hands down! My go-to meal here is the shrimp pho. After eating shrimp pho at Sidestreet Pho & Grill, all other pho places disappoint and they disappoint greatly. The broth at Sidestreet is always hot and flavorful. The shrimp is very tasty and never frozen (unlike some other establishments). The vegetables are always fresh and clean. Besides the great pho, their appetizers are also very delicious. I would recommend the Sidestreet Pho Chicken Wings.  

The service is fast and friendly, and the manager Ken is very professional. The restaurant is clean, and I really believe that no other pho restaurants in the Chinatown area can compare!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho. The staff was super friendly; our waiter gave me a box of their shrimp chips, since I liked so much.

There is plenty of tables available. Accessible parking and the restaurant is very clean.
I'm so glad to have found this spot. The food was outstanding and I'll be returning tot his restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here originally wanting to get some Pho but I wanted to try something different for a change! I ordered their Vermicelli Bowl (B12) which had egg rolls, peanuts, noodles, pork, carrots, green onions and shrimp. I liked it because it had some of my favorite things all in one . Egg Rolls, Shrimp and pork! It was around $10.95 it was filling but I think they need to serve it with a side of spicy sauce to give the plate more flavor. I thought it was worth getting and I was happy with my choice. I remember some guy passing by saying that it looked good but my mouth was so full of food all I could do is smile and nod. 

I also had some spring rolls to start with a side of peanut sauce because that is another one of my favorite things to order. I had a friend with me who has never has Vietnamese food so she stayed with a safe choice for her and ordered the Won Ton soup ($6.95). I thought she would have been better off with the Pho since that is what they specialize in. The Won Ton soup was not my favorite . The prices are decent and the portions are generous! It's a cozy place and the customer service is welcoming!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, my kids and I been there several times and the soup and vermicelli noodles was great.. I recommend it to those that likes noodles and grill foods."}
{"text":"Food was really good I get annoyed waiting at pho kim long then I found this place close to my house its very good the staff is nice too."}
{"text":"Good food, vegan friendly, consistent, staff is ok not very friendly the last few times we've gone"}
{"text":"Great to have a Viet place that actually tastes good and close to home. Viet Bistro is much closer but disappointing. We were warnly greeted by one of the owners, Ken, who promptly took our drink order and made recomendations. Ice Tea (no sugar) and hot tea are on the house.

For the appetizer, we shared the Shredded Pork with Skin Spring Rolls.  I had the small combo pho ($8,50). Broth was very falvorful and natural (no MSG that I could detect). I did tell Ken that our other favorite Viet place, Pho Saigon 8, small portion had a little more noodles which would probably cost them less than a quarter, but will increase the \"perceived value.\" Wife had the Pork Chop with Egg Loaf and Rice. Beautifully presented and tasty. Our friend ordered a spicy thick noodle with broth and I forget the name. 

Definitely will go back and support the place!"}
{"text":"it was ok.....i went there a few days ago, and frankly nothing stuck out about my pho. Ill eat here again, because:

a) I love Pho
b) its getting cooler outside
c) the location is convenient

But, I wish I could write more about them. Needs some flair."}
{"text":"I came here once for take out to get the noodles with the egg rolls and vegetables, kinda like a salad (I forgot what it was called) but it was SOOOO good that I figured I'd come back to try their pho. 

Their service was really good. My water cup was never empty and my food came out quick. And they were also very friendly. I've only been to a few Vietnamese restaurants where the employees were actually polite, and this place happens to be one of them. 

Their pho, I got the combination pho, it's $10.50 for a large I believe. And it's worth it. They're not stingy AT ALL with their meat. And their broth was delicious :)

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. When we ordered we let the waiter know we were in a hurry and had about 40 minutes. Our food came out fast and hot. The whole Waite staff was attentive to us. My husband was watching the basketball game on the screen and the guy behind the wet bar turned the TV so that he had a better view without us saying anything.  I highly recommend going to eat here. The food was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"I think I might have just found my new favorite pho place! My boo and I came here on a Thursday night to fulfill our pho craving. We were seated immediately and the place smelled amazing. 

When it came down to it I went with the chicken pho which was AMAZING! The broth was super flavorful even before adding in all the fixings. There was also plenty of noodles and chicken involved, definitely not skimping on any ingredients. The small size was more than enough for me and super reasonably priced. 

So glad I found this place and that it's located so close to home! A pho-king great find!"}
{"text":"I don know how they got the almost 5* but when I went to eat the pho tasted off. (Like the broth was old). Is nice inside and all but the pho did not impress me."}
{"text":"Very average pho place but there's not much choice if you don't want to drive all the way to Chinatown. I should add that I'm from SoCal/SGV so I've had my share of great pho. The first time I came here the soup tasted extremely weird and I had to squeeze in lots of lime juices to mask the weirdness. I can't really describe it because it didn't even taste like pho. Came here a second time because we wanted to give it another chance and we really wanted to like this place because it's the closest pho we can get. The pho tasted normal this time but I found a piece of hair in my soup. I didn't even bother telling them anymore since if the hair was in the communal soup to begin with it wouldn't make a difference if they gave us a new soup. Also both times their meat slices had that rainbow appearance and old oily taste. The waitress we had both times wasn't very nice either. I have RBF myself so I'm usually very sympathetic but she was really impatient even though we didn't take long to order or do anything really. Lesson learned and will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! The staff was amazing and very quick. Our food was wonderful and we had enough leftovers for an entire extra meal. This was our first time eating Pho and the waiter kindly walked us through our options and explained how to cook our meat in the spectate cooker. I was so pleased with the overall meal and service that I have already begun to recommend this place to my friends! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"There's usually so many Pho Joints in Las Vegas especially on Spring Mnt Rd that it's hard to decide where to go. Unlike some other bigger known names, Side Street to me, is like a place for Locals. & a delicious place it is. Authentic food, clean environment & sociable staff! What else do you want?!

Instead of reading reviews, I recommend you come & try the place out. But take everything with a grain of salt. Everyone got different tastes & opinions. The best way is to come here & experience for your self!"}
{"text":"Solid but unremarkable.  Eaten here twice.  Everyone is friendly, with pretty fast service, and clean atmosphere.  Portion sizes are just right.  But the food taste is a bit lacking, a bit plain.  But definitely not bad.  Pho broth is on the lighter side, with zero oil, meat with zero fat, if you like it that way.  Chinatown is out of the way for me, so I will probably be here again, but there are other places in town that are more memorable."}
{"text":"Living close to Chinatown, I don't usually go outside that area for Asian cuisine but this restaurant is a neighborhood favorite. 
The food is good and the staff excellent. Try their fried noodles; they are delicious.
There are a few Vietnamese places I like better but the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This is my new pho spot especially for vegan pho!! They have vegetable broth or beef broth and really good fresh vegetable spring rolls - the service is good and everyone is friendly- it's small but perfect and it doesn't make your clothes smell afterwards which always happens when we go to pho Kim long...the vegetable broth in the veggie pho is very lite and plain so throw some hoisin, chili paste, bean sprouts, lime, and you're set!! You'll thank me later!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for the first time and I am so glad we did!!! The restaurant is a cute smaller place with great service. The owner was really nice and friendly. I ordered the rib eye pho and I LOVED that they bring out the meat with a small cooker for you to cook the meat separately from the noodles. I wish every place would do this! We also ordered the egg rolls and they were also delish. Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and amazing customer service.  Love this place.  You can bring your own wine since they do not serve alcohol however you will need to bring a receipt.  They will provide an ice bucket.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"We picked up a variety of vegan options: pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, fried rice and vermicelli. Everything was OUTSTANDING!!! We will definitely be back...most highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The pho here is very tasty, not too fatty or oily and super fresh tasting. The place is always clean and staff is friendly. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas for Pho."}
{"text":"Soup is HOT and yummy! Services is super! Restaurant is clean and bright! We found our old server from other place! We have found our favorite pho again!!! It is not far from home! Just 5 minutes from home! Highly recommended to try this pho restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's our go to Pho place without going to anything near Chinatown. The place is clean and plenty of parking. The service is usually pretty decent when you get one of the younger servers who know how to smile and be polite rather than the older ones who are efficient but not necessarily polite. 'Thank you' and 'you're welcome' with a smile isn't going to kill you. 
Cons: 
It would be nice if they cleaned the vein out of the shrimp.
Not sure why the meat egg rolls taste a little sour.
Shrimp Spring Rolls sometimes have hardened which means they were made too far in advance.
Pros: 
Not having flies like Pho So 1 is definitely a plus.
Clean.
Close to my house
Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened. Service was great. Pho was delicious. Very flavorful. You didnt really need to add any condiments. 

The beef stew was also delicious.  Will be coming back to try more foods on the menu !"}
{"text":"We stopped in for some pho and it was delicious, the broth was amazing, good portions of meat as well.  The restaurant is run by a very pleasant family (Ken the owner is great). Kens wife makes the best flan I have ever had - texture was light and creamy and the taste was out of this world. Definitely recommend the rare steak pho and warm tea. Overall a very nice experience! Will be coming back for round 2 very soon!"}
{"text":"In keeping true to my vegetarian diet, I called Sidestreet Pho and made sure that their Veggie Pho was served with veggie broth. I was told that it was so I headed on in at lunchtime. 

When arriving we waited by the door and we were quickly seated. 

I ordered what I came for, Veggie Pho with veggie broth.

When the Pho came out It felt underwhelming. I did order a small but this seemed like so much less than you would get at any other pho restaurant. 

Time to dig in...  the pho noodles seemed starchy and bland. The broth was a tiny bit salty but otherwise flavorless. There were a few pieces of fresh veggies. 

I know that Veggie Pho can be challenging with regards to taste but I have had it prepared so much better at other places. 

Lastly, service waaayyyy fell off towards the end. All of our drinks went dry. We attempted to flag someone down for our check and we were abruptly told to pay at the cashier."}
{"text":"A basic pho place...very well prepared...attentive staff...food was rich with flavor...kept checking on my table...3rd trip"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, we knew his place was legit. The smell and service reeked of traditional authentic pho. Loved the H7! If you are looking for Asian comfort food, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Pho a good time, you may want to drop by here (I know I know. Please put the tomatoes away). We decided not to drive all the way to Chinatown for pho and stopped by here. It wasn't my first choice or my second choice. I wanted to try another new one (to us) around the same general area, but it closed at 9, so we aimed the old VW and came here since they close at 10.

It's a modern looking design with street signs inside. No doubt to help those too drunkard from strong Vietnamese coffee from forgetting their table?

So the neat thing here is that you can build your own pho and choose your meats: flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, round steak. You choose 3. I like my meat rare so I ordered it on the side. Just make sure your soup is boiling hot (that darn Pho #1 used to be consistently hot and I can order beef on the side but now it's safer to just order it in the soup so it's still cooked and not raw).

The tendon was cooked till tender and the round steak was nicely cut, as in no sinews but a nice piece of tender meat. I didn't have fatty meat that you have at Pho So #1 now. They used to be lean meats but I think they thought we wouldn't be able to tell the yellow fat clinging to the beef and the fatty oil floating on their soup now. As this restaurant and No 8 proves, yes it can be lean, Mr. Pho So #1 (#2 more like it).

The broth here is pretty good but not as flavorful as it could be. I added Siracha for more flavor. I usually leave it out of the soup if it tastes good enough. BUT, to be fair, I didn't feel the need to drink my glass of water. Usually at their pho restaurants, the msg is heavy enough to make you drink like a camel (and pee like a horse). A hour later I am still not that thirsty.

Overall very friendly staff and the place is very clean (again Mr Pho So #1, your floors don't need to be sticky and neither do the tables. I can't believe I've been eating there since the late 90s). So if you don't want to drive all the way to Ctown, (phogeddaboutit? Uh oh, I've officially tried to steal it from mob movies and the dude advertising for San Gennaro Festival. He and De Niro gonna be mad. My next Yelp review may be written wearing cement shoes.) this is a nice alternative. Oh yes, you can choose a large for $9.50 (?75) or a smaller one for a buck less I think. At least they don't default to large like #8."}
{"text":"Definitely got food poisoning from this pho. It was tasty but I'm suffering today. Had the veggie pho, spring rolls and Chinese sausage fried rice. My roommate has had it coming out of both ends as well so we know that's what it was."}
{"text":"Their beef stew is bomb. Love the pho. Service is great. Yes, actually friendly and attentive service!! I come here at least three times a week. I've tried pretty much everything here and have always been pleased with the food. Nothing else to really say besides try it and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to sidestreet for the first time today. Very clean and the service was great and fast. Had the combination pho with brisket and steak. I am a long time pho kim long lover so I compare all pho to them. Sidestreet was good but not very much meat or noodle and the brisket was too gamey for me. Maybe I will come back and try just the steak pho or one of the pork chops entrees. I'm still giving pho kim long my vote for best pho in Vegas but for Summerlin this place is The Best especially compared to view bistro and pho rose. The service and speed still makes it a 4 star experience though."}
{"text":"I ordered using postmates,i got the lemon grass pork, pot stickers, chicken curry (that we didn't receive ) and the vegetable pho  which whom I shared with my daughter. The forgotten curry isnt a big deal, things like that happen and i HATE to complain. But the next issue we had with this place is a different story.... I was almost done with my pho, had one piece of bok choy left. As I was about to take bite I noticed something floating in my soup.... it was a bug!  I immediately called the restaurant. The gentleman who answered the phone was somewhat polite,
but what really upset me was that he said that this is their first complaint ever about  a Togo order, which I find hard to believe.  He was almost making it seem like I was lying about it. All he said was that he will let to chef know. He sounded very unapologetic  and that was the end of the conversation. I'm not looking to get compensated but it wouldn't hurt for them to offer. Anyhow this was our first time ordering from here and probably will be the last."}
{"text":"Their Rib Eye is GODLY. The meat tastes like that they slaughtered the cow 3 mins ago outside, fresh and godly, unbelievable"}
{"text":"Finally a good pho spot on the west side.  I don't usually crave pho but this place is convenient to go to instead of having to go down Spring mountain for decent pho.

They serve coconut water in a coconut and will cut it open when you're done drinking it."}
{"text":"The wonderful service continues!!! They aim to please.  And all menu items are delicious with plenty of parking all the time!  Love love this place!"}
{"text":"Best pho mi sate I've had here in Vegas. So flavorful and good. The service was quick and excellent. I even heard the server making great suggestions to other diners and also talking about how they make certain broths. My kids loved their food. I am definitely coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered take out.  Placed order quickly and professionally.  He told me fifteen minutes and when I arrived it was ready addressing my name.  They were pretty busy, but I was in and out in two minutes.  He also gave me a water to go.  My $10 ordered was overwhelming in size, piping hot, and fresh ingredients.  Folks, you have earned my business."}
{"text":"Best pho in vegas. Ken the manager spends extra money to get good quality meat and you can immediately taste the difference. Everything from the broth to vegetables are prepared fresh daily. Pho comes out quick and is nice and hot. Appetizers are amazing. Overall, this place is much better than district one, pho Kim long and every other place I've tried in terms of quality and service. Clean environment too. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Things I love about Sidesteeet Pho and Grill: 

1. Servers are happy to serve you! Even the owner checks on customers with a smile!
2. Orders are steaming hot and come out quick!
Tried their pho, and I must say the noodles are cooked al dente and had a good broth, bean sprouts/jalapeno/ basil were not stale!
I tried the wonton with egg noodle soup (not a fan of this one mainly because the broth tasted too fishy for me)
Fresh spring rolls crisp vegetables inside, but the did not like their peanut sauce (not much flavor depth and tasted too much of the peanut butter, texture was too thick) 
Ban mih sandwich was really good! My mouth was not injured biting the crispy bread, meat was tender and flavorful and has a nice addition of the traditional veggies a ban mih sandwich has! 
3. Cheap!!"}
{"text":"The pho here was absolutely delicious! They have a lot of options & the prices were good. The restaurant isn't the nicest but it's a decent atmosphere. I was sat at a table with the bus boys cart piled with dirty dishes right next to us, which wasn't the best way to start out our dinner. 

The service here is what was lacked. Besides taking our order, delivering the food & collecting payment we never saw anyone. No one came to check on us at all & we never even got a refill on our waters. 

The food is great but if you're coming for a dining experience with great service, then I'd pass & try another place."}
{"text":"Really good Vietnamese comfort food with friendly attentive service.

Fresh ingredients, attention to detail in the dishes, well balanced flavors. This food tastes like it was made with love.

The green papaya salad is something special. Not spicy or heavy with fish sauce like you would expect from a Thai place, instead it's bright and fresh; more zesty than savory. Served with crispy prawn chips for textural contrast. Something you'll want to come back for.

Vermicelli bowls are excellent. Noodles perfectly al dente and served slightly warm. Lots of fresh herbs, meat on top always tender and well seasoned. BBQ pork is my top pick but the beef is also very good, sweet and peppery.

Fried egg rolls are served with generous portions of fresh herbs, lettuce and pickled veg. Fun to wrap up and dip in the fish sauce. 

Friendly family owned mom and pop vibe. Smiles all around. You can tell they take pride in the food they are serving, and rightfully so."}
{"text":"Pretty top quality pho in Vegas, despite its maybe less than authentic name.  After eating one too many buffets in Vegas, my parents was ready for some good old fashion Vietnamese food and my sister found this on Yelp and thought the reviews and photos looked good.  

When my brother heard the name, \"Sidesheet Pho and Grill,\" he was a little hesitant. But when we got their we saw the Asian staff and other Asian customers and felt reassured.  The pho was really good, as was the spring rolls and the egg rolls. 

Service was also good, plus we are about 14 people 7 kids, 7 adults and they were super accomodating for our large party."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because it has a lot of good reviews. I ordered the special combo pho and the shrimp and pork rice paper roll. The food was okay but not good enough for me to come back. I think I'll just stick to Pho Saigon 8."}
{"text":"I regularly order Vietnamese cuisine from this restaurant because the food is very authentic Vietnamese food. My wife is Vietnamese and we go to Vietnam every few years and this restaurant reminds and taste like the food in Vietnam."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! Usually eat at another Pho place but Sidestreet is closer and good too!! Keep uo the great food and great service!! Fried Rice is good as well, and you get your food fast!"}
{"text":"Really good pho. I always get the shrimp with egg noodles it's delicious. It's closer then driving to China town. Very convenient! Definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"After the movies my girl friend and I wanted to get some pho and the nearest place to red rock was this place. Why not try a new Vietnamese place? It had pretty good ratings so we went. I'm glad we decided to go. It was pretty busy when we got there but got seated fairly quickly. She took our orders and the food came out pretty quick. I ordered sea food pho and my girl friend ordered shrimp pho. It was pretty good. Lots of flavor loved the noodles the only negative thing I can say is not enough sea food in it :/  
The service was okay. Our waiter was a little rude."}
{"text":"Omg another of my favorites I am a regular here, the pho chicken is my favorite. I love so many dishes that I have tried unfortunately I don't know the names. Everything is delish and the service is really good."}
{"text":"Great service! The moment you walk in the staff greets you with a smile and a pleasant attitude. The service was fast and the food was great. The best pho I've ever had. You are given a hot pot griddle (I'm not sure what the actual name is) to cook the raw meat, something I hadn't seen before. The egg rolls are also delicious and my husband got the beef stew that he also claims is delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant... Delicious food, excellent service, and comfortable environment.."}
{"text":"An amazing pho restaurant outside of Chinatown?  Is there such a thing?  Yes!  I've been getting boba next door every week and I've been missing out on getting lunch here!  I was actually surprised to see dishes other than pho.  I tried the Lemongrass Chicken 'Bun' which sounds like something in a steam bun, but it's not!  There's vermicelli noodles in the bottom of the bowl with vegetables on top and chicken on top of that.  It actually filled me up!  The chicken was also juicy and flavorful.  The service was great as well, never had my glass half empty.  Only thing I recommend is not sitting next to the bar as it gets cold there."}
{"text":"Came in. They sat me in a booth in a corner. Gave me a glass of water and a menu. Waited 40 minutes for staff to come take my order. Nobody came and I left."}
{"text":"Omg delish!!! Had the vegetarian spring rolls wrapped in rice paper and it was so yummy!!! Also had the vermicelli bowl with veggie spring rolls! So yummy and filling!!! This spot is in my neighborhood but I never tried it! I'm missing out on this delish Vietnamese eatery!!!  Highly recommend it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so hungry, order the pork chop rice  and finish eating in 10 minutes ! So I add another order of spring rolls. It was cold today. I ask owner to bring me a small pho soup. It was so delicious and hot! Love this place. People are very friendly. Will always be back"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in town.  Consistently fresh and well-prepared.  Decent service.  No beer though :-("}
{"text":"Best pho place in Vegas!! Hands down! I have been to many places and this is such a small cute place, they have so many options and the prices are prefect for what you get!!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  I love the service and food menu. Must give it a try!! Try the won ton soup and beef stew. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is the first time I've been to Sidestreet. I ordered the Pho Ga to-go. When you order they offer you hot tea or water while you wait. That was the first thing I was really impressed with. 
When I opened the to-go bag they had everything individually bagged so the ingredients stayed fresh. The broth was still hot when I got home. I love the sauce they included to spice up the Pho. The noodles didn't stick together. The broth and the chicken tasted great. 
I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Honestly just a great solid rich Vietnamese spot! 
Lots of options, food is delicious, nice to sit inside and most of the time it's busy!

It truest is an awesome please! 
The few things that bother me about the place is that the service could've been better- especially from the younger staff and also (and that's just my crazy self) is that they don't carry fountain soda and it's a shame. 

Besides of that the food is fantastic! 
Bun, lemongrass Chicken, bun bo hue, pho. 
Delicious."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Food was fantastic. Very very fresh. Ordered the fried veggie egg rolls, and vermicelli. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I think this place is great, but the servers don't have a lot of personality, if there's an English barrier all they would really have to do is smile I would want to tip them more. Maybe hire a hostess or busser so the servers wouldnt stress so much about doing it all themselves when its busy. For like $10 an hour, u think that would greatly benefit your business..."}
{"text":"Came for the Pho, left with enough food for 3 days.. Food coma, so I'm having a difficult time organizing my thoughts.. just AMAZING! This-is-where-I'm-going-for-last-supper amazing. Light, fresh, veggies were crispy, tofu was perfectly fried crunchy and then warm and soft inside.. also had beef pho, above and beyond satisfying, and most notably light on the saltiness which was really refreshing!! Try the Vietnamese crepe with shrimp and pork too!! Ownership was really super friendly and helpful- overall this clean, modern spot had earned a spot in my dinner rotation."}
{"text":"AMAZING service with good food. And, one of the rare places that serve binh xeo!"}
{"text":"Ok...so here it is...being here for the first time you notice everything especially if your a yelper.  
So as we walked in I saw 3 people wearing the same blue shirt running around trying to clean tables...I quess we walked in as 4-5 table got up...so we had to wait for a bit...no biggie but as they sat us down the younger of the three servers I noticed he was a bit on edge...coming from restaurant background I know that look and it was a look of...we need more help in the front look...maybe a busboy or hostess to clearing off tables instead of waiters doing it...ok so we waited a good 10min before we were again acknowledge again...kind of downer because you look around and the gorgeous aroma is killing you to eat but once the same young guy now a little more collected got our order...I ordered the Pho 3 meat soup and my daughter ordered papaya salad also I heard they had a sandwich I had to try...forgot the name but we'll worth it.
I must say once the food hit the table all was forgotten the Pho was was AWESOME!!!  I've had Pho before and  most have been ok....but this one was spot on and when the owner asked is everything ok I gave him 2 thumbs up and told him we would be back..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. The portions were perfect! I ate everything and did not feel bad that I was leaving food on the table. The pho was really good and the meat portions were just Ok."}
{"text":"I've gone here quite a few times. The first time was definitely 5 stars. But for everytime I came back ever since it lost a star. The food has downgraded so much since my first visit. The customer service began to be less and less efficient. The last time I went was only a couple days ago. I was so disappointed with the coffee and noodles and the rice. I never had a bad food experienced with every item I ordered. Usually I can get away with one good thing. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing staff. Some meat served raw so FYI.  Loved it. Good stuff. Go here."}
{"text":"Happy with service and food. Everything is fresh. Multi lingual place. Speaks Vietnamese, Chinese, and English."}
{"text":"I always get the combo beef pho noodle. A little of every types of beef. So much flavor in a bowl. And the large size is too generous for one meal !  Egg rolls are the thin crispy type. Love having an pho restaurant close to home.  Some have said this isn't authentic; but very tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was excellent. Waitress was friendly and very helpful. I ordered the chicken pho. Flavor was very good. Friends ordered the filet mignon beef cubes. They were flavorful and tender. Also ordered was the seafood pho. Lots of seafood."}
{"text":"Overall: great food, not so great service.

I came in at 5pm for a quick dinner. The restaurant wasn't pack or anything but the service was very cold. Wish the service was as good as their food, how sad 

I got large combination pho and pork sandwich. Sandwich is whatever's but the pho was good."}
{"text":"Tastewise Sidestreet pho has some delicious and meaty pho with a good stock broth.  Good portions of meat in a large bowl and lots of noodles.  The noodles were chewy which is another good plus.  I don't like it when they overcook the noodles and it becomes soggy.  The noodles is cooked just right, twice in a row!  Its good when I don't want to drive all the way to china town since I live near summerlin.  Definitely one of my top 5 pho places to go, although its not my favorite soup place.   Gonna try some of their pork chop or rice plates next time.

One of the owners came out and walked around asking everyone if they enjoyed their food and talked to us for a bit.  He was very friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here today for the first time and ordered dinner for takeout. We sat at the bar sipping our drinks and chatting with the guy who served us. I watched college basketball on the big screen and my boyfriend watched some little Vietnamese kids who were watching Vietnamese cartoons on their portable DVDs  while they ate their soup. The people working there were  friendly and the timing of the food was relatively quick. We got home and Chowed Down. 5starDelicious Food!!! (dinner, drinks, & dessert ) Since the atmosphere there was nice, maybe next time we'll just eat there.
I never knew that there are Vietnamese cartoons.  Must be new, lol."}
{"text":"Best egg rolls ever.  Best coffee ever.  The pho is amazing.  Really good like soda...."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! The owner (or manager?) is super friendly and welcoming. Food comes fast and tastes delicious! They have a unique twist on the traditional bahn mi sandwich (forgot the name of it but it has an egg inside so get that one). Combination Pho and chicken wings are great as well."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the food and service is consistently good. All of the workers are very polite and everything comes out in a timely manner. I really love the rice dishes. I think that the rice dishes are the best items on the menu. The pho is great too, but I just simply love broken rice! The shrimp stuffed bean curd is a must try! It goes great with the vermecelli noodles. I wish that they had banh bao like the they orginally did when they opened. I think that is the only thing I can think of that can make this place better.
I also the love the fact that it is nearby Sumnerlin so I don't need to drive all the way to Chinatown when I need a quick and delicious Vietnamese meal."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4.5 rating. 
New pho grill in this neighborhood, great place to have authentic Vietnamese food. Went during lunch two days ago and ordered the beef stew with baguette, no baguette so went with egg noodles. The beef stew was awesome, great flavor with both tendons n meat and the sauce was very rich, tasted really good.  Would have been nice to dip the sauce with a baguette, hope they'll have it next time. They did not have two of the fried rice on the menu I wanted so I ordered the Hainan chicken rice, it was a little disappointing. Chicken was too skinny with very little meat on the bones...need improvement when sourcing chicken for this dish. Chicken was fresh and tasted good though. Prices were reasonable and service was quick and friendly, would definitely come back to try all the other items on the menu. 
They're occupying the space that was \"Oriental House\", next to Easy Life Boba."}
{"text":"Sidestreet is our go-to Vietnamese restaurant each time we visit Vegas.  It's located in a large strip mall so parking is convenient.  The restaurant is spacious with a robust menu.  My favorite is H7 Hue Tieu/Mi Thit which is clear noodle with pork.  I like it dry with a bowl of soup.  My husband tends to go with C3 which is rice with grilled pork chop.  Service is decent."}
{"text":"It's our first time here..the ambiance is beautiful,clean and relaxing. The staff are really friendly and the food is AMAZING!!!we ordered the grilled pork chop and the combination fried rice.. Everything tasted fresh and the meat is so tender.. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great Service!  Great staff!  Our food was amazing and fresh. From out of this world egg rolls and shrimp cakes, to Tasty soups and Pho. Everything was wonderful. The filet mignon cubes with grilled onions and peppers was delicious. Great little place to stop by anytime from 11am-10pm and you just might get to try Ben's Mom's Famous Flan!!!"}
{"text":"I Have been here 4 times. I like the meat quality here. It costs a maybe a dollar more than other noodle places but they always hook up the beef. If you refrigerate the broth it will turn to gelatin until reheated just like the broth I make at home. Quality place and good value!"}
{"text":"Finally had the time to stop in for a quick dinner. I love this place! We started with chicken wings then had pho with fried rice. Everything tasted good and the service was fine. I will be back to try other dishes. Great local eatery."}
{"text":"This location has changed hands at least three or four times in the last 5 years.  So when Pho Streetfood popped up, I thought to myself \"This won't last\".  That was back in the summer of 2015.  So when looking for dinner tonight, my cousin suggested we give it a try.

We both got pho...her chicken, me rare beef.  The broth was delish, the service was fast and friendly.  You can definitely tell this is a family owned establishment, in a good way.  The thai iced tea came in a mason jar (love that) and is just the right sweetness.  

I plan on coming here again and again."}
{"text":"Owner was VERY GENUINELY KIND & HELPFUL in helping me with my choices of what I was going to order! He even took into account the fact that my mother is from Taiwan and suggested that I try Choice A vs Choice B (which on the menu they look very similar)! He said that if my palate was more favorable to Taiwanese flavors, that I would probably enjoy A more vs the more traditional Vietnamese Choice B. 

Although I did not try Choice B - he was ABSOLUTELY right about me LOVING the one he suggested I order! 

I also got the shrimp & pork spring rolls with peanut sauce, the crispy fried egg rolls, & flan - all of which were delicious! Will definitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"The best pho in Vegas! We went on a Sunday night after an almost 3 hour drive from Zion and couldn't wait any longer to eat. Although it was busy, I was disappointed in how they started taking orders from customers that were seated AFTER us. I understand it's busy, but always serve accordingly! I think that's Restaurant Serving 101. The younger server did come to the rescue and took our order immediately. We ordered the wings and rare steak pho...absolutely to die for! I like how the portions are bigger than most places in Vegas. We ordered the small and I think their small is equivalent to the large phos at the other Vietnamese places we've been to. I'd like to come back to try some of their other popular items and hopefully at a not so busy time."}
{"text":"Hands down, favorite Pho/Shabu Shabu place in all of Vegas. Although I live in Mountains Edge now, (25+ min drive) I still make the trip with complete confidence that the quality, generous portions (lots of chicken in the Pho), reasonable pricing, and kind employees will be waiting for me the same as last time. I love this place. Check it out."}
{"text":"What can i say about this place? They have excellent Pho! Very Fast service and delicious food. My favorite things to order from here i can say are the Shrimp chips and the Seafood Rice Noodle Pho"}
{"text":"Friend took me here for lunch and I was a little apprehensive as I had never had Pho before. What a treat this turned out to be. The food was so flavorful and the price was great. I'll definitely be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going to diff. PHO in town and side street pho is my favorite... Their food are very tastety and service is really fast... I will definitely come back with my friends... Staffs are very friendly, especially our server (he's the young guy)..."}
{"text":"I wanted Pho bad today because I do not feel good. My son and I enjoyed our food and the service was really good. They took great care of us. Prices were also very reasonable. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great selection with some house specials that are balanced and perfect for a cold day. My favorite is the mi satè. Its a spicy phò with all the fixens built in. Never a long wait, great service, and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Drove by this restaurant so many times, finally had a chance to try it.  If u live in west side, this is the best pho u can get without going to china town area.

The restaurant had moderate ambience in a sat afternoon without super busy & noisy, with is a plus with u have a 6 month old baby with u.  By the way, they have a changing table in the ladies restroom.

We both ordered the \"pick 3 toppings\" pho, which was Delicious! And there's a lot of meat!! Yum Yum Yum!  The broth was not super clear but it tasted good! 

Chicken wings were so crispy & fingers licking good, the touch of sweet marinated was just perfect.  (Wish there were more lol)

The ice coffee made fresh when you ordered, gonna give it a good 10 mins wait.  Some other restaurant they made the coffee ahead of time.  Up to this day I still prefer mine make it fresh even it's on ice.

I know it was a causal noodle place I shouldn't be to picky.  However, I found it was interesting on the food arrival orders.  Pho came first, then chicken wings, when we all packed and ready to leave, the long waited coffee finally made it her way to the table.  Lol"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Not only is the food delicious, the owner/ staff are the best. I've been there at least 6 times already and everytime we have a great meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past two years & I love my experience every single time. I will be here all winter long :)"}
{"text":"I love Pho & there are many choices in town for it but this one is my favorite! I love the Spicy Pho with veggies and the vegetarian egg rolls. 

Try the Vietnamese coffee. It's brewed fresh at the table and is amazing!

The staff is great here and the owner is quite attentive. We love Sidestreet!"}
{"text":"My family loves pho, especially during the colder months.  Sidestreet is our favorite go-to pho restaurant.  Each of us orders something different, and so far everything has always been very flavorful and delicious.  Our favorite is the grilled pork spring rolls!!!"}
{"text":"This place was racist. My boyfriend, my boyfriends sister and I walked into this place 10 minutes before they opened because they had the \"OPEN\" sign up. We were the first ones in there. By 11am there were 4 other asian families in there and they all got attended and served before us. By the time the waiter even came to take our orders, the 4 other Asian families were already eating. The food wasn't even that good."}
{"text":"Clean & Simple! I loved vietnamese noodle here taste so yummy and broth is very refreshing! And also Employee is very sweet and kind"}
{"text":"I ordered the large seafood pho because it was only a dollar difference from the small size. I think the amount of noodles and soup was increased. As excited as I was, I was really hoping yelp wouldn't fail me. The type and quality of seafood was poor. There were a few pieces of shrimp with the tails still attached, crab sticks cut into pieces, fish balls cut in half and chunks of squid. I've never disliked shrimp so much before. The taste was so foul and the texture was stale. The noodles and broth were great though. I should've went with tofu as the source of protein."}
{"text":"Another Yelp success! In my travels, I've had just about most all of the Vietnamese dishes there are and I've eaten them all over the world that serves this food. This was some of the best I've ever had. The spring rolls were off the charts. We both had a vermicelli dishes, My wife had hers in a Pho. They had fresh coconuts, we had one. Casual ambience, excellent service and just plain delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the PHO Soup , it is better than any remedy for the Flu! They have the best customer service , in or carry out !"}
{"text":"Found this gem thanks to yelp. This is by far the cleanest pho place I've ever seen. No need to wipe down your utensils here. Water is always refilled promptly. Our waiter, Jimmy, was super friendly. The ribeye pho is a game changer. I just wish the broth didn't have such a strong cinnamon taste."}
{"text":"This review is for the Pho only. 

We were staying out in this area and I was pleased that this place had a strong Yelp star rating. So while traveling, it is sort of fun to try out Pho from various shops much different than our own Hawaii favorites. Some of the differences seem to be due to the source of ingredients. Each part of US has different wholesale sources for produce and meats. Some of the difference is due to the cooks and local preferences. MSG use is a good example of this.

MSG: Speaking of MSG. I don't know if they use it or not. The menu and website didn't say 'no MSG' so they may use it. I'm pretty sure MSG was in the flavoring for the veggie pho soup.

Venue: Nice enough shop that was about average as far as Pho shops go. Easy to find. Family friendly.

Food: 

Veggie Tofu:  I had the veggie tofu pho. They asked if I wanted beef or veggie based soup. I wanted the veggie based. The veggies were fine but undercooked because the soup was not hot enough. Usually, the very hot broth continues to cook the broccoli and other vegetables perfectly. The veggie soup base tasted like it was a bullion cube dissolved in hot water and not a dedicated veggie broth. In their defense, it is very likely that this is an extremely low volume item at this shop. Las Vegas is more of a meat and potatoes city. It would not be practical to make special soup for this if few patrons order it. But, the bottom line is that it was a bit of a disappointment. Other Pho shops can make an excellent meat-free soup. Overall it was pretty bland and required some additional sauce to spice it up. It was still 3 star pho.

Beef Pho: My wife got the P2 combo pho. She liked it and said it was 4 stars. We got the small size bowls as they seemed big enough.

We're not likely to go back. But if we do I'll try a different dish. My wife would get the combo again,gladly."}
{"text":"Omg!! This place has amazing food!  This our first time here.  I'm glad we choose Sidestreer Pho & grill! I ordered the \"dry pho\"or vermicelli noodles with BBQ pork, egg roll & prawns.  It didn't disappoint, it was delicious! The ambiance was nice, the restaurant is clean, the service was amazing!  I will totally recommend Sidestreet Pho to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I come here way more than I need to. But it's sooooo worth it...I haven't found a place to beat this one for Pho. The broth is something out of this world!"}
{"text":"This was just okay.  I ordered the bun bo hue and there was minimal meat and the noodles seemed a little over cooked.  The broth was also a tad salty and I usually like salt.  I'd venture a little further to Chinatown for a better bun bo hue.  The service was attentive and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the P1. Choose 3 meats. I chose tendon, tripe and meatball.  Added (up charge) rare steak.  Came to roughly $12.  Without up charge it would have been just under $10. In my opinion, this was one of the top broths that I have tasted so far."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!!!!

The decor, the menu and of course, the amazing customer service!!!!!!!

The food was delicious and really hit the spot after my vegas hangover!"}
{"text":"I love this place... LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! I dont even think to go anywhere else for Pho or wonton soup. I could eat here everyday of my life I swear."}
{"text":"Originally, I raved about this pho spot. It has been my regular go-to since and I come here almost every week to get my fix. However, the past few visits I have had here were rather disappointing and upon learning from some of the wait-staff the owner has changed, it is obvious from the way the food is served that things have taken a turn. 

The portion size is entirely different; the meat is sparse and the noodles stick together as if they were sitting in the bowl hours before the broth had been poured over it to serve. The green onion and cilantro garnish has also whittled down significantly.

I'm rather disappointed because the consistency of this restaurant was strong and suddenly, with a a management change, has become like every other disappointment. What's more disappointing is the wait-staff mentioned a significant pay cut on top of the fact the quality and quantity of the food was being reduced."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite pho place only 5 min from home no need to go to Chinatown. Highly recommend you all must try. It's so great to have a delicious Vietnamese place so close to home we will be regulars here. No more pho 8 their service has gone to pot tonight I had the pho with egg noodles and roast pork the broth was piping hot tasted great the bbq pork was fantastic."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Great flavor for the pho. And the jerky papaya salad is great too. Always quality and fast lunch. Keep up the good work, I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"SOLID.

Wanted some pho the other night and decided to give this location a whirl. Its pretty close to me and not having to drive all the way into chinatown is a plus. 

FOOD: This is the first time i've seen a Vietnamese menu place pho in the \"create your own\" category. Their whole pho menu is that and it saves tons of space. +1 for thought out menu. THe food i got (large pho with brisket, tendon, flank, iced coffee with condensed milk) was good. Pho is pretty standard but they executed with well. 

ATMO/SERVICE: THis location definitely has a bit more character than other pho places I've been to. Nice ambience and space. The service was good and the prices were great. 

Will definitely be heading back as my pho cravings increase with the cooling temps on the \"fall\"."}
{"text":"The employees are so welcoming. This place is amazing. They treat every order amazingly. I have had takeout and dined in. Every time my food has been exemplary. It is so delicious. I feel like management really cares about customer opinions and well being. I will go here again and again."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. The old Vietnamese lady serving us is really RUDE ! She has a b*tchy attitude too. Caught her blowing her nose in the back without washing her hands!!! Food is good but seriously treat your customer with your respect or quit."}
{"text":"Always a challenge to find egg noodles Pho. Most places offer the rice vermicelli noodles. 

Was glad we drove out to try. 
Beef Stew Pho w egg noodles
Bbq pork, shrimp w egg roll rice noodles. 
Seafood pho w egg noodles. All were good. 

Staff is very attentive. Food served at a quick rate. I received one entree before our egg roll appetizer. Seafood Pho was second and Beef Stew Pho was last. 

Nice atmosphere and clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a really good bowl of crab noodle soup so, I looked online before deciding where to take my mom. A pic on Yelp showed this place had the crab noodles with all the good stuff with it like shrimp, pork blood and tofu. It was a bit pricy compared to places in Chinatown but, willing to pay high price for a good dinner. Lol.

My mom & I both ordered Bun Reu. The flavor was good. The only few things that would have made Bun Reu a lot better were:
- Noodles: noodles were undercooked, they were not soft.
- Soup: The soup itself was not hot enough & got cold quickly.
- Tofu: It was a different kind. Should be the one with less stuffing in it. Or maybe cut the tofu thinner so that it wouldn't over power the flavor. Maybe it's just me. Lol

I do like the following though:
- Soup: good flavor, similiar to ones you get in CA or VN.
- Shrimp: 4 fresh shrimps. Not frozen bc I don't usually like frozen seafood.
- Pork blood: not chewy. Not watered down, not mixed with something else, if I was right. Lol"}

{"text":"Great banh mi sandwich with egg and pork loaf. My half-vietnamese wife said the bun bo hue was the best she had in Vegas - spicy and has chicken skin, funky meat parts that she loves but Americans might not go for. The broken rice dish was not up to par (except for the egg meatloaf which was the best I've had in Vegas) so I would skip that but the rest of the items are tasty. Lots of Vietnamese people eating here so you know they are keeping it real."}
{"text":"Honestly we only come here because it's the closest to our house in Summerlin but the customer service is really great and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Immediately greeted when my family & I walked in. One of the servers was kind enough to assist us with removing the chair & replacing it with a high chair. I really like how he was kind and patient with us. So the service was wonderful. 

My family and I ordered pho & I had the vermicelli noodles with lemongrass pork & egg roll. 

Their food is not bad. The pho was a little bit bland but hot enough. The vermicelli was delicious. 

I will come back again , definitely. Good person & food."}
{"text":"Holy Wow!!! The service was incredible, and the food was seriously some of the best I've ever had. I was totally blown away. I will be back again and again for sure. Ohh.. and the price, Entree, drink & dessert came to $17 and I'm taking home enough leftovers for a whole other meal... Simply fantastic"}
{"text":"I am the biggest lover of pho or any type of noodle really so while driving around looking for a place to go for lunch we come across this gem. First off very friendly they say is right away and when they brought the high chair out I see them cleaning it thoroughly with Clorox wipes which makes me happy to know they care that much. There were so many options but I went with the wonton and noodle soup with brisket. I was a little apprehensive as the soup smelled fishy, I cautiously took a bit and was pleased with the taste not fishy at all! My baby ate his own tiny little bowl and left nothing. I definitely recommend this place and we'd be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. I think the food is just ok, I've eaten at several other Vietnamese places and this doesn't compare to those. This is a convenient location that has ok food. I always find the service to be unfriendly. Maybe if they were friendlier I'd like the food more? Food isn't bad, it's just not something I'd be calling home about"}
{"text":"Went to Sidestreet grill again.  Ordered the Lemmon grass shrimp and egg roll rice noodles. The grill shrimps on screwers were very tasty. Egg rolls were crispy and delicious.  The only thing I think can be improved is the fish sauce.  It wasn't salty enough.  Lack of the usual kick after added to the noodle mix.  Still, it was a very good comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Seriously should be half the price what they are charging.  A meat plate for $14.50 that was mostly rice?  Is everybody that rich?????"}
{"text":"Everything was really good, started with pot stickers. Then the lemongrass chicken egg roll with noodles SO good. Everything tastes fresh and light. Will be coming back. Yums."}
{"text":"Awesome pho! Great service nice people! I had the pho and it was delicious! And they have Chinese also!"}
{"text":"I love I love I love! I've been looking for a good Vietnamese spot ever since we moved from San Jose. I went to a few Pho places and got vermicelli bowls but it didn't remind me of home. Usually the fish sauces were watered down but this place is the closes to authentic there is! The sauce was not watered down and it was delicious (For those who understand me and like Nuoc Mam)! Everything we had so far... amazing! We got the vegetarian egg rolls and it was packed with tofu and veggies. Golden and crispy! Droool!! I love how you can customize your own Pho bowl too! For example, some places you order #1 and it comes with all kinds of meat but you only eat certain things and they charge you for every add on. This place, add what you like if you want! The tendon, is tender and buttery by the way! Not so chewy which I fell in love with. The broth is perfect too! We also got the fried noodles with all the delicious meats and veggies. The sauce was great!! I think that's my favorite thing. I also ordered the fresh lime soda. It was something I have to order from now on! Perfect amount of sweetness and just refreshing! All those who drink soda and are trying to cut it, try it! They use Perrier :) which is my fave! I can't wait to try more here. Cheers!!!"}

{"text":"Very good food, very well priced and good service! Probably the best Pho I have had since I moved to Las Vegas!"}

The soup came out fast and was very tasty!  The Service was great! ! When the owner came out to put my son's soup in a to go container, he even said he would add more broth...really?? No one's ever done that before! Awesome"}
{"text":"One of the only pho places I actually ENJOY and the service is amazing love love love this place"}
{"text":"Their pho is good and worth getting particularly in cooler weather. It is also a fairly good deal. I'm not too fond of their other dishes, but the pho is a great option for a meal, particularly the combo, which includes a nice mix of items."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place based on the reviews of other yelpers on the way out from Las Vegas. Service and food was brought out fast which I appreciated. Ordered many things to try: Pho Dac Biet, Bun Bo Hue, Banh Xeo, and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Pho had a good portion of meat, but a little bland. Bun Bo Hue was pretty good. Great flavor to the broth. Banh Xeo had a great crisp to it, however, a little too much ratio of bean sprouts compared to other ingredients inside. Vietnamese Coffee was the typical you'd get."}
{"text":"It's rare that I give out 5 stars. This place has been on my bookmarks for a long time, as my usual Pho eating friend always likes to head to Chinatown. Well, she's not around, so I dropped in here on a Friday night around 7pm to give it a try.

Nice big space with plenty of tables. A little confusing where to go to be seated but a lovely young lady saw me and escorted me to a table. The place was probably 1/2 full, but only the girl and the owner were working the tables. And they were moving fast......I ordered and had food in front of me within 15 minutes. Excellent service 5/5.

I had the Pho Tai Nam and a BBQ pork spring roll. The Pho was very good, had a light, citrus broth before I even added lime. Plenty of meat, probably more meat in this bowl than any other place in town I have been. $7.95 for a small and it is plenty. The BBQ pork spring roll was also very good, with plenty of BBQ pork and not just all noodles. The flavor of the cilantro came through nicely.Add 2.99 for a thai ice tea and my bill was only $16+.  5/5 for the food.

Now I wish I had come here earlier because its convenient to where I live and has good food. The owner was friendly and proud of his place, and I could see why because this is a nice place to get some food and a great value!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the good reviews. I'm always on the lookout for good Vietnamese restaurants. I was near the area & decided to give this place a try. 

I ordered the lemon grass chicken, papaya salad, and my boyfriend had beef stew with rice noodles.
The lemon grass chicken was good, I just wish it had more flavor to it. 9/10 
The papaya salad was really really good. I'm a big Papaya salad lover & this one hit the spot!! You could choose what kind of meat you want in your papaya salad. I got shrimp & pork. 10/10
The beef stew was delicious. The meat was so tender and it literally melt in my mouth. 10/10

The service was outstanding! I never been to a Asian restaurant where they really cared about their customers. You could tell they were genuine about it also. They always refilled our waters and they even packed our food for us & gave us a few chopsticks to bring home. Definitely coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"We ate our late lunch here on a weekday. There weren't many customers since it was past lunch time, but there were several tables that were not cleaned after the previous customers left. It was messy. The service was horrible on top of that and their food, meh. For whatever reason, the servers were acting like they were busy and we were not welcome. Then we all got sick after eating there, which we guessed was too much MSG. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Drive across town to check this place out only because of a picture on yelp that showed pork buns. Well.. they no longer make them lol. Got the pho with rare beef and beef ball, and egg rolls. Pho was great and the egg rolls were ehh ok. I guess if I'm ever in the area and crave some pho I would stop by again."}
{"text":"This place is 5 star pho! The soup broth is delicious and made from scratch, and the portion of meat/noodles/broth is huge. I have tried several other dishes including the raddish cake and eggs, as well as the fresh spring rolls. I have zero complaints. This place is spot on and the owner is very friendly and cares about his restaurant a lot. This place is very convenient for people who live in Summerlin and are not very keen on driving to Spring Mountain. For tourist looking for good pho, this place will not disappoint! I've been here several times, and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Vietnamese person eating at a Vietnamese restaurant and it went okay? I ordered a broken rice dish and all of my other friends ordered pho. Funny enough, my meal came out first. Usually pho is the fast prepped one while the rice dishes come out later because of the grilled meat...

My meal was dry overall. I ordered C3, Com Tam Bi Cha Thit Nuong. The rice was dry since it was long grain which is usually different from the traditional short grain. The meat was dry since it felt like it was sitting around from someone else's previous order. It could've also been because I think the meat marinade had a little lemongrass in it. The soup and the fish sauce that was given along side it to ease the meal was blah.

Overall, I didn't finish my meal and I didn't ask to take it home. I'll try to come back when I'm in the area, but I'll stick to eating Viet food back at home in California."}
{"text":"Excellent balance of flavor. The curry chicken had rich curry, spicy heat and slight sweetness balanced together so you could appreciate each of the flavors. Cucumber and tomato were fresh & especially enjoyed pickled  cabbage. The combination Pho had tender and flavorful tendon, steak, flank, brisket & tripe in a flavorful broth, which I enjoyed all of it. Most Pho broths at other restsurants are too salty to finish; just would suggest serving with warmer temperature so it stays hot through the meal. Basil and bean sprouts were  fresh & crispy. Rice and vermicelli were cooked just right and everything served in generous quantity."}
{"text":"The broth is okay for the pho. 
I really wanted bun xeo, so stopped by here. It was overly cooked and crispy, and wasn't as good as I've had it in the past."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. The meat was old and not freshly cooked. It smelled funny and it must have been heated in the microwave? Normally, when you have rice noodles with meat it comes fresh. Not so here. BTW, the server gave me a refund and that's why they're getting 2 stars instead of 1. I think it's important to tell everybody the food is not as great as Viet Noodle Bar at Spring mountain."}
{"text":"Best pho. And we've eaten a lot of pho. 

Ordering take out here is our favorite. They package the pho so you can assemble at home! Every pho item is separated. It's glorious."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to lunch at Sidestreet Pho and Grill based on its location and the reviews on Yelp. I'm sorry to say it was a big disappointment. I was seated immediately upon arrival and provided a menu. Since I had reviewed the menu on line I knew I wanted to try B3 which is Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (rice vermicelli, grilled lemongrass pork and eggrolls). My dish was dropped off and that was the last time I saw the server. The noodles were very good and the fish sauce as well which I'm sure is purchased. The grilled pork looked pre prepared and was small pieces, not like the grilled strips of pork I've had elsewhere. The eggrolls were disappointing as well. I ate what I could and then had to wait for a check which I finally got by waving at the cashier. Pretty disappointing food and service; I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad! Reasonably priced and many options to choose from. I like the fact that you can mix and match and create your own pho. My fiancé was feeling under the weather so I decided he needed some pho in his life which is how I ended up here, lol."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Good service and nice atmosphere. The food is excellent and I didn't have to drive all the way to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Side street pho well the pho was a little bland and it was luke warm the day i went.  I went here a few times before and this time it just wa sn't it. The atmosphere feels like a side street and it was a cool theme.  Service was okay, price is fair I guess if you are in the area of Desert Breeze it be okay to stop by."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!!   I am so happy there is a great Pho place in the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing that this pho spot had close to five stars I was pretty excited to give it a try. However, I would soon be extremely disappointed. I ordered the vermicelli salad and my friend had beef pho. Both of us were completely underwhelmed by the flavor of our dishes as both were pretty bland. 

Service was pretty good. Our server was attentive and food came out at an expected pace. Prices are comparable to other pho restaurants. 

Overall, happy to have tried this place but definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I've been here 3 times in 2 wks trying a variety of items on the menu. Everything from Pho to Hu Tieu to Bun Bo Hue to Com Tam was excellent. Brought the family after my trial runs and wife concurs. We are self-described experts in Vietnamese cuisine. 

Key to the noodle soups is the broth, which was full of flavor and richness. I was impressed, with fantastic food, courteous service, and casual, clean setting. Now we have a great go-to place around the corner. Hope this restaurant succeeds and stays around. There have been 4 previous restaurants in this spot in 4 years."}
{"text":"The broth was amazing!! And full of flavor. I didn't have to add sriracha sauce like I normally do at other places  lol. The service was great and quick also. I would definitely come here again. I got the chicken noodle pho soup."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, but now switching to vegetarian it really limits the selection. The waiter there was great very helpful. The vegetable Pho was decent, The vegetable broth tasted kind a like boiled water, but the noodles were great. And the vegetable Eggrolls (4 per order) were great especially with the lettuce wraps on the outside. And for the drinks I had a pot of hot Jasmine tea which was nice. And my wife had a fresh lemonade, which is not fresh lemonade, (probably Lipton's) haha."}
{"text":"Love the Asian theme decors, staff were very welcoming and friendly, food was great and since it was our first time they were very formative on the orders of what it is and recommendation.. we'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"There Pho is excellent.  I have had it all over town.  There is one place I like the broth slightly better.  However, I visit this place often because they make a homemade chili sauce for the Pho that makes it taste fantastic.  The chili sauce is loaded with garlic and I wish it was hotter but yum yum yum.  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"We had pho and was impressed by its flavor and quality.  Very good beef quality and even the meatballs are made from good quality beef. The soup is rich in flavor. It's not salty at all. The tofu shrimp paste is crispy outside and with soft filling inside. Very tasty. Ingredients are super fresh and prepared well. We'll definitely return to this place when we visit LV again."}
{"text":"Came here with family in town , we all love Pho and I have visited many places in Las Vegas and I have never had as good of an experience as I had here, today. It was really close to my house and a cute environment inside. Also, clean! The service was great, I am so excited we found this place!! I had rare steak pho, the broth was so amazing. I didn't need to add much to it at all. We all shared the fried vegetable egg roll and it was fantastic. I would recommended this place to anyone."}
