{"text":"The gyros here are sooooo good! And the fries were soft and nice too. I enjoy it I go there pretty often just for the gyros and ice cream"}
{"text":"I come here very often, since I work down the street, and the service is always fast and friendly! But today, I forgot my wallet and was totally embarrassed because I had just ordered my food. The owner, who was working, recognizes me from coming in so often and told me don't worry about it just come back later or tomorrow! Such a stand up guy! He is the true spirit of hospitality!"}
{"text":"I can't confidently give anything more than 3 stars because I have limited experiences here. A friend and I occasionally succumb to the donut cravings that we face every day. Yum Yum's is a great donut option--I've had lemon filled and a creme filled donut and they were both exactly what I wanted. We'll definitely be back for donuts and I'd like to someday try the other food options, since the service here is wonderful."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first encounter with Yum Yums was during a visit for work. I am often too cheap to go buy breakfast on my own time, but needed to dine out since I was out of town. I try to mind my expenses and was upset I did not find this place the first day I was here. Mary's little lamb is one of my favorite treats. I have since moved to Cleveland .... Long story longer - the same gentleman who owns the cafe was there from my trip two years ago. I remember him because he has a warmth in his eyes that you do not often see. It's as if he is happy to have you there as a guest, as if he is happy to feed you. I am not a fan of donuts - but I really enjoy the egg and cheese Gyro on an everything bagel for $4. 

Why are you still reading this? Go get breakfast and coffee at Yum Yums."}
{"text":"I work Downtown just a very short distance from Yum Yums.  I go there frequently both for breakfast and lunch. Their breakfast sandwiches are actually very good and so is the lavazza coffee! Donuts aren't the best I've ever had, but they are still pretty good! For lunch I like to get a 1/4 pd. Gyro. It's plenty filling for lunch and only 4 dollars!  ( anyone who frequents or works downtown, knows it's hard to find anything to eat for lunch under 6 or 7 dollars. ) He has 3 or 4 variations,  but my favorite is the Moroccan Gyro. However they are all very good! The owner is usually there during the day, and he is a very friendly, nice guy.  So if you are in the area. Give Yum Yums a try! I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"What a great little hole-in-the-wall place to get some breakfast! A co-worker and I are trying out different coffee/breakfast places and this one was on our list. The man who owns the place is very nice and very quick to serve. He understands that people are in a hurry to get to work a lot of the time. The prices are more than fair. I've definitely paid more for coffee that was just as good. The donuts are very good and very fresh. I ordered a dozen for a birthday in the office and everyone loved them. Only $.99 per donut or $8.99 for a dozen. That's a pretty good deal to me! Will definitely return to try one of the breakfast gyros."}
{"text":"Coffee is great and bagels and pastries are always fresh. Gyros are ok (meat is a tad dry, but fresh veggies and tasty tzatziki sauce made up for it). The owner is the nicest guy ever! He's quick to make conversation and remembers your order if you come more than twice!"}
{"text":"Once a year I work and stay in the downtown area of Cleveland.  This is my go to place every morning before I go from my hotel to the Q Arena.  The guy who owns this hole in the wall is from Morocco and is very friendly.  He makes all the sandwiches as soon as you order it and is very fast about it."}
{"text":"A great place for food downtown, especially for breakfast! If you're in a time crunch however, this isnt the place. I waited like 10 minutes for a bagel, no bueno but i wont be negative. I also picked up a bakery platter for the office, 3 dozen for $35 which for ME was a little steep, but the office said the donuts and pastries were fresh and awesome so i guess it was well worth it. It came with donuts, cinn. rolls and eclairs. Theyre so much more than goodies though, they also serve gyros and wraps, salads and sandwiches. coffee, tea, you name it.its an all around perfect little breakfast/quick brunch spot if youre in the mood for some fresh food!"}
{"text":"My experience was ok, not great.
I ordered 2 dozen donuts for the office and while they were good, they didn't seem as fresh as I have had in the past from other places.
I enjoy trying new things when traveling, and even though it is better than Dunkin Donuts, it wasn't by much. I will give it another try when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Food: 3

This is a great little location, but somewhat average offerings. The friendly service was the best part."}
{"text":"It is UNBELIEVABLE that employees that are rude and so unjustifiablely impolite can manage to keep their jobs! It's a shame that this place will no longer be on my list of great places because of unprofessional staff members that just don't care anymore and it seems to be a trend in the Cleveland area. Very sad...VERY SAD! If you are looking for friendly customer service, this is not the spot!!!!!"}
{"text":"slow service

questionable donuts

wrong orders

just keep walking by

nothing special

yum yum, more like..."}
{"text":"Corned beef croissant was ok. I had to ask for my donut three times then the guy questioned that I had already paid for my donut. Donut was stale. Only good thing was the coffee."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  We ordered breakfast sandwiches. Service was really slow for a game day ... took 20 mins to get food and we were first in line."}
{"text":"Great little place in a convenient location! I've only tried their breakfast sandwiches which are great. Love the sausage, egg and cheese on their buttery croissants. Usually only one person working the counter which can make service somewhat on the the slow side. However, they are always friendly and make sure that I am happy with my food. Haven't tried the coffee here but they serve lavazza :) Will also have to try the gyros here next time. Great no-fuss place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were ok but nothing special. Took forever to get our order. Limited selections of donuts and only a few flavors of iced cream, so for all the write up jazz pretty disappointed. Frankly would have moved on if it hadn't started raining."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are really for the friendly service I received. My breakfast sandwich left a lot to be desired. I had a croissant, which was obviously frozen and reheated. The texture was tough and it had a bit of a stale after taste. Again, the service was quick and friendly. Unfortunately it didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"I can only speak about the donuts at this place, but they are some delicious donuts! When a craving for donuts hits while you're downtown, I highly recommend hitting up Yum Yum's!"}
{"text":"Was in town 3 mornings and ate breakfast here twice.  Great breakfast sandwiches and donuts.  I'll definitely be back the next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for breakfast on a Monday morning. We each ordered a breakfast sandwich and coffee. My sandwich, which was bacon egg and cheese on a croissant, was delicious! The croissant was buttery and soft and everything else was cooked to perfection. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his sandwich as well. I believe his was sausage egg and cheese on a bagel. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because we did have to wait a while for our food as there was only one person working. (He was very friendly, by the way.) However, we would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum's has an awesome location visible from the street on Euclid Avenue. When I used to work Downtown, my colleagues and I would stop here frequently for breakfast. Now, i'll still stop in whenever I can to enjoy their breakfast (though I will admit, i'm no longer a morning person). 

Yum Yum's is open 6am-6pm everyday. To my knowledge, that's one of the earliest breakfast stops in Downtown Cleveland, period. Bless their souls. Be forewarned, it is a small operation with a few employees, so be sure to block out a few extra minutes. Also, morning. So, yeah. There's probably going to be a line. Take a deep breath, its fine. 

There's a few small tables and chairs, but this is as equally a grab-and-go place as it is a sit down place. Yum Yum's is locally owned and the owner is very kind and helpful. I'm not usually a big coffee drinker, so I tend to go with a hot chocolate, while my friends go for a black coffee. The gyro breakfast croissant is delicious... its big, so i'm usually full through lunch! If you're staying at a nearby hotel, take a walk over, grab a croissant/donut/bagel etc. and take a walk to the brand new Public Square. Skip the McDonalds in the AM. Head to Yum Yum's!"}
{"text":"On a cold day - this place was delicious. All there of us were very very pleased with our beverages. I ordered the hot chocolate, my friends both ordered coffee and they were some of the best coffees they had ever ordered (or so they say) so of course I had to write a review.

Yum."}
{"text":"Woke up with a bagel craving. This place is near my hotel. I called ahead to make sure they sold bagels, they did. Awesome! As soon as I got back to my hotel room and unwrapped my bagel, it was 100% obvious that this was a bagel from a bag... like, I'm talking grocery store bread aisle, pre-packaged (Thomas'?) not bakery made. I can taste and feel all the preservatives immediately. That's also why even though I ordered it toasted (and it was) it felt more like it was microwaved, because all the preservatives in the pre-packaged bagels prevent them from getting crispy when toasted. Cream cheese was same quality. Gross. I couldn't even finish it. Not what I expected from a coffee shop or place with good reviews on their breakfast. 

The thing that really gets me is that these bagels are displayed in open baskets behind the counter, making them look like they are bakery fresh, or possibly made in shop. However, the worker didn't get my bagel from there, he went in the back to get my bagel and brought it back out when it was done being toasted and cheesed. Therefore, I didn't see him take it out of the bag he likely had back there. Had I known, I would have asked for my money back before leaving with the bagel. 

Suggestion to the store, it looks like other people like your coffee and breakfast food. Don't cheapen the quality of everything else by selling bagels, I could have walked to the grocery store and been more satisfied. Stick to what you know."}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting Cleveland in the morning. Ordered a half dozen donuts. Over half of the donuts were stale. Boston creme filling tasted sour and rancid. Definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly. Good coffee. Great doughnuts. Live the corned beef and eggs breakfast sandwich"}
{"text":"The worst sandwhich I have ever eaten. Everything was microwaved. My finances sausage was so over microwaved that it was hard and he could not even bite it. I also go a donut and it was hard and obviously old. Do not go here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little quick breakfast option! Ordered the Turkey sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It was great! Tons of donut options!!! Didn't get one but they looked amazing! Definitely would love to go back for one when I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in on 3/04 and ordered a lot of items off their menu for a bunch of people. The gentleman working the cashier was very nice and patient. Everyone loved the food! The croissant sausage, egg and cheese was honestly amazing. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiched here are so fricken good and reasonably priced. Cornedbeef egg and cheese Croissant and a coffee. Now that's a winner."}
{"text":"I love Yum Yum's! The interior is tiny and there are few employees. I've stopped here a bunch of times for breakfast and lunch. I love getting the gyros! They have tasty donuts and pastries in the morning.  Everyone who works here is super friendly which makes patronizing this place even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place on Euclid with Donuts, Gyros, Sandwiches, Breakfast sandwiches, and Salads/wraps. Nothing fancy about it- just quick, good food if you're in a hurry or are craving a quick gyro! The guy who owns this place is SUPER friendly! i thought I shoved a 20 in my pocket as I walked over one evening from my apartment and after my food was ready, I realized I must have left it on my counter. I told him I'd run over and grab it and he said to take my food and just come back at my convenience. Of course I ran up and ran right back, but that was extremely nice of him! Everything is reasonably priced and it's all tasty. I can't figure out if the donuts are just dunkin donuts that he brings in and resells, but they do look like it (i could be wrong though). They brew Lavazza coffee which is pretty good!"}
