{"text":"This has been a fixture in North Huntington for decades mainly because of the excellent food and the very decent people who work there. Unfortunately I haven't been to the new location yet but every few months I get delivery and they're always cheerful and accommodating. Slightly more expensive than some but for the quality of the food and the service definitely go!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in town. They've just moved into a new building across the street. We stopped in to try their sushi roll lunch special, which is a new offering for them. It was amazing! And the new location is beautiful."}
{"text":"This place is okay. They seem to have a few good selections, but if you veer off, then you will end up disappointed. The spicy crabmeat salad is very good. It has a mayo base and delivers a fresh, cool bite. The steamed dumplings are average fare, I've had better and I've had worse. The fried rice is also pretty tasty. None of the lunch specials have really wowed me. I ordered a shrimp lunch special the other day and had four pieces of shrimp. Pretty disappointed about that. Overall, it's decent if you're in the area, but not worth a special trip."}
