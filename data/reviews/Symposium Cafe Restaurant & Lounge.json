{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Friday morning and sat on the patio.  Very relaxing and food was good.  I had the French toast with fruit and a side of sausage.  Their farm sausage was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Chicken parm tasted like it was heated up,  California chicken sandwich was decent at best. Manager gave me attitude because I said the food was okay. Definitely not a dinner place more of a desert /drinks place. Hopefully I don't get the shits."}
{"text":"Not a good place.. order took forever & was not happy with the food or brushed off commentary by the management !! It does have a nice look to it though !!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the Markham/Unionville area.  It's so easy to get to (by car), there's plenty of free parking, it's affordable, and has a swanky enough feeling to be the perfect place to meet with friends or clients.  Comfortable, welcoming, nice and bright, a variety of seating options and nice wait staff.  Food is good and decently priced...plus I saw someone eating thair *amazing* looking waffle and ice cream dessert...so you may want to try that! :D   They also have some nice flavoured coffess, etc., so a great place overall to sit and chat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it. Shared the eggs Provençal. And a yummy Cuban sandwich. Service was attentive to."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a number of times. They make some great breakfast dishes. My favourite is the French Toast with White Chocolate.  It has such an amazing flavour. One time I order this and they gave me the White Chocolate that was so watery and for sure not chocolate. I returned the little cup and they provided me with a new one. Just one word of warning, this chocolate should be thick, however on this visit it wasn't.  I can see how this place gets busy on weekends. Ive been pretty lucky since small parties can be seated very quickly with only a few minutes of waiting.  The second last time I was there, they had 2 Fergie songs on repeat that was playing throughout the restaurant. It was pretty funny, they must only like those 2 songs.  I saw people getting annoyed but Im not sure if anyone complained."}
{"text":"Went with a large group in their party room. There were about 20 of us and 2 servers. Slow and rude service. Cockroach fell off the serving tray on to my mother's food!!! Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place!   My friends and I came here for a friend's birthday and to see the fireworks on Canada Day. I called a few days before to ask if they did anything for birthdays and they said to come in and notify the server. Our waitress was really sweet and understanding. I spoke to her on the side and picked a slice of cake (they are MASSIVE and FREE for the birthday person!). The food was pretty good and the prices are really cheap. I just got a burger, but I really enjoyed it.   For dessert, I had a brownie cake that was definitely worth it for the price and our bills were pretty low all together.   Only issue was our waitress was rather slow at times. Even towards the end of the night when there were barely any people in the restaurant, she took her time coming to speak with us. We ended up missing half the fireworks and I think this could have been avoided had she been a little faster. We did tell her we were going to see the fireworks but by then it was a little too late.   Regardless, I would definitely go again and would recommend others to do so as well!"}
{"text":"Nice place, nice ambiance and above all good food. The restaurant is managed by Ali, a super friendly guy that will do a lot to accommodate you."}
{"text":"We love coming here for a date night! All our customer servers are always so friendly with us."}
{"text":"Please do not expect any quality service from this restaurant.   1. It took more than one hour for the food to arrive. 2. The waitress rolled her eyes constantly when we needed the simplest things like water refills. In addition, she muttered random inhospitable words to us thinking we couldn't hear her.  3. The manager arrived after one hour and explained that it was their printer malfunctioning which caused orders and cooks to be slow. (Whats wrong with handwriting down the orders instead??)  Three families left the restaurant during the whole ordeal.   When the food finally came, it was okay but not spectacular. Our group ordered breakfast items that you would see in other breakfast establishments.  I cannot give this place more than 1 star as the service was absolutely abysmal. Avoid this place at all costs. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Congrats, Symposium Aurora. You have received my first 1-star review.   I went here with 4 other girlfriends, tonight. Yes, I left that upset that I had to write my review right away.  My crepes and ice cream were fine. Nothing above average, but fairly priced, so no complaints.  The service however, was atrocious.  Our server was barely audible and had a really blasé attitude. She wrapped up her shift so we cashed out at about 6:30. At 7:15, after no one had checked in on us, one of the managers approached us asking us how much longer we'd be. After seeing our shocked faces he proceeds to tell us he has a reservation he'd like to sit here. Well, let me tell you, it wasn't exactly hopping, there were LOTS of other tables. But I was wearing my work sweater so I couldn't exactly be aggressive about it.  Our convo went something like this:  Manager: How much longer will you be because I have a reservation in 10-15 minutes and I'd like to seat them here: Samm: We would have ordered another drink if a server had come around. M: ...... *stares at me* S: We were told by our other server that we could stay here till 1am if we wanted!! M: *laughs at my comment* S: The service here is very poor.... M: I'm sorry you feel that way.  We proceeded to leave vowing never to come back. I know I'm not the first to write a bad review, but seriously.... SOMETHING needs to change here.  ***I have updated this post saying that the first of our friends was told when she arrived that this man was actually the owner.... need I say more about that general attitude? If his people skills are that lacking, no wonder the service is that terrible."}
{"text":"When the drinks we ordered came a little weaker than I preferred, our server and both managers offered (unprompted) to replace it... twice!  Then we got the bill, and the drinks were comped (free)! Our server was friendly and engaging, and the food (the chicken souvlaki and salmon pesto) were excellent.  Very happy with the experience and will definitely be going back.   Great job guys!"}
{"text":"A franchise recently opened in Oak Ridges~  Went for brunch before shopping trip.  Nice atmosphere, really cool, quiet, spacious and airy.  Decor followed a lot of European wall art pieces.  Seems kind of dated.  Our table was not well cleaned, bread crumbs were observed.  We asked for extra cleaning.  The girl seem reluctant and quite absentminded.  (as if we are thin air, nonexistent).  Friend ordered a Eggs Benjamin ($12.45), which looked really good, but never got to try.  Potato wedges were crunchy.  I ordered a French Toast with White chocolate cinnamon ($12.55) which also came with a fruit salad.  The fruits were really fresh and sweet.  It was not the canned fruits you get from supermarket, where the fruits are submerged in sugar juice.  But the french toast was disappointing.  The bread was burnt, moist and soggy.  It was like soaked in water kind of texture.  It was lacking the crunchiness I hoped for.  White chocolate cinnamon was savory, just a good sauce combination.  Other than the cinnamon sauce, they give you maple syrup on the side.  But because of the sad french toast, I did not enjoy the brunch much.  verdit:  if you ever go for bunch, do not try their french toasts."}
{"text":"Beautiful decoration, perfect place to hang out with few friends while enjoying a delicious meal. The service was wonderful, fast and really polite. My burger was cooked perfectly, came quick without a long wait. Pretty noisy place with all the people and music in the background. Also a comfortable to relax and have a meeting. Place is Awesome, will definitely come back with more friends."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening, place wasn't packed but getting there.  Service was extremely slow and not due to being busy, but due to the fact the waiters were just standing around chatting.  My husband and i overheard the table beside us complaining at how long it was taking.  No one came over to explain.  After an hour and us giving some attitude to the waiter, the condescending manager came over to explain there was an \"issue\" in the kitchen... If that was the case they could have explained that much sooner.  We also noticed a couple walk out due to the slow service.  The food came out and absolutely not worth the wait.  Over TWO hours later, at the end of our meal, the manager offered to give us a free glass of champagne, to which we declined.  He kept offering free stuff, not worth it.  Eventually he gave us a mediocre discount... Horrible experience.  It may be nicely decorated, but management, wait staff and quality of food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to other Symposiums before, nothing to write home about but I've never had a bad experience either. Till this time.   We happened to be in this area later in the day on Saturday so popped in for dinner. Our server, Lindsay, was either new or just not very bright.  We ordered a pitcher of mojitos and she brought us out two glasses of red wine - we sent them back and again explained that we wanted the mojito pitcher. This time she came back with a pitcher of sangria....WTF?? We kept the sangria because it was just getting a little silly to keep explaining to her what a mojito was.   I ordered the almond topped tilapia with rice and veggies and my friend had the Jack Daniels steak....by itself. They didn't put the sides on the plate when they brought out the steak. So the sides, mashed potatoes and veggies, came after and were stone cold so they had to be sent back to be warmed.   Oh, and the highlight of the meal - I got food poisoning and have spent the last two days being totally sick.  Skip this place!"}
{"text":"I usually don't give out 5 star reviews unless I am super satisfied by all aspects of a restaurant, either service or food. I was served by a new server named \"MELISSA\". Although she was new but she showed interest in her job and was a sincere hostess. Usually they are nice just to be tipped! Great experience, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been twice for breakfast, once for appetizers and drinks,  and twice for supper.  The atmosphere is great and that's about it. Servers follow the same script as servers at Montanas (meaning they will barge into your conversation to ask if everything is ok). The food is passable but nothing great. And they seem to want to rush you out.  Overall, another mediocre restaurant for Ajax."}
{"text":"Good ambiance great service unfortunately food was just ok. Bit of a draft close to the window. Will go back but definitely missing the wow factor."}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated restaurant. Good service and good menu, nice patio. I like here for breakfast or coffee with dessert. Very resonable and lots of special."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Symposium. I had heard about it from a family member, so I decided to try it for lunch with a large group. Myself, as well as the other members of my table were unsatisfied with our meals.  Several of us ordered sandwiches, the turkey seemed like cold cut meat and ALL of the tomatoes given were the ends. Also, the fries were either soggy or over done. The other meals were okay, but nothing to write home about. I will definitely not be visiting again for lunch.   However, the desserts were quite good. This restaurant is better suited as a cafe and dessert type place. The service was okay, but could have been better as the restaurant was quite empty, but the food took quite a while to come out. The menu is WAY too large and overpriced for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Terrible service, I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it has been consistently poor. I see staff standing around talking while the customers are waiting for service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"3.5/5~ This is a nice restaurant to go to with a few friends and chat over a meal or dessert. I have been to the location in Aurora and I would say the waiters here are much more friendly and helpful. Chris was my waiter tonight. He was super nice and was helpful with the menu options.   Tonight I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with a side of caesar salad. The pork was so delicious! The flavor and seasoning was just perfect and it was so juicy. The ciabatta bun was perfectly toasted. Soft and crispy on the edges, not too tough ir chewy. The caesar salad had too much dressing on it. I think they forgot to serve the coleslaw that was supposed to come with my order but didn't bother to ask.   Ordered the East Meets West waffle dessert to share with my two friends. It is their \"classic favorite\" on the menu. Came with one scoop of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, whip cream, strawberries and bananas. Tasted fine, nothing special. I wish they would have put more ice cream though."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to try this restaurant after hearing good reviews, mostly about that they have nice cakes. Finally had a chance to visit today for lunch. First thing I noticed was how nice the patio looked. Too bad it was too cold today though. The interior was also very nice. Very big open space and the bar/drinks area was nicely decorated and felt comfortable.   The menu had a good variety and breakfast is served until 4pm. I ordered the Eggs Benjamin since I love my smoked salmon. Service was good and quick. Good sized portions but the food wasn't great nor bad. Probably not something I would order again. My friend had ordered the pulled pork sandwich which he said was pretty good.   Would come back again and try other things on their menu. Nice place to just relax and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Nice to have something in the North end. Average food but better than the other chains, good drinks.  We usually get the same server Jason, he is great...when he isn't working and we don't have him the experience is not the same. Actually, it makes a huge difference overall. Some of the other servers are not as knowledgeable in the menu or do quality checks."}
{"text":"this place rebranded it self... it was purely a grab a drink/dessert type of place when it first came into the marketplace about 15 yrs  ago (kind of gave away my age there lol).  it has not evolved  into a dining type of restaurant, a little more sophistication.  we ordered the Greek chicken sandwich with Ceasar salad, steak wrap with fries and the 'east meet west' waffle for dessert.  the Greek chicken sandwich was pretty good, no complaints there.  however, the steak wrap should be renamed, it should be called veggie wrap with a little steak in it.  place was a bit dark, but I swear, I did not see more than 2 little pieces of steak in the wrap.  every bite was pure veggies.  it was good but way short on the meat.  the fries needs a little help.  the style was like New York Fries but minus the crunch.  it was too soft for my liking.  in terms of size, we eat both meals in a shorter time span than it took to bring it out to us.  that should give you an idea of the portion size.    now for the dessert.  it was basically vanilla and chocolate ice cream on a waffle with bananas  and strawberries.  this was petty big.  I actually did not finish this plate off and I usually  finish everything.  but keep in mind, you have to consider what I eat during the day.  lol... let's not get into that.    price wise, I guess it's pretty average for this type of restaurant.  each sandwich was about $12 and dessert was $11.    will I come back... hard to say.  undecided at this moment.  I'm leaning towards coming back, the food was pretty good in a way.  it was just not the right time tonight.  I was too hungry to eat in a place like that... buffet would've  been more ideal."}
{"text":"We went there recently for a casual dinner and were quite disappointed. Both the souvlaki and club sandwich came in dry buns....so weird...so bland and the chicken parm was salty. During our dinner the manager went to the next table because the lady's chicken was also too salty. Our desserts were good so we would only go back for dessert. Service was also not good at all."}
{"text":"Great! Good prices, fast friendly service, super cute waiter =) , great atmosphere and delicious breakfast food. Had the $5 mimosa"}
{"text":"Perfecto all together!! From variety of choices to service and atmosphere ... Everything is great and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food was yummy!! We got a pitcher of white wine sangria for $13.99 which was great too.. If u like pineapple. Steak sandwich wS a little fatty but had good flavour. Onion rings were perfect. Service was ok. A little too much personal tlk between staff. Didn't bug me too much tho; ill def go back ."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Symposium chain often eating at Woodbridge location so when learned of this location i went... First impression is great... but it ended there... 15 minutes to get menus and place our order.. there was 3. of us... then 40 mins to get the food but had to ask how much longer....   i should have cut my losses at that point... the food was honestly the worst dining experience ever.... my daughter's hamburg was so salty she could not eat more than 3 bites... my sons chicken fingers were terrible... on the third piece he actually spit it out....i had fried eggs and ham... the ham was uneatable with a bizarre taste.. it had been fried with something else... not sure.. just left it...  sad to say overall a terrible experience... because I'm a Symposium fan....  they need step it up..."}
{"text":"It's kind of a bar...a cafe...a restaurant. Which is not bad, but doesn't really specialize in anything. I go there because it's close, I've never had a bad experience and have never had something I didn't like. For a special occassion...it's not the best place, but for a normal wednesday girls night or a chilled weekend then it's ok."}
{"text":"Long wait, subpar food, small portions.  That pretty much sums this place up. If you're ever dragged here, be sure to eat beforehand.   We were a table of 6 for Sunday lunch. After we ordered we saw multiple tables come in, order, eat, and leave before our food even arrived. No apologies from the staff, and only acknowledged after we mentioned it. The food itself was severely disappointing. A chicken souvlaki sandwich for $12.95 came with a pitiful 3 small chunks of chicken, and took almost 50 minutes since ordering. On the plus side, the small portion prevented me from wasting food because I would only eat enough to not be starving.  I live nearby and I'm begging you not to dine here. If they go out of business maybe something decent will take its place.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Symposium is great addition to the town of Stouffville. We visit this restaurant periodically with family and have always been very happy with the service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited the place for a small lunch with a friend. The decor and interior look very nice indeed. Comfortable seating is ample.   I ordered the steak house salad. The steak was perfect. Not too raw but not overlooked and was very tender.   My friend got the chicken Parmesan pasta. Huge portion and taste was descent.   Service was pretty good, but I ordered coffee after food and it was kind of cold..  Overall, nice place, amazing specials and lots to choose from (all day breakfast, cocktails, food, desserts and more)...  The service, however, is not the greatest. They usually forget what you ask them and are not very attentive, but the menu has a lot of variety and serves every need.."}
{"text":"I've only been on Mondays when their burgers are $5.   The first time, was a few years back; the 2nd time was last year.   The waitress put a bottle of ketchup on the table; never asked if I wanted mustard or bbq sauce; I don't use ketchup at all, so I was quite disgusted that she never thought to ask if I wanted other condiments.  No lettuce or tomato either.   And the worst part was that there was  chunk of bone in the meat.    I told her, she never apologized; she told the manager.  Nothing was done so I complained via email to the restaurant.  The owner/manager sent me a $25 gift card and apologized for the way I was treated and was to speak with the staff.   I used that gift card to  treat my daughter for dinner.  Their food does not impress me at all.   I haven't tried anything but the burgers.  Not planning on returning.   Maybe Bolton is better; but I have a bad taste in my mouth for Symposium"}
{"text":"I've only been there for breakfasts, and there is always excellent service in the mornings and great food! I am usually greeted by an older gentleman who is very friendly. The price is cheap considering it's on Yonge Street.  great food and big portions. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Brunches here are the best..Smoked salmon and eggs Benny is my fave and i get it every time..cakes are also normally great but last time the carrot cake tasted very stale like it had been sitting for weeks..venue is nice and clean and overall recommend.."}
{"text":"Waitress very friendly. Atmosphere is awesome, something you can't find at The Keg! Manager knows how to run this place! Food was good, only tip I would give is more flavor on the jerk chicken sandwich. There was the kick but not enough jerk flavor. Also the Mocha cake was a little dry. All that aside, I would still strongly recommend this place and will visit again! Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location on Uppermiddle road, now under new owners this review is because this chain is trying to be everything to every customer , but not achieving it. They want to be a couples date night, after work drink spot, sports bar, family restaurant. However falls short on all. I'll elaborate on the sport bar comment, to make my point . They have 3 large TV's at the bar that is open to the whole restaurant ( great ambiance  ) that's an aside.  The 3 TV's all HAVE to be showing Sports , found out that a head office requirement, but wait for it... They are not aloud to put the sound on. Can you really watch your favorite team and not make a sound!  It makes no sense , either take away the TV's, or decide after a certain time you can put the sound on , let's face it , it's not family dining restaurant until 12 midnight!"}
{"text":"Symposim is a lot like the café mirage.symposium is a great place for breakfast but let me warn you they have so much trouble in the accuracy of my order I almost don't wanna go back.Even though I like their breakfast/Brunch.I don't recommend  Going at dinner or lunch because the food slides down.doiring dinner and sometimes lunch everyday they have specials that have not very good food for a decent price.Their accuracy is bad I ordered a kids menu for my nephew and here's what happens he ordered eggs and bacon meal which came with potato,eggs,bread and bacon and a drink and a desert  My nephew said over easy they made it overheard there was no bacon on the plate and when my niece ordered a \"freshly squeezed juice\" it was bitter and had chunks or orange peal not even zest!! When we sent their \"freshly squeezed juice\" back the waiter claimed it  was from yesterday .after sending that back my niece ordered a mango juice (blended with ice extra charge) and guess what it wasn't sweet soooo we sent that back for a mango juice without ice the last one was fine.on the bill they charged us for the mango juice we sent back which was more expensive . Right before leaving I realized my niece and nephew didn't receive a desert  The desert thing has happend so many times"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service I have ever had. Food was garbage. I will never come back here. Manager is a dick, makes jokes about how we got our water after waiting 20 minutes (for water). Didn't get a menu until I had to stand up and get one myself. Server arrived at our table after sitting down for 20 minutes. Absolute shithole. Came for the Caesars, awful as well - did not put any alcohol and charged. Waited an additional 20 minutes for our bill. A 30 minute breakfast took an hour and a half. Do not come here. I never go on yelp and review, this is my first one ever. I feel obligated to let everyone know that they should absolutely never come here."}
{"text":"What's not to like.  Amazing ambiance.  Friendly staff.  Great food.  I used to go there for desserts but saw others ordering entrees with big portion sizes.  So I took the kids there for a meal.  Their pizza is amazing.. Calamari is fried but better than Red Lobster... Chicken tenders are to die for...best in town.  Mushroom cheese burger is out of this world.  Fries are excellent."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for about a year now because that is how good the food and service was at Symposium Cafe. We went there for a breakfast date and the food and service were great. The staff were extra nice and went the extra mile to accommodated us. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was really good. Came with roast potatoes which were really dry  -- try the chocolate cookie sundae! Has a lava surprise :)"}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is lovely. I had pasta in a rose sauce and it was pretty good. It would have been a great evening, but for the table of 4 sitting behind us who all lit up disgusting cigars.  Our server was great, but only managed to get 2 extinguished.  They smoked for a good 2 hours. It's one thing to taste someone's cigarette smoke when I'm eating, it's another when it's cigar smoke.  The manager was completely unsympathetic.  Sorry guys, you lost us. Table of 5, we all live in the area, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Burnt and dry burgers but they changed it right away, tastes bland tho. The deserts were great as expected and great staff!"}
{"text":"What a deal  Burgers  for 4 bucks. Great soup & burgers. Pabst beer for 4 as well.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I like this location but they can't seem to get the side of fruit right.  I got the Belgian waffles with a side of fruit and breakfast fries.. The fruit always looks cheap and left over from the previous guest.  The breakfast fries keeps me coming back , they are so GOOD!!! The servers are always nice!"}
{"text":"I  visited the place recently. Love the renaissance style deco,  fairly impressed by the bar. It has good potential for late night hangouts.  The owner(s) are pretty nice, it looks like the restuarant was run by a family. I was greeted right away and took to my seat. From their menu and from previous reviews, it sounds like their early bird breakfest menu has their signature dishes. Wouldn't mind ordering that, but I came in at around 3pm.  The pulled pork sandwich I ordered was really nicely done, the bread was crispy, egg was cooked, meat sauce was rich yet it wasn't soaking the bread , unlike some greasy soggy meals from some Toronto downtown food joints. (which was where I spend most of my lunch time)   There were a lot of parking space, the restaurant is accessible to drivers. Overall I am pretty happy with the place, the cakes looked pretty delicious too, but I was only makeing a quick stop, I might try some next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in the area and eat out a lot so we found this place driving around searching Yelp for somewhere out of our usual places.  I like coming here for the 2 for 1 cakes I. Sundays and I recommend the mocha with it.   I also love doing breakfast here, we are veggies so he loves to have eggs over easy with hash-browns but I come for the Tuscan Benedict. It's got tomatoes and asparagus and the sauce isn't too heavy and 3 poached eggs!  They also do a beer and burger on Mondays, good deal and the veggie burger is good.  There is also a night that they have pasta and wine is $4 off!   We like the service it's way better than the Yonge St location. Julian has been my server a few times, he's great!"}
{"text":"Although the speed is not the quickest, the staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is very enjoyable"}
{"text":"So I came here for a first date who proposed coffees. Whatever, I thought, we can grab some dessert and as the night goes on, more food if need be. The place seemed perfect for this.  The staff are fantastic. We came in before the dinner rush, so the waiter spent a lot of time on us explaining pretty much everything they had. After a lot of deliberation we decided to split the Taboo cake (come on, on a date, this is a clear choice!!!).  This place seems swanky, so I expected a small piece of something on a huge plate.  Wrong.  The slice we got seemed like it could be a small cake in itself. I honestly don't know how we finished it, but any ideas of dinner that I had before vanished into thin air.   We stayed for hours and eventually the staff got the message and stopped bugging us which I much appreciated!!!   The atmosphere is great, lounge-ish with some quiet music and conducive to conversation.   Overall I'd highly recommend this place. This is a chain so you can expect a similar level of quality if you've been to one of these before. Prices are very reasonable compared to similar places in TO."}
{"text":"Ordered the Monday special which was a big burger for $4. It was decent and came with lettuce, tomato, pickles. Everything else was extra $ (including the cheese).   The sweet potato fries were a side but we had the pay for that separately ($4.95 if memory serves me correctly). Surprisingly these did not taste good. They were soggy and tasted kind of stale. The basil mayo was awesome though  My friend got a berry smoothie which she enjoyed and i got an iced mochacino which again tasted very average (i'd take the tim hortons ice capp over this drink).   Finally the service was friendly but extremely slow considering the sheer number of staff i saw in the front of the house. The kitchen took well over 40mins to get my burger out and the meat didn't taste like it was freshly grilled or anything. We called ahead to confirm if there was working fast WiFi, but when we arrived they said it was down (felt misled by the staff on this point)  I probably would only come back for desserts as they appeared to be standard cakes and pies from the market. The rest of the food and beverages really are forgettable"}
{"text":"I was in last Sunday and was severely disappointed at the lack of service. I'd been to Symposium a couple times before and had a good time. Last Sunday, my family and I walked in to eat brunch... Only to be sat in the furthest and darkest corner of the restaurant, and was left waiting for 10 minutes before we finally decided to get up and leave. A gentleman who looked like he was the manager sat us, and left us to wait. No glasses of water, not even a simple \"your server will be with you shortly\" to let us know that we would be taken care of. When we decided to leave, my sister had talked to the manager and complained about the lack of service. He repeatedly told her that \"someone was coming\" but it was too late. We were too frustrated to even stay, not to mention we had a toddler with us who needed eat right away, and we didn't feel like sitting around for another 20 minutes waiting. Oh, and did I mention we were one of the first few guests in that morning? There was one other table sat, so lack of service is completely inexcusable."}
{"text":"We were there for brunch on Sunday. It was fairly busy. We were seated within 5 minutes of being there. Were given a booth. Asked if we would like any drinks to start off with. We asked for two waters and an orange juice. The waitress came back in 5 minutes with our drinks but just one glass of water. We then waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our order. Ordered - Egg Florentine, cheese and veggie omelette and a side order of french toast. The food was just ordinary. Under seasoned and just plain. Also the side pf home fries were very little which was disappointing because that was the only thing that was good. Don't think we'll go back for brunch here."}
{"text":"First time here and I found the food and service excellent.   I ordered tomato soup with grilled chicken wrap.  Quite tasty!!  Caters to everyone from food(salad, vegetarian, steak and chicken), drinks (alcohol and non alcoholic  )coffee, tea and dessert.  Arrived around 9:00 pm on Friday and it was pretty busy but we had no problem finding a seat with a party of 3.  It got busy later in the evening with maybe 10 people waiting.  I forgot the waiters name but thank you for the wonderful experience ."}
{"text":"I've been here before and it's been good to not so good at times. Took my daughter for lunch and it was OK. Service was good. Food was what brought the rating down. I had the fish and chips. Fish was OK, but the portions were really small. I don't mind paying a little more if I feel satisfied after eating. But I didn't. I can never figure out why on earth a business would skimp on something so inexpensive as fries. A good portion of fries can go an awful long way to satisfy. I could have held them in the palm of my hand. Maybe 15 frozen fries. Makes no sense to me. There are other places in town who for a couple more dollars, serve halibut, fresh cut fries  and half a plate of them at that. Not sure how long it will be before I give it another try, My advice for them is, you can afford another $.20 on fries to make a customer happy and want to come back. Think I'll stick to my usual."}
{"text":"Delicious Beef Burger in Town! Yum! It also provides a nice environment with comfortable seating, indoor and outdoor. Great selection of wines and a wide variety of dishes.  Monday Special with Great Price! Must Go & Eat!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The dessert we ordered was way beyond sweet, took one bite and I was done. The freshly squeezed juices were pretty much served in a shot glass. I took one sip and I was done, literally. Their breakfast was also disappointing, it was bland and everything was just dry. The bill also took a really long time. I will give points for decor and patio though."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is 'meh'.  Not terrible, but definitely not good.  It's like a great idea, poorly executed.  You'd be better off to visit an actual greasy spoon if you want breakfast, or an actual italian restaurant if you want pasta.  I mean geez, it's Woodbridge - you can't throw a stone without finding a place that makes a top notch pizza or pasta dish.  This is not one of those places, though."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this Resturant Service was amazing and kind and the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"We went for a late night snack after 9pm on a weeknight. They had a nice patio, half with dining tables and chairs, the other half had lounge sets. Unfortunately, my other half is sensitive to mosquito bites so we opted to sit indoors.  The environment is quiet and comfortable.   Service was good since the place wasn't busy. We had cakes and a Cajun shrimp appetizer. I thought the shrimps were the big ones but they turned out to be the small 'popcorn shrimp' type. The cakes are consistent in quality with those from the Markham store - looks better than it tastes, IMO.   I think this is the best place in Stouffville to have a coffee and dessert. It stays open till 1am Sun -Thurs, 2am Sat & Sun (but will close earlier if there are no customers.) Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Three of us tried to have breakfast there this past Sunday morning.  Sat down at any empty (dirty) table on the front patio.  Menus arrived immediately, but no one came back to clean the table, to bring water, to offer coffee, or to take orders for over a half hour (no exaggeration).  As we sat and waited, waited, waited, we couldn't help noticing how noisy the patio is, what with the subway grate in the floor, Yonge Street traffic, etc.  We eventually got up and walked out (unnoticed) and went to the Aroma Café across the street.  There we had a great breakfast and got home before dark."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place the other day in Oak Ridges. It is located in the same plaza as the newly opened Food Basic. The decoration was specular and very upscale. The service was great as well. We went here for drinks on a weekday. I order a Gin and Tonic ($5.95) and my friend order the Symposium caffe latte (~$4.00). The caffee latte was like a dessert with cream on top, but it did get really sweet towards the end. My GT could use a little more gin, but it was a good sized portion for the price.  They do have daily specials as well and a spacious patio outside, but unfortunately it was too cold and windy to sit outside. Considering its proximity to my neighbourhood, I'm pretty sure I will be a frequent here."}
{"text":"Disappointed.   Service: Inattentive server and slow to take order and bring meals   Food: Overcooked and burnt steak on Steak Sandwich; Drenched Pesto spread on Pesto Chicken Sandwich (soggy and overpowering); Delicious Ice Cream Sandwich (light, fluffy and fresh)  Overall unpleasant dining experience"}
{"text":"This place has potential. The decor inside is cute and comfortable. The menu seems appetizing, with reasonable portions. However, the service could really use some improvement. The serving staff seemed disorganized. After ordering, we waited. And waited. And waited........... A couple that arrived 10 minutes was served first and received their food in half the time. Food preparation was clearly very slow, and by the time my chicken & parmesan sandwich arrived, the the fries had already gone soft and the cheese had set. I'm a bit picky about the textures in my food, so the mushy, oil-soaked bottom bun grossed me out. Clearly it had been sitting out for too long. Why didn't the just give me my food as soon as it was prepared? My friend's dessert was fabulous though. Plating was beautiful with huge portions of delicious waffles and ice cream and caramel brownies and whipped cream. Wow.  Overall, taste was okay but not worth the 40-minute long wait. If desserts are your thing, you may want to give Symposium a shot. If you want a quick & tasty meal, skip Symposium and head to the Tim Horton's next door."}
{"text":"heard good things about this restaurant  through family and friends and they were 100% right . The service was amazing , our server Caleb was very friendly knowledgeable and attentative. The food was reasonably priced with big portion sizes and it was so delicious ! I woukd highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came here once, sat down orderd drinks, looked at the menu , the prices were out of this world, so drank up and went to The George Pub, where the food is great, patio is great and the prices are great too!!!!!!."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time. The portion sizes weren't bad.   The burger was good. Club sandwich is typical.  Kids meals size was great and has a decent variety. It wasn't just cheese sandwich, chicken fingers and hot dog like a lot of places."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot! Had a nice Breakfast today with my family.  Pros: Liked their Latte, Veg. Omelette, Potatoes.  Cons: They don't have Pancakes :("}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! Everything I have eaten on the menu has been great! Seafood pasta and the mussels were amazing. Great service, very friendly staff!! I have never had to wait long for my food. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. Awesome desserts as well and on Sundays 2 for 1 desserts!! All items are very reasonably-priced for the quality of the food you get."}
{"text":"Gone downhill since it opened. I use to come here weekly with friends but the service has gotten inconsistent and slow.  The food quality has also gone downhill and the portions are small and  inconsistent. The breakfasts use to be great but no longer. I went last month with friends and one dish came out with a feather stuck in the potatoes.   The response we got was an \"oops\". When her corrected dish finally came out of the kitchen the rest of us were finished. No compensation  and no comment from manager just handed her the bill.   It is expensive and as the prices go up the food goes down.  It is a shame because the atmosphere is really great and they have an excellent patio."}
{"text":"We went there for a family dinner, the greeter (also manager?) was less than pleasant, verging on rude, and the service was very slow. We were hoping to order dessert but ended up not doing so due to the extraordinary long wait times for our food and waiter to come around. No offer of refills or water.   I wouldn't bother to be honest."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. There are a lot of places that do then same concept. The customer service here could be better. Sometimes it doesn't seem like their servers care enough to check up on your table to make sure everything is okay. Their washroom is clean. The decor is very cozy. Their food...I am not sure cause I have never tried it.  I only come here for dessert. I have an obsession with Carrot Cake and their sky high Carrot Cake is amazing. The cream cheese frosting is creamy, buttery and just sweet enough. The cake is moist and fluffy with a few fruits tossed in there to provide contrast of texture and taste to the cream cheese frosting. Every time I come here I get the Carrot Cake (unless they don't have it than I have to, reluctantly and painfully, choose a different dessert).   Please keep in mind that there are always a good amount of people enjoying themselves at this location. I see that these people do order their food and seem to enjoy it. I also have noticed that they have many good deals such as date night for 2 for $48. Burgers for $5 as long as your purchase ANY drink. Their portions looks huge. Will he coming back here one day for a meal. :)"}
{"text":"I thought the atmosphere was really nice. The staff were very friendly and attentive until we paid the bill. Food came out a little quickly. She did ask was it ok, I figured it would get cold. The food was good. Nothing outstanding good. The wine was very nice. I like the pairing notes on the menu. Keep going with the wine list and you will have a nice little wine bar. We chatted for an hour after the bill was paid. No one came to ask if we want anything else. Lost opportunity. Not offended but might have been a good idea. Keep working on it and could easily be a five star."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The server that looks like Rihanna was extremely friendly/bubbly, helpful and very attentive. Went there for the first time to try their breakfast. Their standard breakfast is about $9 and includes coffee, you get quite a bit of food, (meat, potatoes, toast & 3 eggs) breakfast potatoes where perfectly seasoned as crispy! Server also mentioned they have $5 burgers & beers on Mondays and early bird dinner for only $15! Seems like they have pretty good deals/savings! Can't wait to go back again! Will definitely recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Extremely unimpressed! I wish I could give half a star, if even.  From the time we sat down to the time our food came was over an hour. The place didn't seem particularly busy. We tried to ask our server to follow up on our order and we were ignored. One of us had to get up twice to go and ask the staff at the kitchen to see if our order was placed. Server finally brought our food, along with her attitude - not impressed. There was no apology or explanation as to why it took so long. The staff here didn't seem to want to help us.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"Over priced food with extremely bad service. Perfect combination for a successful business! Owner/manager must be loaded because they sure don't care about their customers.  Will not go back even if they are giving away free food. Stay away"}
{"text":"Supervisor is terrible.  Looks like a dirty stripper however,  I don't even want to deal with her.  I'll never go back and you lost a gentleman."}
{"text":"I found this place after Googling good places for breakfast/brunch to enjoy on my birthday.  I was not disappointed at all.    We got there at 9am on a Tuesday, so there was only one other table when we arrived.  The place looks nice and well kept.  The chairs are comfortable, though if you're not very tall, it can feel like you're sitting a little low at the table, but it wasn't so noticeable that it made it uncomfortable to eat.  They also have a large wrap-around patio that looks like it would be great for a Sunday morning brunch, I can't wait to test that out when the weather permits!  My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of bacon and I got the Eggs Florentine.  Amazing!  Even though we were one of two tables in the place, we were pleasantly surprised with how quickly our order came out after placing it.  Each plate came with three poached eggs.  We both like our eggs soft and they were cooked beautifully!  The English muffins we fresh and warmed perfectly.  The pea-meal bacon on my husbands Benny was fresh and perfectly cooked, nice and tender, not rubbery like it can get when it's overcooked or not fresh.  The spinach on my was tender but not soggy, it still had a good texture to it.  The Hollandaise sauce was delish!  And, the bacon was perfectly crispy, but not burnt.  The potatoes that came with the dishes were so yummy!  Perfectly cooked to a crisp outside with a tender inside and deliciously seasoned!  I normally don't eat potatoes but I finished every things on my plate!  We took a look at the dinner menu while we were there, it looks like the dishes might be a little dated, but given the very European area we are in it probably works well with their clientele.  That being said, we are looking forward to trying them for dinner given how wonderfully cooked and fresh breakfast was!  If you're in the area and looking for a nice place to Brunch, I would highly recommend Symposium Cafe."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch over the holidays on a weekday, and I would have to say for a quiet day our service was not very good at all. The staff didn't seem to pay much attention to the customers and they were chatting amongst themselves more. When they did come to serve us, they didn't seem overly happy about it. Anyways,  aside from the service, I had the eggs benedict and it was good, aside from the fact the knives they give you are so dull you can barely cut anything with it. My husband had the big breakfast, and in comparison to many other restaurants I think the portion is smaller than what you'd expect for the price. I think I'd go there for burgers and something else if I was to return."}
{"text":"Symposium is one of my fav places for lunch or a light snack. I just love their steaks and burgers!! The serving size is amazing and a great value for money   Be it a rendezvous with my friends or a business lunch, for me, it's symposium all the way!"}
{"text":"we came here for mothers day. it was super busy and we have to wait around 30-45 minutes for our food to arrive. i dont blame them because of how busy it was. our breakfast was exactly the way we wanted. everything was great."}
{"text":"As a whole the food is very good however the last two times that we have gone to this restaurant one person in the party has found that their food wasn't the best. we had ordered an omelette and the omelette was very dry and then the cheese inside wasn't even melted so it made for a lukewarm omelette. also another time we had ordered eggs Benedict poached medium eggs came poached heard which wasn't very appetizing. other than that the service was very quick and the staff were very friendly and took our complaints seriously and fixed it right away which was really good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever experienced! Waited over an hour, no one checked on us, never received food, other tables offered waffles on the house but our family wasn't. Father's Day and way understaffed. Manager shouldn't be a manager! All he said was sorry, didn't offer to see where our food was, no offer of complimentary waffles. Table behind us had two orders of the comp waffles. While we didn't even get drink refills. Still in shock that a manager can be that incompetent and not try to resolve situation. He could care less that we left."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Nice homey feel with lots of booths and a nice patio outside. Breakfast was delicious and not expensive. Hubby had a breakfast sandwich (was filling and you don't need a side) and I had the western and cheddar omelette. Big portions and really filling. Great potatoes on the side. Service was excellent. Will definitely be back to try lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"3.5  The portions are big, the food is good.  The service is friendly, but slow. Maybe it's the time that I've gone (mid-afternoon 2pm-ish) that it's like that. There aren't as many people working at that time, so it take a little while. But the times that I've gone, the food takes forever. Forever and ever.  They have a daily deals if you're into that kind of stuff."}
{"text":"Planned to come here for a girls night out as it was a convenient location for our group.  There was lots of space when we arrived and we were seated quite quickly.  The waiter kept referring to me a \"doll\".  Not sure I found it cute at all.  Overall the food is very overpriced for what you get.  We ordered desserts and can't say we were super impressed.  The waitstaff brought water at the beginning when we were seated.  After our food and drinks were delivered we never saw them again.  No one checked in to see if we wanted to order more. No one refilled water glasses.  Service was very poor."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends.  We were there for Mussels and Martini night and had both.  Both were yummy.  Service was great - attentive but not too intrusive.  I would definately go back."}
{"text":"Lots of new development in Ajax and it seems most food establishments are setting up shop in these suburban retail plazas. We have our son enrolled in the Northern Karate martial arts program and thought it might be nice to visit the swanky Symposium Cafe next door for some breakfast. Ordered the Children's breakfast: the French toast was burnt on the side facing up on plate. My son did not eat any... cannot really blame him....... I did mention this to our server but she failed to provide any solution. Clean your grills........The single sliced strawberry and a cube of browned banana hardly provided any punch to the kids meal. The cheese & ham omelet was below average on taste and was served cold. A meager portion of frozen, then, deep fried home fries were somewhat tasty and enjoyed by the wife. I ordered the Cuban Breakfast sandwich that was rather tasty.  Upon receiving the bill I did notice a discrepancy in coffee pricing........$2.95 for house coffee and &1.95 for the House coffee. WTF!!!! I asked the nearest server why the difference in coffee pricing and her response was an unsure, \" I just started working here, you can ask the guy in the blue Shirt\". I then directed my coffee query to the blue shirted manager who pulled out a huge menu and showed me the gourmet coffee price that was $2.95 but a coffee purchased with breakfast was just $1.95????? Not that I wanted a quarrel over coffee pricing but it is one of my biggest disappointments about the food industry when items are over charged(seriously, unit cost on a cup of coffee is at best .25 to .32 cents..) Just keep coffee at one price and avoid the confusion.  Location was clean and nicely decorated, however, staff needs to be fully trained on all aspects of restaurant procedures and pricing. Try serving food that is not burnt. Instead of trying to promote all the upcoming weekly specials, focus on keeping your customers happy and stop with the coffee price fixing.. At best, your establishment scores a 2.5 out of 5......."}
{"text":"Had the chicken souvlaki wrap with a Greek salad. After eating the first half and into my first bite of the second half I saw that piece of chicken was not fully cooked. Not pink, red. I showed my server and asked her to show her chef. She offered to make another half or get me something else to eat, but I couldn't wait.   We received our bill with no discount or comp. I asked the waitress for a discount or to comp my meal, she went back to her manager. He gave me $3.25 off my $40 bill.   No apology, risk of FOOD POISONING and I left hungry. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POORLY MANAGED RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Sunday night, the place had a scattering of people around.  our waitress was very polite, nice, friendly and patient with us, as we kept having her come back to get our order since my guest and I were too busy chit chatting to look at the menu.  Shared the chicken thai tenders for an appetizer and ate the chicken stir fry for dinner. Both were pretty tasty. Cost me about $30 with no drink.  I would definitely go back. lots of good choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. Both times I've been here the waiters acted like a deer caught in headlights when I had something to say about the food..:/didn't offer anything extra. Just a simple I'm sorry.. Nothing special about the food. Ordinary presentation."}
{"text":"Want a generous serving of pork sushi served a la parasites style?   Having tried their dessert menu a week prior, I decided to bring my friends for a birthday celebration to try their dinner menu. We were seated promptly, everything was going well until my friend realized the last two pieces of her pork tenderloin was bright pink on the inside. We flagged the waiter down and he was very apologetic and took the plate away (hence we didn't take a picture). The manager, Peter, came to talk with us. In a normal situation, the manager should apologize and offer solutions. However, Peter was very defensive, challenged our food safety knowledge (FYI according to Health Canada pork should be cooked to internal temperature of 71C), the bright pink colour was definitely NOT up to par. He kept insisting because past customers didn't like well done pork so they serve theirs medium-rare. Being in the food service industry myself, I have never heard of any establishments that serves medium rare pork to cater to their customers (71C is medium). At the end, he comp us a slice of cake and 25% off the pork entree. As a newly opened franchise restaurant, the manager did not show any remorse nor service recovery. Before we left, Peter found out that we were celebrating a birthday and insisted that he shouldn't have acted like he did because it was a celebration. Well isn't that a tad too late? We will not go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place again since I was in the neighbourhood, and the food was just how I remembered it... BLAH.  On Saturday they advertise their special - $18.95 for an appetizer platter. I chose the calamari and fire cracker shrimp flatbread.  Literally I got a handful of calamari rings. I, however, cannot complain about the size of the flatbread. It was still small but for 1/2 of the appetizer platter thats under 19 bucks it was ok.   Calamari was good. Nothing special, but you can't really mess up calamari. Or can you..?  The fire cracker flatbread on the other hand was unbearable. I'm sure it would have tasted great IF MY TASTEBUDS WEREN'T ON FIRE!! My god I felt like they used pure hot sauce instead of tomato sauce.  All in all, you can get much better at a chain restaurant like Moxies or Milestones.  Interior is nice though. A- for that!"}
{"text":"My go to place for just hanging out and having a meal with a friend. I do live close by. Decent meals w. decent service and decent prices."}
{"text":"Took my kids here on a Thursday night. I had the Chicken Parmesan and the kids each had a kid's meal that was basically pasta with cream or tomato sauce accompanied by a drink and dessert. The portion sizes were very good for the price but the food seemed quite bland. The highlight of the night, for my kids, is the hot fudge brownie with ice cream. Also, it seems like their ownership and staff have changed as well as the service was quite slow; from ordering to collecting our plates to getting our bill. Not sure if I'll be back since I can make the hot fudge brownie at home for my kids. Don't think I'll be rushing back here just for dessert and considering that there are so many other options in the Markham area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Symposium a few times and it is just ok. We have been for breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is mediocre. There are not a lot of patios in Georgetown, so this is a nice place to have a drink outside. They have specials every day, which is nice. Service is pretty good, but there are a couple of servers that are very obnoxious and loud, which works on the patio, but not inside during dinner service. We will go back because as another poster said, there is not a lot of choice in Georgetown, but if there was a better option we would not go here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a nice surprise! The food is quality, and their menu has a huge selection. Their breakfast choices are super yummy - nice atmosphere, really good service.   Their cakes are delicious as well.  Thumbs up - try it out."}
{"text":"I had dinner last week with my husband at this restaurant. We had the Thursday special. Both of us got a soup, choice of 3 mains, shared dessert(it was a huge piece of carrot cake) and 2 cafe lattes for $44.00. The food was delicious and our waiter was great. We really enjoyed our dinner. We will be back, although the patio is a little noisy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Comfortable setting adds up to overall experience. Very good selection. Price are on a tad bit higher side. It would be great to repeat the same seating arrangement that they have by the windows, also in the middle (Whenever they renovate). Best veg soup!! Not many restaurants offer delicious veg soups & items. Quantity of food is also very good! Looking forward to see more seating & more selection in future!!! Especially in kids menu."}
{"text":"I like to eat here in the summer and sit out on the patio. The servers are very friendly. The fries come with basil mayo. They have daily specials, it's always a nice surprise when they have 2 for 1 cake. I love having the cake and coffee, cap or latte.  Sometimes they have great off-menu specials, like baked fish with mango salsa. It's a nice spot for a casual date or catch-up with friends."}
{"text":"Love love love the decor & ambiance....the burgers & onion rings are too die for & i am not kidding!!! On Mon nights beer & burgers are both $3.75 & the burgers are big fat & extra juicy. The music is light & easy listening & staff are ultra friendly, altho a little slow at times. Great job Symposium & see ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Symposium with my family today for dinner and our server Olek was wonderful. He checked up on our table many times and he was very attentive. The manager came by and checked up on the table to make sure everything was okay. The portion sizes for the foods are unbelievable. I definitely recommend going to Symposium Cafe!!"}
{"text":"Me and my Fiance had heard a lot about this place and so we decided to give it a try. The decor and overall atmosphere of the cafe is more than we expected. Very different than most cafe's actually. The music is quite loud, so it's not necessarily good for a quiet or romantic date. It is however very uplifting and a nice change. The food on the other hand was horrible. We only ordered dessert and my fiance's cookie ice cream sandwich tasted like something cooked in the microwave! My cheesecake was ridiculously small and quite different than explained on the menu (the menu didn't have any visuals either, which I always see as a downside). I asked my server if I could exchange my dessert with something else and she was very hesitant even after I insisted it was stale (I've never had a problem else where). She asked me what I wanted without the menu and I decided for a icecream crepe off the top of my head. The crepe was just as horrible. It was ridiculously fried and the ice cream wasn't the greatest either. The brownies were literally covered in sugar and she didn't come back to check on us the whole night. We walked to the cash to pay. All in all, It's not somewhere I would recommend for dessert, but then again I am quite picky."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Symposium cafe at Stouffville and tried several items from the menu, all great, tasty, flavorful: particularly enjoyed the shrimp and calamari, all dishes are very well presented. Peach Martinis are to die for!!! I am not a martini girl in general but I gave them a try and they were awesome and not sweet (which is why I don't have them that often).  I really enjoyed the service as well, my friend and I sat on the patio (an usually patios don`t get fast service). This wasn't the case, our server was fast, made recommendations and asked how our food was. Also, the owners are usually there and they stop by to greet you, making you feel special.  Patio has some TV's, so it's a great place to watch a game or enjoy some drinks after work or with your friends. Parking is easy and convenient, in a plaza. Washrooms are small but impeccable and they smelled great (hard to say that about a washroom). This place is a great addition to this community!"}
{"text":"First time here and the experience wasn't too bad, we ordered a Jack Daniels Flat Iron steak with mashed potatoes, veggies. We asked for medium and it came out the cut of the steak was not good and dried and a bit overcooked.  But my friend still try her best to chew on it but had to throw out some, then one of staff came and asked if everything was OK, we honestly tell him.the steak was over cooked and dried. He said we will cook another plate for us and we should have told them and they would not let us suffer trying to chew the dry meat. He insisted he will have the chef to make another plate which came out perfect. We were very impressed with his attitude and friendly suggestion, he said he would rather see  us have a good experience than leaving the restaurant with a bad review and impressions. So overall I think.this restaurant worth a try and staff were totally friendly and polite."}
{"text":"This location is really disappointing. I feel like the kitchen staff is really uninspired, and they won't let you modify at breakfast. I gave it a lot of chances but I feel like the overall atmosphere is tacky and the food is just not good enough. Although the waffle ice cream sandwich is amazing. I've ordered a coffee off the menu before and no one knew how to make it. I feel like the owners opened a restaurant without any idea how to properly run one. I've just never had a good experience unfortunately."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today with friends for lunch.  The restaurant was maybe half full.  It took them 36 minutes to bring coffee.  We had to get up and ask for it and then it still took 10 more minutes. The food was fine.  Then when she cleared the plates she just never came back. After sitting there for 30 min I had to get up and find someone.  I spoke to the manager about the appalling service. He didn't care and didn't offer any compensation or apologies.   Finally after 40 min the Bills came and I demanded that the coffees be removed as we waited forever.  I won't be back.  Worst service ever."}
{"text":"This is our new favourite place. The service is great and the food is really good, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Ive had better and I've had worse. Came there once and tried the florentine mussels. Honestly thought they were sime of the best ive ever had, but every time since they were not even close in quality and taste. Once i even found a mussel full of dirt and i dont even know what else. The calamari is quite greasy as well. Their burgers and deserts are quite nice however. Seems ti be a hit and miss type of place."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday breakfast at around 12:30 pm.  The restaurant is not full and the service is very slow - no server in 10 mins.  We ordered from the breakfast menu.  My three eggs are done rubbery and I could do better myself at home. The rye bread toast came with dark burned marks and the server explained that has to do with the toaster and can't do anything about it.  The manager bring me some microwave warmed rye bread instead and it is terrible ! No offer of coupons or replacements."}
{"text":"Updated rating for listening to customer suggestion! The home fries are now fried separately from meat items.   Muslim sensitive*  Seating: This is a great place to go in the summer. My husband and I like to sit on the beautiful patio and there is always room for us. It's a good way to get away from the music they play indoors.  Breakfast: The omelettes are cooked in a separate pan, so no worry about the mixing of meat ingredients with a veggi order. I chose to rate it 3 stars instead of my original 4, because the seasoned fries (which we loved!) are cooked with other meat items.  Waffles are delicious. Coffee is great and bottomless, iced coffees and specialty coffees are something to be desired.   Service: Our server always checks on us, sometimes when it's busy they forget to bring us parts of our order and we wait to remind them. This has only happened 1 out of 5 times.   Over all good breakfast experience and we go often."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at fantastic prices. Amazing Service and Amazing staff Great setting, great everything,  I've only been once, but I can already say that we will be frequenting this spot as often as we can!"}
{"text":"Great service excellent atmosphere delicious food. Definitely recommended Ordered calamari, perfectly cook and good portion size for two people Great selection of wine. Pasta. Alfredo with salmon was delicious, and food was hot , tasted really good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! I went there for brunch with a friend, and had a pretty positive experience. The waitress did not seem like she knew the menu very well, but she was very friendly. The deluxe omelette was just okay, a bit overdone. However, the French Toast with Chantilly Cream and Crushed Oreos was really good. The bacon was burnt though, so make sure you ask them not to overcook them if you don't want charred bacon. I will definitely go back for drinks and another go for lunch or dinner. It definitely seems popular enough! The place was filling up for lunch on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Very inviting atmosphere. Love the happy hour discount on apps. The A/C could have been a little cooler, but the pepper steak fusilli was so good I forgot all about being too hot. Great meal!"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience , received a poor service from an unprofessional waiter.I personally will not go back to this place and will not recommend it to anyone. Awful,Awful,Awful."}
{"text":"Delicious!! We have never actually eaten food here but the dessert is amazing. We come every other Sunday for 2 for 1 cake slices and they don't disappoint. The specialty coffees and drinks are really good as well. No issues with the service either and the ambience is great as well. Definitely stop by if you are looking for dessert."}
{"text":"I've been coming here occasionally for breakfast on weekends over the past year or so, and I've yet to have a bad experience. It's nothing special or extraordinary, but Georgetown isn't exactly an epicure's paradise and given the choices in town it's generally pretty solid. The staff are nice and service is usually good, though the kitchen can be slow at times. If you're there for breakfast, try the Cuban sandwich, it's pretty unique and quite tasty. My girlfriend enjoys the caramel banana French toast. They also have good cakes and some pretty creative drinks. Overall, it's a decent place, won't rock your world but likely won't disappoint either."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 girlfriends to have brunch on a Sunday.  When I came in to get us seats, the restaurant seemed pretty full with young families.  Service was friendly and relatively quick AT THE START.    FOOD: We all ended up gets the eggs Benedict which was pretty standard, poached soft eggs were done right.  The waitress that was serving us advised us that coffee was included with our meals (we find out later that it is not). Shortly after finishing our meals, one of the staff members (not our original server?) lets us know that they were having a promo: cake was 2 slices for the price of 1.  This seemed like a great idea as there were 2 of us that recognized symposium as an awesome dessert place (Waterloo location).  We were sorely disappointed as the red velvet and brownie cake we had ordered turned out to be STALE.   At this point we were ready to pay and leave, but it took another 30-40 minutes and my girlfriend walking to the register to get their attention. This is the same time we find out that they charged us for the coffee.  Not looking to return to this place anytime soon and definitely not for their cake."}
{"text":"Great decor, good service BUT had better food: 1. Don't go for the orange banana strawberry fresh juice - in my humble opinion they don't mix 2. Eggs tried them different ways (Benedict, florentine and with asparagus) weren't any better or special than an eggsmart so why pay the extra  3. The calamari was extremely chewy and would come off the breading (some people like that I for one didn't)  What was good was the spinach dip and seafood pasta and I'm sure there might be other good dishes there."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with my bf.  It took quite a while for us to be seated while there were actually several empty tables with stuff on there that haven't been cleaned by the servers.  This place really needs to work on speeding up the process of cleaning tables and seating their customers.  Environment and seats were very comfortable, but there's a need for getting thicker blinds for the window by the booth seats for blocking the sun.  I ordered the Egg Neptune which was good except for the potatoes which were way too dried, and the dish portion was smaller comparing to Cora.  My bf had the Egg Florentine which was ok except for the smaller portion.  With better options out there, I may not come back again."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  When we walked in, there were plenty of seats available, but we still had to wait a few minutes before someone seated us. Once we sat down, we waited a good 10 minutes until our server came, and even though she was friendly, she always kept us waiting.  I ordered the deluxe omelette, and it was not the greatest. The egg was overcooked and the omelette was very dry.  Their marble rye bread is good, but it did not come with jam or anything.  I do not think I will come here again."}
{"text":"Amazing daily specials.  Burgers are my favourite!  They have updated their menu and their fish is great now too.  Beautiful Atmosphere.  A bit pricey for drinks...."}
{"text":"Is your sweet tooth as hungry as your belly? Then go here to feed them. French fries come out fresh and the gravy is enough for three batches of fries. The half pound burger is truly a 1/2 pound never have I had portions this filling in a restaurant like this. The chicken parm is not for those with small stomachs. If you plan to have dessert this is a dish to share.  My sweet tooth unfortunately didn't get to satiate it's hunger. My stomach couldn't get passed that chicken parm. But I will return!!!  The staff were friendly and professional.  The atmosphere is very family friendly.  Go ahead feed that hunger!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best restaurant in town! Service is great, food is fantastic, and staff is very friendly. Management is also very good; always there for your concerns. 7/5 stars."}
{"text":"My previous review wasn't supposed to be for this restaurant and unintentionally posted by my mistake.  Deep apologies for the restaurant and users who may read this review by any chance."}
{"text":"Breakfast menu I choose the western sandwhich always good here, the potatoes are always well flavored and not greasy. A fresh pot of coffee was put on for me too on a Monday morning. Week days be there for 10.30 a.m. to get the breakfast ordered before 11.00 a.m. in order to get the cheaper price or you may miss it due to the booth tables needing to be cleared which is fair enough."}
{"text":"Great cafe/lounge, with a large selection of apps, entrees, sandwiches, desserts and drinks.   Would have been a 4 stars but they ran out of hamburgers. The waiter mentioned that due to the hamburgers being a Monday special they got sold out of them at lunch time?!  C'mon that's lame.   So we ordered wraps instead,  a steak wrap and a Symposium chicken tomato wrap. They were ok but nothing amazing.   The place on the other hand is very nice. Candle lit tables, free wifi access here, cool roman murals on the wall, comfortable chairs, good R&B, top 40 mix playing in the back makes this a great place to chill.   We'll be back.."}
{"text":"They wouldn't admit a service-dog-in-training.  A letter to their corporate office didn't go anywhere either.  I think all places like this have a social and moral obligation to admit these animals who allow the handicapped to function and enjoy their respective communities.  Shame on Symposium."}
{"text":"I was with people who wanted to go, so I thought I'd give them a second chance. NOT worth it. The food was so dry and there were just so many small issues. Although the cappuccino was good though!!"}
{"text":"Great concept but dirty sofas and poor service. The lights are dim so that you can't see the used dirty couched."}
{"text":"Not impressed.... Had salad and flatbread. Salad had chicken on it. It was undercooked.. Not a good idea with chicken. Flathead was cold and soggy.  It's been awhile since I came to this location.. Now I remember why.  I'll come back maybe in another year to see if they figured it out that the food needs to be prepared by a chef that gives a shit and not some trainee from McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is a great date night spot. Nice food beautiful atmosphere and solid food. Lots of drink,dessert and couples specials. The new little jewel in the Jax"}
{"text":"I came to Symposium on a friday night with 2 of my buddies for drinks and food. The environment was pretty casual and seemed more family orientated for a friday night. We ordered a pitcher of Rickards White, and our server who was an older gentlemen took the effort to pour our drinks for us. He poured all 3 glasses half way, which resulted in us having to finish pouring our glasses...   I ordered the Chicken tenders for about $11 and change, but was disappointed with the portion of the plate, as it didn't even come with fries :(. We ordered our second pitcher and realized the bartender poured too much head (foam - more than 2 fingers of standard head) in our pitcher and asked politely for it to be re-poured. Our server again, attempted to pour the beer into one of my buddies glasses but he clearly didn't know how to pour... so we politely said we'd pour it ourselves. (look at picture).   Overall, It was not busy but it's not really a bar environment to drink in or to watch a sports game. The floor seemed over-staffed with servers and I could tell some of the servers were not experienced, including the bartender who poured our pitchers..."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I went with a party of 12 for brunch on a Saturday and everyone thought the food was just meh. Their only saving grace is that they're able to accommodate for large parties and it's close to a Subway station   Our service could have been much better. We were missing cutlery when our food arrived. It was really difficult to our our waiter's attention. The worst part is that when it came time to pay, the machine was low on paper, so he TOOK my credit card away from me, and walked away with the machine and card to look for refill paper. Waiters are NOT suppose to do that, as he could have swiped and charged without my permission. In addition, while he had my credit card in his hand looking for refill paper, he went to serve another table instead of returning to me in a timely manner. I was very disappointed in the service and I would never return or recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Visiting from California, came here with friends and family to eat brunch.  The hot chocolate was just over half full glass of milk and the rest was whipped cream. My friend also got the hot chocolate and his cup was properly full of milk and then cream on top.  Ordered the three eggs and \"farmer's sausage.\" The sausage was too soft and very white. It had a distinct vile smell. It did not smell like pork, fennel, sage, etc. Couldn't eat it. After poking at it for a while we came to the conclusion that it was turkey sausage--that'd be the only reason for the vile smell.  The waitress noticed that it hadn't been eaten and asked if everything was alright. I explained I was expecting pork sausage and instead it smelled like turkey. I said I should've perhaps gotten the bacon instead. She said she didn't know what the sausage was.  She came back after a while and said she asked and they told her it was pork. No way it is, and her claiming that it was was a bit ambitious, but I didn't argue and I only said that I should've perhaps gotten the bacon--that's the second time I said this. She said \"Perhaps next time.\" Are you serious?  There will never be a next time.  You see, in California, (and other places I've eaten in the US), the wait staff would've brought back bacon right away, the first time and asked what else they should bring to make it right. They try to make you happy. Why? They want you to come back. Simple. They'll get so much more business this way.   You see this review would've been different. I don't know what it is... perhaps the waitresses here are not empowered as they are in California. Or perhaps they don't want your business. Either way, the \"farmer's sausage\" had a vile smell and no one who ordered it ate it at our table."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time a few weeks ago for breakfast with my boyfriend and it was amazingggg!!!! I had a waffle....with chocolate ice cream.....and brownies...k don't judge me alright? Anyway, it was life changing.   A couple weeks later I went for breakfast with my girlfriends, I had a \"real\" breakfast this time, breakfast taters, french toast, and bacon and again, great food! Service was good too! And its never too busy, which I like because then that means I'm not waiting forever to stuff my face :) lol They have a huge menu, maybe a little too much selection but, i guess you cant complain at least there's variety!"}
{"text":"I like their outdoor patio, they have daily specials and the sunday dessert special is best. Enjoyed the fish tacos and chicken wraps.  Another favorite is their Caesar.  The service is usually good too."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance of this plate (with a cute little patio) don't reflect the service or food. Both times I have been here, it seemed each server was working like 10 tables and it took us a long time for simple things like getting the check or having our food wrapped up to go. This past time when I went, we ordered the egg's benedict and the poached eggs were basically boiled eggs. The yolks was completely hard and cooked... not runny like it should be with a poached egg. Kind of defeats the entire point of a benedict. The breakfast potatoes were super bland, needed a ton of salt. Omelette also had zero salt and was completely bland.   The best part was my husband ordered a glass of milk and it came 1 -- in a dirty glass, there was some sort of brown substance/residue on the inside bottom of the glass and 2 -- it had gone bad! It smelled and there were chunks floating in it.   We obviously weren't charged and the server was polite and offered to swap out our eggs but won't be returning to a place that can't tell when milk has gone bad or have clean glasses."}
{"text":"Had Benjamin benny today. The Hollandaise sauce was good and it is a really good combination with the salmon underneath the egg, since the salmon is a salty on its own. The atmosphere was good. Really enjoyed the food, as well as the service provided by Sarah and a gentleman (who I didn't catch the name:P). Will visit again:)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. It was a Friday so you would assume they would have plenty of staff. Let's just say that I have an epic sunburn now because of how long the lunch episode lasted, we sat on the patio. I have Friday off so I wasn't worried about time. I ordered a green tea/fruit smoothie and food with my bf. To wrap it up in a nutshell. We were there for about 90 minutes. My drink seriously took 30 minutes, the waiter told me 3 times it was coming. The food? I had the haddock sandwich which was lightly breaded and yummy with Greek salad, but there was barely any dressing on it ( and I don't like heavy dressing)  the cucumbers and tomatoes had obviously been in the fridge a few days. Slimy and granular, you know what I mean? My bf had a decent burger but the fries were lukewarm. Disappointing.\""}
{"text":"Service was horrible! It took them a bit to come to our table even though the place wasn't busy!  Once our waitress came and took our orders, she keep coming back and asking us about our order! I believe she forgot what we ordered!  The food was cold when it came to us and it tasted like it was sitting on the counter for awhile! Our waitress never came and check on us! Until we have to pay our bill!   The best part was the juice! It did taste like freshly squeezed as they advertised! Cutlery was cleanish, table was same but it wobbles!  Over all I probably won't be coming back! Wasn't overly impressed"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Especially the shrimp appetizer! The food is definitely not small and gives you the bang for the buck!Yum! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Two stars tops based on my dish - Stuffed eggplant. It looked very appetizing in the menu, with all the good ingredients. I thought you can't go wrong with eggplants stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.  Well, turned out you can! It was disgustingly mushy with tons of tomato sauce on top. I couldn't tell if there was any of the listed ingredients, but there was something resembling eggplant (overlooked).  The best part of the plate was a garden salad on the side, which was okay. My friend made a better choice, the salad with salmon."}
{"text":"Good food options Service is ok, perhaps more waiters? They need to be more attentive  Furniture needs to be upgraded or tapered"}
{"text":"I love it. The food,ambience,service and the price. Do check there daily specials which run a new promo every day of the week to save money. I go there more often for breakfast and dinner."}
{"text":"I will prob never go here again the food was frozen and microwaved and honestly I cook it at home for quarter of the price now I'm giving this a very lot rating because I eat out 7 days a week and at least two times a week at a restaurant where I pay $30-$60 I don't mind spending the money but if I do I want good food is that too much to ask??? The food here is more like pub food last I went I ordered chicken penne and it was bland I only ate because I was hungry!!! Had no bread with butter or anything else just plain pasta with chicken and I paid $25 for this.... would I go back ? No why because the food is not good my friend ordered the steak and only ate half the steak who eats half the steak it's supposed to be the best dish!!! It came with sautéed mushrooms which I won't even tell you what they looked like!!! This place is not worth the money sorry"}
{"text":"My family often meets here for meals and the time seems to fly. The atmosphere is just perfect. It's clear someone put a lot of time into planning this place; the layout, the decor, the menu, the staff, etc...   Our experiences are always pleasant and the food is always great, but tonight prompted me to review on yelp. Our server this evening, Kristine, was phenomenal. She was very warm and welcoming, brought us drinks immediately, explained the specials and even let us know what she found to be the best choices on the menu. I have to say she was absolutely right about everything. Calamari to die for, steak done to perfection, veggies fresh and delicious, desert...I'll get to that in a minute. We noticed that she is an incredibly intuitive person - leaving the terminal for people and stepping a few feet away; giving the person privacy without hovering, but staying close in case there was trouble or questions. Not many servers are this conscientious and considerate.   We didn't even want to leave and even as we went out the door, we were still being thanked and treated like royalty. It was the best dining experience I've had in ages, anywhere.   Now, let's talk about the brownie. Seriously people. You haven't had a brownie until you've had theirs. I'm still reeling.   Get thee to Symposium. It's heaven."}
{"text":"This was a weird experience. Possibly the least professional venue I've been to. We tried to order a bottle of wine, and after twenty minutes were informed they were out. We went with a different bottle, and received glasses of the wine instead. During this time, entrees arrived. Not ours, mind you, but someone else's. We got it sorted out eventually, and both my Thai pineapple pork and that guy's salad were good. Nothing special, but it was fine. A little later a waitress took our wine glasses away to return with a bottle of the backup wine we ordered. This was after we were almost done, about an hour after we sat down. Never had any luck getting a glass of water. Our warm cookie was mostly thawed. After failing to flag down a waitress for a bill, I gave up and stood around with my coat on. Rude, I know, but at two hours in, we just wanted out.  The place has recently opened, and could still be getting organized. Things may approve later, and you might have a better experience if you're in no rush and only ordering a burger. (Signs on TTC stops say $4/burgers and beer, but in store promotion is $5/per). Finally, aren't you not allowed to take those big, rolling garbage bins through the seating area? I thought that was a health code violation and they weren't allowed to do that."}
{"text":"For the price, the food was expected. Not great, better than mediocre. I would give it three stars if not for the service, which adds a star on its own merit. The waitstaff was attentive and concerned about maintaining an enjoyable experience. If I'm stuck in Ajax again, I would return to Symposium.  Sidenote: Nikki, the server, is gorgeous! The trip is alone with it to see her."}
{"text":"Big breakfast is great here especially with the fresh made waffle. Cappuccinos are decent. Cake slices are good as well. Service and cleanliness needs improvement. Def not the cleanest restaurant in ajax"}
{"text":"Terrible communication between all employees, you can tell staff hate working here.  So if you see my picture that is whAt we got as our \"home fries\" for breakfast  10 french fries!!!  Our server told us to complain to manager so we did. The manager told us it was the servers fault for not informing us that they were out of hashbrowns. But they were low on french fries to. All she did was offer our table a plate of french fries. What a rip offff. Do not go here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here when they opened a couple of years ago and left disappointed. Ate there again tonight and again left disappointed.  The service was poor, had to ask 4 times to get a glass of water refilled. Orders to the table came incorrect or not complete.  I had the pesto chicken and it was tasteless and boring. My friends said that the burgers were tasty.  Onion rings were quite good. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I must say the first good impression here is the decor very nice.the staff here are friendly. So I received my food and everything looks fantastic however my burger was soaking wet.after everything was all sorted out fantastic."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. prices are a bit much for what you get but wouldnt mind going back"}
{"text":"Everytime I've been here since they opened its been great! Really good service and i love their breakfast. Their drinks and food is also really good. I come here every sunday for breakfast. Love it!!"}
{"text":"The food is horrible. My breakfast was burnt. The manager was rude and the service was horrible. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I live in Meadowvale approximately 5 minutes away from the Town Centre so Symposium has been one of the go to places for me as the neighborhood is otherwise pretty dead. This is the spot I choose to go to when Streetsville seems to be too far for my taste - been here maybe 4 or 5 times so far. The place is in the middle of the Meadowvale Town Centre so be prepared to have some really empty evenings. It can get more lively over the weekend but generally I have never seen the place with more than half occupancy. But then again, this is to be expected given the location. Great place to go for a good conversation with an old friend, go out for a relaxed evening and a couple of drinks without having to drive afterwards (I can walk back home from there). The decor is actually really nice, the place looks decent, nice large booths and comfy chairs if you are not in a booth.  The positives: excellent coffee and coffee drinks list, most of them delicious. Sometimes I used to drop by with my girlfriend and have a latte or iced coffee and they always delivered! Excellent desserts, some massive cakes, one of them so large I had to split it with a friend and still had some to take home. They also have daily specials, where you can get either a burger, pasta or wings at excellent prices. I have been there at times, got full and paid a meager $25. The negatives: despite being regularly empty or half-empty, it seems that everything takes forever to make. One of the visits we were so hungry and asked for some of the most basic stuff (burger and fries) and it seemed as if they had discovered how to make it. The food generally has NOT been great, but I would not be as extreme as the other reviewers. Most of the time it is decent but yes, nothing to get overly excited about.  I really love the location, the vibe and the atmosphere. Love having this option close to home in a nicely decorated place and knowing I can always find a seat. It loses one star on relatively mediocre food but makes up for it with the coffees and dessert. The reason it doesn't make it back to 5 stars is the consistent slow service (I tend not to judge service over one visit only as it could be an outlier, but having this happen every single visit shows lack of training and/or care)."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite place to eat in Bolton. We have dinner here regularly and it's the only decent breakfast in town. We love the spicy white wine mussels on Wednesdays! And the crepes and waffles! Mmm!"}
{"text":"Sunday night after work, we (a co worker) were trying to find a place for some wine. We settled in Symposium on Dundas and Winston Churchill; the old Fox and Fiddle. We walk in, and are greeted, sat in the lounge, and told that the server would be around shortly. About 10 minutes goes by....no server. I walk up to the bar. The manager (or looked like one) and a server are having a conversation (the same one as when we walked in). I say \"excuse me, I'd like to order\" he says \"you'd like to order something?\"  I say \"yes, that is what I am here for\" He then inquires if a server has been by, when I tell him no, instead of taking my drink order, he says he will send someone over. To my surprise, the young man that sat us showed up. His shirt was untucked, had no apron on. I said hello and asked if he was our server? He said \"yah, sorry I was just doing dishes\" as he wiped his hands down the side of his pants....  While we walked out, no one even tries to stop is..... Needles to say, that completely pissed me off (being servers ourselves),  we left and went to JJ's instead!  Which in itself says a lot.  ...I will not return to Symposium. The experience was lacking in customer service. The manager was busy socializing to take a drink order, apologize or do anything for that matter.  aned since when does a dishwasher do triple duty!? Host, server and dishwasher....NO Thank you."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Symposium restaurants, and the food here is nothing like any of them, regardless of what the menu or the server says. I have never had a good meal there and today was no exception. We ordered the grilled fish sandwich, which I had in Stouffville and it was incredible - two large pieces of haddock cooked perfectly on a super soft bun. Absolutely disgusting at this location. The bun, which was obviously not fresh, was toasted and very greasy (slathered in butter/margarine), then smushed down like a panini. There was very little fish, just small bite sized pieces shoved into a bun; very salty. There was one small piece of ROTTED lettuce on top. They cannot cook; do not follow he"}
{"text":"The food was great. We had the grilled fish sandwich. It came with two large pieces of haddock cooked perfectly on a super soft bun. It was delicious. The service was excellent as well. The cakes in the display were amazing, but we were too full to try any. Next time."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has a quaint atmosphere with lots and lots of windows as well as a really top notch menu! I had the mushroom Swiss burger and I was not the least bit disappointed, much to the chagrin of my friends who don't like mushrooms and gravy nearly as much as I do! Also, the dessert selection is really nice! I was eyeing the cakes on display for almost the entire visit and~darn it~ am I kicking myself for not getting any of them! The only snafu we really had was the parking situation. Don't park by the side if you're in a large vehicle. It's quite the chore to back out."}
{"text":"I can only say. The place is nice and quite and can be a great place for a date. I had a chicken souvlaki and it tasted great!!!  I would recommend it if you don't mind the price."}
{"text":"Been here a few times,  this time for breakfast. The breakfast was ok, nothing really worth noting except some nicer fancy coffees.  There are better places for breakfast in Ajax, but nothing wrong with Symposium."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time going to symposium I came to location! Had breakfast (basic scrambled with cheese) it was very good I loved the potatoes with it. The cups and mugs for coffee/water were clean!  I also had the strawberry banana orange smoothie which was fresh and yummy. I stayed the whole day I did some work, got to know the servers and one of the managers. Super friendly and very helpful. For lunch had the mussels marinara and asked for it to be in a rose sauce which was very good. 4 stars because they were too salty.   Second time I came back I asked for the same server, Christine! She's wonderful. Had the breakfast again and received the same service if not better. They also have way to many severs on at once. Which isn't a bad thing but also not too great for them!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm. The server was an old man and there were 2 other girls on staff. Worst service ever. There was a group of 10 in the restaurant and that's it. Looks like it was more than these guys could handle.   Anyway after waiting for 20 minutes without so much as a waiter coming by we left. Waste of 30 mins.   Oh there were also 2 girls waiting at the front for 20 minutes that walked away since no one went up to greet them.   What a shit show. Will not return."}
{"text":"Went for brunch it was amazing I had eggs Benedict so good I ate it all also I had dessert afterwards I had the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top it was warm I wish it was warmer and not burned at the bottom, :( that part was a little disappointing"}
{"text":"European themed Cafe. Great for desserts & tea and coffee.  Had the symposium burger. Super juicy and very filing. Wait wasn't too long & service was friendly. There are many things on the menu. Would say that this is a higher end restaurant. Only downside is the cleanliness of the restrooms, other than that the rest of the restaurant looks clean and the decorations are attractive."}
{"text":"After Mac's closed down, I've been dying to find out what store would take its' place - and soon enough, Symposium Cafe opens!   I've had their Vaughan location bookmarked to try, but never got the chance to and now there's a location so close to home!   First off, the portions here are enormous so come with an empty stomach. They have daily specials that you can take advantage of whether you're here for dinner, dessert or just a drink (the cocktail list is quite extensive).   The spinach dip here is one of the best I've had, they're very generous with the pita bread and the dip comes in a large bowl, you'll never run out.   The cake selection here is decent. I've tried the colossal carrot cake and it really isn't colossal and was disappointly dry. I've tried their waffle desserts and those are a much better choice than their cakes.   Most of the servers are under training but very pleasant. I'll definitely be back to try out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Symposium for a late dinner with a friend last night.  This location used to be the old Fox & Fiddle a few years back and I have not been to the location since Symposium moved in.  I was pleasantly surprised by the location.  It has a loungey vibe and great to bring a date.  Their menu is extensive, pages of choices.   They are known for their desserts, I opted for the Fruit Festival waffle.  It was delish, lots of fruit and the waffle was done right.  My friend ordered wings, mussels (they were on special) and cake.  He devoured all three, with a big smile.    Bonus, there was live music on Wednesday nights.  The server mentioned Saturday nights they have live music as well.    Symposium is definitely a great hang out spot; I plan on coming back in the future.  PS.  They also have an all day breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited this cafe the other day for brunch at around 11:30am. The staff are always so friendly and the place is always clean with a great atmosphere. I love how high the ceilings are and how open the layout of the restaurant was. This location is great if you're looking for a place to grab some food or drinks and catch up with friends. We ended up sitting and chatting for 3 hours.   I ordered the eggs benedict with a cafe latte and it was delicious. The portions are on the larger side as my friends and I were stuffed by the end of our meal. The presentation of the food was also really appealing. I loved their home fries as they are the perfect amount of crisp and are not drenched in oil. The price was also great as my meal came to about $15.   I would definitely recommend this location if  - you and your friends are looking for a place to catch up for a long time  - you are looking for a place with a large variety of food options or an extensive drink menu"}
{"text":"THE. WORSE. EXPERIENCE.   EVER.   I arrived with three of my friends and we waited to be seated. This process took maybe 5 minutes which was fine i suppose. During that time, a couple walked into the door. The manager knew the couple, and proceeded to greet them first and shake hands with them. The man asked him if they could have the booth seat, which I overheard. I interjected and stated that we were here first so we should get the last booth seating, plus we had more people. The manager looked at the couple and shook his shoulders and said sorry. At that time, and man proceeded to say, \"that's ok. I'll eat your food off the ground its so good. I won't let a few broads piss me off.\" The manager did not reprimand his behavior, even though I'm sure that no other customer would have gotten away with disrespecting other customers in such a way if they weren't personal friends with the manager. Clearly this manager has never had customer service training, because that is definitely not the way you try to build repeat customers. Not only do I have a negative view of this particular restaurant in Thornhill, but of the entire chain as well.   I wouldn't recommend this establishment to anyone. Not even my worse enemy. I will definitely never be visiting ANY symposium restaurant again. Nobody deserves to be treated with such disrespect as a paying customer."}
{"text":"This is really great restaurant.  The food is good - I recommend ALL of the desserts. Also have tried the pasta and burgers are they are delicious. Prices are pretty good, and their weekly specials you can't beat.  Saturday night pitcher specials are awesome. Some of the daquiris and margaritas are a bit too \"watered down\" with slush but the sangria's are good. Definitely make a reservation for the weekends."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side compared to other restaurant, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"You have to try the Mussels Florentine and make sure to order extra garlic toast that comes with it..you're going to need it for all of the deliciousness that makes up the sauce they're bathed in!  Tried the burgers as well and they're nice and juicy.  They have daily specials which is perfect if you want to try everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Good vibes in this place. Nice social spot to chill out and go with friends. The food, desserts and drinks are mediocre, if you're looking for really good food this is not the place. There is live entertainment sometimes which adds to the nice vibe of this place. If you're in a hurry to eat, this is not a quick place to go to, there are long waiting times. If you're in no hurry, want a nice spot to hang out and eat some decent food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I really love that we are finally getting places to eat and drink, in this area (beyond sports bars) that are open late even during weekdays. Symposium Cafe, I understand, is a chain, but this was my first time being in one. A friend of mine highly recommended it, and what was supposed to be a coffee, ended up being a few appetizers, dessert, and coffee.  We ordered mussels marinara, an order of fries, and chicken tenders, but before I talk about the food itself...  I'm just going to get the \"bad\" out of the way first,. And before I do, please know that the staff completely fixed the issue and were sympathetic (which I will touch on more later) so before reading further, just understand that this is really no ones fault but the managements.  The mussels arrived and were good (not the best but FAR from bad). Fries are fries and they were totally fine as well - especially the dipping sauce they come with! really tasty. But as for the chicken tenders....  Okay, there's no nice way to say this: for $12, you get a single chicken breast, cut into 4-6 pieces, dredged in barely seasoned flour. So not only do you feel cheated for paying $12 for a single chicken breast, but it's not even a GOOD chicken breast. You know what I'm totally fine with for $12? Those giant frozen chicken tenders you can get literally anywhere. On what planet is charging $12 for 5 small pieces of chicken okay? Either adjust the product to reflect the price or take it off the menu, please. that is just about my only gripe, and it was just one item, so it definitely wasn't the worst thing to happen during a dining experience. I just don't like feeling cheated, as a patron. So if you go here: steer clear of that item! Our server was kind enough to swap them for wings, and the wings were totally fine and enjoyable. So it's odd to me that they choose to charge that price for that, when everything else is totally reasonable and perfectly fine.  Having said that, the friend I was with and myself are definitely not ones to complain but there was no way we were going to pay $12 for a cut up chicken breast. Our server was a SAINT about it - She completely understood and swapped it for chicken wings with no issues at all. Actually, our server was very friendly and attentive the entire time we were there. I also liked that after she brought our bill she made a point to make us feel welcome to stay at our leisure.  So I'd have to say the service, for my first time there, was 10/10.   we ended with splitting a chocolate brownie cheesecake and ice cappuccino - both were really good (but I'm biased because I'd eat my own foot if it were covered in cheesecake). I promise it's good, though.  The atmosphere is nice! comfortable and clean, which is all I really care about when dining out. Price wise... I can't say it's expensive or inexpensive to eat here. It's on the cusp of 'reasonable' but a little on the higher end. So, do with that what you will.  The reason I am giving 3 stars is because: 1. the food was perfectly good and standard, but not outstanding. 2. MOSTLY because I've only been once (and consistency is hugely important to me). If I go again - and I do fully intend to return - and the service was just as good, and the food was about the same or better, then I'll absolutely bump the rating up to 4!  definitely recommend you at least try it out!  edit: updating my review because I've been several times and it's been pretty good every time!"}
{"text":"Holy crap the service was horrendous! If I can give it a negative star I would! When the manager asked how many people, he was told 6, then he proceeded to ask again three more times! He first took us to a table for four until the entire party said we need a table for six! He finally brought us to a table that was actually disgusting and we called attention to it and he completely ignored us. Finally another server came and wiped it down! My husband ordered a coffee and when it did finally came there was lipstick on the rim!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my friends, I ordered an omelette without cheese although it came with cheese. Luckily, I scraped the brie cheese out of the omelette. The service was slow so I knew if I returned it to the kitchen (this was 1/4 i to eating it), my friends would be done their meal before me. It was a little terrifying there was cheese in this as I have a very bad reaction. They gave me 50% off although due to poor service and the food mis hap, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Just a really middle-of-the-road, non-offensive restaurant at Meadowvale Town Centre.  I stopped here for a lunch meeting with some co-workers and had the burger lunch special. The ambience was quite nice, and it was fairly quiet. They were training a new waiter when we came in, and they were both appropriately helpful and attentive to our needs. The seating was incongrously expansive (the booths are huge), but I can't complain.  The food quality was alright - I wasn't blown away by the burger, but it was serviceable. This seems like the kind of place that would a prime hangout for seniors - it just has this sort of relaxed, quaint vibe that seems to go well with the nature of the mall itself. Might be worth a pit stop if you're at the mall, but don't go out of your way to try it out."}
{"text":"I've been at this location for brunch and dinner.  I love the European decor and ambiance.    The service was great and the servers are very friendly and helpful.  Plenty of different food selection.  Love their daily specials and their prices are very good for what you get!  I can't wait until the patio opens so that we can enjoy that area!  We will definitely continue going.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Worst $7.01 I have spent on a cappuccino that tasted like a regular Tim Hortons coffee that was very bitter."}
{"text":"rather disappointing after i heard so much good about hte place. good dessert, but seemed to be out of many items that day, and to top it off the server was less than helpful and seemed like she'd rather be else where."}
{"text":"The place receives one extra star due to their atmosphere. The cafe is on the note of food is average. The portions are good but the food taste in the average to OK category. Their lattes are quite good and I did enjoy them!  The restaurant is quite big and various types of seating (couches, chairs, and booths). The Door host and the server was quite good and friendly. Their is plenty of parking as it's located in Meadowvale town centre.  I don't know about food but I might come for their lattes and deserts."}
{"text":"Well what can one say about a restaurant that has an army of wait staff 25 patrons and multiple mistakes made at a single table? We arrived after making reservations for 7 to find them hastily assembling our table located in the hottest and sunniest part of the restaurant. Drinks were ordered and arrived on time. Flatbreads also arrived after 15 mins. Entrees arrived slowly over about half an hour. My veggie wrap was bland and was grilled with lettuce in it that was slimy and flaccid. Other food was dried out or ok. The last two orders arrived as the majority were finished. The error on one dinner was supposed to be remedied by a comped  desert from the manager. This information failed to make it to the server. The wrong number of deserts were brought to the table as we sat at the table with the hot sun creeping across the seats. Overall this was not a great experience and we will not be returning. This is sad as we had hoped to have found a great new place to eat in Markham. The management definitely needs to tighten things up with the army of staff, many of whom were standing around or dancing and singing karaoke style to the music in the restaurant. Finally the drink cards on the tables were sticky and dirty. This is the sign of a staff who are simply going through the the motions."}
{"text":"Service was very nice..however we were served a very limp Caesars salad...a side and a boat...both seemed like they had been made and dressed two days ago.  It was not edible.  We told our waitress who apologized and asked if we wanted another or something else.  At that point we didn't.  We were very disappointed when we saw that we were charged for this dreadful salad. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday for 2. It was busy, wait wasn't that long. Service wasn't the greatest, I didn't even know my servers name. Don't expect a warm introduction or notifications of the specials of the day. Food was mediocre. My coffee was burnt. I would recommend their orange juice, it's freshly squeezed and delicious. After we were eating, it took awhile to get the bill. I understand they were busy but knowing the basics of customer service goes along way. I won't be going back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Up and down.  Food: very good.  Service: crap.  Couldn't have been more than 7 tables with diners, and 4 or 5 wait staff, yet our wait person didn't come by between dropping off food and the delivery of the bill.  No coffee,no drink refills, no check on food quality : nothing.  They all stood around the dessert counter chatting."}
{"text":"Service is horrible! Peter does not know how to manage the restaurant and how to talk to customers. He's very unprofessional. I ordered the cookie with ice cream and the cookie was so hard I could barely cut it up to eat it. I've had ice cream cookies at other places and I know for a fact a cookie is not supposed to be that hard. When I brought it to their attention, Peter comes over and goes \"we put the cookie in the oven and then put ice cream on top of it and if you don't eat it right away it hardens\" mind you we were there for like 20 minutes, its not like i let it sit there for hours. And then he is like \"well next time you don't like something let us know right away, don't wait till the end cause that's kind of shady\" EXCUSE ME??? You think I'm gonna waste my time for 6 bucks? Give me a break!"}
{"text":"Oh this cafe. I really dislike giving negative reviews. This was my second time visiting and my last. Myself and four girlfriends met up after work on a Friday, just before 5pm. Amongst us we ordered lattes and beer, while waiting for our 5th member to arrive. We then went on to have some apps and dessert. While our server was kind, we were asked strange questions - \"the cook is wondering if you're ordering from the menu or having dessert\" which begged the question - is the chef looking to head home? We were then asked if we would be on separate bills - normal question! But then our bills were brought to us. The server explained we were welcome to stay until close (1am) but she was heading home for the night. Afterwards, we had one woman poke her head over but no one else returned to see if we needed more drinks. Just over 30 minutes after our server left, a gentleman who I assume is the manager asked how we were doing - my friend mentioned that no one had come around to offer us another round. He then asked us how long we were planning to stay - that a reservation was coming in 10-15 minutes. When said friend then mentioned the poor service, there was no real compassion. We were only there for 2 hours and would have loved to stay and chat with another beer! Sorry symposium. I was iffy to come back, and my feelings served true. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim because other brunch places were full. Haha what luck because it ended up being an amazing brunch with top notch service and great food.   We ordered: Salmon Benedict with tomato infused hollandaise (what!!) Chicken sandwich  Our server, Daniel, was excellent. Friendly, courteous and funny. I wanted to be his friend after the meal. Damnnnn Daniel!   Food itself was amazing! Good portions and the price was right. I would definitely go again.   The owner came by our table to check which was awesome. Highly highly recommend. Hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Dirty restaurant. Looks like under new management which made the place unbearable. You lost a regular!  Going next door to Tera.  Will change the review once you sell the place again."}
{"text":"The food is ok, the place is kind of pricey, the good side is there is a choice for everyone. Depending on the server, the service could be good or you could be waiting while the server is showing something in his phone to a coworker at the desert bar, this does not stop even if you scream for some help."}
{"text":"Went here with my friends and we all had a good time. The place was rustic and cozy! All those renaissance murals and paintings on the walls were beautiful and seats and tables were comfortable. I had the banquet burger and my friends had the pasta with crabs, and chicken parmigiano. We fell in love with food and abundant servings. Drinks were yummy and refreshing. And the desserts! The DESSERTS! Looked and tasted divine  and marissa our waitress did a fantastic job. She was so cheerful and accommodating. Will definitely recommend this café!"}
{"text":"Glad to have one in this area - so close to where my new residence will be. It's a great meet up place for groups and friends and the food is so average that it will cater to anyone's taste.  Feeling like cake for dessert of sandwhiches for food, you come here for the discussions that are going to take place rather than groumet grub.  On that note, love the patio they have for summer - my friends and I came here close to midnight, and the temp was humid-y so we decided to cool down with shakes and a banana split."}
{"text":"BUSY! Especially on weekends. A group of us came here Saturday night (10-ish) and the lines to get in were long. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes-ish until a group finally left. Despite that, I can see why people still wait. The atmosphere is cozy but modern and even though with lots of people chatting, it's not so loud that you can't have a decent conversation.  The  menu is full-some as you can get a meal, or just dessert, or just coffee/coffee drinks and of course wine's and shots. This makes Symposium Café a any-time place to meet. My friends just wanted coffee and cake (by the way, on Sunday's they have a 2 for 1 cake special). The 7 layer carrot cake is MASSIVE! I tried a bite of my friends Strawberry Shortcake and it was sufficiently creamy with lots of white chocolate. YUM!  Service was very attentive considering how full house the place was. The only downfall for me is that this place is soooooo far away from my boring uptown home. I would recommend this place as a great group-coffee-dessert-get-together place except the reality is often long lines on weekends."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place you guys. Seriously. I'm so torn between a 2 and a 3 based on the fact that I was apart of a large group but I think I'm gonna take the lower here because the food was of such a poor quality.   We were a group of about 20 or so, so understandably not an easy task for the staff. The staff were the winners here, and definitely worked hard to keep the train on the track. That said, the staff approached our group with \"a plan\" which they kept assuring would keep orders straights and limit mistakes.   The plan worked on the front end for \"taking\" orders, but on the back end it was a hot mess. I had ordered the Jack Daniels Steak off the set menu they provided our group and subbed a Caesar salad for the steamed veggies.   I provided my order so that it could easily be distinguished from the rest of the group who ordered the \"steak\". As mentioned their plan fell to shit as soon as the first order rolled out. They had no idea what food went where. I was asked if I ordered every food item except for what I actually ordered. My fiancée was the only one to order the pasta and that didn't come out for ages either, in fact they tried to give her steak on three separate occasions.   I knew not to expect much from the food, but their kitchen even managed to disappoint my adjusted expectations. The jack Daniels steak was maybe 4oz of very tough chopped up poor quality beef (hardly a steak), poorly cooked and hard to cut and worst of all covered up with a ton of watered down BBQ sauce. Yep, bottled BBQ sauce on a small shitty cut of beef. Divine.   To make matters worse, They couldn't even execute a Caesar salad properly. The creamy, bottle dressing wasn't even mixed through and sat in clumps throughout.   Shit show. Top to bottom.   I'm a fan of Symposium for desserts and coffee and maybe even the occasion breakfast, but what a train wreck for lunch/dinner. Definitely won't ever return and given the choice... go somewhere, anywhere else. Blegh...   Front of house Staff were the only thing who  saved them from a flat out 1 star.   Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"Symposium as a chain is pretty consistently alright. Their menu is extensive tending to be a dessert, coffee and wine driven though they certainly sell main courses to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as a whole slew of teas, cocktails and shakes. The restaurant is dimly lit creating a really nice intimate feel, but the 'renaissance' inspired decor is kitschy.  What makes this particular location a step above other Symposiums is the live jazz music Wednesday and Saturday nights.  I love Symposium as a place to catch up with friends one-on-one but according to their website they 'specialize in large groups', which on this particular evening had attracted three groups of 15+.  In my opinion Symposium is nothing extraordinary, but if you're looking for a place to catch up with a friend, it's a good option."}
{"text":"Not good... avoid.  Food is over priced.. not much on the menu that seem good. Service is okay. Dessert is just MEH."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awful; I couldn't even tell if the potatoes were from a real vegetable! The food was not tasty and service was poor. We had to make constant reminders for drink refills and to catch anyone's attention. Menu selection is also limited for those who prefer a healthy meal option.  The venue itself felt quite dirty and it was not a comfortable atmosphere to meet with friends. If there is a positive, the space has enough room to accommodate larger groups without an issue."}
{"text":"Food was horrible and cold.  Had to send it back and wasn't any better the second time.   Deserts were good, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was the good service from our waiter. Besides that, it was very underwhelming. I ordered an eggs florentine was is about $11. Came with a side of potatoes which were cold. The spinach had no flavour at all and the hollandaise sauce was bland. I've definitely had much better else where. Won't be returning here for breakfast. Maybe I'll give their lunch or dinner menu a chance some time."}
{"text":"From reading previous reviews we did not have high expectations going in, however the level of quality at that price did not please us.  Let's start by saying the restaurant is quite nice, open and clean. Our server was prompt, friendly and made sure our needs were met. The washrooms were clean as well. Prices are a little on the high side, but affordable. Coffee was good.  The food was sub par.   We had the Eggs Benedict and French Toast. The eggs were very bulbous and round, cutting into them revealed a thoroughly cooked yolk (to the level of a medium-hard boiled egg). The eggs were topped with only a mere table spoon of hollandaise sauce, not nearly enough to even cover the eggs entirely. Pea meal bacon and home fries were okay. The French toast was slightly on the burnt side due to the sugar or honey that they must have beaten into the eggs. The taste was okay but nothing spectacular. For the medium-high price point the food quality should have been better. I expect this type of food at a greasy diner, not at a cafe/lounge.   We will not be going back to Symposium."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a casual brunch and found the place to be a little nicer than I originally thought. We turned out to be a tad under-dressed, but that's okay. I can imagine this would be a popular place for dates because of the relaxing atmosphere, chic decor, and evening drinks / desserts.   Anyway, we had brunch, Eggs Benedict and Tuscan Benedict were delicious. The Hollandaise sauce was so good that it didn't overly stand out and blended into the dish real well. We were also very surprised to find 3 poached eggs on our plates instead of the typical two eggs. Nice touch! The home fries were crispy and flavourful and came out piping hot. We also ordered an additional dish to share (we were starving), french toast with a salad bowl. The French toast was very tastey, and already sweetened so we didn't even need to open the syrup container.   Service was friendly and swift. A much better experience than another Symposium location I've been to somewhere in the east end of the city."}
{"text":"amazing service, food and ambiance. we've been here many times at different hours and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"They made very good desserts. I had the carrot cake which tasted great. The problem was the slice was very thin and costs $9. I also had their chicken pesto flat bread and the pulled pork sandwich. Those were very disappointing!! The flat bread tasted bland. The pulled pork tasted like they used cheap Kraft BBQ sauce. I couldn't even finish the meal. The decor was very chic and clean. Service was slow even though not many people were there. I won't be coming back, sorry."}
{"text":"Very nice place and very convenient for a late night out. The stuff aren't really friendly but, I go there for the ambience and the late working hours."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 star for this location, I would. This was my second (and of course last time) at this location. The hostess was very unpleasant when we entered and asked to sit on the patio on that sunny day, she tried to prevent us from going to patio as she claimed there were bees outside and if we want to move inside then they \"can't help\" us and bring our food/drinks back inside! Like isn't that part of their job? In addition to that, when I got my strawberry milkshake, the cup was all overfilled and milkshakes all around the cup, my hands got sticky from cleaning that up with no napkins around! And worst than that, the server brought the bill without us asking for it, obviously to kick us out just because we didn't sit inside and they had to make the extra trip to the patio! What a terrible service! Will not recommend nor ever go back to this location!!"}
{"text":"I never ate at Symposium before and one cold Sunday morning, we bundled up and headed on over.  The staff was good, not super friendly but they did their job.  The atmosphere is okay, It just didn't feel like the usual places I got for brunch but rather would probably enjoy the night scene alot better.  I got the waffles with caramel banans and eggs. It was good, sweet and was what I wanted. No complaints. My bf for the crab cake with eggs benedict. The concept was good and it tasted good. The problem was that the crab cake was very thin and just didn't have much to it. It was a miss.   The food was okay. I'm not jumping to go back to Symposium for brunch again as they are a lot better places around Toronto. I would go again to try the martinis for a girls night."}
{"text":"When they first opened, my family and and I came here all the time so I've tried a few different items. I've had and enjoyed the Mussels Marinara, Cajun dusted Shrimp, Fish and Chips , Wings, Bruschetta, Firecracker Shrimp and the Roasted Veg Flatbread. My parents are addicted to the carrot cake and the Monday cheap hamburger my husband said was not bad. I would not particularly recommend the martinis and the waffles are not consistent. I had to send my waffle ice cream sandwich back for not being cooked properly (the waffle was heavy and doughy instead of fluffy and light) and the time before that I just stopped eating it early on because it was not good at all. I was not impressed by the breakfast that I had their but I am a picky breakfast person since I cook pretty excellent breakfast food at home."}
{"text":"Stopped by one evening with family. Sat on the patio and enjoyed a beer and fish and chips. It was great. Loved it."}
{"text":"I LOVE Symposium's all day breakfast!! I always get the egg breakfast and either a cappuccino or a chai latte, both made fresh and to order (personally I find them better and more authentic then Starbucks pricey version). The portions are big and the prices are pretty good.  Also for the burger lovers out there, Monday is their cheap burger and draft beer night. Each under $4!!  Not to be forgotten is their extensive martini menu, offering martini Saturdays where you can get a martini for $4! Personally, my favourite is the frozen chocolate martini as it is to die for.  These are one of the places I will be back to time and time again :D"}
{"text":"Come here for dinner before they sent us a coupon so why not try this place out. They have special everyday and happy hour before 6pm and late night starting at 10pm. Can check the details on their website. I've ordered a Swiss mushroom burger and JD steak wrap average in $16. It comes with fries but they put so much salt on it so I need to take away some salt on each fries. The burger taste normal but I'm not too impressed with the steak wrap.  First the wrap is small and second it's not very flavorful.  With the same price I have many more options that serve better food so I may not consider coming back or maybe just once in a very while. They definitely need to improve their cooks to get more traffic"}
{"text":"If you're looking to go to Symposium, go to the North York location! I've eaten at the Richmond Hill location, and it's just not the same.  This location has good service, good food, and an awesome patio.  I had a souvlaki wrap, and though it tasted more like a chicken caesar wrap, it was very delicious. The chicken was very tender, and it was filling. The fries were a little mushy on the inside for my taste- but still not bad. My friend also enjoyed his mushroom swiss burger.  I wouldn't mind coming back to this location to try their drinks and dessert next time."}
{"text":"Went here a few times. Loved the atmosphere, even though some things are damaged and teared (such as the seats). The food is good for the most part, one or two things weren't so good, pricing I would say a little high. It's better to go on specific days that they have deals."}
{"text":"stopped in this place for some apps and cake and we ended up with stomach aches. the whole experience was a dissapointment.  we had clamari which was rubbery and a small portion. i am a huge calamari fan and this dish was a huge dissapointment.  i have had calamari at the brampton symposium many times and loved it everytime.  we also had a pita bread pizza type bread with gouda and chicken. the gouda was shredded and sparring. the chicken lacked flavour and fell off the pita with each bite due to lack of cheese to meld it all together.  the cheescake was ok. it was extremely soft, nearly a mouse texture and it lacked the delicious graham cracker bottom which is my fav part of cheesecake.  the chocolate caramel cake was also a mousse like texture. the caramel was drizzled on top and was eaten in two bites by my 4 year old. the cake lacked any other caramel flavour. it was a large piece and most of it was left behind.  i ordered a steamed milk to go with the cake and they forgot to serve it.  one star is generous for this place. i would give it a zero if i could."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience?. This was on March 14, at 10:30pm. The waiter was very rude; my husband was having soup... He came around to take his plate away three times and at last made my husband so uncomfortable that he didn't even get to finish his souo!!!! He was disrespectful to everyone in our table (there were 12 of us) to the extent that no one wanted to pay tip (of course he did tip 15%because we were a big group). Just horrible experience!!! The servers in the morning are usually nice though."}
{"text":"This place has really good food but service can be slow. We really like that server A.K... Such a funny and nice guy!  Also, I'm pretty disappointed that the breakfast menu no longer extends into the late hours. Customers would come back for that option."}
{"text":"Incredible staff and atmosphere. The décor is something everyone will appreciate, especially history enthusiasts.  My server was beyond wonderful. She brought me my coffee and some water and left me write and read until I was ready to order. I must have sat here for almost an hour and a half writing before she walked over when I smiled at her.  I ordered the Chicken Pesto Sandwich on a ciabatta with a side Greek salad and I was floored by the flavours. Truly amazing. I strongly recommend this café/bar to everyone looking for a unique dining experience (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) or even to come and have a couple of drinks.  I will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The meal was okay. Ham was way too salty. I've had better elsewhere. Not sure why but I had a hard time waving a server over. Hope they improve soon"}
{"text":"I've been back several times. I do enjoy the environment, and the staff attentiveness issues have improved."}
{"text":"Went there today with the family. Amazing fast service. The kids ordered the waffles and chocolate milk and I ordered the Tuscan florentine.  Amazing!!!! The best I've ever had, fresh and perfectly cooked. This is the second time I've gone and it's my favourite breakfast place in town. I would go back absolutely"}
{"text":"It's an okay place for dessert like any other crepe/waffle spot.I wish they had special crepes to offer since they're well known and had limited dessert options. I had the East Meets West Crepe which consisted of two crepe pouches, one filled with vanilla ice cream and the other filled with chocolate ice cream cream. It's not your standard flat crepe with toppings on top. Symposium makes sure your crepe doesn't get soggy and lays out fresh strawberries and banana slices on each side of the plate drizzled with chocolate syrup... The crepe portion is quite small, but delicious!   I also ordered a cappuccino with Irish cream and was offered the option of getting cinnamon or chocolate powder, I chose chocolate powder since I don't like cinnamon in my hot beverage but they accidentally forgot and I ended up with cinnamon, no biggie a quick swipe to remove the foam and all was forgiven, especially considering the great customer service by the staff!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here we had beer and flatbread on the patio and it was amazing.   My second visit for lunch however, was horrible. They had amazing pictures of Daquiris so I ordered the sour cherry one, instead I got a watery, foamy mess with no flavour. Asked the server to fix it and it wasn't much better. The sesame chicken wrap I ordered was so ice cold it hurt my teeth. On the bright side the mussels and soup we also ordered were good. Overall not worth the 'finer dining' atmosphere and pricing they give off."}
{"text":"Was in the area for an appointment and decided to take out some breakfast before heading home. Ordered the Eggs Benjamin, but when I got home I realized they forgot the hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, friendly staff and amazing food! What else can you ask for.. Totally recommended! Everything we order was delicious.."}
{"text":"I typically go here for breakfast or late in the evening for coffee with company.   The salmon on eggs Benedict is my favourite breakfast item.   The cappuccinos and lattes are worth trying.  The have a special every day that is worthwhile, such as half price cake on Saturdays, makign this a good and affordable desert venue as well."}
{"text":"Just back from trying for the first time. Drive by it many a times.    Atmosphere was good. Quiet for a Tuesday night. Music wasn't too loud. Not busy at all.   Calamari was ok. Batter was a bit bland. Nothing special. Mussel marinara was good. Wasn't too watered down, and tomatoes weren't too chunky. Nice taste to it, thoroughly  enjoyed.   I tried the peanut chicken satay on rice. Lots of different flavors in the little bowl. Peanut wasn't too overpowering.   Also had the seafood pasta. Nice creaminess to it. Not too thick and nicely seasoned. The toast that came was a bit over cooked, making it very dry & chewy.   Overall was nice quiet dinner. One thing we found awkward is that every time the manager came by to ask us how we were, the waiter would swoop in and ask the same thing;as if he was on probation or something and wanted to make sure we didn't complain. Happened more than once making it noticeable.   Will definitely go again as the rest of the menu items looked interesting."}
{"text":"wife and I ordered the 'signature' east meets west crepe.  horrible idea as the crepe was hard to chew on and the strawberries were not defrosted yet (yup frozen strawberries).  Waiter admitted that the crepes were not made fresh and just re-warmed.. crazy for a signature dish!  Sent it away and got the chocolate brownie waffles instead which were freshly made.    We like coming for weekday breakfasts so i'll probably just stick with that."}
{"text":"The spot is like R.Kelly's remix to ignition because it's \"hot and fresh out the kitchen\" - because it just opened Yesterday (how's that for a fresh FTR). I've been a fan of the symposium brand (yes yes yes I know it's a chain), since my years as a student in Waterloo when taking a girl you met at the bar a week earlier meant that things were \"getting serious\". Enough about my lusty days as a co-ed (save those for another day).  The topic at hand Thornhill's newest edition, Symposium Cafe. Taking over the location where the failed Licks Home-burgers, Kenny Rogers Roasters AND even McDonald's before that (ya I've lived around here for a long time) used to be, I've got my fingers crossed for this classy little joint,  First off walking up you cannot miss their huge signage, BUT your attention is quickly diverted from the signage to the elegance and sophistication that is their front patio. Black on Black neuvo patio furniture is surrounded by a black iron fence and large ornate gates also inscribed with the Cafes name.   Walking inside this place continues to be class class class all the way. Gorgeous fixtures, a mix of rich wood and marble table tops and tobacco coloured wing back leather chairs. This place is really done up to the nines!  As per the norm with other Symposiums the desserts and the bar are the main focal points with both on display and an impressive sit down bar area which is uncommon from other locations.  My colleague and I took a booth near the front to discuss worldly issues (the Olympics) and other things of that sort and were quickly offered menus. Being that it was likely 5 o'clock somewhere I decided on a Caesar (with a kick) and a flat iron steak house salad, while my friend ordered up a cappuccino.   The bevvies took time to come but when they arrived and while attempted to make a Caesar to my taste it was essentially just clamato juice and celery salt (forgettable) - the garnish was a lemon and lime wedge, not even a celery stalk. WTF? My coffee addicted friend seemed content with the Cappuccino but did mention that he prefers to be asked whether or not he'd like cinnamon or chocolate on top instead of it coming standard.  As for my Salad, I am honestly torn on which way to go with my opinion here. The handful of steak pieces I received were cooked and flavoured amazingly. YUM. But I literally got 5 teeny tiny medallions. The mixed greens and veggies were super fresh and there was a lot of them however I had to ask for dressing because the salad came bone try (other than the sauce which rubbed off the steak).   Lastly we shared in a slice of their Carrot Cake. Can you say MONEY MAKER!!! This is what Symposium is all about - wowza! This thing was 2.5 normal slices of normal carrot cake compacted into 1. It was moist and creamy and even had cranberries mixed in for a secret X-factor. DAyyyuuummmmmmm girl!!  The food and drink may have made Symposium take a hit on score, BUT given that it literally just opened yesterday they are A-OK in my books and can only go up from here :)  I shall return and I know they will impress. I see this place being a new summer work spot and night time patio hang out, come with me :)  ** Wifi is password protected so make sure to ask your servers"}
{"text":"This was my first time enjoying Symposium Cafe! But I will. def. go back, the food and drinks were great, dessert menu is AMAZING!!!! Servers were friendly and attentive but not intrusive!  The atmosphere was quiet, wasn't very busy but seating was comfortable and open. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night and it was pretty full.  They had this Monday Night special for Burgers $3.75 or a draft for $3.75.  Tried the burger and it was very good but you don't get fries with it.  Still a nice deal.  Also ordered the dessert crepe and the portion is huge, had to share it with someone else or I won't be able to sleep that night cause of all the sugar."}
{"text":"Figures, just as soon as I move away from Oak Ridges a decent spot to sit, have a coffee, while sitting in a comfy chairs a using free WiFi comes to town! Sheesh!  Luckily for me this now makes passing through Oak Ridges a tad more convenient if I'd like to stop and get some work done (and maybe have a coffee and a snack). It's located in the newly minted plaza at Yonge and Regatta (just south of the Medical building (much of this plaza has yet to be filled in with new businesses as of yet so we will see what comes).  I will say that this location is HUGE and it is gorgeous inside to boot! I really had to tilt my head back to take it all in. Quite gorgeous with huge murals on the wall, eclectic decor pieces around on both wall and floor. Definitely a sheik and versatile spot!  Last Monday I paid them a visit shortly after lunch time and decided to have coffee #2 and get some work done. The staff were totally understanding and even extra helpful letting me know where I could find the ONLY plug in the dining room. Note for future visits, my.your laptop best be charged bc if this table is seated you're screwed.  I ordered an Americano (my go to coffee beverage), and while I waited to got the WiFi password and tried logging in. The WiFi here is terrible, so bad in fact that the staff told me before I could even ask if there was an issue, that the WiFi is bad and that Pizza Pizza next door's WiFi is open and MUCH stronger - that's next door though!! You can't advertise Free Wifi and then have said wifi suck? Work on this.  My Americano arrived and the presentation was very nice, I really like the flute-like clear coffee mug. However, the Americano was overly watered and the correct ratio of espresso to water wasn't used, resulting in a sub-par coffee experience. I would have sent it back but I feel like this was the standard offering.  I'll come back because I know that there food (from other locations) is good, and hopefully they fix that WiFi. Believe it or not this is the ONLY coffee shop in the Oak Ridges corridor of Richmond Hill (aside from Tim Hortons)."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been regulars, and avid fans, of Symposium for years.  (Wow, there's a crazy thought.)  So why didn't I review it before?  Because I review everything and I wanted a special place all to myself.  Why am I reviewing it now?  Because I've switched from vegetarian to vegan and there's nothing for me there anymore.    We loved it before it went under it's new management this summer and were a little hesitant to go back afterward, but were pleasantly surprised to see it pretty much stayed the same.  All of our favorite servers were gone, but we were open to a new experience.    The new franchise owner, who to be honest I've only seen in a handful of times (and that's when it first switched management), is fantastic.  He's jolly and responsive and really makes you feel welcome.  When the switch first happened they were really on top of their game, but now I feel that it's mostly gone back to the way it was before, service wise.   The food does come out a lot faster than before, but sometimes easy things (like burgers) are charred and the fries cold.  (What?)  There are a few servers that really rock our world, but there are some that are so neglectful that my husband and I both internally groan when they walk up to our table.  A few times we've flat out gone home when we see they are one of the few working.     I feel like I had to say all this just to justify my four star review, because there was a time I would've given Symposium Cafe five stars without hesitation.    They have a few good vegetarian selections (vegetarian pad thai) and a lot of breakfast foods, but if you're vegan forget it.    Some things to note:   The cinnamon French toast is fabulous, though they've undergone new management they no longer serve the syrup in a jar. It's in packets. (One is never enough.)  Try the spinach dip appetizer thing, it's enough to drive you crazy.   The breakfast foods are fantastic, and they're served all day.   Monday night is burger and draft night.  Burgers are $3.75 (But if you add cheese or fries you have to pay extra. It ends up only being a dollar or two off the normal price, which is $10.)   Tuesday  night is pasta night.  The featured pastas are $9.95, with a weekly changing menu.   Wednesday is martini and mussels, and though we've dined on Wednesdays we've never given this a shot so I'm not sure how they are. Martinis are $4.   Thursday night is date night, which my husband and I used to do before the switch to new management.  The food and selection was fantastic but now they offer mostly chicken dishes (which my husband can't have and I won't have) and stuff that doesn't really appeal to us.  Dinner is $40 and you get appetizers, a main course, sharing a dessert (these things are huge, one is enough for two) and a complimentary coffee or European beverage after the meal.   Friday is wine tasting night and seafood. Saturday is Mojito or Sangria night. (Pitcher for $10 or something.) And Sunday is two for one desserts.   Whew.  How's that for useful?"}
{"text":"Brunch was delicious, staff were friendly and the atmosphere was good. Would definitely go back to this place in the future!"}
{"text":"McDonald's that serves beer! Food and service was terrible. Should have gone to the Corner House who by the way have the better padio or King's Landing who has great food! Won't be back for dessert."}
{"text":"Slow night, not a lot going on there. Order draught beer and a water. Beer is flat. No water. Beer is quickly swapped out for bottle of same. No water. Order flatbread. Flatbread arrives. \"would you like side plates?\". SMH. No water. Flatbread dough is still raw, send back. It comes back soon. Same one. Just heated more. No water. Order a burger to share. Request water again. Burger is pre-fabbed. Only five bucks though. Fries. Pre-fabbed $5.25. Worst service ever, Worst food ever. Won't return."}
{"text":"Our family came here for a late-night dessert and (non-alcoholic) drinks during the Winter break while visiting relatives.  This place blew our socks off!  We ordered several desserts, including the chocolate cheesecake and sky-high carrot cake, with 'steamers'- a delicious steamed-milk drink- one with vanilla and one with hazelnut.  EVERYTHING was delicious.  The restaurant had a nice ambience and was beautiful.  Our server, whose name I didn't catch unfortunately, was the BEST SERVER I've ever encountered... like ever.  He went out of his way to make us feel welcome and even showed my kids to the dessert display. He was a tall, bald, Caucasian fellow with a lovely European accent and friendly smile.  Thank you Symposium for warming up our night while it was -30°C outside!"}
{"text":"It was ok. My daughters French toast had a long black hair hanging from it. My peameal bacon was blue and under cooked. Potatoes are nice and crispy. Garnish lettuce was rusty and wilted. $66 for 3 people to eat breakfast"}
{"text":"Cake, cake, CAKE! Sunday is 2 for 1 cake slices! HELLS YEAH! Know how much I love cake? I've never eaten anything else at this place....until now. I've been to different Symposium locations, but didn't feel it was fair to only blog about one of the many options on their menu!   Breakfast sounds like a good place to start. It was a busy Sunday afternoon when we arrived. The place was stylin' with leather seats and an ancient Greece type theme. Each one I've been to has the same theme, but they're all beautifully designed including the most important feature...the cake display.   We didn't make it past the breakfast menu before we had made our selections. I chose the Tuscan Benedict and my mom chose the Mississippi Benedict. The Tuscan had 3 poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce upon spears of asparagus on toasted English muffins smothered in grated smoked gouda. The Mississippi had 3 poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce upon spears of asparagus laying upon thin crab cakes.   Wow. Just wow. The eggs were perfectly poached and the Hollandaise sauce was rich; not too salty with a hint of sweet. Delish! The smoked gouda made my day! My mom, the seafood queen, was sad the crab cakes were so small, but she still enjoyed the meal. We both polished off all of the breakfast potatoes. Seasoned and addicting! We were both impressed with the quality of the food as well as the presentation.  It's cake time! You will not be disappointed; they have a cake slice for everyone! When you ask your server for cake, they will take you on a CAKE TOUR! I'm not joking! You are guided to the aforementioned cake display case where they name off each cake and you are free to ask questions about them before making your selection. You know how most restaurants have the same desserts? Well, it looks like you have a new dessert addiction to feed (I know I do!). These are not your average cakes. The variety changes often!   Great quality and service! Check it out!"}
{"text":"6 of us arranged a 2pm lunch on May 21st (holiday Monday). We were seated fairly quickly on the patio as per our preference and ordered the Caesars as they were a special price at $5!  Served with a skewer of olives, gherkins and pickled beans we enjoyed the drink appetizers. The Caesars were huge and perfectly prepared!  Lunch was served without delay and we all enjoyed our orders!  Our server was extremely accommodating of a few substitutions and both pleasant and efficient!  I'll admit I have had 2 other experiences that left me thinking I wouldn't be back...but it's apparent they've made some changes since I was there a year ago. Glad my friends convinced me to give Symposium another try!"}
{"text":"I have tried Symposium five-six times now. Every time (besides one) I've just had an issue with the experience, whether it be waiting too long for a waitress, cold food, the food taste/presentation, etc. We did have one waitress that made my breakfast brunch pleasant, but we only went there because we didn't know they didn't serve mimosas until 11am. To be honest, I don't like listening to bad Shakira music at 7am in the morning while trying to eat waffles, and my fiance doesn't enjoy cold eggs. I've wasted too many tries on this place and I am sad to say I feel like I wasted my money. It's a shame, because they have what would be a great menu, and a nice environment. Maybe it just needs better management?"}
{"text":"Symposium is a great and long-needed addition to Oak Ridges. This place has a great atmosphere, a varied and appealing menu and a pretty large patio, which I can't wait for next summer.   My wife and I went there recently for dessert and we were not disappointed. We shared an \"East Meets West\" waffle and, wow, the plate was so large we couldn't finish it! It was presently beautifully. I also ordered a latte which was, well, it was a latte, so not too many places can get that wrong.  Overall I'm very happy we (Oak Ridges) finally have something a little more upscale, while being more affordable than Sarpa up the road, to help give our nice little town more variety.  Welcome to the neighbourhood, Symposium! Hope you stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I go here often when I visit my friend in Georgetown and I love it! The only reason it loses a star is because last time, we asked for mayo to be put on the burger and we were given attitude from the server with her saying \"Can't you do it yourself?\"..."}
{"text":"Been there a lot over past year for breakfast and it's good. Just wish the pea-meal bacon was consistent. Sometimes it's thin, overcooked, and dry, and that's enough for us to look elsewhere. But I'll give it another try and say something to them next time."}
{"text":"I visited Symposium last weekend as a friend wanted to check out the 2 for 1 cake promo they offer on Sundays.  it was Civic Holiday weekend and the patio was maxed out, but just under half full inside, which should have been the first warning.  Our waiter was a fellow by the name of Omar, or at least that's what the receipt stated. He was very rushed and didn't seem to know what he was doing. He took my friends to the cake display and they decided on their cakes. For whatever reason, he seemed to ignore another friend and I because we decided to order off the menu since we had not eaten dinner. I ordered the Gourmet Cheese Burger, my friend ordered the Symposium Burger. Once I ordered, explaining twice what I wanted and which cheese, he returned within 2 minutes to ask again which item I ordered. He then left before we could also ask to order a beer to drink.  When he returned with our food, my friend was finally able to order a Sapporo. The issue with that? Omar said \"sure\" and never bothered to ask if he wanted a bottle or if he wanted a glass and what serving size... I just skipped the beer once ain't realized the server seemed to want to half ass the service. The beer arrived in a glass and was told by my friend that there was no carbonation and it was almost sour. This guy is a beer lover and always gives me great recommendations since I know nothing about beer, so it's not as if he just didn't like it.  The food itself was just below average. The burger was frozen at some point and the fries had soaked up all the oil they were fried in, very soft.  My other friend ordered a slice of lemon cake, and said that the cake had no taste of lemon whatsoever.  I've been told that this was an exception and not the rule from what Symposium generally offers it's customers at other location but definitely disappointing.  In all with tip, $17 bucks for a burger, sigh.  We were also looking for salt shakers for our fries, however, there was not a single shaker on any of the tables in our proximity and our server didn't return until we were done eating. However, the manager was very friendly when he came over to touch the table, so that earns a 2nd star!"}
{"text":"I came across this place just by searching \"cafe\" around me on google maps for a place to study and it lead me here. So far to say I have no regrets :)  Quick Review (With Studying in Mind) -Has Free Wifi -Refillable Coffee -2 Wall Plugs that I could find   This review will pertain to my visit on the earliest mornings of a weekday with the intent to study. Ill be honest, my experience was fantastic although the place does not look like place for study. Symposium comes across more like a restaurant with a European/Italian decor. The restaurant also has a patio.  For studying wise, I came at a time where it was quiet and took 1 of 2 wall plugs (all I could quickly find) in the restaurant. The restaurant has free Wifi and had background music was a little loud for studying but easily fixable putting on earphones. I stayed a total of 5 hours and the staff was extremely kind with coffee refills and giving water when I didn't even ask for it (it was like they read my mind at that moment when I needed water).   During my stay here, I basically ordered coffee (Free Refills btw) and a Breakfast Cuban Sandwich that came with Home fries. The Cuban Sandwich was a great pick me up for the amount of studying I had to get up to. It consisted of Pulled pork, fried egg, peameal bacon, sliced pickles, mustard and swiss cheese served on a ciabatta bun which comes to $7.95.  Overall I really enjoyed my visit and would happily come again to study here if it isn't that busy and try the other dishes they have to offer. (was told that it could get busy depending on the day)"}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst meal I have eaten in years.   I had the chicken souvlaki dinner which was under seasoned rubbery chicken and a side of souvlaki with no garlic.   My husband had the jack Daniels steak which was overcooked and smothered in a sickeningly sweet sauce.   Perhaps their breakfast and deserts are good but quite frankly I've lost my appetite.  I would advise against eating dinner here."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this restaurant. The waitstaff are not friendly and the menu is not great. They do not accommodate anyone with food allergies. I'm both lactose and gluten intolerant and the only beverage I can purchase is tea. How difficult is it for a restaurant to purchase a milk alternative?  In addition to the above, this location does not carry any lactose & gluten free desserts. I find this ridiculous. If you are a cafe, I honestly think you should have options available for people with food allergies or intolerances."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  I've been to two other Symposium locations and have always had a wonderful time. I had no idea this location existed until today. I am so glad I discovered it.   The breakfast was delicious and it is served all day!  That is a huge plus since most places stop serving breakfast around noon.   The ambiance is also really nice. This location is much bigger than the Vaughan location, which is a nice plus.   You won't have to wait long to be seated and the employees are very friendly. They also have lactose and gluten free options.   I will definitely be back. : )"}
{"text":"Clean friendly atmosphere. The staff was really friendly. Food comes in generous proportions and the price point makes this an overall good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and had some interesting experiences on both sides of the spectrum. Third time however hastened my decision to not recommend this place for a lunch.  The first and second visits here were fine. I've only come here during work lunches with groups of 6-10 but it was never really busy. The staff were courteous and welcoming and though the wait time for the food was a little slow, we were still able to finish our meal and head out within an hour.   My third visit here was typical: mid-afternoon with little traffic and quiet. Majority of people were there for drinks however my party of 8 were hoping for a repeat of the previous visits. Everything was fine until after our drinks were taken; they were made and left on the counter where our waiter who was nowhere in sight. 15 minutes later it was finally brought over and we selected from the menu. After that we waited for 40 minutes with no hint that the food was coming. Our waiter rarely appeared and when he finally did during our wait, he had to ask the manager for the whereabouts of our food. 10 minutes later, voila! All 8 dishes arriving except there was problem; the mushroom swiss burger that I ordered was burnt to a crisp on the bottom. Around the table, 2 other people in my party had burnt chicken in their caesar chicken wrap. I could go longer with the other two who ordered a meal with meat but my review would be pages long. Showing the waiter our well below-par food, he got the manager to have a look and diagnosed my burger as  \"a little burnt\" but was happy to change it for me; it took another 10 minutes. Meanwhile the others with the chicken caesar wraps had their change requests rebuffed. In the end they removed my burger from the bill but the manager's poor customer service when clearing our plates (didn't bother asking if we wanted doggy bags for uneaten food) finalized my decision to never come here again.  To sum it up, the waiter was nervous though it wasn't entirely his fault, the cook rushed our food which is probably why it was burnt, and the manager was not courteous."}
{"text":"I'm not big on franchise restaurants but this place wasn't bad. They were able to accomodate 7 of us pretty quickly even those the place was busy. Food was nothing special. We were there for brunch so started with caesars which were great. I had an omelette, the egss a little overdone but the ingredients were tasty. We had hot wings, which were pretty good and the smoked salmon benedict was ok. Seriously, food was just ok, we didn't walk out blown away. But honestly, we were just looking for a place to get the family together. Not interested in returning."}
{"text":"Service Nothing out of the ordinary for the service, in fact our waiter was quite friendly. Not much to say here.  Food Where do I even begin? It is so disappointing that a restaurant that looks so nice serves such lackluster food. We went on a Thursday night so the special was $50 for a three-course meal for 2 individuals. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal except the food didn't meet any of our expectations. For the appetizers my boyfriend got a caesar salad which was pretty average but my cup of soup had too much salt and I was quenched. Moving onto the main dishes, I had some kind of steak paired with potatoes and veggies. Having bok choy as a side is not very impressive and the steak was heavily seasoned to the point where I couldn't tell if the meat was actually fresh or not. The potatoes were fine. My boyfriend got a seafood pasta but it was quite spicy. The dish itself was fine but the spiciness overpowered the taste of the seafood. We ordered tea later on and was disappointed again that they use Tetley's....I thought only diners use that brand. I was clearly expecting a little more. I had high hopes for the dessert and chose the carrot cake. It wasn't bad, it was moist, but the flavour was forgettable."}
{"text":"Have heard mixed reviews about Symposium from friends, so didn't know what to expect.   Ended up going on a pasta night, so we had a pasta bowl for $12.99. Wasn't the best pasta I've had, but wasn't bad either. I had the Fusilli with Chicken and Artichoke, and my brother had Penne with Bacon and Asparagus.  Service wasn't all that great, as our server didn't seem to want to be there. Took a while to just get water, he seemed apathetic, and couldn't even wave him down to get the bill... Kinda ruined the overall experience, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I have to say that the service of this place is excellent. The waiters, waitresses, and staff who served us were polite and attentive. It was a great brunch, catching up with a friend, and the food was delicious! Had the eggs benny (yum)! Would come back for brunch again!"}
{"text":"When we walked in for brunch, they were at about 50% capacity so we were seated right away. The menu was impressive with a wide selection.   Be warned that the service is terrible. I have been told by others that the service is bad but the delicious food made up for it. I'm always up for giving a new place a chance!  I ordered the Eggs Provencal (one of the Benedict options) and substituted the ham for peameal bacon. Once we ordered, it took a while before we were served our drinks. Whenever we needed anything from our server (like cutlery), there was a lot of waiting around and constantly glancing to see where she was. I would expect that if it was more busy but it wasn't at all.  The food was really good, especially the potatoes. My meal came with 3 poached eggs. As I was finishing up my second poached egg, I noticed a hair in my food. So I waited and waited for our server to come around so I could show her and give her a heads up to let her staff know. The first thing she said to me was: \"Ew, don't eat it.\" Umm.. thanks I wasn't going to... It was the most bizarre reaction. She didn't say \"I'm sorry about that..\" or \"I will inform my manager right away.\" etc... or anything that indicated she was trained for her job. All she said was \"Ew, don't eat it.\" And when I put my fork down, she asked if I wanted my plate cleared, to which I responded \"Yes, thanks.\"  I sat there, sipping on my mimosa, while the rest of my table finished their food.   The server did not acknowledge what happened again until she brought our bills and said to me \"I didn't charge you for your meal.\" Again, I just responded \"Thanks.\" I was just in shock by how she handled the situation. It's great that they comp'ed my meal, don't get me wrong! But how the situation handled was just awful and for that, I will not be visiting any Symposium Cafe locations ever. GROSS."}
{"text":"I have been to lounges that had a better atmosphere than this one. I must say the customer service is very choosy with different kinds of people, I mean this was my first and my last time I would every lounge drink and a appetizer. Not only the service was poor and the food was probably why I gave it two stars. I mean I can buy a frozen food and it would taste better than what I try to enjoy to eat.   I know there are better places to lounge and relax than this place. Please can their management step it up for 2018!   If you agree than you know this review deserves two stars or maybe even none!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright. I was hesitant to visit after seeing the lackluster reviews for the Oak Ridges location closer to home, but gave in at the urging of a friend - no regrets though, always up for something new and this wasn't bad!   First, service - our waiter was present throughout our dinner and seemed nice. No real complaints there! The decor wasn't quite my style but that's fine, I came to eat :) The menu is truly extensive and I appreciated that it provided caloric info for every dish (I was mildly horrified that the pastas I usually opt for elsewhere were close to 1,500 calories! :0) I went for a grilled vegetable flatbread ($14 and change pre tax/tip), which was fine for a light dinner and tasted pretty good (if you like goat cheese, it's a nice choice) despite its less exciting appearance/presentation. I'm not entirely sure it was made fresh, but the taste was fine. My friend worked through a giant vegetarian pad thai with remarkable speed, indicating to me that it was a decent choice (approx $15). Overall, I found Symposium to be okay."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on the weekend. Place reminds me of a nice coffee joint. Nice intimate place. Large floor to ceiling windows around to let the light in, really bright with the sunlight. The floors were a bit dirty, didn't know if it was just a bad time.  Ordered the 3 eggs with farmers sausage. Comes with little fried potato bits, mini fries or \"hashbrown\". They were okay, I didn't really want fried potatoes though. Also come with your choice of white, whole wheat or rye bread. I had the rye bread, it was pretty good and fresh. I ordered scrambled eggs it was average, decent, edible. Was quite disappointed with the farmers sausage, it looked good, it was quite big. However, when I bit into it, it was basically full of fat bits and lacked flavour, basically tasted like fried long tube of fat.   Overall, I thought the service was pretty good. The servers were attentive and courteous. However the place needed a bit of cleaning, even in the washrooms."}
{"text":"Came in for a late night dessert with some friends, our server Garry was great and knowledgeable about the menu. The fudge brownie cheesecake was excellent and very filling and the prices were ok at around $7-9."}
{"text":"Went for a date night with my husband and it was not great.   I ordered the turkey bacon club house with Greek salad. It was ok, I was disappointed that the turkey wasn't freshly roasted. It tasted like turkey deli slices. I liked the Greek salad.   My husband ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and after his first bite he could tell it was made from a frozen burger patty (which one of the staff members confirm). He was hungry so he ate the burger but he didn't enjoy it at all.   We appreciated that the burger was taken off our bill as we told them it wasn't necessary.. I think they could tell how much he didn't like his burger.  Summary: we wouldn't go back but the restaurant was busy and seems to get good reviews (not really sure why)."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a bunch of times and never had a bad meal. It's a very interesting atmosphere - different from any other restaurants I've been too. Each day they have some sort of drink or food special. Sunday are the best for 2 for 1 cake ;)! My favourite menu items include the chicken wraps, flat breads, salads and obviously all of the cakes. The have amazing speciality coffees and cappuccinos as well!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the atmosphere is pretty nice and spacious, but the manager and server is a bit low ended. So apparently you are suppose to walk up to the dessert showcase, and someone is supposedly tell you the desserts and their names. Standing there for a couple of minutes and the manager just thought we were invisible or something. Mind you three of us were standing up there and only one table was on the floor, still no service was given! Then we all sat down and the waiter ask have you picked your dessert yet ... and were all like no, cause no one cared to talk to us. Like Wow!!! this is how you treat your customers, ignore them !!"}
{"text":"Flatbread appetizer was great as was my Tilapia entre and dessert.  We'll definitely go again and recommend tgis restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Server was nice but the food took forever and desert took even longer.  Don't know if I'll come back."}
{"text":"I met my friend here. It was her suggestion to come to Symposium. I liked the customer service. The special was fish and chips. It was just k for haddock but not my favorite fish. Would I go back?  Yes I would try it again. Just a different item on the menu"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Everyone was extremely happy with what they ordered. Server was friendly, funny and efficient. Price wasn't too bad"}
{"text":"The restaurant looked great , clean and tidy. Server was friendly and very welcoming. Food was above average in terms of desert."}
{"text":"Not enough wait staff at this location on a weekend. We went for dessert and coffee. They have lactose free milk options. Caramel brownie was very tasty but I would recommend getting it with ice cream if you want a bit moist of a brownie. Latte and cappuccino were good but we've had better at other places."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating going to try this place out for the longest time and to put things simply, it was quite a disappointment.. I had high expectations for this place since I was surprised with the decor and atmosphere from the moment I walked in. It's really unfortunate that it was this location I went to; it was evident they had a number of new hires and so they were busier than I'd usually expect for a Thursday night. I ordered their spicy garlic mussels that were on special for 10.95 which were okay and their \"signature\" 10 oz. new York steak which was mediocre.. The server paid absolutely no attention to us since we were sat in a corner.. 2 people at a large booth meant for 4. When he finally got around to us for dessert menus, the carrot cake which was another one of their \"signature\" dishes wasn't even available.. So I settled for a strawberry shortcake. The overall presentation wasn't that great... Syrup sloppily poured over the plate. Like pancakes. Needless to say, the icing on the cake was stale. Gross. Bill came to about $60 and it was totally not worth it. Before leaving I paid a visit to the restrooms and they haven't renovated it since lick's.. Ugh. It looks like a diner in there. I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I like Symposium, it reminds me of the smaller version of The Cheesecake Factory. Great selection of desserts, and I can't complain about their breakfast either. Service is a hit and miss but this hasnt stopped me from coming back."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night for dinner and dessert and got instead empty stomach and bad service.  First arrive sign says please wait to be seated.  Waited 5 minutes and sat ourselves, the start of bad service  .  My girlfriend and I was hungry and ordered Caesar salad with grilled chicken sandwich and I with soup and grilled pesto grilled chicken sandwich.  Cannot give a review since it took 45 minutes and we walked out.  The manager said they are short staffed but had many servers standing around and perhaps no kitchen staff.  Manager said good would come out in 10 minutes but 45 minutes went by so we split.  Don't go back unless you enjoy bad service!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this chain of cafes is the top-notch service from everyone, even if it's a busy day or stressed. In the case of the latter, our waitress was pulled away from us due to another situation and a nearby waiter was assigned to my table, and he was instantly all charm. Food was good as always, though the waffles in my Breakfast Of Champions were a little cold by the time it got to me. Was also a little long before the food got here."}
{"text":"I really dislike this chain for many reasons. It's part café, part restaurant, part breakfast place, all confusion. I really hate how the menu exemplifies this also. There's no real theme to this place other than \"everything you want all in one place\". Anything from butter chicken to waffles. Since the kitchen is cooking all these wildly different foods, on the same pans, for years, everything tastes the same. Everything has that \"Symposium\" flavour to it. Very bland and nothing special. There is nothing that I would specifically come here for, besides the cakes. Especially since there are way better restaurants around. The servers are very fast, professional, and sociable.   The decor is depressing at night and I would recommend staying away as it literally looks like a crypt inside except in the morning/ during the day."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night and went mainly because of their cakes. The cakes seem very fresh and are very delicious and not insanely sweet. We tried the red velvet, the cake with hundreds of chocolate layers, the baileys cheesecake and another one. Most of it is not on the menu as it may change. We had a few good coffee drinks and shakes. The butter chicken was alright.  The location in Ajax and on Yonge are pretty cozy so it's a good place to hang out for coffee or maybe drinks, too. I can't say much about their food.  Great cake though!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice place.  Ordered chocolate sundae very boring & plain, coffee was cold and tasteless.  Fried ordered waffle which was hard.  Very disappointed, likely won't go back."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Symposium in Waterloo all the time when I was still in University. So I was pretty pumped when work suggested going to Symposium for a team breakfast! We went on a Friday morning at 830. The restaurant was around 70% full, there were two other big groups, and a few smaller groups. The first thing I noticed was that there seemed to be only one waiter serving the entire restaurant. He was the only one running around bringing out people's order, and we had to wait a while before getting seated. Once my entire group arrived, that waiter came by our table to apologize for the slow service. He was actually the manager, and one of his staff apparently didn't show up for work that morning. I thought it was a very nice gesture of him to come apologize and explain the situation. However, the slow service was a bit annoying, as a few of us had meetings in the morning we had to get back to work for. Once we placed our orders, the food took around 20 minutes to come out. We were a group of 10, and the food all came out at the same time, which was good.  I ordered a hot chocolate and French toast with Chantilly cream and crushed Oreos. Both items were presented very nicely. The French toast portion was huge; it came with 3 slices of toast (all cut in half), with a very generous amount of Oreo toppings, and Chantilly cream (on the side), two slices of bacon (or you can choose ham instead), and a nice bowl of fruits. The taste however was very average. I mean you can't really go wrong with French toast slathered in syrup and cream! Unfortunately, my breakfast this time wasn't as good as what I remembered from my university days."}
{"text":"My sister and I came into Symposium Cafe today and we were delighted to see practically a full house! Such a nice, comfortable vibe, even as patrons were buzzing about in their own conversations. Our server was great! She seated us in comfy chairs near the patio so we got a lot of great natural light as we dined. We both ordered the Eggs Benedict and at first glance, the portion looked smaller than what we were used to (we can both eat a generous amount), but surprisingly we were full and satisfied. The only thing I would recommend is to serve fresh fruits with the entree. That would be perfecto! We both enjoyed our meals and the service and will certainly come back. I'm already thinking how perfect this space is for a launch party (they have liquor AND dessert) or an awesome birthday event. Love the ambience and service, chilled out and attentive. Food had just the right amount of flavour. I'm sure their drinks are just as good! Ordered a Symposium Iced Mochaccino to go and I would recommend without the whip cream- it was a bit too rich for me. Hope you all try out this Cafe and have a great meal there as well! Looking forward to my next visit :)"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. I've been to other locations and never had a problem. This location should seriously reevaluate their management. We came for Mother's Day and it was the worst mistake ever. First they didn't let us sit because they said they claimed they didn't use OpenTable even though I arranged it through OpenTable and had proof of everything. Not too sure how anyone else is getting their table if they don't even take reservations. Then they finally made room, which was nice, but we were forced to wait an hour and a half to eat. An hour in they brought my mom and grandmother food and then after they already put their forks in the food, they realized it wasn't for them and they took it away and gave it to the other table! We were about to walk out and go somewhere else to eat when they finally started to SLOWLY brought out everyone's food, but each of us had to wait 5 minutes each from the person before us to get our plate. I had to get up and go to the kitchen and ask for hot sauce because by the time they would have come, I would have been finished eating. Never ever coming back. I'm disgusted in this place."}
{"text":"A bit pricy for what is it. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and the outdoor patio is really nice in the summer. I usually get the veggie wrap which is $12, which is one of the cheapest items on the menu. I would recommend this restaurant for sure though because I find the good tasty."}
{"text":"The staff were very nice, the service was great. i had icecream parfait and it was nothing special. Totally, good place for chit chat."}
{"text":"Go for drinks to enjoy some rare ambiance in Mississauga. Do not go for food.  This place is clearly well managed but the food is sub par. First we ordered a duo platter of bruschetta and chicken tenders. While the presentation was lovely I was turned off by a side dip that looked like orange Vaseline. The chicken was so crunchy on the outside that I figured it had been under a heat lamp for hours. The cheese on top of the bruschetta had solidified leading me to believe it had also been prepared hours before.  So then we both ordered crepes. Again, lovely presentation but the crepes were cold! I've never had a cold crepe before. This one tasted like rubber and had clearly been around for awhile.  A lovely manager stopped by to ask how everything was and we told her the crepes were terrible. She kindly comped them and explained that the waffles were made in-house so we should order them next time.  I don't think there will be a 'next time.' Great service, atmosphere, but terrible food.  Skip."}
{"text":"this place is really close to us.  unfortunately its not on our places to go.  the price does not match its quality.  I'd rather go to any other pub. jackastors, Boston pizza, and etc"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I ever experienced in my life. I can't really judge the customer service because I wasn't even served. Sat there for 15-20 minutes without anyone coming to take my order while customers who came after me were served right away. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I went to symposium on Valentine's Day. Was very disappointed with the food. Especially the valentine special. First of all, the roasted red pepper bisque soup tasted terrible. It feels like I'm drinking tomato sauce. The surf and turf was really bad too, the server didn't even asked me how I wanted the steak. I told him afterward that I wanted medium rare, but when it came, it was barely cooked. I guess the only good thing was the dessert which was chocolate stuffed cookie. That dessert alone would be 2 stars. Would only recommend to go for the dessert. That's it"}
{"text":"Not expecting the best, and I wasn't disappointed. Appetizer was good, steak was bad, and drinks were sub par.   Desert was huge, but overall this place is less than it tries t"}
{"text":"I'm always a bit hesitant to try franchised restaurant concepts like Symposium Cafe that attempt an upscale dining experience. Typically over priced and with subpar food quality I will nearly always avoid them. But with someone else paying and an invite, how bad can Symposium be?  Seated upon arrival in a half empty dining room, our party combed the menu's many options. Greek salad or Pad Thai? Burgers or maybe the seafood pasta? Confused on the menu's direction, I finally settled for the blackened Tilapia with rice and seasonal veggies. When asked about said vegetables our server was unable to tell me what they would be. I ended up waiting until my plate came to find out the answer.  The Tilapia was cold, mushy and flavorless when it arrived. Its accompanying rice was unbelievably starchy and clumped together. \"Is this instant rice?\" I remember thinking.  As for the seasonal vegetables, they were no more than over-steamed carrots and broccoli. Completely flavorless and not worth eating.  Pushing back my plate I began thinking about where I could go after we had all finished to get something good to eat."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday breakfast after walking out of The Original Sunnyside Grill after being ignored for 10 minutes.  Service was absolutely fantastic!  Ordered breakfast and it was also great!  Food quality is high and prices are reasonable.  They have a 2 4 1 dessert special on Sundays...  Must try it one day!"}
{"text":"This is the third Symposium Cafe I've been to and service has always been an issue. Service is always so slow! We waited very long to get our food, very long to get coffee refills, and very long to get our bill. I'm just not impressed. In addition to that, I had eggs and waffles and my eggs didn't taste or have the texture of scrambled eggs - it was like the eggs you get at McDonalds when you order a big breakfast. I'd prefer to not go back but somehow my friends usually choose to meet at a Symposium Cafe for brunch - likely for convenience of location vs the food and service."}
{"text":"Went on a regular Sunday for lunch and even though there were empty tables we had to wait 25 mins before getting seated. Presentation of food and taste of food was just average. Nothing great to comment about. slow service (took about 40 mins for our brunch to arrive). I wouldnt come back here as I dont see any reason that would compel me to."}
{"text":"Symposium is a new store that recently opened up in the Yonge and Finch area. It is decorated nicely with plenty of options on their food and drink menu. The service was great because we were the only table there which is the case most of the time...  Symposium is what I call a \"confused\" restaurant. I really do not know if it is trying to be a bar, breakfast joint, evening supper place, or something in between.  They serve breakfast until 4pm and have some fine wines along with your typical beer selections and hard liqour.  Their menu has a Plethora of items...everything from Pasta, Steak, Burgers, Desserts, Salads, Chicken Fingers...basically they have everything on their menu.  In my humble opinion, this restaurant needs a Menu makeover and stick to one or two things and do them very very well.   I usually always order their burgers because they are really delicious and you get a lot of meat with the Burger. For $14.95...it better be good.  My friends order salmon, steak, and dessert.  All of the food is delicious... however... the vibe and atmosphere of this place is oddly confusing.   Regardless, come here in your dress clothes, sweats, or jeans and I am sure you will enjoy the food and drinks!"}
{"text":"The service was awful.  The waiters not familiar with how to deal with costumers at all. The cake was not delicious, the tea was in a tea bag. It was my friends birthday and they did not have a decent candle. We ordered cajun dusted shrimp which was oily and not well prepared.  Overall never go there."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Don't expect a culinary experience.  Expensive for what you get.  My wife and I have been to Symposium twice.  Both times, it was busy, which is usually a really good sign of a great restaurant.  However, Symposium isn't busy because it's good; it's busy because there isn't any competition for this class of restaurant in Georgetown.  For the bedroom community that Georgetown is known as, one would expect a range of medium class restaurants for folks who pay 500k on a house to enjoy.  Symposium benefits from this by being one of the only dimly lit, seemingly quaint restaurants within a 10 minute drive of the city core.  The trouble with Symposium is that it's \"just ok\".  The laminated, pedestrian menu is what you can find at any chain restaurant.  The service is slightly overworked and spotty at best.  The prices are slightly more than what you would expect to pay for the quality of the food.  My wife and I might find ourselves here again.  However, it will only be as a result of the lack of options in the area."}
{"text":"We had a chance to have dinner here yesterday night. The place wasn't too busy so we were able to be seated as we walked in. The waiter bought over the menus and we decided to share the Pepper Glazed Chicken. They did have $5.95 Martinis that night so we both got one. Alcapulao Martini and Mango Passion. About 15 mins after our food arrived, looking at the plate it was a lot of food for one person. Thankfully we split it. The chicken and rice tasted great, as well as the martini. We had heard there Chocolate Cheesecake was really good so we ordered one to share. The Cheesecake tasted amazing. On a side note, the portions are really big so I was recommend sharing."}
{"text":"TLDR: the manager came to my table to address me what medium rare meant unknowing im a previous michelin star chef?? It was raw and looked like a burnt carpet on the outside.  Disgusting Muscles, burnt bread, dry chicken and a steak obviously cooked on a dirty grill that seemed like it was never cleaned before.  Actually blown away by how awful this place became over the years.. i used to love coming to symposium of a nice beer and muscles but HOLY nearly everything was bad and only things that werent bad were obviously not made in house.  Food: 1.5/5 Service: 2/5 Ambience: 3/5 Price: 2/5  Food: edible, not enjoyable and the least questionable for the sanitation. Muscles tasted dead before cooking, it reaked. The bread with spinach dip was plated well but the bread was obviously burnt on the buttom and flipped over so we wouldnt notice. THE STEAK had to be the weirdest looking steak, it was so broken smother in this sweet bottled barbeque sauce, with a side of bok choy??? The worst part had to be the absolutely VILE burnt outer edges.  The ONLY THING that was good was the dessert and that was all.  Service: The servers were nice, though they rarely ever came back? The restaurant was nearly completly empty yet the couldnt come back every couple minutes or so. So we would finish out apps before they would know something was an issue.   Ambience: completly empty restaurant on a saturday, what does that tell you? It was okay.   Price: NOT worth it for the quality you pay. If they are serving butter chicken next to your steak it tells you that they dont prioritize the quality of each dish but to entice as many customers as possible.   Overall ill never come back to symposium, its not worth betting that theyll fix their menu or service or staff if their menu has been the same for over 3 years. Theyve finally lost a returning customer."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch last week the food was alright. The service was very slow and we ended up staying there for more than two hours. I asked fo orange juice and I wasn't told that we get charged for it so I ended up paying $5 for a cup of orange juice... Totally not worth it. However, the dessert was very good"}
{"text":"Beautiful Restaurant ... My husband and I had ordered chicken and meat loaf on Thursday  I think from the dinner for two menu and it was absolutely  delicious...however the regular menu we ordered from at our last visit was very dissapointing!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good at all. The salad was overdressed, sesame wrap was not flavourful .The Thai chicken was moist, but tasteless. The white wine was not cold enough.  It smells like artificial flavourings and cleaning agents, when you walk in the front door.   The restaurant is also very loud, so it's hard to carry on a conversation.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and the service took forever, our waitress wasn't the nicest, and the food wasn't even good. I ordered a smoothie, 20 mins later, after she was finished her conversation with a coworker.. the waitress starts making the smoothie . I definitely won't be coming back there.. I've worked in a busy restaurant in NYC for 4 years... this place could use a little bit of work to say the least. Waitresses need to be monitored so that they're actually doing their jobs. My friend and I both weren't pleased with our dishes.  I won't be coming back.  A nice perk is the outdoor seating- we just happened to be there on a chilly evening so we ended up sitting inside ."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend to study. I called in and spoke to the manager Zacky in the morning asking if we could come in for breakfast at 11:15 or 11:30 since we were in class and going to miss breakfast which ends at11. He agreed. We got there and he personally helped to set up some seats for us in the beautiful patio where there was an outlet for our laptops.   Our server was Jessica. Probably one of the BEST servers I've ever had. She was nice, personable and not annoying (didn't come to check up on us more than needed).   We ordered the Eggs Benjamin with home fries. It was made to perfection as always. The home fries were fresh not hard, brittle or cold.  I also ordered the Cesar which was on special which didn't taste the best nor was the presentation off the hook. They didn't beat Jack Astors.   We were out there for about 3 hours and they came to tell us that it was about to rain. They seemed more worried about our laptops and electronics than us! They arranged for a corner seat inside for us that was secluded a little with yet another outlet!!! YES THEY ARE AMAZING.   We left after a total of 4-5 hours and no complaints from them. Talk about AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Well the food was a great disappointments. Ordered the Belgian waffle.  The pic on the menu looked delicious but unfortunately the actual food was not even close.   The waffles were not at all yummy and I had like 6 pieces of strawberry on on waffles.  The only good thing was the bowl of fresh fruit.  The mango juice was supposed to be freshly squeezed but it tasted a lot like boxed juice.  A big disappointment in terms of food. Service was great though. Our waitress was attentive and came over few times to ask us if everything was good and if we needed anything else.   Great place to come to except the food is not the best."}
{"text":"pretty good breakfast,service is slow. nice big patio but in a busy parking lot."}
{"text":"never ever go there unless you want to drink beer/alcohol. Scrambled eggs tasted cottony. Bacon was like Cardpaper"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, desert selection and coffees! The perfect spot to chill with friends."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, lots of selection. Just had a really long day, popped in at 10:00 pm to order food to go, was sitting and waiting for my food and the gentleman working brought me a fresh coffee. Wanted to take a second to mention it. Good people, good food."}
{"text":"We were seated on the patio, our server never came to ask us what we wanted to drink even. However she was cleaning tables. We waited 30 min (I was watching the time), then we walked out."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. They quickly sat us and our waiter was great. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly!  We got the crab cakes for an appetizer, and they were soooo delicious. I have never had crab cakes before, but I have been craving these since! Definitely getting some next time I get back. For my meal, I got the crispy chicken wrap with a tomato vegetable soup. It was delicious!  Overall we received great service, the restaurant was very nice, and the food was delicious. I will definitely be returning with my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. If you have to go to Symposium, go to the other locations. Came here for brunch since it was close by. Thought it would be full because of labour day Monday, so we went in to realize it was half empty. Waited there for 5-7 minutes and then the hostess tells me they're cleaning the tables. So we waited another minute to be seated, then got our menus. Looked through the menu and was ready to order, only to realize we had to wait another 5 minutes for our server to come over and ask what we wanted to drink (I thought water was pretty standard when they come over). So we ordered and waited another 5 minutes for my pint, another 35 minutes and still no food. I got pissed, chugged my beer and cancelled the rest of the crap we ordered. I paid for the beer without tipping, perhaps I should've drank it and left without paying.  Its simple - if you can't serve promptly, take a damn day off. I was h-angry!"}
{"text":"really nice atmosphere! food was good! drinks were amazing!! Really worth the drive for!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  The first time although I ordered their SIGNATURE New York Steak and it took them THREE attempts to make my medium rare steak, I decided to give them a second chance.  So this time I decided to try their breakfast : Choice of Champion.  Let me tell you,  this is anything BUT champion.  It included 3 eggs (I asked for over easy), your choice of bacon and ham (I chose bacon), a Belgian waffle, potatoes hash and a little garnish on the side.  How could a breakfast go wrong I asked myself and YES!  It did.  The eggs were over cooked, the yolk was rock solid!  So I asked them to remake it and it was STILL over cooked!  The egg yolks were barely runny!  Even 1* is too much to give.  This is the last time I'm going there!"}
{"text":"I love the decor. I liked my meal. Ordered a milkshake got a smoothy but I don't mind. The busboy was heading towards me with my drink and got stopped by the waiter. When she came back my drink now had a little milk in it and some whipped cream on the top but still tasted like a smoothy."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab drink on a Friday or Sunday night with a great selection of cocktails as well as appetizers and pizzas.   If you need an espresso or latte with some dessert in the morning its also great for that. The crowd is mostly young except for the mornings where it's a big mesh of all ages."}
{"text":"It's very nice inside and comfy. But one time we went and they were playing music so loud that we couldn't even talk:( the foods okay but there dessert menus is good and same with their coffee. I don't personally like there food."}
{"text":"I live in the area and manage a restaurant 5 minutes down the road so needless to say I always want to give this place the benefit of the doubt. However, every time I come here they cannot seem to get it right. Service is lacklustre and food is mediocre at best.   Came here with my mom for brunch around 6 months ago and ordered a mimosa. After being ID'd by a server who was CLEARLY new and realizing I only had my health card to prove my age (23) which is completely legal if offered by the guest, I was still denied the beverage. After asking to speak to the manager (at this point I didn't care about the drink it was the principle) twice who did not show up, I decided to give up on the task at hand. What kind of manager/ owner doesn't show up to the table when summoned by the guest?!  Both times I've been here for breakfast it has been wrong. Asked for poached eggs hard, they come out soft and then take another 10 minutes to come out and then of course the rest of my breakfast is cold. I can go on forever but you get the point. If I come back it will be because a friend suggests it and I will only get the coffee."}
{"text":"Overall, restaurants in Stouffville is great but except this one, Symposium--;;sorry...all the foods are not good...not fresh...pasta was overcooked....it's like a fast food or frozen....I was very disappointed..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and so far both experiences were great. I like the fact that it's so convenient, within a 1 min walk from where I live so I could stumble here anytime!  This cafe used to be a Macs convenience store but they renovated it nicely as the dining area has lots of tables, full size bar and even a patio which is nice to enjoy on a hot summer day.  The first time I came here I ordered the chicken wrap. It was very decent as the portion was massive so I was pretty satisfied. My friend and I also ordered the fruit crepe which was also light and delicious. The last time I was here, I just came for a hot beverage and decided to try their chai tea latte. I was pretty impressed as it was made perfectly, probably even better than Starbucks' latte which I also love. The prices of the hot drinks are also comparable to the local coffee competitors in the area.  Another great thing about this resto cafe is that they also offer daily specials such as Pasta Night or Mussels Night. A good idea to save a little cash!  Parking is not as accessible because you can either park on the street or in the parking lot on Parkview Avenue but there may not be spots available since it usually gets busy with other local eateries in the area. However, it's about a 3-4 min walk from North York Station.  You can come here late night on weekends as they close at 2am.  So go here if you're craving a delicious hot beverage or dessert!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and will keep coming back.  The host at the front desk asked if we prefer a booth or a table since both were available.  I like that.  The server was very fast at taking our drinks order, returning with the drinks and taking our food order.  The menu has a wide range of choices.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The decor is nice and there's adequate parking including spots on the side and back of the building.  The new manager sometimes comes by to chat.  He is clearly proud of the business and enjoys what he does."}
{"text":"Been to several Symposium locations, but the best one I've been to, hands-down, is the Markham locations at Kennedy and Major Mackenzie.  Before I moved to Toronto (from Markham), Symposium Cafe in Markham was my go-to spot for late night eats and drinks -- but today, I decided to head over for their 2-for-1 cake slice special on Sundays!   The staff has changed since the last time I visited the establishment, but the manager (or supervisor -- not too sure) was very good.  He made sure that all customers were attended to and that the service provided was efficient and friendly (even though he was busy training new employees as well).  In addition to the good service, the cakes were delicious.  From the Hummingbird to the Brownie Chocolate Cheesecake to the Tuxedo cake, all portions were adequate (and they did not serve smaller slices of the cake than usual because of the special).  Definitely miss this location -- and will be back again soon!   P.S. Their flatbreads were also on special today -- be sure to try it if you get a chance! They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went for dessert during weekday late night because everything was closed  Decent place, good service,  good selection of dishes on menu  Ended up ordering red wine, waffles and ice cream  Others had sandwich & beer, cake, coffee  Overall a good restaurant and will be back"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my step mom. It was great! I love the atmosphere and reasonable prices.  We got sat right away but it was very busy! The chairs were comfy and there were really cool paintings on the wall. Had some really interesting breakfast options with tons of cool variations of eggs Benedict. The waitress was friendly and came by multiple times to refill the coffee and ask how we were."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the Salad with Salmon and it tasted great. Salmon was juicy and salad was fresh and crispy.  Place is clean and fancy yet not very pricy. Spacey comfy booths. There is a patio if you prefer outdoor seating. Great service. Free WiFi.  Overall I recommend that you try this place out. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"Great dessert and coffee.  Service is impeccable.  We went in late Saturday night and were very happy with everything.   Would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"A group of friends/coworkers (5 of us) and I decided to try another Symposium,  as we are noticing more of these Bar/lounges are opening up everywhere now.   We visited Wed night just after 7pm to have desserts only. The restaurant was busy.. pretty much all tables full. We only found out later that there was a special for mussels on that evening.  Our server seemed grumpy and annoyed.. didn't seem to want to be there. It was the first time for 3/5 people eating at this restaurant and they needed more time to decide on what dessert to order.   Our server seemed to only be recommending drink options and really pushing for us to order specialty coffee beverages.  She asked us at least 4 times when we sat down.. even though we clearly mentioned we came here only for dessert.  I asked what were the cake options today (as I know last time from previous experience they don't have them listed on their menu and they don't have all different types every day). She just said that \"I can go look at the cake display.\" Gee.. thanks for the help.. I got up from my seat to look at them and OF COURSE IM A CAKE EXPERT... (not) , NONE OF THE CAKES WERE LABELED.  So, you can had to GUESS the types of cakes they had available. I stood there with another guest in the restaurant and we both didn't know what each of them were.  Nevertheless, I went back to ordering a fruit festival again, this time in a crape.. which was hardly one (super thin and burnt). It was alright. It tastes much better with the waffle.  My friends had the super 5 layer chocolate cake, a waffle dessert and a brownie. Everyone seemed to enjoy their dessert- thus the rating I gave for only this reason.  The server did come back and ask how everything was which was great and again asked us if we wanted one of the specialty coffees again.. and asked again when they cleared our plates. Then when we said no, she just brought us our bill even though we were still chatting, didn't ask for it, and wasnt planning on leaving yet. We just felt rushed.  In the end, as like the other location,  this one seemed much better. Unfortunately though,  they need less grumpy servers.. ones who will smile and need to find a way to label their cakes or have their servers let their guests know what they are instead of playing the guesing game.  Atmosphere was cafe like.. decor was European, Roman like, dark with only neutral colours."}
{"text":"This was the first time my friends and I have come to Symposium. I did a google search on local restaurants in this area and we thought this place would be something different to try- especially given the selection for desserts for after dinner.  I read some previously reviews and was a little hesitant on having dinner here, but thought to give it a try anyways.  My meal was actually quite good- I ordered the Chicken Slovakia meal with a side of fries in my meal. My chicken was cooked great (a bit salty) but nonetheless good. My fries were really good- but not salted and my greek salad was alright, nothing special.  Despite my meal being good, my friend's and husband meals weren't so great. One ordered the pull pork on pita, the other chicken on pita, chicken parmesan sandwich, and mussels as a starter. The pitas were more like crakers - so this wasn't a true meal on it's own, more like a snack. The chicken parmesan was a dry breaded chicken and taste like from frozen and just heated up and the mussels didn't taste right- like it was thawed and re-froze or just cooked from frozen.  We returned the mussels and the server was kind enough to take it off the bill. Later on, a manager came out to apologize for the mussels not being good.  For dessert, my dessert - fruit festival was really good- and large; 2 people could easily share this. We also ordered a cookie dough cheese cake, a mouse cake, and an apple dessert. These menu options were just OK according to my friends. Nothing spectacular. It was unfortunate that the blender was broken .. On a saturday night where we wanted to order some blended drinks (visited Sat. March 1).  Service seemed slow and the server had seated us to a table of 4 when there were 5 of us eating full meals. We asked to be moved to a larger table, or to even attach the empty table of 2, but she said no she can't do that.   Overall, I would only recommend this place as a cafe and dessert bar lounge. The entree menu was too diverse, which makes it hard to be proficient in making one food category. Therefore, it's understandable why other reviewers didn't enjoy their meals as well."}
{"text":"I just left this establishment, and I'm going to be very honest when I say I'm extremely disappointed. I've been going to Symposium for over five years, and though I've had good experiences in the past, tonight was almost shocking. We arrived at 11 pm, and the place was no where near busy (~5 tables, mainly couples, all of which had already received their orders or were in the process of paying). To begin, it took our waitress 20 minutes to come back for our order after seating us. Actually, she never did come back, another waitress had to take our order and apologize on her behalf. She did not seem the least happy to be working there tonight, nor did the other 3 waitresses (not short staffed when considering the number of clientele). After taking our simple order of two specialty coffees, it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive. It wasn't so much the lengthy process which upset me, but rather, when our coffees arrived, my partner's was half spilled out of the cup (to which I made a comment but the waitress didn't seem to hear) with majority of the whipped cream melted down, and my coffee arrived stale and lukewarm. I asked to have another one made, this time hot, and again I had to wait a lengthy amount of time for my coffee. When it finally arrived, the coffee looked nothing like my previous order, so I asked the waitress to clarify if this was Spanish coffee. She replied with \"I don't know.\" I tasted it, and I can say it definitely was missing the creme de cacao (the drink only requires three ingredients...how do you mess that up?). Though I would normally say kudos to restaurants that send out a manager to fix an issue promptly, within 10 minutes, I saw from across the room a man walking - and maintaining eye contact with me - with body language that just screamed arrogance. He swayed up to our table, placed one hand on it and his other hand on his hip, and didn't even ask what the problem was. I asked him if he was the manager, and he replied with, \"I am one of them,\" and I told him immediately that this is the second order of my coffee and that it was not correct. With barely a care, he said it was correct, and that he watched the waitress make it. I commented that it tasted nothing like Spanish coffee, let alone their own original order, and without offering any solutions other than \"do you want something else?\" he gave me a look of \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" I told him I wanted it removed from the bill and that I would not be drinking it. My partner quickly finished his order so that we could leave and salvage what time we had left in the night, yet it still took another extended period of time to get our bill! When it did arrive, the bill showed a charge for my partner's drink, and TWO Spanish coffees! Were they really going to charge me for the two orders which they had messed up (in actuality was ONE order) if I hadn't asked for it to be removed? We swiftly paid, and hightailed it out of that establishment. Though it's tempting to give this place another chance because of good experiences in the past, the attitude of the manager tonight, whose name I learned was Minh, was just below standard for any level of food service. It probably explains the low morale of the waitresses working tonight, and the small number of clientele on a Friday evening. Very disappointing indeed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunches/dinners and every time has been a good experience. Inisde is spacious and has a nice laid back atmosphere. It's almost a cross between a restaurant, bar and cafe. It's great for casual get togethers with friends or family. They also have a patio which they open up when the weather is nice - always a nice option to have if you enjoy sitting outside.  My go-to dish is the fettucine alfredo. It's rich, flavourful, and surprisingly filling. Would also recommend any of the sangrias."}
{"text":"All around lousy place.  The people who go here clearly do not have a taste for good food.  It's a jumbled mess of bad service, large menus and cold food.  About the only positive is the patio which there are few of around."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday for a late lunch with 3 other people. Service was slow even though there was only 6 people in the restaurant while we were there. The food was nothing to get excited about and was disappointing that they use a garlic oil in their grilled chicken Greek salad. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I attended here as part of an Irish Wake for a friend.    Our meal started off with spinach dip and pita wedges with two sides of sweet potato fries.   The dip was a disappointment.  It seems this dip included shredded carrots.  This made serving up the dip to share in awkward chunks.  Plus I found the parts without carrot to be a bit runny.  I prefer a dip that is firmer especially if you are eating it with nacho chips and or toasted pita wedges.    The sweet potato fries were great.  Crispy and done to perfection.  They also come with a dipping sauce but the thimble sized sauce containers meant you didn't have a lot of dip to share.    My main was the butter chicken rice bowl.   The person beside me ordered the burger.  My rice bowl was a generous portion however, I would have preferred an Indian bread as opposed to more pita wedges.  The chicken was also generous within the bowl.  However, the food lacked flavour.  Really, really bland.  Even with liberal doses of salt and pepper the food tasted, Meh!  The burger looked great and was cooked to order.  I did try the side: onion rings.   The were hot and tasty.  I was going to order a steak but opted for a cheaper meal as the tab was being picked up by the family.  A family member did order the Jack Daniels steak.  But the meal was tough and chewy.  My burger buddy tried the steak and said the sauce was overwhelming.  He suggested it was better as a side and used to marinate the steak.    The place does have an excellent selection of wines and beers.  The Pino Grigio I had was very good.    I guess if you like bland or wish to add salt to taste then you might find this place agreeable.  I left feeling Meh."}
{"text":"Average.  We went here tonight for the first time. I couldn't help but think if we paid a little bit more we could of gone somewhere way nicer.  Service was poor. Had to ask twice for water. I saw a customer complain about her dish, 3 tables over. The server and a girl washing tables were disagreeing with the customer saying \"that's the seasoning!\" Then the server ate something off the customer's plate. That's weird!!  Food was good but nothing great. The fire cracked shrimp flat bread had maybe 3 tiny pieces of shrimp on it. Not enough sauce. It was really a pizza crust toasted with sauce smeared in the middle. Calamari was good. I've had better but it was good. We had the jack daniels steak. It was good. I would of liked more veggies. Mashed potatoes were boring. Not that good. White sangria was good. Tiny amount of fruit and lots of ice. Lots of pineapple juice. Even my boyfriend's mom said it's just a lot of juice.  Cakes were displayed in the back. Back area could be made way nicer. It felt awkward standing by these tables to stare at the cakes. Why not have this at the front? Then customers can see it when they walk in and not hover over other guests as they eat.  The bar area is nice but seems so small.  Would I return? No. Would I recommend? No. My boyfriend's sister and mom were adamant this place has the best desserts. I'm sure the ones at other bakeries are just as good, as these desserts aren't made by the restaurant. They are from a bakery but they won't say which bakery. Strange."}
{"text":"In town on business and from the reviews it sounded like this would be a decent place.  First, the decor is tacky beyond belief.  The menu sounds good, but all the food was dry and looked like it'd been sitting under a headlamp for a while.  The burgers don't come with fries or anything for that matter - everything is extra.  The desserts people on here write about look like they've been sitting in the fridge for a few days well.  And the ambiance?  At 39 I was the youngest person there BY FAR.  This is not a hip place or a place for people that like food by any stretch of the imagination.   Very disappointing and the reviews are extremely misleading."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place for brunch. I had their three eggs, toast, home fries and sausages. The food arrived quickly and I enjoyed my meal.   There were only two points that detracted our meal.  The place cannot mange groups larger than 4 people.  Our group of 9 were seated around four tables of different sizes and heights.  It was not a great set up.  The second point is their patio is great to enjoy the pancakes with strawberries and cream.  But the number of aggressive wasps made eating perilous.    Some patrons could not return to their table because the wasps were so bad.   So if we return it will be in late fall or early spring."}
{"text":"Symposium is a cozy little spot for drinks, food and dessert. It's full service. There is also a patio area.  It's more of a cafe. But I still ordered their Vanilla Milkshake. It was alright, but it had too much whip cream. It was equal parts whip cream and milkshake, and I don't like whip cream.  I also ordered the Symposium burger with a Cesar salad. The burger was alright, pretty standard. The salad had a bit too much dressing.  It's better for drinks, the food is just okay. The service was good at least."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at the north york location. Had the breakfast of champions. Eggs cooked well for over easy. Waffles were light, soft inside but crisp outside. Bacon was average. Service was very good. Waiter came by 3 times to refill coffee on a busy saturday morning. Would give 3.5 stars if possible."}
{"text":"We came for brunch and our food legit came 50 minutes after we ordered! The fresh juice is actually pre made and not really freshly squeezed like they advertise. The tomatoes and lettuce beside our food looked so old and not pleasant. I definitely will not be returning and I don't recommend this place. The manager came and apologized after we spoke up and took care of our bill hence the change to 3stars."}
{"text":"What a turn around today! Bad visit after bad visit....  Good management is always key! Moe! You've made our experience today from previous visits night and day! Although a few from our group did not join us, as we've all had bad experiences in the past, due to the birthday girls wishes, we decided to give it one more shot! A group of friends and I have decided to give this place once last chance, and luckily Moe was managing today, he helped our server and not only was everything well made, arrived promptly the service was good too. All of us enjoyed a lovely brunch on your patio.  Thank you for that."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was lacking. Our bottomless coffee was filled only once when we asked the servers for a refill multiple times and no one showed up. Had to walk up to the counter to get our coffee."}
{"text":"Just came home from lunch on the patio! One of my all-time favourite places for dinner, or lunch. Patio is great. My favourite menu item is probably the muscles Florentine! Just don't look at the calories! Very  very tasty food items. The wings are to die for! Love the bruschetta. Everything tastes so good. The service staff are great. Natasha rocks!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. The staff are great, polite and friendly. Love the daily specials, especially 2 for 1 cakes slices on Sundays.  Was excited to see this location open last year."}
{"text":"Symposium Cafe feels like the embodiment of the \"Canadian Dream\". Imagine taking a stroll (or driving your minivan) from your suburban home on a Sunday morning, and ending up at this restaurant. Oh look, right next to you, the rolling green hills of a golf club. You are greeted with average-tasting North American brunch items, but also the smiles of servers that soaked in the essence of Canadian friendliness.   If there's one word for Symposium, it's cozy. It's situated in a cozy plaza on the edge of a cozy suburb. It's got a big, bright, cozy feeling inside with high ceilings and great decor. Large groups can sit very comfortably. Even the people are cozy. Speaking of the people, they are the reason this Symposium is my go-to place for large brunch groups.   Exhibit 1: I've never been told no when I call in to book a group of 10-20 people for brunch. We've also never been rushed out of the restaurant. Now, I don't know if it's because they never seem that busy, but hey, it works to my advantage!  Exhibit 2: One time, the manager very kindly called me back after I made a reservation and informed me another large group had booked at the same time. It's not that they can't accommodate us, he was worried that we would get our food a little slower because the kitchen has to handle two large table orders at once. So he asked if we'd like to move our reservation by 30 mins, which we did. Good Service 101: this is it.   Exhibit 3: I've never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time for my food. Whether it was 2 people or 16 people, the food came at a reasonably staggered pace.   Exhibit 4: They're all really nice. Like they actually want you to be there. Amazing.  Food? Well, like I said, It's average. My pants are not blown off but I'm not angry at my plate either. Plus, they have the calorie count on the menu for all you macro counters out there. I've never been here for dinner, but the brunch prices are aligned with my expectations for brunch food. Things range from $8-$20 with a beverage option at $1.95 (e.g. tea, coffee, americano, latte, hot chocolate, etc). If you want alcohol, they've got a nice, long list of cocktails and a nice, tall wall of liquor bottles.   No, their eggs are not the smoothest, their waffles are not the fluffiest. Their benedicts are not the most impressive and their lattes are way too sweet and don't taste enough like coffee. BUT, I have and I will come back to Symposium again and again. No, their food is not the best, but where else can I book in a party of 10+ for brunch with such ease and comfort? Nowhere.   (75/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"I just got back from here and I can't even breathe (that's a good thing.. coming from me)  I had the chicken souvlaki on a bun with a side of caesar salad. The salad was on point. Each lettuce leaf was coated with dressing and the croutons were perfect. My sandwich was SO good! I was happy with the bread because it was slightly toasted and not hard that I'm missing a tooth or retainer.  My friend and I decided to get dessert and even that was heavenly. We got the symposium east meets west on a waffle. It had chocolate and vanilla ice cream with bananas and strawberries on the side with a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Are you drooling? Cause that's what it said on the menu...  and we actually drooled.  Then we had lattes on top of that and it was pretty good as well. Not too caffeinated. Although, I have to say, I got a vanilla latte and to be honest I didn't really taste much of the vanilla.  The atmosphere was nice - dim lights, low/high tables, bar area, live music (playing great tunes) and tv's around showcasing the hockey game. The pricing is reasonable. The choices are minimal, which I like. I don't like having 100+ options."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a quick dinner before the movies. It was on a Friday so the special was fish and chips, Two pieces and a side for 11$ I believe.   The service was pretty quick and the server was pleasant but the food was slightly below average. The battered fish were more soggy than crispy and The fries were okay as well.   I most likely won't be back as this cafe isn't really my cup of tea and there are plenty of food options in the area."}
{"text":"Really have to be honest. How in the world anyone can give a place five stars for what I ate.... My wife had something that was warmed in a bag (eggplant) it looked hideous and she ate less that half. My burger and fries were below par of what five guys would sell.  Anyplace that is able to their staff watch food network should be able to grasp this.  Make food from scratch."}
{"text":"Long story short: the food is good but the staff are unprofessional. Long wait times for just about everything.   Details?  I have been here a couple of times with my friends and every single time (whether it be lunch, dinner or dessert), we are made to wait such a long time to be greeted, to be seated, to make our order and to be asked if we need any refills (or be asked at all). One time, two waiters came to our table to get our order. Seems disorganized to me.   This past Sunday my friend and I just wanted a drink and dessert. We stood at the front for at least 10 minutes. There was a party at the back and maybe four tables of couples and one full table on the patio. Definitely not busy enough to not even greet new customers at the door. One kitchen staff was talking to one of the waitresses and putting French fries into his mouth like a walrus/ vampire. Funny if you're in a back room or fooling around with friends on your own time, but not really when you should be working and you're at the front of the restaurant. We ended up seating ourselves at the bar and waited for someone to walk by. We ordered a blueberry tea and glass of wine with an Oreo cake. Everything took so long to arrive to our table. My friend had to slow herself down from drinking all of her beverage so she could save some to have with the cake (and she had a hot beverage so it's not like that's usually a hard thing to do). We finally finished our drinks and cake and waited for someone to come by but no one did. Finally waved someone down and got our bill. Our waitress passed off the bill to another  waitress who passed the will back to the original waitress and asked to make change for a $10 bill. All of this passing was done right in front of us as if we weren't there. Kind of unprofessional, if you ask me. I won't be coming back here, which is too bad because the other Symposium locations are great!"}
{"text":"3.5* really, I just can't justify giving it 4.  Symposium has a really cool atmosphere that is very Georgetown. Me and the friend I went with commented on how it'd be the perfect place for hip moms to get together, get drunk, and gossip. And we're pretty sure we saw at least 2 of these groups...  We just went for drinks and dessert. I had the Oatmeal Cookie Martini that somehow actually tasted like an oatmeal cookie. Highly recommended. Their cake selection is pretty extensive and they have some interesting choices for sure. I had a white chocolate cheesecake that was quite delicious.  My only reason for the lack of a stellar rating is that the pricing is a little steep. The $8 martini wasn't all that bad, but $8 for a piece of cake? Not like the portion size was huge, either. And then I paid an extra $1.50 for ice cream. Just seems kind of odd pricing, especially since this is a regular restaurant with full meals. I could not imagine paying that much for dessert if I'd also bought an entree there.   I do want to go back and try their entrees though as the place smelled great!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for a quick breakfast on a Saturday. Surprisingly it's not very busy in the morning...I guess people are used to sleeping in on the weekends(lucky ducks).   Service wasn't the greatest even tho they were trying their best to accommodate.   Food was mediocre at best. I did enjoy their old school French toast, wasn't thick and was thoroughly toasted Not like the fancier brunches that are thick and soggy on the inside. It came with 4 crispy bacon strips that I enjoyed but as you can see, it was overly deep fried to the point that if you drop it on the plate it would shatter into a million pieces that would be perfect for a caesar salad. It's yummy but not the healthiest. You'll need to chug water after this meal.  I guess they wanted to balance it out with a fruit bowl on the side. Well I left it on the side since the fruit did not look fresh and was probably left over from the night before.  Judy the manager did take her time to welcome and thank every patron and even asked for feed back. I wanted to give her my yelp review on the spot but we were in  a hurry. Sorry!   This would be awesome hangover food nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for brunch. For dinner I had the pesto salmon.  For the price - this place is fantastic. Where else can you get a Salmon entree for $20 with two sides? Everything seems fresh and high quality as well. The veggies are cooked to perfection and fresh, and the salmon is well seared and the sauce was tasty as well. I chose the mashed potatoes and they were excellent. My wife had a pad thai and enjoyed it thoroughly. Portions are large as well. Love this place and it's great to have something like it in the neighborhood which is dominated by bubble tea and Korean."}
{"text":"SIMILAR PRICING TO BIG CHAIN FAMILY RESTAURANTS BUT MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND FOOD Our kids always like to go to big chain family restaurants for the kiddie menus - e.g. Swiss Chalet, Lone Star Cafe, Montana, etc.  For the adults, it usually is a disappointment.  However, at Symposium, at similar pricing, the adult dishes were much better quality, the servers were very attentive and atmosphere casual but nice.  We went on \"date night Thursday\" and for $40, we had two starters, two entrees (old fashioned pot roast, bbq whiskey pot tenderloin medallion were examples), two dessert drinks and one huge slice on cake to share.  The kids ordered from the kids' menu and the size was big and the dessert better quality than big chain - eg. warm brownie with ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce.   We will definitely come back to try the other daily specials or to try their breakfasts."}
{"text":"Thouroughly enjoyed my desert at Symposium last night. The fruit waffles dish was amazing, light and flavourful, a good mix of ingredients."}
{"text":"Hands down worst breakfast I've ever had.   - Dirty restaurant: none of the tables were clean when we came in. They wiped our table off with a dirty cloth, leaving chunks of someone else's cake behind.   - Waited 5+ mins to order drinks. Water came with mysterious things floating in it. Sent it back. Waited 5+ more minutes to order food.   - Strawberry/banana/orange smoothie was pretty much served in a shot glass.   - Ordered Eggs Provençal: over-poached eggs, cold hollandaise and home fries. Absolutely bland.   - Companion had breakfast of champions: Sunny-side up eggs were half-cooked; waffle may as well have come straight out of the fridge. Bacon was the only saving grace.   - Biggest pet peeve: waited 10 minutes to get the bill, then even longer to pay. Thinking at this point, \"Get me out of here!!!\"  One star for okay service."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Friendly wait staff and very clean. My wife and I heard from a friend that the burgers were awesome and she wasn't lying.   We're going to come back for the breakfast sometime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday celebration where she reserved a table on the back patio.  This plaza is located pretty north and out of the way in a residential area.  Regardless, this place had a nice intimate vibe throughout the evening.  I ordered a slice of chocolate caramel cake and a mocha.  Take a look at the pics below - they tasted just as good as they look.  Symposium is a great place to go for dessert after dinner.  It's comparable to the likes of other dessert cafe places like Cafe Mirage.  I'd definitely return, but it's usually out of the way, being on the outskirts of Markham."}
{"text":"The food here is good but nothing to write home about. We tried their pastas, steaks, & rice bowls all are good but not great. Perhaps they need a better chef? However on the other hand, their cocktail drinks are really good, the raspberry mojitos were delicious & also their juice freezies. The ambiance with the Italian wall frescoes and the customer service were extremely excellent! We will continue to come here in the future if we have the opportunity."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant with my family for a few years now. Wouldn't say we are regulars, but we've been here a lot. Every single time I've been here the food and service has been lovely, except for this past Father's Day. Long story short, we waited almost an hour and a half for our food, which was not even that great. It is possible that they were understaffed, and we were also told that there were problems in the kitchen, but if we knew we would be waiting that long for food - that wasn't even up to par mind you! - we would have left. I will not be returning here, which is sad because every other experience I've had has been nice. Sorry Symposium, you really dropped the ball."}
{"text":"Boasting a nice patio and a clean and elegant setup, this restaurant has a varied menu and the food is great. The problem? The service is consistently brutally slow. We've been for breakfast and dinner and both times we waited over an hour for our food to role out of the kitchen. In the meantime, we were left with empty glasses and no one around to ask for a refill. It's disappointing that the service is consistently so slow as it detracts from an otherwise nice restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nice and well maintained.  The food took a while coming to the table even though it wasn't overly busy.  The food was good and the sweet potato fries were delicious.  Can't complain about the quality of the food but the service was horrible.  Waitress constantly forgot what we asked for had to keep waving people down, and we were questioned on what we ordered.  Overall summary, food is good but service makes the overall experience poor."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was decent but service was so slow!! All the servers seem very new, they all kinda stood around and didn't know what they were doing. We asked for water when we first sat down and nobody came by with water or to take our orders.   We finally flagged down the supervisor and he found us our server. They were all pretty friendly but I guess they all still in training. Other than the slow service, it wasn't bad.   We tried their wraps and both tomato soup and cream of broccoli were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"First time I went here my friend ordered an appetizer that tasted horrible. I didn't think I'd visit again but a few weeks ago I ended up here. Ordered the symposium burger. Very impressed. The sweet potato fries were perfect. The garlic sauce it came with was also very tasty. They have deals every day of the week. The decor and ambiance is very nice in this cafe. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Love the calamari here My fav appy  Burger is decent as well along with the wraps  Fav night is still Sunday for the two for one cake slices  However the Harvest Sensation crepe is the cream of the crop for desserts here"}
{"text":"For a brand new location I am quite disappointed in the service  I have been a couple times and getting served takes a year and a day  The worst had to be a late Friday night  Older guy was serving us....not sure if he was the manager or supervisor......barely anybody was in the restaurant.....he paid more attention to this other family that was there......took maybe a good 10 to 15 minutes before he took our drink order.....and that began the night of long periods of waiting between everything  I found the service at the Ajax location 10x better  I was tempted to not give a tip but I gave a smaller than normal one  I hope they improve in this area cuz I do like the food there"}
{"text":"I found a piece of wood in my salad. I was so disgusted. They accommodated me by offering me half off of my bill but that is gross."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast one morning, decided to try something new. The service was good and it was decently busy. Decor is dark and modern, not very cozy for breakfast - definitely better for dinner. Prices are a little higher than other breakfast/brunch places in the area and the portions are smaller as well. I had the eggs benny with potato hash. The one nice thing is that they deep fry the hash so it's more crispy like fries. I can't say the food the bad, but it wasn't anything special. Would probably come here again if all the other places nearby were super busy."}
{"text":"We had a large group of seven. Service was good. Everyone enjoyed their meals. A good varied menu.  Dessert was a big hit."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years but never went  for brunch.  7 of us went and ordered everything different. Food was great. Service was excellent. They help each other out serving.  Latte was $1.95 if you buy a breakfast dish.  Good coffee. 11am to 2 or 3pm (Sorry, can't remember what time it ends) there is a $5 mimosa special that was also very good.  Will definitely go back for brunch"}
{"text":"I work a couple doors down and finally decided to check it out after years on my lunch. Ordered breakfast separately because I simply can't eat 3 eggs at the moment. I asked for well done bacon and I got turkey bacon (don't mind it but I don't need to pay extra for something more premium I didn't order). It was just 3 simple menu items. Bacon, potatos, and 1 egg. Waited for my bacon to be cooked while my potatoes and egg get cold... along with watching servers eat at that turkey bacon while my correct order is being made. Don't get it wrong though, Waitors/waitresses were kind. Not the best first impression for just ordering 3 items. The food doesn't suck, just my 1st hand experience did.   On another note, after I paid my bill and was offered the bacon free of charge for the mess up.  Changed from 2 stars to 3. Hopefully better luck next time!"}
{"text":"If daily deals are a thing, you should definitely try out Symposium Cafe. As a student from Waterloo, Symposium used to be my ultimate chill spot - wine and cheesecake, what more can you ask for right? But a new location opened near my home back in Markham!   I came here on a Monday night, and it was the burgers and pint special, each at $3.75. It's a good deal, but you should definitely check out what interests you before going. They have specials for date night for $40, martini specials, pasta night specials, etc.   I also ordered the Mussels appetizer (~$10), and it was huge, I would say about 2lbs of mussels cooked with tomato sauce. This is more of a family restaurant with a more conservative (not unique) menu. It's nothing special, but if you find the right day of the week to go, you will definitely be paying a good price for a good quality meal, with comfortable seating and wide variety of cakes to choose from for dessert (who doesn't love sweets to end off the day?)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice.  Once for the date night special and the second time on Burger Mondays. The owners have done a great job converting the previous Max store to the place it is now. The date night special has a good selection and you can add half a bottle of house wine for $10.  On burger night, they have the regular burger and selected beer for $4 each. The burger does not come with sides and only lettuce and tomatoes.  You are able to add extra toppings like mushroom, cheese and bacon.  You can't beat the price.    There are other specials during the week. If you want a simple and causal but a place with nice decor, Symposium Cafe is where you go."}
{"text":"Last Friday, 12 of us made a stop at Symposium for dinner before heading off to the Classic Bowl which is 2 steps away for their cosmic bowl (Try not to judge the bowling -sometimes it's good to relive high school days!)  The place is known for its cheesecake so some of us skipped dinner altogether and went straight for dessert lol. I had a chicken quesadilla, which was served hot and tasted good but nothing extraordinary. The others had vegetarian pad thai but it came with a topping of eggs, so if that's an issue for someone make sure to mention that to your server.    Amongst our dessert orders (Can't remember everything that was ordered now, too much food to keep track of!), were two orders of marble cheesecake, chocolate divine crepes and  chocolate chunk banana split. The banana split looked tempting but the friend who ordered it told us it was 'horrible' while he kept spooning mouthfuls without a pause. This actually is his way of protecting his dessert from anyone with a ready spoon. He didn't even share a bit with his wife lol (I'm sure she had something to say to that in the car ride back home lol). All in all, I think it's safe to say the banana split was good because it was finished in 5 minutes flat!   The marble cheesecake was a hit with all of us who tried it. The helping is generous so I found myself unable to finish it all (since I'd had dinner too). I guess the ones who just had dessert turned out to be the smarter cookies after all!  They don't have the marble cheesecake on their menu but they usually have it in the restaurant so check with the server.   There's plenty of seating available and the servers are friendly. Nothing worth driving all the way for but it's worth considering if you're in the area and it's laidback enough for a noisy group of friends to chill. I'll be back to try more of their cheesecake varieties."}
{"text":"We've been here several times now and haven't been disappointed with the food or service once!  We've had the calamari, pork tenderloin, chicken wrap, and a waffle dessert.  We've recommended to several of our friends and co-workers and it's our favourite place to go when we can get out on either a date night or out with friends."}
{"text":"I like to atmosphere at Symposium it came to georgetown with much excitement. I have been a few times and generally find the service slow and the food to be just okay.  The pricing is fairly high.  Often to make up for poor service they offer free desert, but that does not really make up for the time a patron has lost."}
{"text":"Overpriced and tacky.  The food here is not the best.. it's mediocre AT BEST, and that's saying a lot. I'm always dragged here by coworkers but it's always a disappointment for me. Foodwise, anyway. Everything is something I can make at home, except maybe done a bit better and presented better. The chicken tenders were $9 and they just look like sad, dry shriveled up old mcnuggets with two skinny celery and carrot pieces.. 2/10 Crab and cheese pasta dish was ok.. very heavy sauces.. I can feel the fat clogging up my veins as I eat it. 5/10 The chicken caesar wrap is below average.. contents inside are usually cold or room temperature.. not something I'd want in a nice warm meal. Comes with a few sad looking fries.. I think there was under 10 on my plate. It looks like somebody already went in on my meal before I did. 4/10 Calamari would not be recommended by me. When I bite into it, I taste no squid. Just a shit-ton of frying batter. Gross. 3/10 The dessert here is ok actually! The portions are huge.. definitely sharing portions. (Or on-your-own portions if you're hungry for some ice cream) Presented nicely and contains a lot of everything they offer. 8/10 Drinks.. meh, it's a hit or miss. In the summer, I had amazing exotic drinks that sent me to the couch. Now, their drinks are mediocre - there are pitcher deals but a lot of their drinks do not taste accurate to the name.. the mojito tastes like sweetened toothpaste and their margaritas taste like mouthwash and perfume. 5/10 My friends and I got a pitcher to share but we ended up making only one of us finish it because it was too gross.  Service really varies. Many times they're great and friendly. However, once I was trying to order a piece of cake as I left and the server just would not help me for some reason. I kept trying and trying and she kept giving me looks and telling me to 'hold on'. After forever and a day, she acknowledged what I wanted but still wouldn't give it to me. I gave up and decided to go as she called out to me and told me \"wait, if you still want it, it won't take that long\" ... um no.  I don't recommend coming here, there's so many more places you can go and save more money for a better meal."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on the weekend as part of my exploration of the neighborhood I live in. While a part of me found it tacky, another part of me (and my husband) kind of enjoyed the decor on the walls (old looking Italian mural paintings - think Venus in a clamshell). I think the big open windows made it look more inviting as well.  The place didn't look too crowded at the time we arrived however I found it took a little while for the staff to notice us and seat us. It then took a bit longer for our server to finally attend to us. I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt and say she was kind of new or having an off day...  Brunch was typical but trustworthy. I got the Eggs Benedict and wasn't disappointed. I got exactly what I ordered. Only downside is that the whole place is probably more expensive than the Eggsmart that is much closer to where I live. I am interested in trying their dinner menu and while I couldn't do it at the time, because I was already full from brunch, their daily deals seemed promising - Sundays offering 2 for 1 cake slices and the cakes looked delicious. I would love to come back and try them."}
{"text":"I think the flaws begin with the menu. Symposium attempts to do more than they can. They should stick to doing desserts and coffee because their food is not up to par. For one, their food is tasteless. I had their chicken souvlaki and $20 and a small portion of food later I was left very disappointment. My friend had their burger and was also quite disappointed. The burger was tasteless and greasy.   The service is on par with their quality of food. Servers are impatient, slow and at times rude.   Their dessert is also very sweet and their bananas aren't ripe enough from what I have seen from them, but if that's your thing then by all means give it a try.   If you want dessert or coffee, give this place a try (even that I would avoid) but if you're going for food, DEFINITELY avoid it. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor overall is stunning at this location. The food on the other hand is just sub par and service is mediocre, as they never refill our waters. It's a chill last minute plans type of place."}
{"text":"During my visit to Canada, I went to visit my family. Later, my sister and I decided to go tobagonning, a form of sledding. On our way we decided to stop here for a quick bite, but unfortunately with the excessive wait time and mediocre food this put a halt in our hopes to go tobagonning. I do understand that there was a large party ahead of us and may have contributed to the wait, but my sister and I still missed our chance for tobagonning. This is why I am forced to give this restaurant a 3 stars."}
{"text":"This location is perfect as it's in the buzzing North York area between Yonge/Finch and Yonge/Shepard. They have the perfect breakfast; hash browns, eggs, waffle, toast, etc. Lovely atmosphere. Waiters are slow to greet and attend to you. I've tried a few of the foods outside of breakfast and it was bad. The Butter chicken is served with large grain rice, not basmati or plain white rice. The rice is almost take like parboiled rice and the butter chicken is not flavourful at all. Food is undesirable. Perfect breakfast spot though."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place and enjoyed their foods, as well as desserts. However, I've found that it has gone downhill in terms of both food and service lately across different locations. I had the Eggs Benjamin and it was quite good and filling. My friend had the Brie, Mushroom, Spinach omelette and she liked it as well, IF THE RYE BREAD DIDN'T HAVE MOLD ON IT. That's a health hazard and they didn't really do much about it. When we addressed the issue to her, she simply said she will show it to her manager. After speaking to her manager, she asked if my friend wanted another piece from a new loaf. The manager should have come out to apologize at the least. So disgusting.  NB: while writing this review, the table behind us sent their food back too because they found mold on their bread as well. If you come here, maybe don't get anything with bread.  After I wrote this and got the bill, the server actually told us they comped the item with the moldy bread so at least something was done about it. I'm just surprised the manager did not personally address the issue with us, since he wasn't busy and was just watching TV."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow, the servers did not know the menu or ingredients in the dishes, nor did they know basic server skills, I got something different then what I ordered, we went with 4 people and no one was satisfied, will not be returning"}
{"text":"They need to work on bringing all the food out at one time.  Almost every time there I'm brought my main entree several minutes before my wife.  10 to 15 minutes. Once over 20 minutes.  I was finished before she got her food.  Also, when you asked for something extra after the food is delivered it takes too long for them to deliver it. Ie. I asked for a different sauce for my chicken tenders and it took over 15 minutes to go get it.  The restaurant wasn't busy.  So, if you are in a hurray this is not the place.  You patience will be tested."}
{"text":"We came to Symposium for late breakfast on a Sunday after reading nice reviews on yelp. The address was not exact, so we were searching a little. Restaurant will surprise you with decore, which is in old italian style. We wanted to sit on the terrace, but came too late and it was full. Inside was really chilly in my opinion.  Our waitress was very charming during the service, although we waited for a really long time for the bill, even after everyone was done eating.  I had a fladbread with grilled vegetables and I also tried the flatbread with chicken, pesto and artichokes. Both of them I would highly recommend.  We also shared a fresh mango juice which was absolutely delicious. Everyone else had a breakfast meal and everyone liked it. Although its not one of the cheap options in the area, we all enjoyed our meal and we will come again."}
{"text":"Best eatery in bolton hands down.  Everything on menu is great and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We ordered the fusilli pasta and steak Wrap with the broccoli and cheddar soup. We had a trainee serve us which was shadowed by an older experienced staff. It was a pretty awkward experience for us as the older staff had to tell him the \"right\" ways every time he finished talking to us. Tbh I think he did fine on his own, and you could sense the pressure he was feeling. The pasta was very simple - could have definitely had more vegetables instead of just a few olives. The pasta portion was also pretty small for $15. The steak wrap was ok; they overloaded it with the sweet bbq sauce. The broccoli cheddar soup was just ok too - pretty thick than usual. They do however seem to have great specials and I do remember eating their burgers, which are not bad. Will probably come back just for their burgers, drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"We arrived at 10pm on Sunday. Very cozy atmosphere, friendly and personable staff (but not pushy or pretentious).  Food is super tasty - even their side vegetables (savoury buttery flavour).   Their appetizers were 33% off at that time. We had sweet potato fries and sweet chilli Thai chicken bites (delicious).   We also received 2 for one for a slices (huge) of cake (banana coconut pineapple). It was moist, not too sweet - but still a guilty treat.   I will definitely be going back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say...crazy me who worked 17 years with the public and catered to them.  I get seated and it's freezing so I asked if they could turn off the fan which was over me and 10 minutes later someone comes by to say that \"they\" are all hot so maybe we should just move you.  Who are \"they\"....oh they are the waitresses....interesting how clients don't come first.  Then we seemed to wait forever for our drinks and again after  eating  we waited way too long for a take out dessert which was the wrong one....wasn't even busy???? Our waitress was very polite however and the meal was fine.......I just don't get how the service industry puts themselves first."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed with this restaurant. Food was overpriced for what you got and wasn't even that good. They ran out of 2 dishes that we wanted so we had to settle for other choices. Waiter didn't seem to care enough to fill our drinks when they emptied and it took 15 minutes and then we asked for them to take our plates away. All the meals came out at different times and their signature burger was quite salty(should've went and got a Mcdouble). Waiter didn't ask my wife how she wanted her steak done so she got it cooked wrong. Although all the negatives the ambiance was nice and chairs were comfy. Dessert was pretty good but maybe it was because of the sub-par entrees. Overall, it was overpriced and had bad service but the building itself was nice. Wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Gotta love a good Eggs Benny in nice surroundings, with good service at a good price. Isn't this what the game is all about?  I knew lunch would be around 3 PM, so I needed a Brekky to hold me over.   Symposium was on the way, and looked better than your typical Daybreak. Better interior, better coffee, and just a better overall experience.   I asked my attentive server if the Hollandaise was fresh made or synthetic. I was assured it was fresh, so I was in. My Benny arrived with crisp potatoes and 3 eggs on thick back bacon and English muffins. Normally I see lesser joints charging more for only 2 eggs--this is a deal!  In comparison, I will never again eat Eggs Benedict at Cora's or Bagel World or Daybreak or Sunset Grill. They are all great places, but real Hollandaise for less cash is a win anyway you serve it!"}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast, Symposium is at the high end of the spectrum. Sure, you can order a typical egg dish, or omelettes, but there are a few differences. Take the Eggs Benedict for example-many restaurants have Benny on the menu, but often with fake Hollandaise. I had the 3 egg Benny, poached exactly right. I was offered a couple of unique additions, like mushrooms, which I really should have tried out.   Other key features in the menu include a Caramel Banana French Toast that is a real winner. If you just want it plain, the Early Bird Specials work, but that would not be in keeping with the lush, elegant interior.   And, unusual for breakfast, you can order fresh made cappuccino and espresso of you really need a morning jolt. Great way to kick off the day!"}
{"text":"I've embarrassed myself.  I stopped in for breakfast looking for Eggs Benedict, my common measure of a good breakfast restaurant.  Symposium does not look like a typical breakfast joint, with its cushy padded deuces and quads, warm, rich decor and an enticing desert counter.  I asked the friendly waitress if the Hollandaise for the eggs benny is fresh or synthetic.  She advised me that it depended on the day.  I suspect not all the cooks can pull off a stable Hollandaise.  I settled on the Banana Caramel French Toast.    A few minutes later, six perfectly done slices of French Toast robed in a succulent caramel sauce with a generous punctuation of hot banana slices arrived at my table.  The side of crisp bacon was exactly correct.  I am a sucker for a good caramel sauce--not too sweet, with a rich buttery flavour and the right consistency.  This was a handmade caramel, perfectly ambered without charring, and almost exactly the right amount (I always want just a bit more).  How could this be any better?  Maybe a dollop of fresh, stiff whipped cream on top. If this cook can pull off a caramel this good, why not Hollandaise?  If this was a canned caramel--no, that is not possible.  If I ran the place, the only thing I would address is the worn seating, and the gash in the leather couch at the entrance. It sends the wrong message about such a good restaurant.  This is a great place.  I intend to try it for lunch or dinner next time I'm in the area. By the way, if you don't want to be embarrassed like me, DO NOT lick the plate clean unless you are the lone diner..."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly server with food coming out in good time.  Most of us in our party had the Monday special (burger and beer).  Not bad for the value and surprisingly the burger was filling and fairly tasty.  I wish the place was a little larger such as the size of a Canyon Creek or Milestones.  It just seemed a bit crowded in the restaurant.  A few of our party members are regulars and have been to this location during a number of times in the past.  This was my first experience and I would say that I might give it a try again sometime in the near future...Probably try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"Food is good, not for the price though. It is quite pricey. Service is mediocre, we were waiting at our table to get our orders taken for 10 minutes. Once we got our food we were looking for the waitress to ask for a refill and when she finally were able to flag her down we were finished with our meals."}
{"text":"Cozy and casual place to have one of their daily special drinks, but that's about it.  We tried their $5 burger and I'd rather have a big mac (disclosure , I like big macs) the soup was big, which was all it had going for it .   The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is nice but the food is passable."}
{"text":"The cake does justice to its name... chocolate oreo cake was totally worth the drive... the staff and ambience is also perfect!!"}
{"text":"Very happy to see Symposium open in our hood as there isn't a lot of places that serve brunch, nor places with patios and with a robust, varied menu. It's a nice alternative to Buffalo Wild Wings, which is great but kind of one-note.  Pros:  - Beautiful patio, nice interior to restaurant  - Food is great so far.   We've been for brunch twice and dinner once. For brunch we really enjoyed the veggie omelette, the steak & eggs, and REALLY enjoyed the Cuban Breakfast sandwich, wow that was killer.   For dinner we just had some appetizers which were HUGE and not really appetizer size - the steak tips (amazing), the pesto chicken flatbread (so good) and the fish tacos (disappointing honestly - the fish was bland and the strawberry slaw on top of it was portioned incorrectly and didn't really go flavor wise)  - Very kid friendly restaurant, staff is very friendly and accommodating  - Great bar, great selection of beer and drinks (as well as juices and coffees)   Cons:  - Space is a little cramped at times, the booths especially are a little constricted, I understand they don't much have space to work with and I'd much rather them pick that location than somewhere else, but it's not as comfortable as it could be especially when you bring your kids  - Service is a bit slow. Not a huge deal, just don't go if you're in a rush, they sometimes take a bit to get food out or to refill your drink, but when the food does come it's worth the wait  - Price - this is the one problem with the place, it's very expensive which makes it harder to justify visiting, we would go more often if it was a bit cheaper. You get a lot of bang for your buck, portions are big and you'll walk out satisfied but honestly I'd take smaller portions with smaller pricetags any day.  Overall, great addition to the neighbourhood, I hope this one stays the course and doesn't fall into the bad service/poor quality food rut that other Symposium's in the area have suffered from."}
{"text":"Pros: Food and service were decent.  Cons: On a not-so-busy Sunday afternoon, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, although many empty tables were available. A lot of the tables weren't cleared off. Maybe they were understaffed.  Overall, we had a good time - not amazing, but not bad either."}
{"text":"There seems to be a few Symposium Cafe locations popping up all over the GTA.  Both Iriana and I came here to meet up with some of my old friends for a nice dinner night.   Firstly this location has a beauitiful patio and its in a busy location along Yonge just south of 407.   The ambience of this place is nicely layed out with a rustic European/ Mediterranean look with murals, decor, and statues. Our server was extremely polite and attentative to our order.  Noise level is moderate, and most of all its clean!    For food I had their Banquet burger which gave you a choice of cheese, and it was BRIE! What I  admired most about my dish   aside from overall portion and size was my brie, any thicker and it'd be a cheese-steak...that actually put a (fat kid at a buffet) SMILE on my face haha.The overall dish was enjoyable and the fries were not salted, nor oily.  I'll be back for another Symposium episode!"}
{"text":"For some odd reason this place reminds me of café mirage in Scarborough.  A relatively new location away from the craziness of markham I'm glad to see they've opened up a café in this part of town (though it's not my neck of the woods per say). The ambience is chilled out, not too dim, and this location seems to be getting quite popular no matter what part of the day or night.  The layout seems spacious however if your table is seated right at the bar it can be quite a jam, which is what I experienced.   Since we were here for coffee and dessert, Symposium has a few good choices for dessert, but what caught my eye was their Chocolate fudge brownie cheesecake.  Though the presentation was there! The top portion of my cheesecake (the brownie) kept falling off! but nonetheless the decedance of this dessert was great! To help digest this rich cake I ordered a green tea on the side. THough the place is hussling, the service we had was mediocre.  Once our dishes and drinks were served, our waiter seeemed to have forgotten us, and I was, for the most part thirsty for a glass of water.  Overall the place is great just to catch up with friends in a relaxed environment.  So far my first impression of this place is neither here nor there, but I still prefer their Thornhill location."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I enjoy it very much, the service is friendly an the atmosphere is great. I loved the desert selection and the menu is huge! I had the chicken parmesan sandwich both times, and the portions were good for the price. We will deffinetly be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was really good. Went there for breakfast today, it was nearly empty because of the timing, but the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere of the place was really calm and perfect for breakfast. Not to mention the food, which was amazing, had the Cuban sandwich, which was a ton of delicious pork on a soft ciabatta roll. The bread was so fresh and soft, it was really incredible."}
{"text":"+Extensive brunch menu.  -The omelette I ordered (goda & asparagus) was a bit bland.  +The staff was quite attentive during our early morning Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This place is where I go for a decent breakfast. Everything tastes great and the service is excellent and pretty fast everytime. The only thing they could improve on really is portions and to be a little more careful of their cutlery in terms of cleaning. Im pretty picky when it comes to cutlery tho, I cant stand even seeing water stains on my fork."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place. I've given it several shots. Each time has been really disappointing. Food is bland or cooked strangely. Some things taste like they were frozen and thawed, or came from a can.   *****FIVE STARS FOR THEIR CARROT CAKE THOUGH. SERIOUSLY. The only reason I would go. Sky high slice of carrot cake that is perfect to share with a friend over coffee!"}
{"text":"New symposium... woohoo!! and its sooo closeby another plus...   Came here and a Friday night after painting and boy it was busy but thankfully we were seated promptly and to attention detail, we were not seated close to the entrance... that's awesome!   LLBO in effect here. Love the ambiance and decors...daily specials were interesting...late dinner for me cuz didn't eat ahead of time. Ordered the Parmesan chicken sandwich... it was a little dry to be honest but acceptable....it was a *symposium preference * so I guess I had slightly higher expectations when I see that...   Vanilla chai was good...me and a friend were chatting away. Didn't notice the time but our server was great...  Filled our hot waters and taken away empty glasses and plates promptly after I was done.   Came to checkup on us from time to time. Great service. Food pricing was good... this is not a cheap chinese place...ok peeps!   I shall return and try their daily specials..."}
{"text":"We stopped by Symposium in Oakville one night for a late night dessert because I saw some positive reviews on Yelp. We ordered \"East Meets West\" on a crepe, which the menu states is a crepe with strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and strawberry purée, and on the other side, chocolate ice cream, bananas and chocolate sauce, all topped with whipped cream.   Since we had our dog with us, we ordered to-go, and what we received is nothing like the above description. It was a styrofoam container containing a bland, cold, dry crepe (it was awful!), a container with vanilla ice cream, and one with the bananas and strawberries. No chocolate ice cream, no strawberry purée, no chocolate sauce, and no whipped cream. We were going to just sit outside with the dog and eat, but it was impossible as everything had to be put together. Since the crepe was so cold and dry, it just broke apart. Can't believe it was over 10 dollars for that! I won't be back.   Note: I understand that sometimes when you order to-go from a restaurant, some things may be changed so your food doesn't get soggy, but if the dessert was this different from the menu, then I feel I should have been warned on the phone when I ordered. That way we wouldn't have brought the dog and we could've sat inside and tasted the dessert as it was intended to be. No excuse for the crepe though!"}
{"text":"The food was alright, but nothing special. It gave me the feeling of something that would have been acceptable in a small town with $6.99 being the highest price point.  Surprisingly, the food was the best part of my experience.   A few things happened that made me questions the professionalism of the staff:  1) The mug my coffee was served in looked like it have been rubbed against the hood fan in the kitchen before being served. It was covered in grease. It doesn't take more than a decent human being to not serve coffee like this.  2) The server had filthy, long fake nails, and a bar stamp (presumably from the night prior) still on her hand -- is hand washing not required here?   3) the timing of everything was horrendous. And the servers remarks were \"sorry the kitchen was slammed with a bunch of orders\" ... just speechless on this one. Way to throw the restaurant under the bus, so not only was her service terrible but I now know the restaurant doesn't know how to handle Sunday brunch.  I was really hoping for this restaurant to save the dying breakfast joints... looks like breakfast is still better at home."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch - they have all day breakfast until 4pm on Sunday. I got the eggs Benedict and it was decent. However, there is nothing too amazing about the food. Portion was generous and service was good.   I would come here if I am just grabbing a casual brunch."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  Symposium Cafe and Lounge has an identity crisis that actually works to its advantage in the suburbs. Is it a bar, cafe or a nice restaurant? It situates itself in convenient strip malls and fulfills all these roles, boasting a vaguely Mediterranean vibe (like, fake vines and fountains and bananas) that contrives a \"nice outing\" ambience . This makes it the the perfect around-the-corner spot in areas that don't really have around-the-corner cafes, bars, or restaurants.   The most recent incarnation of this growing franchise is in the plaza close to my family home.   Service is slightly stiff given the casual air of the patrons, but other than that pretty good. Food is generally alright. Skip the benny at breakfast, french toast is great. Daily deals seem to be pleasers. Tonight I had the burger/pint deal. Burger was greasy and came with only a single ring of red onion (my dad and I thought that was a hilarious place to cut costs); pint selection consisted of a wide selection of PBR or Sleeman. But hey, it was $3.75 at the place around the corner, and that makes it kind of awesome.    What brings this place from 'ehnn' to 'score!' is simply the fact that it's THERE-- it EXISTS! A place to go in Northern Glen Abbey! There's a patio in the summer! It's decorated for Christmas! A neighbourhood joint to grab a bite/ a pint/ brunch!  So while Symposium isnt all that great, I'm still grateful this franchise took root where the old Rogers Video used to be (lol), and brought its strange brand of manufactured-mediterranean ambience to our corner of the plaza."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  This place is a pretty good place to catch up with friends or have a first date.  It's quaint inside, the menu is decent and I believe in the summer they have a patio.  Before 3pm I believe they have drink specials.    While my friend went for a meal - the salmon with veggies which he said was pretty good - I just wanted some dessert so I tried the caramel brownie.  A little dense for my liking but the caramel crunch gave it a nice flavour.  The prices are decent and all the staff were nice.  I can't remember if they ave brunch but it would be a nice spot to check out.  I will come back once the patio is opened to enjoy my 2 favourite summertime activities - chilling and people watching!  The only negative is that you need to find street parking, or park at one of the lots close by.  But it is easy to access via subway"}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected.  The food was ok, but the service was really slow and they messed up my colleagues order by serving it to someone else first!  So 4 of us were served while 1 was left waiting!  Definitely a faux pas in my books!  The food was ok, the atmosphere is nice, but I can tell why there's not too many of these around."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday afternoon at around 3ish. My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict and I, the eggs Benjamin.   When we got the food the poached eggs were overcooked, the yolk hard. We alerted our waitress (who was absolutely the best) and she alerted the chefs to prepare us new eggs. We got to keep the eggs we had, and my boyfriend savagely ate both his and my overcooked eggs.   The replacement eggs were perfectly cooked, and they gave us a side of hollindaise sauce to replace the sauce poured over the overcooked eggs.   Other than that minor mishap, everything else was great.  The service was the best service I ever encountered. The waitress made lovely small talk with us, and frequently checked up on us to see if everything was alright.   She also helped us select a dessert for us to share after the meal- we ended up going for the fudge cheesecake.  In terms of food the taste was alright. Nothing special about the breakfast nor the dessert, although I did really enjoy the home fries. Menu is a bit on the pricey side as well."}
{"text":"Was at the restaurant with friends for the first time. It has a nice and warm ambiance to it and the wait staff are very attentive. We came at about 5:30pm due to other later commitments and liked the fact that there were early bird specials  I ordered the chicken Souvlaki which came with a small salad in its own bowl and all food arrived very quickly, perhaps too quickly. The salad tasted liked the dressing had been on the salad for quite some time as the lettuce and other vegetables were wilted. This alone was not a show stopper.   I noticed that the chicken in the Souvlaki had a slightly rubbery texture. It didn't seem to be grilled as normal and certainly didn't taste like fresh chicken. The texture, taste and the speed of delivery suggests to me that the meal came from a freezer, onto a microwave oven, then onto the plate.   There are likely cost advantages for restaurants buying frozen entree items but unfortunately when I have them, the chances of me returning to the restaurant is zero. The business has invested heavily in outfitting the store. Why in the world the business would bankruptcy in investing in poor food cooking methods is beyond me. The last place that served microwaved food that I visited was out of business within one year. Not a formula for success."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good breakfast. Took a slice of raspberry shortcake and blueberry pie to go and both were decent. I wouldn't say it was 'over the top' but it wasn't bad for the price."}
{"text":"I was sure to ban Symposium from my list of restaurants after I had the absolute worst service at the Markham location... but I desperately needed breakfast. I was even looking forward to their Sunday deal: 2 for 1 cake slices! Their breakfast was typical but very good. I have to point out that their breakfast sausage links are twice the size you would normally see. They would deserve 4 stars if i wasn't too full for cake after!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend two nights ago for dessert and tea.  Place looks extremely fancy with a patio out front and a well-decorated interior.  We ended up sitting at the bar where lighting was pretty much non-existent and that led to a lot of eye strain for me (yay, myopia!).  Their washrooms are adequately lit and really nice, though!   Our server was really nice; he gave us a few suggestions on desserts and drinks and even three in a free sampler for us because they ran out of whipped cream.    Will probably come back next time, but during the day so that I can appreciate the interior.    P.S. tea lovers, the green tea tropical is really good!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place.  The hostess greeting us at the door was fast and friendly. As for the food it seemed to be expensive for the quantity and quality. I ordered the Jack Daniels filet which came chopped into pieces like it was stewing beef and did not have the texture of a filet. My wife had the soup was ok. Ordered onion rings not a good deal 7 Frozen greasy onion rings for $5.50 come on it's not that hard to make fresh onion rings.  This was our second try there after the first was not good.  Note to the owners. I'm sure my steak was some sort of beef. But I  am an adult and able to cut my own steak, it is very hard to get a medium steak when it is cut up into stewing beef."}
{"text":"French onion soup cold, no onions, cold, cheese hardly melted. 1/10. Fish n chips decent, sweet potato fries overfried. Chicken wrap no real flavor. Ambience ok, but food not up to par."}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast. I went here a couple of times and would go back. The atmosphere is very nice and it is not that pricey. The food is not special but it is very good. I would probably not do the bacon but the ham was very good. My kids really enjoyed it as well and that is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"We ordered an omelet and champion breakfast. The service was fast and attentive. Our servers were very friendly to us and our 3 years old son. We will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"It is an ok restaurant.   Service was very friendly and attentive, but I would say too attentive.  Our waitress came to our table to check if everything's ok almost every 10 minutes during the first 30 minutes.  The food we ordered were so so.  My bf ordered a burger but he could tell right away it was frozen burger meat.  I ordered a fish & chips.  The fish was ok but the fries did really disappoint me.  They were fresh cut but not crispy at all.  We tried the mocha coffee cake.  It was not too sweet but definitely not a \"wow\" one.     We went there on a Friday night.  The atmosphere was good but a bit loud.  The restaurant offers special everyday.  I might just come back for their special...hehe!"}
{"text":"It's a toss-up between this place and Captain John's (RIP) for who might be the worst food establishment in the GTA. Just the very thought of either makes me cringe and  break out a cold sweat. Their infamous calamari brings unpleasant flashbacks of fingernail chewing as a young lad. You would have to use a razor blade to be able to dissect their speciality wings just so you can chew on it some more; OR you can watch it playfully bounced around your plate as you try to cut it with your steak knife. For those who rave about their cakes and I agree they are good, please note that you can get these cakes at your local supermarket for a better deal (La Rocca). I felt a sense of betrayal(by food) after my visit. This place is hustle and bustle and the night-time atmosphere makes you feel like you're dining outside with the bright LED parking lot lights casting an eerie glow. Terrible service, unfathomably bad food and great prices makes for an interesting experience of a lifetime. Be forewarned, visit at your own risk. 1 star because Yelp won't allow me to take away any stars."}
{"text":"pretty good service, the food is not bad either, the ambiance is really nice and the ample parking is so convenient! amazing cake selection ; similar to the one in woodbridge so I'm glad they opened one up north!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, went out 2 days before Christmas on a Friday morning for breakfast with some friends, but got rudely rushed and kicked out by not even the waitress but the manager due to the fact that there was a party and decided it was more important to deal with them than having to deal with more tables, personally I didn't need much service anyway, but the fact that we were rushed and kicked out shows the utmost disrespsect that the manager has for her customers."}
{"text":"So far so good! Yesterday a friend wanted to meet for coffee after 9pm so I looked up some cafes around North York Centre that opened until 12am. The only one that seemed promising was the Symposium and the list of dessert and coffee sounded good. So we came to check it out. I was not disappointed with my pick. So far, one reviewer has used a word that I also mentioned to describe the interior of this restaurant 'rustic'. The look and ambiance inside feels very much like Greek or Italian villa. The decor such as the murals and different floral items arranged on the walls strongly added to the feeling of being a villa-like setting. And almost everywhere that I looked there was something that caught my eye.   My friend just had a tea. I was in the mood for a sweet treat with my coffee so I ordered the East Meets West ice-cream and sliced fruit combination on a waffle. I was thrilled by what was brought to the table. That taste of the dessert ensemble was satisfying.  Our server was friendly and attentive and kept himself busy around the restaurant. There was nothing disappointing about being here for the first time. I hope to return here and try out their savory dishes."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast foods here :) Very spacious and they have comfortable seating. I'd recommend:  CAPPUCCINO & CAFE LATTE Creamy and smooth - No need to add extra sugar, it's sweet on its own already.  EGGS BENEDICT My fav! Their hollandaise sauce and the pouched eggs are nicely done.  ANY CAKE They're so good - I can't remember which one I ordered unfortunately - most likely the Strawberry Cheesecake.. They give you a huge portion.. one piece is good for two people! ;)"}
{"text":"Overpriced brunch and service was shoddy.  We had to ask for everything when the wait staff should of brought it to us in the first place.  Giving points for the nice atmosphere and how the food tasted.  I personally can make the food in the comfort of my own home for a fraction of the price I paid there."}
{"text":"Went in for a super late brunch (3:30) so it was quite empty here cept maybe 4 other tables seated. It's a huge place with really neat decor and music to match.  I can't comment on the lunch or dinner food since we stuck to breakfast but isn't it nice to find a place that's offering breakfast at almost 4pm? :)  Food was decent. We had French onion soup which had a nice broth but they don't use Gouda and the bread is put in much too late. Still tastes like bread and hasn't soaked any flavor. They could keep it all in the oven a few minutes longer so it's got that traditional baked quality.   The boyfriend ordered eggs Benny which he seemed to enjoy. I had the French toast which was much larger than I thought haha. I got the one with the white chocolate cinnamon sauce which tastes pretty good! The toast was a bit burned and lacked real flavor. Tastes like white bread grilled after a quick batter dip. Still, I found it was a nice breakfast :)  Service here is nice. The waitress was a bit cold and unfriendly at times but the hostesses would come check up on you which was a nice touch.   I definitely want to come back and try some dinner/lunch savory dishes. But it's a nice place. Good, but not special or outstanding. Nice cafe to visit once in a while if you're hanging out in Ajax.  *Wish they wouldn't use undiluted Windex to clean the tables... Smells heavily while we're trying to eat.. but nice that they really do keep the place very clean**"}
{"text":"If there were a possible 0. This place deserves it. I guess I'll say the 1 star is for the name. An attractive name that sounds really good and inviting  even te photo on the front page of the website looks very healthy and trendy. Don't be fooled as we were.  The lowest quality food and highest prices. These people don't know a thing about cooking. Dennis might have been a better choice. Unfortunately we are not from Canada and this was our first visit in Toronto so we didn't know any better.  We were fooled by the name and picture as I said before.  My heart S and went to the bathroom and came back disgusted. I asked what's wrong  he sadly replied bathroom very dirty and roaches crawling on the floor. That's when I stoped eating and we paid and left. This was a very bad experience to say the least"}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Family friendly: 4  Nice place for breakfast/brunch, food quality is better than Egg Smart/Cora. Price is reasonable. Lots of selections and daily specials.  Relaxing environment nice for coffee or drink with friends. Service may be slow."}
{"text":"So, we have been trying to find a good breakfast place in Oakville, which you wouldn't think would be difficult. Let me tell you it has been until now. Wow!  The service was fantastic and the food as well. I had the eggs Benedict, my husband had the breakfast Cuban sandwich (a must order) and our son had the Carmel banana French toast. Just a couple tips, if your child will not eat the entire order and you will take the rest home, ask for the syrup on the side. Also, ask the server to have the eggs in the eggs Benedict cooked a little more if you don't like the egg white runny.  Thank you symposium cafe. Thank you. See you tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch twice and their portions are large and they have a lot of options.  As you walk in it smells amazing, but sometimes the lines are very long.  The only negative is that their service is a little slow."}
{"text":"The only thing that took longer than getting any service was the 30 minute waiting for our breakfast. There was no more than 20 people inside and it took at least 20 minutes for a server to even make any sort of eye contact with us. I got scrambled eggs and my girlfriend got an omelette. Both of which had the exact same texture. Both were dry. Both lacked any sort of taste. My server never came back to check on our meals or once offer to top off my coffee, so I had to ask another server to get me more coffee and remove my plate. To top it off, I asked for Eggs, potatoes and a fruit cup. No meat and no toast. They charged me for the most expensive 3 egg breakfast and then charged me 4.50 for the fruit cup and 1.50 for fruit. When I informed the server he said there was nothing he could do since it's all done over the computer . This has been 2 awful experiences in a row at this restaurant, and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Moved close by and was excited to try the brunch but was HUGELY disappointed. The worst omelette and Benedict we've had. The coffee was not fresh and Freshly squeezed OJ was super sweetened.   Nice space though so would go in for cake and drinks but definitely not for their food."}
{"text":"I have been to Symposium in Thornhill 3 times on weekends in the past 6 weeks.  What is interesting is that I have a symposium restaurant near where I live but have never been there because no parking.  Every time I was at Symposium in Thornhill the service was attentive & excellent and the food was very good.  I was surprised by the number of people who bring their small children in here and the number of groups of people say 8-10 who come in.  The patio was very busy.  This location I found the owner or manager always went around to every table and said hi and made sure everything was ok.  I am very impressed with their operation and not surprised they were voted last year # 1 franchise in the hospitality business.  Trevor Jones Barracuda Music & Talent Management Linkedin"}
{"text":"YUCK!! Just returned from lunch here, had the club sandwich, What a lousy lunch, the bacon on the sandwich was so small I could not taste it, the turkey was disgusting, some sort of greasy old pressed meat ( tasted like it's been in the fridge for the last 5 years). I visited this place a year ago.....now I know why I've never been back!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for dessert and it had a great menu and it satisfied us.  not many places to go out for a late night snack or dessert in Ajax.  I'd come here again! great service"}
{"text":"I've been here twice after my last review. The service has been worse and worse. It is so slow including the food after we ordered. The salmon salad I order wasn't good either. The fish seems old and not cooked well."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and I'd say it definitely wasn't as great as the last time. If you generally follow my reviews, I review from start to finish and you might even laugh once or twice. Anyways.. to the review..  Lunch on a weekday with two friends, lots of parking near symposium café. Went in and I was not greeted, I went and found my friend who got there earlier and had a booth. The server never really asked if we were ready to order for about 20 minutes. Now, this is tricky because some customers complain about servers rushing them to order - but 20 minutes? Thankfully, we were waiting on a friend who not yet arrived yet. However, I find it strange it would take so long for the server to even ask.  After the last of our party arrived, I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries ($1.50 extra), mayo on the side and a corona with a lime (I was flattered that the server asked me for ID, because it hadn't happened in a long while).  When the food came to the table, I noticed right away the plates were all cracked and chipped! They didn't look good at all. The burger was alright, but the sweet potato fries? They gave me such a tiny portion. It was either comparable or less than McDonald's small sized fries.  The servers never came to check on our table and ask if we were doing alright.  Anyways, I requested the full bill because I hadn't seen my friends in a while and I thought I'd treat them. Everything is pretty standard so far, I pay, and we sit and talk some more.  About 20 minutes later, the server comes and says, \"oh, sorry, we forgot to actually charge you for the corona, do you mind?\"  Well, no, I don't mind because I did drink my beer but things are not smooth and aren't like a well-oiled machine here. Additionally, it wasn't busy - the last time I came here it was much better.   2.5/5 If you need something to eat, sure. But I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for drinks and desert. This place is pretty good for drinks because they have a daily drinks deal. Every day they have a new special. Make sure to check the menu before going. They have a decent amount of standard beers on tap, and there is plenty of good seating. The patio is pretty nice too. The ambience is pretty nice as well, and the music is similar to elevator, so no loud music to interrupt your discussions.  We had some ice cream crepes for desert. I would say that this is a great place to have a drink and catch up with friends. I didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that. Overall,  it is a pretty relaxed location. I enjoyed it quite a bit."}
{"text":"So after over a year this place is back on my go to spot for amazing drinks in the cozy lounge area,\"! This place went thru a management and team chance and it improved a lot! Service was outstanding, the food, drinks and desserts were delicious! Had the steak wrap with sweet potato fries and side salad and everything was cooked to perfection and pipping hot! We did not wait at all to be seated as it happened in the past! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are ok Friday night in the summer you'll get to actually chill on the little patio they have. Their breakfast is pretty alright too. Nothing special tho I would love to see them update the menu to have tastier/healthier options."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family celebrating a birthday, the waitress took forever to get our drinks, and take our order!!!! We got there just by 7:30 and didn't eat until 9!!!!!!! The food took forever to come out, the table beside us came after and got their food before us and finished  before we got ours. When the food did come, they forgot one thing I ordered so had to wait even longer for that, and I got the flank steak house salad. WAY TO MUCH LETTUCE. A tiny piece of steak, very tiny like 4 bites, and giant onions not even cut, AWFUL! Not coming back, going to aurthurs or burger bar or jacks instead!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Chicken parmesian was delicious. Was able to share between two people. Ordered the chocolate devine. was supee sweet but still good. wish I got more icecream scoops but was yummy."}
{"text":"came with many friends. Food was great! Huge portions.. a bit pricy but it is what it is. Great atnosphere.. servers were friendly. Food was delicious. I had the sandwhiches.. massive portion but still managed to finish it since i ordred with a salad.. husband got the parmagiana chicken sandwhich.. soo good so filling.  he didnt even finish his fries.. so much food. but it was really good."}
{"text":"enjoyed it on a valentines night. food was delicious. wish desert had more icecream. but was satisfying none the less. I would come back. I havent had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"We came here on a lunch meeting spontaneously, believing it would be wayy better than we experienced. It wasn't my first time here but the experience was definitely a downer for everyone involved.   Food; the food was OK. And no more than that. Nothing special. We started with water, all of our cups were super dirty and looked like it had been drank from before. I had ordered a Greek salad with Salmon - it looked good but the salmon was over cooked, very dry, and had absolutely no flavour. My bf got a breakfast meal and he was content with his. Our friend got the chicken pesto, and he was satisfied with it as well. We also ordered 3 Cesar's, they all came out differently, one was more watered down than the other, and the little toothpick with the pickle, olive and lemon also had zero taste. Never had such a terrible Caesar.    Cleanness; the seats were wet, I'm not sure with what, we cleaned it ourselves. Like I said the waters given were all soo dirty, and to top it off, the utensils were DISGUSTING! We sent them back three times! One of the utensils looked like it had some kind of ear wax - mold growth on it. The waiter kept saying it's water marks but I really wish I had taken a picture to show how distrusting it was. God forbid someone put that in there mouth without checking.   Service; was terrible. We were greeted and told to sit anywhere. It took a very long time- over 20 mins for sure- until we placed our order. Our server took our order, finally - then disappeared. She did not say she was leaving or on break or anything at all. It got to a point that we called on another server to help us, and he just took over taking care of us because we just kept calling him. He wasn't that attentive to us, I suppose since we weren't really his table to take care of.   Price; definitely more on the pricy side for what we got. We go to 'nice' restaurants because we expect good food, clean utensils and good service - this was definitely not the case here. The portions in the meals were mediocre, and I do not feel that they actually cared for the presentation of the food or the reputation of them as a food supplier. We ended up paying $100 for everything, I usually don't care for the money if it's worth it, but I do not feel like my money went to a good place at all.   I gave them a two because the food was decent, definitely has room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place is great for dates. I come here often with my gf and I love their variety of food and drink. Service is always good, too."}
{"text":"Awesome place to relax and have a cup of coffee. I think I like the cake is the best. I had triple berry shortcake. Very nice. And awesome décor."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday- got a great seat on the patio and had an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a restaurant where you don't feel welcomed , and you feel like the waiters are doing YOU a favour by being there? Then symposium oakridges is for you. First time we went, terribly long service...over two hours (with small kids!). We chalked it up to opening week. Second outing, service was quick, but the owner was visibly present. Tonight was horrid!! Barely acknowledged, I had to move our dirty plates to a clean table, and none of the other staff that were milling about and chatting even offered to help.  One thing I will say. You get quick service when you finally get fed up and stand up to leave. I noticed that there were a lot of disgruntled looking customers, all standing around waiting for their bill.  Boo!  It's not as if the place is cheap... I would rather spend my money where I feel valued.  Don't even get me started with the number of flies in the restaurant.  I must have burned a few hundred calories swatting them away....eeeeeewwwww!!  I would have mentioned this to our waiter, if we would have seen him.  Booooooooo :("}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delish big portions!  We ordered chicken wings, pulled pork quesadilla and fetichini Alfredo with chicken. We were stuffed but couldn't pass up the BOGO dessert offer.  Both cake slices were so yummy and of the chocolate variety.  Some of the add on items like tea ($3) and adding chicken to the pasta ($5.50), I find a bit higher than average.  But overall, a good value.  I took advantage of the bar special and ordered a $4 vodka soda.  Settling the bill, tends to take a bit longer than necessary (both times I have been it is about 15 mins from the time the bill is dropped to the time the server comes back to settle)."}
{"text":"Excellent value for your money. Always really good food. Service sometimes slow depending on the person but good overall. I love the food here. Their burger is great. The fries are always fresh. And often we find that we end up being the first to use a ketchup or mustard bottle (seal is still on bottle which means its fresh and not refilled with other products or thinned out etc). Really enjoy coming here with the kids. They love the kids menu!  Very kid friendly in a casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice setting. Sever a total fool. Ordered a veggie burger. After first bite realized it was meat. The server was not even apologetic. Asked me \"can we make you another burger?\" What a silly question.... Lost my appetite after that!"}
{"text":"Came with friends for a quick hot beverage after dinner before heading to the theatres for a late show. Service was good. Nice decor and atmosphere. Prices are decent. Haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"I went today with my daughter for brunch. This is the first time we we're there.  POSITIVE POINTS: OUR waitress was amazing. She was friendly and fast to serve and take our order. She let us know about all thes specials. Our coffee was just brewed and was a good cup of joe. They had plenty if cream on the table for us. Our food came fast and was DELICIOUS. My daughter is very picky with her food and she was happy with her eggs benidict. I had the goat cheese and spinach omlet. It was very good. The manager came and made sure we we're very happy with things.  NEGATIVE POINTS: I ONLY FOUND ONE... the pushing of alcohol drinks. It made me a little uncomfortable with the pushiness of it. It should only be asked once if any alcohol drinks would be liked. We we're asked 3 different wayz"}
{"text":"The restaurant has an awesome atmosphere along with nice decor. The staff are quite friendly. I'm not too sure what people are talking about when they say the waiter \"interrupts\" their conversation. I guess if they left you alone then someone would complain about the staff not being attentive enough.   Anyway, the food is spectacular however, I'm not too impressed with the portions. Nonetheless, it's quite good and delicious. If you are in the area, you must try it. It's one of the edgy cafe we got in Ajax!!"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable, food and drinks amazing. This place is newly opened, with a beautiful Renaissance mural interior, cozy chairs, and great ambiance. Perfect for business meetings or getting together with friends.   I tried their Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of fries. Arrived hot and quickly, only waited about 10 minutes for the meal to come. Which was great as I was on lunch from work, and needed to be quick. The sandwich was amazing, I believe a must try for anyone!  They also have huge specials all week long, which is interesting. When I arrived I was told it was Martini Wednesdays, 31 different martinis for only $4.25. Ummm Yes! Will have to come back after work and perhaps make this a regular until I got through all the martinis at least haha.   Also, when entering you will immediately notice the huge cake display. Don't come here on a diet, indulge, as their cake selection is huge. I tried the Sky High Carrot Cake, and let me tell you, it was a meal in itself. I took it to work with me and shared it with 3 other staff members. My new favourite cake, cream cheese icing, cranberries in a carrot cake batter, and walnut crust. I think my heart just stopped, but in a good way.   Overall, really enjoyed myself, and I believe if you enjoy selection, great desserts, fantastic service, and a HUGE, I mean HUGE alcohol selection... This place is for you haha."}
{"text":"The food was definitely not great. My friend got the steak and it was room temperature. She also asked for medium rare but the steak was well done. My pasta had no flavour and the garlic bread was old and stale. Not to mention, the prices here are not cheap so the food was a disappointment. The service was also really slow, even though it wasn't a busy time. I think we waited 30 minutes before our food arrived. I understand if they are short staffed in the kitchen or if there was an issue. However, our waitress didn't follow up with us at all while we waited, so we had no idea what's going on. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I agree with Chris C.  The food and services are decent.  The ambiance is good.  The wine list is passable for a bistro, though maybe not good enough for a lounge.  The price is higher than I am used to.    Overall, the food quality ranged from average to good.  I ordered a French Onion soup as starter.  It was hearty and not too salty.  It could have more cheese.  For main, I ordered a steak wrap.  The wrap was loaded with lots of steak strips.  The steak strips were fresh, tender and flavourful.  i liked that the chef didn't go cheap on ingredients.  The wrap was a tad too saucy. The juice leaked, and it quickly became messy to eat the wraps.  My dining mate ordered a Haddock sandwich, which actually came in a bun, not two slices of bread.  He said the fish fillets were tender, moist, fresh enough (no hint of fishiness).  He wished the fish fillets were bigger.  We ordered a Chocolate Banana Split as dessert.  It was good portioned, too.  This restaurant is strategically located in the Angus Glen neighborhood, just north of the Unionville neighborhood.  And there isn't another true Western dining venue in these 2 hoods.  I think they can charge these prices as long as the millionaires in these 2 hoods are willing to pay.  Affordability is not an issue to them."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this establishment again. I actually had to clear tables because it was almost like they forgot about us...The service was awful, Lattes were cold and even the barista said that the staff had left them on the counter for 10 minutes...she made us new ones, son and niece burnt their hands on the hot water in he washroom, most of the staff seemed to not care about anything. We were there with 40 people for an event and it was apparent they were not prepared...to top it off, 2 last things - 1. we found a suction cup in one of the jids bowl of ice cream and 2. male staff walked in on women's  washroom for a clean up and did not wait for the washroom to be empty.   Noticed one other thing as well. The place had only been given a conditional pass by the board of health on Sept 4th, 2014...will gladly discuss with anyone from this establishment about our experience today."}
{"text":"I tend to review when things are either great or very bad.  As the single star indicates, my experience at Symposium was the latter.   7 adults and 3 children met for brunch today.   4 adults were served their food an hour+ after arriving while the remaining 3 waited an additional 45 minutes for theirs.    Of the 4 initially served, two omelettes were stone cold, although the plates were warm so it was obvious they had been sitting under an ineffective warmer for ages.   The cold omelettes were removed, subjected to microwave treatment and then returned, which for my seat mate meant the microwaving of everything on her plate including the salad, fruit and toast.   If you have never eaten microwaved eggs, salad, fruit or toast, please spare yourself and don't.   The 3 kids meals of grilled cheese were not grilled and better resembled a cold cheese sandwich with one slice of crappy cheese each.   The waitress kept telling us the kitchen was having a bad day, which happens, but she took no responsibility for our experience other than saying it was the kitchens fault.    Why her excuse rings hallow is that other than being friendly and often overly so, she was not very good at her job.   We sat without cutlery, water and coffee/tea was not delivered after multiple requests, plates were not cleared, request to speak with the manager never materialized in any action until we got up to go look for one.   The net, of the 10 dishes ordered, 3 were comped.  It should have been 5 - the 2 microwaved omelettes as well as the 3 dishes which were delivered 45 minutes later than the others.   PS - we were celebrating a cousins soon-to-be-born second baby.   Our reservations were made in advance and of the 3 adults not delivered their brunch within 1.5 hrs, was the 9 month pregnant lady.     PPS. There were two managers on the floor and neither of them came to our table to check in or apologize   PPPS  It wasn't busy and there were a substantial number of open tables although our waitress kept telling us they were sooooooo busy   ???  Perhaps dinner is better but if you are considering brunch, I urge you to reconsider."}
{"text":"First time visiting Symposium Cafe since I heard that their patio/outside dining was pet friendly. Turns out I was wrong - the family attended the second time and when we brought our pet, we were told that the pet is not allowed in the patio and therefore we had to leave. Yes, the waitress told us that we had to leave in a firm manner that there was no other choice. Alternatively, I offered a solution to the waitress stating that what if it was \"outside\" of the restaurant premise (ie. on the other side of the patio fence) then would it suffice? The waitress agreed that we can do that. That is one problem solved that apparently the customer service industry here in Symposium does not offer. Why is a customer thinking of solutions to the issue instead of the restaurant? It doesn't tend to me that they are trying to keep customer's business.  Irrespective of that, we've waited about 15 minutes for our waiter or waitress to come to us and still nothing to avail. I saw a waiter serving another table and who so happen to walk by ours and asked if we are doing okay. Despite my patience was waning and after responding to him politely that we are okay and that we are also ready to order - the waiter used a passive aggressive sarcastic tone to tell me \"Well I am not your waiter\" and gave me a cut eye and walked away.  I have NEVER been so insulted by restaurant staff that I offended this waiter who clearly after the fact was not servicing us, because I told him that we were ready to order. This waiter had completely ruined our family atmosphere and mood to even give this restaurant any higher rating than what it deserves - a 0 in technicality but 1 since it only goes as low as that. Luckily I was in a good enough mood to dismiss his horrendous attitude, I waited for our 25 minute waitress to come to us and provide us water.  One of us ordered the 10oz steak which is 29.99 and it was very odd that the steak looked really \"plastic\" as if it came out of a model demo set. When we started to cut into it, the meat was dry and it was overcooked to our liking. When we asked the waitress (which I had to physically go inside the restaurant to call them because they'd rather chit chat near the kitchen than be at the service of the customers), she kindly gave me a new order. This steak that came out from the kitchen was the difference between Heaven and Earth. Clearly our first steak was NOT fresh, most likely reheated from another person, and hopefully that we did not catch on to it and that we just ate it.  Since all of our meals were about $25-$30 each person and we had five people eating, I want to say that for what you pay - this restaurant and the quality of food WAS NOT up to par. The service was terrible, the wait was long, the attitude was horrendous - nothing strikes me as wanting to come back.  I really hope they fix their server's attitude because with their snarky sarcastic replies - no one from either ends is going to be happy, especially if you're going to charge customers an arm and a leg for a \"mediocre\" experience."}
{"text":"Went on a regular Sunday for lunch and even though the restaurant were just about 1/3 full and we still need to wait more than 40 minutes for our food (just 2 burgers, a chicken wrap and 2 kids meal).  Presentation and taste of food was just average.  Foods were overpriced for this kind of portion.  Super slow services, no air conditioning and dirty bathroom.  I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a huge fan on Symposium Cafe, but this location may make me a convert. Popped in today for bkfst. Was greeted almost immediately by a hostess, who steered us towards a vacant booth (it was in an odd location...right by the door...and looked like an added booth as it stuck out past the door entrance), so it may not be an ideal seat choice on a cold winters day, but for this day, there were no issues with it.  Our server Rosie (according to our bill) was fantastic. She was friendly, efficient and engaging...it's nice to have a server that actually seems to like their job. Food was typical Symposium fare...I truly wish they would change their home fries to actual potatoes, rather than the stuff they serve...that was the only disappointing thing on our plate. Portion size was big...we couldn't finish it all. Bkfst was ordered off their daily specials...3 eggs, bacon, rye bread, home fries...$7.95. My dining companion had the same except his was an omelette. Great location (close to where I live), superb service, above average quality food....we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this chain another try (I've been to the one on Woodbridge) for brunch this morning.  The decor is nice...comfortable booths...ambient lighting....service friendly.  I ordered the French Toast....it was cooked correctly and flavourful. The accompanying bacon (3 strips) were cooked the way I like them...a bit crispy. The only real complaint is that you get table syrup (Log Cabin) which, considering the price of breakfast ($10.95), completely cheapens the meal. Huge disappointment.  My brunch companion ordered the Eggs Benedict. They were cooked the way he asked (well done) and he cleaned his plate (usually a good sign)). The home fries were those store bought kind...another disappointment considering the price of the meal.  The above breakfasts with 1 coffee and 1 tea, taxes, came to $30.84.  Would I go back...if the neighbourhood I might....but I won't do the drive from Woodbridge just to come here again. There are better places out there."}
{"text":"Food is good but one of the staff was super rude to us. She raised her voice at us because we didn't know we couldn't order an extra burger without ordering a drink. I don't believe we should be yelled at and told we were wrong as a customer. We will definitely not return."}
{"text":"My family and I come here semi often I guess.   Let me just say, it is what it is.  Have you ever seen the movie \"Waiting\"? that's what this Symposium location reminds me of.  I totally expect sub par food when I come here, so I normally just order a Burger and a Beer or some Cappuccinos while I work on my computer (free WiFi).  This place has the oddest music by the way and it's Super SUPER loud.  I don't know who is in control of the tunes, but he/she should be promptly removed from their duties as acting \"DJ\"... They play anywhere from hardcore reggae to Frank Sinatra in a single night, not to mention the music is looped.  I heard the same playlist twice while I was there.  Now I know I am ranting about something so small, but music sets the tone... and this place is tone def"}
{"text":"This place needs some serious improvements.  When we dropped by here for lunch on a Sunday, there were probably 6 waiters working along with around 12-15 customers.  The place was more than sufficiently staffed, however the service was horrendously terrible.  They forgot our food and one was delivered first before the second one arrived.  The quality of food was as bad as the service.  I got the mushroom swiss burger and it was no different than the quality of a burger served at a fast food restaurant.  Processed frozen meet patty which tasted like cardboard while eating it."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've eaten here a few times and finally decided that their food is not that great. Its so boringly average. Their quality of meat is poor. Their gravy was lukewarm and lumpy. Their mash is mediocre. I enjoyed the salmon salad and the shrimp fusilli, but then again, those dishes don't require a high level of execution.  I do, however, like the large variety of cakes they offer here. Their carrot cake wasn't my favourite, but you'll surely get a lot of it! (5 layers! hot diggity.) My favourites were their chocolate cake that had layers of cream cheese, mousse and brownie. Para-para-paradise.   Service is good, quick and attentive. We were checked up on pretty often. Ask to be seated outside on the patio if you don't mind the gas guzzling cars driving by."}
{"text":"Symposium is one of my favourite restaurant chains. It's the type of restaurant that sort of hits anything you're really looking for last minute.  Brunch? Check. GIANT Martini List? Check. Sweets, sweets, and more sweets? Check. Good daily specials? Check. Generic yummy stuff? Check.  I find the service at this location a bit hit & miss. On my most recent visit, I popped by (sans reservation) with a party of 9 at 10pm. The first guy to greet us wasn't very friendly and didn't seem excited about the prospect of a party of 9. Though the restaurant had TONS of space he told us he wasn't sure if he could fit us all and went to check with someone. The someone in question said no problem, and they quickly put some tables together for us and we were seated.  Our main server, who was the initial unpleasant fellow, was not around too often. When he was, we found him a bit rude. The other server that was assisting him, however, was sweet as pie and super friendly and helpful. We hoped that at least some of the tip would go to her, because she was the one that deserved the tips, for sure.  Food was good as per usual. Sundays are 2 for 1 cake slices so most of us took advantage of that. Go for the Chocolate Mojito cheesecake. The portion is GIANT and it's ridiculously delicious. Rude server #1 insisted on reminding us that we could not take the cakes to go, and could only eat them there (even though none of us wanted them to go.) My one friend couldn't finish his, so friendly server #2 said no problem, and got him a takeout box. Hmm.  They have a great dessert menu, so this is a perfect place to pop by if you're craving late night desserts, and want to avoid the madness of Spin or Demetres."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. The host, and waitress were extremely attentive and friendly. I had the white chocolate cinnamon French toast and it was delicious! The mimosa I had was so-so, but not bad. Prices were good and portion siZes were great! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible food, poor value. Will never return. The calamari was deep fried junk and zero calamari. The tacos were horrible . The wings too deep fried."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a friend around 10pm. I wanted a quiet place to just hang out and chat... perhaps get dessert. I didn't want to go to the usual Demetres because I knew it was going to be super crowded so we decided to come check out Symposium.  I've been to the Waterloo Symposium and I really liked the decor. When we stepped into this one, I also really liked the decor and environment. All the chairs are like arm chairs/sofas and super comfy and chill. It looks maybe 75% full but it was pretty peaceful (if it wasn't for the woman that was talking super loud beside us!! which isn't really Symposium's fault..)  I ordered a hot chocolate and the mocha crunch cake. The hot chocolate was super sweet and not hot enough.. =\ The cake was super big portion but it wasn't quite as good as I remember.  Even tho the stuff I ordered was not great, I give 3 stars because I really like the ambiance. I can't think of any other place that is like it, so I would definitely come back again. Also, our waiter was really nice and friendly and there is free wifi :)"}
{"text":"Best place for sangria and breakfast! Anything else is a toss up. I've had pasta there and it sucked! Service is usually pretty great and the patios amazing in the summer."}
{"text":"Ordered calamari/bruschetta/18 oz beer.  $13 for the calamari. $10 for the bruschetta. $7 for the beer.  The beer was worth it. The 2 apps were not!  Located in a God-forsaken place and their appetizers cost just the same as if you were in Toronto!    The taste & presentation were negligible! Servings were pathétic too!   Waste of money that even the ambiance can't make up for it.  Will not even think of going back!"}
{"text":"So many mixed reviews I found the food and service to be pretty decent but the price is on the higher side  Pulled pork flat bread $12.95 - loads of pulled pork with caramelized onions and pesto sauce on a thin crust flat bread. It was really good and I could have finished this myself since portion was pretty small. Its like the size of an ipad mini (5 stars).  1lb chicken wings $13.95 - decent at best. Came with the standard carrots and celery sticks but with no dipping sauce. Also noticed that we were only give drumsticks rather than a mix with chicken wings (3 stars).  Milk shake and ice mocha 4.95 and $3.95 - avoid these drinks. Mocha tasted like chocolate milk and the milk shake tasted like melted ice cream (2 stars).  Caramel cheese cake $7.95 - pretty good but nothing worth mentioning (3 stars).  I would only come back for the pulled pork flat bread"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars for sunday brunch.  Service was always so-so - very seemingly inexperienced staff.  Usually get the benedicts or the omelettes.  Omelettes are made so-so and over a span of about six months have noticed the quality just drop.  Last visit I had a benedict and it was so disappointing - aside from the large hair atop the plate, the eggs were 'poached' to hard boiled.  Even the homefries that accompany the breakfasts are over-fried.  Throughout breakfast tables that are empty sit with all the plates and leftovers of previous customers.   Gross.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I've been to the symposium in Waterloo and Guelph, and had very high expectations going into this one. My friend and I went for dessert, and was sad to see that there was only a small little display of cakes at the counter, whereas the number of cakes in the Waterloo location would take about 3 minutes for the servers to list them all to you (and they memorized all the cakes every day). I would most certainly recommend those symposium locations.  For this location the lighting was too dim for my liking, and the selection was too small.  The employees seemed very fresh, as the girl struggled to squeeze the whipped cream onto the plate nicely and the male server I had gave my friend and I a strange look when we said we were just there for dessert.  All in all I was very disappointed. I would recommend going for bubble tea instead."}
{"text":"I have long been a fan of Symposium Cafe ever since I first visited the London, Ontario location and after that I was a regular at the Mississauga location.  But, last night, I visited the Thornhill location for the second time since it opened up with my wife and ordered the chicken tenders, cake for dessert and coffee.  I was very disappointed when I had the chicken tenders as I have never ate such dry chicken, it almost felt like it was old chicken that was reheated (which could be true as I had to throw up as soon as I got home) but regardless, I did not complain and moved on to the dessert and I could not believe that the waitress would not even notice how dry and stale the cake slice she served us was.   I could not even slice it with the fork, thats how hard the slice was.  I had to call her over and show her that my fork would not even go through the slice and how could she expect us to eat this? I did not even want a replacement slice as I would not trust any food at that location.  The waitress pretended to be shocked as well when she saw how hard it was and gave us a story about how she took the same cake slice home last night and it was fine but today it must have gone stale.  I can easily bet that the cake slice was over a week old.  I would have really hoped that the management for a new location would make sure that they create an impression in that community but after my experience here, I would never return to another Symposium Cafe."}
{"text":"***3.5 stars***   Okayy so iv been here a handful of times already so i should already have written a review by now, but i haven't so here goes nothin.   The reason i keep coming here is for the food, i find it tasty and i find the prices to be okay. Iv been here for breakfast which they serve until 4pm everyday. I do find they have good portions and their peameal bacon is really good & under $10 too so thats good. Iv also been here for dinner in which i had their California Chicken sandwich which is so tasty and filling and that was about $14. Also have tried their classic waffle which comes with ice cream, with strawberries & bananas...im definately a sucker for desserts but you can take my word thats its really good, which was about $11 if im not mistaken.   Now for the service i will say its okay...nothing spectacular or over the top. I do feel like they should smile more often especially when being greeted with customers. Thats why i gave them 3.5 stars. Also they do have gluten friendly options if you are gluten free/sensitive."}
{"text":"John our server treated us well. He explained the menu and suggested great appetizers and drinks to start. Our chicken dishes came to the table hot and tasty. Vegetables were crisp and hot. Mimosas went down well and the strawberry inside is a classy touch. Don't forget to try the creme braille as it's dynamite."}
{"text":"Ordered the fettuccine alfredo  pasta here and it was really watered down.. Noodles were alright nothing too special. But right after I had left and thankfully I live nearby I had a bad stomach ache...   Was feeling fine up until I had finished that pasta. I wouldn't go back here. For the price of the pasta you pay $13 and results me in getting a stomach ache I wouldn't waste my money or time at this place again."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth like myself, come for the buy one slice get one free every Sunday. But notice the fine print.... You also must buy a hot drink to get the deal. Just a heads up :)"}
{"text":"Like what Jennifer mentioned, I, too, got really excited that Symposium Cafè was opening.   It has opened about a month ago - i just got back from a business trip and haven't ate and thought this would be a great time to pay a visit at this location.   I have been going to Symposium since I was in my teens -  before it was Symposium, it was called Plantations.   Ordered today's special, manager served us,  and I was very pleased with my overall experience at this location. From juicy burger to ice cream sandwich dessert.   I am looking forward to the breakfast menu. =)"}
{"text":"Love it here!! The staff is always great & the menu is extensive. Ample seating. We enjoyed the Jazzy/reggae music on our first visit (sat night). The kitchy \"Italian\" decor is interesting....it's kind of like an italy themed diner I suppose lol Just dont go expecting only italian fare bc the menu is variety city!!  So far on our visits, we've tried:   -seafood pasta w/alfredo sauce - Delish!!  -sweet thai chili chicken & spinach dip on special - chicken was a bit dry but good with the sauce. Spinach dip was not good at all.  -cookie sundae - AMAZING!!! warming cookie with chocolate oozing from inside  - wings - big, good portion  -excellent service, quick to get our food even when the restaurant is packed & manager (short Caribbean guy) is great!!!!  They also have themed days so u can get great deals on their awesome dessert menu, burgers, pastas, etc! I have no idea why ppl insist on going to the same old restaurants with the same old food when u can come to awesome places like this & get something different every time. Havent tried the crepes or waffles for dessert as yet but we will be back!! They also serve breakfast specials until 4pm.  What are u waiting for??"}
{"text":"I went to this location and felt I had the best service ever from Rivka  She was constantly polite and on top of everything Great experience!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for brunch because Bobby's in Streetsville had a long wait. We had a large group of 8 people, but they were able to find us a table within 5 minutes. I had the Cuban breakfast sandwich with home fries and it was really good. Both items had flavours that really stood out and and were extremely enjoyable. Within our group we had different people who had the eggs Benedict and waffles, but they stated that they were nothing special. If you are going here for brunch which is open until 4pm, have the Cuban sandwich. Also their coffee isn't that great.   The service wasn't that great, the server was nice and friendly but it took a long time for food and drinks to come out and there didn't seem to be any order to how items came out."}
{"text":"Here is a live story from our experience at the Symposium in Richmond Hill 2 hours ago. Actually we are still in shock. It's our neighborhood coffee place usually. Came with our daughters for a family day brunch. The place is half full plus one large table.  A nice waitress takes our order and than the amazing experience of service begins. After 40 minutes (yap 40) we asked about our order. Talked to the manager who said he will go and check. He went and never came back..... Food still doesn't come, we call him again and now our girls food arrives. woot! (Grilled cheese sandwich and Belgium waffle.  45 minutes to prepare! ) But wait. What about mom and Dad? No food. We call the manager who goes again to check. Food arrives. Yeah!!!!!!!!! My husband's burger is burned.  I mean black burned.  My order of eggs benedict with Brie and NO ham, arrives with ham and no Brie. We than call the manager again who looks at us and answer rudely- well we had to take care of that big table and if you want to replace the burger it will take 15-20 minutes to cook it (seriously ??) My husband  was so starving and the girls almost finished their food so he actually asked to get the burned burger back. And the manager was fine with it. Meanwhile,  my eggs got back! Yeahhh finally I'm going to eat. Surprise- they took the old eggs (remember? The ones with the ham) and put them on a new bun and throw a piece of cheese on top. You know what guys? When you play all these games, the eggs and potatoes get cold!!!! Finally they succeeded to break me. I cancelled my order.  The sweet waitress was out of words. We asked for the bill and she told us there is no bill. The attitude of the manager Ismael Jimenez,  his disrespect and arrogant approach, is the reason we will never step in again. Not the food, not the incompetents of the kitchen. His attitude.  Although Symposium is a chain, the atmosphere was always of your neighborhood place to go. Until you will train your staff that great service experience is provided when you see and hear your customer, and when something goes wrong (and things go wrong), you don't turn your back from your customer and walk,  but take responsibility and just make an effort to fix it, you won't see us coming in. Plantty of places with regular food which taste great because of exceptional service."}
{"text":"The quality and service seem to have gone down. The food this visit seem mediocre and service very long even before the place got busy."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good symposium, service and food-wise. We didn't have to wait for a table and it was Saturday night. We were celebrating a friend's bday and wanted to order some dessert. We got the chocolate divine with waffle and east meets west crepe. It was very good. How can you go wrong with ice cream, brownie, fruit and waffle & crepe? The server was attentive and friendly--he would frequently check in on us to see how we were doing.  All in all, very similar vibe as other symposiums in the city. I'd return for dessert anytime!"}
{"text":"Two stars here for me. I came here for lunch with my dad one afternoon with somewhat high expectations after hearing good things about the Symposium chain for drinks and desserts. Located in a small plaza off Kennedy, the restaurant looks upscale and put together. Service was on par with the looks. The disappointment was with the food. We ordered a flat bread and burger, both of which tasted like something from a really crappy diner (lacked flavours and even visual appeal). I recall the flat bread itself being poorly baked. I definitely won't be coming back for their food but may consider visiting again for dessert and drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent service, nice ambience, really good food at fair prices.  Decent vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"Its true, where there is no choice.. you go where you can.  Symposium is impressive in it's ability to deliver as all symposiums across the GTA.  However, given the general lack of coffee establishments within a specific radius... you would expect to really own it.  We actually came by with the hungry troop for breakfast.  The menu was delightful and I could not decide what to order.  The food was great if overly sweet.  I would have preferred the caramel sauce on the side so that I could decide how much I wanted to use to drown my waffles (to which I dock a star).  Half way through I had to admit defeat and pass the plate to the hubby dispenser.  As it was not busy, the kids had a field day and the staff were pretty nice and accommodating.  No dirty looks and the like."}
{"text":"The Symposium in Meadowvale Town Centre has the worst service.  We were seated fairly quickly and then completely forgotten.  We were seated for about 15 minutes and not one waiter or waitress would greet us or ask if we would like coffee. A couple of the wait staff smiled at us a couple times and kept right on walking. The last straw was when people who arrived AFTER US WERE GREETED AND SERVED BEFORE US. We left.  I heard the food is good there but I will never know because I'm certainly never going back."}
{"text":"I went here for a date and was pleasantly surprised. Friendly staff, nice tables, good food and at least during our time, live music. The staff let a few of us stay past closing to listen longer and enjoy our time together. Highly recommend!  Only bad thing I can say is I called in and placed a reservation which was confirmed over the phone but they didn't have it when I arrived. However the staff managed to get us a great table still."}
{"text":"Worst flatbread I ever had; cold and tasteless + lazy service. The price range is also above average.   What a waste...."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all. Came here on a Monday night looking to eat dinner and ended up eating desert because I really didn't like anything on their OVER priced menu.   Ended up ordering East meets West crepe and was so disappointed to see the plate they brought to me that consisted of 2 small crepes wrapped around the 2 ice cream scoops. This plate was $9.75 which was well over priced.   They get 2 stars for good service by a server in training. He was very attentive and didn't hold back on asking us if we were okay.   Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Not good. Had dessert, was expensive. Slow server. Upset my girlfriend. Unforgivable. Avoid."}
{"text":"This place is located in Meadowvale Town Centre. They have been well known for their desserts but it has left me dissatisfied slightly as the cakes were not made fresh on site. Our server was really knowledgeable and patient with our order and her turnaround time was pretty fast. The food tasted a little bland in terms of flavour. Prices were slightly high which could explain the amount of people that were visiting."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with my boyfriend. Right away, this restaurant reminds me of Cafe Mirage. Even the menu (especially the dessert) looks very similar to Cafe Mirage.  I got the shrimp fusili and my boyfriend got wings. The portion of the shrimp fusili was quite big and I almost couldn't finish it. I didn't expect the pasta to be al dente and it wasn't which was fine. The actual flavour of the dish was very garlicky which I enjoyed.  The service at this restaurant was average. I like how they have big, comfortable chairs but every time a waitress walks by, she bumps into my seat which can get quite annoying.  I'm interested in trying some of their other stuff on the menu since it's reasonably priced so I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"Loved the food, service, and atmosphere. One of my go to brunch places. The only thing that would make it better is if parking on Yonge street were easier! I especially loved the sausages they had, as there was a hint of sweetness with the savoury."}
{"text":"great new location, close to hwy.400   Very lovely Patio. Daily Specials, left me intrigued to come and try out,  Our server: Margarida was terrific. prompt, attentive and accurate with everything.  Table near ours not so fortunate, there waiter was more like a used car salesman.  Oh well, watch out for that.   the customer ordered something he went inside for 10 minutes then came back and told her they didn't have the item. When she asked why it took so long, he said they just told me now. So she had to choose from the menu all over again, meantime her dates food was already being served to the table quite a small disaster"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch.  The early bird specials are a great deal!  My friend and I enjoyed an omlette, toast, lattes, mimosas and a beautiful slice of red velvet cake.  The food was good, the restaurant's ambience was great, beautifully decorated, and the service was great!  My waiter was nice enough to cover the lattes as a free coffee!  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"meh i went with a group of 4 on wednesday when they have the martini and mussels special $4 martinis are a great deal (hence the 2 stars) - my fav: mango passion the mussels were good too but a bit fishy tasting; we have the ones with asiago we also shared the calamari .. it says it is \"grilled\" and then drizzled with herb butter but they are actually breaded and deep fried these were alright; served with just seafood sauce also had the BBQ chicken pizza - instead of pizza sauce, its BBQ sauce - this was alright; some of the crust was badly burnt; nothing special others at the table had a burger, also alright and the veggie wrap all in all the food was mediocre the service however was TERRIBLE we had one waitress to start; everything we ordered was \"HER FAVOURITE! OMG! SO GOOD!\" and she did not know much about the menu; when we asked about the mussels, she had to go check her sheet; it is the WEEKLY special on wednesdays... she should know about it she also didn't know much about other items like the martinis \"I only know about the one i like the most\" is exactly what she told us i asked for water twice before we got any AND THE RESTAURANT WAS PRAACTICALLY EMPTY then another server brought our food and told us she would be our server her name was Veronica i think  VERONICA IF YOU READ THIS, i am sorry, but your humour comes off rude and not funny first she told us \"we must've done something really bad cause our old server didn't want to serve us any more\" then she came back with drinks and told us to \"eat faster\"cause there wasn't room on the table; when we tried to give her some plates she told us \"well i can't take it with these drinks on my tray\" after my friend finished half his burger she came back and offered him mustard and hot sauce.. a little late no? she also came around 3-4 times to take away the dishes and WE WERE NOT DONE once she just started to take my friend's plate; as she took it she said: \"you're done right\" my friend was NOT done she also wiped the table with a wet cloth while we were still sitting there and eating she also did not understand how to split our bill; we told her to split it by couple with each couple having 3 martinis and to put an app on each bill... this was confusing for her and she returned twice to confirm honestly, the worst service i have ever recieved EVER and i eat out a lot"}
{"text":"We waited 50 mins for our food. The order wasn't right and brought half the order at a time. Omelettes were burnt. Restaurant was not every half full. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1:20 PM today. We were taking my dear mother out for lunch (she's 95). It was Sunday afternoon and it was busy because every seat was in use. Soon after arriving my wife began murmuring under her breath for us to leave as the wait might be too long. On the other side of the coin, I felt like being a little more patient as I recognized a few things that would make me feel comfortable there. There were paintings on the ceiling and the seats looked very comfortable to sit in. The atmosphere said to me \"be comfortable\".  Time passed fairly quickly and we were put in a booth with plenty of room. It always felt spacious right from the start and that never changed.  After we ate, mom, my wife and I all agreed that our food orders were cooked perfectly and presented to us with perfection. Also, we were totally satisfied with what we ordered. Personally, I had the eggs benedict. I've never had better. Plus I want to come back and try a different variation of this the next time we are there. The price of our meals was very reasonable.  Our server was excellent. He was a young handsome man named Omar. He made us feel comfortable and instantly we felt quite at home. Omar was always there when we needed him. I had a question about the different condiments that they serve. Without asking Omar presented some samples for us to taste. It was a nice touch and I'll remember Omar for that.  When I am that satisfied I will always look for the manager to tell them about the experience. His name was Nathan and he was the owner. I wasn't surprised to hear the success story that he was experiencing at this time. He said the previous owners were not doing things properly to retain customers. Through his management of the restaurant and the great efforts of his wonderful staff, that things have changed now. I don't know what the difference might be as this was my first time at the Symposium. Knowing that makes me want to suggest to you that if you have been here before in 2016 and before and were not satisfied then, then why not give them another try now?   The bottom line is that we were satisfied customers."}
{"text":"It's not me, it's you, Symposium.   Again with the interesting service...? My same group of girlfriends and I returned here this evening for a mixture of appys, desserts, tea and brews. While my beer & carrot cake were good, I still can't get over how poor their service is.  Although we hadn't asked for our bills, I can understand a shift change and having to settle up. What irked me is that after about 45 minutes of being server-less, we were given the boot! Our previous server had said there was no rush and that they were open until 1am for business. The owner, who possesses poor people skills, came to ask how things were. My girlfriend responded saying if we had a server, we'd be better. We sat for some time and could've enjoyed a second pint. He then told us it was time to go because another reservation was coming in.   The five of us watched from the window outside and saw four servers clean away our table. Four. Why couldn't one of those four help us? Lord knows symposium can't get a clue.   That all, folks. Their carrot cake can't redeem this one.   C ya never."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place after reading the reviews about their cakes. We came here for dinner on a Sunday night and had to wait about 20 mins even though there were free tables. We sat at the bar to wait for a table and the bartender was nice enough to offer us some drinks while we waited. Once we were seated, our server was prompt to order. We ordered a chicken parmesean sandwich and a cheeseburger. The sandwich was mediocre, nothing too special about it but the cheeseburger tasted really bland, almost like frozen patties you buy at the supermarket. Afterwards, we ordered the 2 for 1 cake special. $8.95 got us a hazelnut chocolate cake and a fudge brownie cheesecake which I can say was much better than the entrees we had. I highly recommend this place for dessert and will return for their martini nights!"}
{"text":"Decided to go there last night for supper. We arrived around 5:30 and there was not that many people inside ( but it did start to fill up by the time we left). The restaurant is a nice big space. I decided to have the fish burger and my wife had the jack Daniel's flank steak. The fish burger was good (real fish filet not crispy coated fish) but the tomatoes could have been fresher. The accompanying fries were also well done. My wife enjoyed her steak that was prepared as she wanted but did not find anything super extraordinary about the sauce. However she really loved the accompanying mashed potatoes. On Sunday's they have two for one dessert special but we were not really hungry for dessert (although they did look delicious). Will probably go again to try some of their specials."}
{"text":"This place is just okay for food but the cakes from LA Rocca are amazing.  Their daily special are a good deal and I can recommend this place due to the lack of choices in Ajax"}
{"text":"Went for dinner Friday night. If you go before 5:30pm you really can't beat the prices. The early bird dinners are a great deal, they include dessert, and their drink specials are terrific too. The wait staff needs a lot more training unfortunately. Since this location is relatively new, I suppose that will come with time."}
{"text":"We tried to dine here on good Friday but eventually just left  empty handed.  No fault of the people working this location on that day, they were just under-staffed and perhaps under trained.  We walked in as a party of 6 with 2 seniors and two toddlers. We were seated immediately and then ignored for 15-20 minutes before we eventually packed everyone up and left.  Needless to say the kids were beside themselves at that point. Had the staff been up front about wait times we could have decided what to do without disrupting the place upon leaving."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here a month ago. It was pretty much dead. I ordered a Long Island iced tea and my husband ordered a Heineken to start. The island iced tea was so strong, I asked if they could sweeten it a bit and they asked if I wanted more simple syrup in it. That is not how a Long Island iced tea is made. After that it was so gross from the syrup, I asked for a regular iced tea instead. I ordered a cheddar burger with onion rings and my husband ordered wings. The waiter spilt the small container of mayo on my arm when he was bringing it out, I wasn't mad I knew it wasn't his fault but it still sucked. My burger was pretty okay, the onion rings were hard as rock though, not fresh at all. My husband said some of his wings weren't cooked properly and tasted weird. We opted out of dessert, fearing for the worst. The service was okay but the food was below McDonald's quality. About 20 minutes after we left I became extremely ill, most likely from the burger. Unless they vastly improve their food do not eat here or you will be glued to your toilet all night like I was."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around 1pm and the place was full! (Maybe because it was the end of the year and everyone was on their break?)  7/10 for food. I got the breakfast for champions which came with 3 strips of bacon, 3 eggs, waffle and fries. Bacon was done just right so I was pretty happy with that. Everything else was so average. Great big portion though! We barely finished   3/10 for service. First, no one greeted us until after 5 minutes waiting at the door. Then, we waited 30 minutes for our food and the waitress was always not available when we needed her.   Overall I spent around $15. Pretty decent price for brunch. Will come again because they have a variety of choices for food but don't expect anything spectacular!"}
{"text":"atmosphere! i love it, nicely decorated, dim, and a good place for a chat/lounge.  it's nice to be able to order drinks, food or dessert and not be obligated to buy food but if you do, it's definitely worth it.   went for a monday special, burger night! i think around $3.75. wow i was surprised. not a disappointing burger at all for this price. fries need to be ordered additional though. also, dessert is a pretty good selection as well. MUCH better then nasty demetres. i'm sorry, but this place blows demetres to the dumps.  two thumbs up! definitely worth a try.  refund guaranteed if you're not satisfied! okie, well, that's something you should work out with the big boss there.  but in all seriousness, drop by for some midnight dessert, b/c they do have pretty decent hours and decent food, plus it's a franchise! i'm sure you'll find one in your area.  atmosphere: 5/5 (dimly lit, busy, couches) food: 3.5/5 (love that it's got a lot of variety - great desserts, drinks-coffee, bar drinks etc) price: 4/5 parking: 5/5 comfort: 5/5 (nice couches there) wait time: not really (packed, yes @90% full - i just hate going to dead cafes sometimes. and this was a MONDAY night. place pretty decent size)  weekly specials: monday: Burger and Draft Night 3.75 each tuesday: Pasta Nights 9.95 wed: Martini and Mussels 4$, 9.95$ thurs: Date Night $40 for two sun: Two 4 One Cake Slices"}
{"text":"Went here one night for some dinner with two others. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated on the patio while three staff members stood in front of us talking. We were waiting for a table to be cleaned. After being sat our server came by 5 mins later and offered us drinks. We ordered appetizers to share and a burger as well. The portions were very small, and the food took so long to come out. Overall, my first experience was not great. I don't know if I will be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. I was there for about over 3 hours, because our server took so long to come to our table and ask if we wanted anything else. To the point when we were eating dinner we where rushed to finish and given the bill right away, they didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything. They told us they were kicking us out from our table because it was reserved and would move us to a booth for dessert, and we were told to bring our drinks to the new table. After asking for our waiter 2 times (keep in mind the server never asked if we wanted to refill our drinks or anything during this whole time), the server came back and asked what else we wanted and we said we would like dessert. After over 50 minutes we received it. Honestly, I have been here before and have never experienced this. Service is not the greatest at this location."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with the family. The traditional breakfast items are pretty pricy. We all ended up having variations of the pulled pork sandwich and we were all pleased. Not my first choice of the type of bread, but alas! Haven't been back but they seem to have great weekday specials on various entrees so I might venture back."}
{"text":"They give you the bill with 15% tip already included in it. Soup was too salty. The wraps were not good. Pad Thai was ok. Way too expensive for the quality of food they have."}
{"text":"We were part of a large group, so we had a prearranged menu to choose from. I had ordered the Greek chicken with salad. The chicken was a little dry but flavorful.  Unfortunately a few people ordered the steak choice and their meat was  tuff.  The appetizer platters we had ordered for the table was sparse.  The calamari was very small but tasted good. The grilled vegetable flatbread  was delicious. As this was Sunday they had a few specials like half price on wine. Select appetizers were specially priced, and desert was buy one get one free.. Good options if you are trying to save money.  Staff were very nice and helpful. I have been to other Symposium locations and I have enjoyed the food.  My favorite is their carrot cake. Sooo yummy!  We past on desert as we had a special occasion cake.  My real only negative is that the restaurant is very noisy.  The music is too loud.  You add that to the din from other tables and it makes for difficult conversation........  If I could make a suggestion to take down the background music a few decibels.  All in all we had a very nice family occasion."}
{"text":"Symposium recently opened in Oakridges.  Great addition to the town. We went for coffee and desert. The carrot cake was delicious.unfortunately I couldn't finish the portion was huge. Great menu , lots to choose from. They serve breakfast every day. Each day they offer a different special.  Guess where I'll be on Wednesday ......Martini Night at Symposium! Staff are friendly, very nice ambience, summer patio and lots of parking."}
{"text":"We have been here since it has opened, unfortunately the service and the quality of food diminished with each visit.   They can't seem to get proteins cooked to your liking (overcooked and dry normally), had poached eggs come out like hard boiled eggs instead. Not very well seasoned either.   Feel bad for the waiters and waitresses for taking the grunt of the bad food produced. Never started out like this but thats what it is now. Advice, go somewhere else till the cooks and management has changed."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did.   I went with a group of 13 and we were quickly seated on a busy night.   My friends had the deserts while I had a main since I was starving.  I had the Pesto Salmon which was unimpressive. I barely tasted the pesto and the salmon left a lot to be desired. I was also disappointed as the menu indicated rice as a side and I got fries instead. I would have mentioned something to our waiter but hew was almost non-existent to our table so I just sat there and ate it despite it not being what I ordered.  I also had their cafe mocha which wasn't something that was great. It was average at best.  I will say that the decor and mood that is set in this place is great and its one of the few reasons as to why I really wanted to like this place.  Here's the kicker though. It was mainly 2 things that ruined this place for me. The bathrooms were small and lacking the facilities to support the amount of people in the restaurant. The floor was slippery when I used the washroom and felt like there was a thin film of oil on the ground.  But the worst part of what happened that night was that my friends ordered a pitcher for mojitos and they found a live earwig in their pitcher. Naturally the staff replaced the pitcher and didn't charge us at all for it. But that should never happen....ever.  Their deals look great and I've heard their breakfasts are pretty good. I'm just not sold on it from my experience."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Weekday. Food is ok. Staff tried to rush us even though it was not a busy day."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant over the years since it opened a few times... I still don't think it's good. Someone else always makes the decision to eat here... I've never suggested this place. Mind you I've never been here for breakfast so that might be a different story.  Regardless of what the food tastes like (mediocre in my opinion), the service just isn't good. It seems they are just too understaffed at times... I felt bad for the lady serving our table (party of 15 or so), plus it seemed she was also looking  after the rest of the tables in our half of the restaurant. It was slow.   Don't have the sangria... more than one person at our table sent theirs back. People make a big deal about the cakes and honestly I don't think they're special. If I had to eat here again I could manage, but wouldn't be thrilled."}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom Swiss burger and fries for take-out. The staff were friendly and personable. The food was not overly greasy although for $17 I would have expected a larger portion of fries than that which was given. The burger itself was rife with taste and juicy. The toppings for the burger were generous. I think though, upon reflection, the price to amount value was skewed.  I didn't stick around but the ambience seemed very nice."}
{"text":"We went to the Symposium Cafe restaurant for Sunday dinner. Symposium Cafe is a nicely decorated restaurant. The waiter was great and very friendly.  The one star review is for the food. The food was terrible. We ordered the cajun shrimp for appetizer. I ordered the pork terderloin and my friend ordered the chicken parmesan. The shrimp was battered and overcooked like little brown rocks. The pork terderloin was overcooked and dry. I could have cooked a better pork tenderloin. My friend was not impressed with her chicken parmesan. It was also dry and overcooked.  Would we go back? I doubt it. It seems like this restaurant is better for cakes and deserts."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this new restaurant. Excellent service, very good tasty food, and not out of this world pricing.  It's so clean inside. The decor is beautiful and so welcoming. It's definitely my new spot."}
{"text":"Got wide variety of food and liqour. Their daily specials is very cheap in price and rich in quality. while visit this please more often."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Our waiter was very nice and kept checking up on us but for the food. My boyfriend got wings and he said they were just regular wings nothing special and I had gotten the salmon salad which was not that great, no dressing on it and when I had asked for some more in the side he literally gave me oil in a cup. Did not enjoy it for the money spent."}
{"text":"Ordered from the date night menu... not very impressed.. the chicken was very dry had a gross olive paste smothered on it.. the rice was littered with salt and the plate was soaked in soya sauce.. It's enough to make me not want to return.   Waitress was very nice, but lack of quality in the kitchen most definitely!"}
{"text":"The staff here are super nice. & the food is pretty affordable. Their patio is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and there are a little problems here and there but I'm sure they can fix it  I had the 3 eggs and so did my mom. We asked for the wrong type of egg and they substituted with 3 NEW eggs.  Took around 20 minutes for our food to come :( and there weren't many people in the restaurant :o  Their breakfast potatoes are some of the BEST I've ever had in markham. Consider comming here.  Service was meh :p"}
{"text":"Good Stuff!  We really enjoyed this place.  We went on discounted martini day. So, any time I can get the wife tipsy on the cheap, you know it's going to be a good night.  The kids all did well with their food and overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"To me, Symposium is a nice addition to the neighbourhood, but the food is neither here nor there.   The interior is impressive, the fresh juice bar is great - i'm not a regular of the chain, but they really need to look at adding some healthy options to their menu. The menu is really a bit dated. But this place has some great potential because there isn't much rivalling it in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"tldr; A bountiful breakfast menu with large portions and reasonable prices. Definitely worth it to check out if you're nearby and have a not-so-quiet party in tow.  It's all about expectations and I didn't really have very high ones going in. They serve classic American breakfasts and that's exactly what you get. The food isn't funky or fun in anyway but it's filling and the restaurant environment is very casual. I went with a group of friends and we definitely overstayed our welcome by sitting and drinking water for an hour after we finished eating but the staff was sweet enough and only gave us the nudge when there was a line forming for seats.    What I got:  French toast with chocolate chips (3/5): A decent dish of egg soaked bread with melted chocolate chips on top, a side of ham and a side of fruit. One of the gripes I had with this was that they didn't serve it with maple syrup, instead they had table syrup. Maybe I'm a bit of a spoiled french toast brat but come on the real stuff tastes eons better. I also tasted too much egg in the toast; it just didn't blend well together and the chocolate was only helping to cover it up. Overall it wasn't bad, but nothing exceptional.  I would probably give the food a higher rating if I had had one of their cakes which I've hear is amazing. I do recommend it for it's excellent hours and solid staff but if you're looking for mind blowing food then head elsewhere. All that's here is generic."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I have never heard of Symposium Cafe. Apparently, they are all over Ontario, and with many more stores opening soon in the GTA! They also have fantastic daily specials posted on their website - '7 reasons to keep coming back' - awesome deals!  Located in a small plaza on the SW corner of Kennedy and Major Mackenzie, this lovely cafe has a cozy, causal and friendly atmosphere. You can definitely smell the sweet aroma of crepes and waffles right when you walk in :D Super packed on this Friday night, be sure to make a reservation!   Overall, food was quite good. We ordered a few items to share :) I really enjoyed the pulled pork flat bread - it was very delicious - made with a thin crispy dough topped with lots of pulled pork and cheeses *must order flat breads*!! The marinara mussels had a very tasty broth; I shall come back on Wednesday for their mussels special ;) Salmon with pesto sauce on rice was nicely presented, and the sauce went well with the salmon (I'm not a big fan of salmon, but I will give this a pass!) And lastly, we ended our meal with waffles topped with fresh fruits and vanilla ice cream :D #spoiled  Okay, on to service. I liked that fact that the manager always addressed me by my name and made sure my party of 9 was doing alright from time to time that evening. However, I was not too pleased with a couple things that had happened during dinner service - minus the minor issues of slow service and that my salmon order was missed (I understand that it is still a relatively new establishment, so I'm not too picky about that.)  1) Chairs were missing from our reserved table. A couple of my friends had to awkwardly stand and wait for chairs to become available while others were seated. Offer temporary folding chairs or stools perhaps? 2) Ordered a bottle of rosé wine, but waiter decided to give me a dry red wine instead because they ran out of rosé and said that it is similar to a rosé. Uh, no. Please don't make that decision for me. I would rather pick something else; I dislike red.  I will still come back and give this place another try... they have such a large menu from breakfast, lunch to dinner and late night desserts. I'm sure service will improve over time and with more training. Keep up the good work, Symposium!"}
{"text":"Food was great- not much difference to the location on highway 7. Free wifi, great specials, what was my biggest problem?  SLOW SERVICE. This is a Saturday evening, but I am one of only FOUR groups in the entire restaurant.   My friend and I ordered a pitcher of Sangria which arrived AFTER we had started eating our food. The waiter really lacked knowledge of the menu and hey you don't have to smile and be happy- I get it you're at work, but at least try to be helpful when asked a question about the menu items.  It was really annoying that, for a 5pm on Saturday they failed to be working hard. There were more servers than groups of people, but they were chatting amongst the bar to themselves which is probably why they forgot to make the sangria. And some were even sitting down. So if there's so many of you.... why couldn't I get my water, food, and drinks faster?  Took 10-15 minutes to bring out the waters after we've been seated.    IF YOU LIVE IN THE AREA, JUST GO TO HIGHWAY 7 SYMPOSIUM."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. First time here,  and the atmosphere is light and comfortable.  Made it in the door before the lunch rush.  8 tables got sat within ten minutes and the server did a great job of trying to manage it by herself -  and she kept a smile on her face.   If she hadn't,  I would have rated this a two star. Food was good.  Price was OK.  Not overly expensive but not cheap by any means.  My wife and I enjoyed the food and the artwork.  Seems like the Manager got caught off guard with too little staff.  He finally got around to at least assisting with topping up water and coffee.   They need runners from the kitchen when food up - my medium steak was well done by the time it got to me.  Still good tho."}
{"text":"Great food! Reasonably priced! And good ambiance. Would highly recommend it as a cute date spot!"}
{"text":"I have driven passed this location many times. I brought my book club to this location to check them out. the menu was nice and very different and would cover many budget.    I had six people in my group i was seted fine (noon on a sunday).  They had no problme for waitting for my group members to arrive 20 miunts later.    we got single bills, it alway a good idea to let them know before you order. (NOTE: if you have more then 10 your get a charge 10% its writen i seen it).      We order our food from lunch to brekfast food  it was about average price. The group felt the food had no flaver even if the food was hot.  The server was very nice and friendly and very acomidtion to the group.    The environment:  Diffrent it made me feel like i was in ROME with all the old painting on the wall.  The chirs when you sit made you lower perhap a booth would be good or the bar (yes they have a bar).  I not sure if i would go back but it was nothing special for me."}
{"text":"Great new spot in my hood with such warm ambiance great for families or friends for dinner, coffee, dessert or all of the above. This location replaced Max Convenience Store and rightfully gained the status of landmark-ing this corner like a BOSS!   At first, Symposium Café gave off the ''coffee and tea'' vibe and then you dine in and their menu is like 50 lbs heavy. Decisions, decisions, you say? I wanted to eat backwards and start my meal with a huge slice of cake and waffles and then finish off with a steak salad.  They've got specials every day which makes Monday burger night, however they remain a ''dine-in special'' ONLY so don't think for once ordering 5 burgers for $20 will earn you bragging rights at the dinner table without breaking a sweat in the kitchen. Bring 'em all in and have a drink instead. Would've been better if it came with a small side of fries though, even like 10 pcs.(minus 1 star) but then again, HELLO YONGE ST. property value!  Our server was very attentive and super sweet, considering the many requests our group had with a party of 4 children in tow. I mean, Monday is tough already and dealing with 'more mayo and more ketchup' and potentially mixing up beer and milk requires a high level of pretending you give a hoot and playing nice nice all at once.  This location, seems to me operates like it's franchise owned which is great. Management seems more involved with the customers. The Manager came out on many occasions dealing with customers himself. He even agreed to serving a free burger for my cousin as his cow mooed a bit too late while everybody else was already indulging and belching. The fact that they owned up to FORGETTING the order AND RECOVERING quickly without wasting anytime on pointing fingers to who had mild amnesia proved this ship is run properly."}
{"text":"I remember the glory days of the symposium, where you couldn't find a spot on a Friday night and it was filled to bursting with teens drinking coffee and eating desserts. These memories are about ten years old though, and needless to say, it's changed.  My friend and I decided to meet here for dinner. When I arrived close to 5 it was nearly empty - three other tables were occupied. By the time we left around 7:30, it had amassed a bit of a crowd. Nearly half full. This is nice in terms of ambience and being able to hear your conversation. The music was amazing - 90s hits. I mean spice girls, Hanson, coolio. It was awesome! A nice level too. I liked being able to hear the music but also easily able to drown it out.  There wasn't a whole lot in terms of gluten free options, but I have to applaud them for knowing what it is and having a ready response. That sometimes makes all the difference.  So there was the basic grilled chicken/baked fish with salad. Or pad Thai! So of course I went for pad Thai. My friend had souvlaki. She also eats gluten free but won't die if she eats gluten so I'm not sure how safe her meal was. So go for the pad Thai, or ask some detailed souvlaki questions. The pad Thai was great! Very flavourful and super spicy! The only part I didn't like was the egg. I would have preferred no egg, or for it to be crumbled much smaller. It pretty much seemed like a piece of an omelette on my pad Thai. I also really enjoyed the carrots, bok choy and red peppers. There were tons of veggies mixed in. I couldn't even finish the meal and that's saying something!  Our server Daniel was great. Very chatty and nice. Not annoying, didn't hover. Checked in just enough, added in some fun humour. In all, he was exactly what you look for in a server.  The menu itself is huge. Tons of options for all of you people who are able to eat gluten. Sigh. The menu is somewhat reminiscent of a pickle barrel. Lots of drink options as well, fun, fruity, martinis, wine, and of course tons of speciality coffee and tea choices. Not a bad place to spend a Friday. Oh and the chairs are super comfortable!"}
{"text":"Whole family finds this a very nice place to dine. Atmosphere, menu variety, and decor are above average. Therefore, the prices are slightly excessive during regular dining hours. Best value is the early bird specials.  Pros are that they use real unprocessed vegetables not corn, broccoli, cauliflower. You'll see carrot sticks cooked, red peppers, baby bok choy, and even asparagus, amongst other selections. Most places serve those rubber mini mutant carrots that don't taste like carrots, among other mixed regular veggies. The meats, sauces are very tasty. Usually busy, and if well staffed, service is as expected. Never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I went here this morning for a breakfast date. I was not greeted correctly, only told to sit wherever you want to and literally slid the menu towards myself and my boyfriend RUDE. She proceeded to leave us and attended the to the table in front and told them good morning and asked how their day was going. Which we didn't get a peep from here.    The food was good though...Very unfortunate because I will never return since the service was so horrid."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Went for breakfast... had the bacon and egg sandwich on chibata bread which was delish! Server was also cool, very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great company helped make for a special brunch!  When you have a large group, It's not often that everyone is blown away by their choice. Our server, Michelle was delightful and made sure that everything was just right.   My wife and I had the Greek salad topped with a really nice piece of salmon.  Salmon was cooked to perfection and salad had just the right amount of tasty dressing.   The omelets looked good as did the French toast.  Excellent value for the money."}
{"text":"I grew up in Woodbridge, home to the first symposium Cafe. Now that my family lives in Newmarket, I was delighted to find a symposium Cafe here!   Recognizing that it's a franchise, the quality of food and service can differ however, it is not the case here. The food was tasty and very well priced. Their home fries are my favourite. Deliciously seasoned and crunchy to the last bite. Our server was prompt and friendly. She asked how was our first bite, came back again to ask if we needed anything else, when we finished, she promptly came over to remove our plates.   My family loves it here and will be returning customers."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today because my friends wanted to. Based on all of the negative reviews here, I wanted to object because I knew it was going to be terrible. I was right - wish I spoke up. I ordered a California chicken sandwich. I was excited about the guac in it, because I love all things avocado. Unfortunately, this was the worst part! I took two bites and gagged. The guac was literally old, brown and bitter. My husband was disgusted and felt bad for me. I didn't want to make a scene, but my friend complained to the server on my behalf. We got an apology, but no compensation. I removed the bottom bun with the guac and ate the rest of the bland sandwich. Oh, I also asked for no bacon in my sandwich, and guess what I got... had to send it back.   Definitely listen to everyone else here who has advised the gross food. I would disagree with others about the service though. I thought the servers were attentive and did the best that they could. Can't blame them for the kitchen and management's lack of attention to freshness.   I WONT be coming back. Next time, I won't be so polite about lunch options."}
{"text":"Went there for the 3rd time this past weekend.  The first thing both my guest and I noticed about the place is that it looked and smelled fresh and SPOTLESS.  When we used the bathroom facilities they were SPOTLESS as well.  Since the last time I was there, they have removed a lot of the silk flowers and silk plants that I deplore in eating establishments.  The wait staff (men and women) were so friendly and attentive and it did not seem \"forced.\"  The food was hot and fresh and tasty.  The carrot cake was DEVINE - 4 layers with cream cheese icing in between each layer.  There was a steady stream of customers - all ages, all kinds!  On the way out, we were personally greeted by the new owner:  a kind and elegant gentlemen.  He took the time to introduce himself and have a chat with us.  What can I say?  I will definitely be back.  This place DESERVES business.  Keep up the good work Symposium in Thornhill.  Thank you very much for all your efforts and keep it up!  (Oh, I requested a table where the background music (speakers) was not as loud and they turned the music down without my even asking.)"}
{"text":"Food is ok plus but unfortunately servers are not well trained. Probably one of the most basic services you would get in Toronto. And I have been here at least 10 times, just because it's close to my residence."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting your location today. I met 2 of my friends and we came in today for brunch.  My friend ordered a fruit bowl and found a black hair in it. We did not say anything because we had finished our meal and decided not to make any scene about it.  While we waited for our waitress to finish eating at the bar after many attempts to call her over, she finally came over. We asked for the bill and for a glass of water.  When she returned with the glass of water she then spilt 1/4 of the glass of water into my Kate spade purse.  No apology laughed it off and never offered to get me a napkin or paper towel to dry it up. I then took my wallet out to pay and it was soaking wet. I am not impressed with her way of handling this situation. I understand that mistakes happen but she could have been a lot more careful first of all and been more understanding to help offer to get me something to clean it up with.  She brushed it off and did not care I will not ever go back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday. The place was not especially busy, but we still had to wait to be seated. There were 3 of us and the server showed us to a 2-person table first, which was obviously too small. Feeling a bit puzzled, she then led us to another take without asking us to follow her. Another server tended to our table who was a lot more polite. The service and food was very slow though. She also took one of the order wrong. When asked she did not even know their own menu and had to ask us to clarify. The food itself was not bad but not really worth the 40 minutes wait. No one came to ask us how we were doing our refill our water and coffee throughout the meal. When getting the bill, the server didn't know how to work the card machine, and TOOK MY CARD AWAY with the machine to ask her coworker. Really don't want to return here again."}
{"text":"The day that my husband proposed last year, we went to this cafe with our friends to celebrate! This cafe has a nice atmosphere! When I got my broccoli cheddar soup, the bowl was big but there was barely any soup for me to eat, I put my spoon midway to the soup and it immediately touched the bottom of the bowl. So my husband went back to get the bowl full all the way to the top . It was good soup and the chef was nice about it!  Another yummy dish is the spinach and artichoke dip. I'll definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Had such a great time there and food was great as always.   The atmosphere was very lounge like and cozy. The decor was antique and brings it back to the 80s lounge/pub style.   I went with my girlfriend twice for our mini catch up date and the waiters and waitresses were super friendly. I ordered the bennie both times and absolutely loved it. I don't quite like the fried potatoes but the rest was tasty and the eggs were made just right- runny!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast today. Symposium really has a great set up and that goes for all the locations. Its always cozy, well decorated and clean inside. It also smelled delicious because of the waffles.  Price wise, you pay an identical price to what you would have payed at eggsmart or anyother breakfast place. Maybe $1-$1.50 more, but not more than than that.   Our server was actually great. He was very well mannered and knew how to talk to people. Most importantly, another person came around and topped up our coffee.   Symposium is a Canadian company and that really makes me happy. For a reasonable price, you get to dine on good food in an above average nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been going there since it opened   This place used to be a Mac Donald's, Kenny Rogers chicken, licks... history lesson   I mainly go on weekends with friend and enjoy their wine. Sunday's they have half off cellar wines  The wines are spot on. I usually order an App which is always delicious   The bartender ---- I don't know his name but he is a fine gentleman and a true example of a pro. He remembers past customers, gives good suggestions on food and wine and is very sociable. Hats off to the bartender whatever ur name is.   The patio in the summer is a nice place to relax and enjoy some wine  Cheers"}
{"text":"Just so people are aware, I contacted their head office twice and still haven't heard back about this pathetic level of service.  I've been to stratengers over a dozen times now and they never cease to be amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here! It has a nice atmosphere and feels like a cafe or lounge. They have the most delicious cripsy chicken wraps and their Asian salad is good as well. Their smoothies are also made from real fruit and tastes fresh. Only complaint here is that they serve their chicken tenders as an appetizer, so it does not come with a side. Their service is quite decent as well."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here with hubby on Saturday. I ordered the Fish Sandwich & hubby had the chicken tenders to start & then the thai wrap with greek salad as a main. My sandwich was delicious & I tasted the chicken tenders which were good too. Our server was a guy (can't remember his name) & he was great. He brought my sandwich with pickles on the side like I asked. I actually hate pickles but hubby loves them so he gets to eat them.  We should have stopped there. Our server went on break & another server a lady took over for him. We ordered the caramel brownie & it was horrible. Dry, and tasted old. I took a couple bites & left it. Hubby didn't want it to go to waste so he ate it all even though he agreed it wasn't good. We complained afterwards to our server (the lady) & she thought we were being sarcastic. I don't blame her, since the plate was empty. I should've stopped hubby from finishing it. Anyway she made a really weird remark & hubby & I looked at each other like: wtf? The server gave us a discount on the dessert & we left bewildered. Later hubby called & talked to the manager to complain. We ended up getting offered a free dessert but I don't think we'll bother next time!  Our first server was great. The second server kinda strange. Despite that we would probably come back for the food. But not the dessert."}
{"text":"I am actually quite surprised of the low score reviews here!  I've visited here twice, both in the afternoon, for breakfast options and regular entrees. The ambiance here is comfortable and relaxing, I especially love the comfy leather chairs in the middle that sink you right in! Talk about feeling at home...   The food quality is amazing here, service is excellent, the servers check in on the table several times during my meal, I loved it.  I've had pea meal bacon at many places and they're always too salty, but this place makes it just right.  My favourite has to be the hot chocolate here, mmmm!  I highly recommend this place for all you Markham people! I actually love this place more than the thornhill location. And they open fairly late"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Had a wrap and then a cookie for dessert. There wasn't anything that made feel like I needed to go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I use to go here all the time. The service is amazing, the drinks are great and usually the food is amazing as well. It use to be our go to spot, but lately the food has been very low quality. It's not worth the $80.00 we usually spend there anymore. The Symposium favourite are good but they changed their menu recently as well. There's nothing really special about this place to me anymore. Maybe in a couple months we'll go check it out again."}
{"text":"Bad, bad service, super slow, the coffees got cold till they brought them, mixed up the orders, the food is ok minus, kids french toast was bread with oil, kids pasta was such a small portion that my 6 year old daughter said its a portion for babies! The only reason i left 2 stars and not 1 is that they had a solid eggs Benedict...  Doubt if i will ever return here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Came at 4pm on the Monday of Civic Holiday. The restaurant was like a ghost town, probably only 2 other tables being served at most. Our server took 15 minutes to come check up on us at the end of the meal. We asked for the bill and it took 10 minutes for her to get the bill because apparently closing down the patio was much more important than actually serving her customers.  We asked to pay by Credit Card and she took another 10 minutes to go fetch the machine since she seemed to have even forgotten we had asked to pay by Credit Card. Even had the audacity to say, \"I cant wait to leave today\" afterwards. No kidding, your quality of service tells ....."}
{"text":"Big portions +1 Free wifi +1 Early bird special +1 had to ask for menu -0.5 Good service +1 Lounge/setting nice +1 Woodbridge prices -1 Washrooms -1  I'm stuffed, I went here expecting the worst because of Shepard station symposium... I was wonderfully surprised(because it newly opened??)  The portions were to big to handle. Kids meal was for a 12 year old. Excellent(mr burns voice)  Server, maybe because she's new she hasn't been down trodden yet in the industry. was polite, friendly attentive and brought refills(ok, I had to ask for the early bird menu) apologetic.  Kiddo didn't like the waffle :-( Kiddo didn't like the decor or the kids drawing sheet Kiddo Didn't like the music Don't bring the kids here(but I already knew that)  They had just opened, the toilet had pooh on it, the washroom was dirty.  If I hadn't seen the washroom it would be a 4-5, it looked nice from far but then closer inspection revealed a truck stop.  /yes I'll repeat leaving kids at home #recommend"}
{"text":"Inside was cozy and inviting   Food- good menu selection. Would come back to try more. Initially ordered the fish & chips (special on a Friday), mussels and calamari. Fish and chips weren't the greatest I had but pretty large portion! Mussels was also a meal in itself and was a huge portion!! Was good, but got a little overwhelming at the end. Didn't finish it. Calamari was average. Nothing outstanding about it. Would definitely come back to try other things on the menu like their desert.  Service- pretty good service. Attentive and clears tables.  Only thing I would complain about is the flys flying around. I know it's hard to tame them but it's kind of a turn off when eating :/ not necessarily their fault, but overall good experience!"}
{"text":"3rd time here in a year for a quick business lunch. JD Flat Iron steak salad was bland with 4 small very small pieces, service much less attentive than previous visits, looked to be understaffed as it was busy.  Won't return for a bit, lots of other choices within 10kms"}
{"text":"The food is not very good. I got this butter chicken rice and it was nothing like curry at all. The chicken was weird too...kinda spongy. Cheddar broccoli soup is very average. Their spinach dip is average. Their calamari almost feels like it's not fried enough.   What I do come to symposium for is their desserts; their waffles are big and affordable and quite delicious. They also have this cookie with melted chocolate inside and topped with ice cream; it's good enough...although the edge of the cookie is quite hard, which makes me think it was a frozen premade cookie that they just threw in the microwave. Ambience is good.  Service is pretty bad. The waiters barely ever come around to check up on how you're doing or refill water, and most of the waiters seem anti-social which isn't the best trait for someone in the service industry to have. Am I expecting too much?  This is just a really (below) AVERAGE restaurant."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times now  I usually get my sweet potato fries - they're perfectly crisp and delicious! I can literally come here and finish the whole serving; on my own. Update: this time I came I was really disappointed with the fries, they weren't filled as they usually are in the plate and the sauce is usually a chipotle - not happy :(   I recently tried the vegetarian pad Thai and I must say it's filled with flavour and the peanuts on top give it that perfect crunch.   In terms of dessert I've hard the Ice cream with fruit on top but I felt like their ice cream wasn't fresh. It tasted like it was in the freezer for quite some time.   The staff are all polite. Out of the three times I've been here I've had one bad experience with a staff member - she never came to check on us and we'd have to flag her down every time we needed her, on a not so busy day"}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Sunday's are buy one get one free slices of cake when you order 2 drinks. The kids meals are $6.49 for an entree, drink, and desssert!  We've tried multiple dishes here. Wife's favorites are the tilapia dishes. I had the salmon, and their brocolli cheddar soup is wicked. And we always go for waffles and ice cream for dessert.  Not sure of the complaints on service. We got served promptly, food came quickly, server constantly checked on us. The quality of the food was what blew us away, and will bring us back.  The servers are extremely friendly to us and our kids, couldn't have had a better experience."}
{"text":"Food was fine but the service was very slow as it was Monday. If it was was the weekend and all tables were full I would understand but 1/4-1/4 of the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for breakfast on the weekends because it is close to us. Its very busy on weekends and sometimes there arent enough staff to accomodate the amount of guests. There is alot of seating, the restaurant is kept clean and has a nice showcase of their cakes for you to see.   They offer specials mon to fri for breakfast and they also have a features each night. I like coming here to sit on the patio or each breastfast inside."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast/brunch. Comfortable seating and good service. The menu is pretty extensive; portion size is decent and prices are fair.   I was so busy taking a picture of everyone else's meal that I forgot to take a picture of mine. I got the Tuscan Benedict and unfortunately, I didn't like the tomato infused Hollandaise sauce. Kind of tasted like bland pasta sauce. Comes with 3 poached eggs and grated gouda to top it off (could have used a bit more smoked gouda though). The breakfast potatoes were great and I really liked my hot chocolate topped with whipped cream.  I've enjoyed some of their other breakfast items too,  like the more generic Eggs Benedict and 3 eggs with farmers sausage. Worth a visit and they have daily specials as well!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. It's a pretty good place to relax for drinks or dessert - never had food here so can't say one way or another. When I went with friends, there was a live band playing jazz music, which was nice. We went later in the evening (maybe around 8 or 9 ish) and we were a large group, but we were able to be seated right away. Good ambiance. Great chai mocha :)"}
{"text":"I gave this 1 star but only because that's the lowest Yelp lets me rate a restaurant.   We got there at 10:30 and ordered the warmed brownie and ice cream, crepe with fruits, and a cake. Our waiter comes back after 30min to tell us what we ordered wasn't available. We thought it was strange that it took them 30 minutes to realize this, meaning they haven't started on our order. Finally, at 11:45, our food arrived.   I had ordered the Mini Warmed Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. My plate came with just the brownie, and 2 dobs of whipped cream. I was already skeptical because there was nothing warmed or heated radiating from my plate but I decided to at least tell the waiter the menu says it comes with vanilla ice cream.   The waiter replies \"does it? I'll check\" (Its written on the menu, this should be easy). He comes back in a bit to confirm that it does and tells me that he will get it for me. While I was waiting for my ice cream, I decided to confirm my suspicions by physically touching the brownie. It was ICE cold. I can get that I didn't touch the brownie as soon as it arrived, but from it arriving to my touching it could not have been more than 10 minutes.   So when the waiter returned with my ice cream, I told him the brownie is supposed to be warm. At this point the waiter is completely confused and tired of fielding my (warranted) demands, and gets his manager. The manager comes and says the brownie has already been heated. I tell him its cold and he replies \" I can only heat it for 30secs bc it will melt away if i do any longer.\" I was confused- brownies shouldn't MELT after heating for 30 seconds, what were they even serving me?! So I asked \"your brownie will melt?\" He confirms and says \"it'll drizzle all over the plate\". I didn't really believe him, so I told him the brownie feels ice cold. He begrudgingly offers \"I can heat it for 1 minute if you want. But it will melt all over the plate. Is that okay?\"   Is this something that a customer should ever have to answer? Obviously it's not okay to serve me your shitty brownie melted. But I gave him the go to heat it up for 1 minute anyway since I figured I'd rather have it warmed than not at all (it was a cold night). He returns with my original plate with the whipped cream on it and another smaller plate of BROKEN APART brownie. He didn't even bother to put some effort into putting the brownie back on the same plate.  Instead, hands me two plates which I had to fit onto the table myself. And of course, he had to have the last word so he noted \"I told you it was going to melt\".   BUT THE BROWNIE WASN'T MELTED. AT ALL. Instead, it was broken apart into perfect cubes. There was nothing melt-y about these heated brownies - like normal brownies, their form stayed intact after being heated.   To finish off a horrendous first experience, after we got our bills and were ready to pay, our waiter took another 45 minutes to come back to our table. Mind you, the restaurant wasn't packed at all...there was at least half the tables empty with 4-5 waiters on hand. How can they be so inattentive on such a slow night??  To sum up, DO NOT COME HERE. SAVE YOUR MONEY, GET WAFFLES AND CAKES ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"Staff is great but my last visit ended up me waiting  for for my food until outer 3 in my part had almost finished there meal. If your having issues in the kitchen TELLL THE CUSTER and bring the food at the same time. This is food service 101."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place when they first opened but found the food mediocre at best and expensive ... Would not recommend it at all ..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for afternoon drinks, espcially the patio. Food quality is 3.5 and service is 4. I'd love to come and try their brunch."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and lunch. Delicious food with good portion sizing with value for your money. Nice quiet atmosphere for coffee date. Also the cakes are so good!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place. Symposium has always been the \"go to\" dessert place ever since they opened up in the GTA. This place is spacious, intimate, and the service here is great. Every time i have been here, the service and food have been great."}
{"text":"Been here a lot of times and loved it each time. This used to be the meet-up place with friends on a fri or sat night. Sometimes when you don't want to go line up outside a club or get all decked out for something else, this is the place to be at. There are great desserts and drinks that you can order. In the summer season you can get a seat outside (if not too busy) and enjoy a delicious dessert on the patio. The crepes, the waffles, and the shakes are delicious. Portions are quite generous so if you're on a date, it's the perfect sharing moment. The decor and ambiance add to the tasty food and drinks. Definitely a great chill place."}
{"text":"Went to the first time in a year. Cake has visible mold when brought to the table. Waiter said it was disgusting"}
{"text":"First visit.  I went  for lunch today with a friend and I ordered the eggs benedict she ordered an omelette with feta, zucchini and tomato. The meals come with home fries and the portions were a good size. I enjoyed the eggs benedict with exception to one thing... the English muffin was burnt on the top. I removed the English muffin and I let the waitress know afterward. My friend enjoyed her omelette. We will give this place another try. Service was great and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Worst brunch experience ever! I went with a big group of my friends on a Saturday morning for having a brunch. The service was awfully slow and careless! It took them more than 20 minutes for just bringing us a regular coffee! I ordered a spinach omelette with mushrooms as add-on and asked to switch my house fries with a fruit bowl. What I received after more than half an hour wait was a regular spinach omelette with no mushrooms, and with house fries instead of fruits bowl! They absolutely neglected my order! Also I asked for 3 freshly squeezed orange juices for my kids and myself and I am 100% sure that the juice was from a concentrated juice box! It tasted so horrible and bitter that my kids even couldn't drink 2 sips! Will Never go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Symposium Cafe on a Thursday night this past week with my boyfriend for a date night after work. We've eaten here several times before, usually during the afternoon. Surprisingly, it was packed. There was a 10 minute wait as well as another couple that came before us waiting for a table. We were quickly seated and our waiter came within a reasonable time for menus and drink orders.   The food took around 15-20 minutes. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and my boyfriend got the NY Jack Daniels steak. I've had this burger before, and my favourite part about it is definitely the sautéed mushrooms and soft tender burger meat. Unfortunately this time the mushrooms were practically raw (legit I kid you not) and the burger was dry. I didn't want to send it back or complain because the waiter seemed stressed out and busy... actually everyone did. And I'm not picky I just really like sautéed mushrooms. :(  I ordered sweet potato fries as well, which were good with the chipotle sauce.    It was probably just a busy night and the kitchen was backed up or something. Overall, I would come back."}
{"text":"I got really excited that Symposium open up right in my neighborhood.  Why?  Now I can get a $3.75 burger with $3.75 beer every Mondays!  $4 Martini on Wednesdays with $9.95 mussels  Date Night $40 for 2 and 1/2 L of Wine for $10  Daily Early Bird Breakfast and Dinner Specials on top of Happy Hour Special.  Opens till 2 am on weekends and 1 am on weekdays when no one else really opens around here.  The dining area is a little smaller the other locations I have been to. Just hope it won't get super busy. If you want to come catch a sport game, there are only 3 tv at the bar area.  $3.75  Caesars from 11~3 pm...  I love Specials!  Btw, the burger was juicy and really good and so was the service!"}
{"text":"Back here for their $4 Martinis on Wednesday!  Love the experience this time as I sat with my friends at the bar and of course we have good services as the bartender made sure we have all the drinks we need tonight and more... I ended up having 4 martinis including one off the menu and my favourite for the night is the Almond Pleasure, just love those dark chocolate chips in the drink!  Calamari ($10.95) is on Late Night Happy Hour Special with 33% off was not bad. Sadly their 50% off Wednesday Special Mussel all sold out by 10:30 pm.. so if you are into mussels.  I can drink 10 of those martini especially those creamy sweet one, they just tastes like liquid dessert..."}
{"text":"$4 Martini on Wednesdays with 32 different ones to choose from!!   Which one? Which one?  I really know where I am going to hang out to wait for anyone on Wednesdays!!  Symposium Cafe!!  Not to mention Unsecured WIFI connections and I got seated right next to the outlets.. I really don't mind that anyone to show up whenever ...take your time.  The tables though are weird it being a little high,, or maybe just me being short?  Espresso Martini - Vanilla Vodka combined with Kahlua and a cold espresso is just delicious!   What should I try next!  Noise level is high but manageable. But that nice smile of dessert : freshly made crepes/waffles are the hardest to resist.  Services though is a little slow..but full house on a Wednesday night!"}
{"text":"The patio does looks promising at this newest Symposium on Sunny afternoon.  I was thinking of having a beer, chill and people watching a little along Yonge Strret.  But they still in the process of getting their liquor licences... so no beers or martini specials till then. **sad face**  I don't really drink their coffees or their foo foo non alcoholic drinks as they are usually really so so.  This location is not as convenient as their other locations if you are driving but perfect if you are using public transit as it is close to North York Station."}
{"text":"omg after 10pm menu is a great deal! 30% off all snacks or appetizers... white wine mussels and sweet n chilly chicken were so good"}
{"text":"Service was decent. Nothing special, just like the food neither good nor bad. Probably better got lunch. Brunch. Not so much for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for an early breakfast, had NO idea they served lunch until I was already full.  Great atmosphere, feels like a traditional cafe and not like a quick-service restaurant. The staff were super friendly, although they rarely checked on us throughout our meal (BIG pet peeve).  I ordered some waffles with a chocolate sauce on top. The waffles were fresh, did not taste like any store-bought frozen food. Plate came with fresh fruit which was a nice addition to my already delicious meal!  Would definitely go again now that I know that they serve lunch.  4 Burps out of 5."}
{"text":"My husbands chocolate martini was blended which was different... also not mentioned in the description.  My wine was a small pour by my standards so I'd stick with a martini here.  I ordered the signature latte for my 2nd. It was as good as it looks. Definitely recommend & suggest passing on the wine & doing this instead.  Place itself has character unique interior and lots of faux textures on the wall & floor. It's like wannabe Italian/Grecian. Can't say I'd return but it was convenient and the one of the nicer options considering the location/neighborhood. The desserts looked great but I can't say as we didn't order any... 2 for one pieces of cake on Sunday"}
{"text":"I went there few times and I personally like the overall vibe of this restaurant. I like the food, customer service and especially dessert.  The only down thing is their coffee and their mussels."}
{"text":"I went there few times for dinner and drinks, i like it but I don't love it.  The servers are amazing, enthusiastic and very kind! The mussels menu needs improvement. The cakes were really dry!  The presentation for the crepes might be amazing, but it is really hard to eat when the icecream is melting and it is served on a flat plate. I would need a spoon or change the dish of the crepes to a bowl. Other than that, their steamers are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice for lunch and it has been really good both times. The last time we were the only customers and the server had no problem seating us outside and checked up on us regularly. The food has consistently been good and the patio is nice despite facing a major road (Major Mackenzie). The interior design is tasteful and the place is open and airy. There is ample free parking in the communal lot. Their prices are decent and portions sizes are just right for me. I haven't been able to check out their washrooms but I'll update my review once I have a chance!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for breakfast since my last review. I still really like the patio, but the quality of food has slipped a bit. Service is still strong.  My last visit, the eggs benny had 1 of the 3 eggs waaaaay over poached. It was pretty well hard boiled. And they were a bit chincey with the potatoes. Aside from that, good stuff."}
{"text":"Inside is gorgeous, a huge open area with a rustic feel. But there are a lot or families and children here. I had gotten cake and it was delicious. Have yet to try the dinner, but I heard the mussels were amazing."}
{"text":"What do you expect people ???   it is just a simple café .  Not a place for a gourmet meals . I think if you lower your expectation then this spacious café  is quite nice .  Great place with lots of parking , conveniently located on Yonge street before Highway 7 and the 407.   Food is quite acceptable considering their price ( reasonable ) .  Staff is trying their best to provide good services .   The setting is good enough to sit down with an old friend to relaxed  ,  or sit around the bar to chill .  My server was Marlee and I give her 5 stars and the café a 4 star !!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to get together with friends or take a date, especially in the evening. They have outdoor seating as well which is great in the summer.   The staff is here is alright; not the most attentive. Food takes a bit long to come out; my date and I ordered a Belgian Waffle with ice cream and it took longer than expected. For these reasons I dropped my score from a 4-star rating to 3-stars.   But the food is what you'd expect, it's good."}
{"text":"Hasn't been updated in years! The chairs are falling apart and worn in.. the restaurant looks sad and dark inside. The staff are not very friendly .. Why are all the photos on here from the business?? Not big portions at all!!  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite and found it absolutely charming. Dean Martin playing on the speakers, lovely decor, spacious and clean. Servers are all very nice, happy to be there, (and easy on the eyes I must admit)  I had the burger and beer special. It's 5 bucks s burger and 5 bucks a beer on Mondays only. The food came out really fast! The 8 oz. burger was grilled to perfection, served hot off the grill with all the fixings. You can order a veggie patty instead of meat too, or get an assortment of cheeses, veggies and sauces on top. I had sautéed mushrooms and roasted red peppers to top it off. Happily ate every last bite. I will definitely be back to try a martini next time."}
{"text":"Walked in with a party of 5.  The manager, whatever his problem was stared at us for a few seconds before muttering \"You can split your party, or you can wait 10 to 15 minutes\".   No emotion, save for a huge frown on his face.   We told him we'll wait.  For over twenty minutes, no one checked or reassured us that we'll be getting a seat soon.  The same manager walked by a few times without uttering a single word.  Is this the service standards now? Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab dessert so decided to try this place. Their mango shake tastes disgusting! It literally tastes like water mixed with something, so I don't recommend getting the mango shake. We also got two appetizers, the calamari and shrimp, it tastes good, however I have tried better. I feel like all three tasted pretty bland.   My favourite part was dessert. The dessert tasted amazing. We got a slice of cake (they have many options), and we got a brownie.   Service was okay, definitely could have been better. Asking for certain things took forever (e.g.  forks, dessert, etc.)   If your going here, stick to the dessert."}
{"text":"My new favourite place for breakfast! I came in at around 2PM after a crazy morning of shopping at Fairview Mall. I got the Egg Benedict, soft poached and it was perfect!  The service was good and prompt!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast and while the food was very good, I found it to be a bit on the pricey side considering what you get. Due in part to it's location and the fact it was a weekend, we had a nominal wait at the door. Certainly not the problem of the restaurant. Our service was not stellar....our server was over quickly enough but the wait time it took to order our food was abnormally long. We waited and waited while our server spent her time telling another employee how she spent the previous evening.  Once our food came out...we never saw our server again and had to chase them down to get our bill. No offer for a coffee refill....no refill on tea.....nada. Considering there are so many other places for breakfast/brunch, I opt to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time at this location , service was abit slow and the food is nothing special . Every thing tastes like it came from the freezer and just warmed up . Nice patio and desserts ."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to come here for desserts but ended up having dinner with friends (and never ended up grabbing desserts because I was so full) and glad I did!  Coming into the restaurant, it smelled so wonderful as the whole place was filled with the scent of waffles and crepes. The menu offered a variety of salads, appetizers, entrees, desserts, drinks and more. We had a tough time choosing what to order because there were so many good options to choose from!  Though they don't take RSVP after 6:30PM, we got a table with no problem for a Friday night. The beauty is that everyday there is some sort of special on the menu. Customer service is exceptional. My waiter Lance was so helpful in many ways and we took some of his meal recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. It was so tasty and affordable. We will definitely come back for the $4 martini night and desserts in particular!"}
{"text":"I went back for symposiums' fish and chip Friday special, 2 pcs for $11.95 (3 for $15.95). I had the two piece haddock with chips, coleslaw and tartar sauce.  The cole slaw and tartar sauce were served in solo single serve plastic cups. The F&C's where beer battered. The batter was thick but not very crispy, slightly soggy. The chips were cooked but not browned. I also forgot about the Malt vinegar and so did my server.  Overall, symposion has many good choices and varieties of food and desserts, the choices are safe and will satisfy most, but, so for nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Always come here for our work breakfast meetings. Place is nice and has a booth area which is perfect for our meetings. The breakfast was good today especially the breakfast potatoes!"}
{"text":"By far the best symposium location I have been to. The manager who greeted my friend and I at the door yesterday at lunch was super friendly. My friend has a 2 month old so we came in with a stroller and the manager made arrangements for us to be seated comfortably which I thought was very nice! My friend also had to do a diaper change and this location even had a change table in the bathroom (bonus!) which you don't see often at many restaurants. Our server was nice too. She attended to us a few times throughout our meal (just enough times that we weren't like umm where's our server? or feel bothered by her check-ins). We grabbed some breakfast and the food was cooked just right! I'm always game for symposium breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast and atmosphere. Dinner menu leaves a bit to be desired. Not amazing and would stick to breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Well here's the positive: It's a relatively quiet place and there's free wi-fi. So, it's good for meeting up with people or hanging out and using the wi-fi.The chairs and booths are comfy too.  After that, it goes downhill. The food was mediocre at best. As for the service, there was a bit of a language issue with the server; I ordered the pork tenderloin and was brought sirloin steak instead. The steak, vegetables and potatoes were all rather plain tasing and boring.  They had a decent selection of alcohol, but they were out of the first two beer options I asked for.   So, I can't recommend this place for the food, just only as a place to hang out."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a casual drink or dinner and mingle with friends. The place looks clean; simple decor but very comfortable; music is not too loud which is is great to chat/mingle with your friends.   This is one of the very few places that open late in Stouffville. Nice place for drinks and dessert late night.  Service was decent; not bad and nothing exceptional.   Overall, this is a great place to hang out with friends. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"For early breakfast during weekend,there is not many options open before 11 am.  I went here at 9am and order a pancake that was crisped to perfection. Loved it."}
{"text":"New place on the block.    Enjoyed coffee and some cake end I enjoyed.  I like the patio space and the ambiance. Parking is easy on the street. Good service. Loved the daily specials.  Looking forward to try breakfast here one day."}
{"text":"Service 3.5/5 Food 2/5  We came in, sat down and got seated by the server. Was asked for drinks etc. The drinks (water) came 10 minutes later.  I got the blackened talapia. The rice tasted like it came out the microwave, the talapia was alright..  We also got a french onion soup. Worst soup ive ever had. Way too salt, bread was packed to the top. The soup soaked into the bread so much it looked like mush after. The cheese was inedible, much like plastic.  The environment was also kind of off. Only couple tables were seated today. Music kept going on and off."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert late at night. Had limited options and service was okay. Food was decent/standard but it is on the pricey side for a late night snack. Not comparable relative to their other locations."}
{"text":"I was here for brunch on a Saturday morning, walked in about 10 AM, and it was not busy at all.  The group of us all ordered different things, with two of us ordering waffles and the other half ordering a more hearty breakfast. We noticed a few things about the food served. The waffles were soggy, not fluffy. Which was quite a disappointment. And when they went to dig into their fruit cups, only the top of the fruit cup served a variety of fruits. Strawberries, banana, cantaloupe. But when you finish the small top layer, the bottom of the cup was all honey dew. If the honey dew was of decent quality, it would not have been a problem. But the honey dew served tasted more like rinds than the actual meat in the melon. They also messed up on a order which my friend substituted her potatoes for her fruit cup. They gave her the potatoes, and we had to ask for the fruit cup after. I ordered a Eggs Benjamin, and I was pleasantly surprised with 3 eggs for my Benjamin. But the simplicity of the plate was not appealing. For other places that I have visited for brunch, the plate was more full, busy, and had other sides other than potatoes.   Overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the brunch that we were served. The servers were very pleasant, but the food could use a improvement."}
{"text":"Below average food. Changed a lot since it's opened. Good deserts and good environment but staff seemed undertrained and busy even thought the place was half full. Wouldn't come back here again after all these years."}
{"text":"Went over to Symposium this morning for breakfast and it truly disappointed me. I've been at this restaurant once before, in North York. The first time was amazing, to me it gave off a very luxury vibe and everything was amazing. After today's visit, I definitely will not be returning.  I ordered Eggs Benedict with Smoked salmon and toast. The toast came out drenched in butter. (I prefer to not eat butter). My potatoes were COLD. When I asked them to pop my plate into the microwave for a minute, they brought me a fresh batch of potatoes that were freshly made. This showcases that they gave me 30 min old potatoes (if not older).  My water was brought out in a dirty glass that had red lipstick on it from a previous visitor.   The person who I was with, ordered a salmon sandwich. They brought out 4 slices of smoked salmon and only 2 slices of bread. Then, when he asked for more bread, he ordered a chibatta bun which came out DRENCHED IN BUTTER!!!   Lastly, there was a new girl with the waiter who was being trained. The girl brought out our drinks and held the cups by the top. The waiter training her was immediately like \"nope nope nope\". Thats very unprofessional on her behalf. She should've told the girl how to put down glasses in the first place instead of having her do it her own way the way she felt right in the moment and then be completely RUDE to her in front of us....   Never again. It is worth paying MUCH MORE MONEY for OUTSTANDING service and food. This cheap stuff I DOn't recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"The location is great. Very close to the highway. The place is clean and service is good. And the food is tasty. If you like margaritas though, don't get one here....We had the chicken and Gouda flatbread as an appetizer, and the fish and chips special, as well as the steak sandwich. All was delicious but we underestimated the amount of food we could eat, so ended up with left overs. The atmosphere here is nice, with nice \"Italian frescos\" on the walls and good lighting. There are specials every day like, Monday you can get a burger (and they're delicious) for $5! And a 20oz draft for $5! (Right?!!). So I'll be back Monday! AND Wednesday: Martinis for $4!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on Sunday, I ordered steak and eggs and cappuccino and  my bf ordered Eggs Benjamin and mocha. His mocha has a burnt taste to it and food was just ok. Asked for medium for my steak and it came out well done. Server never come over to check up on us the entire meal. My bf asked for 2 glasses of water and they never give it to us. I would never come back again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor are great here along with the service.  The price is a bit on the high side for lunch.  The bad part about this place isn't necessarily with the chef, but with the ingredients they have.  I'm not going to go on much on my first experience here, because they compensated for it by giving me a discount.  Just because of that I had decided to give them a second chance.  Second chance has come and gone with their Mussels special for lunch.  Though the food and preparation itself was good, the quality of the mussels themselves are not too good.  They were small and were not too flavorful.  It is kind of sad in that the chef prepared the dish very well already, they were just stuck with bad supplies.  I am giving this a 4-star just because they were accommodating with my diet and allowed me to change the bread with some greens.  Though I am tempted to give this a 3 as well because the food wasn't up to snuff.  If they had a better ingredient supplier this place would've been awesome."}
{"text":"This steakhouse provides decent service and the atmosphere was decent too. The environment was clean but since my family and I went at night, we thought that there would be better lighting but it was a bit too dark so we couldn't see the menu clearly therefore we had to use a flashlight on our phones. I tried the teriyaki chicken rice bowl and I wouldn't say it's the best. There was way too much sauce and so it made the rice a bit soggy. There was also pineapple included in this entree but it didn't really match with the overall flavour. It would taste better if there was less sauce and no pineapple in this meal. I also tried the one of the salmon entrees and it was incredible. It had a good amount of flavour and juice which made the salmon taste even better. The texture of it was really smooth. It also came with a side of vegetables but it was a bit hard to bite into. Some prices were a bit too expensive such as the New York steak and it wasn't quite worth the price. It barely had flavour and it wasn't filling at all. Although this restaurant needs some adjustments, it is a pretty decent restaurant to eat at if you are seeking to eat at a nearby bar and lounge."}
{"text":"This place is only good for Coffee and dessert at best. Food is mediocre and over priced. They use to have BOGO on Sunday's, not sure if that's still around. Nothing special really, not really close to anything but farm land. I live fairly close and pass by almost daily, Avoiding it.   You're better off hitting up main for dinner and an ice cream."}
{"text":"Ordered calamari and fettuccine Alfredo. Calamari was not crispy. Calamari had no bite to it. It didn't come with any dipping sauce. Alfredo was incredibly dry. Sauce was pasty, there was barely any sauce. No flavor at all. Frozen Alfredo tastes even better."}
{"text":"Last night my lady and I stopped in to get $4 burgers. I got a burger with smoked Gouda, bacon and mushrooms. My girl got a burger with cheddar and mushrooms. We also had an order of sweet fries. The burgers were decent, they were cooked good and were still juicy. It's cool to find a spot in Canada that serves pbr beer.   Overall we spent about $50 bucks on $4 burger night but we ordered a lot of stuff and we felt like we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"My friend chose this place for our hangout spot so this was my first visit.   It was pretty empty when I got there around 6:30 but got more busy about an hour in. The server we had was great and that was about it that was great. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and the tilapia entree. I don't think they added any alcohol in mine because I didn't even taste a hint of it. The tilapia was wayy overpriced for a tiny piece of fish ($18). It was bland so I had to add some salt and pepper for some taste.   I definitely don't want to go here again for dinner because $30 for a bland meal and an alcoholic drink with alcohol is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Food and environment are nice, although the staff aren't too friendly or helpful. A good place to come for dessert."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quiet and calm, good place to bring a date. The service was great and the waiter was very helpful. He suggested an appetizer platter that had both the calamari and flatbread for a fraction of the normal price. He came periodically to checkup on the table and to clear unwanted dishes.  The calamari was crispy and had enough spice on its own, no need for the cocktail sauce that came with it. For a place with such classy decor, it was weird that the sauces came in little plastic containers. The flatbread was loaded with sauce and a generous amount a shrimp, it was very similar to a pizza in flavour, except the dough was lighter. The barbecue sauce was a amazing but it drowned out the taste of the Brie. The patty was moist but couldn't really taste anything under than the BBQ sauce and the raw red onions.  The cake selection was huge and the wait staff patiently introduced each cake in the display fridge. There's an added touch of design using chocolate drizzles before it is served. Overall, will come back again for a meal or even just to grab something sweet."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here. I've met for coffee here. I had lunch/dinner here. It's a nice place to hang out. This place was a McD years ago, then a Kenny Roger's Chicken Place, then a Lick's burger place (the order of appearance might be wrong) and now a pretty nice cafe. The food is OK here. I find the temperature and seasoning off for me but you really can't go wrong if you need a nice place in Thornhill to meet some people. There are a few Symposiums around the GTA and they look like they are doing well. I like going there for breakfast - they are well priced and as long as you get the eggs over easy (which is the best overall since I don't like my eggs burnt) you will have a decent meal."}
{"text":"nothing good about this place,  really hard place to get to driving wise  no really big sign to let you know where it is if you blink you miss it the railings are broken and miss shaped there was something red floating in my water... never again!"}
{"text":"I honestly used to love going here as it was a favourite spot among my friends and I during high school. I think the management might have changed because it really has gone downhill since then which was 5 years ago.  Our waiter was absolutely wonderful though. Very friendly and accommodating with my friend's 3 year old kid. One full star for this guy.  I got the eggs neptune which is like eggs benedict but with crab instead of pea meal bacon and asparagus. I don't know how this happened but I tasted a bit of crab shell in my food. Did not enjoy that at all. It came with a decent amount of homestyle fries so that's alright I guess.  I also got a vanilla chai latte. SO good. Probably because of the sugar but this is the one thing that has remained consistent on my many visits here."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening...they have a beautiful patio that is perfect for lounging.  We only had some drinks, but service was friendly, environment was nice. I like it. I will be back to try some evening food.   Again, the décor inside is quite breathtaking.. I'm sort of stunned every time I walk in."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time as I heard their deserts were great! And that it certainly was. We just got the waffle ice cream and while simple definitely satisfied our craving. Waffle was perfectly made and complimented nicely with two simple scoops of vanilla ice cream. We also ordered chicken wings and calamari to start but there wasn't anything special about it. Your typical bar food feels so I probably wouldn't come back to eat food food but a great spot for that late night sweet craving! They also had great cake options. Overall service was great and prices fair."}
