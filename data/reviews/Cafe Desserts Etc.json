{"text":"Five stars for the cakepop and 3 for the breakfast.  They should focus more on the desserts and have less but more interesting breakfast items to differentiate themselves.  We tried this for a weekday breakfast at 10 am. We were quickly seated and served. They were not really sure about an item on the menu if it was available but in the end it worked out. I ordered an omelette and my friend some cereal yogurt combination. Food was ok, nothing extraordinary.   We decided to try one of the cakepops and it was really good. Excellent. Their croissants also looked amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted to order a birthday cake so I walked by and unfortunately stumbled upon this bakery. My boyfriend loves cheesecakes so I ordered a cheesecake and the small 6\" cheesecake is 24$. I picked it up the next day and it was a very very thin cake (They told me that it would give 6 pieces, but it was enough for 2 people) basically each piece will cost you 12 dollars. The writing has been done poorly on a fondant and it dripped by the time I got home. The crust was very very wet and the whole cake was falling apart. I am so unhappy that I decided to write on yelp for the FIRST time. The fruits were few days old so it was all wrinkly and grosse.  NEVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"Cupcakes are tiny. Frosting wasn't even buttercream; it tasted very cheap. Only good thing I can say about them was that the cupcake was moist."}
{"text":"Back in college I spent a semester living in Paris, and I had the chance to taste a lot of French patisserie. Let me tell you then that Desserts ETC is every bit as good as what I was getting over there, and in some cases better.  The staff are extremely friendly and polite, and always accommodating. There have been several times when I've come in looking for a baguette to find them sold out, and the staff have happily baked more for me. This kind of service is so rare and so valuable. Not to mention- their baguettes are just incredible and even more so when they're warm from the oven!  My personal favorite would have to be their selection of cakes sold by the slice (or whole). Slices run $3-4, and they are so perfectly moist and delicate, they defy all reason. When you consider that there is a Second Cup coffee place charging twice as much money for a slice of sub-par cake just up the street, you really appreciate the value you get from this family-run business.  Delicious food, reasonable prices, amazing customer service. Come experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is run by a family, the atmosphere is both bright and colorful. The food is fresh, decent variety for the price. The staff are very personable."}
{"text":"We went here for a wedding cake tasting. I found the place at \" Marions nous \". The cream cheese of the red velvet cupcake is to die for ! really really really good ! We also liked the coconut cupcake, not the frosting, but the sponge. Everyone there is very helpful and super nice !!"}
{"text":"Desserts ETC is easy to miss. At first glance, the establishment doesn't exhibit any particularities over its competitors. That's where our parents' proverb \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" comes into play. The inside of the establishment is clean, well-lit, spacious and welcoming. Cleanness and efficiency have obviously been the priority when setting up the seating spaces.  I'd like to congratulate this establishment for having such excellent, friendly and efficient service. I've never waited more than 2 minutes for my order. I've never had such friendly conversations with cashiers either. This is the first time in my life that the friendliness and warmth of baristas is sufficient enough to make me want to go back to a coffee shop. Laughs and smiles, joyful attitude, etc.   By now, I'm sure everyone's thinking: \"Alright we get it, you want to marry the cashiers. But what about the food man? Get to it.\" Well, the thing is, I despise coffee. This is one of the very few establishments where I'll drink coffee. The cupcakes are heaven and the cakes are mouthwateringly good. Seriously my dear readers, forget Starbucks, Cafe Depot, Second Cup, etc. This place is amazing. They even have specials such as 1 cup of coffee and 1 chocolatine for 3$. 3$ guys. That's insane... 2.50$ if you want a croissants instead of the chocolatine. [Insert spam of heart emojis]  In my white girl friends' words: \"I can't even... like O-M-G, I JUST CAN'T EVEN. I can't. Oooooh my god.\"  I'm a University student that was born in a ghetto of Eastern Europe. That means I'll keep searching for the best bang-for-my-buck until I give out my last breath. This here, is an amazing place. They don't have the variety other coffee shops do but they excel at what they do.  P.S. This review is to describes Desserts ETC and not \"Don Taco\", a Mexican food establishment with whom they physically share the space. I have a separate review for them.  P.P.S. There is WiFi. You need to ask for the password though."}
{"text":"Super clean and excellent food/pastries!! Would highly recommend and come back here in a sec! Service is also top notch!"}
{"text":"Above and beyond thankful.. when everywhere else failed me this place and specially Inpan who went out of his way to make things happen came to my rescue.  You have a very happy costumer from Los angels who will come by when I visit next! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Desserts etc. just opened and it is already doing a brisk business. From cupcakes to elaborate wedding cakes this elegant shop has a lot to appease your sweet tooth. They have also started a weekend brunch that is a definite must try."}
{"text":"L'endroit idéal pour prendre un dessert. Une dizaine de tables entourent un comptoir où on peut admirer des gâteaux de toute les sortes.   Le café \"expresso\" est fait avec une machine automatisée. On est loin d'un café authentique où la tenancière fait mousser du vrai lait.   Quand j'y suis allé, la personne à la caisse était incapable de me servir en français."}
{"text":"This place is Great...Cupcakes are always fresh...I keep trying different ones but Red Velvet and Carrot are my favorite... Macha is also very good...it is kinda small and easy to miss but you'll be glad once you find it... if you have a sweet tooth, this place will definitely become one of your guilty pleasures. Haven't bought a full cake yet but I plan to soon enough."}
{"text":"Those almond croissants looked better then they tasted. I was reassured they were fresh and good. If that's true then I'll just assume that these almond croissants don't have much flavor and crumble like a cookie. I don't think they were just made and nothing about it felt moist. The cake pops were a bit better. The mint chocolate were good. I can't say much about the coffee.. it's just coffee."}
{"text":"I walked by this shop almost everyday and finally decided to give it a try.  It was a pleasant surprise, there were so many different cakes including my favourite: red velvet! They can sell the cake by slice, so I got a slice of red velvet. The slice was on the smaller side for around $7, a bit pricy.  The owner was friendly as well.  Overall, it is conveniently located, tasty with lots of options."}
{"text":"Amazing! The great costumer service, friendly people, warm ambiance, and the food is delicious. I really recommend it for small gatherings (cause the place is small). But they have a great variety of desserts there and that makes up for the small space. Recommendation: cakepops. they literally melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"C'est tellement bon et beau! C'est parfait pour une reception, un party, une soiré de fille ou même un rendez-vous galant! La nourriture est bonne, les gens sont super gentils et la deco est magnifique!  It's beautiful and good! It's perfect for a reception, a party, a girl night or even a date! The food is delicious, the people are super nice and the decoration is super modern and cute!"}
{"text":"I love Desserts Etc! The staff is really friendly, the atmosphere is classy but fun and comfortable, and of course the desserts are perfectly executed! The creme brulee is my favorite so far. The mini dessert cups are awesome too, and the cannolis are perfect. A cup of coffee and an almond croissant makes the best breakfast. Their baguettes are always soft and fresh. I haven't tried brunch yet, but it sounds tasty. My only complaint is that I once got a crunchy macaron, but all the other tasty macarons made up for it, so I can't fault them for it.  Quit staring through the window and go try something! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a little unknown, and it's usually pretty quiet, but the front of house staff are so sweet and helpful, plus the food is super tasty. I had a croissant with ricotta and berries at the suggestion of the cashier, and wow was it good. I'd have never thought to try it, but I'd definitely have it again. I really hope more people start coming in, because it's totally worth it. I've never ordered a cake here, but last time I was in I saw a really cool one being taken away - maybe for my next birthday?"}
