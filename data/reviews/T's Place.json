{"text":"You have so many options and the food is cooked fresh at the time of ordering. I had a whiting fish SANDWICH(3 pieces of fish), seasoned fries and coleslaw for $6.75. It was magically delicious! I will be returning the weekend to try the shrimp and chicken platter with fried okra."}
{"text":"T's Place is one of the best restaurants. The customer service is always friendly. The food is so delicious and i like the fact that they are consistent each time i go.
