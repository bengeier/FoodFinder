{"text":"We ate there yesterday and all I can say is the food was ok, average no the best Mexican I ever had but good, the real downfall for me was the waitress , bus boy was good and quick with chips and salsa but other than that service sucked!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here quite a bit but it's been a while and I have to say it will be a while if ever that I come back. 

We orders the fajitas for two. At least half of it was onions. There was definitely not enough meat for two people for the $26. 

We also ordered the pitcher of margaritas. And it basically tasted like sweet and sour mix on ice. There was little to no tequila. 

The service was not great either."}
{"text":"Moved from NY four years ago and have eaten at this restaurant more than I can count....it is ALWAYS good!! The food is authentic and consistent. I always ask for the \"special\" salsa that you will not get unless you ask for it. It is very hot but probably the best salsa that I have tasted. My kids also really enjoy this place and I would consider it a nice family place to take them. Also, Sunday the kids eat for free!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Zapatas, the first time i went the food and the service were excellent. So i decided to take my husband so he can try it, he had heard bad reviews but i assured him it was very good. 
We arrived and the hostess is very busy texting,once I greet her than she puts her phone down and takes us to a table. We waiting 10 min before the server came to greet us,  she took our drink order and went missing for another 10-15min. We got our drinks, my husband didnt like it so he asked her to take her back and bring water instead, she neever came back with the water, the food arrived, it was good but not great as the first visit. Then our server went MIA again. Definitely service was really bad I will not go back based on the service i received today, they treated us as if we were invisible."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Been here literally over 200 times in the past 10 years.  Never had a bad meal...service is usually real good.  Don't miss the Street Tacos, Chili Rellano Burrito, Mazatlan Shrimp Chimichanga, or the Steak a la Tampique√±a."}
{"text":"Pretty good, ambience good and surprising from the front. Had a coupon so tried it and I'd go again. I'm from So Cal so I'm picky about Mexican food. Salsa was good, burrito pretty good, not great but decent. Service decent too, pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Service is great!  Food is amazing!  Lunch specials are very inexpensive and delicious!  Our favorite is the mango club quesadilla...so yummy!  Atmosphere and attentiveness is top notch!  It's our go to restaurant and we would highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite places when I first moved to Charlotte. My experience has been going down hill the past couple years and sadly last night was my last time. When I walked in the place it smelled like dirty mop water. The seats were sticky from split drinks. We ordered a pitcher of Margarita and it was like mix and ice only. Later that night they were having some club event and before we got dinner came by to collect $15 from everyone at the table. Complete BS since nobody even had their meals yet. No body told us there was a cover before and if there is tell people before your seated. Since we refused to pay our service got worse and even though we should have walked out my friend and I went to hunt for our check and the manager had the nerve to ask our dates to pay the cover again. We paid our bill and left that S. Hole for the last time."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican we have ever had. There was so much lime in the guacamole it was not edible. The burrito was raw and soggy. The quesadilla had next to no cheese. When we mentioned these things to the manager he started to argue with us. Save yourself and do not waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"First impressions were quite positive.  Loved the ambiance inside.  Mexican music, decor, lighting etc...were all very pleasant.  The freshly warm corn chips and salsa (very fresh cilantro) were destroyed by the Mrs. and me within a few minutes and they promptly brought out another fresh batch.  Service was polite and very accommodating with some minor special requests for our entree order.  All was right with our little faux Mexican world.  

Then the entree came.  Tempura Fish Taco, Chicken Burrito and a Beef Chimichanga.  Nothing really wrong with any of them, just not that good.  Quite underwhelmed after the positive beginning to the dining experience.  The shredded chicken in the burrito was too soggy inside and the fish taco was just lacking in sauce and overall zip that great fish tacos bring.  Again, nothing really wrong, just all a little boring and run of the mill.  

FYI: My wife ordered the tempura fish tacos as well and requested they grill non breaded fish (she's Gluten Free).  They were happy to accommodate but after dinner she got a pretty bad gluten reaction so there was still gluten in the tacos somewhere...such is the plight of a GF person trying to dine out :("}
{"text":"Come hungry. My favorite dish is the Carnitas Deluxe Burrito. It puts all of the chain and fastfood burrito places in their place! The restaurant is clean, and although service can be a bit on the slow side at lunch, it is well worth it!  I go here on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Salsa was ok.  Chips were good.  Agree w/ another reviewer that said the place smelled like old, stale, bleachy, mop water which made me question how clean it was.  Carpet was dirty.  Food was just average.  I was craving Mexican food and this place just didn't deliver.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite mexican restaurant.  The fajitas are fantastic.  Everytime we come in, they know us by name and exactly what we want!"}
{"text":"Was told that our wait would be 10-15 minutes, and after that, they kept saying the same thing and that they would check back to me. After an hour of waiting, we finally got our table. The food was good, however, we were extremely disappointed with our rude waitress and poor service."}
{"text":"Went to Zapatas on a Tuesday night for dinner at 6:30pm.   No wait for a table - they immediately sat us outside (weather was gorgeous).  Service was fairly prompt - the chips kept a rollin' out all night.  The food is as you would expect, meaning good but not out of this world.  I've been here many times and for the first time tried a menu option outside of my normal comfort zone.....Pollo con Mole - chicken breast braised in a sweet spicy peanutbutter based sauce with a hint of cinammon.  Really interesting flavors.  I think I'll add it to the rotation.

Other guests in our party that night had fajitas which looked and smelled delicious.  The margarita pitcher didn't last long, but not because it was small, because they're pretty darn good.

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Terrible service and the food was just as bad. Their menu is hilarious because every other word is misspelled. This was probably the most enjoyable part of our experience. The menu is extensive but the food was just blah. There were also ingredients in my burrito that weren't listed in the description. It was supposed to include mushrooms, onions, and chicken. There were thick slices of carrots and zucchini. Wouldn't have minded if the food was cooked correctly. Chips were stale, cheese dip was lukewarm at best. The server disappeared so long that we almost walked out before ordering but I was starving so we stayed. Then when it was time to go, the server was again no where to be found. Also caught management and servers arguing. I am fluent in spanish, so there was no disguise to what was really going on. Will definitely never go back here again. We would have been better staying home and eating a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average. The food is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant. They have all your standard dishes with your standard sides. It tastes like all the Mexican restaurants I've been to before. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I want a basic enchilada with refried beans and rice, and when I do, I go here. But if I'm craving something a little more creative, I'll keep driving."}
{"text":"Sunday is kids eat free day! Plus their salsa and street tacos are awesome and authentic. If you aren't into authentic then try something else. :)"}
{"text":"Purchased a living social deal and was looking forward to trying out this place. The living social voucher did not include gratuity but the restaurant took it upon themselves to add it without telling our party. Couple sitting at table next to us did not get a gratuity charge (we asked). Was told that some patrons don't tip...but why not be consistent and fair? We were not happy as we were a party of a 2 not 6 or more.

Food was bland, service slow, chips and fajitas cold. Asked why my fajitas did not come out sizzling but was ignored. The underneath of tables need to be cleaned as there smashed chips and trash.

Disappointed and won't return."}
{"text":"Typical mexican restaurant in the US. The Food is ok. They have added some new menu like Bombay Chimichanga.

There service isn't too great."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from California and grew up on good Mexican food.  This is our favorite mexican place in town.  We are big fans of the Street Tacos."}
{"text":"I only gave it one star because I had to. We walked in and no one was at the hostess station, nor was the bar tender there. They seemed surpised to see us. I ordered Pollo Fundido and expected melted Jalapeno cheese on my chicken and received melted American cheese. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We eat at Zapata's every few months.  The food is very good and reasonably priced.  Service is always good, with frequent refills on our drinks.  Complimentary chips and salsa.  Overall, consistently very good."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night around 7pm and there was no wait. Which should have tipped me off that something was wrong. My boyfriend and I had the slowest service we've had in a while. We also ordered the Philly appetizer which was decent at best, but a little chewy. I ordered
Fish tacos which were bland. And the frozen margarita didn't seem to have hardly any tequila. Not worth the $$ at all."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff ,prompt order serving and took care of my kids choices.Food was hot and good quality and taste."}
{"text":"We have been going there with family since a while and it's consistent with its pleasant service and good decor. Being a vegetarian, our options are limited but their rice and beans are cooked without any chicken/beef broth so I usually get the Mexican stir fry or the new bombay chimichanga. The dinner portions are good enough for 2 to share, especially after splurging on the home made salsa and tortilla chips. I recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect from Street Tacos.  They were prepared with grilled chicken strips.  The shells were exceptionally good- not soft, not hard crunchy, amazing texture.  I would order tacos again just for the shells.  Service was delightful.  We went on a Wednesday evening.  Although the food was up quickly, the waitress did not rush us.
Chips were good. Salsa had a nice bite, but wasn't too spicy."}
{"text":"As a native Southern Californian I grew up on Mexican food whether prepared by my Mexican American Family or at any of the multitudes of taquerrias throughout  Southern California. Forget the multitude of restaurants and roadside cartas within the great country of Mexico I have been fortunate enough to come across on my journeys south of the border.
The greatest thing about Zapatas Mexican Cantina \"The Employees\" the food is good for what it is, dumbied down Mexican food for the average Joe. It wasn't too long ago there was no other choice but to put up with the dumby downed mexican restaurants in Charlotte but over the past ten years or so there has been an influx of great authentic Mexican restaurants and Taquerrias springing up all over Charlotte mainly on South Blvd and Central. 
If you are not as adventurous as The Epicurean Cowboy. Than perhaps this is as good as it gets for you. Again not a bad place and made even better by the great staff. Escpecially Olevera our favorite. BTW the special salsa upon request is perhaps the best in Charlotte. As a matter of fact I will go on record and declare it is by far the best I have experienced in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Food overall is decent. Customer service was ok at best. The salsas that come with the chips are absolutely terrible. If you order the right thing, you will love it. It isn't anything special for a sit-in mexican restaurant, but not horrible at all. Very average. 3 stars is very generous just because some dishes are very bad."}
{"text":"The worst food you will eat 
  plus too expensive I ordered chicken fajita to go and after I went home I  Open my food was no  chicken only the onion and  Green paper I will never go back again
If I can I would give them No star"}
{"text":"The food is good but I feel like everytime I come here they have a special once I order it they over charge me then refuse to make it right. I really hate it too because the location is great & the patio is peaceful. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good although service is slow and wait staff satisfying requirement. Nothing really special here."}
{"text":"We thought this place was great! A little hesitant because of the rating but honestly I have a feeling the Ballantyne demographic just doesn't quite get this place (which is sad). It's authentic with a real home-cooked feel, despite the place being so big. 

Chips and salsa right when you sit down, delicious guac, cheap (big) beers - I mean what more can you ask for. We both had the fajitas so I can't speak for anything else on the menu, but they were hot and delicious.  

Service was fantastic and attentive. 

Can't wait to come back. Great spot when you want a cold Pacifico and some comfort Mexican food."}
{"text":"This might be the worst service I have ever had. The waitress forgot about us for a good 35 minutes, the food was not very good, and there's paint missing from the loss. Would not come here again. Save a trip"}
{"text":"Food was pretty bad. Over cooked chicken, and the ingredients did not seem fresh.  The restaurant was  dirty with BUGS crawling all over a wall by the kitchen. I was told that they had recently switched their pest control company. You might not need pest control if your restaurant was clean. I like hole in the wall restaurants, greasy spoon so I am not turned off by a little grit but this places food was bad, and it just felt super dirty  and the Bugs grossed us out. I did not finish my meal. We will not be back."}
{"text":"First of all, I'll confess I've only been here with the children I've babysat... so the chaos that usually accompanies groups of kids may have partially swayed my opinion. On another note, this also gives Zapata's points for being kid-friendly... kids eat free on Sundays!

Chips and queso here are really good. And the decor is nice and colorful and not way too tacky (like a lot of \"cantinas\").

Zapata's does have a vegetarian section of their menu, positive points for that... but only 6 options. I definitely gobbled up most of my \"Champinon\" burrito, but it was a little salty and not as fresh as I'd prefer. 

I'd most likely go here during work again, but not on my own."}
{"text":"Have been here many times when visiting but last night my Enchiladas Suiza was horrible and I was sick all night. The other's meals were fine. The Jalape√±o Dip was not spicy and was not very good."}
{"text":"Heeeyyyyyy. I love this place. 

I think a lot of people in Ballantyne rate it lower because it doesn't have that \"one size fits all\" chain feel, but I thought the food was delicious and authentic. Hubs and I split the fajitas for two and it was HUGE. 

Good food, good drinks, good prices. I'll be back. 

Oh - and it's really big! We came once with a group of like 15 and had no problems."}
{"text":"Just find out they cancel the dancing night on Saturday.  If you are looking for dancing, check it out before you go."}
{"text":"I hope this is not the best Mexican food available in the entire city of Charlotte and if this is what people consider authentic Mexican or even tex-mex - wow! However, the place is still fun and the food is belly-filling. The jalapeno cheese dips were crazy popular with my dinner mates - we ordered one with meat, one plain, and one with spinach. The spinach combo was addictive.

Service was fantastic and attentive and almost loving!"}
{"text":"Good overall Mexican food. This ballantyne restaurant is good for standard Mexican dishes. I like the pork carnita tacos and the street tacos. The guacamole made table side is also delightful. Their margaritas are good, I have tried several. I like the free chips and salsa too. As for service--I think they have some good servers and some okay servers. It depends on how busy they are. Every one has been polite when we dine inside. The patio is nice in warm weather too."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place to anyone. Everything is sweet. Don't even have a homemade hot sauce. The fajitas were almost inedible with lots of sugary sauce on them.  First and last trip here.  Too bad!"}
{"text":"Their prices have increased significantly over the years.  Much too pricy for what it is.  Food quality is good.  Place always seems a little gross."}
{"text":"Ordered from work and the the consensus from my co-workers and myself is AWFUL!  The beef and cheese dip is more that a soup. Can't even scoop it with the chips. The presentation and taste is something like a 5 yr d can do at home. Needless to say we will never order from here again!!"}
{"text":"We went to Zapata's for the first time and it was good.  Laid back atmosphere with good service.  My husband and I shared the fajitas and they were great.   I would say that the salsa served with the chips was not great.  It had good flavor but was soupy.  All in all though, it was a good experience and we'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Great service, food and atmosphere.  Awesome lunch specials, great salsa and chips.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. We were seated right away, it was very late on a Saturday night. The d√©cor was very cute, it had a great feeling of Mexico. The waitress was very nice and she assisted pretty quickly. The salso and queso were okay, they were a little runny, but good flavors. The quesidillas were very good and the arroz con pollo was good as well, my fianc√© loved the ranchero sauce. 

The beer selections were very good!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, we didn't care for the chips and salsa. Not our favorite type of Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been here about 8-10 times and I love it. Great service, very good food, nice atmosphere and fair prices. It is my favorite Mexican place in town, hands down. Surprised by the mediocre reviews on here as everyone I know likes it too. I recommend a pitcher of sangria too. Guacamole is good too."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for many years.  However, I may never come back after today.  As I was going to sit down, my waitress had the nerve to ask me if I was pregnant???? I had to do a double take.  Are you serious?  You should NEVER ask a woman that.  I am a small petite person so I have no clue why she would even ask me this....what if I was a woman who just had a miscarriage or had infertility issues???? I cannot even imagine how it would make them feel.  This definitely needs to be addressed with your staff."}
{"text":"The place inside is spacious, comfortable. Margaritas are good. Chips and salsa when you are in the bar are quite good, the mild salsa is quite hot though...
The food is a little bit bland, i ordered the express burrito... the mexican flavor is a little bit deluded...i could not feel the mexican spices in it. Portions again where acceptable. I definetly will give a second chance"}
{"text":"Before I get started, I'll admit right out of the gate that Zapata's deserves a 2 1/2 star rating.  But since that isn't available I'll round down.  My review has a lot to do with my past experience and how far I believe they've fallen off.

I lived in Ballantyne for about five years, but moved closer to center city about six years ago.  While I lived in south Charlotte, this was one of my favorite places to frequent.  Huge plates, tons of fresh veggies, everything cooked great.

Well, after visiting this past weekend - boy things have really fallen off.  To be completely fair it is relatively on a par with most other Mexican restaurants.  But I don't pay $18 for a plate at any other Mexican place, and if I did I would want it to be better than Zapata's turned out.  I opted for the steak, shrimp and veggies (okay, I admit that isn't a typical meal at a Mexican restaurant).  Steak was waaay overcooked, as were the shrimp.  The veggies were good, just not as many as I had come to expect.  All in all the meal was just \"eh\".

A big point of frustration for my fiance came when she ordered drinks for our group: two girls and two guys.  When the drinks were brought to us, there were two large glasses (given to the guys) and two small glasses(given to girls).  The bar had ran out of clean dishes and - instead of washing a couple of cups - just made two sizes and charged her regular price for all.  In fairness they did make it right, but who wants to have to go complain about something like that.

All in all, Zapata's is not a terrible restaurant, but for the price I can eat a lot better.  I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Living in South Carolina means Mexican food does not come by very often. I think the last time I had food like this was in February, so I've been pretty hard pressed for non-Moe's food.

With that in mind, Zapata's has plenty of non-burrito options, but for the fare of enchiladas, tacos, and a pretty extensive specialities menu, I thought it was kind of expensive. I got the enchiladas de mole, and even though the rice and beans were pretty standard, it was just what I wanted for my fix. I liked the mole sauce and the salsas for the table, but I noticed that our food looked like it had been waiting for a little bit when it came out. One of my friends ordered the Street Tacos, and she contests that they are among the best she's ever had. 

I think the aura of the place and the service is what makes Zapata's stand out from the neighborhood Mexican fixture of long combination menus. The place is huge on the inside, and the high ceilings had good decorations and a lot of conversation buzzing around. My favorite item was a line of rusty horse sculptures bursting out of the wall.

It's definitely worth checking out for a birthday as well: lots of surprises and fun that only an energetic and attentive wait-staff can bring."}
{"text":"While this is not my favorite Mexican restaurant, the food is good and service around lunchtime is a-ok.  They do have some nice choices for lunch specials, which are very reasonably priced.   I am a fan of the Fronterra Burrito which includes rice, black beans, chicken & cheese that is served with a side salad.  Chips & salsa are tasty and plentiful, so remember not to fill up before your entree arrives!"}
{"text":"Went this past Saturday night, waited extremely long for our food, atleast an hour. The waitress did refill our drinks and gave another basket of chips while we waited granted an hour with no explanation is ridiculous. We finally got our food, some was cold so we asked to speak with the manager. We were told he was not working. On a  Saturday night... 5 minutes later he comes in to seat a party near us. Finally we talk to him just to tell him we waited long and our food was cold. We had already paid so we weren't looking for free food like the manager Carlos suggested. He then said we were lying about the cold food because he cooked it himself. And walked away waving bye to us. I have seriously never seen such rude behavior. All we wanted was an apology or acknowledgement and instead he called us liars and walked away. Never going there again. 

Food is ok. 

Go to Boardwalk Billies."}
{"text":"Nor just poor service but also rude.  As you look around you see its empty. The food selection is anything but authentic.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. I am vegan and always find something to order and they are accommodating with my requests. It's even come out correctly with no cheese or sour cream.  Most places screw that up lol. The chips and dip were good, served quickly and were refilled promptly. Good service overall. Everyone enjoyed their food.  I had a Bombay chimichanga and it was vegan without the cheese sauce on top.  Very good. Would recommend the other food that my party had that was not vegan. Everyone really liked it. The margaritias--lime on the rocks--were average. We did get the skinny margaritias which are a great option for lower calorie!  Overall I would definitely recommend and plan to go back, for sure."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch wasn't impressed at all. Looked over the menu which I found really small ordered a burrito on the menu was 7 something, it comes out, nothing major kinda on the small side wasn't to worried about it was lunch anyway. Tasted just fair, too many onions for my taste, I go to pay my bill is like 12 dollars, I got a burrito and a tea, WTF. Ofcourse the girl who waited on me couldn't understand nothing but her native tounge, ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I wont be back"}
{"text":"Best staff in Charlotte, hands down. We've gone here for more years than I can count and watched the same staff re-create multiple new menu's and offerings. Everything I've had here is good. The owner is constantly around checking to make sure things are good, but he wont let you know he owns the place. Check it out."}
{"text":"I love Mexican and a super long time ago (circa 2000) I remember Zapatas (University) being really good. No mas. No bueno. 

The salsas to start were watery and the mild tasted solely of black pepper. That was just weird. The chips were plentiful but very bland. They needed salt in a bad way and I rarely need to add salt to anything. 

We were barely seated less then a minute when the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  Seriously. I had just opened my menu. Also, no specials on Saturday? That was weird. 

I ordered the chimichanga and asked for queso on the side because I like my chimichanga crunchy. When it came out, there was some other red sauce on it. Dang. Defeated the purpose of a crispy shell but at that point I was ready to eat anything besides the chips and bad salsa. 

I really wanted this place to be awesome so it could go in the rotation of \"Places we can walk to for Lunch\".  It deserves 1 1/2 stars but I'll be generous and give them a 2. Save your money and put it towards gas to drive to a decent Mexican place."}
{"text":"This was our first time going, despite having lived right around the corner for a couple years. Was surprised to see how big it was inside. Always thought it was more of a hole in the wall, but it's quite expansive inside. Nice enough decor.

Our server (Chuy) was great, but the bar was slow making our drinks. It wasn't busy, so I was perplexed. I had a beer, practically impossible to screw up, and my partner had the Mojito Mexicano. I hate mojitos, but as a bartender, I knew it was a good drink. Was on the stronger side, too. Which is NEVER a problem!

DO order the guacamole fresca. Our server made it table side, and it was exactly the way I like my guacamole, fresh and creamy. YUM! I'll be back for this reason alone. 

We both ordered the Baja Fish Tacos. They didn't look that delicious, but they were pretty damned tasty. Lots of tilapia inside. Usually I have no problem downing a order of three, but had to pack one up. The beans and rice served with it were yummy as well. Everything was piping hot, which is a pet peeve of mine. Points for that. 

All in all, I'm excited to return and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Discovered this place because of a coupon in the Charlotte City Pass book. Excellent. Beautiful restaurant and everything from the complimentary chips and salsa at the beginning to the end, everything is fantastic."}
{"text":"Waaaaay too expensive for the inattentive service and mediocre food. Would rather go to Cabo's close-by."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in charlotte. I have been coming here for past 2 years now. Awesome food. Great service. Prices are worth the taste. I have tried Mexican food at many other places in charlotte. This beats them all."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved here from California and after having our share of California burritos we were open to trying Zapata's. The food was really good but what impressed us was the service. I've been here twice already and each time the service was great. They are very attentive, we went on cinco de Mayo and as busy as they were we still got excellent service. My husband is hard to impress since he loves Southern California Mexican spots, but he really liked the food at Zapata's, we will be visiting this place more often."}
{"text":"Upon entering Zapata's, I felt like I was walking to a Chi-Chi's, which was a special occasion back home in Va Beach when I was a lil evil monster because of my dad's dislike for indigestion-causing foods and chains.  Brightly painted walls and interior decorations made it feel like an Americanized version of a Mexican villa.  Nice digs, it was kitschy homey.  

Located over by the burger joint in Ballantyne that shan't be named (bleh), I headed here for an after work meal that was going to require cheese dip.  And cheese dip was had ($4.50).  Creamy and very good, served with substantial chips that held up to the dipping, but I was quickly filling up on.  The table salsa was cilantro-heavy with a kick, so I passed on that.  

My entree order was a General Combo, which is a pick 2 combo that I chose a chimichanga and a taco for, both beef.  The combo comes with rice and beans ($11).  The beef was over-seasoned - the first thought was too salty, but it wasn't just salt.  And not over-seasoned meaning spicy - just too much stuff that overwhelmed everything.  I poured what was left of my queso on everything and ate what I could.  The rice was typical mexican joint rice, as was the beans, though the beans had a little more flavor than most places, almost a little smoky - but in general the same rice/bean taste as Azteca, Monterrey, etc. 

The service was exceptional (it says Hector on my receipt).  He was friendly and attentive, my drink never went empty and he checked on me without aggravating.  Overall a good experience, but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Fairly good, however the fajitas for two serving size can be a bit on the small side and has varied from visit to visit. Watch for moneymailer coupons for $5 or $10 dine in visits! They also advertise kids eat free on Sunday's. Don't have kids so can't comment on how it works."}
{"text":"Ouch!  Usually this would be at LEAST a 4-star review from me.  When I worked in Cornelius I used to go to Zapatas a few times a week for what we liked to call \"Mexican Therapy\" lunches.

I was so excited when my (new) boss asked if we wanted to do a late lunch at Zapatas this past week in Ballantyne.

We were seated fast, asked for waters and a chance to look over the menu, given chips and salsa, delivered waters, and were left there for 25 minutes.  One of the women at my table physically got up and got us napkins.  Then about 10-15 minutes later she walked over and asked them to take our order.  It was crazy.  All three of the waiters were sitting in the back (within eye-shot), but just didn't come over to our table.

So we got our food pretty fast and then were brought one check.  We put our cards out-they just sat there.  When one of the guys came over to fill up our waters we asked him to please take the check even though he wasn't our waiter.  Poor thing had no idea what we were asking him to do.  Finally we wrapped everything up and got out of there within 1.5 hours.

I still give this place a 3 stars because I honestly believe that maybe they were just having an off day.  Even my boss, who goes there at least 2 times a week said that this was strange for them.

The food is great--I always get disappointed when Mexican Restaurants don't serve tamales, but it's cheap and usually pretty fast service.

Wish I could've shared better news here!"}
{"text":"Awful service for large party. Food was cold, water cups were not refilled, and we were not tended to for the entire evening. Bad service each time we come. Disappointed, because their food is pretty descent... terrible service though"}
{"text":"We have traveled extensively through Mexico as well as living in southern California.  Zapata's is the most authentic of Charlotte area Mexican restaurants.  Food is good and the atmosphere is a perfect rendition of Mexican restaurants, with party areas, decorations, tables and chairs and even beverage blown glasses.

The wait staff are really good.  They explain what is what and will accurately deliver on exceptions, like adding onions, or with or without sauces and substitutions.  And the kitchen can turn out meals rather quickly.

We have been here with grandchildren and there is a Latino sweetness toward children.  The wait staff will laugh with them and somewhat entertain them in a warm, loving way.  

Portions are great.  If you get a platter you get excellent re-fried beans and rice that you might not be able to finish.  The main course are equally ample.

Drinks come in those before mentioned blown glass and the margaritas in stemmed glasses with cactus stems (simulated in glass, of course).  And the bar is very large with some seating in that area.

Both lunch and dinner are the same.  We have had good repeat visits so upgrade Zapata's to four stars."}
{"text":"Zapata's definitely has an accurate 3 star rating on Yelp.  It is far from authentic Mexican food, but it is inexpensive and ok.  

The \"World's Best Taco's\" had little flavor and the steak was very tough.  Honestly, I would eat a Taco Bell taco over these.  Most of their other dishes, however, are better.  The enchiladas are very good.  The service is always quick and friendly.

Zapata's is not a bad option for an inexpensive meal out but it is far from the best Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"Zapata used to be the kick ass Mexican food joint to hit up. Sitting here it seems that they are under new management or something. Lunch menu is one page from 2 types of tacos, and burritos, to one chimichanga and a salad. I want the old Zapata back.......now!  :)"}
{"text":"Love Zapata's! Their staff is friendly and quick! We also have a fun time when we go and the food is so good!"}
{"text":"This is an institution in Ballantyne. We love to come here for dinner.  We also do take-out from here about once every two weeks.  Here's your warning, four out of every five visits the to go menu is wrong. Either it is a missed item or something altogether not what you ordered. Just check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"This place is huge on the inside and can accommodate a large party. We came with a group of 14 on a random Wednesday night and we were seated quickly. 

The menu is small for a typical Mexican restaurant and let's just say the chips were not the best (low flavor) and they brought two types of salsa and both were spicy. One was so spicy that he literally had no flavor.

Tequila selection is decent (1800 available) but when we ordered shots the glasses were not chilled so we had warm shots of tequila (no bueno)."}
{"text":"Thick stale chips, slow service, rude server, menu was lacking in choices. Taco,burrito,enchiladas.  About 2 maybe 3 choices each. Food its lacking flavor, and appeal.   Maybe dinner is better, but lunch its a bust in my book.
  There we 2 of in our party for lunch, we both had the same dishes, the exception was I had beef and the other guest had chicken.  They ended up getting food poisoning from the chicken.
  This is not a place to come if you are limited on time.
  I will not be coming back to this location for any reason."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets such bad reviews.  I almost didn't come here after reading some but thought how bad can it be.  My husband, son and I arrived on a Sunday afternoon and there were a few couples here with several people sitting outside.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  The waiter took our drink orders and appetizer orders and chips were delivered just as quickly.  There is a lot of unique items on the menu and it took us a little bit to decide.  The appetizers arrived fairly quickly.  We had the guacamole, which was great, and the philly egg rolls which my husband loved.  He said he could order those as a meal.  Shortly afterwards our meals arrived.  My son and I had the Aloha tacos and my husband ordered the street tacos.  Everything was great, no complaints.  I am so glad we decided to try this place and have been back several times with the same results."}
{"text":"They missed up our order again... The chicken was dry and the cheese enchiladas had onions and we asked for no onions... Extremely disappointed again.. 


The order never got corrected.

Stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Worst food ever! I eat mexican all the time and this was the most disappointing meal. 5 of us all had the most basic plain food.  

The margarita had barely any liquor in it. The steak was so bland.  A complete waste of $!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Zapatas for years.  The staff is always friendly and the food is excellent.  My favorite dish is something you might never have had but I highly recommend the Pollo con Mole'.  Their Mole' sauce is sweeter than most others and I end up eating here many time just to get this dish.

The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. The first time we went, the carne asada burritos were amazing!  They are giant and my 12 year old son ate the entire thing. The second time we went my wife tried the tortilla soup. We fished out about a pound of tortilla strips from the soup. The taste was strait out of a can but the chicken chunks were lean. Everything we law we had was underwhelming. 

The worst part of the evening was the service. The young gal service is had zero personality, rarely stopped by to fill our water or drink glasses and the only time she smiled was when the check came. My wife insisted on zero tip but I gave her a little for bringing the food to us. 

The reason I bring this up is that our first encounter there was positive. The server was kind, funny, attentive and I gave her a $50 tip!  The second time will be our last.  The woman manager (I assume she is) was out observing everything and if you can't tell that a server is substandard, then I'll take my business elsewhere.   Makes all the difference. 

I'm a firm believer that customer service makes up for crappy food it makes good food taste bad. 

But if you insist on going, the chili relleno is solid, carne asada burrito was delicious, shredded beef was nasty and stay away from the chicken tortilla soup. I'm no food critic but I travel the continent weekly and eat at every recommended dive and fine dining establishments. I also grew up in Los Angeles so I know what good ethnic food tastes like. 

You won't find it here"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Food came out late. They forgot our appetizer. Had to get another waitress to get the table some water. 
 Food tastes great but service was lacking."}
{"text":"Yum!! Closest food I can find in NC to compare with Californian or south Texas Mexican food !!
Street tacos are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The word that comes to mind to describe Zapata's is \"meh.\" The menu, food, and service were all decent, passable, fine, just meh... nothing dazzling about it. However, that said, everything was as expected and came out nice and quick during lunch time. My plate and card were picked up right away when I set them out and you can't ask for more for more than that during the lunch rush! Over all, a solid, quick, easy Mexican joint by nothing special or inspired."}
{"text":"This place is so good. My boyfriend and I go all of the time. They have delicious margaritas. They'd queso is amazing. I love the interior. It is detailed and authentic. There is a downstairs and outdoor seating. The flautas are perfect. He had a delicious fajita. We will be back! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I got the street taco and the new braised pork taco. Neither were good. The meat was dry. The plate was so hot it must have been sitting under warmers. The rice was plasticy. Tacos were greasy. Service was bare minimum. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Consistently good traditional TX-MX faves!  Guacamole is always perfectly done and the Margaritas are excellent!  Service friendly and timely.  Outdoor patio is particularly nice as it faces the large outdoor Ballantyne fountain."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was great. I get the Emilio's tacos every time and I love them."}
{"text":"Family friendly restaurant, the food was great! I do recommend this place to large parties. Service was exceptional. The young man in the front was quite a catch! @Emilio @Daniel"}
{"text":"Poor service but gratuity already added for 6 without explicitly stating so in the menu. Food is so so. Not recommended at all. On the border is much better."}
{"text":"The food was totally gross! We had a bad experience at the one in University and decided to try again with this one, it was still disgusting. Bathrooms were disgusting too."}
{"text":"Zapatas...where have you been all my life?! I somehow had not tried this place but was pleasantly surprised Saturday when we came in for dinner. The decor reminds me of some restaurants in Mexico and the interior is huge! I love the fun vibes and the bar looks great. We were seated and I ordered the Saturday special margarita which had cranberry juice in it. It was a little sweet for my taste but still tasty. The chips were warm and the salsa was great. I ordered the fajita chimichanga which was smothered in queso and was marvelous. We will definitely be back. Our service was timely and friendly. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER LUNCH PICKUP! THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF! 

I ordered for pickup and the dishes were more expensive than they should be, came with little rice and beans, and had very few pieces of meat. 

They have removed several entrees off their lunch menu and now charge $15 FOR PORTIONS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THEIR OLD LUNCH! 

Complaints to the manager solved nothing.
They will serve you a lunch portion but charge you dinner price and say that is their policy."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed our first visit. The decor, music, service. Our dishes were delicious Fajita Burrito and pork carnitas.
A great gem in Ballantyne. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Rude service. Food was just mediocre. Very greasy, kind of gross. Hubby said his steak tasted good though. I doubt we will be back, not sure what locals find appealing there...."}
{"text":"Recently I was here for a lunch with a my coworker. Usually this place is busy but we were seated right away. We ordered our drinks and I decided to wash my hand before I do a deep dive on those chips :) 

The bathroom was pretty clean which is how it should be right? Specially for a restaurant. Anyways I came back and we had couple of different types of salsa which was perfect. 

The place got packed pretty quickly however our order came fairly quickly which was pretty good on their part. Our food came out good and tasty. Towards the end, manager even came to check on us to make sure we had good experience and I like that. 

Overall I had a good experience and the only reason this place didn't get 5 star was the smiling factor on service. On a side note, they could really use beautiful English speaking Latino host. Everywhere else here they have pretty ladies as host and here I think manager was acting as a host."}
{"text":"I am still learning my way around Ballantyne.  Just discovered some restaurants across the way, I didn't know we had a Mexican restaurant over there!  

SERVICE:  Not so great... My waiter acted like he was paranoid, or on crack. I'd be just about to ask him for something and he'd disappear. He basically zoomed by and didn't ask if I needed anything (when I did).  Also, came behind me, grabbed my glass for a refill like a ghost.  Also, kept the change from a $20- like he just assumed AND he overcharged me $1.05 for my fresh guacamole.
  
ATMOSPHERE:  Very festive, Mexican cantina looking d√©cor.  Large restaurant you could get lost in.   I was flying solo for lunch around 1pm... The place was a ghost town. No one was at the front to greet me so another guest and I had to hunt someone down.    

CLEANLINESS:  I didn't see the bathroom.  That's usually my barometer on how clean the kitchen is. FYI: If the bathroom is dirty, I'm walking out.  The hostess sat me near the kitchen. The restaurant itself was clean, but the floors were really dirty in the kitchen, which was in clear view from my seat.  There was a lemon under a table at the entrance of the kitchen that looked like it had been there since construction, but I give them a pass... just because everything else looked clean. 

FOOD: They have a regular and then a gourmet menu, which looks interesting- pineapple and mango stuff... but I like my traditional favorites and it's hard for me to step out.   

The menu was missing the typical a la carte items you normally see in Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the Burrito Deluxe because I like the regular old beef burrito with red sauce on top like most Mexican restaurants serve, but I also like a little lettuce, guacamole, and tomatoes, so I normally order a side guacamole salad.  I didn't see guacamole salad on the menu, so the burrito deluxe looked like it would be sort of like that.

I was disappointed that the food wasn't what I expected... I don't like beans and rice in my burrito. There was hardly any beef and basically no red sauce.  Boooo!   
The salsa was on the hot side and chunkier than I typically like, but seemed fresh and had a good flavor.  It has chunks of onion and jalapeno. The chips were warm and crispy.  I asked for mild salsa, which looked different from the original salsa they bring.  It was finer and not chunky.  It was luke warm and not the greatest flavor. 

They were advertising Guacamole Fresca, so I ordered that. I asked how much and the waitress across the room said $4.95.  A waitress came by and made it fresh before my food came out.  She mashed up avocado (which still had the sticker on it; not a big deal, but come on now!) into a bowl of premixed, fresh ingredients (onion, tomato, cilantro, and I assume salt).  They charged me $6 for it, BTW.  It was the best part of my meal and enough for 2-4 people, so I had it packed up to go. 

The busboy walked by as I was putting away the leftover guacomole and was kind enough to ask me if I'd like some chips to-go since my server didn't have the courtesy to ask... and he was off smoking crack somewhere.  LOL.  

PRICES: It was a pretty expensive lunch because I ordered the fresh guacamole, but that was the highlight of the lunch.  In general, though, the prices are comparable to any other Mexican restaurant in the area.  

FINAL CONCLUSION: All in all, I'd give it another try.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day.  The food showed signs of better things on the menu."}
{"text":"Little expensive for what it is, but it comes with the location I suppose.

Overall, HUGE positive review for Zapata's. This is one of my favorite spots to go for margaritas and tacos with the coworkers for birthdays and other celebrations. Never had less than stellar service and they're always very prompt. 

The white sauce over burritos is THE. BEST."}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon and the pictures online hooked me into going. It's in a small shopping center area where you can find several other shops and restaurants. There is plenty of parking nearby. The back of the restaurant looks like the front. It's a decent size place with great decor that makes it feel authentic. Sever didn't make any recommendations and spoke very softly despite us asking if she could repeat that and we can't hear you. He tome pitch and volume remained the same. They placed us in an area where larger parties are placed. They have daily specials on the menu. The food was okay. I got the enchiladas suiza. It lacked flavor and spice that I'm use to. The sangria was good I recommend that. The rosarita is  a weak drink so skip it if possible.  At the end of the night people fanned out and our waitress disappeared. My friend asked a gentleman working nearby for a to go bag and you would of thought he spit in his Cheerios. The look on his face was priceless. He appeared so disgusted and needless to say didn't return with a bag. The waitress eventually returned and we got what we needed. The gentleman continued to work his area and didn't look our way. I wouldn't say this is great food or service. Let's keep exploring and see what else charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"I ate here once. Once! Never again. I had a combo meal a long time ago which made me so sick I seriously feared for my life. Thank God my mother was here at the time and is a retired nurse. I was laid out on my bedroom floor. I don't know what happened but I suspect the salsa was rancid to a profound degree."}
{"text":"I bought a livingsocial deal for Zapata and we ordered the fish tacos. The portions of the food were huge. The service was fast but average. The price of the food is steep without the deal. The fish tacos were average because I have tasted better fish tacos. They do give you chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It's so close to where I live and work, it would have been great to find a good Mexican restaurant nearby.  Alas, I was disappointed in the food and the service.  Enough to not go back again."}
{"text":"The food and service has taken a major DIVE here. Orders are not taken correctly & the quality of our favorite dishes has gone way down hill. We recently placed an order for two \"to go\" and one of the orders was missing. My husband waited for at least a half hour for the other meal.  No, he was not offered a complimentary beverage while waiting. Clearly something has gone amiss here, and they have \"cheapened down\" their ingredients big time.
Whtat a disappointment!Stramgely, we were talking the day before to two neighbors who referred to Friday's and \"Zapata's\" night. When we mentioned \"going to Zapata's again Friday\"? she answered \"NO, the food has lost it's quality and the service is lacking. We're finding a new Friday night spot. I told her we'd noticed the food becoming greasy/subpar and hoped it was just a temporary chef, so we went back. I could not eat the meal and drank a Boost instead. My husband  wasn't pleased either. We don't plan to return. . Now if someone could suggest a really good Mexican restaurant in Ballantytne/Pineville, we'd be most appreciative."}
{"text":"As I've stated before in a previous review I used to come here all the time back in the day.  Zapatas has completely gone downhill and has now reached the classification of all the other # 14 Mexican type restaurants.  This is not sustainable in this area.

There wasn't a wait tonight, Saturday which you used to have to wait at least 15 minutes especially is Ballantyne.  This tells me that other people have noticed the issues also.  the chips to start were much thicker and overcooked than they should be, the salsa was completely lacking in flavor and the entire \"chips and salsa\" experience kind of sucked.  

I ordered the pork carnita tacos.  They now serve the tacos in this metal stand up thingy which is cool, in theory so the tacos don't tip over and dump out all of the stuff inside.  The problem is that the stand up thing is metal and they heat the plate up and besides the plate being piping hot when they serve it the metal stand up thing is like 400 degrees so you can't get to your taco until it cools off about 20 minutes after they set the plate down.  the tacos themselves also were lacking in flavor and were so greasy that I had to let them drip free of that orange color pizza type grease before I could eat them.  Beans and rice were, well, beans and rice. All in all it wasn't a good meal.
I would prefer to have them raise their prices and beef up their quality to the level that they had years ago.  Right now it's pretty similar to going to every other Mexican joint and we already have plenty of those."}
{"text":"Zapata's, tu es OK, amigo.

No muy bueno, no muy mal. Tu es asi asi.

Seriously folks - Zapata's is great for those people who don't love Mexican food. Or who don't like spicy things. Or who have 5 kids to feed with the purchase of 1 entree on Tuedays (or whatever day that is).

But for those true Meh He Cano cuisine lovers out there, skip Zapata's and come to East Charlotte to party with the authentic places. If you don't want to drive that far, head to Stonecrest and enjoy some Cantina 1511. But don't waste anytime here - you'll leave saying \"Eh... it was alright\" and to be honest, life's too short to eat OK Mexican food."}
{"text":"Beers are cold, pina coladas are delicious and food is great!!!
My favorites are the fresh guacamole, the enchiladas and the carne asada.  The restaurant is family friendly.  It's our weekly Friday night spot!!!

Ps... Carmen is our favorite server!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been many times, and the quality gets worse. Tonight will be the last time my husband and I ever go here again. We where seated quickly. I ordered the Carnitas de Puerco dish. Plate was hot, but the meat was cold! Yuk! What where they thinking? Is this food microwaved? And they where not even busy. Never again!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Charlotte. Consistently good, decently priced, and fabulous atmosphere."}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about this place is the waitress was very friendly.  The chips and salsa were bland. The burrito was very boring. The carnitas tacos were dry. Nothing interesting or fresh.   Definitely not going back again."}
{"text":"Food made my stomach hurt so bad, it tastes good but has tons of MSG. Probably because I normally eat clean and eating something so unhealthy is bond to make your stomach react. The waiter couldn't remember our order, drinks were okay. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I saw all the negative reviews on here, then all the positive reviews and we figured, how bad can Mexican food really be? Well, the service was substandard (waitress didn't really interact with us or come to check on us at all during the meal) to start. But the food? So plain and flavorless. I could have made the taco salad myself...it was iceberg lettuce with ground beef that looked like it had a packet of seasoning thrown in, just like I make at home. The tacos I got were just okay, but didn't wow me. We were bummed because we had been eating at all wonderful restaurants during our time in Charlotte for 4 days, but then we had to end on this note before driving back to the airport. Normally I'm not as critical about restaurants as most other people, but this one was really not great in our book. Will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"It's fun inside! Don't let the generic, strip mall exterior fool you. Had a great veggie meal (especially awesome refried beans and Spanish rice) and tasty salted Margarita, surrounded by Mexican tile and floor to ceiling decor. Friendly, attentive and quick service."}
{"text":"I am not from NC originally from Cali but for the week that I have been here so far, I have been coming here everyday!!! The salsa is out of this world... The jalape√±o enchiladas is just freaking amazing love love love the food and the manager Edgar is absolutely awesome!
Definitely recommend this place...
You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Zapata's when I'm in the area.  The food, atmosphere and staff are great.  I've tried several dishes and have been impressed with everything so far!  The only thing I'm not a fan of is the salsa, it's lacking flavor to me."}
{"text":"This place is no bueno. We came here last night around 730pm. There was no one at the hostess stand. We waited and waited. There was a few people that came after us and they ended up leaving. I wish we would of done the same thing. I saw a phone at the stand and I called from my cell phone hoping that would trigger someone to come up front...Nope. I finally went to the bar and spoke with the bartender. He sat us right away but it took forever for someone to come greet us! 

I ordered a fajita burrito with steak. When I received it, I saw it had chicken in it. Took forever for the server to come back so we can tell her the issue. I got my burrito with steak but it was very sloppy looking from them rushing. My husband got the chicken fajitas and it was sooooooooooooo greasy and oily. I've never seen fajitas like that. 

Very disappointing. Looking at the other reviews I'm surprised that they are rated either very good or very low. There are so many other good mexican restaurants in the ballantyne area and I just can't believe the service here was that bad."}
{"text":"I was very reluctant to come to this place due to the almost all horrible reviews. We got a $10 coupon in the mail so figured ok what the heck let's try it. Surprisingly the atmosphere was fantastic the food was great and the service was incredible. My fianc√© and I both ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla and cheese dip that's was very delicious. Our server was Lucia and she truly gave good customer service. I have worked in hospitality for 7 years so I know what it takes."}
{"text":"My wife and i were in the mood for Mexican and decided to try Zapata's. What an awesome choice. We got there right around 1 and were a little scared that there wasn't much of a crowd inside, but decided to push on. We were quickly greeted and seated.  The inside is nice and cozy with a outdoor/indoor southwest/Mexican theme. As soon as we were seated a server brought us a huge bowl of salsa chips and two glasses of water. 

We figured out that the water was to help with the spice in the salsa, unfortunately that's the only thing good about the salsa it was tomato paste based so it tasted a little like spicy pizza sauce to me.  We also ordered a thing of cheese dip. Smokey, spicy, large (it felt like that bowl was bottomless)  and delicious. For lunch my wife ordered the nachos, large portion of chips  topped with chicken, beans, peppers, sour cream, and guacamole.  She liked them but f.y.i. they use shredded chicken,& shredded cheese vs fajita chicken & cheese dip.  I ordered the fish tacos.  (3 flour tortillas with thin sliced fried fish with a chipotle cream sauce served with rice and beans) These puppies were awesome. They were pretty spicy but soooooo very good.  All in all it was GREAT food GREAT service  only thing i could find any fault on was the salsa. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The food was unimpressive. The waitress hounded us about ordering - every 2 minutes she came by but then when I wanted a refill and a box I couldn't find her. There are lots of Mexican Restaurants around here to pick from and this one just isn't good enough to return to."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and really like the food here.  Unfortunately, the portion sizes (at least for the meat) have gotten smaller and the prices have really gone up.  My wife and I ate here tonight, had 2 Carne Asada's, water and a soda - $38!  There isn't much meat on the plate anymore, lots of rice and beans.  That is just WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for this type of food.  I guess that is why it is no longer crowded in here.  We'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Mexican food, both authentic and well, to be nice, not so authentic.  Zapata's was amazing! I had been here years ago, pre-Yelp, and I remembered it was good, but this was outstanding. I loved everything about this place! The atmosphere and decor are adorable! Very clean seating area and restroom. The food was amazing and the service was perfect.  Everything was hot and we never had to ask for anything.  Refills before we even knew we needed them, napkins before the crumbs hit our laps. Our server and her assistant we very attentive. We couldn't have asked for better service.  We will definitely be back now that we are back in the area!"}
{"text":"I'll begin with one pro...once you are finally seated and once your order is finally taken, the food comes out reall fast.  Similar to what others have said, there was a little bit of a wait at the hostess stand because there was no one there. Once seated, it took a little while for someone to take my order.  You can just a Mexican restaurant by the chips and salsa. I should have known that food wouldn't be good because the chips and salsa weren't good.  The chips were very bland and the salsa was just hot and soupy. I ordered a combination with one taco, one enchilada, tice and beans.  It was pretty expensive, at least IMO, $11.25.  The taco was pretty good. The enchilada and rice were flavorless.  I didn't try the beans, they were very runny though.  The person that cleared the table, asked if I wanted dessert. The waiter then came and asked if I wanted dessert, then finally came back and asked if I wanted my check. All and all the food wasn't good and I left they're paying almost $20 for a taco, enchilada and a sweet tea. I don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Hola Hey Victor! You wanna get married, because THAT margarita is making this girrrl fall in love, & feel all kinds of happy.

Now that I'm done proposing, I can start on this fine review. K so your girl just so happens to dabble in the art of pairing different things (pool, streaking, dancing on bars, proposing to the bartender, steak, peanut butter, pancakes) with a perfect margarita.

Victor makes my favorite margarita of all time. Hand squeezed citrus (As a good husband would), lots of my fav tequila and when he sees me bustin through the doors, he starts whippin up that pitcher (momma didn't raise no.....) & this makes me very happy. (Happy wife happy life).   Oh yeah and the fejitas are bommmmmmb diggity bomb. They help me not pass out and stuff.

Go here people!!!! Go to the bar and sayyygg Que Pasa to Victor :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. I love the atmosphere. Their food is great and the service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. We've been looking for a Mexican restaurant close by ever since moving from Boston a year ago. This might not be the best we have ever tried, but it did the trick and we will be back. I had an enchilada plate and my honey had the street tacos. Both were good and enough food to take home for lunch the next day. We also had the fresh guacamole (yummy!) with their fresh, warm tortilla chips. You might be able to find more authentic Mexican along South Blvd, but this is a good neighborhood alternative."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pollo Fundido and it wasn't what I expected at all. The description made it sound like an amazing and delicious dish but what came to the table was four squares of dry chicken with a slice of American cheese melted on top. If I knew this was what I was getting I wouldn't have ordered it... Especially not for 12.99. The free chips were great and the salsa was good but that was a disappointing meal. Would not recommend. The reviews definitely were misleading."}
{"text":"Update: My main gripe was getting slow service frequently and they've improved. So I will up my rating by 1 star.

Most of the food is good, I especially like their tacos. The staff are also nice and friendly. The place is also beautifully decorated.

The problem occurs with service. Like I said, the staff are nice but they can usually be slow and not come around to your table very often. This is being based off multiple visits, about 10 visits. Sometimes service is great! But 70% of the time food can be slow to come out on non busy times, drinks can take a while to be refilled, and there's been a couple times where processing the check takes a long time.

So they need to work on service. But based off how many times I've said I visited, foods good. When they bring out your chips, ask for some queso dip, it's AWESOME."}
{"text":"Went here this evening and the service was terrible, and we were one of three people in the entire restaurant when we came. First of all when we came in every single employee was sitting on their phones, even the host, who continued to stay on their phone even after we walked up. We had to get up twice during our dinner to ASK for water and we again had to go find our waitress to get our check. We could even see our waitress putting on lipstick and makeup in the corner who failed to come and check on us even once, meanwhile we had empty water glasses the whole time. The food was lukewarm and too salty. When we left, every employee was sitting around and on their phones which was extremely unprofessional. I'm not sure how this place is still in business but I WILL NOT be returning."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Zapata's for the past decade.  I am 100% addicted to their Chimichanga and go back often for them.  I don't venture out often to other menu items, but I have had many family and birthday dinner's here and everyone always expresses how good the food is.  It is always our go-to when we have out of town guest visiting.

The loss of a star is because while the food is always good, the quality of service can vary.  Sometimes it seems like there are not enough staff present so you end up with slower service or you get a different server each time someone comes to the table."}
{"text":"Be careful. Very deceptive establishment. The drink specials are BS - they will bait & switch you, serving you a bigger version of the drink on special and then charge you full price. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"We ordered take out, so maybe it's worse than the food they serve, but first of all, I asked for beans and rice for my daughter, and they failed to tell me that the entree I ordered came with beans and rice, and then we paid for a 2nd order! Hello?  Anyone there thinking?  The take out took a long time, maybe 30 minutes, and the food was average at best. Greasy, watery, and worse than your typical Mexican. Salsarita's Fresh Cantina is much better! Plus, it's expensive!  $50 for 4 orders plus the rip off beans and rice? Get outta here!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. Like, a legit, loyal and unwavering love. I have reviewed my favorite place (Three Amigos), which is awesome. So awesome that you should stop reading this and just go to Three Amigos and eat an empanada. 

Zapatas is not delicious. At all. We went for a friend's birthday party. They were closing at 11 and we were the last to get there so they told our friend we had to order at 10:30 if we wanted to eat. So, without seeing a menu, we just ordered a standard chimichanga via our friend over the phone. When we got there, our food was on the table. Here is how I knew it was going to be not so good - the refried beans had melted CHEDDAR cheese on it. Not the normal, name-I-don't-know white cheese but shredded cheddar you get from Harris Teeter. It was not tasty at all. The rice was bland. The chimichanga was dry. I honestly have nothing good to say other than I hope you read my post and avoid this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Marco Polo Shrimp tacos. They were very tasty. The problem those is that it was a little pricey for what it was (seems you could say that about most of the menu)."}
{"text":"First time eating here and my experience was pretty good. Service was good, attentive. I had the pork carnitas and they were actually some of the best I ever had. The obligatory chips and salsa weren't bad either. The salsa had a nice kick of heat. I will try the place again."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, and still a lot of eclectic options too. Don't miss the jalapeno queso, and their tacos are the real deal! Also, their sangria is really good too. If you go, ask for Karla; she's awesome!"}
{"text":"It's okay. The food is fast and the people are friendly, but it's really not anything special."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. They are always consistent, food hot and fresh. The drinks are huge and strong like I like them. The wings are so good, I ordered them every visit. My last visit was take out, I ordered fish tacos I wouldn't recommend doing that. They are better to eat dining in, they were soggy and bland. But I would still recommend Zapata's to anyone that like Mexican food."}
{"text":"My work crew ordered out for Cinco de Mayo. I ordered the Vegetarian Trio, it was good but nothing spectacular. Dinner price was kinda high in my opinion for take out and portion size.

This is definitely not a taqueria... with cheap prices and amazing flavors.. I have yet to find a place like this in Charlotte/the Southeast.

Maybe I'll return during lunch instead and try a special."}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was very good.  Salsa for chips had good heat.  I had burrito and my dining companion had a quesadilla.  Burrito was huge and flavors OK--not sure if I would order again. I have been here before, and the food seemed better.  The margarita wasn't very good at all--not sure if there was any alcohol--very sweet, a lot of juice!

The prices are good, and will come back to try something different. Won't order the margarita, at least without mention to put some booze in!!!"}
{"text":"Try the TIO PIO...Does that mean Uncle Pio?  It is basically a bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp taco with a cilantro cream sauce...scrumptious..."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place, but the service and food were both disappointing. After being seated we were served chips & salsa. The chips were stale & the salsa looked liked a soup, too runny for my liking. I requested new chips & they were just as bad as the first. As for our entrees, we had quesadillas & shrimp and chicken fajitas. The chicken in the quesadilla was non-existent and the fajita chicken tasted like they used taco seasoning out of a package. The rice and beans were the best part of the meal.
As for the service, horrible. I know it was Friday night, but we could not did our server & when he did show up seemed very rude & rushed."}
{"text":"The food was bland. The \"Patron\" Margarita was weak. The plating was unappetizing with watery refried beans covering 1/3 of the plate. Previously I had ordered a guacamole salad in the middle of the afternoon. The salad appeared to have been made much earlier....not eatable. I don't know why I went back."}
{"text":"Cute place. It feels like small trip to Mexico. 
Interior is very colorful, with so much of interesting decorating things. 
We ordered pollo fundidos and Bombay chimichanga-meat free. Both dishes were awesome. This Bombay chimichanga dish comes with all the vegetables into it with salad for neutralizing. The vegetables were absolutely smooth in taste. Pollo fundidos has very flavorful and well cooked chicken. 
I liked the nachos's hot sauce dip too. 
Like the place for there food and cool interior.."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had in NC. I seek out good Mexican being a SoCal native. Try the Worlds Best Tacos. They are fantastic"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. I wasn't expecting much and I go more than expected. 
Simply put, this is a good ole' casual Mexican place. Nothing fancy, but quick, large portions of tasty Mexican tastiness which is priced very reasonably.
I sat outside and our waiter was quick.The guacamole & queso were tasty followed by their enchiladas. I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Zapata's serves some of the most authentic Mexican food I've ever had. Chimichangas, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, the whole spread. The service left a little to be desired but this was easily balanced by the quality of food, not to mention the $8 Patron margaritas that were on special."}
