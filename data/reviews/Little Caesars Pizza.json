{"text":"Slow, didn't even have 1 pepperoni and 1 crazy bread ready... Thursday night too, understaffed?"}
{"text":"The worst pizza place. Take note that you can call in an order come to pick it up and they give your pizza away and you have to wait 10 mins for them to make another. Second time I ordered online said for me to pick it up at 7:05pm got here at 7:15 they gave my pizza away again even though I already paid online in advance. I rather go to Papa John's less stress and I get my pizza before the estimated  time. Oh and hot n ready pizzas are never ready there's a wait."}
{"text":"This location is the worse little ceaser I had ever gone to pick up pizza . The \"hot and ready\" are never ready! They seem to hire teenagers and they lack of careless towards the pizza . EVERY TIME I come here , the pizza is always soggy and the doe is raw . This seems to happen when I pick up when the lady with bandana is working . AND THEY PUT TO MUCH SAUCE . Thy forgot that pizza is NEVER good with a lot of sauce it makes it sourer and they seem to feel that their \"hooking us up\". PLEASE GET THIS LOCATION FIXED ASAP"}
{"text":"Went to pick up a hot n ready pizza at 6:00pm on a Monday and the doors were locked! What is going on there???"}
{"text":"6:26pm no cheeze pizza every time ! What does hot and ready mean?"}
{"text":"Ok So I love Little Caesar's =) The prices are great especially when I have a full house on the weekends... The taste is really good considering they are only 5 dollars!!! The store could use some remodeling its way to small for a large rush!"}
{"text":"Very busy, good pizza for $5, but the hot and ready is rarely hot and ready, but you normally don't wait too long. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Strongley would not consider going 3 times i went becouse i really like little ceas but this kid with balck hair and ering who looks like hes managing but treats you worse then i ever been treated he was pissed that i showed up right when they opened and he had make a pizza the stuff crust pepperoni but its wasnt just that time i showed up 2 more times and he acted the same way like he was on drugs"}
{"text":"It's not great, but you get what you pay for, and if you're on a budget or have young kids it's a good deal to be able to feed four people for around $11. I'm not a big fan of their regular crust pizza, but they're Sicilian is actually kind of decent. Again you get what you pay for. It's better than toppers"}
{"text":"This location consistently misses the meaning of the phrase \"hot and ready. I used to order a peperoni deep dish but I got tired of the \"that will be 10 minutes, sir.\" I switched to round pizzas as most the pies coming out of the oven were round but low and behold there is a wait for rounds too. I guess this locacation doesn't get that if I wanted to wait, I would go to Barro's or Pizza Hut.  If I want hot and ready, I have to go to the Litchfield location. at least they know what hot and ready means."}
{"text":"Out of the several of these LCP's that I have visited this one is ok, the pizza was cooked well, ample ingredients, a good amount of sauce but you could tell it was put together too quickly, not uniform consistency with the ingredients like cheese and toppings, but for $5.54 it was hot, it was ready, and it was ok. Staff was friendly and they worked quick.  Other locations take their time and get it right like Valle Verde in Henderson, but this Silverado location wasn't bad ."}
{"text":"We went there last night around 8:30 and the employees were eating brownies at the register.  They licked their fingers clean and went right back to making pizzas.  We didn't even walk in after seeing that.  Was very disgusting to witness.  Will never go there again!  The one in el mirage is way cleaner and the pizza comes out better."}
{"text":"Ordered Hot n Ready , after paying was told to wait 10 minutes. I sat in this place for 25 minutes.  HOT N READY doesn't exist here because this happened twice this week to me.   As I'm typing this another customer is complaining about the save thing.  The quality of the food is the worse - my 3 year old could have put the toppings on better.   What a waste of 30 dollars."}
{"text":"I like Little ceaser pizzas...especially the crest which falls between thick and thin category ..besides u never feel heavy after eating their pizza..."}
{"text":"I special ordered a pizza with very little red sauce.  Got it home and it had too much sauce.  Drove back and clerk laughed and said \"we realized that we have you the wrong pizza after you left.\"  No I'm sorry. No offer refund. Just ordered another pizza.  Got it home SAME PROBLEM.  WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great..I ordered a hot n ready FRESH with butter parmesan on it. It was delicious & fresh & hot..all for 6.50..the interior was pretty clean, but as I walked up to the door there was a homeless person who made kind of like a couch and was sitting outside asking for $ as you leave the store :("}
{"text":"Worst service and cold pizza ever. Ordered and went to pay just to find out they won't accept large denomination bills ( no sign stating this ).  Went to get change expecting them to fix my order while I was gone bet no way.  Was told that they don't fix the pizza until it is paid for.  While waiting another customer came in to pick up an order he called in 30 min earlier and was told the same thing, he told them where they could put their pizza! A third customer standing in line just walked out.  I asked for their corporate number which got me the cold shoulder treatment and an additional 10 min wait for a cold \" hot and ready\" pizza. Another customer was ahead of me and was asked if they wanted crazy bread for their wait but when their pizza was finally ready was told they would have to wait another 10 min for the bread,  what a crock of shit this place is.  I called the supervisor Travis and after getting the roundabout through the answering machine left a voice mail which WAS NOT returned.  I hope their corporate office reads this because I filled out their survey which is a joke also.  I use to stop here at least once a week but never again.  I wish I could give them negative stars!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for  Call ahead if you want anything other than 1 single pepperoni pizza and a 2liter  Like the other review said, the parking lot is always \"interesting\"  -people hanging out in front of the cell phone store and the store that sells \"smoking accessories and white t-shirts\"  -people playing loud rap music out of their cars with the doors open -people wandering around like zombies looking at the ground on their phones, with a belt on, buckled at the knees with their boxer shorts hanging out"}
{"text":"You might as well have 3 speds run the kitchen only 3 workers 10 people came in for hot and readys not 1 was ready she said 5 min wait no one waited less than 15"}
{"text":"Today was the worse. A customer in front of me ordered crazy bread, and she said they were burnt, I glanced over, and clearly they were brown. In the past, I've ordered crazy bread, and they were never brown. The customer asked for fresh ones.. The worker put the burnt ones back in the case, and stomped off making unnecessary banging noises and went to make new ones. She didnt tell me she'd be right with me, she just walked away. By this time she had major attitude. 2 other guys walked thru the waiting area speaking loudly about Eminem, totally ignoring the customer service part of their job. I timed my wait time which was 12 minutes, before I walked out. I was never acknowledged at all. In the time I waited, I noticed how dirty and disgusting the employees looked, not to mention their work space, gross. I should have known better, 5$ pizza, trailer trash employees gets you bullshit quality and a waste of time. Pizza Hut it is from now on!"}
{"text":"Worst fast food experience ever!! Out of all the different places I've gotten food, whether it's fast food places or restaurants, this Little Caesar's is by far the worst place I've ever been to. Even McDonald's can serve me 10x better.  They told me it's going to be a 10-15 min wait which I didn't mind, but I ended up waiting for at least 40 min. Not only that but once I got home and opened the box they gave me the wrong order. I asked for a regular deep deep dish pizza that has stuffed crusts and I got a regular pepperoni deep dish with no stuffed crust and the worker there didn't even give me my receipt.  Worst place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Wont be coming back! Very busy, employees very slow. Wait times 45mins-1.5hrs even for a hot ready pizza. Which there suppose to have ready and stock. Service sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"It's the holidays and instead of having their sign saying closed. The server tells me later after ordering, that they can't serve anything because there is \"stuff\" in the way. Addition to not even apologizing for the convince either. Poor service."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon wrapped deep dish with pepperoni and Hawaiian. When I got home I realized we got the Hawaiian, but my deep dish was just a plain deep dish with no toppings. I did see that we were charged for what we received so we did not both to go back and complain or anything and I believe that the cashier was being trained at the time. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again some day."}
{"text":"Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies."}
{"text":"Its never everrrrrrrrrrr hot n ready.   so be prepared to wait at least 8 to 10 mins, whats the point of coming here if its not for the pizza being hot n ready.   no wait time for the reg pizza but if its something else forget it.....8 mins at least,   Have it ready cook more specialty pies that are ready to go as well.  Get on the ball people"}
{"text":"Pizza is fine, location is great, staff is nice , but every single time I come here its NEVER EVER \"Hot n ready\" so with that said I see some false advertising here.  Everytime I come I have to wait at least 8 mins if its for ICB or the new one thats out with the pretzel crust, so beware its never hot n ready people. Be prepared to wait,   so I highly suggest who ever owns this spot needs to talk to their staff to get on the ball and start having pizza ready to go,"}
{"text":"The pizza is standard Little Caesars pizza.  Can't complain about that at $5/pizza.  The B grade from the health dept was somewhat disturbing, especially when I see a guy with a huge afro in the back making pizza without a hair net on.  Was totally surprised I didn't find a hair in my pizza."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst little Caesars in Las Vegas and probably the world.  I will never, never ever step foot in this place again!!! The management is a joke! I've been here multiple time and they can't seem to get shit right.  I mean your a pizza place that serves a limited menu, how hard is it to get an order right 50% of the time.  I literally just got back from this place a few minutes ago and instead of eating I am too upset that I'd rather write this review, in hopes that i save someone else's time.   I called and placed a phone order, a bestest light sauce and cheese light sauce.  I was advised that my order would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 22 min. later and was advised that it would be another 5 min as my pizza had just been placed in the oven.  Okay, fine, whatever..i asked are you sure 5 min. and they assured me it would.  Well, that was an absolute bold face lie.  I waited impatiently as person after person walks in and placed and order and leaves!  No pizza after 5 min., none after 10, none after 15 and none after 20!!! Seriously!! 22 additionally minutes waiting in the store and I finally get my pizza.  \"Oh I am sorry about the wait\" is seriously not enough! This has happened multiple time at this location.  I  heard them talking and they said they gave my pizza to someone else, they did not tell me this, they should have.   We have a few pizza places in Vegas, literally anyone one would be better than this rip off place.  I mean if you see pizza at a dumpster it be better!!"}
{"text":"The garlic cheese bread and crazy bread were great. The service was also extremely friendly. I imagine the pizza is the standard Little Caesars pizza, but I only step foot in these paces for the crazy bread."}
{"text":"The service here is actually very horrible. I've been going here often, and every time I pick up my pizza, either the employees are horsing around, throwing stuff at one another, or they are extremely rude and sarcastic. Or both, on accession. Also, multiple times, my pizza wasn't even cut into slices. The manager doesn't seem to really care, as this has been going on for months now."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again."}
{"text":"This is good pizza for the price. They make it up quick and accept call in orders (but you have to pick it up - no delivery)."}
{"text":"The customer service is here atrocious.  The last thing I was at as an adult is to hear some cashier call me \"playa\" or \"boss\" and then tell me he \"acted a fool\" when he forgot my change.  Are you serious? I understand this is little Caesars but I wasn't aware we were in the ghetto. I guess I forgot because I was \"actin a fool\""}
{"text":"Why is it that there is never a hot and ready pizza ready when you show up. I thought that was the whole point, so you don't have to wait. Waited for 10 minutes for crazy bead to go with the pizza. When bread was ready, there was no more pizza. Now have to wait for pizza. When more pizza is ready, you guessed it, no more bread."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my house so I only get it when I feel like walking, its too close to drive.  Like others have said its only $5, which should make up for the quality but Hungry Howies is also $5 and tastes so much nicer. I also think the pizza is a little bit bigger at Howies.   I only go when I want pizza and feel like going for a walk. I always think after I should have got Howies."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. If orders take a not they are very apologetic and really try and make up for it."}
{"text":"\"Hot-N-Ready\"?... I don't think so.  I've been there 4 times, each time I have to wait 5-10 minutes for a cheese pizza. Why do I go back you ask. I just want to see if they ever have one hot n ready. The day that the do, I'm going to throw confetti in the air, then never go back. Arizona Authentic Pizza is better and the same price."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience and last time I go to  a Little Caesar's restaurant.First of all it was close to noon and hard to tell if this store was open, because the open sign wasn't illuminated and it appeared no one was inside. Upon entering, a teenager came out to take my order with no greeting or \"may I help you.\" So she proceeded to take my order, I paid and she said it will take 10 minutes. During my wait I hear what appears to be teenagers in the back playing around and telling jokes, and saying racial slurs(the n-word) to be exact. Very unprofessional behavior and offensive to me as a customer. On top of that the pizzas and crazy bread tasted horrible and made my wife sick, so I definitely won't be coming back.  For a well-established food chain, the employees working at this location tarnish your image. They are disrespectful, immature, and could cause you to lose valuable customers. Racial slurs being used in the presence of your customers is NEVER acceptable. I would NEVER recommend my worse enemy to buy ANYTHING from this location."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place, employees have gotten better but as far as hot and ready and $5 pizzas never happens  !!! Never any pizzas ready long wait god forbid you ask for an additional topping they say 10 mins for everyone but there there for 45 mins for there \"hot and ready\"  I do not know why I keep coming here every 3 months ! I figured they figured it out but I guess I'm the fool I will not be back ever , ohhhhhj let me ad this I just got my pizza ... asked for the deep dish and received hand tossed   then they make it my fault some how but the other 6 peeps I front of me all had the same problem."}
{"text":"Why would i call and order ahead if you dont set aside large phone orders? What awaste of my time."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible went to get a \"hot and ready pizza and box\" which is supposed to be ready between the hours of 4 and 8 p.m. at 7:24 p.m. here it is 8 p.m. and I still have not received my order which I was told would be ready in 12 to 15 minutes this place is terrible terrible terrible and I will no longer be spending my money at this particular little Little Caesars if any Little Caesars Domino's here I come"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service...routinely wait 15+ minutes on multiple occasions even w/ calling order in. Staff is unorganized & overwhelmed. The price is right, but I will not go back until I hear that these issues have been rectified."}
{"text":"When you pre order and give them plenty of time they still don't have your order ready! There's no point of pre ordering if they are still going to make you wait! If I could give them ZERO star I would!"}
{"text":"Always disappointed with this location. We live close by and have gone in several times to grab a Hot-N-Ready pizza after a long day. The problem is that there never are any available, which negates the point of Hot-N-Ready. We usually have to wait 10-15 minutes. Then after waiting we usually get a subpar pizza, which I know I can't complain too much since it is only $5, but still, when a pizza is missing most of its cheese is it still a pizza?"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with a reasonably priced large pepperoni pizza. Fast service and never had any issues with them."}
{"text":"It's little Caesars and it's great! The deep deep dish is my go to and I'm glad to see they are still around and doing well.  One thing to know is everything is Ala carte."}
{"text":"I placed an order the night before around 8pm on Monday 6/1 for the next morning (6/2). I call around 10:30am that morning (6/2) to be sure they received my order and that it will be ready on time at 10:50am for pickup and she said yes. When I got there at 10:47am she says they're not ready, in fact, they didn't even start my order!! My order was an order of 4 pizzas for a luncheon event I was hosting for future clients. So I asked how long it would take and she said 10 minutes and I said fine. I end up waiting about 15-20 minutes. I arrive to the event I'm hosting 5 minutes late because of it and still need to set up the tables and other food I had besides the pizza. We ended up close to running out of pizza so I figured I would call Little Caesars and give them another chance. I order 2 more, one cheese and once pepperoni and I ask how long she said it's going to be ready in 20 minutes and I said \"no worries.\" 15 minutes pass and I call before I head over to pickup so I am certain I will not wait again and this time it's a guy and he says it's going to take 5 more minutes and I go \"that's fine because I'll be there in 10 minutes.\" I get there in 10 minutes like I said and they say it's not ready, AGAIN!!!! She says it'll take like 2 or 5 minutes (can't remember if 2 or 5). I end up waiting there for 10 MINUTES AT LEAST!!! AND when I finally get my 2 pizzas I find out when I got back to the event that they gave me 2 CHEESE instead of one cheese and one pepperoni!!! That's when I didn't bother talking to them and asked for the manager and she said he wasn't there so I gave her my number and told her to have him call me since she didn't know when he would be there. What kind of business is he running?!? Then Cody, the GM calls me (6/2) and leaves me a voicemail apologizing for the incident and that he'd like to discuss about what happened in person. I call him back about 3 hrs. later and I leave him a voicemail since he didn't pick up. Haven't heard back from him. I host at least 2 events a month, so they lost future business. I give it a one star because she (the employee) was very sorry and I could tell that she just doesn't have a great manager and owner to be helping her succeed in the business. No support or a team at this Little Caesars. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE and CUSTOMER SERVICE! I will listen to the Yelp reviews from now on."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever great customer service! Yeah maybe you wait like 2 mins alot better than most pizza places!"}
{"text":"Nasty store its so dirty and i try to place an order they wont answer the phones, worst location ever"}
{"text":"I am Huge on Customer Service, and this location, sadly, has none.   I have visited this location a few times.   In my experiences, I have noticed that there is Very Little organization or management of the employees.  Everyone seems to be wandering around with a completely perplexed look on their face, while ignoring customers as they walk in the door.  When the employee at the register Does Finally acknowledge the customer's presence, they do not seem focused on what the customer is ordering, leading to incorrect orders and frequent mistakes, thus leading to a line of irate customers trailing out the door.   This location simply needs 2 things desperately;  Proper Management and Employees that take pride in their job."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! A bunch of kids working there with NO work ethic. Went in at 930 and they said they didn't have anything available. I said I'd wait ( I mean how long does it take to make a pepperoni pizza?).  They declined, because they had already started cleaning. I'd give a half star if I could. Every trip there has been dreadful."}
{"text":"I don't eat this trash often because the food is as inconsistent as the people that work here. The owner must have a few around the area because it's the same trash everywhere. If you like pizza, spend $5 more and buy a descent pie from anybody else but Little Caesars. Most recently their cc machines were down. The cashier explained that their internet was turned off because someone forgot to pay the bill. Customers were irritated due to the inconvenience but no one would even offer an apology for the trouble. Just like the pizza the employees are overdone. Stay away."}
{"text":"I work for a living and I have a timed lunch. When you advertise that you open at 10:30 am, you should probably open at 10:30 am. This has been several times now that the restaurant has been locked at even 10:45. I tried to call the phone # just to hear the employees inside giggling and ignoring the phone.Do yourself a favor if you really need the bargain pizza for lunch, just drive to the Rainbow store, at least those guys show up on time. The only reason they got 1 is because yelp won't let me give 0"}
{"text":"I bought two pizzas. One was the New Pretzel pizza and the other one was pepperoni pizza. I just got done throwing up.  I was just fine, before I ate the  New Pretzel Pizza.  I am very disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"I went in here on a Thursday night for a quick \"Hot-n-Ready\" deep dish pepperoni pizza for my family. I waited for about 10 minutes and they said they messed up my order. How do you mess up a pepperoni pizza? I had to wait another 10 minutes to finally receive my order. The pizza does not look like the one on the menu. It was under cooked, chewy and disgusting I am highly unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"Having worked at a Little Caesar's years ago, I can say that I know what goes on in the back of the restaurant. Here, it seems as though they have a working system in the back with respect to making the pizzas, but customer service is bad. The staff here are more concerned with what's going on after work or who's dating \"so-and-so\" that the customer is more of an inconvenience than anything. A boost in customer service would do wonders for this place."}
{"text":"WTF, THIS PLACE IS NOT HOT AND READY.. ITS SLOW AND STEADY FOR REAL. All the workers are like 12. They are pissed they work there. I wait atleast 15-30 min when I come here.Heres what happened on my latest pizza expierience... I ordered a hot n ready pepperoni and a cheese, well the pepperoni wasnt ready as per usual, so I waited 15-20 minutes... So when it was ready, they gave me my 2 pizzas. I got home and the peperroni was fine and fresh, the cheese pizza was like brown ass cheese, looked like it had been sitting for 3 to 4 hrs, and to top it off, the person that cut it must have been cross eyed, cuz that shit was all kinds off double cut, slivers, single cut, What kinds cut would you like?well this pizza was all kinds of cut. I wanted to throw it away, but my son was hungry and doesnt eat pepperoni so he picked out the edible nibblers and we gave the rest to the dogs..."}
{"text":"Waiting line was a little bit longer than usual... Not enough manpower?? What?? A 15 to 20 minutes wait???? Lol.."}
{"text":"This location is close to home and seeing how they advertise hot and ready pizzas. You would think you could swing by and grab a pizza after a long 10 hour shift. They are complete unprepared for a dinner rush, and beyond unprofessional. The only employee I saw busting their butt was a older women behind the register. The other younger employees are goofing around in the back. This location is very small and now room for waiting which make things intimate, awkward and allows you to hear the employees in the back not doing there job. There is a very dirty care bear in their drink display as well as the front counter is disgusting. I order a simple cheese and pep pizza, nothing to hard. Although to watch people who came in after me to walk out with the same thing it's infuriating. Seriously Wtf. Severely disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and fresh. I have to rate this place because everytime I go in, I'm impressed.  No matter how slammed they are, It's always fast.  Employees bust their butts here.  $5 pizza is a great value"}
{"text":"Went to this location for a $5 deep dish and drink special.  All the soda was room temperature.  The lady bragged the pizza just came out of the oven.  It was doughy.  Nearly raw pizza and warm drink.  I'll stick with the Reems and Waddell location"}
{"text":"We called in our order and when we got there we had to wait an additional 30 minutes. After some of us getting so frustrated we went inside to see what was going on. My boyfriend then asked the cashier what was going on with our food we called ahead of time and still have been waiting for 30 minutes. The cashier then looks at him and says \"I don't really give a F***\". I have been in customer service for a very long time and I couldn't believe someone would actually talk to a paying customer this way. I have read a lot of negative reviews for this location and how disrespectful the employees are. My boyfriend then started to argue with the employee and the employee started to take off his apron implying he was going to fight him. Things were not handled correctly at all by this crappy pizza joint. We then left with no food AND no refund. When trying to get a refund the next day, the manager said he could not refund the money and refused to give us the employees name involved with this altercation. So then today, the manager calls my boyfriends work to speak with his manager to tell them he came in trying to fight their employee. I cannot believe the disrespect we have received by you people it is completely unacceptable. You should really look into what kind of people you are hiring to represent your company because these guys are a bunch of morons. Get it together...  I wish I could give this place negative stars."}
{"text":"Great food, however I did receive horrible customer service from Cecila H. She was very rude about my order and was not friendly at all. We called in our order to give them a heads up and her attitude went down hill from there. She slide my card as if she was trying to break it."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I went in to get a pizza and crazy bread and an I.C.B and the man that was working showed me only the I.C.B and it was fine so I took my things and went to go and when I got into the car I looked at the pizza and it was cold and just looking at was not pleasant so I went back talked to the same man and he said\"sorry but you took the pizza out of the restaurant and I can not give you another one.\" I was so mad. So I then I talked to the manager and she actually handled the situation she was helpful, she said sorry and gave me another pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible. Long wait not ready at promised time. Poor customer service. Staff not wearing gloves. Will not be back. Need some leadership in this store."}
{"text":"Little Caesars @ 43rd Ave & Peoria has a sign that says free offer of breads sticks if they don't ask you if you would like a crazy bread combo. In parentheses it says bread sticks & crazy sauce. I went in there twice & both times the girl asked me if I wanted bread sticks or wings, but never said crazy combo or crazy sauce. I called her on it & she said she asked if I wanted bread sticks or wings. I knew that. 2nd time I asked to speak to manager. He said she didn't have to be specific like the sign says. I got area managers phone number and left a message. He never called back."}
{"text":"Five dollar pizza. Not great tasting, but better than a mess in the kitchen some nights."}
{"text":"I've never experienced Little Caesars when you're told it will be a 15 minute wait before you even order. It's time to order a new oven or location. Notice that I did not say crew. I could tell this crew was as ready as they could be for the slam they got on a Friday night. They had racks of pizzas ready to throw in the oven. But the oven was backed up so much that they could only put new pans on when the conveyor belt moved enough to make room for the next pan. There were team members throwing new pans together to go on the rack to wait for the oven, dough was being prepped, and staff members were even observed cleaning up.    Dear franchise owners, please do something to help out your team. You're really hanging them out to dry by not giving them the resources and space they need to serve their community."}
{"text":"Let's be straight- you only get Little Caesars because you are broke, desperate for something fast to eat, throwing a party, or you're fond of mediocre pizza.  I fall into the broke/desperate to eat categories.  Little Caesars isn't terrible.... I've certainly paid more for crappier pizza (by accident, of course- not because I enjoy torturing my wallet and taste buds).  But I don't think there's really anyone out there that says, \"Man, I sure could go for some Little Caesars right now!\"  Basically, it's tasty enough to make you think your $6 was not wasted.  Nothing more than that.    For this particular location, we've never had to wait for a hot-n-ready and we are usually in and out pretty quickly.  The employees are your typical fast food employees- not the most professional service in the world but fine enough to make a cheap pizza and swipe your credit card."}
{"text":"Complete morons!! My husband and I called and ordered a pizza. We went to pick it up 25min later. When we arrived, we gave them our name on the order and the kid then proceeded to ask us what our order was. He then asks us if we had someone come and pick it up already. Uh, no moron, that is why we are standing in front of you right now. Then he says, sorry we must have given it to someone else. They then had the balls to charge us full price and tell us we had to sit and wait 20 more minutes for the pizza. They should have apologized and at least given us a discount for THEIR mistake!!"}
{"text":"Never \"hot and ready\". I always assume that they will start making pizza ahead and have some ready, but rarely is that the case. Be prepared to wait for your \"hot and ready\" pizza."}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS closing early advise you to call before you waste your time driving here esp if its 20 mins til close they'll already be closed."}
{"text":"They advertise Hot and Ready pizza.   Don't be fooled.  Only cheese pizza available.   12 minute wait.   Boo"}
{"text":"Walked right up and snagged a fresh HOT N' READY $5 lunch combo. No waiting. Courteous service to boot! I got the Deep dish which was more than enough!"}
{"text":"Walked in 20 minutes before close and was told \"we don't have any more pizza.\"  In the 3 minutes we were there, we watched the employee behind the counter turn away 3 other customers. Great business model."}
{"text":"This location is the worst little Cesar's I've ever been to. They have no hot n ready pizzas ever ready. Its a 15 minute wait just for one pepperoni pizza, or so they say. I just waited there for about 35 minutes for a basic hot n ready pepperoni pizza. And after asking the girl working the cash register if my pizza was ready she went in the back then returns to the cash register to help other customers and didn't say anything to me about my order. Will not be coming back to this location again. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I called and placed an order. When I arrived I was told that I didn't place an order at that location because it wasn't in the system. I asked the woman behind the counter what their telephone number was and she told me. I pulled out my phone and showed her that I indeed did call and place an order 25 minutes ago. I told her what the order was and that I spoke with a male on the phone. She went in the back and I overheard/seen her talking to one of the male workers telling him that he took my order but didn't save it in the system. She came back out front and told me that no one recalled taking my order which was a lie because I had just heard her conversation with the male worker. She then proceeded to tell me that I could wait while they made the order. Why would I want to wait for an order that should have already been ready? So I'm supposed to wait twice? And the fact that she came out and lied to me was pitiful. Had she just acknowledged the mistake and apologized for it I wouldn't have even become upset. This was just all around horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza(s) were pretty tasty. I enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients. Also at an amazing low price. The workers were nice and greeted me with a smile and warm welcome."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally even take the time to review a Little Caesars. Obviously no one is here for the quality. It's mediocre pizza for cheap. Fair enough.   The service here though, is horrific. They advertise their cheese and pepperoni pizzas as \"hot and ready\", but I've almost never gotten a pizza without waiting for it. Today I ordered a cheese hot and ready, and I was told \"5-7 minutes\". It took them nearly a half hour to get it out. A cheese pizza! And I was the only customer in there! What were they doing back there that whole time?   I feel bad for the kid at the register. He's the only decent employee they have, but every single time I've gone in he's getting chewed out by angry customers for the incompetence of the staff behind him. Several times I've seen lines out the door and no more sitting space because everyone is forced to wait up to 30-45 minutes for a freaking pizza that again, is advertised as hot and ready.   My guess is that whoever wrote the previous reviews on here were employees or paid to do so. I've never seen a happy customer here. I get that bad days happen, maybe even a few in a row. But this place is consistently horrific. They desperately need a manager or the owner to go in and start cracking down because this is almost comical. I'm not coming back for a long while. If I'm going to wait a half hour for pizza, I'll pay the few extra bucks and get a good one someplace else."}
{"text":"pizza is never ever ready,  posting this during my 20 minute wait for 3 peps...  customer service is horrible, worst little caesars location we've been too,  hot-n-ready???  hot-n-never ready!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and they have your pizza ready to go, but if you go when it's rush our expect it to be busy and slow.... but I still coming here"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible my server was Dreshauna, shes so rude, no personality. Shes not suppose to work in customer service environment. Disappointed"}
{"text":"go to any Little Caesars Pizza BUT this one! every time i come here i spend 40 minutes just waiting for a pizza. I always get just one pepperoni pizza and people who order after me get their food right away. The only reason i come here is bc it's so close to my house. The people who take my order forget what i get and think \"i got my food already\" I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"Did the usual pizza on Friday night. Stopped into this location and for 2nd time no pizzas ready. Tell me 10 minutes, fine. Pay, go out to car, come back 8 minutes later and sit waiting for name to be called that order is ready. People come in get pizzas and they all leave. I asked how much longer as its been 15 plus minutes. I'm only one there and she forgot. Has my one pizza but not the other as she gave it to another customer. 25 minutes later I leave. 2nd time in a row here. There won't be a third. No apology at all. A few comments from me on customer inventory control and a \"yeah whatever\" look back. I get home and pizza stuck top of box from improper loading. You'd think the owner/manager would look at ratings here and address the obvious problems. Won't get my money again. Other locations nearby."}
{"text":"I used to love Little Ceasars and haven't eaten here for years.  I was over charged and the breadsticks I remembered being so yummy were hard, stale, and not edible.  Sadly disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place cares more about their employees than the customer. Simply asked to have my pizza cut into squares instead of triangles and was denied. Asked why they wouldn't do it and was told some lame excuse how they don't want to make extra work for employees (was talking to the owner). Cater to your customers to a reasonable point and my request was reasonable and not too hard at all. Thank you I'll just go to the windmill/pecos location instead."}
{"text":"Went in to get the advertised $8 deal and was told they didn't have it. Will never go back again, even though we settled for the regular $5 pizza. I don't like pepperoni, so I guess it's now PB&J for me. Called the manager who offered something free next time, but there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Really ! No crazy bread or garlic bread for 20 minutes. That's unacceptable. Place was dirty and people were waiting around. Shouldn't you have pizza ready."}
{"text":"The pizza is eh.. But I can eat a whole cheese bread in one sitting.. They have like 8 flavors of wings now. They always hv like 3 managers there which is weird to me plus a gang of people shoved in the back.. I dunno just my observation"}
{"text":"These guys deserve credit where it's due. Running an extremely busy store, all the time :) good job to Michael and the crew in the back who's names I do not know. Thank you!! Our pizza, wings, and bread sticks are always on point!  We always come to this location. Yes it's busy and there will be a wait but it's well worth it! You guys are great."}
{"text":"Never has any pizzas hot and ready. Isn't that there whole advertisement. I don't have time to wait 15 minutes. I would have went elsewhere"}
{"text":"Cheap pizza.  If you're lucky, you'll get what you paid for.  I'm feeling kind and giving this location two stars.  They rarely cover the pizza in cheese and toppings, but remember that the cheese and pepperoni pizzas are just $5.  When we have ordered the supreme ($8) the toppings are either burnt or look as though they have seen a few better days.  If you order the Supreme and they tell you it will be 5 minutes, be prepared to wait anywhere between 15-20.    Bottom line, if you're looking for a little more quality, try Papa John's, Domino's or Pizza Hut and pay a few dollars more."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Tonight we found hair and mold baked into our cheese pizza. I'm not talking a few hairs, but 7 different clumps, like somebody shaved into the cheese. Revolting and filthy. Would give no stars if possible!"}
{"text":"Assistant Manager Dustin is always helpful and the pizza always comes out awesome. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The $5 medium pizza is a deal. It's not loaded with toppings or anything, but it is fresh and good and a bargain at $5 every evening. You can get other pizzas like a Canadian (pep and mushrooms) for $7, too. The place is usually crawling with university kids looking for cheap grub, but everyone should take advantage of that deal. The hours for the deal are between 4 pm and 8 pm."}
{"text":"Best Little Caesar's in Mississauga/Oakville.  The pizza isn't great quality, but at $5-$9.50 a pizza you can't complain. They always have a variety of pizza's ready to go so you don't have to wait. It is definitely worth paying for the more expensive pizzas. They are only a few bucks more and are way more filling than pepperoni or cheese, especially if you're splitting it with someone.  My friend gets the veggie pizza even though it isn't \"Hot and Ready\". She also gets the crazy bread toppings on her pizza, Its really delicious but kind of greasy. The italian cheese bread is way better than the crazy bread and the wings are good too. They also usually have something free for kids, my sister got a temporary tattoo last time, she loved it."}
{"text":"These guys are great. They come out to my car so I don't have to leave my babies to run in. $5 dollar pizza in 10 seconds. Feeds our whole family. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"I made an online order. It said it was completed and ready to pick up. When I got there 5-10 minutes later they had sold some of my order and I had to wait for them to make more. The purpose of placing the order online was so I wouldn't have to wait. This location sucks!"}
{"text":"Got my order quick but was so dissapointed with what I payed for.  The pizzas had allot of sauce but no cheese and I ordered a sausage jalapeño pizza. It literally had like 5 pieces of sausage and 4 of jalapeño. After that I ordered Buffalo wings and received BBQ wings and the pizzas were cut so big I couldn't even share. So I had to cut them myself."}
{"text":"Always come to this Lil Caesars because of convenience. The younger staff at night have a bit of an attitude. But as far as $5 pizzas go.. Its fast, so that's all that matters.    You have to get an order of Italian cheese bread! It's the best item on the menu. Takes ten minutes to cook, so call ahead and they'll have it waiting for you."}
{"text":"I had read previous reviews from yelpers and took there advice and called 15 minutes prior to my arrival. When I got there, they still hadn't put the pizza in the oven. The lady told me it was going to be another 15 minutes. I'm still here waiting over 25 minutes.  I wish they would have told me that it was going to take an extra hour. The nine orders of people here are getting uptight about this.  I'm just seeing people walking in and out of this place. Watching people go somewhere else for there pizza. Where is the management of this establishment? Although this is a franchise, there should be some type of responsibility for the bad service they provide. The corporate office should investigate what kind of people are running this franchise.. It gives Little Skeezers a bad name."}
{"text":"If you wanna talk about a bunch of degenerates this is them. I asked for my wings to be naked and the sauce on the side, they told me they can't do that....They said they don't have anything to put the sauce in, ummm, pretty sure the marinara comes in a little cup on the side for the crazy bread (even offered to pay extra). Then I asked if the could put pepperoni on the Italian bread and AGAIN, they can't do that! Again I offered to pay for extra pepperoni.... These clowns need to learn CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! \"CAN'T \" shouldn't be in any food service employees vocabulary..... Ok, and to top it off my wife just got home with our food, they charged me for crazy bread and sauce but imagine this, we didn't get it!!!! I don't care about the 3 bucks, it's just the principal..... The management of this place needs to pull their head out of their ass and realize what the employees are doing or not doing!!!!"}
{"text":"I fully understand that we're talking about $5 pizza here, but when your whole advertising campaign is based on \"Hot-N-Ready\" - maybe you should have some pizzas that are actually hot and/or ready? After paying, they told me that it would be a 5-10 minute wait. After 15 minutes, I asked to speak to the manager - only to be rudely greeted by some guy that couldn't even be troubled to put down his cell phone - apparently he was in the middle of some text saga with his friend \"Pacho\" - I only know because he couldn't even be troubled to put down his phone while I was asking how much longer it was going to be. Ultimately, he walked away from me and said to his apparent manager, \"you need to deal with this fool!\" There was absolutely no effort to provide any sort of customer service or rectify the situation. Next time, I'll pay the extra $5 to go to Papa John's."}
{"text":"I called at 10:40 on Friday night and they were already closed!! Glad I called before wasting my time driving there.. I'll just go to horizon ridge & eastern location from now on"}
{"text":"No stars!!!! All I have to say is bad customers service and communication. I placed an order and they told me it would take 10 minutes come to find out the guy who took my order never told them to make my order. I waited 30 minutes before someone told me that they were very sorry. I finally got my order after waiting for 45 minutes!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was 42 minutes old when it was sold to me. The cheese was dried and darkened and the pizza was not hot at all. Very disappointing experience when you can't wait to eat after a long day. Normally this location is good, but they let this one slip through the cracks.   I am a former Little Caesars GM, so I understand how the markings on the box work. Each pizza has a 30 minute shelf time from the moment it comes out of the oven until it expires and needs to be thrown out. They are marked 30 minutes ahead of time so the crew knows when to trash it. My box was marked \"4\" which means it expires when the minute hand reaches the \"4\", or in this case at 8:20. My receipt has a transaction time of 8:32 so this pizza was 42 minutes old and expired by 12 minutes when it was sold.   I understand the want to not have a high nightly waste, and it sucks when you make too many pizzas and nobody buys them. But the answer is not to sell expired pizza to customers, all that will do make us not want to come back. Crew and assistant managers should be retrained on expiration procedures. This pizza was bad enough that I don't know if I'd go back."}
{"text":"the only reason I'm leaving a review is because the young man who took my order and gave me my food is the most polite worker I've ever encountered at a little ceasars haha.  This was last night around 1030. Kid deserves a raise. I don't typically eat pizza these days but someone else asked for it so I got it and was surprised by how great the service, speed and accuracy were. Great location."}
{"text":"The price is good for what you get and for the convenience (if it's ready). It's not anything to write home about but it's decent for $5. When the pizza is ready, it's nice to just come in and have it already done but I find the problem is at peak times, like dinner, the pizzas aren't ready. Umm...ok? I come at dinner time and it's a 15-20 min wait for a \"hot and ready\" pizza. I understand it's a busy time but shouldn't you take that into account and forecast how many you'll need when you are making pizzas for the peaks? Otherwise, stop calling it hot and ready when it's not! Kind of defeats the purpose of me coming to little Caesars versus a competitor. It's not like I pick this place over other pizza joints because it tastes better..."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok.good spot if u just wanna $5 quik pizza.the service n the waiting time hear is garbage thoo.never go at the hours of 5:00p.m-9:00p.m cause u will wait there for 35min for a hot-n-ready pizza"}
{"text":"The reason why I hate this place this because I went to order a pizza and they told me 10 minutes and i waited there for 40 minutes and they did not have my piZZA READY I WAITED FOR 40 minutes so that's why I dislike that I seen everyone else GETTING There piZZA before me when I ordered before them I think the staff is really unprofessional I think they should get fired I heard them talking but I didn't see him working on my pizza Little Caesars claims their pizzas are hot and ready when you are they should really change their name to not ready when you are"}
{"text":"Got my three pizzas, and realized after opening them when I got home that there was mold on my pizza. Disgusted. When I tried to call and tell them what I had found of course no one answered the phone. Will never go back! Gross!"}
{"text":"I visit this location fairly  regularly. A weekly basis. We go there after 4pm there are never any after 4 specials available. The pizza that is available (pep or plain cheese) is always inconsistent, sometimes it's cooked through, sometimes it's actually hot, sometimes there's a good amount of sauce and cheese, sometimes it's card board. Cheese bread/crazy bread, is an inconsistent quantity and quality,  size and doneness is always varied. The place is what it is, it's there it's somewhat convenient, it's somewhat cheap, you get a luck of a draw with what you get. If they cared it would be different, perhaps the  Place would be clean, a decent offering would come through."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give them one more chance, tonight still zero hot and ready pizzas and now the customers are stealing sauces when the cashier leaves the counter, which is more often than she's there."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a custom pizza. When I went to pick it up I left without checking it (rule 1 of basic pickup know-to). My husband had been working 48 hours straight and on the cranky side called and wasn't very nice to the young boy that picked up the phone (West I believe his name was). He was very nice and apologetic. As soon as my husband got off the phone I scolded him for being rude and he felt bad. I drove back to apologize. Instead of them being upset with me due to my husband they were extremely apologetic and very nice. West said not to worry about it and he completely understood. The young girl at the cash register was also very sorry. Everyone always seems very nice whenever I go there."}
{"text":"I was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today. I saw a sign for Little Caeser's & stopped inside. I got a large hot & ready pepperoni pizza with an order of crazy bread & dipping sauce for only $8. The pizza wasn't bad, I've definitely had worse. The crazy bread was awesome. I'd come here again for lunch if I was in a hurry & didn't want to spend much."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is slow i have to wait around 10-15 min at least. Bad place."}
{"text":"I went to the store and ordered 2 pizzas and cheese sticks. The store was busy and the order was a wait of 20 minutes. When they called me for my order, I checked my pizzas to see if they were correct. Opening 1 of the pizzas, the upper half of the pizza was smushed to the middle. I told the cashier and she replied \"Well, its going to be smushed in your stomach\" without even apologizing for the mishap. I left unhappy because it would be another 20 minute wait for the order to be done yet again. I called the manager and told her what her happen. She said she would \"comp\" the same order for me to return next time. When I returned, she only gave me 1 free pizza. Irate I was, she also given me a fake name of \"Kayla\" I was told no one works there."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! Craving a deep dish pizza and I can't get through on the phone lines, no one answers the phone! Last time I waited 30 minutes for a pizza when I walked in. I wanted to call ahead and see if I could put in an order for pick up. So disappointed, ridiculous not to answer the phones! Not sure if I will go here again."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  You don't go in expecting miracles, and they won't give you miracles.  It's cheap.  It's fast.  And it reheats well the next day.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Five people after me got their food before me. The two people behind us got a refund. She wouldn't even look my direction when I got my food, not even an apology. I waited 40 min for one pizza and crazy bread. If my kids weren't starving I would've demanded a refund and left. Plus the place was kinda gross. Never again will I go to this location, ever!"}
{"text":"There big marketing push is for the 'Hot & Ready' $5 pizza. Their pizzas are NEVER Ready. Every time that we have been in to get the pizzas we have to wait 5-10min. Go somewhere else! Pizza Hut or Papa Johns both have deals for not much more."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a pizza on behalf of a family member.  The expectation is for cheap and fast pizza.  It is inexpensive pizza -- $5.00 for a pepperoni pizza and $8.00 for a combination.  The expectation for fast comes from their Hot-n-Ready pizzas, which they make ahead of time and keep in warming ovens.  When I was there last evening, the fast part broke down a little because of how busy they were -- they had run out of their made-ahead pizzas.  Where it broke down as a whole was in boxing up a pasty-white under-cooked pizza.  Expecting good pizza from Little Caesars is expecting more than they can deliver.  Cooking it to their standards is expected, but something they didn't deliver on."}
{"text":"I recommend calling your order in ahead of time, otherwise you'll be waiting around their store for awhile. I ordered mine in-store and was quoted a 10 min wait time, which then ended up being 30 mins. It would've been even longer if I hadn't asked for the status, because they forgot to put my order in. This doesn't seem to be a unique occurrence, because the same thing happened to another customer while I was there!  I submitted a complaint to their corporate office, and never received a response. Apparently, their attitude towards customers goes all the way up the chain of command. This place is the Wal-Mart of pizza restaurants: their prices are pretty much the only thing about them that's better than other places. The customer service sucks, and the food is just mediocre--you get what you pay for! DiGiorno is usually cheaper, tastes better, and I don't have to deal with indifferent employees taking forever to make it."}
{"text":"Under new management. No more kids smoking on rocks lol. Seems a lot more professional, and the deep dish what?!?! Was amazing, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First off I know better than to order a special. I walked in  and in five minutes I was walking out with my hot and ready. The staff was attentive and courteous. I manager I assume because she was wearing a different uniform was working in the back when she got finished she walked up front to help. Good job"}
{"text":"No point calling your order in, they will always claim that you didn't. Get ready to wait even if you're the only one there, the employees are more interested into talking with each other than helping you."}
{"text":"5 dollar pizza is, well a 5 dollar pizza but not too bad. But the new deep dish pan is worth the few extra bucks and steps it up for the ready to go idea!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, the girl in front had no idea what she was doing. She had a break down. The manager if there was one on duty didn't even come up front to help her. Avoid if you can, slowest services and no aide when the front girl was struggling. I would give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"I frequent this place a lot. Most of the time the pizza is good. Usually fast service except for when there is a game, fight, special event on tv...then it seems to take forever! But hey, for the price, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"So let's be honest, Little Caesars is not the best pizza in the world but who would expect that of a $5 Hot n Ready pizza?  The pizza is decent especially for the price.  The only real complaint I have with this Little Caesars location is that I have been here twice to pick up a Hot n Ready sausage and cheese pizza and both times there were no sausage and cheese pizzas Hot n Ready...so, on the first visit my husband and I decided to wait as I'm not a big pepperoni fan and my husband is definitely a carnivore and needs some sort of meat on his pizza.  On the second visit I decided to just get pepperoni instead as I didn't feel like waiting for the sausage.  The pizza is of good quality for $5 but it would be nice if it were actually ready when we went to get it.  :)"}
{"text":"Today I got my pizza from Little Caesars I took my pizza and I went to the car I looked at my pizza it was gross it was brown and it was black all I could do is go back inside when I went back inside lady I showed the lady the lady said what was wrong with it I said could you not see that it's all old when she got mad and she did it and it took 20 minutes to make a new one I got so mad I am never going back to that horrible place I hate it"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PIZZA!!! I would give up my first born for a hot and ready and crazy bread!!"}
{"text":"How can you argue with a $5 meal? There's better pizza out there, but at 3 times the cost. Definitely the best bet for feeding a family. I've actually grown fond of their pizza. They have an online coupon that will get you free sauce your breadsticks. There's a wait about fifty percent of the time, but it doesn't last more than 3-5 minutes. Usually it's not because of the employees, it's because some dim-wit at the front of the line can't decide what they want to order...at a place that only has about six different things you can order."}
{"text":"This is my usual stop when I need a quick lunch or dinner for the kids. The staff is usually friendly......... not anymore. These kids look as though they could care less about their job. :-\"}
{"text":"I am really pleased with how they treat their costumers. They are always very kind and very friendly. However, i usually have to wait 10-15 minutes for my pizza which kind of defeats the purpose of \"Hot and Ready\". Overall they are very nice and i get pizza from here often."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Little Caesars location that I have been to that NEVER has pizzas ready. It is always about a 10-15 minute wait EVERYTIME for a pizza! They ALWAYS have a line, at least 10 customers waiting in the lobby against the walls, vending machines and blocking the doors! At first I thought, okay maybe they are super busy because it's lunch time. So I decided to give them another try, and another, and another, and then finally a last chance. Still...10-15 minute wait! Everytime!! Apparently this location doesn't understand \"Hot-N- Ready\"."}
{"text":"\"Caaaahhn i heilp yooOouu\" says the frog working the front. Yes, yes you can. I ordered a hot and ready and it wasn't even ready.. So I waited and watched the girl in the back run her fingers through her hair... Everybody was rude and hanging out in the front lobby looking at some dog.. How about you guys get to work and make some hot and ready pizzas so they can be hot and ready ?! I gave my pizza to a bum and kinda felt bad. Hope he doesn't get sick."}
{"text":"The dumb lady with the mole on her face fucked up our order. And then had the nerve to give us attitude. It's like \"B!tch it's not my job to make sure you do your job right.\" Haven't been back since and will not go back. Rude employees!"}
{"text":"Service is so bad, the quality of the pizza is irrelevant.  After finishing with the customer in front of me, the girl behind the counter asks \"how can I help you?\". I give my order, she turns to help another employee for a few minutes. When she's done with that, she asks me again and I give my order again. She takes my money, hands me my receipt and change stone-faced and tells me \"we'll call you when it's ready\".  10 minutes later, \"#031, your order's ready.\"  That's i  Not one single smile, not one single \"thank you\", not one single \"have a nice day\" to me or anyone else in that line.  (Quality of the pizza would have been the typical Little Caesars 4 stars, as if it matters)"}
{"text":"So, where do I begin? The fact that twice we couldn't get pizza because they were out of pizza boxes? Or that I called in a pretty big order for my daughter's birthday party next time and ended up being late to the party because even though I got there 15 min after the promise time I still had to wait 25 min for the pizza? Not only did I have to wait (after being promised on the phone that the order would be ready on time), the pizza was not fully cooked, we were shorted two pizzas, ( I know it's my fault for not double checking to make sure I have everything before we left, but I was already late to the party and trusted that they could get the order right), the bread sticks were soggy, no sauce that we paid for. And most importantly the people were rude! I can forgive the mistakes, but your attitude is what makes the experience and these people don't know what positive attitude is. I'm really sorry that I can't go back to this place since it's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the cashier my last visit. AL had the biggest smile, ready to serve with a warm and genuinely nice demeanor. He made it a wonderful experience and left me with a feeling of: We are definitely going back! Yes, they were busy, like they always are, but this young man is not affected by the pressure as he gives AWESOME customer service! Thanks AL, you made a difference! I hope mgt sees this and commends him. A great attitude is rare. :))"}
{"text":"We come to this location often. They rarely have hot n ready pizza ready for takeout (which defeats the purpose of hot n ready doesn't it?) the staff has never been really friendly, and on several occasions they only have one register open to help a line out the door of people (and there is ALWAYS a line). Their customer service is awful! The girls at the front would rather sit and flirt with future applicants who walk right in, instead of helping people who've been standing in line for 10 minutes. If you're going for more than a $5 pizza I recommend saving your time and money and going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty great pizza place for a super low price. Their hot and ready pizzas are a lifesaver after a long day at work. Stop in for 5 minutes and you have a fresh pizza to escort you to your couch and crazy bread that will tuck you in at night. You really can't buy better comfort food than that, and all for about $10.   Normally I wouldn't mention the staff in what amounts to a fast food restaurant, but the younger gentleman that works the cash about half the time is very quick and offers good tips when there are discounts to be had. Sometimes you can even get a free pizza when you buy a gift card."}
{"text":"went in for lunch special and instead of handing me one from the warmer they gave me a fresh one. they were friendly and my food was hot"}
{"text":"So much for hot and ready! Terrible service.  Went in for a Hawaiian and a Canadian plus 2 orders of crazy bread.  Nothing was ready.  Then they made a Hawaiian and a pepperoni.  I ended up just taking them as it was over 15 min wait.  Other people came in to and asked was was 'ready' and there was nothing.  The guy said there was only empty boxes is the warmer.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm disabled... I walk in and there's 20 ppl.. No biggie.. I tell the woman I'm handicap asks can't stand up and I'll wait outside, can She bring it..she didn't even listen to me and just agreed....   Nothing but bs.... Took forever.  My friend had to go in three different times, and was so aggravated he's now speeding down the road... Thanks little Caesar's.. Not coming to this one again...."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a decent pizza on the go. It gets pretty busy around lunchtime because of the two schools that are very close by so sometimes you have to wait. Around dinner time it's usually pretty good for having stuff ready to go sometimes you have to wait but it's usually not that long."}
{"text":"This place closed before 10:15 on a Friday night, listed until 11:00 on the door and online. The employees inside were sitting on buckets and looked at me laughed and mouthed the words were closed to me through the glass doors. Someone at this place needs to take control of their staff this was ridiculous"}
{"text":"The staff is always so nice, fast, & the pizza is consistently delicious!   I've been to other locations where the food is undercooked & they're rude but this one is luckily the one closest to home!"}
{"text":"If you want a pizza that's ready to pick up quickly this is not the place. Last 2 visits all I wanted was a pepperoni pizza and both times I was told a 15-20 minute wait. Hot and ready?????? Obviously not. Staff isn't the nicest either"}
{"text":"I love pizza. But I am crazy mad in love with Little Caesar's pizza. It's always a treat to order Little Caesar. Each time I order pizza here, it's an adventure. I recommend LC. Best pizza ever!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. They always take too long for one or two pizzas. All the time they say it'll take 15 minutes when they take even more than 20 minutes. Most of the time the pizza is burnt or its too salty. It's \"Hot n ' ready\" which is a lie. They have bad customer service and they always get my order wrong. They always have dirty floors. I would not recommend anyone to get pizza from this Little Caesars.   The pizza is good only once in a while. Its almost always burnt or cold. One thing I hate is that its never cut into equal pieces. I hate when the pepporoni is burnt or they have bumps in the pizza. I think they shouldn't take too long to make a burnt pizza. This place sucks and I don't recommend anyone going there."}
{"text":"It has fast service and low prices. I recommend the deep dish if you like bread or sauce. I recommend the regular if you like cheese. The crazy bread is delicious and so is the sauce."}
{"text":"This place sucks balls. The employees suck balls mostly. except for the ONE girl doing her job way in the back and making pizza by herself, as other employees were either on their phone or dancing, you go girl. The point of ordering a PICK UP order is to be able to walk in, pay and take it home, not listen to loud employees argue about football with each other and curse back and forth while they are in the middle of taking my order AGAIN since they obviously don't know how to take orders over a phone, and obviously don't know what customer service is since when I first called in the guy that answered kept saying \"I got chu\" after everything I said , very unprofessional ,No apology when I walked in either, I didn't even get a receipt or an estimated wait time, I gave up twenty minutes later after seeing about 5 other people walk out with their pizza that had walked in after me. Then tried to get convinced to wait a little longer because it was almost ready, HAHA yeah fucking right. This was the last time I will ever walk into this place. If the customer service was better and they were actually doing their jobs. I might have waited , but I'm not giving this location my time or money after this experience. And no stars I only put one because it wouldn't let me post without it :) good luck with this location ! It's a nice spot, too bad the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Manager was cool by correcting our order, but the cashier was very rude and the wait was just shy of an hour."}
{"text":"The pizza was hard and cold.  They substituted a cheese bread for a cheese pizza with out notice.  You get what you pay for... Discount pizza that is cardboard."}
{"text":"This store doesn't even deserve a star at all. The customer service is atrocious. After complaining to the head manager about it, they were still incredibly rude. I don't recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"I get it, you are paying minimum dollars for a pizza, so you get what you pay for, right?... the thing is - last year this place was great  - and the years before (we have 2 busy kids and come here to grab quick food more than we should). The pizza was good and they actually put cheese on it (crazy, I know!), it has obviously been taken over by people who are more concerned with overhead than quality. We drive out of our way to go to the Shawnessey location when the kids are begging for pizza and crazy bread and always get fresh, hot and covered in cheese as a pizza should be. I succumbed to going in to grab a couple of pizzas out of convenience the other day- knowing it would most likely be bad as it has been the several times before - but it was the worst. We got two pizzas barely with any cheese that appeared to have been there forever- far past its point of being called \"fresh\" and the \"stuffed Crust\" one was so thin, it was almost a tortilla (like c'mon - its crust!), and I'm pretty sure that whatever cheese was in the crust (and it was 90% air) had disappeared from the top. I sincerely hope the owners read this review and shape up. Please chuck the pizzas when they get old, put as much cheese on yours as all the other franchisees so people will get their pizzas for you and not the other guy 5 minutes down the road."}
{"text":"Hot N Ready! So I placed a phone order and the order was incorrect when I went to pick it up they said it would be a 5 minute wait, no problem. But when she gave me my order she gave me a free 2 liter soda for waiting. I didn't expect anything but was very happy. Who new great service could come from fast food?!"}
{"text":"The service is fast. The staff is friendly. The pizza is good for something fast. It's cheap and you get what you pay for...but do you guys always have to burn the pizza?"}
{"text":"NO BODY EAT HERE!!!  Let me tell you first i work in the restaurant industry as a Chef so i have alot of give and sympathy when it comes to mess ups and waiting for food.   However this was redicoulouse.  This little caesars is horrible! I ordered 1 order of crazy bread that is supposed to be hot and ready. Which they were not.. so I sat and waited. Bread can take no more that ten minutes I have time. I thought to myself. Fifteen minutes goes by and they serve about eight to ten people. Messed up orders or lost orders left and right there is no communication pertaining to the food or restaurant at all. They also lost a mans deep dish pepperoni. And another familys light sauce pizza. Obviously they are not ready for a rush because there was always a five minute wait on hot and ready pizzas.. At fifteen minutes I finally spoke to someone about my bread and the cook put an order in. And I watch it go thru and sit at the end of their conveyor for five to ten minutes while they talked and horsed around the kitchen doing nothing pretaining to their job. I finally got up and walked to the register and asked if I could talk to a manager and get my money back. Finally they say ooo they are up and almost ready.  The two cooks in the back are slow and have no idea what they are doing. I watched people touch their face or their phone and other things and I never once saw one employee wash their hands in the 25-30 minutes  I waited for my crazy bread. This place needs a new manager and new employees. The only bright light was the girl at the front taking orders Lindsey I belive. She took orders and was very kind to people. I even herd her remind the cooks of my crazy bread four or five times. If I were the manager this place would be way different.  HOT AND READY means the food is done when you arrive.. if I could give this place negative stars would be perfect!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Sunday, grateful i didnt have to cook. Many businesses are closed, rightfully, in observation of the Lord's Day. There was a young man taking an order from a Spanish speaking family, who ordered multiple pizzas, so it was a good sale. Nowadays, it is a good assett to have a bilingual employee. This young man was polite, courteous, and efficient. You never know how many customers will come in, not knowing any English."}
{"text":"That 'Combo Mambo' door chime is THE WORST!!!  I had to wait for a Deep Dish pizza at 5:05 pm wasn't this suppose to be Hot & ready??    The wait was fine but that damn door chime has caused me to HATE LITTLE CAESARS!!;!!  10 Minutes of BIte Bite sip sip I'll NEVER TOLERATE THIS AGAIN"}
{"text":"WOW! I should have read these reviews before walking in to this Little Caesars. Appearantly the people running this store don't give a crap about the nasty customer service at this location.  They lost a customer for sure. Never again"}
{"text":"Hot and ready is a lie! I was told up front that a supreme pizza would take 8-10 minutes. I said \"fine\". 10 minutes later, I was told it would be another 5-8 minutes. I promptly cancelled my order and took my business elsewhere. The staff appeared to be uncoordinated and incompetent."}
{"text":"This is the worst Little Caesars on the planet. There is never anything hot and ready. I was told today it would be ten minutes until my deep dish would be ready, 35 minutes later I'm still sitting here."}
{"text":"4 stars, for fast food pizza. Not even registered on the ny pizza scale."}
{"text":"I arrived at the store at 10:30 to order and pay for 18 pizzas.   I said I will be back at 12:15 to pick them up.   When I arrived to pick them up they weren't ready.   There were only a couple ready.  The lobby area got busy and the lady that was making pizza in the back came out and was giving pizza to people that just walked in.  I asked her what about my order and she said \"they only have 1 to pick up and she doesn't want them to wait\".  I got upset and questioned her more and she got irate.  She went in the back and was yelling about me and throwing things.   12:40 I finally had my pizza.   No excuse for service or behavior like that.  My order was large which is why I ordered and paid almost 2 hours early.   Seems no manager to supervise.  Very bad."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a \"hot and ready\" pepperoni pizza tonight. There is only one girl in the store who is making the pizza and running the cash register. Time wasted and disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"Shitiest little caesars in have ever been to when ordere 4 pizzas and they took 30 minutes they were taking so long bad service. Tupac for president!"}
{"text":"Hot and never ready no matter what time of day you come here you have to wait for a hot and ready pizza"}
{"text":"They don't answer their phone for phone orders! I called and it let it ring like 50 times and gave up. Poor service!"}
{"text":"Failed to tell me I would be waiting for my \"hot and READY\" pizza. I waited 10 minutes then had a guy walk in and order EXACTLY what I ordered and she handed it to him- he was in and out in less than one minute. I stepped up and said \"that is exactly what I ordered\" she responded with \"you're next\" and rolled her eyes. Then she looked at the other employee and told her I better watch myself. I work at a restaurant. I have been a server for 10 years as well as work a full time job- I am not trash and this is not how you treat paying customers. Figure. It. Out."}
{"text":"Hot n Almost Ready Little Ceasars, big wait If they had a free pizza for a wait it would be worth it, but there is not. Is that hard to cook a pizza."}
{"text":"The manager, who is also the person at the counter at the time, is seriously the biggest douche ever. So I walk in on a Thursday evening to find nobody there but me. Literally 0 business, and I can see why. I go up and order a fairly large order, and he just groaned. He would answer my questions in a very rude tone, and honestly made me wanna beat his ass. After placing my order he went over to his 14 year old employees and started talking shit about me and they would look over and laugh. While waiting for my food, I also noticed how much sass he would give to the customers while they players their order. And keep in mind, this dude is the manager. He also lied to me and said it'd take 30 minutes to try and scare me away. But I stayed for about 10, got my pizzas and dipped out never to return again. I can't stand when employees or even the manager thinks they are doing you a favor.. money talks and bullshit walks. Idk his name but I saw how you treat your customers and you are a piece of shit. You're probably gonna try and get this review taken down"}
{"text":"Just took back pizza . opened box when I got home a roach crawled out. It is now living under my friends oven. Totally disgustingly gross. Location is sahara and nellis."}
{"text":"Deep dish was pretty good  but the supreme was not so good... Had only a few ingredients... I've had it before and this one wasn't so good :("}
{"text":"For a second I thought I went to the wrong Little Caesar's after reading the reviews!  I went to this location for the first time on May 23rd, 2015 because we needed to feed four very hungry people very fast. We bought 3 Hot N' Ready pepperoni pizzas with bread sticks, marinara, and jalapeño sauce.   The shopping area that this restaurant is in is pretty empty and thus we got front row parking. I was surprised at how tiny it was inside, but that wasn't a big deal. The young woman was very friendly and took care of us as soon as we came in. They were out of a lot of the sauces, but they had the one I wanted to try so I can't complain. We did have to wait for about 5 minutes because they had to make two more pepperoni pizzas but it was very well conditioned inside and they had chairs for us to sit in.  The pizza and bread sticks were great! I'm picky when it comes to pizza and have never tried anything other than Dominoes or Pizza hut, so this was a very pleasant surprise. The sauces were also great.  Based on the other reviews, I think I may just try another location next time to try and avoid the kind of horrible things they had to go through. I'm just glad my experience was a happy one."}
{"text":"Pizza does not taste good. It is edible if your hungry enough but even five dollars is to much for this. It left me feeling sick for days as well. I think I will pass on this place."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! They see you walk in and don't acknowledge you and they are gossiping and took forever to take my order I was about to walk out and then took another ten just to get my pizza. So much for hot n ready If i could rate this place a ZERO i would!!!! Very unorganized."}
{"text":"Really hungry. No time. Stopped in and got the $5.00 Hot-N-Ready, or whatever they call their version of the no-wait, always-ready pizza. Staff was nice, very polite, offered three different types that were available (cheese, pepperoni, pretzel crust). I took the pepperoni pizza, then headed for home.  On arrival it was still hot. Their medium measured 13 3/4 inches across with an inch of crust around the outside. The pizza contained 27 slices of pepperoni. Pizza was baked until the cheese bubbled up and began getting brown, just the way I expect every pizza to be baked.  Now for the negatives: Cheese was plentiful but tasteless. Sauce was also kind of bland. The crust was thin but dense, not light and fluffy like fresh-risen crust should be. The only real flavor came from the pepperoni, which added a bit of spice.  Overall, I would say their pizza was bland, nothing special, but would be good if you are in a hurry and need something quick and easy without any wait."}
{"text":"The worst customer service. They never have their hot and ready pizza's readily available. Currently right now there is 12 people in line with 1 cashier open who spends most of his time buttering bread. Being from Detroit I can't imagine this is a corporate store. If you don't mind a 30-45 minute average wait for a hot and ready pizza this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Deep deep dish pizza is way too greasy. At over 300 calories for a small square it  Should not be sold to for human consumption.  Likely this is something that is populate is the US."}
{"text":"Came to get a deep dish to go. No deep dishes. Asked for any pepperoni pizza. No pepperoni pizza. This rude child runs up and asks if they have cheese pizza. No cheese pizzas. So tell me, humor me you dumb blonde at the counter what exactly IS in the boxes if you have neither one?!"}
{"text":"I'm not expecting a lot since it's a little ceasers, so I'll be generous with my review. The employees were really nice. Only downfall was that the pizza wasn't cut all the way through (we had to tear it apart and use a knife) and the pieces were super uneven. I'll probably be back If I want a quick cheap pizza that's close to home, but i won't go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"It's pretty sad when you walk into an establishment, see 5  people standing behind the register. But only one of them is doing any work. Mind you the lobby is full of people trying to get pizzas. And you want $15 an hour as fast food workers,a fucking joke you are"}
{"text":"Very sloooooooow service . Most dis functional little caesars i ever visited . Waited for \"hot n ready\" pizza for at least 25 mins . Employees looked like chickens with their heads cut off . Never visiting this location again ."}
{"text":"I looked for a new place to bring a pizza home for my family and found a Little Caesar's near by, with coupons! The coupon is on the website, also on the mobile device, for the \"Hot-N-Ready Crazy Combo $1.99.\" No where, NO WHERE on the coupon OR on the website does it say that you must print and present the coupon BY HAND to the cashier. So I brought it in on my phone, and guess what? I was told it can't be accepted because it wasn't printed out on a piece of paper. The young girl argued with me, even when I showed her the proof of what was on the website for THEIR store, and continued to tell me the coupon could not be accepted. Pizza Hut ALWAYS honors their coupons, and FIXES THEIR MISTAKES. THIS IS THE WORST PIZZA EXPERIENCE and I will not be coming back to this store. I am going to let everyone on Yelp know how terrible the customer service is, and how rude your employees are. They are better off getting a pizza from Domino's, who always has grumpy employees, and terrible food, than getting a cheap piece of junk from this Little Caesar's. I know, I got what I paid for--bad pizza and stupid people. That's definitely worth $5 and NO bread sticks."}
{"text":"Zero Stars for the wrong pizza and calling my family liars, we ordered a deep dish combo for $5. and a side crazy bread and extra cheese and mushrooms which cost $ 1.75 each, went home and no mushrooms, we called because of the cost of the mushrooms and the manager said she saw with her own eyes that we had mushrooms so we were lying about it and anyway she comped us the pepperoni! WHAT? If you saw the mushrooms than why did you comp us the pepperoni??  so we took the pizza back to show \"Ti\" there were no mushrooms but of course she wasn't there! And good thing because I really don't like being called a liar and will do whatever I have too to prove it! If you like good service, you shouldn't go there because it's severely lacking!!! This store needs to be trained in customer service to go with the pizza, Right now it's unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously... I get  that it's a great deal.. But the pizza is barely worth the $5 and when you call in to save time and they tell it will ready in 15, what the really mean is 45 minutes.  Every flipping time."}
{"text":"We had the \"hot-n-ready\" supreme and it was as advertised: hot and ready when we drove up. Onions were sweet and the meat toppings plentiful. Decent crust."}
{"text":"The pizzas are always ready on time. They have a special taste that my kids love. What I found out recently is that one topping is included in the $5.00 price!"}
{"text":"I just waited 30 minutes for a hot and ready. I had no warning that they were that behind. Very frustrating run to Little Cesar's."}
{"text":"Pizzas are always made fresh. And when I say fresh, I mean (THIS BOX IS HOT AS HELL FRESH!)   You get in, and you get out! Nothing better than that! I know this is dumb, but I came with a crazy idea that the next time I go I would time them on how fast they can get the transaction and pizza carry out done. LOL  OH and try the Deep Dish pizza! I know its about 3-4 bucks more, but its worth it if you can afford it. hahaha!"}
{"text":"What happen to Hot and Ready. I count 8 employees and everyone is so busy talking and not working that there are 6 customers all waiting on the same thing. Everyone is walking around with zero sense of urgency. The only person doing any real work is the girl at the counter and she's still very slow!! Where is the leadership!!??"}
{"text":"We had my kids birthday party at pony party time and we wanted to get pizza because it's fresh and ready but nope! My husband spent a hour waiting for our pizzas. We had to explain to our guest what was going on and the party ended up being a big disappointment. My husband missed the first hour of our two hour party. I hate y'all so much."}
{"text":"When it's time for a $5.00 Hot n' Ready pizza, this is where I go. Thrice, so far. I anticipate there will be more in the future. Never can tell.  I do not have a want to order anything special from here. Some of the things they have just look like the $5.00 pizza, but in a different arrangement of the pizza components. One time I did go in for a Hot n' Ready pizza and none were ready. I waited for it. Only for a few minutes. It was a \"fresh\" one when it got to my hands. Probably the best Hot n' Ready pizza I've had out of the three so far. Maybe I'll conduct another test of the pizza in the future."}
{"text":"One thing I've learned being a vegetarian/vegan, always check your food right when you get it before leaving to make sure they didn't put cheese on it. Have gotten pizza here many times and almost always get cheese on it when I ordered NO CHEESE. The price it great for the food quality but sometimes the workers don't care or pay attention or whatever and your order isn't right. Basically if you want good pizza go somewhere else but if you are low on funds and don't mind what is on your pizza then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"When my teeth sunk into that first slice of Hot Ready pizza, I new I had found something special. From the organic, fresh grated artesian Kroger cheese to the hand crafted crust, made from scratch daily, every bit of my pizza was flawless. Little Ceasers sources the finest local produce from Gilbert farms that use no pesticides. Eating at Little Ceasers is an experience that you will not regret and will not forget for some time. They create a magical pizza experience which you will remeber for a life time. Huhhh. Hmmm. yeahhh"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza and an awesome price.  Plus, it's ready really fast.   I haven't checked the nutrition info, but it doesn't seem as greasy as some brands, and it has a thinner crust so I think it would be a reasonable choice for those of us watching our calories."}
{"text":"The deep dish is way better than the hot and ready. Great customer service and great price."}
{"text":"Just because the $5 take-away pizza is waaaay better than it has any right to be, doesn't mean it is good per-se.   It just means that when you are heading to the beach at Lake B, or going for a mid-sunday mildly-drunken bike cruise, or coming home early in the evening from an old  friend's house who now only serves what they consider healthy snacks but what are really just various dry and bland baked chips and who's quit drinking and doesn't mind if you want to bring a beer but will never-the-less be silently judging you while you sort-of enjoy your Tankhouse Ale, you've got a quick, \"tastyish\" snack option that only makes you feel 3 stars dirty (as opposed to 2 stars or ugh, 1 star dirty)"}
{"text":"Slowest little Ceasers ever. Have been here many times and there is no such thing as hot and ready here. Always a wait and the workers don't know what's going on.  Just order from Marcos up the road. Way faster, tastes better and they know how to take your order"}
{"text":"Went to the store.  Had a rush of people come over. Asked to confirm how long t would take to get pizza ready.  10 minutes.  Guess who is still waiting 20 minutes later."}
{"text":"Very nice price for pizza. The cashier always looks messy though, not a very presentable person. Always has the $5 medium chesse/pepperoni's ready to go, but its not as heated as I'd like (gets a little cold before I get home).  I live only 3 minutes away, so I frequently get pizza from this location."}
{"text":"In terms of Little Caesars Pizza they do an okay job. The pizza is always severely under cooked and short on toppings but it is not inedible.   I would not go back to this location because of the owner. I have been in the shop when he has belittled and  patronized his staff creating an uncomfortable environment for everyone. The owner then goes out of his way to greet some returning customers and then completely ignores everyone else. This leads to a very unwelcoming atmosphere the occasional customer like me and since I am in a position to get my LCP fix from other locations I will go to a different one."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! I ended up leaving with no food and wasting my whole lunch break. They should considered hiring adults that actually want to work."}
{"text":"Always hot but Never ready. This is false advertising at its finest!! You should fix this issue before you get sued for false advertisement."}
{"text":"Eleven or twelve people on and they lost our order. How many people can run an oven. No management on or hiding. The were busy. I brought it to front three times. \"Just coming out of oven.\"  More training. Perhaps a facilitater to help flow but please fix problem when it happens. Sort of invested after 50 minutes."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Little Caesar's ever. They never have your pizza ready, even if you call ahead and order the hot and \"ready.\"  The pizzas are constantly burned or bubbled where there is a large area of the pizza where the dough raised in a bubble and consequent has no cheese or toppings in that area. I was told they can't control this and it just happens. Funny, when I get pizza from other locations or other pizza places they are able to give me bubble-free pizza.  The only reason we continue to go is that they are close and cheap. We've learned to never leave without checking for burned or bubbled pizza."}
{"text":"I know that $5.00 pizzas are a great deal. You get what you pay for. They taste horrible. I guess beggars cant be choosy."}
{"text":"Can't beat the a $5 hot and ready, however the quality is often times very inconsistent.  It's pretty much a crap shoot as to what you are going to get when going in there. Can't really complain though for the price."}
{"text":"I always have a good laugh at people, like one of the reviewers here, who writes, \"I checked the health inspection report (surrrre you did) and they have roaches.\"  Sorry to disappoint most of you, but if you've ever worked in a kitchen, you know the best ones do.  This isn't your house, where you cook a meal maybe once a day and, by the way, have no clue what's checking out your meals while you're asleep.    Life's nasty; get over it!  That said, I don't know whether this places has roaches, but they do have incredibly slow workers.  I guess, given what they most likely earn and the average age being, I don't know, 12, they really don't care a whole lot about jumping to your tune.  You think the majority of them are going to be here in 10 years ... or 5 .... or 1 ... or by the time I'm done writing this review?  Yeah, okay.  Little Caesars delivers exactly what they advertise:  no-frills, quick (sometimes) and hot pizza for less money than YOU would have to spend to make said pizza at home.  Even if you splurge, open your wallet and let those moths fly out, a pizza with the works isn't gonna be something special ... and you shouldn't expect it to be.  This is THE place to go when you've had a fight with your spouse and you need to grab a quick and hearty meal before cheating on him/her with the skank you met at the gym last night.  It's the place to go when mom and dad think you're at school after hours practicing for the play or playing basketball, but you want a pie, because mom can't cook to save her life.  Finally, when it's Friday night and there's nothing to do in Goodyear  --- I know, hard to believe, right? --- and you don't feel like cooking or even heating up another bowl of Ramen Noodles, this will hit the spot and won't cause a massive flight of Dollars out of your wallet.  So, get over the fact it ain't the cleanest, fanciest, fastest place in town.  If you spent some more time at home learning what the dials on your oven were for, you wouldn't need to be reading this review anyhow."}
{"text":"Little Caesars........please advise your staff, that if they are going to be rude and discriminatory to paying customers, they should not give those customer receipts with their frigging name on it. Yanary M, served us today, and her attitude was absolutely disgusting and customer service, piss poor. Your company will not be getting our money again."}
{"text":"I love pizza. This pizza goes easy on your wallet. If your looking to stay within the budget but cheat on your diet head here. I love not having to wait 30minutes since when I'm hungry, I'm hungry now not in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is bad. Place a call order. Was told it would be ready 10mins. When I got there the person act like I didn't call the right place. Was told again ten mins and the lobby was full of mad people. Notice everyone that came in was told 10mins. Not good! I waited 30mins for a 3 meat pizza."}
{"text":"I just called to order 2 pizzas the kid that answered was not professional.  His Customer Service over the phone is horrible."}
{"text":"Nothing hot or ready. Personally watched a guy wait about 15 minutes for a cheese pizza tonight. Can't tell if the staff is all stoned or just that oblivious. The girl taking the orders didn't get names, forgot what everyone wanted, and moved slower than I even thought possible. The manager looked angry that there were customers the whole time."}
{"text":"I think Little Cesars is the next best thing to chocolate milk...you cant beat drive thru pizza on a night to just chill..Now if they can do a drive through subway..that would be great!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Little Caesar's pizza we have had! On that note, one of the worst crowds of people my children and I have ever seen! IT'S A $5 PIZZA PEOPLE!!! my RANT: When you walk into a restaurant and there is 15 people ahead of you, you expect to wait. Same concept. If you walk in at dinner rush and order 5 pizzas, and there is 15 in front of you, IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE!!!! Calm down and quit yelling at the poor girl at the register (who hasn't even been to the back) about what's taking so long. They were rude and nasty to that girl in front of kids. IT'S A $5 PIZZA!!! END RANT.  On a better note: The pizza was awesome, cheesy and delicious. I highly recommend the pizza with the pretzel crust! Cheese sauce instead of pizza sauce, just delish!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!  There is no such thing as hot n ready at this place,  doesn't even matter what day of the week it is. Then we go in to get 3 extra most bestest pizzas and they had 2 ready and told us 5 minutes.  Why does some guy walk in and orders 3 extra most bestest and they hand him the pizza!?!?! What kind of $*** is that!?!?! It gets super busy at this location all the time,  you would think they would be prepared ahead of time but nooooooooooo"}
{"text":"These guys at this location have been saving my butt for years now. As a busy mom with kids ranging from infant to teens, I don't even always have the time to unload everyone to walk in and pick. Not a problem. I can't even count the times I've ordered and said, \"Hey guys, I have a sleeping baby in the car.\" They always say it's not a problem and have gone above and beyond to bring them to the car. They kindly comply with every crazy request I throw at them (like having all the pizzas double cut). From this tired mama of eight, thanks for reminding me that not all heroes wear capes."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. People are usually nice. If your looking for something quick to eat without having to cook. The $5 pizzas are worth it."}
{"text":"I will never return here. Went to grab pizzas on the go and the manager ruined my experience. She was rude and made me feel like we troubled her ordering pizzas."}
{"text":"Tried the new Pretzel Pizza this evening.  I called in my order so unwound not have to wait the 15 mins for a \"speciatly\" pizza. The person taking the order was friendly and repeated my order back to me. I had substituted jalapeños for the pepperoni slices that would have normally been topped.  When I arrived, my pizza was waiting for my pick up. I opened the box and I found it to be exactly as I ordered it.   I am only baffled as to why I was charged about $2 more for doing this.  After taking my first bite, I was content with it.  I was a little hesitant about a pretzel crust...but it works!  The pretzel pizza was hot and it tastes good... I would say even better than their $5 hot and ready pepperoni pizzas.  If you like the flavor of pretzels, you have to give this a try. You won't be disappointed. Pizza cost me $8.38"}
{"text":"It is worth an extra drive to avoid this place! The location was convenient so we tried again and again and again but it's always a terrible experience. The wait for \"hot n ready\" is always several minutes. The employees are highly untrained, and we learned the hard way to be pushy to get treated fairly because they're certainly not paying attention. Not worth it. We drive around to avoid this place and I recommend you do the same!"}
{"text":"Now that ceasars is making many different pizzas which is good, its operating like regular places where you must wait. Went to one on horizon ridge as always do after grocery shopping. Had one  employee taking orders at 3:30. Not one hot and ready pizza. When its busy, how can one person handle it. Couldn't wait. Other pizza places are cheap to now. With about six people waiting while nobodys making the pizza's, I might as well just go anywhere now.  They should always  have a manager there at least to help out. They should take out the hot and ready part in advertising. No longer true. I don't blame the employee either."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Went through the drive through today. Bought a \"hot and ready\" crazy bread. Opened it and there was a piece missing and a piece of hair on it!!!! Drove back through the drive through and gave it back. Was asked to wait for a new one. I then waited until another car pulled up behind me. They asked me to move forward. Served the car behind me and two other before bringing me out my food. Waited 20 minutes in the end for a supposedly drive through ready cheese bread. With no apology. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This use to be a decent pizza place. I ordered a mostest bestest pizza a couple weeks ago which had very little sauce on it so I called them and Debra the manager was very nice and took my phone number to receive a free pizza when I was ready. I went back today and got my free pizza and again it had very little sauce on it. I would go to Pizza Hut if I wanted a pizza without sauce on it. Little Caesars use to load up on the sauce. The obnoxious clerk at the counter is so rude. He has worked there for quite sometime now. He is so loud and has no customer service at all. I walked in today and he had his back to me washing his hands and yells out hello so loud that even his coworker told him he needed to take it down 5 notches. So it is not just me. He told his coworker that he did not need to take it down any. If this was my store I would never have someone of this caliber representing my company. There are a lot of good people out there that need a good job. I am totally done with this store."}
{"text":"They always have pies ready they're always friendly fast clean and this girl Rachel is working today was kicking butt"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. 2nd time I've come here and watched over 4 people who ordered after me get their so called \"hot and ready\" pizzas before me. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"The service I received from this Little Caesars had me thinking I was at the Four Seasons. Friendly staff, great service and most importantly - they made a situation right by going above and beyond anything they had to do."}
{"text":"I like the price of the five dollar pizzas! I think the place is full of hard working people like every other first job place! To be completely honest you get what you pay for so don't expect too much of the food."}
{"text":"This Little Caesars is cleaner than the other ones in the area. But the first time I order a pizza here they gave me the wrong one. The manager was apologetic over the phone and offered to replace the pizza. I was already home and didn't feel like driving back. I still come to this location but i check my pizza before i leave the parking lot. Hope this helps"}
{"text":"I absolutely hated my visit here they were mixing up all the orders and they given away the pizza that I ordered and had been waiting 38min or so to some guy who came in just like that and it wasn't even his order when I complained to the cashier why he gived it to people are comeing in barely and then she got all mad and started saying go back to Mexico (I'm not even from Mexico I'm from Chicago)she was like oh fine lady here's your FUCKING PIZZA then she opened my bread stick sauce and spit in it DISGUSTING i tried to tell the manger what she did and she OH HELL no get out of restaurant bitch my evidence is don't ever go here even if it's the end of the world it's just terrible"}
{"text":"I love Little Caesars, but this location is beyond ridiculous!! I went yesterday just to get breadsticks, and had to wait 15 minutes!! It was noon, and you have no breadsticks ready? The girl that works the front counter in the daytime acts like she is on something. When you cannot have pizzas ready at your peak time and that is your selling point, cheap pizzas that are hot and ready, than maybe you need new management and crew."}
{"text":"This location seems to always have the most perfect hot-and-ready pizzas. Even during a rush, the employees keep their cool and their smiles. This is my new favorite location of Little Caesars!"}
{"text":"I had a problem yesterday with my pizza because the dough wasn't cooked enough and the guy behind the counter named Jose was very rude, and when I asked for a refund he said once I buy a pizza and they recook it they couldn't refund me even though my second pizza wasn't cut through. I went back today and talked to the Manger named Monte and he was AMAZING he refunded me and gave me a free pizza but Jose tried starting an argument about the incident yesterday and wanted to say rudely that he didn't say we couldn't get a refund and walked away rolling his eyes and mumbling under his breathe. I would recommend to talk to Monte or another employee if you want an enjoyable visit at this Little Caesars because it's an amazing place just have one employee who must not like working with people."}
{"text":"I generally like to go to Little Caesars occasionally for a change up.   But you can guarantee I will NEVER go back to this location.   As I rule I'm not really fond of pizza with sauce that oozes all over the place so I tend to just order my pizza fresh and waiting versus, just taking what's available and pre made.     So a friend of mine and I went last night (2/26/17) to pick up a couple pizzas.  I ordered a pepperoni, mushroom and olive w/light sauce and a deep dish pepperoni w/light sauce.    Well the young lady at the register was extremely rude and informed me I would have to wait about 10-15 mins. and I said that was fine..... then she sighed and gave me a total.   My friend said it was like I somehow bothered her.   she ran my card and walked away from the register no words or pleasantries were exchanged.   So Whatever.  A few minutes later this young lady stopped working the register and went in back to prepare crazy bread/bread sticks.   Well we could see her clearly while waiting for our pizzas.    She had on no gloves and had not washed her hands and was now handling food.   I was so grossed out.   Then I kind of glanced back further where the other teens were handling dough, cutting and boxing pizzas.   Not one of them had on any type of plastic gloves.    Now I used to work for a restaurant in the Nevada area and I happen to know that NV health department is very strict.   So why all of these teens were preparing and touching food and not one of them had washed their hands or none of them had on any gloves while touching food, and they are still allowed to remain open and operating business???    This is disgusting and needless to say I could not eat my pizza after seeing all this and I surely will not go to this location again.    Shut this place down and teach these employees about cleanliness 101 and customer service ......    the depressed rude attitude does not belong in a customer service environment."}
{"text":"DO NOT VISIT THIS STORE! I waited in line... got the window, and asked what was available right away... the girl said that everything will take a few minutes. I paid and she asked me to pull around front... where I waited another 30 minutes! Unfortunately I had a screaming baby in the car and couldn't wait any longer... which is why I chose crappy little caeser's pizza to begin with... because EVERYTHING reads \"HOT & READY\". Nope. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Either you go in and there is no people and no Pizza or you go in and there is a million people with a long time to wait. There is no balance to this location. Went to Durango location and there was a ton of people and enough pizza. The only wait was being checked out. Trop and rainbow location needs to take notes."}
{"text":"This location is a joke even 3 years later since i wrote my first review, sign says hot and ready between 4-8 , blatant lies. Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service ever I waited in 35 minutes in the over heated building it was just over all terrible"}
{"text":"Horrid! The worst bread sticks I ever had from little caesars. We've been here before and it was great for this chain. The pizza has nearly no sauce in it and is dry/tasteless. Bummer it's not hard to follow the recipes these chains provide. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went in last night (around 6:30 pm) to try their new deep dish stuffed crust pizza. My DH doesn't care for deep dish normally, but for the stuffed crust he was willing to give it a try. It's supposed to be hot and ready, which it wasn't, but the guy to took my order said they were coming out of the oven shortly, so no big deal, I like my pizza hot as I live a few miles away. When he handed me my pizza, he specifically said \"stuffed crust\" of course when I got it home it was just the regular deep dish, no cheese in the crust at all. I didn't have time to drive back, besides, we were hungry, so we ate it, just the toppings for DH.   When I called today, the manager said he could give me a $2 refund, but to get another pizza I would have had to bring the original one back...it was \"policy.\" I've had many restaurants mess up my order (hello...McD's anyone!!) and they at least replace what they got wrong.   I understand mistakes, they were busy and things happen...but make it right when they do."}
{"text":"I went here and received great customer service. Everyone was friendly, greeted with smiles and although I only waited just 2 minutes for my pizza, they still apologized for a long wait. And the food was yummy! Thanks for opening in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I come here for the Crazy Bread, and soooometimes the pizza. But never for the wait. I've been here maybe three times since moving to the Northwest, each time there is an unbelievable wait time. This last visit, and possibly the last, I called ahead learning my lesson from the previous visits. They said 25-35 minutes, I arrived a few minutes early. When I went to pay, the cashier informed me that it would be ANOTHER 20-30 minutes. I asked what the point was of calling AHEAD of time if my order is still not ready, he apologized and said \"we got unexpectedly busy\". That's no excuse. It was a Saturday evening, it's hot, and people definitely don't want to cook so it should be expected that they will be busy. Especially since this seems to happen every. single. time. I go there. Maybe it's the employees or maybe it's just the location, but it is never a quick in and out when you go there.. so if you have an hour to kill and you aren't really that hungry just yet, go to this Little Caesars. Otherwise just get delivery."}
{"text":"Every time I step foot in this location they never have \"hot n ready\" pizza made, Not only that but there are a billion people in line already waiting on pizza. I don't understand what's going on but this place needs to retrain there employees starting from management down to cashiers. I guess from now on I'll just order my pizza from competitors.."}
{"text":"I can't really review this place like I want, because my cousin grabbed pizza here for the kids and i'm not a Little Caesar's fan.... I can say they picked a wonderful location and the pizza looked decent. I may go and try the bread sticks one day....just maybe:) I would give 5 stars but since I didn't eat the pizza i think four will suffice."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes when I got home pizza was all burnt . How can they serve this to there customers . In the garbage it went . Shame on them"}
{"text":"Oml I am done with this place. I order mushrooms on a pizza I go to bite in and guess what? Dirt still on it. Literally a clump. Took it back watched them wash the mushrooms cool all is good. Hope they learned a lesson. Next time we order mushrooms we get 9 parts not even whole slices and when I ask Abt it they argue and say that's the cup amt they use. Umm nope in a yr and 3 Mont's it's never been that amt. I paid 1.75 for not even 9 whole slices. Not to mention if the health Dept goes in they can see the pans don't get washed and that came from an employee there. Maybe if some of the employees were drug tested they could find the issue"}

{"text":"Fix your store, it is so poorly run that I cannot even go there. There are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!  Our neighborhood is not this gross but if I was from outside the area, I would think it's the slums. Totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. No excuses.  It also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards"}
{"text":"I grew up in a small town called Georgetown. We had a ton of pizza places including a Little Caesars. Little Caesars was cheap, but it was definitely not a great pizza place. Everyone who I talk to usually speaks of Little Caesars in a negative context.   Fast forward to 2015, it's been years since I've eaten their pizza . I recently moved into the area and decided to give Little Caesars another go. They've done a great job at advertising in the theatres and it really made me want to try it again. We decided to order one of their deep dish pizzas, medium pepperoni pizzas and their stuff crazy bread.  The medium pizza was delicious!! And the stuffed crazy bread as beyond amazing. The deep dish pizza tasted like a thick version of their normal pizza. Since giving this Little Caesars a go, I've gone back 3 times. Their pizza and crazy bread does not disappoint!!   I will say, like most chain restaurants, the quality varies by location (Georgetown's Little Caesars is still terrible). I'd recommend this location for sure!"}
{"text":"They deserve no stars I'm only giving them a star because I needed to write this but worse place ever the cashier Ezaria is extremely rude she greeted us disrespectfully. they take forever to get our food. She didn't give us the right amount of change and when we went up there to tell her she got an attitude with us and refused to give us our right change and then went on to the next customer and asked the customer of how she had given her change was right. Asking a customer if she can count right or not really? This place is tragic"}
{"text":"Worst customer service from the little girl who worked when I went in this afternoon around 4:15. She didn't make eye contact with me and she was rushing me and interrupted me while I was order to finish what I was saying. Customer service should always count, even in a small joint."}
{"text":"Poorly managed location with the worst service. I ordered two pepperoni pizzas at 5:20pm. The phone rang 10 times. I hung up and called back and someone picked up eventually.   I was told my pizzas would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Knowing this location is super slow I showed up 40 minutes after placing the order. They had no record of my order. There were customers in the store fighting because everyone had been waiting forever.   I finally got two pizzas an hour after placing my order. This place is a joke. Needs new management."}
{"text":"For $5 pizza there isn't much room for complaining. The employees at this location do often seem to be kinda out of it. However, this is my daughters favorite place to get pizza and I have to say it's not that bad.   It's no upscale affair, but it's a-ok for Friday night family movie night. :)"}
{"text":"They aren't prepared! NEVER! I've gone here several times and every time they have people complaining about how long they take and they don't rush what so ever. Worst location. How are you suppose to be Hot'N Ready but never have supply ???"}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to start.... this place drives me crazy!!! The people there are so rude, no common sense, and I honestly don't even think they listen to you when you order. This was the last straw, this place sucks. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Firstly, what is $14.08 from $20? Answer is $5.92. Cashier and Manager kept trying to give me $4 and some change from a 20 that I handed over. I argued with the cashier and asst mgr on a Friday night for about 5 minutes regarding this complicated mathematical figure. Secondly, I attempted to pre-order my pizzas and the phone rang and rang and went into a fax mode. No staff would answer. Thirdly, when I arrived, I was reassured that the \"Hot-N-Ready\" pizzas would be ready for me in 5 minutes, even though they are supposed to be on hand for walk in customers like me that cant through on the phone. Avoid this place like the plague unless you love to argue and get high blood pressure. This is my 3rd bad experience with this particular store. The staff are argumentative and have a bad attitude. You do NOT argue with the customer. Especially in front of 8 other customers waiting."}
{"text":"Basically I had a coupon and tried to use it, the manager thought I made the coupon myself. I told her to look at the cameras and I gave her the date and time to look at and it would show her the employee who gave me the coupon. She then told me the policy and procedures on how they do the coupons, like I need to know. It's not the customers fault that your employees did not follow your procedures, so stop treating your customers like we messed up."}
{"text":"Awesome clerk at the counter Adre welcomed everyone and was super friendly!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst service and worst pizza. My husband waited an hour for pizza and crazy bread, that was so saturated with sauce we couldn't even eat it. We won't ever come here again."}
{"text":"Never has pizza \"hot n ready\" unless you come at some obscure time.  Always have to wait.  Always appear to under staffed."}
{"text":"Crazy Good:  -$5 pizza that I had to wait approximately 0.2 seconds for. -friendly guy behind the counter.  Crazy Bad:  -the Crazy Bread. Ew! And Crazy Sauce. Eeek! Worst taste (and aftertaste) ever. Bread that turns to cardboard after only 5 minutes out of the bag. Sauce that's spicy-tangy without actually having any real flavor. Just imagine it. It's that bad. -the pizza was ok but the quality seemed to deteriorate the longer it cooled. Sometimes pizza is better at room temperature ... not this pizza.  Will I stoop this low again? Probably."}
{"text":"Worst service all the time....\"Hot and Ready\" NEVER! Always out of any type of \"Hot and Ready!\" 25 minute wait always...poor management staff and planning. 7 attempts to get a \"Hot and Ready\"..........fail....every time....if we have to wait why not sit at home and order a good pizza to be delivered...lost my families business!"}
{"text":"*popping the cherry*  Pros: Only $5.00. Addictive. Tastes great when you're stoned. The Italian Cheese Bread is kind of amazing. Convenient  Cons: Gets really old really fast. Addictive. 3 slices isn't filling so you eat 1 more and end up with a stomachache.   It's far from the best, but it's only $5.00, you can't really expect that much. And it's better than Dominoes, even after the change."}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice already and both times were terrible. The first time I approached the counter (this was during night hours by the way) a young black girl approached me with a I'm tired of being here attitude and asked me what I wanted. She didn't ring me up to pay or anything just walked away. So another customer came in after me and a young black male took his order and was very polite. The man ended up receiving his pizza before me as well. I asked the young man at the counter if he could ring me up because the girl prior to him didn't he said sure, of course. Without him approaching the counter my experience that night would have been really bad. Now tonight I went there yet again during night hours and the same young lady approached me with the same attitude. It's her entire demeanor that makes me confident that I will not be going to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Well like most of all the reviews say you have to wait a long time in this location, as if they don't know that they have a rush every single day, which makes sense to make a lot of pizzas right? Anyways I normally go to this place because it's close to home but this time the wait was terrible and then when my order was called I was so happy that I just got my box and walked out, low and  behold while I was in my car waiting in traffic I noticed that my pizza box was smashed in one corner and I had a huge rip in it as well, then I noticed that it had breadcrumbs as if like breadcrumbs from chicken was all over it, I did not feel happy about it, and I did not have time to turn around and go back in and with the sad faces that were working there, so I did report this to the little Caesars listens.com website and took pictures, look at these pictures what would they say if you brought home a pizza box like this to your kids, what would your spouse say, they will think that I beat up this box on purpose, but really it came literally from the pizza maker, to the server, to the cashier, REALLY? It exchange three hands before it got to me and not one of them had the audacity to switch out the box or even apologize for that matter, this is the last time I go in this hot humid store and look at the sad faces there, I'm going to Pizza Hut or dominoes because they always deliver on time and always happy to see me and greet me, my business is going elsewhere!  Don't hold back and report this especially if you're eating there. Let's make them raise their standards!!!"}
{"text":"This location is very busy. Don't understand why no reviews yet??? Anyhow. This store is hit or miss. Pizza is always good, however sometimes the cheese is lacking.  We only ever order the deep dish....and recently we got the new stuffed crust deep dish.  In my opinion, it's just OK. But I am kinda a snob.  I feel like the cheese or cheese-like product they use is very very cheap.  It reminded me of Angie's Pizza in Barberton.....flavorless and a weird texture.  I'm sure other folks will enjoy it.  I doubt I will get that specific Pizza again and will just stick with the original deep dish pepperoni. ... But that's just me.  The guys are always very nice when ordering and picking up.   :))"}
{"text":"Extra Most Bestest pepperoni pizza. Being a \"Hot & ready\", the crust was a little tough. The first thing you notice is the cut. 2 very small pieces, 4 very large. It's well covered with paper thin slices of pepperoni. I don't know Where they put the extra cheese, it wasn't on my  pizza. I loved the sauce. All in all, for $6.50 it wasn't a bad pizza. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Why would I come into ur place of business to get a stop n go pizza if every time I come here it takes 10-15 minutes to get a pizza they're supposed to have ready at all times. Totally ridiculous and false advertising. C'mon little caesars you can do better than that."}
{"text":"Just the same as always but this time we got the square pizza! MMMMM corners!"}
{"text":"This place is getting ran by kids !! Omg the cook (guy with curly hair ) not wearing a hair net is messing up orders disrespecting yelling at the cashier in front of us they are crazy going at it like its cool!!!  The Place is trashed!!!  Is cool that they are working but they need an adult  manager which clearly there is none!!  However the cashier girl is very sociable and has customer service  and makes up for it but Waoo...."}
{"text":"WORST WORST WORST ever pizza preparedness.  They have a nation wide campaign that says Hot & READY!  They are NEVER NEVER NEVER READY!!!  I have stopped a number of times & they NEVER have anything ready, always using same excuse-- \"we just had a rush.\"  Worst managers ever!  Wish I could do minus stars."}
{"text":"A month ago I called and placed an order for 7 hot n ready pizzas for my son's birthday. I told the girl the time I needed them, how I wanted them cut, and how many pepperoni and how many cheese. I had a friend go and pick them up for me. She had to wait over 30 minutes and then called to double check what I ordered. She said they were one pizza short. While on the phone with me I heard her tell the girl she wanted another cheese pizza. When my friend gets to the party, none of the pizzas were cut like I asked them to be. And that last cheese pizza I heard my friend order, was a pepperoni. I called the next day and talk to a girl who said she was the manager. I told her what happened and she offered to give me my money back if I brought in my receipt.  I go in the next day and I talk to a gentleman who says he is a general manager or something. I explained to him what happened, I told him the time and day I called and spoke to the \"manager\" (I didn't get her name). And that she said she would return my money. He starts saying that he only had a manager in training there that day and basically gives me the run around on the situation.  He tells that I just need to call the corporate office. I go online and send an email and still no one has gotten back to me to apologize or anything about the issue. Smh I won't be returning back there. Smh"}
{"text":"Probably the best Little Caesar's in the Valley. I drive 15 minutes out of my way just to come to this location even though there is one right by my house. This one has a drive thru, way better service and their pizza is always fresh. Can't beat a large pepperoni pizza for $5. The supreme is pretty tasty too. Will be coming here from now on."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very fast, and tasty. Love this place. Man running the counter today, especially, seemed to have a nice, positive attitude.  When you're looking for a cheap pizza that you can just come in and devour, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Avoid this location at all costs, there \"hot n ready\" is NEVER ready. It's always a 10minute wait every time I go in there. The $5 Lunch combo is NEVER ready either it's ridiculous! Especially for people on there lunch breaks or trying to find a quick bite. As advertised hot n ready pizzas suppose to be ready at anytime and it never is, every time I've gone in there people are walking out with discuss .. AVOID"}
{"text":"They try really hard, but seems like this store is overwhelmed very easily. As soon as four or more people are in the store the whole place falls apart and your waiting time instantly doubles. If they do get your order right it'll be good because yes, they do make good food there, but I've seen orders go to the wrong people, so double check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"This is a well oiled machine. My family does not eat like this but a couple times a year. It's a real cheesy pepperoni treat. I sat for about 5 min and waited for my special order. The time was 6:30 pm on a Thursday. I watched the employees make pizza, take orders, phone calls, communicate to each other. I thought they did a great job!"}
{"text":"Great price for a quick dinner. Most times they have everything ready. Prices have increased a little over the last year or so, but can't beat 6$ for a pizza"}
{"text":"If there is one location in las Vegas that never has a \"hot n ready\" pizza actually ready it is THIS location. Expect to wait minimum 10-20 minutes for a pizza here EVERY single time. I live nearby and have to come here often because it's the closest and it never fails, I ALWAYS have to wait and the pizza is NEVER \"hot n ready\"."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! The cashier was talking and texting while being on the register and took her sweet time to help the other cashier that was actually doing her job! I placed my order over the phone when I walked in there were 3 people in line including myself it took me literally 20 min to walk out the store and not to mention my order was ready! Slowest service ever!!"}
{"text":"Only lil ceas i go to! Others just dont know how to cook a pizza! This location mever burns or messes up the order bad... might forget to give you crushed pepper but thats it..     Hot n readys are always hot n ready no wait unless u order 20 large pizzas witch i only waited 10 mins when i did that for my kids school!     All n all i will continue to order from here when i need food in need to be home in 10 mins flat"}
{"text":"Did an online order and had the code to pick up our pizza... this is probably the 4th that have walked in there with the employees... a bunch of kids being obnoxiously inappropriate and acting like complete fools.  Also having a pizza that has been cut like a 4 year old!   Come one now it's not that hard to cut a pizza."}
{"text":"No issue with the food. The service however was?extremely lacking. 5 people in the place but only one kid making the orders one at a time. Nothing was \"hot & ready\" I even called to order a deep dish pepperoni ahead of time. 8 minutes should be ready. 10 minutes later I arrive and still had to wait 10 more minutes. Not unhappy with the food just the slow service. Hope they can find a way to keep more product available and speed up the pace."}
{"text":"This is the worst Little Caesars I have ever been too! Whenever I go in, the teenagers running the place are rude and ignore folks. They do not greet you and take people out of turn. Then the \"hot and ready\" pizza are never ready! I end up waiting every time. When we get our pizza there are bubbles in the pizza all over the place! Bread sticks are either black or cold. Seriously NEVER going to this location again!!!  The LC up then street off of 43rd near Target is where I will go. They treat folks right and are respectful and deliver on the brand!"}
{"text":"I understand pizzas are only $5 which is great but no cashier. Had to wait for someone to decide to come up and then they don't even have pizza ready. It's noon. It's lunch time and should have as advertised hot and READY. 10 min wait on pizza."}
{"text":"This is good pizza when you consider the price and that it is meant to be for quick pick up. Let's not bother comparing it to other pizza places, because that wouldn't be fair. You'll never beat the price for a pizza like this."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service by the Manager. The young lady behind the counter was lovely. I ordered and paid for my pizza and sat down in the seating area to wait for my Paratransit mobility ride as I have a prosthetic leg. I was sitting for no more than 5 minutes and the manager advised I can't sit there and I must leave the restaurant. Keep in mind there was NOONE in the store, no one in line, not in the way at all. I asked him why and he said, \"we don't have a public bathroom?\" Huh? I never asked to use a bathroom nor was I in the way? Horrible! I had to wait outside in the hot sun with a prosthetic leg and limited mobility. Is that how Little Cesar's treats their customers? Especially people with mobility issues or disabilities? Tragic. Might want to retrain your Managers. Maybe some compassion training? I was in the store 4/11 at 1pm, the Manager had dark hair."}
{"text":"Hot n Ready liars! I asked them BEFORE I bought it if they had a pepperoni pizza ready and they said yes. Took my money, but didn't give me my pizza. They proceeded to take the next persons order. Um excuse me, can you grab my box of pizza right behind you? They proceed to tell me they have none and that there's a 20 minute wait. I demanded my money back, drove to a different location and had pizza. Took less than 10 minutes to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Walked in around 9pm, asked which pizzas were ready, was told a pepperoni. I said great I'll take it, the lady glanced at it, thought for a moment, then sold it to me. When I got home I looked at it, it was the oldest, driest, most shriveled pizza I have ever paid money for. I'm going back tomorrow to get a refund. Better quality assurance next time, okay? If you have to give something a second glance it's probably not okay to sell."}
{"text":"Disappointed they don't sell the Meatsa pizza here. Thought they had this choice at all of them. I was so very disappointed"}
{"text":"This location is horrible for service! They have messed up my orders a number of times and then today I called to order 2 crazy breads and they tell me it's a 35 minute wait?!! What happened to hot and ready?! And the guy who answered said oh we have an over load of people in our lobby so you have to wait?! They should be prepared on a Friday night at 6pm!"}
{"text":"The guy working tonight is hilarious! Definitely woke me up with great humor after a long work day! Just an FYI...this location is located behind smith's not near chase."}
{"text":"I love how made to perfection this place makes pizza and cheese bread! Their cheese amounts are perfect and drizzle...."}
{"text":"So, we ordered 6 pizzas tonight for my son's b-day party. They got 2 pizzas wrong. We went back to complain and got attitude from them and no apologies. Are we ever going back? Nope."}
{"text":"35 mins for one pizza. Hot and ready it is not. Then they messed up my order. This is pretty much the worst Little Ceasars ever but the only one that is close."}
{"text":"Love it! We always go there for fast drive through service! Only 5 bucks! Awesome! Large pepperoni pizza"}
{"text":"Always forget this place is still around since those commercials aren't on!  Stopped in and picked up a couple of pizzas and wings. Employees are friendly, and was in and out in less than 10 minutes.  Price is awesome.    Wings were a bit spicier than expected, but didn't really ask about it so that's on me.    Great last minute decision for dinner."}
{"text":"Never again. I came in not too long ago for 3 cheese pizzas. Easy right? Isabelle is the one who helped us. She could never get the order right. I don't get it. Why is it so hard to understand something so simple. So we get a wrong order. So we try again. This time she says all is good. She refused to give us a receipt but I didn't mind. So we end up waiting for a total of 38 minutes. That is unacceptable. You have 3 workers back there. What the heck are you guys doing, smoking weed?  So we finally get our order. 6 pizzas, 2 extra breads. What the literal heck. Tried to return the pizzas and she said she cannot return them. This is the absolute worse customer service. $25 more than what I was expecting. So I hope the manager reads this. Don't fire this person, but just let them know this is why they work here and they always will. I will not go to this pizza place anymore."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected and was a little underwhlemed by the breadsticks. Pizza was ready and waiting though when we went in around 5pm to pick one up."}
{"text":"Strangely I actually enjoy this pizza cuz it's cheap, fast, and tastes pretty good. I stopped at this one cuz it's on the way home from work and ordered a 3 meat treat pizza. They do No justice with this cuz there's no exactly a lot of the 3 meats on it but it does the job for me. She told me upfront the wait will be about 12 minutes so I hung out a little bit.   Service was okay but like all the others it's small in the lobby and plenty of people wanting fast hot pizza. My pizza was fresh, hot, and perfect just like I like it. Couldn't wait to get home to devour 2 or 3 slices and it didn't disappoint. And of course I have some left over for lunch.   Nothing major here, no frills, just my input since I've never been to this location. If I feel the need I probably will be back again."}
{"text":"Well I wasn't feeling to good today& only wanted to eat, come home take a shower, and go to bed. Since I was tired of burgers & fries I decided to stop here.   I walked in and was immediately greeted. Three cashier was very pleasant and made eye contact with me. I think they're trying to conserve energy cuz it appears they air wasn't blowing to full capacity. With it being hot, the ovens going, & bodies, they need to ramp up the air a bit.   Well I ordered the 3 meat treat and I had to wait about 10 minutes for them to make it. Well it was good as expected as I sometimes actually enjoy this place when I'm in that \"I DON'T CARE\" mood. It did what it was supposed to do which was fill my belly and some leftover for lunch tomorrow.  So I gave an extra star for the great customer service the young lady had given me."}
{"text":"Do not got here! Poorly managed. Lie about times. Hot n Ready is a lie. Manager lies. Lied about not able to receive a receipt. Get it? Lies!!! An hour plus although they kept saying 10-15 minutes the entire time. And so shady not to give a receipt because they know they were horrible and didnt want complaints. Absolutely horrible! I bet you they don't even have anyone monitoring customer complaints because they know how horrible they are! Trust me corporate will know about this horribly managed franchisee!"}
{"text":"***Update*** SURPRISE SURPRISE!!!! I come in to grab a couple pizzas for a sleep over. And guess what!?!  Nothing is ready!  And I wasn't told that nothing was ready until after I paid!!  It doesn't mater the time of day I come nothing is ever ready!!!!  Seriously every single time I go here there is always a line & nothing is hot & ready.  But I continue to try because it's supposed to be quick & easy & is a treat for my son. Today we walk up, I see its crowded, open the door, hear another customer say \"just give me my money back I'm done with you guys\" I turned around & walked back to my car."}
{"text":"Was owed a pizza tried to collect a month later because I have a big family I don't go out to eat all the time due to my budget. With that said,I called up first asking if I could get my pizza that they messed up a month ago. They said it's past due and can't get my simple 5 buck pizza that was owed to me.  I hung up and thought to myself well I'm going to yelp that place. Well I called back and the manager Chris or Christopher wouldn't give me his name over the phone so I had to personally go in and get it. I was pissed and frustrated because I'm a paying customer who just wanted my pizza that I was owed felt disrespected over the phone so I gave him a piece of my mind when I got in there.  But the kid looked like he was 18. Man I'll never go to that place again. Enough said."}
{"text":"This location has always been good to our family. We have had complications from time to time dealing with the staff in the back but the gentleman or gentleman in the front always seem to be very kind and courteous and helpful in anyway that they can be (though I have long missed one of the former staff that worked there who was a delight to see, talk to, every time we visited and she made each trip in a personal greeting or something). The chief problem I have encountered has been with service in the back. Orders made wrong, or sometimes a pizza not being included in the order at all. I understand the specialty is a certain type of pizza ready at almost all times for five dollars. Typically I would rate any type of service industry like this that is very thankless at times pretty high because there's just little respect to go with it. Today, whom ever answered my call, was completely rude, made me feel like an idiot for trying distinguish my order from one of their specialties.  From now on I'll order my special pizzas somewhere else and go to them for just the quick plain."}
{"text":"Should give them zero stars.  Service sucks and pizza blows.    10 people working aimlessly on one pizza at a time type of shop.      How many people does it take to change a light bulb? The whole little caesars staff"}
{"text":"There is no 'hot and never ready' always have to wait 30 minutes or more!!! Don't why it's called hot and ready lol"}
{"text":"Lmao guess I didn't need to leave a review I just should have checked Yelp first. Now I'm glad they didn't have any \"hot and ready\" pizzas. Stopped in to grab a pizza real quick and they had a 15min wait one. No cheese or pepperoni. Gotta step your game up guys, Quick pizza is what you're supposed to be all about. The store could use a good cleaning inside and out too. I didn't really want to grab the handle when I came in"}
{"text":"Hot and ready is not happening got here at 1:30 it's now 1:58p. And no pizza ready and it's just one of the hot ready pepperoni"}
{"text":"The pizza was cut wrong! The wings takes nasty! I would never come back! Poor service and bad food!"}
{"text":"Flavor/spice on pizza was off.  Next time - said it was 45 minute wait for the \"Hot and Ready\" pizza. I asked why it was called Hot and Ready, he said you have to order in advance. I asked for a district manager's number and he looked like he wanted to fight me.  Bad location."}
{"text":"Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line...it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street...  Save your self some time and aggravation...just take your money elsewhere..."}
{"text":"High volume place so be prepared to be looked over for the guys standing next to you. Doesn't bother me a bit because the employees are doing the best they can to go through everyone. Lets face it, employees aren't paid to well, food isn't gourmet...what do you want? You want a quick hot pizza, this is a great place. Usually allot of people waiting in the lobby but I am always able to get in and out in less than 10 minutes. No complaints, can get a little crowded though especially on the weekend and Friday nights."}
{"text":"Hot and ready was awesome and yum yum clean and friendly ppl always luv me sum little ceasers"}
{"text":"No napkins, must have exact change to place an order and the wing were particularly raw!!! HORRIBLE!!!! So many customers were turned away because they had $20."}
{"text":"I came for the hot-n-ready pepperoni pizza. There isn't much more to say. You get what you pay for and it's a $5 pizza. So there isn't much to expect. The service was quick since the pizza was sitting in a box in the heater.   The store was pretty small and could be a little more cleaner. I'm glad this location is near the UNLV campus for whoever's ballin' on a college student budget this would be your reality lunch or dinner.   Although I'd have to say that this Little Caesar's is kinda sketchy especially at night. Whenever I go when it's dark, I always see random bums asking for money or on the sidewalk near the entrance. So just be cautious.   The pizza can be pepperoni or cheese, whichever you like. They usually have both flavors available till 10pm. The quality? Well let's just say you and I could have better but are willing to accept it because it's only $5! Lol"}
{"text":"It's okay. Very inconsistent with the amount of pizza sauce they put on. Sometimes it's over powering, most times there is hardly any which makes pizza dry...never can walk out of there with an order \"just right\".   But what do you expect for cheap. You get what you pay."}
{"text":"This has been our go to little Caesars for years now.  Was very disappointed to find out they don't sell the thin crust pizzas at this location. The thin crust is super good!"}
{"text":"Deep Deep Dish Pepperoni pizza is not deep at all. The dough part is so thick so it appears to be a deep dish, but it is not. It's just extra thick pizza."}
{"text":"Service is slower in this one compared to others! Hot & Ready's are NOT always hot and ready! You usually have to wait at this location no matter what. If your order comes up the pizza is cooked ok, and is what youd expect..."}
{"text":"They always have a pepperoni Hot & Ready! Sometimes they are burnt though, so make sure you check out your pizza before you leave!"}
{"text":"I normally would not go to Little Caesars for pizza, but we had a giftcard to use and I decided to stop by here for Lunch on Monday.  I ordered a pizza and gave them the giftcard.  The staff had no idea how to charge with a giftcard.  They apparently got a new system the other day, but LC corporation failed to communicate and train their staff.  I was handed my pizza while they still talked about how to make the giftcard work.  They called someone to ask and were supposed to get a call back.  They didn't tell the person on the other side of the call that they had someone waiting because they never called back while I was waiting.  I waited as they still griped about the new system.  One of the guys eventually said hey, how are we going to help this lady, she had been standing here and waiting.  And the lady says, I'm waiting on the call back.  I asked if I could just get money in exchange for the giftcard and pay with that, she was not willing to do that.  Okay, well do something instead of just griping.    I eventually asked for my card back, gave them their pizza back, and walked out.  I don't get how you even let something like that happen.  Should have just allowed me to take the pizza and be on my way while they figure out their screw up with the new system.  Anyone want a giftcard?!  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of little caesars until today.  I called in a order for a pretzel pizza with marinera sauce (no cheese sauce). I get a rude answer back with \"we don't do that\". As I proceeded to tell the girl on the phone I have had it done several times she proceeded to tell me \"no we dont\". I have never been treated with such disrespect. I asked to speak to someone else and she told me that she is the general manager. As a general manager you DO NOT tell a customer they are wrong. You politely explain the policy with the company and apologize and maybe suggest them something else. I asked for her supervisors name and number and with a condescending voice she said \"I can give her your fax\". After going back and forth I took the number and hung up. This happened between 5:15 pm and 5:30 pm on November 26 2014. My boyfriend went in after I told him I couldn't order it and they gave him the order with no cheese and extra marinera!!!!! That store is ran by a joke of a general manager. If I could give a negative rating on customer service I would.  I'm very very disappointed with the major lack of customer service there. I hope things get better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both got very sick after eating pizza from here . We haven't been back since , cheap pizza but not worth the risk of getting sick ."}
{"text":"On Thursday night I had ordered a pizza with crazy crust all over the pizza. It was quite busy so I knew there would be a wait but I didn't think it would be a 20 min wait. Not only did I have to wait an absurd amount of time, but they drenched my pizza in butter. I couldn't wait for a new one being that I had tickets to see a movie so I went home and called the place and let them know about the pizza. They told me they would comp me a new pizza when I came in next time. I went in there today and it was even more busy. After waiting in line, explaining about my comped pizza to the cashier and then receiving my pizza, it took 30 minutes for all that. Then I explained to the guy that I want crazy crust on the pizza but not a shit ton of butter like it had last time (same guy who did it Thursday) and guess what...I opened it up right then and there and it was drenched in butter again. I didn't make a big deal about it, all I said is I don't understand why you guys can't get this right. I don't think anyone cared to hear me being that there were about 15 people in this small ass store waiting to get pizza so I just left. Nobody was rude but just very unorganized and ran by a bunch of kids. If you want good quality food and promptly, I suggest you go to a different location."}
{"text":"This is an update, I got a pizza here the other day and it was well cooked.  The staff was friendly enough, although I didn't see anyone wash their hands, which I am a stickler about.  Much better pizza than a couple years ago!"}
{"text":"No adult supervision at all! They all work on slow speed and really don't care if you wait 30 minutes for the pizza they said would only take 8 minutes to make. Watch out what they charge you for, the girl added something to our bill."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a 0 rating I would! This past Saturday we called an hour an a half in advance to have 10 pizzas ready for a birthday party. We asked for them to be ready for 11:45am. I realized I was going running about 10 minutes behind so I called and let the girl know I was still on my way I was just about 10 minutes away, and to please do not give out my order. She said ok thanks for letting her know. Once I get there, they FIRST tried to tell me that there was no order under the name I had given them, THEN they try to tell me that someone called and cancelled the order so they gave my pizzas away! ! I told them the words \"cancel my order\" never came out of my mouth., I had called to tell them to NOT to give out my pizzas because I was on my way I wss just late! After arguing with these girls who clearly don't know how to do their simple jobs, the manager comes up and ask whats going on. I tell him exactly what happened and he rudely asks how that's his problem!?! How is it not his problem that his employees f*cked up and know they did and now I'd have to wait who knows how long for these 10 pizzas?! Then he says all he needs to know is if I'm going to re place the order or not. Having no time to go anywhere else I did and asked if I could at least have 1 free pizza for the inconvenience, he again rudely says no I have to pay full price. So then I ask him to write down his name, number and store number because I will be calling corporate to speak to someone how rude and unprofessional this man was. Usually I don't go out of my way to write this long or rude of a review but I am just astonished at how terrible this location is!!"}
{"text":"The last time I had Little Caesars was back in 1996 or so when I was living in Lanexa, Virginia I remember going to Little Caesars and the Pizza was good but not any more it went down hill so fast. I ordered 3 Pizzas Tuesday night Hot and ready and Out of all three of the Pizzas only one Pizza Had a Piece of Hair on the Pizza. This is not the first for Little Caesars. I did do research March 31,2016 in Livonia, MI a Customer found a Piece of Hair in the Little Ceasers Pizza.       By the time my friend said something and got my phone out and take a picture it was to late. A Hair on a Pizza is a Major health code violation and we all know when something like this happens the health department has to be notified. In the Near future I would not recommend returning to this location or any location."}
{"text":"I'm so excited about the new pizza portal!! Instead of the painfully slow lines and waiting 40 minutes for $5 pizza now you can order on line before you leave the kids game or whatever and when you show up you just type in your 3 digit code and the pizza portal automatically opens up magically revealing your order. You just grab it and go."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. It is literally the Walmart of pizza. Do not bring your family here."}
{"text":"Honestly i will stop coming to this location, great food but the wait is just horrible!  Every time i have to wait more than 20mins :("}
{"text":"Fresh crispy pizza. Kids are happy I'm happy. You can't beat $5 for a quick dinner"}
{"text":"Cheap, and good pizza!  Fast, and good service. And sooo close! Love the drive thru option too!"}
{"text":"Like the person on the bottom of this review said it's supposed to be hot and ready but when it came here a few weeks ago there was 5 or 6 people waiting in line in front of me it was in access of 15 maybe 20 minutes  close to 30 when I came that day. The customer service is not bad as the lady was friendly and polite and helpful but the wait time here for hot and ready Pizza is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Worst Lil Caesars ive ever been to. Ordered for pick up, get there 30 min later and they apparently had given my order to someone else. I was told 8 minutes for a new order. 15 min later i finally have my order with a free order of wings from the Mgr for my wait. Get home and Supreme pizza is OLD ! Wings taste like bad fish with a crazy amount of hot sauce on them, and my Italian cheese bread has almost no cheese on it and was almost burnt."}
{"text":"It is what is is!  $5 carry out pizza on demand, no need to call ahead.  Of course the crust is a little cardboardy and not soft and doughy, but they don't skimp on the cheese or toppings.  Never going to be as great as a premium parlor's pizza, but for $5 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I just left the Little Caesar in Indiantrail for the second time because they did not have what I was ordering so drove to Monroe where the employees are nice and friendly   The girl charged me for breadsticks instead of what I ordered Italian Cheese Bread when she called the manager over to correct total charged  , the manager said just leave it at cheaper price . That is good service and good food."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! Waited at least 25 minutes for bread. They have a sign saying if we domt offer you crazy bread then you ger it free....not once did i hear the female cashier offer ir to anyone...not even myself. The employees looked like bums. No hairnets on food handlers no upselling wbatsoever! Idk how they keep their doors open. Pizza was cold and the italian cheese bread i ordered that took over 20 minutes to make had no flavor and  hardly had any cheese on it. Wanted buffalo wings...they didnt have the sauce...only bbq or plain? I will not go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"This place should be shut down asap! There must be a bug infestation there, I've come in early around 11:00 because it's usually slow at that time, and have seen dead roaches in the lobby!!!!!! God only knows how many are in the back. I used to love coming here but recently it seems to be just a health hazard having bugs there. Anyone wanna call the health department?"}
{"text":"Hey it's a good pizza for the price! You can feed alot of people inexpensively and there pretty quick on the service. The wings are a nice lunch snack but seemed smaller this last time ,get the jalapeno cheddar or butter garlic dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this isn't the best pizza you will ever eat, but you can't beat the five dollar dandy (as we call it) I'm from Michigan, which is where this chain (and dominoes) started and I can honestly say that the crazy bread here taste more like it originally did that a lot of the sleezers back in MI. For the money you just can't beat it. They have $5 large pepperoni and cheese only pizzas ready and waiting for you. We've been to this one a number of times and the pizzas are always good, never taste like they've been sitting forever. If you've never had a sleezers pizza before I'll tell you what they are like...the crust is on the thin side (and isn't the best cold, if you like the left overs definitely want to nuke it or put it in the oven) the cheese is good and the sauce has a nice unassuming flavor. Highly recommend some crazy bread to accompany your pizza. There is some nice garlic butter on it and cheese sprinkled on.....if you really adventurous go for the Italian cheese bread....it is quite a delight! So, go forth and have you five dollar dandy!!"}
{"text":"I just want to let everyone know this place is ran bad before you go and waste your time. Came in on a Friday night and I understand a lot people are going to be ordering, so telling me 10-15 is fine. But when people who order after me get their food and I'm still waiting, the of course I'm going to get mad. I ordered a simple pizza and crazy bread. After about 25 I finally get my food. I get home and eat the pizza. The pizza is too doughy and not fully cooked, it wasn't even completely hot. My crazy bread, don't get me started. It was straight up dough and butter. When I opened the bag, the bread was flat and soggy. Very disappointed with the over visit to little ceasers. Before you waste your time, don't go to this little ceasars. If you want to wait 25 minutes go order Dominos or Pizza Hut, you'll get your food fast."}
{"text":"Serious question, do they EVER answer their phone? Read all the reviews on ow the never have \"Hot and Ready\" already made, so I tried calling to place an order. Called three time in the last 10 minutes and no answer. Frustrating."}
{"text":"Hot and ready? Haha nope. 20 min wait. Every. Single. Time. Not to mention their crazy bread seemed a bit doughy... I still ate it tho."}
{"text":"Good customer service but out of everything! No crazy bread, no box combos because they \"don't have the seasonings needed\" and even out of napkins!"}
{"text":"You can never beat the prices and the crust is always the best because of the cornmeal!! Place is clean , busy and fast !! The group working there could use a little more personality !"}
{"text":"The pizza is just as good as any other Little Caesars, but as others have said, the hot and readys aren't ready.  Been here twice and had the non ready issue once."}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza places in my area, I'd have to say I like this one the best. I eat there quite frequently, and over the past few years I've become quite acquainted with the menu.  The pizza, as the name suggests is hot and ready. That's not just a gimmick to get you to come in and buy their pie. I'm always quite surprised by how fast the pizza actually comes out. At most it's taken me around 2 minutes to get my pizza. Compare that to Georgio's which takes around 20 minutes to get a good pizza. If you get the $9 meal deal, you're going to be able to feed you and your family for at least 2 nights. It comes with breadsticks, large pepperoni or cheese pizza, marinara sauce, and a 2 liter beverage of your choice. If you have a larger family, I'd recommend you go with the Party starter which is $14.00 and comes with all of the normal stuff except with an extra large pizza. Definitely worth the money.  The employee I usually speak to doesn't know much English, but I'm fine with it. He is very familiar with the menu and will get you in and out quickly without much communication. I suppose the only real downside is that you can't dine in. You can only eat the pie at home."}
{"text":"11/10/16  Went in and placed an order. Huge line and I ended up waiting 10 minutes. While I was waiting I was standing to the side watching them make the pizza in the back. There was an older lady with gray hair and a younger girl with long brown hair making pizzas without gloves on! I did see the girl at the long brown hair wash her hands prior to making the pizza. But NO gloves????  Good pizza and friendly staff. They always give my son crayons and something to color."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience because of the girl employee there, she was slender with reddish or blonde hair (just for credit). Anyways, she took control and made the experience, that could've been rough with the line out the door, to absolutely amazing! She sorted through every customer, while communicating to the kitchen what was needed and I ended up, with a dollar upcharge , the most amazing little Cesar's pizza I've ever had in just moments. She was even able to lead me into the best option with pleasantries. I applaud that type of work anywhere I go and it is much deserved to her and her team. Way to go!"}
{"text":"False advertising. Nothing hot or ready. Me and 6 others told to wait 10 mins. Then after 10 mins nothing ready still."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I went in for a bestest, and boy. Did they have the bestest looking guy up there with tattoos! I think his name is Jordan, but I'd try his 3 meat any day of the week! He was so nice and deserves a raise and a promotion!"}
{"text":"They didn't let me buy a pizza at 9:50pm because they closed at 10pm mind you they had a pizza ready..... so lazy"}
{"text":"Lunch special of deep-dish slices and a drink for $5 is mad decent. Deep dish pizza here is surprisingly good, and even buying a whole is cheap, but only if we're talking calories and not nutrition.   Location is in a strip mall plaza, in a smaller building near the street- interior is pretty bare and small, as most LC's are. Service is fairly quick and polite, though I've been known to come shortly before close when they're down to only one or two guys working and things get backed up. But at least your pizza is super fresh.  Haven't worked up the nerve to try their new pretzel pizza but someday I'm sure I'll get around to it one of these days."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. But today was just not a good experience. Inside was full of flies. Even the cashiers had to be waiving the flies off. I ordered some wings and pizza. The size of the wings is getting ridiculous. It's pretty much just the bone. The size of the wing is like baby carrot plus they where one step away from being burnt."}
{"text":"Second time in a row the pizza was extremely cold, old, cheese was over done, and it was cut terribly. Meaning tiny slices to BIG slices. Taste is horrible.  Was hoping the first time was just them having an off day. A shame because it use to be good for $5 pizza."}
{"text":"This is really a hit or miss place sometimes the service can be good and sometimes awful it all depends on the workers at the time. I really like this location because of the convenience of being close to my home whenever I get a craving for Caesars pizza this is the place I go to pick up the pizza. I totally love their pizzas the crust and dough are a hit with me and my family. Of course we like other high end pizza but we always come back to Caesars pizza one of the few pizza that I can eat cold right out of the refrigerator. That's why I'll put up with the inconsistency of the service because the pizza is really what it's all about and the pizza has always been consistent."}
{"text":"They had a lunch deal with 4 slices and a drink but I didn't mind paying a buck more for a whole pizza. This meant if have leftovers anyway so it worked out. I've been by for lunch a couple times now and the pizza has been fresh, hot, and most important it tasted good. You can't beat a pizza for $5 that actually tastes decent. The crazy bread is always a plus too. The girl working behind the counter was nice and inside was clean. The parking lot can be crazy at certain times. Call your order in if you want a certain pizza to avoid any wait."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and always impressed!  The twin sisters who work here are super personable and have my name and order memorized.  They deserve an award for all their hard work! It was super busy and the team still had our order ready on time!!"}
{"text":"5 Dollar hot and ready pizzas are such a great deal. The staff was prompt and friendly and got me in and out in a matter of minutes."}
{"text":"I'd rather spend $10 for a pizza then $5 at least i get a smile and personality! The girl on register is like a robot and just stares if you call this customer service then I'm sure this place will eventually be closed down! She has no suggestive selling skills no ability to smile. She looks like she needs at least a year of sleep whoever the manager is here needs to pay more attention and get ride of this energy killer!"}
{"text":"They just need to give up and shut down , the wait time is ridiculous and everyone that works at the locations have 5th grade education. I got here at 4:30 it's 5:22 and I'm still waiting for my Pizzas they need real management and more staff"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow slow. Poorly made pizza. Rude staff. What else is therto say?"}
{"text":"I am was passing through Goodyear and was wanting a pizza. So I  went to this place and ordered the pretzel dippers and two deep dish pizza. It was late but they had customers comin and going.  My order got dropped and watched several orders after mine leave. I contacted the manager and he personally assured me my order was going to be right up. He did live up to his word and it came. But was short a deep dish. He did give me a hot and ready and an extra crazy bread. I would say this place was friendly and I would stop in again."}
{"text":"Hoping to grab a \"hot n ready\" pizza. I called in the order before I headed that direction. They told me 10-15m. I thought perfect! I arrived there 25m later and thinking it was going to be a pay and go type deal. They told me it wasn't ready. There was only one person ahead of me. I waited another 20m for 2 pizzas.  It wasn't a sport night or weekend."}
{"text":"Last 4 times we've gotten pizza was a real disappointment. They skimp so much on sauce and cheese, it's not enjoyable. We can hardly swallow it down. I insisted my hubby take it back but he's tired, hungry and doesn't want to wait for another to cook. Soooo, I'm complaining here, on their website and will call them.   As it is there are a lot of other pizza places around to take our weekly business to.  I'm thinking maybe this place is hoping to pad the bill by having us order extra sauce, cheese etc to make it the way we used to get it from them.  I have no doubt they will steadily lose business and close this location if they consistently skimp like they have been. Next time we get a taste for pizza we will go to Mod. Much better value."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place again after swearing we would never be back. I wish we would have stayed away.   Ordered two pizzas and a breadstick and when we got home everything was RAW. The pizza \"crust\" was just white dough. No browning at all. It was soft and mushy and raw inside. The cheese was not fully melted and the veggies were raw.   Breadsticks were white and doughy with no browning at all.   WILL NEVER BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"I love it here.... I mean. How much quality do you really expect from a place that sells you $6 pizzas already made. Its fast and ready to go. They have great dippings suaces for the breadsticks. Lots of soda choices too. Little Caesars. Great for a quick addition to a bbq or a Game to watch on TV."}
{"text":"I was so hoping that the newest addition of the \"Pizza Portal\" ordering option using the app would help alleviate the issues with this location.  That could not have been further from the truth. I used the app to order 2 pizzas.  It said that my pizzas would be ready in about 20 minutes.  I showed up at the store at the estimated time.  10 minutes after the time I was given, I needed to ask for a manager to get my order fulfilled.  Still a better option to go to the location located at Nellis and Lake Mead or anywhere else actually.  Skip this location if you appreciate your sanity."}
{"text":"Staff is rude have almost a hundred dollar order and they won't except a bill over 20 then pizza was burnt and had to argue to get them to fix it the lady keep trying to get me to take the burnt pizza. Finally the manger realized what was going on took the pizzas said he would fix them and gave me 2 breadsticks to apologize. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I HATE when they tell me one time when it's really another, they told me it would be 8 minutes before I paid. I clearly asked because I didnt have time. That was at 9:30, I received my pizza at 9:54. Avoid this place if you're in a hurry. Then the workers had an awful attitude. Never coming back"}
{"text":"My favorite inexpensive pizza now that they have added more butter to their crust. Love the $5 lunch special \"Deep dish-4 pieces and a soda.\" Also love the more cheesy called the extra most bestest. Great for my taste buds but not my waistline. They are dangerous close to where I live."}
{"text":"So my wife is allergic to dairy, not lactose intolerant, but straight up deathly allergic to cheese. Being poor college students, we have always ordered pizza from Little Caesars one- half no cheese, the other half normal to share. But when we came to this location the employees, the manager, and the district manager freaked out on us and rudely stated that they will never serve us or anyone halves on a pizza. This is ridiculous, they have always done this before, but if they wish to alienate all of my family, my in-laws and everyone that I will tell, then shame on them.  Go to any of the little Caesars or local pizza places that will cater to your family's needs."}
{"text":"if I can give this place no stars I would. This place had the most horrible service. They didn't know how to handle customers, I seen six people walk out cause he said an hour wait for one pepperoni pizza. Which is supposed to be hot and ready.  And the pizza doesn't even look appealing."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars because it's the best little Cesar's I've ever been to. The people are nice and very speedy. The longest I've ever waited for a hot and ready is 5 mins. Every thing is always cooked fine. I really prefer this location over the one on Durango. I've never had a problem here - there I've had many. Thanks to girl with black and purple hair and brown hair with braids for being awesome on 4/8 during a huge rush.   Edit: okay, just finished getting my pizza and I've literally never seen this location so busy. I was told it would be a 10 min wait and it was again barely 4 mins but it was super packed! I wish I could tip, these kids were really rushing to get everyone's food out."}
{"text":"Someone listened!  Tried LC 3 x before writing this review.  The pizzas are cooked perfectly, the stores are adequately staffed, good job!"}
{"text":"Figured I'd get the extra most bestsest pizza. After waiting for what seemed like 10-15 minutes i finally receive my pizza only to go home and find out I had recieved an extremely undercooked pizza. Not fun spending extra money on a pizza just to get one worse than the regular priced version. I go to this location often and many times find the teenagers behind the counter to be very short with you as if they don't have time to serve you."}
{"text":"Horrible place to go for pizza!!! They didn't have a cheese pizza ready at all.  The lady at the drive through proceeds to tell me why which I don't exactly care.  Fast and ready?! Yea right!"}
{"text":"I have this place another try since they updated there online ordering. I ordered online and the email said it would be ready by 6:23. I am standing in the store still waiting for my pizza 10 minutes later. The point of ordering online and having a pick up time is so you don't have to wait... but here, they just give your pizzas away to angry customers who didn't get their pizza after waiting the 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I ordered a 1/2 sausage 1/2 Hawaiian pizza and I got an artists vision of the possibility of a perfect pizza! Not only did it look perfect but was the best Little Caesers pizza I've ever purchased. Robert is the man of perfect pizza!"}
{"text":"My kids insisted on trying the Bacon Wrapped Deep Dish Pizza which surprisingly enough is not bad. Also, apparently everything is now part of the hot and ready so you can just stop in and pick up a pizza to go.  While I still prefer other pizza places, this is a good option for a cheap and quick meal."}
{"text":"Normally the pizza is pretty good but as of late has been a little more dodgy. Always in and out fast which is nice. Definitely recommend ordering it fresh if you have the 10 min or so."}
{"text":"I will never eat at little Caesars again, while the limited edition pretzel crust pizza was still available my mom and I went to this location and got 2 pretzel crust pizzas and went home, when we went to dish them out I was surprised to find the cheese was moldy and not 'oh it's just a spice' no it was a greenish blue color, took both pizzas straight back, got a refund and went to a dominos."}
{"text":"Very convenient location! Very funny and helpful employees! Food always delicious! Wings and pizza!! Can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!!  Came in with one of the kids to pick up and we were greeted immediately. One of the workers gave the lil one a coloring page and crayons. I asked her for a few more (for the kids at home) and she put some in a bag with cookies.  Pizzas were fresh and always a great price!"}
{"text":"I am vegan and had only been there twice and my second time the manager was able to remember exactly what I wanted on my pizza! (which is no easy feat) And my pizzas are always perfect, the service is always fast and good - even when I order special. LOVE THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"Worst little caesars ever. Been there a dozen times and not once have they ever had pizza hot and ready. If you like cold and unready pizza that will be hot and ready after a 20 minute wait, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"If the other LC wasn't so far from my house, I would not return here ...... first off , we weren't greeted just asked what we wanted .... given our 3 pennies in change pizza and that was it ... not even my receipt..... no goodbye , have a nice night, thanks for coming in ... or even eye contact or a smile ... NOTHING..... and they have a promotion going on where if they don't offer the crazy combo you get the combo for free .... wasn't offered it ... so when we paid I mentioned it ...... and she ignored me. Figures. Then we get the pizza and it wasn't cut ... it looked like it was but when we pulled it apart to eat a slice in the car it split the slices in half ... so I went in and asked them to recut it ... the gentleman cutting pizza shook his head and rolled his eyes and the girl , gave me back the pizza and argued with attitude to me saying the pizza was cut; I then argued back and said yeah maybe it looked like that on top but if you looked under the cutting didn't go through ... mind you we were eating this pizza in the car ... not easy to cut a pizza on your own in a car ... just so rude all the employees.... attitude adjustments and customer service needs improvement here."}
{"text":"Dont expect a quick visit. They dont have enough employees to handle more than one order at a time."}
{"text":"Great service!  I called in on a busy night and ordered 12 pizzas for a bunch of hungry little boys. I was told it would be 30 minutes, and the pizzas were 100% ready when I arrived about 25 minutes later, even though they were clearly very busy with continual incoming orders from walk-ins. I know that this place isn't gourmet, or somewhere you'd go for amazing pizza, but I thought they did a great job staying on top of things!"}
{"text":"First off, this place sells Little Caesar plush dolls. That is awesome and should be worth a star there alone. I'm a big fan of restaurant mascots and I think we all might go to McDonald's once or twice to get a Grimace or Hamburglar doll. But that just might be me ;)  Location wise, its in a nice spot, across from Banner and within walking distance of MCC. There's not a lot of pizza places in this stretch and its right off the freeway too.  This is one of the nicest looking Little Caesar's pizzerias Ive seen. They have a lot of branded merchandise, bibs, toys, slicers and spatulas - which I haven't seen at a Little Caesar's before and that's pretty novel.  This location just opened yesterday and they were slammed. In the time I was there, about 10-15 minutes, They must've served at least 20-25 customers, so I have little doubt this place is filling a necessary void.  This place being new as well I didn't have their number. I usually like to call ahead since I don't like the Hot 'N Ready thing all the time and like having custom toppings. I showed up placed my order and waited. And what happened next, is what prompted me to write the review. They made a slip up with the pizza and let me know it wasn't right and offered me a three meat pizza on the spot or if I waited and gave them a chance to make it right, they'd comp my meal and give me free 2 liter of Pepsi and an order of Crazy Bread. I probably would've been ok with just the hey, let us fix this - cuz that says they care about what they're putting out.   The order came a few minutes later and before that the owner let me know, hey we care about good food but feel bad about making you wait so on top of the comp, we're going to give you a voucher for free pizza and free Crazy Bread on your next visit. Again, really above and beyond. Pizza came out shortly and they threw in not one but TWO free orders of Crazy Bread I didn't order just to say hey, sorry.  Chain or not, any business that takes the time to own up to any problems before they are problems and make good for them multiple ways should be lauded and thats the behavior that gets patrons to come back.  And the pizza was good too.  Plus, you know PLUSH DOLL!"}
{"text":"This location very rarely has anything \"hot and ready\". However, they are always swamped. The employees always seem like they are busy but it takes entirely too long and nobody in back wants to help the people out front. Today, while I visited, they were playing highly inappropriate music...making me uncomfortable. The gentlemen sitting next to me stood and walked outside to wait. I saw him shake his head after he heard the music. There has to be something you can do for this location. New management, new assistants, etc. the two gentlemen out front were very nice and apologetic."}
{"text":"Wow! It wasnt that busy when i came in but still sat and waited for a half hour for my order. The staff was so busy about their own personal lives, they had forgotten they had customers. The counter person actually had his friends come in after 10 minutes of my order and they had their pizza 5 minutes after mine, they even ordered wings. I think i even heard someone say \" omg!! There is a pizza on the floor\", Then a minute later i get my order, i dumped that shit and went somewhere else. Never again, very VERY unprofessional. I dont trust the food being served. Grade F. Uniforms of the employees so dirty! Thanks for ripping me off with these loser ass kids!"}
{"text":"Fkn nasty!  I wouldn't feed this to my worst enemy! Food is disgusting. Drenched in grease. And the fat dude behind the counter needs to clip his dutty nails. Service was alright. But everything else is pretty gross. Will not be coming back here. And I don't recommend anybody eating whatever the hell they're serving."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! Terrible service, always a line of people and the place is filthy! Would it kill ya to clean the windows? For a food service location, I would think first impressions would matter!!"}
{"text":"We use Little Caesar's because it is fast and easy to get our order. We use the portal. The past 2 times we have ordered pizza, crazy bread and crazy sauce with cinnamon bread for desert.  Little Caesar HAS NOT giving us the crazy sauce with our bagged order. I have called and instead of them trying to fix their error by telling me next time I will get crazy bread or something.. They say \"oh sorry do you want to come back and get the crazy sauce\" Heck No that isn't good customer service at all. I am not going to leave home to go back because your employees can't get the order into the portal correct."}
{"text":"Hair in our pizza! Called to let them know after we opened the box at the office for lunch ... management did nothing wanted us to drive us back and return the pizza for a refund. Horrible customer service. Zero stars"}
{"text":"I call this pizza \"dining on a budget\" pizza. Meaning when you are broke and close to payday...and you have nothing to eat..   It doesn't compare to dominos or pizza hut or even papa johns...but if you are hungry...you will eat almost anything.  Its always packed for the special $5 Hot and Ready Pizza...but this wouldn't be my first choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and quick service.  Went and got a hot and ready bacon wrapped deep deep dish pizza.  Being from Detroit there's not much choice for Detroit style deep dish pizza out here.  Little Caesars is on every corner back home and it's nice to see them expanding all over the country.  Back to the pizza: it's almost sinful how much crust and bacon is on this pizza.  There was a perfect amount of sauce and cheese topped with pepperoni and more bacon pieces sprinkled on.  I'm sure it took a few years off my life for this pizza but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Always great service and the pizza quality is the best of all the L.C, in my area. And trust me I've been to all of them."}
{"text":"OK there is one best pizza place in town and we all know who that is been here forever and its not these guys. Now I was a fan of Little Caesars  when I was young it was a lot of pizza for cheap and as teenagers that was good lol but I had not tried it in 20 years. I would say if the pizza is fresh and hasn't been sitting there long like the fast and ready pepperoni its not bad however sometimes they seem a bit old if business is slow. Its better to order a special one and not the fast and ready ones for a tastier fresher pizza. Out of all the other pizza joints fast food style they are better I think its not great pizza but its OK for a cheap take home to the kids for a quick dinner. Time will tell if they get there act together and last I think he biggest hurdle is making sure there not serving pizzas that have been sitting there for 30 minutes plus and are already hard and dried out. I will keep trying them from time to time to see how it goes so far the quality hasn't always been good sometimes its OK and sometimes its not good. I wouldn't mind if they stayed in business its nice for a quick pizza and really all the other places are not good at all except of course the oldest one in fallon but they are a bit pricey. I do have to say the other pizza place starts with a D wont be in business long only reason they were around this long is they delivered."}
{"text":"Worst customer service - nothing is ever ready. There is always a line of pissed off people. Phone rings with no one answering it. I forget how bad it is and every so often give it another try. Bad idea."}
{"text":"I came in thirty minutes before they closed, and they were just as nice and helpful as if their shift first started. Thank you to the ladies who gave me great customer service and I didn't even wait ten minutes to get my pizzas."}
{"text":"It's always a handy option when you're not up to cooking for the tribe. Their customer service is fast and polite. The product is what it is, not the best but better than a stick in the eye when your in a pinch."}
{"text":"The hot and ready pizza more like the hot and WAIT pizza THIS IA MAKING ME ANGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's Little Caesars, so it's nothing extra special. Off to the side on Guadalupe, the place is at least filled with friendly staff, and they are quick with the orders."}
{"text":"I have a serious problem with the management at this location, The last four times I've been here theres always a wait time for Hot N Ready items and/or a line out the door. How is the manager not able to gauge the timeframe for rush hour and make sure they're prepared? I've already complained to corporate but this is just unnaceptable, My time is too valuable to wait around"}
{"text":"I was half expecting this location to be closed. It was 10:45pm, and after visiting another Little Caesars that was supposedly open until 11pm and being disappointed, this one didn't look any more active. It must be the window advertising blocking out all the light inside. Low and behold, they were still open, and had some hot and ready pepperoni ready and waiting, as promised. Phew!  It's a Little Caesars, what can you say. The pizza was just right, and fulfilled my craving for Pizza NOW! Are there any 24 hour locations? If so, I would be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I Love Little Caesars Pizza. There's nothing quite like it.  No, it's not the highest quality pizza in the world, but you know what really makes it? The crazy bread. A bag of crazy bread followed by their veggie pizza. Oh My God. Happiness at its best.  The other thing I really love is that Little Caesars Pizza crust isn't greasy AT ALL. I know, I know, it's not like it matters if I'm going to inhale an entire bag of Crazy Bread before even starting on the pizza, but still! Regardless of if it's a 'healthy' day or a 'bad' day, I still never like greasy pizza crust.  Little Caesars is one of my all-time favourite types of pizza and there's nothing that will change that any time soon."}
{"text":"Went in with a coupon for a free pizza. The employees, who appeared to have died on the inside long ago, were able to take the coupon, turn around, get a barely lukewarm pizza out of the warming drawer, and hand it to me. Cool, great, no problem with that. The problem is that they had two, three foot high stacks of pizza boxes, on the *floor*, in the kitchen. Boxes that were pre-made and ready to have pizzas and breads put into them. Which, if you didn't know, is a huge safety concern. You wouldn't put plates on the floor and then use those plates to put food on and serve to people.  Now, unsurprisingly, my wife is having stomach issues. Don't get food from Little Caesar's. You can do better. Even if you have a free coupon."}
{"text":"Call my order in less cheese more sauce guess what have to repeat it twice less cheese more sauce, went to pick up pizza I got more cheese less sauce. I don't how to say it no other way. It shouldn't be that hard to get right."}
{"text":"ok i like this location and there pizza im just upset the workers here are in a rush  i called at 925pm to order 2 pizza light sauce and two wing order they said will have it ready  when i got there like 10 min they said we ran out of wings i said no problem ill wait for them to come out and he said oh no its to late where not making anymore!!! like seriously u close at 10 i called in advance and u still decide u wont make wings because ur closing in 20 min ! what is wrong with you people ! now i see why u guys have so bad reviews! this is unacceptable"}
{"text":"Hot n ready pizza wasn't ready to go. Waiting room was PACKED with people and they had none ready."}
{"text":"These guys get so much activity, especially on Fridays. They handle everything extremely well under pressure and so pleasant and professial. I feel bad that they have to deal with impatient people. I give them 5 stars. When calling in orders always make sure they read back the right order. I was driving and ordering my Pizzas and I thought the guy heard me right and I heard him right. Then when I got there he read off my order but there were so many people I couldn't really hear so I nodded my head. Turns out they heard me wrong and I heard them wrong too. Definitely not their fault they were very gracious! I highly recommend this location. Very professional under pressure."}
{"text":"20 minutes for 2 cheese pizzas, and about 5 people after me received their same cheese pizzas first. Little Caesars are usually packed but the service at this location is beyond slow and not fair."}
{"text":"I would give one star but the employees are nice so I gave 2 stars.  This is on the way home. I stopped by twice before and the pizza was not good.  It tasted like cardboard, was over cooked, spicy odd tasting sauce.  Kind of tasted like someone scooped it up off the floor, it actually tasted dirty.  I gave it sometime and drove to another location for awhile.  I thought I would give this location one more try.  The pizza was the same.  Nasty overcooked cardboard and the crazy bread was burned yet chewy.  I wont be coming back to this location again.  I will drive past my house to the Silverado ranch location.  The pizza there is always cooked just right and the bread sticks are yummy.  Too bad the eastern location is so bad, the employees up front are super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever received in my life! my friends and I went to Vegas for new years and decided to grab a pizza before going out, we had to wait 15 minutes for a pepperoni pizza and the employees were so rude and disrespectful! I will never return!"}
{"text":"Hot but NEVER ready. Every time I go in I think it will be different, but it's always an at least 10 minutes wait for anything and end up going to the Taco Bell right there instead."}
{"text":"I thought this was Hot and Ready- took forever to get pizza- workers need to work more efficient and quit talking and joking around - I will go to Peter Piper next time-"}
{"text":"The past 2 months this place has really gone to garbage.  Staff and management are the worst.  Pizza has either been burnt or way too much sauce.  For a place that is suppose to be hot and ready, 95% of the time you end up waiting 15-30 minutes.  I guess you really get what you pay for, actually for the service and quality of the food they should  change the price from $5 to $0.25."}
{"text":"U freakin hate this place. Nothin but little assholes work there. The pizza is always garbage. Im so tired of this place ive given chance after chance. The manager Tracy, if thats even her name has no business bein a manager. Barely any cheese barely any sauce. When i ask for fresh same shit."}
{"text":"Scummy area that smacks of bad news, but the staff has remarkable work ethic and the pizza is predictably good. I dig the crazy bread best. I would like to try the deep dish sometime. The gal working the register exchanged some small talk about hair dye and was really personable. The pizza and breadsticks didn't take long, and was the usual greasy + tasty combo I expect at Little Caesar's."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times, but both times, there was hardly any wait, and the employees were very friendly. Nicole was very kind and efficient, and understanding about paying with some change. Awesome place for a quick, greasy, guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible. We ALWAYS have to wait at least 20 mins... I thought the whole point of little caesars was \"hot and ready\"?? If I wanted to wait 20+ minutes I would have went to dominos or Pizza Hut. Also they need to learn how to cut a pizza properly.. I always have to re cut it when I get home. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Trust the reviews, I read the reviews and still tried to give them a chance. As soon as I pulled up, I knew all the other reviews were true. There was a line out the door and when I overheard the cashier tell the customer ahead of me that there was a 40 MINUTE wait for a hot n ready pizza, I left so quick. That defeats the whole concept of Little Caesar's hot n ready pizzas. I was very annoyed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The $5 hot 'n ready ... is NEVER, and I mean NEVER hot 'n ready. Every time I go here (probably 2-3 times a month) I have to wait for pizza.  I tried the other location in Surprise and it was the same issues. I only come back to this one because the workers are slightly more friendly."}
{"text":"I used to eat at many different Little Caesars. However, just the other night, I found mold in my pizza. I tried calling this store & also corporate, they never answered nor called me back. Customer service sucks. Will not be eating Little Caesars ever again. :("}
{"text":"It is cheap, fast, and unhealthy ;)   However, we all need a quick fix once  in a while and this place does it for me.   It was my first time on this location. In places like this, I do not have high expectations. Service was descent.   Usually, you are in and out. For that reason I am giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hey bro forgot to to slice the pizza.  Good thing I had a pizza cutter.  The pizza sells itself. You had 1 job.  Lol"}
{"text":"I haven't been impressed with the wait times.  What exactly is your service level agreement on Hot And Ready items all day every day?  I don't recall a time there was a Cheese or pepperoni pizza actually hot and ready.   Every single time has been nearly 10 minutes or more even after being quoted 6-7 minutes.  Understanding traffic flow, busy times throughout the days id imagine your staff could be more proactive by making a couple pizzas to be ready vs being reactive.  I have also witnessed the line getting backed up because someone orders multiple pizzas.   It appears that your staff will try to make all pizzas for each order at a time.   In the case of multiple pizzas, I'd imagine the customer ordering knows they'll wait longer.... but filter in the single orders as well to keep people moving.  The food is fine.  The staff are friendly.   It's just poor anticipation and poor time management that I'm witnessing.    Definitely correctable to provide a great customer experience in a short period of time"}
{"text":"Friday night = Huge line out the door. Unlike other Little Caesars I've been to, this location does not have any pizzas hot and ready. The 10 minute wait provided me with the opportunity to notice that none of the staff preparing the pizzas were wearing gloves. One of the employees even stopped making pizzas to go chat with a friend outside & resumed pizza making without gloves or cleaning his hands.  So grateful that I did not get sick after eating here. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"They failed tonight, I went in and purchased a hot and ready deep dish pizza. Was told there were orders ahead of mine and I would have to wait. The counter keep taking orders and not handing any out. They seam more interested in taking orders. About 25 people waiting. Two canceled their orders and about 5 walked out after hearing there was a wait.  After a few visits and when you hear what people order you learn where what pizza is kept where. So I watched and the area they have deep dishes they had some where around 8 total boxes. To look in the box they must be pulled through and opened. Two of the bottom ones were turned around about 5 mins after I arrived. They did give out deep dish pizzas to larger orders but the box that was turned around and look into was still there when I left 40 mins later.   Now I hear you, I totally did not look in the box nor did they try to give it to me so I don't know what really was in the box, but here is the thing, if it made to order, why is it sitting for 40 mins plus, remember it was in the front of there hot box before I arrived and it was still there when I left so who know how long it's really been there. If it was a hot and ready pizza why was it not given to me when I placed my order. Many people order before arriving and they still had to wait.   This store needs some adult leadership in the evening and they need to learn what hot and ready is, plus taken and order and give an order, rinse and repeat and you won't get backed up. Customers if you order a special pizza you have to wait.   Well that my story. Good luck.  Oh btw my pizza was not HOT, it had been resting and was a little warm."}
{"text":"We usually come to this location and we usually get are pizzas the way they should be on time period but today we had a long wait when the pizza finally got there it was not cut the cashiers name is Celsa L. We called to complain and she laughed and said I knew I forgot something. I think I will find me a new Little Caesars to go to after this"}
{"text":"4 teenagers at the house wanting little caesars... what can I do, I guess it won't hurt them every now & then"}
{"text":"The staff was quick and friendly! Luckily, i didn't have to wait for the pizza to be made. Thanks for a happy belly."}
{"text":"Came to this location because it was convenient for me. Their slogan is Hot n Ready but there was 7 people waiting for pizzas and a lady complaining they messed up a custom pizza. I ordered 2 pizzas and after I paid is when I was told I had to wait because they didn't have any."}
{"text":"Most disgusting experience ever. There was a really long hair in my hot wings. I took one bite and felt the hair pulled it out and felt it as it was coming out my throat!!! Yuck. Called them about it all they said is bring back the wings and your receipt and we'll give you your money back like it was no big deal..Yeah right like I'm gonna drive back just to get $6 back not even worth the traffic and gas. Im staying at Planet Hollywood and I just thought I would write a review so people could be warned. Wish I had seen the reviews before going there."}
{"text":"Impressed today was my first time ever ordering over the phone, customer service explained $4 delivered charge and walked me through what's popular. Delivery super fast friendly lady delivery. Was impressed the pizza pan crust rocked chicken wings good. Garlic bread was super good. Will def order again"}
{"text":"Supervisor or someone with the combo to the safe does not wash hands. Puts cheese and pepperoni on pizzas with bare hands that he doesn't wash after giving his cashier some change. You can clearly see all this standing in the front counter.  Please sir, wash hands or put some gloves on at the very least when handling food."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Little Caesars for quite some time after seeing their ads on TV.   What can one expect from a $6.99 medium pizza? Not much. You get what you pay for. I've had better frozen pizzas from the grocery store.   There's nothing more to say."}
{"text":"Pizza never hot and ready. Gave them three tries. Third time waited 25 minutes for order then was told they burned my cheese bread. And had to wait another 15 mins. Lady next to me waited 25 mins and her pizza was sitting there the whole time. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I actually was pleased with the customer service today!! They opened right at 10:30 and opened the doors with a smile. Pizzas were hot and ready! The only suggestion I would make is...make the cuts more even and all the way through the pizza crust. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"This location used to be great. Now it's shit. No sausage pizza, nothing is ever ready, and the gangster element outside is ridiculous. The spent a bunch of money on remodeling and it sucks now. Should have kept the remod money and spent it on having sausage pizza available."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero starts I would. I called at 10 am to have pizzas ready at 1230 for my sons birthday party. I arrived at 1240 and was told that the pizzas would not be ready for another 10-20 minutes. Our car was loaded down with party supplies so my husband dropped my sons and I off so we could begin set up. When he returned to pick up the pizza 15 minutes after we had left, we were told that they accidentally gave our pizzas away and had to start making them all over again! My husband asked to speak to the manager and there was no apology offered or anything. My husband was 30 minutes late to his sons birthday party because apparently making cheese pizzas is a difficult concept for some. Will not be using this place ever again. The management and employees are a hot mess!"}
{"text":"Had to wait for a stuffed crust hot & ready. Ok, no big deal. Paid, gave my name & waited. Guess what? Got the wrong pizza! Was given a regular old hot & ready. Paid $10 for a not- ready-10-minute-wait (in a postage stamp sized lobby with a dozen people) $5-pizza. Grr."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what time of day you go, what day the week it is, they never have pizzas ready. Which is fine if you're Papa John's or Dominos, but when your slogan is hot and ready, you should have hot and ready pizza."}
{"text":"Tried to buy several pizzas here but only had a $50 bill.  They would not take the money because they won't take anything over a 20 even if order is more than a 20.  Lost customer for life."}
{"text":"Never going back. I have given them many chances realizing it is hard to guess when they would have a rush of customers. The last few times I went there was always a minimum wait of 10 minutes-not for a specialty pizza mind you-just for pepperoni. The last time I went/will ever go-I stood there while the cashiers were organizing registers and the counter top and never even addressed me standing there. When I walked out the door they finally asked if they could help. I can't wait for them to go out of business. terrible business plan, but for 5 dollars and the only pizza around-most customers are on foot, they will probably be in business for a while. You can make a much better pizza at home for the garbage they peddle."}
{"text":"Staff is unprofessional behind the counter and there's never any hot and ready pizza ready at a place that claims this as their motto."}
{"text":"Every time I come into this place they NEVER have hot and ready pizzas!!! That's the signature pizza so I'm confused on why I have to wait 15 minutes every time I come. The staff is rude and slow. Don't waste your time here!!! Just pay the extra 2 dollars and go to dominoes for a 7.99 carry out!!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars to this place I absolutely would. Their customer service is awful. I placed an order and they had no problem handing out the individual items of my order to other people and making me wait longer because not all of the items were ready at one time.  The staff did not care that they were inconveniencing every person that came through the doors during my 25 minutes there. Telling each person yeah will be making it, regardless of the situation or how long the people had already been waiting. I would strongly suggest going to another location or choosing to bypass the Little Caesars brand altogether."}
{"text":"They never have hot and ready pizza actually ready. Seems like every time I come to this location I have to sit and wait for a pizza. Not sure where the slump in workflow is. Avoid this place if at all possible."}
{"text":"I would give them no stars if I could. Literally the WORST and I mean WORST spot I have been to. There are never any hot and ready available. They do not acknowledge you. They do not take your order. You WILL wait 20 minutes for a place that suppose to give you your food right away."}
{"text":"Wife suggested a quick pizza for dinner last night so I went to pick a Hot n Ready pepperoni to go. Usually I am in and out in a minute. What the heck happened? Went to counter - ordered the pizza - paid for the pizza and then was told it would 5 to 10 minutes. (maybe you should say that before the customer pays?)I thought it may have taken a little longer then usual with the amount of people waiting in and out of the store. Finally after 25 minutes plus I received my pizza. While I was waiting numerous people came and left and about 4 to 5 people wanted refunds because they waited sooo long. Staff seemed very frazzled. I brought the pizza home and my wife asked \"where's the cheese\". Seemed to very skimpy on the cheese. Everyone has a bad day but this was a little out of hand."}
{"text":"So came in with kids for a $5 hot and ready and was told that nothing was ready. The wait was going to be at least 30 minutes. This to me does not seem like it falls under the hot and ready category. Very misleading as the guy was actively taking my order and I was about to pay when I decided to ask about how long it would take seeing as the store was full of people waiting."}
{"text":"Wow, why is our pizza taking over 30 min? Wait, what? What do you mean you burnt our pizza?  So...  If i wanted to wait this long for a pizza, i wouldve spent the extra $$ to get a real quality pizza.  Avoid this place at all cost.  Oh, and they ran out of crazy bread.   Manager compd our whole dinner. I'll give you an extra star for that."}
{"text":"Slowest service EVER!  They kept serving the people coming in ahead of 3 of us who were here first.  Unprofessional, everyone was cussing and joking around and they forgot to make bread in the middle of all of that...waited 45 min for 3 pizzas, wings and a crazy bread.  Definitely not coming back..."}
{"text":"Hot and ready my butt! My reason for coming here was to get pizza quick. Had to wait 20 mins"}
{"text":"I like this pizza unfortunately if you think you will get it \"Hot-N-Ready\" - you WILL be disappointed. Anthony (manager) keep track of the orders and your employees. Crazy bread and Pepperoni pizza at a minimum should be available for customers. Forgetting to put it in the oven is no excuse- after all, this is a pizza joint,RIGHT?"}
{"text":"I love the chesse bread there. Some of the employees/ Manager are the worst for customer services. If you get the deep dish pizza just be careful it might be burnt on the bottom."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST Little Cesar's pizza location ever. Management is terrible because they do not know how to properly plan for busy, high volume days.  Well you know how Little Cesar's is everyone's go to spot for quick pizza? Well that's why everyone decided to come here for the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight. They had pizzas in the hot box and pizzas ready to go but they refused to give them to customers who have been waiting inside for 30min!! These pizzas are supposed to be HOT AND READY. Nope, they would save them for PHONE ORDERS. Wtf?! Hello these are all the same pizzas!! You should be making countless amounts of pepperoni and cheese and be handing them as people order and of course by the time the pick up order comes they will have pizzas ready too! Maybe they'd have to wait an extra 5-10min but better than having others wait over 30min! It was terrible. And when we would have how long the orders would take, the register person would lie and say 10min. Little did we all know we were waiting 30-45min. Could have def went to a better pizza place and waited the same amount of time"}
{"text":"I tried calling my order in 20 min before closing and nobody answered 3 times. So I decided to drive there and place my order. When I arrived some lil girl greeted me with attitude. I noticed two employees arguing in the office. Then asked for a manager. This girl come out extremely rude and asked what I need. I told her about my experience and she told me \" well you pizza will be out soon. What more do you want?\" Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Staff courteous and pays attention to when order is ready. $5 dollar pizza good and the crazy bread/sauce awesome! For the price and quality it is a family fave to pick up."}
{"text":"It is okay for a quick pizza, but it is not for good or delicious pizza, and sometimes I stopped by for a pizza that I can not wait for liked 15-30 minutes for a pizza. It okay you might give it a try?"}
{"text":"I hate to rip a place apart because I know how difficult it is to survive as a small business in any economy let alone the one we're in, but I have to tell the truth. This simply is the saddest excuse for pizza I have ever tasted. This pizza is so bad, I'd rather eat frozen grocery store pizza than this garbage. The fact that they even try to pull this off as real pizza is a joke. No sauce at all on my pizza, and the crust literally tasted like cardboard. I'm not exaggerating here, this isn't worth feeding to your dog. And if you're trying to save money and buy this cheap imitation pizza for your kids in order to save money; don't do it, because once they are old enough to taste real pizza, they'll never forgive you for having done this to them. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, can't say it enough. Save yourself the agony and DON'T get this garbage, because you'll truly be sorry."}
{"text":"There's no one in the store except me and the workers. I put in my order, she swiped my card and walked into the back. No receipt, no time frame, she didn't even say I needed to wait or for how long. They're yelling and fighting in the back. I used to love this location. What happened? I'd leave if they didn't already charge my card. I won't be coming back and this is the closest one to where I live."}
{"text":"They burned our pizza and crazy bread. We went back to get better un-burned pizza and the sauces that she forgot to give us. The cashier there (the pretty black chick) had a good attitude and was the one who apologized, but she didn't even make the pizza. The one who made the pizza was some white blonde teenager, and she came out to ask us how we wanted our pizza.. Umm.. Not burned maybe? After waiting 20+ minutes, she came out to show us the new food she made us. The crazy bread was still overcooked but at this point we were like screw it, we're hungry and accepted it. The black chick started to butt in and back up the cook. The manager just watched what happened while she was on the phone on her break. No apology from her. The blonde chick gave us a free sauce including the one they forgot to give us, and we left. Not even an apology from her. We got home and the pizza was RAW. I hate them all. Literally, don't even waste your time here. Everyone here doesn't care about anyone but themselves. They're all here just for a paycheck and it's obvious."}
{"text":"I must say I normally don't write reviews but something caught my eye. I could tell they where busy making pizzas for us last minute folks but still a warm greeting. The young lady who took my order was extremely sweet. She was cheerful and a great person. I could tell she was tired but that didn't stop her from doing her job. As I sit here writing this review a little boy comes in and he grabs a bottle and nicks a few down. She says \"it's ok it happens\" not getting mad at him. I know plenty of people who would get mad and role their eyes. He voice was calm while talking to him treating him as if he was an adult not making him feel small. She let me know that my food was running a little late and it was ok. She truly is the meaning of customer service doing so much asking for little in return but making new customer who will come back to this location. I only wish I had gotten her name.      Melody is her name she is the best person there."}
{"text":"Last time I checked, a franchise is supposed to have their stuff together. Little Caesars doesn't fall into that category. I drove by this place for a quick \"hot n ready\" pizza, neither pizza was ready. The only positive? I was entertained by a guy doing the moonwalk outside while waiting for a pizza."}
{"text":"Your hours are horrible!! Closing at 10 on a weekend night, really. You should be open till at least midnight on weekends and 10/11 on week nights. You're a pizza joint for GODS sake."}
{"text":"It is true you get what you pay for I guess.  I had not gone to this Little Caesar's in a couple years as historically it has not been a good experience, but was craving Crazy Bread.  I walk in there a few folks waiting, which is a red flag already.  The place that advertises Hot N Ready never seems to have anything, but no biggie I really want this Crazy Bread lol.  Unfortunately, after about 5-10 minutes of standing, and zero acknowledgement decided the craving was gone.  This place is ran horribly.  I saw the few employees there walking around not sure what was going on.  The one person who I saw get a pizza had to send it back  as it was not cut.  As badly as this neighborhood needs businesses, and I would hate anyone to be unemployed we really need this place to close and start from scratch."}
{"text":"Why do I get so hooked by commercials? The bestest, mostest cheeseiest pizza was advertised to the kilt and as usual it did not live up to the way it looked. I did not notice any extra cheese, but there was clearly some extra pepperoni going on. The problem was the rock hard crappy crust. I ended up eating one slice and picking off some pepperoni for a sandwich. It was Only a $6 mistake, but will be avoiding this chain now for quite awhile (at least until the next commercials)."}
{"text":"Good, cheap pizza close to my house. A pepperoni or cheese pizza cost less than a store bought pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to this location on several occasions thinking I would give this place the benefit of the doubt, but boy was I wrong. The prices are great, but the food is NOT.   All three times I have gone to this location the people that worked there had messy work outfits/uniforms and smelt like smoke. They also had dirty fingernails and were acting very unprofessional. The first time I went there the pizza tasted like dirt and another time it was still doughy. I love Little Caesars, just not this location."}
{"text":"Update: Went today and the girl at the register was very rude! It was around 7:30pm! Not a happy customer.   WORST!!! WORST!! WORST!!! Little Caesars store ever!!!!! They never ever ever have a pizza hot and ready!!!!! Management should really step up and change all the employees in there. Make sure you ask them if your pizza is ready because even when your pizza is finally ready they still take forever to hand it over to you. I have to ask if my order is ready and then she's like oh yeah sorry... Papa Johns is faster when i order for delivery!! What's up with that!????? I've been here several times and it's always the same thing! Weekend, weekday, morning, night any time of the day there's always a longggggg wait time for a simple pepperoni pizza ... can't believe they don't fix this after all the bad reviews .."}
{"text":"Horrible, Ive had problems in the past with them treating me badly but always over looked it as maybe an off day for them. But today they told me pick up my order via phone in 20 minute which I was fine with only to arrive there for pick up and have them tell me I have to still wait... 40 minutes passed since I placed the order over the phone, I waited outside in my car since the place was packed full of angry customers already waiting on their delayed  food, I walk back in and I'm told I have to wait yet again. I then asked to speak with the manager who then blamed me for the delay, telling me I left so it's my fault it took so long. I was calm but after that I was deeply upset.Now I'm not a genius but whether I arrived early or late who's to blame for when food is done on time or not? The business or customer. As I left I asked for cookies for the kids and red pepper flakes and the managers response to me was this, verbatim \"we're busy here ok? We don't have any so goodbye goodnight\" I've been going to this little ceasars my entire life (20+ years) and they just lost me PERMANENTLY"}
{"text":"I loved the customer service, they were really friendly, but the prices were more than the other locations I've been too. I ordered some crazy breads that came out to $2.99 with pizza sauce, that's a lot more than the location on E Lake Mead Pkwy ($1.99). Wonderful service but more to pay."}
{"text":"I went there last week & there was a small mishap with my order so I called them back. Jillian answered & gave me my next oder free.  I went there last night to pick it up, she instantly remembered who I was.  She apologized multiple times, and was very genuine& nice.  I asked to buy 2 of the sauces& she freed those out too. Places get busy , def on Friday nights, the fact that she did everything she could to make it better & was genuine, is the reason ill be coming back."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Last 3 times I have been there NOT hot and ready!   Yesterday it was 4:30 and I was driving by and gave them one final shot.  I just wanted pepperoni pizza and crazy bread I was told it would be 15 minutes!  Where is the Hot and Ready?????  I will never go back to this location.   I drove to the store on Silverado and Bermuda.  They had the oven full of Hot and Ready items. No waiting. This has been the case the last 3 times I went to this store."}
{"text":"Don't laugh. The 4 stars isn't for the food obviously. I mean, what do you expect for $5? For the price the pizza is good and this place has been consistent for the last year since I have been living in Gilbert. I go there more than I'd like to admit.  They are always wonderful with my 3 year old son. They give him a bag of cookies every time without fail. They have never not made his day. The staff is nice. In and out in record time every time.   I call ahead and pick up randomly. If I call ahead my order is ready and correct. If I stop in they always have cheese and pepperoni in stock ready to go.   What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Im never happy here because its supposed to be Hot and Ready 4-8 It NEVER is Theres 14 people in here right now and not a pizza is ready which means, they really had no plan, on a Saturday night, to have pizza at 4.  I was told 15 minutes right now when i ordered.  This makes me sad"}
{"text":"This location is SO bad... Today there were no pizzas so i waited and she filled all the orders and left me standing there.  So a guy walks in and she takes AND fills his order... Then says can i help you? So i tell her id like my order and she said oh i called you and you didnt answer so we put your order back. Are you really serious?????  Then while shes trying to fill my order shes complaining about an 8 hour shift No breaks and idk but she couldnt manage to gwt my order into the bag"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place.  When they first opened, they were pretty good.  The last 6 months or so, it seems like every time I go, their pizza is overcooked and dry.  This is the third time I've gotten hot n ready pizza that are dry and crunchy.  The cheese is mostly hard and brown and the crust on the deep dish is rock hard.  As I'm writing this, my husband just said, geez, this crust is hard as a rock!  So, it's not just me.  I think I'm done giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Quick and affordable! Whenever I host a party for my teenagers, this conveniently located pizza joint takes care of our needs. They always have pepperoni pizza in stock for $5. Amazing. They also offer cheese pizza. My favorite is the 3-Meat Pizza. They also give free cookies. They give out hot pepper flakes, but no Parmesan cheese. Our 2 pizzas rang up to $14 and change."}
{"text":"I was a bit wary coming into this location since I read about the long wait times but still took the chance.   No problems here though. I was in and out within a minute. Pizza was hot and fresh. Plus the young gentleman was very polite and friendly. Hopefully I keep on having good experiences so I don't have to post anything negative."}
{"text":"Told me ten minutes has been twenty- still waiting for hot and ready pizzas. Really disappointing! Don't tell me ten minutes and not come through I have students waiting on these with a scheduled lunch time!!!"}
{"text":"They won't have anything hot and ready. Slow everything. Save your receipt, because they won't remember your order. Check your order before leaving. Expect to wait 30 minutes for anything.  Seriously, I wish I could give them negative stars. Just the worst."}
{"text":"I have visited this location a few times, and service has usually been decent.  Except for today, the posted hours show that the restaurant opens at 1030 am.  Myself and multiple other customers showed up at 1050 and the door was still locked.  Everything was on in side the store, i.e. menu, lights, etc, just there was nobody in sight within the store...... Strange!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend went here to get some Italian Cheese Bread and crazy bread on Dec. 23. I waited out in front of the store in our car. My boyfriend was the second customer there, followed by 5+ other customers who wanted hot and ready pizzas, which were not even ready. He was the second to the last person to get his order. The employees gave him free wings because he had to wait so long (30+ mins) He and I are vegetarians, so we did not see the point in the wings (which we threw away). When he and I got home, there was broken black plastic on top of my Italian cheese bread. I didn't care at first, 'cause I was so hungry. I took it off and ate the bread. The next day, my boyfriend and I started feeling whoozy and weird. He had diarrhea and I had kept throwing up what tasted like the Italian Cheese Bread's oil. I had a fever of 102 the next day and I had to leave work because I just couldn't stop puking the oil. We are never ever going to any Little Caesar's ever again, especially this location."}
{"text":"everytime i come in for a hot and ready they never are ready. right now 7 people waiting for a pizza, said mine would take 5 mins 10 mins ago."}
{"text":"Cheap pizza. It is best if you are able to get the pizza straight out of the oven. They have the $5 hot and ready pizzas. This location seems to be out of ready pizzas every time that I go in. They generally can have more made up in ten minutes or so, so it isn't too bad."}
{"text":"So I want to start off by saying I don't know why there's crappy reviews on here because my first experience was nothing less than amazing. A big thank you to Baneshia and Joseph for the excellent quality food fresh hot out of the oven, and made just the way I want. Customer service is on point, I wanna personally thank you for being kind friendly and personable and helped me very quickly. Mention I called in my order but it was ready when I got there even sooner. So thank you, keep doing you and god bless you, most Little cesears have went way downhill this one is definitely not one of them!!! Thanks so much, made my shirt as heck 25 min lunch where I can actually enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Very friendly place!  Honest people.  My wife dropped her credit card in the parking lot.  Employee found, remembered her name.  Tried to look up phone number to let her know he had found it.  When he could not find a phone number he looked up address and hand delivered card on his own time!  What a awesome guy!  Stopping by to thank again today!"}
{"text":"I'm just gonna come out and say it. The pizza here sucks. Don't get me wrong, I have had pizza here before, and I wasn't expecting anything amazing, just edible! I tried to order the new pretzel crust pizza and get different toppings than just pepperoni and they said I couldn't. Wtf. I've never heard of a pizza place where you can't add your own toppings. This to me means that the pizza was already premade. Strike 1. I didn't like the pretzel crust pizza at all. Besides the fact that it was cold, there was just no flavor. The pretzel crust leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't really taste pretzely. There was hardly any nacho cheese on the pizza at all. It was just an all around fail. Strike 2. I ordered crazy bread and sauce, which I normally really like, and they were both cold. Strike 3. When we got to the store, we were ignored for about 5 minutes. No one was even paying attention to the customers that were lined up at the front, they were just fooling around in the back. We were about to leave because they didn't even acknowledge us. The sad part is that they have an open kitchen so we can see and hear everything. Strike 4. Shitty services, gross pizza. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hot n Ready Pizza is what you want?  Little Caesars guarantees the $5 hot n ready pizzas, but when we visited this location the pizzas were neither hot nor ready- wait was \"8-15 minutes\".  No thanks."}
{"text":"This little caesars is fast and efficient. There was a prob for awhile with the guy who cuts the pizzas not cutting them thoroughly & for many times. But it seems to have fixed. The owner is a nice friendly guy. Pleasant to do business with. Great location. Convenient location."}
{"text":"I asked what was \"hot & ready\", he pointed to a stack of pizzas in the warmer & said \"pepperoni & crazy bread\".  Great! I ordered 2 pepperoni pizzas & 2 crazy bread. It wasn't ready. I was told it would be a minute for another crazy bread. It wasn't a minute.  I don't want to sound grumpy, but by asking what is hot & ready, I'm looking to avoid a wait.   Had I not already paid, I would have left."}
{"text":"Pizza was fire  but wtf is up with the crazy bread! Didn't even BOTHER to put any effort into making one of the most essential sides of the pizza experience. The bread was not cut all the way and there was barley any cheese. We ate them all but they weren't even that bomb  But I guess you get what you pay for ? puras mamadas alv."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for two and one half years. I never used to have any problems with this location. The past five times I have tried to get a quick pizza, there has been a full lobby, a lengthy wait and it has been extremely understaffed. Today I waited 30 minutes for a basic pizza. \"Hot n Ready\" definitely does NOT apply to this location."}
{"text":"Pizza is good and it was fast! The cashier Jasmine was so friendly and accommodated all of our crazy picky needs she was wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"We've been goin to this location for a few years and it's gotten really bad lately.. today they gave me a barely room temperature pizza so I asked for a different one and it wasn't much better.. then they gave me what looks like a used marinara sauce for he breadsticks which weren't warm either.. the sauce was 1/3 of the way full.. decided not to even use it just Incase it was the leftover sauce of one of the employees from lunch.. Wish this location wasn't so bad now."}
{"text":"Been here only a handful of times. Go to get hot and ready pizzas and there are no hot and ready pizzas we have to wait. We were not there after a rush or during peak times they just don't have them ready. Need to have a little more preparation before hand. But 5$ pizzas can't beat that"}
{"text":"First of all, this place isn't as busy as it looks. The staff is beyond slow and doesn't know the Concept of a \"fast pace\" environment. Every time I got there everyone's short, beyond rude, and doesn't know how to talk to a customer. There was this one time, I order bread sticks. And I said \"with the sauce\" the kid in the front charged me for for each item and a individual price when it cleaner said in the menu above him 3$ for the crazy bread combo.  They don't know common sense and it seems like that's about the only job that they'll ever get. They need to learn how to work in a working environment ASAP."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative 100 stars.  This is by far the saddest excuse for a food establishment in the world.  If you order something and they say 15 minutes, do yourself a favor and come in about 45 minutes later because that's probably how long it will take.  I probably been to this place a dozen times and I've never had them make my food even close to how long they say it takes. Hot and ready doesn't exist here because they never have anything hot and they never have anything ready.  They really need to do something about this location because it is a disgrace to Little Caesars.  I came in here one time and saw an employee playing on his cell phone and then directly touching the pizza.   Gross.   I hate this place more than this review can convey.   Avoid it here if at all possible."}
{"text":"It's Little Ceasers, you know what you're getting when it comes to the Food. However, the staff & personnel at this location are Always friendly, accommodating, and serve with urgency. I am here 1-2 times per week. They are all Nice, every time. I recommend placing a spot on the Credit Card receipt to allow \"TIP\".  This crew would definitely receive $1- $2 from me each visit. They work hard, always smile, encourage me to return. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Ok. So I'm aware that the hot and ready's are cheap. And normally our pizza is super decent. However tonight we went in and got Stuffed crust and you have to be kidding me. This is what I got!! Seriously? Where did the cheese go and why is the pepperoni on one side and burnt. Did it get stuck on the tilt a whirl?? Luckily my kids are garbage disposals because that's what this was. Garbage."}
{"text":"\"Hot and ready\" is a joke, but even more so on busy days (football Sunday/probably weekends in general). Unprofessional staff that doesn't know how to monitor and call out orders correctly. We watched as people who came waaay after us get their large orders before we did. It was ridiculous since we ordered one thing. The young lady tried to lie saying she called my name, probably to cover herself up in front of her manager next to her. Funny thing is we never left the waiting area, and no name sounded anything close to mine. Only gave two stars because the pizza is good for the value."}
{"text":"standard Little Ceasar's pizza.  Even though the address is on Southern, the store is on the Mesa Drive side of the shopping center."}
{"text":"I love LC but this location always has issues. I call ahead and still wait 30 minutes. The employees are constantly bickering and it seems like it's always a new cashier who isn't quite sure what they are doing. Pay in cash and they look at you like you're from Mars. If you want a hot and ready good luck because they never have any ready.."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Cheap, fast, friendly.  Their pizza tastes much better than it used to years ago, and I am absolutely in love with their Italian cheese bread.  Never had a problem here, but it can get busy during their Hot 'n' Ready hours (basically, after 5pm/dinner rush).  Protip: if you DO want Italian cheese bread, call ahead and order unless you want to wait around for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Little Caesar's Pizza...it's great for what it is. This review will be based more so on my customer service experience rather than quality of pizza.  I called twice to Little Caesar's Pizza 20 minutes prior to my arrival. I ordered 2 large pepperoni and mushroom pizzas, 2 bags of crazy bread & one order of crazy sauce. I was quoted $14.00+ total. About 1 minute later, I called to add another order of a large supreme. I was reassured it would be added to my order. Upon arrival, Rachel C who was at the register (not sure if she was the manager that night...but her uniform was different from the other employees.) she told me that my order was not found and told me that I probably called a different location. I started to get frustrated and let them know the number I called which was the same location. She then found my order, but to my surprise the large supreme was not included and she told me that I never called a second time to place the order. I showed her my phone and she apologized but told me it would take another 10 minutes to get it cooked. I held my cool and said you know what, that's fine...go ahead I'll wait the extra 10 minutes. All in all I didn't appreciate them trying to cover up a mistake, and especially didn't like that they didn't offer to compensate me anything for the in inconvenience...not even extra sauce or a bag of crazy bread. But that's fine, I didn't want to make it a big deal for freebies...the point was they didn't seem apologetic. All in all, it is what it is. It's a fast food pizza joint...cheap eats with decent to good pizza for the price. I can't really expect much...but at least to acknowledge the customer would have been nice. I probably will be back...not anytime soon though."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone here,  I've gotten ok pizza for a cheap as it is.  However seeing how they don't get simple orders right,  are not organized especially when busy and get home to a pizza that's lacking toppings and not cut is disappointing to say the least.  The attitudes of the employees at the registers is annoying to be nice about it.  Apparently no one had taught them customer service."}
{"text":"Kaboom   You've seen the commercials. You've heard the pitch. $5 hot and ready pizza.  And let me tell you, they aren't fucking around. I had barely placed the order when like a magician from down low he produced a fresh 'hot and ready pizza' Even now, I'm genuinely impressed with the quality of the pizza, the cleanliness of the store and the enthusiasm of the staff. If you're hungry, and just want to get it in, here's your place.  Why the missing star?  When I look down on a pizza, I don't want to see bread bubbles or red sauce. I want to see a roof of cheese and toppings over an evenly laid out crust.  *there was a generous amount of pepperonis  Keep in mind, I'm an asshole. But I know what I like. And air and sauce, isn't pizza.  Ps-keep in mind, I didn't actually have a slice. I just picked off some of the pepperonis and then shared it with a friend.  pps-if you're going to make a 'deep-dish' pizza, there needs to be something deep about the dish. An inch and half of bread, is not pizza. It's literally bread. I can go to Panera if I want that.   In closing, when game days comes: you'd be rewarded and satisfied with this spot."}
{"text":"It's an average pizza  joint.  Nothing special, it works in a pinch, asked for a cup of water and the girl at the counter had to ask her manager if she could give me a cup of water.   The manager said no!!! They don't even sell water !!WTF !! In Arizona you can't get tap water for a paying customer ?? No more little Caesars for me!!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this place before and am new to the area. I hadn't had pizza since since going vegan about 8 months ago and had a craving for pizza that I finally broke down and gave into (not the meat though, just the cheese. Dogs get the meat). They didn't have delivery but were close to my home, so I decided to give them a shot. I called and ordered a large deep dish pepperoni pizza. The girl said it would be ready in 10 minutes. I said \"wow! Ten minutes? That's fast!\" So I get there about 15 minutes later, just in case they're busy and need a few extra minutes. I walk in and the place is empty. I see people working in the back so I stand and wait. The girl finally sees me and I tell her my name and what I had ordered for take-out. She says, \"It's going to be about 10 minutes. She forgot to throw it in the oven.\"  REALLY????  But she offers me a free bottle of soda, so I wait.  While I'm standing there I see that they have a drive through window. Cool. I also notice that their specialty is to-go pizzas, and they are making them in mass! They're stacked up in mega piles in the cooking area! And the to-go pizzas (aka \"Hot n Ready\") are only $5 each. My large deep dish and two small garlic butter sauces was about $10, and I ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get it.  I must say, the place was clean, and the girl made things right by offering the free bottle of soda.  When I finally got to eat some of my pizza it was pretty good. The crust was really thick (probably too thick) and there was an adequate amount of sauce and cheese but the sauce was a bit acidic/tangy, and they scrimped on the pepperoni. My dogs would have liked more pepperoni.  All in all it wasn't bad for the price. But I wouldn't recommend the buttery garlic dipping sauce. Too strong and gave me heartburn for the next couple days! Icky.  If you want average tasting pizza for a great price, this place isn't too bad. But I would recommend just doing the drive through and order a couple Hot n Readys! I think the regular crust would be better also. And how can you beat the price?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered bread sticks krazy bread and they made him wait because ofcourse they don't have it ready AGAIN. So he waited and he got his food when he got home and we're getting ready to eat. The breads are not even cook right or should i say not even cooked at all most likely. This place is terrible!!! I suggest to everyone to not go to this location!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas wings and a 2 litter soda had to wait 30 min which I wasn't mad I knew they were busy so I grabbed the 2 litter and took it to my car when I came back the manager said I had stole the soda I was told the cashier didn't charge me that was not my fault I offered to pay for it we get home and the pizzas where terrible I called the manager the next day I got offered to replace my whole meal but I never went back I'm not looking for handouts just don't accuse your customers of stealing on mistakes of your employees never going back"}
{"text":"When I picked up a pizza a regular 5 dollar pizza it took them thirty minutes to just the get one pizza. I ended up having to tell them that I wanted to have my money returned. When I get my pizza on there menu its rather barley cheese. And sometimes so much tomato sauce that it makes the cheese slide off once I take a bit out of it."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible, this place normally takes calls before it is open. This time around I called the day before to place a call for 10 pizzas so they'd be ready by the time I get there. No answer, and it is 8pm at this time. The next morning the day I need them for, I call before the business is open several times and nothing. I get there, order my pizzas and they give me this frustrated look because it's so many, and they don't have change for $100. I get a nasty attitude on the matter that I need them now. I was willing to wait because I obviously didn't call ahead, but the attitude was not necessary."}
{"text":"What with growing up in Michigan, Little Caesars has been in my life as long as I can remember. For most of that time, it was a leading chain, right up there with Pizza Hut and Dominos. I remember when they called their product \"Pizza! Pizza!\" because you got two rectangular pizzas in a paper sheath. And boy do I remember when Crazy Bread came out. By then I was living in Texas. Several times a week I would call up to order a sack of CB right before I left work... only stopping this habit when the staff started recognizing my voice, and I decided I needed a carbohydrate intervention.  But these days I associate Little Caesars with ghetto-looking orange-y storefronts and a product that's more about putting a $5 pizza in your hands right now than taking any pride in creating something good. I admit that sometimes, driving home from work, I've been lured in by the promise of \"hot and ready\"... and I still have that love of carbs.... and cheese. Mmmm. It sounds like such a good idea.  And sometimes it is a good idea. Sometimes the pizza and crazy bread are just the ticket for cheap, easy food. Nothing you can be proud of, but weak moments happen to the best of us.  But too often the pizza has a layer of oil sitting on top of it, and the crazy bread is like packing materials sprayed with butter-scented cooking spray.  The location at Rainbow/Tropicana feels grim. Panhandlers sometimes sit near the store. The parking lot is poorly designed. The inside of the store could use a brightening paint job.  But, it's no more grim than any other Little Caesars I've been to in Las Vegas. Maybe Las Vegas just doesn't bring out the best of LC, but I've never been to a location that didn't make me feel like I was sidling into a methadone clinic. (Unless methadone clinics are really nice, with plush armchairs and cheerful posters? I have no idea. My love of bread and cheese is so great that I've never even considered heroin.)  I used to come to this location a half dozen times a year, and the staff (never the same) was always nice. After a long absence, I went back last month got the same friendly service, but food-wise the gamble didn't turn out well. And that's when I thought, \"There is no day bad enough or lazy enough to risk facing this crap again.\"  Little Caesars is fine if you're looking to feed a lot of people with low expectations for a cheap price. I'm just one person, and I'm getting kind of snobby in my old age, and I think I'm too frugal to risk tossing my money (or my cookies) to come back any more."}
{"text":"Two Strikes and you are OUT!  Strike 1: A couple of months (?) ago I placed an order by phone for pickup at this same location. When I arrived they had NO idea what I was talking about. They apologized, placed my order and told me my next time will be for free. I gave them my name, they wrote it into a book and told me to mention this next time and to show my license and everything would be good. Strike 2: Today I called to place my order. I got a busy signal for 10 minutes (which should have been a sign) and just decided to go down to the store to place my order. I told the cashier my situation and he called someone else over who looked like she would rather be ANYWHERE but there at that moment. I repeated my story, she asked when I came in (could not remember) and my name so she could look it up in their system. I told her it was written down but she said it would be in the computer. While she was looking me up, I asked the cashier to place my order.....again.... to get the ball rolling so I wouldn't have to wait even longer, which he thought was a good idea and did so. Eventually the woman came back and told me I was not in there and that there was nothing she could do. I told her you guys have screwed up twice now and I wanted to speak to the manager. The manager came over and told me the same thing and that unless I could tell her the day I came in and/or showed a receipt, she could do nothing. I told her I had neither because the manager (who the original girl told me \"There is no manager\", like that was the important part! I told her then whoever was in CHARGE) all I need was to show my license. It was like a light went on over their heads! The manager/supervisor/leader/grand poo-bah/whatever told the girl to get my license and write my info down. At this point I am super glad that I got my order in before all of this. Eventually she was done I was then waiting........again......for my order. So while she was texting on her phone, I asked the cashier if he could check on my order. Once again, he thought that might be a good idea....he went and checked. Still wasn't up front yet, I guess they had to go find it! Eventually I got my order. I got very short and curt answers from the leader/ president/ king/whatever she was , from the original girl who wanted to be anywhere but there & had a confrontational attitude with a look on her face to match, and all I wanted to do was call in my order and pickup my complimentary pizza after a long day of work. Well, I did eventually get my order............ TWENTY FIVE minutes later. I know in baseball you get three strikes and then you are out. But I don't think I will be stupid enough to take that third swing!"}
{"text":"We go too this location all the timeabd its fine.  We always call ahead because my son doesn't like sauce.   The one time they screwed up and we had to wait,  they gave us 2 orders of Italian cheese bread to make up for our trouble."}
{"text":"This place has screwed up or order so many times.  Then last night they gave us the weirdest looking breadsticks...  not sure what is going on with this place."}
{"text":"NO ZERO. STARS ?????  Worst pizza place u can ever go to, never going back to that place again.  I ordered a hawaiian. First my pizza it  was not  cook all the way, and second the only put ham and pineapple in the middle i wish i would it check the pizza before i left that place."}
{"text":"Great pizza for kids. My son loves eating this pizza. What do you expect he is 10. At least the pizza is fresh because of the long wait"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from a delivery pizza place since I'm a teacher and cannot leave school. Due to their unreliability, I was out 6 pizzas and had 20 kids waiting for food! I called Little Caesar's and they made the pizzas for me right away. Not only were they there for that, they listened to my frazzled mind and listened to me vent. Best customer service I could have asked for today. Thank you!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is so close to my kids school and home,so it's very convenient for when  I don't have time to cook or have to grab something quick ..but never mind any more they never have the  hot and ready any more..if  I only had 10 mins to wait for pizza I would be here..."}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza over the phone said 15 mins arrived to the location 5 minutes earlier while waiting after checking in I saw people pay and get their pizza that moment I ordered one pizza. And had to wait an addiction 25 minutes after arriving. Not happy not impressed will never return."}
{"text":"97 degrees inside this store. It shouldn't even be legal to allow those employees to work in there all day. Somebody needs to get that fixed ASAP."}
{"text":"RUDE! We recently moved to the area and I needed to order 7 pizzas for pick up. When I got to the store to pick up my pizza they were not fresh and the girl chucked the pizzas to her coworker as if she could careless. Got offered no napkins or cheese and peppers! Poor customer service"}
{"text":"Slow! REALLY??? It's 5pm....why would you not have ANYTHING ready!!?? That's why people come here! To get it F A S T!!! Your pizza is of the lowest quality, but its convienent so the working class can come in, grab a couple pies, & leave in 2 or 3 minutes. Its 5pm, you have 2 customers, yet we all have to WAIT ON PIZZA??? Last time I come here! If I'm gonna wait on a pie, it will be anywhere but here!!!"}
{"text":"Always a delight getting pizza here on a regular night or Friday night. The service is excellent with the management of the store, you usually only have to walk in and they'll tell you what's available for your needs!"}
{"text":"The last three times I came, they didn't have the lunch combos ready even though there is a sign that says \"No Calling, No Waiting, Hot and Ready Lunch.\"  Other than that the pizza is delicious and the crazy bread is amazing."}
{"text":"I believe Little Caesars are good for one thing, and one thing only! Cheap Pizza! I don't think I have ever ordered anything else from their menu, so I can't say anything negative about it.  We usually get the $5 dollar Pepperoni pizza, this time we also got the cheese one. It is nothing spectacular, it taste like pizza, it is what it is! What I like about this location it's that they have a drive-thru, and this night in particular, the young man that helped us was very friendly and... well, helpful! Good experience."}
{"text":"This place is pathetic. Pizza is never ready and always takes 25-30 mins to make. Not worth it! The kids that work here dont give a crap and its reflected in their service to customers. This little caesars is absolutely awful."}
{"text":"It took 15 minutes for one pizza and one of the black females was slamming down pizza orders, breads and sauces on the counter, not making eye contact and being extremely passive aggressive and rude to every single person waiting there, including myself. What an awful experience."}
{"text":"Every time I go to a Little Caesars, it's the same ordeal. Unhappy employees, minimal to no eye contact and never a smile or hello! I walked into this place and the manager looked at me without any greeting.   You should really learn to pick up talent that are happy to work. Also make a happier environment for your workers. Your employees are just as important as your customers."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the \"hot n ready\" I would never even frequent this place. You cant find a better deal to feed 3 kids pizza and bread sticks for $8 and left overs. If you have low expectations you wont be dissappointed. Pizza-Pizza. Thanks for keeping my addiction going."}
{"text":"Called and placed an order to pick up and was told 10 mins. Sat outside in my car and ten minutes later went in to find out they never placed my order. I was told another 8 mins to get it started. Waited another 10 minutes until they had my order ready.  I expressed my disappointment with the situation and of course the clerk had zero remorse as she could care less what I thought. She told me that the manager must have taken the order and he's in the back that's why they didn't know!!!!!! That's a terrible excuse, they could have offered me a free dip or a discount for wasting my valuable time, but instead they just showed zero interest in keeping my business.   This is not the first time this type of error has happened here, I won't be returning again. They have a bunch of kids working here with no sense of what customer service means."}
{"text":"The service at this location is extremely poor. On June 18, 2018. I witnessed a heavily tottoed female employee verbally abuse an elderly customer.  In response to my complaint to head office, the owner made excuses for this employee's poor behaviour. The owner became so rude and belligerent to me during the call that I had to threaten to call the police if I ever heard from him again. The owner also confirmed and condoned this employee serving an undercooked Hawaiian pizza to the elderly customer. My husband has also had multiple poor experiences with this employee. A definite DNR (do not return)."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Called at 4pm I was told that my order would be ready in 15-20 minutes I get there about 30 minutes later and the order was not ready. So I was waiting for another 25 minutes. This location is sucks. They are always behind and never have anything ready even if you call ahead of time."}
{"text":"Ask for just two fresh crazy breads to go...no hard right? Just bake two fresh orders of bread...why did I get one fresh and one burnt as hell. Then I called and the girl on the phone says they can give me one more fresh one...but wouldn't refund my money....I told then during my order that I was getting this for a pregnant lady....do you think I can come home to a pregnant lady with the order not right...what a half ass pizza parlor....such a shame I couldnt even get hot bread for this pregnant lady...how dare these people."}
{"text":"They have a pretty straight forward menu. I think you can customize your pizza if you like.   Pepperoni & cheese pizzas are always ready to go for $5. Sometimes they do run out & you have to wait a bit. If you order different pizzas like sausage or supreme you do have to wait a bit. Also they have crazy bread (bread sticks) & wings ready. There is 8 wings in a box and you can tell them what sauce you like and they will add the sauce & mix the wings with it. I like the mild sauce. The crazy bread is good when it's fresh, you can taste the butter on them & they are really soft & doughy. Their Italian cheese bread is delicious one of my favorites. Also make sure you ask for marinara sauce.   Also they have a great deal for lunch. For $5 you get a deep dish pizza with for slices I believe it's pepperoni only.   Also they sell ranch .59 for one or 2 for $1."}
{"text":"I feel that pizza is very subjective between the major chains.  All very good and everyone has their personal tastes.  Little Caesars is my favourite!  And for $5.49 for a medium, one topping pizza is an awesome deal!  I've been ordering from this location since I moved to Stouffville about 4 years ago and they're always friendly and quick!  Always!  My orders are always ready in less than 15 min and the pizza is always consistently good.  Love the service, love the pizza, and I love the location!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed In the lack of customer service. We called in an order on what was expected to be a busy for the knowingly slow establishment. Called in the order at 5:45 pm for a 6:45 pm pick up. At 7:30 I had to demand my order. After watching walk in orders be fulfilled prior to my call in. You get what you pay for by way of customer service. I am only grading one star because the application requires at least 1."}
{"text":"We ordered in advance ad still had to wait to pick up our pizza.... only to be disappointed. We ordered 3 meat, almost needed a magnifying glass to see the meats! Bad service. Not enough help and the management must be on vacation ! Customers walking out because this establishment does not employ enough help."}
{"text":"A bit disappointing to wait 10 minutes for a \"Hot-N-Ready\" Lunch Combo at 1 pm.  I was not alone, 4 others came in for items all of which are allegedly ready and had the same10 minute wait."}
{"text":"This location is a disgrace to the Little Caesar's brand. It used to be better managed but now it's a bunch of kids and no real management. Dominique horse playing punching on the curly head kid saying she don't like certain words while saying it out loud for all of us to hear, trash on the floor throughout the back, trash cans overflowing near food and more. I had 20-25 minutes to observe exactly why they were giving estimations of 20-25 minutes to everyone because they supposedly ran out of sauce. GET IT TOGETHER! Surely the health district will be contacted for this one."}
{"text":"Holy SHIT. The only reason I am giving this 1 star is because there's no option for burn this place down.   Tonight my recipe says 9:17 I placed my order but let me tell you that is not where my order started.   I originally arrived at this fine establishment at 8:50.  I sat at the drive through behind a truck until 9:05 because, I guess hot and ready is not so ready.   After waiting all that time we pull up I order the following.... A pretzel crust pizza with the 3 meats on it, an order of wings with 2 blue cheeses, then an additional regular cheese pizza.... the person taking my order says it will be 7 monutes, I say that's fine , she I guess puts in the order, it took her 3 minutes to tell me it was $29.....I give her $30 then another 3 minutes later she hands me my recipe and one dollar.  I look at the recipe she charged me for everything above but billed me for a pretzel pizza and a separate 3 meat.  I say... excuse me you made a mistake she asked what was wrong I tell her I wanted the 3 meats on the pretzel pizza, not a separate pizza, she says hold on, she then takes another 5 minutes doing god knows what inside, comes back and asks me for the dollar back...so I give it to her scratching my head....why are you asking me for the dollar back, how about you write $1 on a piece of paper and pretend so it's not that difficult for you....this is what I'm thinking... then she emerges with $10 and change and handed me a piece of paper to sign my name saying she had to do a full exchange...I ask her was it the math that you couldn't do?  And as I look down the new recipe says the time 9:17...and she prompted me to pull around to the front,  My husband and I are sitting in the car waiting ...thinking like every other drive through they are going to bring it out to us....but nope...in the process of waiting, they have had friends in and out, a little kid the cook kept coming out picking up and throwing around playing with in the store, a band of ghetto people in the back of the building hanging out the back door with the workers, I mean it was like every degenerate of the worst neighborhood was there hanging out with the workers like it was a party and not a work place.  Finally at 945 my husband walks in, pissed because we have been waiting for ever patiently while the whole ghetto has been hanging out, when he walks in the worker jasmine hands my husband 2 pizzas (the cheese one burnt where all cheese and sauce were dried and theee is nothing but a sea of black crust bubbles all over the top and the pretzel under cooked) and 2 blue cheeses, so my husband stands there waiting and she is like...what, he says the wings, she says uh oh well I voided them out, he sys...REALLY well fine I guess just make them as he's shaking his head. She says, in her finest ebonics ghetto talk...well yous gonna ha ta pay fow dem. He again says REALLY? I mean really you couldn't figure out something was wrong when you put 2 blue cheese containers on pizza boxes ....she said well like I say yous gonna ha ta  pay.  He says forget it ND comes back in the car, so I tell him I specifically came for wings, not pizza like the rest of the family so I star walking to the door and they are making fun and laughing at my husband. Now this made me see red. So I walk on there, and I right off the bat say don't stand here and make fun of my husband when you get paid minimum wage and can even do that right. The girl, JASMINE says while she is wiggling her neck ..don't you come in here talking to me that way, and tells the girl behind her who is texting yo girrr, you gotta hold ma keys , like she's gonna come and attack me. So at this point I'm standing there and I say you know what ...what's your name, she says, is jasmine, yo Wan my last name to boo, it's aught you can tell my manager I don't give a f**k, you can tell who you wan......the whole time mocking me smiling and trying to act all cute and smart assy i say ok i will ghetto boo mocking her usage of the word boo and so I type in her name and as I'm walking out the cook is opening the door for me , and leaning in my face really close, saying inaudible stuff in a sexual manner.   I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE ENCOUNTERED A MORE UNEDUCATED, GHETTO, CONFRONTATIONAL, GROUP OF WORKS IN MY LIFE.   TECHNICALLY THE COOK ENGAGED IN SEXUAL HASSMENT BRING IN MY PERSONAL SPACE AND THE JASMINE BI**H TECHNICALLY THREATENED ME.    I WILL NEVER EVER GO TO LITTER CEASARS AGAIN...THEY OBVIOUSLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR COMPANY HIRING PIECES OF GHETTO TRASH LIKE THESE ANIMALS"}
{"text":"I wish i could give less then 1 star the service there tonight was horrible the told me 15 minutes for my order it took over 30 minutes there is soooooo much garlic on my cheese bread we could not eat it and the pizza was so thin when you tried to pick it up it fell to pieces  it makes since why this location only has 1 and a half star rating i have been going to this place for years and its usually great after tonight i will not return to this location"}
{"text":"Undecided for lunch so decided to go grab a hot and ready lunch combo. There was one other customer in there sitting. I paid and was told it would be about 10 min. How convenient. I only get a half hour lunch since I work from home. Hot and ready means they should have product ready when you walk in the door, not make and cook it once it's ordered. Sorry Little Caesars, never again."}
{"text":"These guys are great when you are in a rush.  Its cost effective and fast.  Now i like pizza, and usually i like to pick whats on there but hey, when you dont have time, just grab one of their ready to go pies and your golden.  But this time i tried these new Cinnamon sticks they had.  Ugh oh my, they were pretty good.  Best $4 add-on i have had in a long time.  So i have been here many times and will be back many more.  Its great for something fast and tasty, and nothing beats cold pizza for breakfast, because i cant eat an entire pie by myself."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The hot and ready is a lie. Nothing is ever hot and ready! You are stuck waiting in a sauna for 30+ minutes just for a cheese pizza. Even when you call in an order and show up when directed you are still waiting forever. Save yourself the time and go somewhere better."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but Service was slow and rude. They had everyone else's pizza ready but I had to wait 15-20 mins for a deep dish. Someone came and gone with the same exact order before mine. Gave excuses of short staff but couldn't give an estimated time on my order."}
{"text":"Such a horrible location. Every time I call to order ahead of time and then go to pick it up on time, they tell me they gave away my order to someone else and I have to wait for them to remake it. Literally every single time. What's the point in calling ahead? Hire people with common sense, or at least past work experience."}
{"text":"Well I went here for crazy bread. First it was 10:50am so 20 minutes after they opened. They had 1 crazy bread, 2 pizzas in the warmer. They Pizza were in different Kind of boxes so I believe they were different kinds of pizza.  So I had to wait about 7 minutes for my crazy bread. Then as I left a lady when in to order and I noticed that she had to wait for her order. I did also notice that there were 3 guys in back just joking around. I would think that with lunch time coming up they would be making stuff for the lunch crowd. But that's me. Maybe they don't have a lunch rush. The lady that waiting on me was very helpful and seam to be very friendly. The store was clean and everything appeared stocked up in the front of the store."}
{"text":"I eat here often. The pizza is good. The service is great. The price is awesome. A special shout-out to Aleshia. Always friendly. Always a big smile. Thanks for making my pizza well done. :)"}
{"text":"Don't advertise hot-n-ready if you can't have it ready. Just be honest. Order and wait 15 minutes. Slower than dominos."}
{"text":"So this is the 2nd time I've tried this place on a Saturday night after church.    Each time, there has been a wait for the \"hot and ready\" pizzas.  The wait of 20 minutes for a cheap pizza isn't worth it. How can \"hot and ready\" be your main marketing point and them not be ready.  Do yourself a favor, drive a mile north to US Pizza and get a large for 6.99 with better ingredients and definitely better tasting....the wait is usually 15 minutes there.   I'm actually there now...I should've known better."}
{"text":"I was not a big fan of Little Caesars until they started offering their $6 extra pepperoni and extra cheese pizza. Previously when I would get one of their $5 pepperoni pizzas, I didn't get enough pepperoni. Adding more pepperoni and cheese made all the difference for me. In addition, I have decided that I am particularly fond of their pizza crust. The crust has a very excellent texture, and it is consistently good."}
{"text":"25 minutes for a large pizza at 6pm on a Thursday. Its just not acceptable. What happened to their \"hot n ready\". Nothing is ever ready at this location."}
{"text":"Good place to go to pick up a quick dinner.  There's usually a wait for breadsticks- but it's cheaper than even going to McDonalds!  The pizza isn't amazing- but it's okay for $5!"}
{"text":"One star is a nice review. If they had a negative that's what it would be. These people are just flat out rude. I ordered a pizza and have ordered several threw them to give them benefit of the doubt. Nope. Turns out they are just terrible and don't know customer service. I live a mile away and will gladly drive 10+ miles to get better service. More so from that I'll never eat at little Caesars Pizza again."}
{"text":"Would have given it a no star but that's not available. I thought the slogan for little caesars pizza was hot and ready!! Try order and wait 30 or more minutes for just regular pepperoni and cheese pizzas. This is what their supposed to be famous for. Unbelievable!! This store is OOC  ( out of control )"}
{"text":"Yeah...it's just pizza. But service with smiles are here too! The African American girl at the cashier is very nice & friendly. Full of smiles while taking your order. Just sayin...."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick pie. Service is always good. It's a $5 pizza and it is decent. The deep dish is as good as any pizza in town and I'm from NY. Great plaza with Kidsignment children's store, BWW, Von's and 808 Sushi."}
{"text":"Being a non meat eater, I am always sure to phone ahead to place orders for take out so they have adequate notice. I tried calling this location several times and no one answered the phone. I had checked out their website and reviewed their vegetarian options and was very happy to see that they accommodate those of us who don't wish to eat mean. However, in their haste to slap together my bland tasting pizza they must not have been paying much attention because I found random pieces of sausage on my veggie pizza. Needless to say I was mortified that I had put meat in my mouth! Sure, it's cheap pizza and my teenaged daughter could really care less about quality, but I do. Perhaps if they actually had \"adults\" working there rather than a bunch of teenagers (I've never seen an adult working any time I've been by there to get pizza for my daughter) they would have better quality control over how the pizzas are being made. Needless to say - I doubt I'll ever eat there again. My daughter, I'm sure will want the random pepperoni pizza, but no thanks, I'll pass. Bad customer service and bad food!"}
{"text":"Pizza is decent for the price. They are always busy for lunch and dinner time. The $5 hot and ready is a great deal. The staff changes regularly but this is typical for the type of restaurant. Pretzel crust is available for hot n ready at five in the evening. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"It's cheap and fast pizza. I love there deep dish pizza. So cheesy and so bad for you. This is the place to go when my kids want pizza, I don't think spending $10+ at other \"good\" pizza spots are worth it for my two and four years old."}
{"text":"This location opened just a few weeks ago and my kids begged to get pizza the third night it ipened. We stopped in for a few pizzas for my big family. The pizza was both hot and ready during the busy dinner hours. It definitely tastes better than it used to. The sauce is tangy, the cheese tastes great and the dough is good-not Papa Johns good, but tastes like it was made fresh and not frozen.  Best of all I can get 3 pizzas for under $20 including tax.  We have stopped by at least 3 times since it opened and it has been consistent each time in quality.  My only complaint is the while the staff is (mostly) all friendly, the seem under trained and under motivated to give fast and engaged service. They seem to not quite know how to speak to customers and even ring people up with efficiency. Hopefully this will improve with time. We hope it stays busy so it will be here for awhile, our family frequently needs a quick dinner!   I would love a lower carb pizza and a salad to be added to the menu also!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I remind myself why I don't come back!  It's very unorganized and chaotic EVERYTIME!  I personally don't think it's the staff as they seems stressed and frazzled.  I think they need more help in terms of staffing.  Management needs to step in here in my opinion."}
{"text":"Still the worst. I decided to try and see if maybe they improved over time. I was sadly mistaken. The pizza looked like someone just threw it into the box without care. Plus they are making the size of the pizza smaller now! The texture of the crust was comparable to cardboard. It made me sick, again! I also got crazy bread. It was really flavorful, but super oily! Just completely drenched in oil, it was gross. Plus the girl was packaging them and dropped one on the floor. She didn't even offer to make a new bag, I just lost one stick of bread that I paid for. It was also super hot in there, I don't know how the workers don't die from a heat stroke. They got a small renovation up front I noticed. The girl had a huge stain on her shorts and looked like she needed a shower. This place is completely ridiculous. It's like a joke for a business. Is it really that hard to have some quality behind your brand? I guess it is... NEVER RETURNING  Feast your eyes on this pizza...search for better."}
{"text":"Don't go here right when they open they seem to have an attitude that they have to make pizza. At least everyone that came in got the same great treatment."}
{"text":"They completely botched my order. I explained it three times. The cashier couldn't get it right no matter how hard I tried. Finally, a manager walked over. Within 30 seconds, my order was taken correctly and for the inconvenience my pizza was given to me for FREE. Now that is customer service done right. Not everyone can control their employees, but they can take responsibility for them. This is exactly what was done. Very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Very fast, courteous service!  The pizza is always good and you can't beat the price if you're feeding a crowd."}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I WOULD! Went to get a pepperoni pizza and there were NONE hot n ready. The girl who worked at the counter was so extremely rude, rolled her eyes at customers and grumpy towards her coworkers."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this location. I walked in and there were several employees in the back I waited 10 minutes for someone to come up front and no one ever came. Some customer service, guess you guys don't want money that's why you're failing."}
{"text":"Let's call it like it is: a guilty pleasure. Awful pizza that is kinda tasty. No hint of authenticity, but cheap and fast (when it's not busy!) just don't actually expect anything actually hot, or actually ready."}
{"text":"The pizza is always hot but the service always sucks at this location. You're always waiting, even for a single cheese pizza. What's the point of having a \"Hot n Ready\" slogan if the food is never ready."}
{"text":"Ordered using their iPhone app. Order was supposed to be ready by 5:04pm today. It is 6:18pm as a write and my order is STILL not ready! Management should have prepared for the biggest sports event in this city- the Mayweather vs. McGregor fight. They weren't even making pizzas in any type of order. We left after being told they had 2 out of 3 pizzas ready and the 3rd would be ready in 20mins. We just called and now we have to wait 20 more mins!"}
{"text":"My family picked up a pepperoni and a cheese pizza and this is what we received. The sad part about it is my husband went into this Little Cesar's to buy the pizza before I decided to check out the reviews for this location. If I would've read the other bad reviews we wouldn't have chosen this location. The pizza dough bubbled all over leaving barely any cheese as you can see on this photo of our CHEESE pizza. I definitely DON'T recommend this location. Where is management with quality control at this location?!? My husband said the kids behind the counter didn't look as if they would even care about their job (no enthusiasm, careless attitude)."}
{"text":"The staff here needs to get a clue how to manage orders. I went in, ordered a 3 meat and a pretzel crust pizza. 5 min, they say. Ok, no problem. It's busy.  15 min later, after everyone who was in there, and everyone who came in after me and ordered,  has gotten their pizzas and left, including a guy who got a nice fresh pretzel pizza fresh out of the oven, I got up and asked about MY order as I figured the Pretzel was what I was waiting for. Oh, what did you order? I restated my order. The kid opens the door and pulls out a 3 meat and a pretzel that have been sitting there since I sat down. Here you go!  It gets better. The 3 meat scans as expired. The other kid says that's OK. I say you are going to serve me an expired pizza? \"oh, no, the tickets are all screwed up\".  Bull$#!+. I get home and the meat pizza is soggy, and the pretzel is too, and not even cut all the way through.  Forget this place. You may get run over in the parking lot anyway, because the idiots who patronize this place don't know how to park, so they all line up along the fire lane and block the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Thanks for reminding me that there is another pizza spot across the street that I actually rather enjoyed before you came along. Thanks for reminding me that just because I frequent different business on that side of the street, that doesn't mean I must remain loyal to you. So I came here on a hot day after a 9 hour shift with not as much as a pee break; last time I want to do was go home and cook. After cashing out the person in front of me, the girl behind the register mumbled something as she proceeded to go to the back and start making pizzas. As I stood there for the next 5 minutes or more, watching her make pizzas with her bare hands that I did not see washed ( yea I should have left on that alone), I was thinking \" Would have been nice if she had asked what I wanted and taken this $5 bill in my hand for a box of already made pizza ( that I was hoping she didn't personally make).\" As I watched her coworker slice ( again ungloved but at least he was just slicing) fresh out of the oven pizza and boxed them, I waited. When he went to put them in the hot and ready station, I decided this was my chance to speak up so that we can exchange cash and food, since he was only 5 steps away from me. It took about 4 \"excuse me\"s for him to even look my way. I asked \" Can I just give you this money and get one of those cheese pizzas you're about to put away?\" His money handling, non hand washing, dough kneading counterpart then CLEARLY spoke up saying \" I'm finishing making other people's orders. You have to wait two minutes!\" I decided it was best to leave as \"hot & ready\" did not necessarily mean \"ready\" even when you are staring straight at it.... And I came to my overworked senses and realized I just wanted pizza, not a side of money- bacteria flavoring."}
{"text":"5$ hot and ready pizza? Can't beat it! My son and I love coming here for a cheap meal! Very clean,polite staff...and you may see a sister wife!"}
{"text":"i went to the Palm Glen location on Glendale, and the so called Hot and Ready wasn't Ready! The  Manager told me it would take around 12 minutes to get a $5.00 Pizza. I asked the Manager is there anything ready? She said a $6.00 Pizza. I said, since there's No $5.00 Hot and Ready to go Pizzas could she allow me to have the $6.00 Pizza at $5.00? She said, No! We can't do that! I say, Keep the Customer Happy, and they  come back! She rather lose a Loyal Customer over a Dollar!"}
{"text":"I personally LOVE little caesar's. The crazy bread is the answer though. Only a dollar, and pure heaven."}
{"text":"Well, I don't normally purchase little Caesar's pizza, but I had to for my wife's class party. I arrive at 10:40 for their \"Hot and Ready\" pizza and wait patiently for 11 minutes while the one person in front of me gets their order in. Yes, 11 minutes for one person's order. It wasn't even a big order, it was one pizza, breadsticks, and a soda... wtf! Okay, okay, okay it my turn... wait, the cashier has started helping someone who came in after me! Grrrrrrr... wait some more... finally I get to order:  Me: one large cheese pizza, please. Cashier: okay, just cheese? Me: yes, that'll be everything. Cashier: okay, would you like a two litre? Me: no just the pizza please, I'm in a hurry. Cashier: okay, would you like to add crazy bread? Me: no just the pizza please. Cashier: okay, would you like to add dipping sauce? Me: NO, seriously just the pizza.  Cashier: okay, $5.44. Me: [pays cashier, receives receipt, waits for \"Hot and Ready\" pizza...] Cashier: can I help you? Did you want to add crazy bread? Me: no, I would like the pizza I just paid for. Cashier: [walks to the back for 3 minutes] Cashier: uuuummmmm... It's going to be about 12 minutes. Me: I didn't pay for a 12 minute pizza, I paid for a \"Hot and Ready\" pizza.  Cashier: ummm, yeah it's not ready, soooo... Me: I need a refund then, the only good thing about little Caesar's is that I shouldn't have to wait for a pizza, your sign literally says, \"HOT AND READY.\" Cashier: [walks to the back for 2 minutes] Cashier: so so you want to wait, it's only 9 minutes now. Me: NO, I need my money back so I can go to pizza hut!  Seriously though, if your only advantage over your competitors is that your pizza is hot AND ready, don't screw it up."}
{"text":"A nice pizza place.  Price is good pizza is not bad quick service.  Wish they had thin crust pizza!"}
{"text":"THe pizza is undercooked and breadsticks always lack flavor. The location on Silverado Ranch is much better! The service was okay but the quality of food is horrible!"}
{"text":"Apparently when they advertise something as \"Hot-N-Ready\" it's not very accurate. I've never had this issue before. I was told it was going to be an 8-10 minute wait for an item that should be stocked \"Hot-N-Ready\" and I said isn't this supposed to be available and she said, \"No.\" I said, \"So your sign is incorrect then?\" She replied, \"Well I guess we don't have them ready.\" I would call ahead just to be safe and save yourself the trouble and headache."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Little Caesar's Pizza since day one! When they came out with their deep dish pizza I was really in love! I know this location has a bad rap for service and quality but I had 0 issues. I called in my order on a Saturday night, my food was ready in 30 minutes, the young male employee was super nice and greeted me right when I came in which is always nice.  My order was spot on: One deep dish pizza with half pepperoni and half sausage and a order of their wings with no sauce. It was accurate and delicious! We did notice that my half of the pizza was way better than my moms, they put a good amount of cheese and sauce on mines but hers was dry :/ The wings are always solid I just wish they made them bigger, it's so easy to eat them all up!  I have no complaints with the service and the product is good! Next time I would just order my pizza with extra sauce and the cheese! Not to mention you get a great deal, one pizza and wings for $17.00!? Most places charges that price for one large pizza not including toppings!   ^__^"}
{"text":"Always have to wait at this place. Whatever that's expected I guess. But when it's 100 plus degrees and the windows face west and have 10 plus's people in there at 6 pm it gets hot!!!! The regular window tinting doesn't keep it remotely comfortable."}
{"text":"You walk in with five dollars. You walk out with a pie that's more nostalgia than substance. You're saving the time of opening your own oven and making your own cardboard-esque Tombstone, and sometimes, that's okay.   Look, sometimes you just want to eat. Sometimes, the kids are cranky and yelling and screaming and breaking lamps, and Calgon can't take that away. Fortunately, Little Caesar's can. It'll feed the kids, they'll have a reasonably acceptable pizza, and you've only spent half of a sawbuck.  I'd never pick it as my favorite, but, as an every-so-often? It's worth the five dollar pie."}
{"text":"Easy in easy out. Yummy pizza & great price!!  Great location off Gilbert & Ocotillo. Basically next door to Fryes if you need anything else."}
{"text":"oh yeah I love this place even if it is hit and miss each time that you go or that they sorta suck at answering their phone."}
{"text":"As soon as I walk in the cashier was playing in the back with the cook.  They were throwing food to each other and playing around.  They look at us and didn't even care and continue playing."}
{"text":"I sent my 9 year old son into the store at 7375 S Durango Las Vegas store and ordered 2 pizzas and bread sticks while I sat in the car right outside the door. My son gave Brett (cashier) $20 bill. Brett told my son to stand to the side and his pizzas would be ready soon. The other cashier had to tell Brett to get my son's pizzas. Brett did. My son came back to the car and had no change. I went back into the store to ask why my son came out with no change. 1st Brett told me he did. I watched the entire event and he NEVER did. He then said \"OH I FORGOT\". He called Alex over and told him he forgot to give me change and needed the register opened. Alex never apologized to me or for that matter even looked at me.  I am very irate about this event. I sent my son in because I was sick and yet I still had to go into the store to clear up the mistake. I took this as stealing from my 9 year old son. UNEXCEPTABLE!"}
{"text":"Went to this little Caesar's on Friday evening ordered my pizza ahead of time cause we like lite sauce girl said 30 to 35 min ok figured they were busy got there and there was a line so I went up front and asked if mine was ready she acted like she didn't know what pizza I was talking bout finally found it it was still in the oven got almost an hr total of when I called there was another woman there who had been waiting 40 min they couldn't find hers ..also the last time I had ordered they forgot to put the pepperoni on our deep dish pepperoni pizza ..this place always seems to have employees running around not knowing what's what with the pizzas that people ordered ..very under staffed ..my biggest complaint is the girl up front with the long hair not tied completely and swinging all over and I know it's not health department code it's gross and would b gross for people to get her hair in there pizza she was the only one who didn't have her hair up if the reason is because she works on the line its not good enough cause she's also around the pizzas"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for feeding the crowd of teenage boys that gathers at our house.  The employees are nice and the food is consistently good.  Wait times have significantly decreased over the years, which is fantastic.  The newly remodeled front counter looks great."}
{"text":"They don't have any hot and ready pizzas at noon!  What is the point?  To add to that the rude old cashier started acting all \"low talker\" on me because she couldn't hear me.  Totally changed her shrill voice to mock an already displeased customer.  Somehow she doesn't do this to the quiet white man that she also couldn't hear while I waited!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Little Caesars. It makes me feel that I have done something wrong with my finances.   I was there getting pizza for my daughter whom had just given birth to my second granddaughter.   I think the pizza is too greasy, the crust has always had a rubbery texture and the cheese is MIA in certain locations of the pizza.   The wing sauce is so watery. The taste profile is so low.   The thing I did like was the cheesy bread sticks."}
{"text":"Between the cursing coming from the cooks and the look of hatred for her job at the register it's no surprise they did not wear name tags."}
{"text":"Always delicious and affordable. Never doing us wrong. No matter what day you are having you can always count on Little Caesars to make your day better. So turn than frown upside down and stop to your nearest Little Caesars."}
{"text":"I went here because I was starving and they advertise Hot 'N Ready Pizza and Crazy Bread.  I got inside and there was one person in line in front of me picking up his order.  I was greeted by the counter guy who said that the Crazy Bread would be 10 minutes.  I decided to wait since I was already there and the Bread is better than the pizza.  I ordered the crazy bread with extra toppings since I had to wait for it anyway.  If it had been ready, I wouldn't have special ordered it.  While I waited, about a dozen people came in and each of them got the same story, \"it will be about 10 minutes\".  So much for Hot 'N Ready.  The counter guy would call his orders back to the cooks and they made snide comments to him back.  This was very unprofessional, especially in front of a dozen customers.  I realize that a little bit of bantering between people is fun and to be expected, but I thought the actual comments made were on the harsh side.  My order came up and it was hot and about 10 mins later.  I had to remind him about the extra toppings, before he gave it to me.  I enjoyed the Crazy Bread very much and ate one piece of the pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the past two months to buy the \"Extra Most Bestest\" pizzas, and each time they were great!  I was thinking that maybe LC's had turned a corner.  This last time, I grabbed one and left, only to discover that upon returning home, the cheese and pepperoni was almost non-existant, on par with a regular \"Hot & Ready\" pizza, if they'd forgotten to add the second half of cheese.  Oh, and the crust was burned.    It was bad.  Dang, LC's!  Do better!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not the problem here, but the service is. I walked into the store and was not greeted. Instead the employees continue chatting about their conversations. When I was about to ask a question, the cashier walked away from the register to make another joke with a fellow employee.   The entire store seems to be run by immature teenagers. The lobby area was not particularly clean either, yet there were more than enough employees there that could maintain it. I gave this review two starts until I witnessed workers eating in the kitchen which is a health code violation. I came in to buy pizza for my employees but I don't think I will be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"The girl that rung me up looked and sounded like she seriously hated her job. I walked in and she looked at me like she was surprised to see a customer walk into her store. She took my order and didn't even ask if I wanted anything else. She literally stared at me until I said \"that's all.\" Horrible service ! Great price for a pizza and wings though."}
{"text":"I ordered two orders of bread sticks and most of them same with sticky black gunk on them. They were uneatable and I am mad that I wasted my money on food I cannot eat."}
{"text":"Love little ceasers regardless of the location. The pizza is good but the most important thing is that it is cheap!!! Best thing to have is the stuffed crazy bread (try it next time won't be disappointed) only real complaint is with the owners and workers at this location. It's hard to understand them (their English is very poor) and they always seem disorganised. The rating I gave is more based on the food it self not that specific location so do keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Worst location I've been to for little Caesars. Waited almost 30 minutes for just two pizzas!"}
{"text":"Went there the past three times snobby attitude having ass dirty ignorant bitches and pizza and breadsticks were raw doe manager said if I don't like it don't come back wow I'm a chef at Benihana so this is a sad excuse of a restaurant or pizzeria they are all ignorant  and don't even know how to bake a pizza I would ice it 0 stars this place is a disgrace never eat here I promise you'll thank me later I got food poisoning and they were smoking weed inside the kitchen"}
{"text":"Not a fan of fast food pizza and hadn't eaten little Cesar's in years. My friend brought me here and was super surprised how good it was. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I feel bad, i use to manage a LC and it was so shit to run, customers are always so fucking stupid and so goddamn rude, the workers took a while to get my order up tonight, but that was expected, how can they keep hot and readys up all the time, when people are coming in with 10 kids feeding them all, yet the GM tells the workers not to over stock hot and readys because if they dont sell in time you have to toss them and it cost them, you know why they jacked the price up on the 5$ pizza? THEY DIDN'T , its the tax you dicks, when i worked there it was 5.41$ and people BITCHED SO MUCH about .41 cents, they would walk out, its 41 fucking cents, take your broke ass somewhere else, the pizza was OK tonight, my hat goes off to the workers, making shit money at a shit job, with a smile on."}
{"text":"The little cutie with braces sure knows how to make my crazy bread! Too bad she doesn't come with the order =("}
{"text":"Being from the Detroit area, Little Caesar's is my kind of pizza...comfort food. Add in the helpful, smiling lady behind the counter, and my visit to Waunakee's  Little Caesars was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  I immediately felt at home!"}
{"text":"It's never \"hot and ready\". Always wait a minimum of 20 mins regardless what time of day I get here for the \"hot and ready\" cheese and pepperoni pizzas"}
{"text":"4th time I've gotten pizza from here that I have had to wait over 30 min for my order to be ready. Twice I called it in an hour before I needed it and still waited 15+ min. They are very nice, but EXTREMELY slow! Won't be back...it's worth the drive to get to a different store."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza of all time! And i sure most families love it too! Got nothing to say about the price and product! Both are excellent! But customer service needs alot of improvement. It doesnt not cost to be a decent human being. Doesnt matter where you work and what do you do :) This will add up to other reviews showing unprofessionalism of the crews. Hopefully theyll take chance to improve!"}
{"text":"I ain't rich.  I'm barely comfortable, what with student loans and the like.  Little Caesars isn't the best pizza in the world - far from it.  However their $5 pepperoni carry-out special paired with the $2 \"Crazy\" bread (and it's definitely crazy) will feed me for a couple of days and it's more edible than Domino's.  (Side rant:  Domino's is a plague upon humanity.  How are they still in business?)  This specific location isn't particularly friendly or responsive, but I'm not expecting much from a $5 pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is pure garbage. But what do you expect for $5??? Was not \"Hot and Ready\" when I walked in."}
{"text":"Little Caesars, Marcos, Numero Uno etc... the fast food of pizza joints. Beware places that have pizzas 'pre-heated, ready to go.'  Quite simply, you get what you pay for. I don't even put Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominoes in the same category as these places, at least their pizzas are cooked to order.  Little Caesars crust is comparable to cardboard, the ingredients are unrelentingly cheap, and it's incredibly greasy. However the price is unbeatable. For $5 you can get a large pizza, but it's easy to see why."}
{"text":"No matter what day or time it is they never have pizza ready. Ordered deep dish half pep/sausage and half ham/ pineapple. Waited for my pizza for 40 mins. Got home and as I was taking a bite the pizza was raw!  Tried calling little Caesars and no answer. I ended up putting pizza in the oven to finish cooking. .. Called lthis place 18 times and they never answered. My husband and I were so disappointed he drove back there. Got a refund and a new pizza.. Mind u.. He's been sitting in this place for 20 minutes waiting for a pizza that takes 10 minutes to cook! Grr!"}
{"text":"I didn't know Little Cesar's had such nice stores...apparently I haven't been in a new one in a long time!! Snagged a deep dish when I saw their grand opening sign. Delicious!! Glad to have a new store in the area for quick dinner."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! My pizza order was ready and as I was retrieving it the ghetto manager 'Blanca' said just give it to someone else because they are complaining despite them calling my name. Slow service, Ghetto workers, first and last time trying little Caesars Pizza"}
{"text":"The pizza was warm well I would say almost cold, It looked like it had been sitting in someone's counter. Just Gross"}
{"text":"With out a doubt the best customer service experience we've had from any Little Caesars that we have ever been to. The young lady that helped us went above and beyond to make us happy!"}
{"text":"It's really simple, Caesars, just serve up the Hot and Ready pizzas that your plaster advertising all over for and the world will be happy. I walked in there during an off hour expecting to walk out with 3 pizzas for my kids b-day. Instead I walked in to a line of pissed of people and an empty pizza case. The girl at the counter was apologizing profusely, sounded like she was used to it. Guess the middle aged guy in the company uniform standing outside smoking was on his fmla break or something.  Anyway, it ain't HOT AND READY! Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"You CAN'T sell crap pizza. It looks old and its burnt! I know it's only $5 but seriously get your act together."}
{"text":"I love Little Ceasars Pizza for $5 but this location is disgusting!! Obviously they're using imitation cheese because the taste is gross and there's way way way way way too much sauce on the pizza there is no flavor at all whatsoever it's worse than Domino's. I'll never go here again. I suggest anyone else who wants Little Caesars drive a little further to a better location because this is truly truly disgusting. If I could write it no stars I would."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state. Hot and ready really is just a catch phrase for this location. Been twice and both times had to wait for pizza to come out. The first night a customer came after me and orders two pizzas.  The clerk took his money sent to the back cut his pizzas and delivered. Then I waited another five minutes.   At least it's only five bucks and my pizza was fresh."}
{"text":"Way too slow to get the Pizza compared to Las Vegas. But I must admit it was delicious! The crust was nice and fluffy and the sauce was just right. It turned out to be worth the wait after all."}
{"text":"Literally the worst place ever. Only ordered 2 crazy breads and the girl who was in charge of bagging the crazy bread was taking her time. There where 3 people who came in AFTER me who got their orders of bread  now I am a patient person but 10 minute for bread that was already out of the oven and just waiting on the girl to bag up TWO orders at the same time?!?   It is so chaotic here. Workers yelling at each other and instead of helping they yell back that they won't do what the other asked. I'm all for having fun at work but don't do it in front of costumers. Looks so unprofessional"}
{"text":"There was so little cheese on this pizza we could see the sauce and dough.  Worst little Caesars experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Mis-heard my order when I has asked for the bread sticks but added it and gave me a fresh batch. Small entrance esp when crowded with people trying to pick up dinner. Crowded shared parking lot."}
{"text":"Horrible, just spent 20 mins waiying for 1 hot & ready and 1 Bestest. when i seen them load the warmers 10 minutes before they called my name. so my pizzas were DONE for 10 minutes before they gave them to me. HORRIBLE... I actually seen them hand me the same ones i seen get loaded. offered me a 2 liter of soda for my wait. I didnt take it. but they need to figure out where the slack is"}
{"text":"I very much wavered between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. I opted for 3 mainly due to the sheer entertainment value that it provides and lately the service has been much better than it used to be.   A nice takeout fast food pizza joint that I am old enough to remember back in the 1980's serving square pizza. Those days are long gone and what now puts them on the map is $5 large pepperoni pizzas available \"Hot 'n Ready\" for immediate pickup and a great last minute family dinner value. For $3 more you can opt for the \"Three Meat Treat\" or Deep Dish, but I recommend calling ahead for those as they are often not available for immediate pickup.   This restaurant was largely remodeled a while back and now has dark wood fixtures and displays. The staff is young and not particularly customer friendly but adequate and efficient. It is often entertaining when you call or walk in as you can often hear and see the kids yelling at each other over various things. Oh to be young again...  I've been a customer of this Caesars for years and must say that service has improved greatly. There was a time when it would be busy and even after calling ahead, you could expect a half hour to 45 minute wait time. That seems to be alleviated now as I always call ahead and my order is usually available for pickup upon arrival.   Overall, I recommend this place for a quick value pizza and a particularly efficient last minute dinner choice for the family. Just remember to call ahead to be safe."}
{"text":"Look at all the 1 star reviews...1 star is too high. Worst location in Vegas. No lie. The last 3 times I've tried to buy a Hot N Ready, I've left empty handed. Long lines, disengaged workers that DGAF. Corporate should be embarrassed.  Any review that is not 1 star was paid for by Little Cesars' management. Or, person reviewing was being threatened with physical harm."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Little Cesars location. I really only go for the exemplary customer service by \"Eusebio\" this  young man always greets you with a smile and you leave with HIS infectious smile. KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK AND I WILL KEEP GOING TO THIS LOCATION. OUT OF MY WAY BUT WORTH IT"}
{"text":"Only giving 1 star to be able to review.  First of all, this location refuses to take phone orders. I tried calling the store 9 seperate times on my way home from work with absolutely no pick up on their end. I then went to the physical location to just go pick up one cheese pizza, the most basic order known to man & I was asked \"if I would like to wait 20 minutes\". My response to that is absolutely not. This pizza chain is supposed to be known for its convenience and somehow this store has you waiting around as long as Metro or some place making it from scratch would. This location is the worst run in the entire Henderson area. The employees are all young careless kids and it's just an awful experience every time I've been to this location. And on top of everything else, no matter what day it is...around dinnertime they don't prep anything it seems like. There's always crowds of people waiting for just a pepperoni or just a cheese. It's just nonsense. I won't even waste 5$ there anymore.   So we thank you, mcdonalds. For atleast being there when people are hungry."}
{"text":"Good staff and friendly people. The food is great for the price. It's not the best pizza in the world, but that's not the employees fault.. it's the recipes they're given. Overall 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"One star because it is the minimum to leave a review. I am a fan of Little Cesar's. I even worked at a franchise back in college. With that said, my pizza tonight looked beautiful but once opening the box, it smelled like a beer can! My wife took he first bite and spit it out. I went to bite and was overwhelmed with what could have been spoiled cheese. Gross. I'm disgusted. We called and was offered a refund which is appreciated but doesn't fix this error. I don't think I could come back here and I definitely doubt I will be eating pizza again any time soon."}
{"text":"I live less than half a mile away and the pizza was ready but not hot, do not go to this location. You're better off buying a lunchables and putting it in the microwave. If I could give this negative stars I would. Cheese hardly covers the pizza and sauce was cold."}
{"text":"No pizzas ready and little elder lady in the back touched her hair and her face and started touching pizzas again ! Not cool at all !!!"}
{"text":"I love little Caesars pizza ... the food is always the same at every location.. it's great! I only gave one star because this location has a 15 minute or more wait for a basic pepperoni pizza EVERY TIME I COME! It's 7pm.. I would understand if there was a rush but even then you guys should have a better more efficient system down to accommodate for busy times... again it's not even busy right now. What is the point of advertising the hot-n-ready slogan that this franchise is known for if you can't deliver on the goods?? I've been coming here for 3 years as it's the closest to my house you would think you guys would have this down by now... come one guys!"}
{"text":"So not hot and so not ready! Too busy talking to each other to make sure there is pizza like advertised? Rude and inconvenient. The pizza isn't good enough for the wait."}
{"text":"I decided to give this location one more try. The wait time is horrible at this location. I mean you clearly see that the holding ovens have pizza in them yet people are forced to wait. So this evening I went back ( I have 5 hungry kids waiting at home for dinner) , placed an order at 607 pm and waited til 631 pm to cut back into the line to ask why am I still waiting? I clearly saw my food being made and put into the holding oven. I then saw my food go into other peoples arms that ordered after me.  I am in the hospitality business, you do not make guests wait almost 30 minutes for service. The manager is not very helpful either at this location. I had to call them after I got home. I did not check my food before we left and I lost out on my marinara sauce ( which I paid extra for). He said I would have to drive back tonight for resolution (yeah right , too tired)"}
{"text":"I've been to this little Caesars more than once in the past and the only reason I'm giving them one star is because the young man actually added more butter and Parmesan to the bread that I called ahead for and that you charge me for to add extra butter I stopped going to this location several months ago for the same reason and I go back today giving them another chance and they are still one of the worst in my book"}
{"text":"If I could give this location a zero I would. They never answer the phones for phone orders. it's never hot and ready. I guess that's what you get for 5.00!!. Tonight we went at 8:20. We waited behind TWO people for over 20 minutes wanting to get a pizza. The lady working the register was so slow. she was more concerned throwing the boxes of old pizzas out onto the floor and looking confused at ticket orders than helping the line of customers going out the door. We watched pizzas from the oven being thrown on stacks of boxes just sitting their until she had time to cut them. We finally got her to take our order after 20 minutes waiting. It came from the holding bin!! Knowing it sat there the 20 minutes we waited and not knowing how long it was in there before we got there! Burnt and dry as toast! Thanks lady!! Maybe you should get those pizzas out faster so they are fresh Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"I went to go get pizza for my daughters birthday party yesterday. There was 2 people in line in front of me. All was greeted nicely and told to have a nice day BUT for some reason jazmine the girl who worked the register wanted to catch an attitude and roll her eyes at me when I asked for in a nice voice for 2 pepperoni and 2 cheese. Then she slammed the pizzas on the counter. Aggressively gave me the receipt to sign and not even say have a good day. I was in such belief that I was not once rude to this girl but who like to automatically have an attitude with me Oh and not only that but charge me for 5 pizzas when I was sure of being clear with 2 and 2. Didn't know that equal to 5.   Jazmine needs to work on her customer service skills and her basic math. Other wise if she does not like working there then find another job. Plain & simple."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service that was provided. I always go to this little caesars. The very last time I went, I asked for a fresh cheese pizza and the young kid in the register refused to give me a fresh pizza. He gave me one that was in the in the hot oven behind the register. The cheese looked old and the pizza didn't look appetizing. He gave me a blank stare and said that's fresh. It fuel my anger so much since I'm a paying customer and this never has happened to me. Needing to feed my kids, I took the pizza. It was the worst pizza I ever eaten from little caesars. I will never go back their as long as they have these punks working the front who don't care about customer service!!!! Their is a little caesars down the street from this location who provide fast customer service and listens to what the customer wants!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. Come one people! Either you like it or you don't! In my case, I like it because of the fact that it's only 5 bucks for a large cheese or pepperoni pizza! My kids love this stuff and it's easy on my wallet. The pizza itself is not the best but good enough for me and my family!   The first paragraph pretty much sums up the 4 stars. I would of gave them 5 stars not too long ago. Why? Because before the crazy bread was only 99 cents and it automatically came with marinara sauce to dip it in. Now it costs 2.50 and the marinara sauce is extra now. Their wings are pretty good too which used to be 5 bucks for an order of 6. Now it's 6 bucks. Really? A dollar a wing? The wings and breadsticks alone would satisfy me. Now that luxury is gone and we just have the 5 dollar pizzas to go by.   As for service, sometimes it hit or miss. Often times its a miss when they have the lunch and dinner rush. You cant blame them for being really busy those times because like I said, its hard to beat a large 5 dollar pizza that is ready to go as soon as you pay. The misses are usually if you call for take out and order some of the other pizzas that are not pre made. Since they are constantly pumping out 5 dollar large cheese and pepperoni pizzas, regular orders get mixed up, which happened to me a couple times. They would forget a topping or put a topping I didn't want.  So hate these guys all you want. Bottom line is, their 5 dollar pizzas are hard to beat especially when you have kids and want to save money. It's a win win for both parties. I would say enjoy this deal while it is still good because my assumption is that it will go up to 6 bucks as well eventually.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #67"}
{"text":"Great price, Great pizza... they had to make my cheese/pepperoni large which only took minutes! I was in the area and since we don't have one near us out at the airport I decided to take one home.  It was still hot when I got there! I did order their wings... ; ( like they say stick to what you're good at. Love their pizza.. the fellows working there were all friendly ... For $6 this is the best... the same size with less pepperoni around the airport area is much higher.. So even if you have to wait... be patient its' worth it..."}
{"text":"Hot and ready is NEVER ready. Even if you order ahead, you still wait 30 mins and they don't care!"}
{"text":"I paid for a soda and I called the store, the lady was polite and took my name down she said they could replace my soda. I come back the next week the cashier and talk to the manager and says that I didn't get my soda last week. The manager immediately started y'all lien that they do not give out free soda. I was not asking for free soda, I was asking if I could get my soda that I paid for last week and forgot to grab. The manager didn't even look at me or want to talk to me and the cashier just began to be pushy because a line formed behind me as soon as I was up to take my order. The only reason I went to this location with to get my phone and I forgot, I will never visit this location again not that it really matters. But you better believe I'm going to call the store and I'm going to call the corporation to see why this one manager could everreplace my soda. I know it was my mistake but help a customer out for one it's called customer service for reason."}
{"text":"I had time to write this review. For just a pepperoni pizza. Come on. Get it together. Sunday at 2 place packed. No rush. What a shame."}
{"text":"The worst place to come! Called in 20min and they told us it would be done. By the time we got here we had to wait for another 20 min. Better off finding another place to go to."}
{"text":"Hot and ready, but not necessarily accessible. During my visit they where packed! It's a good thing I'm a patient man,This location apeared to have  two people working. This is unfair to the staff and slows down service, given that the other types of pizzas although seemingly prefab, have to be put in the oven and attended to when ordered, not to mention the various other menu items.Putting an obvious strain on the counter staff, when dealing with a packed house. In my visit today I ordered an Italian cheesy bread, and my  wife got us the Hawaiian pizza which as I alluded to above is not hot nor ready.After receiving into our order we came home and started on the cheesy bread, which tastes amazing until you get to the middle and start tasting a bland cardboard like product(texture).The Hawaiian pizza was a surprise, with nice chunky strips of ham."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order my pepperoni hot and ready since they never seem to have them ready, the guy on the phone asked how long I was going to be and I told him less than 5 minutes away. So he proceeded to tell me that \"It's fine just come in and it'll be ready for you\". He never asked my name or put my order in. So I get there and he acts like he never talked to me and said they had none ready. I have no problem waiting, but I called them ahead for a reason and now I'm going to be late for where I need to be because they are so behind and gave my pizza away."}
{"text":"Usually this place is great. Employees are friendly, quick, even when it's packed. Today unfortunately was kind of a flop day. My family and I were eating when I seemed to hit a pocket of so much oregano, it was like chewing on a spoonful of leaves. IT WAS SPICY. Figured it was a fluke till my two-year-old got a mouthful too, screaming, grabbing her tongue and now refusing to eat because it hurt. I'm assuming it was just a fluke but maybe it got a little too hectic and things went a little too fast."}
{"text":"At this point, I can only assume the owners of this store have no interest in retaining customers due to the extreme lack of decent customer service from both the employees and their managers. Three things are certain in this store: a cashier with an attitude problem, a lack of appropriate amount of staff on duty, and a 20-30 minute wait for a simple \"hot and ready\" pizza.  It's the same story every time."}
{"text":"Third time in a row I have been here and there are NO pizzas available.  Bad for customer service....I'll continue to go down Las Vegas Blvd where I've always been in and out. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"You know you won't get Chicago style pizza or $25 quality here; let's be honest, this is where you get cheap, indiscriminate pizza and quick.  Not that that is a bad thing.  The staff here work rather hard to sling out these cheap but filling pizzas on the regular. There can be times, in their speed, that the occasional pizza may have little sauce.. but otherwise, still a go-to place for a neighbourhood pizza!"}
{"text":"The price there isn't bad with $5 for a large pizza. Although, the wait time at this location does not make it worth the short drive from there to my house. Everytime I have ever gone in, it was crowded with the cramped space and a mob of people waiting for pizzas which were supposed to be \"Hot-And-Ready.\"       Because of the small space it is extremely hot in there, even during cold days. During the hot summer months, especially in Vegas, you would think that they would have some sort of system to cool the place down. Overall, no matter how convenient the location may be, it's worth going to another Little Caesar's where the pizza is really \"Hot-And-Ready\" with a proper AC system."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Little Caesar's but at this location they are winning me over. Besides the pizza being ready on time and friendly staff, it taste good. I recommend don't go to late at night the area isn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Don't call in an order.. I called in an order. \"Ready in 10/15 minutes.\" When I get there, and I give them my name, one employee starts to pull my order, then says she forgot something. Puts the pizza back in the warmer rack and runs to the back. So I sit for a minute. Another employee comes and pulls the pizza and gives it to a customer that just walked in and ordered.  First employee comes out from the back and can't find the pizza I ordered and has to make another one.  I was waiting 30 minutes in the store and got there 15 minutes after I placed my order.  Just don't call in your order!!! Walk in and they'll give you what's ready. If it's someone's else's order or not.   Next time, I'll phone order 5 of the same pizzas with a fake name and walk in to buy just one."}
{"text":"We went there for their \"Hot and Ready\" pizza. We wound up waiting about half an hour, which is hardly \"ready\". The pizza tasted like cardboard. The guy behind the counter was not very friendly.  We haven't gone back."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Was told 10-12 minutes, waited 30 minutes to be told that my pizza had never been put in the oven. Last year at this time they messed up my order (see my 6/28/2015 review) and today was even worse. I will not be trying this chain again, there are too many good pizzas in town to deal with this."}
{"text":"Oh please, called placed order not my fault if my parents named me Beyoncé, so go and pick it up, and it isn't made because they thought it was a crake call. They should have asked me that on the phone. So now guess what waiting for the pizza to be made...was this an inconvenience that they should have done something about?"}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times in the past year: service is minimal but has always been speedy in my experiences. Little things like no napkins, plates, or cutlery to accompany orders can become very annoying; especially when ordering multiple pizzas like I do for work functions. Food has been hot and ready every time I've called in ahead of time, and maximum wait time when I've walked in without prior ordering has never been more than just a few minutes."}
{"text":"Wasn't really a Little Caesar's Pizza fan but had it from here a few times and it's really good. Great deals, non soggy crazy bread. They always have their pizza stocked up so you never have a wait."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for... $5 made pizzas are perfect for on the go snacks for the famo or I pick them up when I feel like being nice for my basketball team. I wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Okay, it's Little Caesars, you're not expecting great pizza, but it's decent, especially if you've been out drinking.     I used to go every once in a while before I started watching what I was eating better.  I usually tried to bring exact change because if I paid with a $20 they'd give me back change for a $10.  That's what you expect when people are getting minimum wage and don't really care about their job."}
{"text":"More times than not, when I go into to this place, the \"Hot & Ready\" pizza is never ready, this time they tell me it is going to be a 10 minute wait! I say, it is not Hot and ready, and the two young men makes a sly comment as I am leaving, not cool. I can not recommend a place that does not have their items as advertised, than insults them when they leave."}
{"text":"Okay, the Hot and Ready deal is a joke.  They never have the $5 pizzas ready, and there is always a wait.  To top it off, the last three times I have been there, the clueless counter person has given away our pizza and bread to someone else, making our supposed 10 minute wait closer to 20-25 minutes.  While you can't beat the cheap price, the service is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"I just want to ask why... Why are there never any pizzas? Why if you order online they say that the order was never even placed when they charged you for it? Why does a HOT AND READY pizza take 30 minutes? Why are there so many bad reviews and the owner/ manager doesn't do anything to fix it. Someone needs to step in and fix this. I feel bad for all the employees because they always are stressed from everyone yelling at them. All you need to do is prepare for rushes by having a bunch of pizzas ready like you advertise that you do."}
{"text":"This is the worst location we have ever been to. I'd give it ZERO STARS but it's not an option. There was nothing ready when we got there, we placed an order and was told it would be a 10 minute wait. Sat there for well over 10 minutes as we watched multiple people just walk in, place orders and walk out with food. After sitting for close to 30 minutes and asking the kid at the counter he says \"oh I thought I already gave you your food\". WTF? Do you not notice people just sitting around waiting and are you not looking at the tags you print out? After waiting for over 40 minutes and being told it's coming it's coming and continually watching people just walk in off the street and walk right out with food we finally had enough and asked for our money back. This location is ridiculous. Pizza Genius? More like Pizza Morons. Try a little harder next time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service... Literally set my order on the counter because her manager called her over to argue and bitch at her. I don't even blame the employee as much as the manager because she could clearly see her employee helping me. Added a good five minutes to my visit there unnecessarily."}
{"text":"$5 dollar service for $5 dollar pizza. Its never ready and always have to wait 15 plus minimum on a good day. No good."}
{"text":"Hot, Fresh and Ready! I love this location because they have a drive thru. I have to say whether picking up or driving thru this location is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I never had Little Ceasars and wanted to try the bacon wrapped pizza, but decided on the hot and ready medium pepperoni walk -in special to start.  I was weary about the quality, number of toppings and the freshness of the pizza.  For $5.55 plus HST, this pizza is amazing!!! Crispy crust, lots of pepperoni topping, tasty, fresh, and just hot enough to enjoy right away!!!  The great part is that it really is hot and ready with no waiting involved!!!"}
{"text":"The  employees here are a bunch of rude young teenagers that would smart alecs and think horse playing in the back is more fun then doing there job.  They don't care about there customers  at all.  When they mess up on a special order and you call them they tell you well I cannot do anything unless you bring the whole pizza back. Well I'm not driving all the way back there can I get a credit no if you can bring me the pizza now I'm sorry I can't help you is there anything else you need?? Yes your name hang up"}
{"text":"Now let me start off by saying that I understand this is a fast food pizza joint and I shouldn't expect perfection but the quality of pizza at this location continues to go downhill with every visit.  Little Caesars has always been able to fulfill my sudden craving for pizza on the go. I use to look forward to their simple pepperoni hot n ready deep dish or their buffalo wings. Their pizza for as fast as they make it always has the perfect cheese and sauce ratio, their wings although not huge WingStop type wings but still had the perfect amount of sauce and were just so tender. However I must say after tonights visit I'm extremely dissapointed. The wings were no bigger than a quarter and cooked/microwaved to the point of being tough and our pizza was burned and overcooked sooo much the pizza soaked up all the sauce and you could barely tell cheese was even on it and oh were those pepperoni's or meat chips? I was so dissapointed I chose to eat ramen after a few awful bites that were quite a struggle to get down. Don't know if I will ever come back to this location."}
{"text":"The location is easy entry and exit, the undermanned staff was always doing the best they could both times I've been there with lines out the door.  Seriously folks, don't visit here having $50 expectations with their service and product while having a $5 price tag.       Tip: don't park next to the handicap spots in front of Starbucks. The a-typical d-bags who do not know how to park properly while not being handicapped at all usually smash in those spots to get their grandelattefrappecrappe."}
{"text":"Meh, Little Caesars works for a cheap, quick meal. The last couple times I went to this location it tasted slightly like eating cardboard with tomato sauce on it, and I had to do a tyrannosaurus-eating motion with my neck to get the pizza to tear while eating it... but as the last person said: it's $5, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"LOVED IT ! So the lady was nice and the pizza was yumy :) so glad we decided to go here!! Will come back ! Seriously a good place to go"}
{"text":"I've tried this location a few times, at various times of the day hoping for something different with each visit. But no, every time I've gotten a pizza from this location they're old, dry, and way over cooked. I'm not sure if their ovens are up too high, but they're so over cooked that you can't even enjoy the crust of the pizzas. Highly disappointed because the location is convenient. But nobody likes over cooked pizza."}
{"text":"I really like me sum little caesar's but this location needs a little undercover boss. Ran by kids so there's not much to the order of things. It's basically putting out fires 24/7 here. Thank goodness the little caesar pizza making idea is almost bulletproof because thats the only thing that will keep this place together. Every time I've come here my order gets messed up. No one ever seams happy when they get up to the counter. Orders are messed up or lost in the mix. All the monkeys in the back are running a million miles an hour trying to quickly put out the fires and occasionally you'll see the monkeys fling a little poo."}
{"text":"Pizzas are never hot and ready pizza here and there is always some one without netted hair. Why does it say hot and readyzone and there isnt one pizza hot and ready. Not one. Its super lame. I get its cheap pizza but don't say it will be hot and ready and make me wait 20 min. I came here for hot and ready, not to wait."}
{"text":"I placed my order went to the store to get beer (because Friday) I gave the facility 10-15 as they requested come back to pick up my order and the cashier tells me that order has been picked up already.... I told him it wasn't picked up by me?! Because my car doesn't have pizza in it?!! They legit said \" we have never had this happen\"  How does someone else grab another persons order literally you have to have the receipt to get the food? The incompetence."}
{"text":"This isn't based on just 1 visit...but my visit tonight was probably the worst I have had. I called and pre-ordered due to knowing this takes FOREVER for a \"hot and ready\" pizza. They told me it would be about 5 minutes for my order, I drove to the location and they didn't have my order, no apologizes, no we'll hurry to get it ready, just rang me up and let me wait...30 minutes later, after giving people who came in after I did their orders, they finally asked me what my order was. This place is horrible, need some drastic changes and they need new management!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed today when I went in for my free pizza and was denied the pizza. Upon waking up this morning I watched fox 10 and channel 3 news..both of which said little Caesars was doing free pizza from 11 to 2 because of a bet they l9st dealing with basketball. I got there at 105 and was told the promo ended at 1.  So little Caesars put out false advertising to the news stations , not good for business.  Instead of honoring what the news said I was given a coupon for next time for a free pizza but in order to get the free pizza I have to buy one,  how is that fair...it's not and I am extremely disappointed with this company and store, not to mention the manager seemed like she was dazed and cinfused"}
{"text":"Its true pizzas arent ready, 5 people waiting, 6:44pm on a Wednesday busy night maybe?"}
{"text":"Horrible place never have pizza and they tell you only 10 min wait but you end up waiting 30+min for a hot and ready. I switched over to dominos"}
{"text":"The last 3 times we have had issues, pretty sure this will be our last. The first 2 visits, no \"hot n ready\" pizzas. This visit, I ended up with a burnt pizza. $9 for a burnt pizza, waste of money."}
{"text":"I wish all chain restaurants where created equal!  This place is hit and miss!  Some days the pizza is good for 5 bucks and other days, it's down right horrible. Today we waited for breadsticks, during the wait several hot and ready pizzas went out the door.  When the breadsticks were done, we got our one pepperoni and one cheese and we were gone. Got home ten minutes later and the pepperoni was crap. Burned on top and not hot.  The cheese pie was good. My advice is always check your pizza before leaving.  If it looks good, its most likely edible!"}
{"text":"No stars called for the last 10 mins no answer, I don't want to wait for my pizza.. I'd rather order it through the phone & pick up"}
{"text":"Best part about this place is one of the managers Joe, he is AWESOME We dont order their ready pizzas we custom order ours & whenever he is on the crew he has with him is flawless, our pizza is perfect & store looks and is ran right! Cant say so much for when he isnt there...we usually walk in & if we dont see him we walk out & have pizza another night but GO JOE!"}
{"text":"Amazing Smokehouse BBQ Pizza!  Just had the Smokehouse BBQ pizza.  We always have high hopes for BBQ pizza, but they always disappoint.  This was amazing!  Totally cravable."}
{"text":"The first time I had the \"Hot and Ready\" I was disapoonted. It was dry and warm. Next time I called ahead of time and ordered a pizza. Much better for the same price!"}
{"text":"Ready to go pizza? We were told it would be no more than 5min... But it was actually 35min. What a joke. Worst customer service and attitude. Do not bother coming here you'll be waiting for a very long time...the worst part was I got food poisoning and was up all night. Thanks little Cesar's"}
{"text":"Cheap, consistent, and good for a little Caesars. They spare no grease or cheese at this location. Good for when you have \"the itch\"."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for very affordable and fast pizza. Their $5.00 pizzas are always ready to go, so you don't have to wait long unless there's a line. The cashier was friendly and helpful, and there's ample parking outside. We had to feed a small crowd, so Little Caesars' pricing is easy on the wallet. I have been here several times already and have never been disappointed with the taste. My only wish is that they would expand their choices for their $5.00 menu."}
{"text":"This Little Caesars Pizza location can be found on the southwest corner of Warm Springs and Durango Road, inside a mini strip mall portion in the Vons area. LC is perfect for cheap, quick, and easy pizza on the go and last minute. It's not the best pizza around, but will do in a pinch.  I hate to say it, but these reviews are spot on when it comes to the service here. These employees could not be more disengaged and disinterested if they tried. Seriously, some of them look like they would rather kill themselves than keep working. I'm not expecting 5 star, 5 diamond out of LC, but this is pretty bad.   Even for what it is, this is not a good location even by LC standards. For cheap quick pizza, I've been going to Pizza Hut more and more lately. They have some good specials going and the employees at least say Hi to you.  2 stars.  Definitely experienced better lol"}
{"text":"As far as LC goes, this location is solid!   Located on the southeast corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, it is kind of tucked away a bit behind the gas station.  I live about 5-10 minutes away, so for a quick cheap fix you can't beat that hot n ready deal! If you're looking for gourmet, top shelf pizza, than you are an idiot if you are looking for it here.  But...  -It is good for a quick, cheap fix if you don't feel like cooking or going for, you know, real food..  -If you have friends/family that are over that have kids, than this is a GREAT solution to take care of the kiddies on the cheap..  - sometimes it is nice to just grab a redbox movie(or2), curl up on the couch, and grab a couple of these pizzas and enjoy and a nice, quiet night in without breaking the bank! (Hey! Who says you have to spend hundreds a night??)  Plus they stay open until 10pm and everytime I've gone in there the service has been quick and friendly..so I am going to give it...   4 stars."}
{"text":"I've never waited less than 10 minutes for a pizza here, even during hot n ready hours. Absolutely not worth a trip"}
{"text":"Quick, easy, dad enjoys the hot & ready. Better than any other $5 pizza. Staff is friendly and I always come back when craving cheap but fresh pizza! Wish they could deliver."}
{"text":"I've always loved Little Caesar's $5 Hot-N-Ready pizzas. They're so convenient for parties and potlucks. I came here last night to get a couple pizzas for my nephew's birthday. When we parked outside I noticed there were a lot of customers waiting, but when we went in we were helped out immediately and we got their last two pepperoni pizzas ($10.81). Don was very hungry though, so he wanted to add on some bread sticks. He asked how much bread sticks were and instead of responding to that exact question, the cashier said, \"For just a dollar more you can get some cheese bread. It just came out of the oven, so it's nice and fresh.\" Because of the way he worded it and answered the question, I thought he meant a dollar more than our current total. However, he handed us the cheese bread and rung us up for a little over $15. I'll admit, I should've known cheese bread wouldn't be a buck, but I couldn't help feeling a little tricked. The pizzas and cheese bread were fresh and tasty though, so I think this place is A-OK."}
{"text":"Four stars because it's generally what you would expect from a Little Caesars. When I want a convenient, acceptable $5 pizza, I come here. I recently tried the new deep dish stuffed crust pizza, which was very tasty. The one complaint I have is that of the many times I've been here, the \"Hot-n-Ready\" pizzas have not once been ready upon our arrival, even when calling ahead. Other Little Caesars locations I've been to have always had enough Hot-n-Readies that I've been able to get my pizza and get out the door within 5 minutes, but here it's always at least a 5 minute wait. While it's not as prompt as I'd like, it's still much quicker than going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Go to another location! Terrible! I waited 35 min for a hot n ready pizza and breadsticks. When I finally got my food, the breadsticks weren't cooked. They were pale and soggy! And they didn't give me marinara. So I had to go back, and then they gave me some ice cold sauce. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Almost 30 mins now and got my order as they scan it they forgot to put in bread sticks. Another 10 mins. This place sucks bad"}
{"text":"I approached the cashier with a hello how are you and she just stared at me with a \"what do u want\" face. Worst customer service ever! I will never come back. I would give \"0\" stars if i could. Beware. Stay away from this unfriendly place!"}
{"text":"Hot and ready? They obviously do not understand the concept. Ordered pepp pizza double cut and wings. There was a sign that said if they do not ask if you would like to add to your order the crazy bread combo it's free so the lady didn't ask and I mentioned it to the lady she rolled her eyes and gave me her attitude.  The  lady said 8 mins for the wings which I was ok with, 15 mins later I asked about the wings and was told it was 10 more minutes.  No sense of time. If you're looking for something fast do NOT go to this location!!!"}
{"text":"Granted it is Friday night, so they are going to be busy, but that was ridiculous.... arrived to wait 10 minutes just to order, order and be told there will be an approximately 15 minute wait.... finally after 35minutes the order is ready. Check the pizzas just to see that in their flurry to get some orders out, they dumped a pile of sausage in one area.... complete disorganization"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in a rush and need to feed the house I come here and every time is such a huge mistake. There is no \"Hot and Ready\" at this location I am always stuck waiting 10-20 minutes, even when it's dead! The cashier does not smile and so dead energy wise that you can barely hear what she's saying while she's mumbling so fast, then rudely yells when she needs to repeat herself. It was was annoying when she did it to me but it was completely unpleasant to watch her do it to the old couple that came in after me. Told my boyfriend I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could upload video of this place while waiting 8 mins for any pizza to come up I video taped the workers in the back goofing off and playing catch. The guy at the register running to the back to make pizzas didn't even wash his hands!!"}
{"text":"I would like an explanation of what HOT & READY really means. Every single time I go there, nothing is ever HOT & READY...and all I want is a cheese pizza, probably the least complicated of pizzas to make. One time I was told 10 min and it ended up being more like 20. This is an extremely busy location... knowing that you really need to have these pizzas and extras coming out quicker."}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming back here? Always a long wait and never enough help. I love your pizza but service is consistently horrible."}
{"text":"Omg this place is incredibly slow and the workers have no common sense.  We go to this location bcs it's the closest to our home and my boyfriend loves their breadsticks, nothing else.  So when he gets his cravings... we gotta go.   Tonight we waited over 30 mins for an order of breadsticks and we weren't the only ones.  For some reason the cashier took all the orders but then never fired the orders.  People were complaining and some even wanted refunds and left.  We were so hungry by this point and waited so long already that we stayed for our breadsticks.  In the end, they didn't even put enough garlic on them and they were dry."}
{"text":"This is a really nice Little Carsar's!!! Fast and friendly service despite how busy they were ; ) And really good food!! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I had an issue ordering over the phone and the lady having a very poor attitude.   My Inlaw went to pick up the food and waited forever, the order was my near ready.. And the lady had forgotten most my order. She also had a very rude attitude while dealing with customers.  I wrote the store and still have not got a resolution. Needless to say I have not returned."}
{"text":"It was ACTUALLY HOT AND READY!!!!!! \"3 star pizza, 5 star service, that's all that matters\" as my boyfriend said. Anyways, my family actually likes Little Caesar's pizza, it's not bad. I'm not a big fan of the sauce, but the crust is good and I love their crazy bread. This location is really small but I didn't have to wait for two pepperoni pizzas and that's pretty much unheard of at Little Caesers. So, it was a pretty good experience. Now I gotta go eat my pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I came in the other day as I usually get pizza from here once and a while if my family asks me to pick some up. It's right by my gym. I came around dinner time, which I know is usually the most difficult time to actually get food at Little Caesar's. The wait time for two pepperoni pizzas was FORTY MINUTES. Like, are you kidding??? The place was packed and there was no food readily available!! You know dinner is your most busy time, why not be prepared? I just couldn't get over the wait time and the waiting area of the restaurant is too hot to wait in. A couple other people and I left. I can't say I'll never be back here again, because it is in a convenient location. But I really don't like this place much anymore."}
{"text":"Came in, waited less than 5 minutes, walked out with 2 pizzas and ~crazy bread~!  As the last reviewer said: no complaints here, in and out! :)"}
{"text":"Kimberly A. is noted as the cashier on my receipt. Just an over all awful service. I watched her give someone a bag and did not offer to help the lady with her four orders. When I ordered, she did not say anything after the transaction was done, so I initiated by saying thank you very much and she did not respond. When we got our pizza she just said my name and left the counter. Looked like she didn't want to be there and all of the customers waiting for their food were able to tell which made it even more uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This little Caesars location is by far the worst I have ever been to! If I could give zero stars I would. I always order by phone before hand and when I get there end up having to wait at least an hour and the pizza ends up being cold. The manager at this location does not have a great system going to produce great pizzas in a timely manner. I would NOT recommend this location."}
{"text":"Nice experience coming here from California thanks to the kids running the place they are quick and have great customer service"}
{"text":"The one thing about Little Caesars is that the product is always the same, consistency is indeed a hallmark of their product. And the pizza, for what it is, is very good. I can not only vouch for that myself but my two dogs can also. While I eat the majority of the pizza, they absolutely love the crust. Between them they will wolf down every crust I offer to them. Matter of fact they love every pizza crust no matter who has made it. So I guess Little Caesars would be a 5 tail wags from my dogs....as well as my 4 stars. So human and canine review are both very good....woof, woof."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would stupid crazy wait time and very rude and disrespectful I orders 20 min Advance and I still waited 30 min more when I got there this place needs to get shut down !"}
{"text":"Cheese pizza is never hot and ready what's the point of advertising that. Come on my lunch and leave with no food. Finally tried it for the last time and I'm not waiting on my 30 minute lunch. Completely unreliable don't go here"}
{"text":"i called in my order today (which i haven't done before) and i spoke to Jordan.  HE was THE most helpful, patient and knowledgeable person to ever answer a pizza phone.  i ordered a veggie pizza without cheese and straight away he said \"oh, a vegan pizza!\" and i couldn't believe my ears.  Never has anyone knew what to call it.  I ordered a few more pizzas and he repeated the order back to me and i was pleasantly surprised with the service.  i ordered the pizza for work and for sure we will order from here again.  delicious.  amazing.  both the pizza and the serivc"}
{"text":"This is another one of those times when I wish that you could give zero or negative stars. I am not expecting the world's greatest pizza when I go to little caesars. Let's be honest, most of us go there because it is fast and you can walk right in and get a pizza within minutes. At least that is what I thought until today. Today I walked in, asked for a hot and ready and was told they had none so the \"hot and ready\" sign meant nothing but no, the epic fail doesn't end there. She proceeded to tell me it would be 45 minutes before they had more. Forty....five....minutes . Is it me or does that seem longer than it would be if you just ordered a pizza . To top it all off, the person at the register didn't seem to care about this or think there was anything wrong with this statement. It is pretty pathetic when you go in not expecting much and get much less than that. Zero stars little caesars...you are a disappointment on every level."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. No food poisoning, consistent food quality, super fast service. For the price I have no complaints. The wings are imo soggy but again for the price not unexpected. The service is spotty but it's pretty evident that many of their hires are younger people whom are still learning the ropes of having a job. I think that's cool- young people need experience. And I get cheap tasty pizza. Works for me!"}
{"text":"Seriously this is the worst one I have been to. They are rude and it takes them 20 minutes just to take your order. This is the second time they have messed up. How hard is it to mess up on pizza. Omg"}
{"text":"This Little Caesar's is weak as hell, when they get busy they don't know what the f*** they are doing. And when they forget to ask \"if you'd like free crazy bread.\" And catch them slipping they don't even give it to you. Bruh I'm so fed up with this place, y'all have good pizza but terrible business"}
{"text":"Don't expect hot & ready at this location!!  We even tried to call ahead, nobody answers the phone.  When we mentioned it upon arrival we were told \"have a nice day\".  It's 9:30pm, nobody inside & NOT ONE PIZZA READY!!   Awful customer service!  First time here in years, it will be years before we're back"}
{"text":"Pizza is never hot and ready from 4-8 people walking around very unorganized terrible location don't wast your time."}
{"text":"We've been to this location half a dozen times ... something consistently happens when we walk through the door... consistently the \"hot and readys\" are \"cold and not ready\" wait times are consistently longer than estimated. Once our pizzas were given away to someone else and this time the card machines where not functional...  I guess you can't have it all ... decent price and good service"}
{"text":"Still \"Hot and UNREADY!\" I rarely stop here anymore, but it was an urgent situation, however I found that once again this pizza place was out of \"Hot and Ready\" pizzas. We were told it would be a 7 minute wait. Since it only takes 8 minutes from start to finish to make these pizzas that meant that they had not even put them in the oven yet. There were 4 families waiting for pizza when we arrived and 8 families waiting for pizza when we left. Yeh, it was dinnertime, but clearly this store was not ready for normal dinnertime orders. The pizza itself is a little better than freezer pizzas in a grocery store and the mix of crust, cheese, meat, and sauce is OK. The price is is still just $5 per pizza. I bumped the stars up to 3 from 2 due to keeping the price unchanged for years. Parking is easy. The staff is still mainly high school kids and the service reflects that. Bottom line: \"Hot and Ready\" is a great concept, but only if there are actually pizzas ready to go!"}
{"text":"There are never hot n ready pizzas ready 15 mom wait for two pepperoni pizzas.  This seems to be a theme at this location."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of Little Caesar's in the area. The nearest one to this location is 5 miles away at Lee and Harvard. As a result, this one does a high volume so the propensity of mistakes are high. Hot n Ready does not really apply here since most of the time the inventory is gone. Service is, well, slow and at times intimidating. On most busy Saturday evenings  there are two or three people working and 8 people in the lobby. The heat cabinet usually has no pizzas in them. That's good and bad. It means hot and ready is null, but the pizza you end up getting should be fairly hot, albeit prepared to a substandard degree. Expect your order to come out incorrectly.  Foodwise, it's decent. If you are willing to spend a bit more, orders a Cavs pie from Georgios across the street."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Little Ceasar's food, this is a great location. It has always been stocked with their hot and ready stuff, staff is friendly, and even when it is busy it never feels too busy."}
{"text":"Once again you can forget about \" fast and ready\". False advertising!!! You will most likely wait. Hire more people or get more ovens."}
{"text":"Was expecting nothing great since this place has 1.5 stars (currently) but this has been the best little Caesars I've ever been to. All of the employees were very nice and made everything in a timely manner.   Perfect place to go to before the drive in to have pizza and a movie!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Never have anything ready and when you phone an order in half hour in advance YOUR STILL WAITING 10 plus mins when you get there while people coming in get there orders ahead of you. The  Lil caesars franchise is known for speed but this place fails terribly. Time for new management!"}
{"text":"This location needs their management to conduct some SERIOUS training ASAP. I go here quite frequently and always call my order in to pick up. The past 4 times I have shown up and my order was wrong. They usually make me a new pizza right away that is correct and I go about my day. Tonight I did the same as usual and called in my order. I arrived and my order was wrong. The girl behind the counter said she'll have a new one made correctly and even repeated back to me what I ordered. I waited and got my new pizza and it was wrong as well. I'm also pretty sure that multiple employees were high so that did not help. I know it's Little Caesars and I don't expect Ruths Chris quality when I go but I'd like to have my order right just once. Please, fix this ASAP.    Update 10/10/17: apparently the management of this location has done absolutely nothing to improve. I placed an order for pickup, just a pizza and wings and when I arrived the pizza was wrong and they informed me they were out of wings (something they neglected to tell me on the phone). The management really needs to fix these very simple issues. They gave me the replacement pizza and it was wrong as well. There is no excuse for such a track record of incompetence.  Someone really needs to do some employee retraining so they listen to what customers actually order."}
{"text":"No Hot-N-Ready's EVER! They should call them Cold-N-Not-Ready! Seriously stupid! How hard it is to have pizza ready?? All the other Little Ceasars can do it what is their issue!"}
{"text":"The Hot N Ready menu wasn't so Hot and ready. Had to wait almost 20 minutes for the pizza. And there was a store full of people also waiting.   In the 20 minutes i was there The store had 5 customers walk out because of the wait time. Wonder how much business they lose because of this.   If you have somewhere to be on time with food, don't come here."}
{"text":"Remember back when we were kids you used to get 2 pizzas on a huge sheet of cardboard then it  was covered in paper? Split it with a friend for $5.00, including crazy bread!!  Fast forward 20 years and now you average about $20 for 2 pizzas, 1 crazy bread and a 2 liter. Pizza tastes the same, the recipe hasn't changed a bit. Should have invested in Little Caesars Pizza!   This location is new, it's where Fresh and Easy was built 3 plus years ago and never opened. Same little random shopping center. It gets busy, but we have never had to wait for pizza. The great thing about fast food pizza, it's always ready.   Coincidently, if you want real pizza, Barros is right up the road a few miles and for the same $20 you can get 2 large pizzas there. Or 1 large and 12 wings. :)"}
{"text":"I've held doing a review of this place for a while since it used to be a great branch, but it has gone downhill the last couple of years. Customer service is lacking, the pizzas are neither hot nor ready and when you do special orders... prepare to wait.  My husband and I waited almost 30 minutes for a Italian cheese bread and when we got our pizza, the sauce was burnt!!! Yes they are $5 pizzas, but I can get better quality if I pay $1 more at dominos."}
{"text":"Called ahead with a special order for pick-up. Half cheese and half sausage with extra cheese and light sauce along with 3 regular pizzas. My order was ready when I got there 15 minutes later. Get home and my pizza is hot and perfect to my special order. Much appreciated ."}
{"text":"Just waited 28 minutes for a\"hot and ready\" 2 crazy breads and some wings.  And the wings were already ready.  There is no reason for this amount of wait time when I could see at least 3-4 employees in the back that should've been preparing."}
{"text":"First time at this Little Caesars location very fast quick and not to mention very affordable and fresh. they also gave me extra ranch sauce with no charge.   very modern and upgraded with the flat screen menu very clean.  The service was excellent. Definitely will come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Their deep dishes when they're fresh and ready are pretty good I like when they have monthly specials"}
{"text":"Can't complain about a 5 dollar pizza , but at this location \"hot and ready \"means I have to wait 5 to 7 mins for a pizza . Sure the pizza is right out the oven , but it defeats the purpose of having pizza \"hot and ready.\" Maybe it's just this location that seems to never have anything ready , and the teens working there a very confused and lack motivation . My kids really like there pizza or else I wouldn't even bother stoping in ."}
{"text":"Little Caesars Deep dish Pizza taste very good! $8.00 for a pepperoni pan pizza is very cheap! The pizza dough has a buttery taste, crispy edges, with tasty pepperoni. My concern was the guy making the crazy bread. He was touching the crazy bread, without gloves, rubbed his nose and then was touching his cell phone too while touching the bread. It seemed like he placed his palms on it to check the temperature of the bread. They didn't have any pizzas ready so I had to wait 10 minutes for my order."}
{"text":"Customer Service could have been better, didn't ask to 'see ID' as indecated on my bank card, then when I offered for him to check it, 'oh, we don't check unless it is over $25.' Really?! Even though its indecating, you still won't check unless it 'over' an X amount? Another store did check, as requested. I don't think I will be returning to this store. Customer Service is alway Number 1 and making the customer feel welcome, regaurdless how busy you are. Dispite the companies popularity and how fast and ready it is, I dont think I will be Returning here. Plus the guy ran my card twice, threw the first copy away. So i will be checking the bank to make sure i wasnt doubled charged."}
{"text":"Little Caesars, bar none, is the best pizza bargain in this city.  Their Hot and Ready pizzas are a stack of basic, yet delicious pizzas that you can walk in, grab and go.  Yep!  No waiting.  Grab your basic pizza, pay the nice man or gal and... go!  If you want a little more than their basic, its only an 8 minute wait!  By the time I sit down, check-in on yelp, and respond to an email or two on my iphone, DING! Pizza's done!   As for the taste.  Well, I'm not a pizza connoisseur, but by my palate, it is tasty!  Its not a high quality pizza, but it doesn't have to be for $5 for a medium!  It is much better than palatable.  The two of us devoured it in 15 minutes.  No talking.  Lots of eating.  As far as any suggestions for improvement.... I have none.  It is very good, it is exceptionally fast and convenient and the best bargain in the city at $5 for a basic, and under $10 for most medium pizzas."}
{"text":"They use all fresh ingredients here,  mozzarella, tomato sauce & dough.  They stand out from the rest of the Little Caesars. Their pizzas smell delicious & they took less than 5 minutes for a FRESH HOT pizza. They apologized to us about the wait, even though it wasn't long.  SUPER FAST & most important friendly service  with a smile, even at rush hour (6 PM)! I may actually come back just because they seem to care.  The reviews made me cringe but they must of changed the staff. However I did not pick up this pizza for myself it's for a family member.  But even his coworker was saying he comes here for pizza often."}
{"text":"The reason why they never have pizzas ready is because they on there phones. I seen an employe on his phone didn't even try to go to the back and hide. They need to hire new people and get these pizzas going the 30 minute wait every time I come here is getting old"}
{"text":"This location always has pizza available and takes phone orders so everything is fresh and ready for when you pick up. They also do a great job of giving you the scoop on new pizzas and when a pizza is leaving or coming back."}
{"text":"This location never ever ever has hot and ready pizza. It does not matter what time you go in, it doesn't matter if it's empty or full, they will never have pizza just ready to go when you walk in. Not cheese not pepperoni not anything not ever, be prepared to wait at least seven minutes.  Update:  notice the complete empty drawers at 6pm on a Saturday. I asked how long on my cheese pizza after ordering. Cashier left. Never came back or gave answer. Still waiting for my two cheese pizzas...I'm so hungry."}
{"text":"place is way too slow. we waited 1 hour for 2 \"hot n ready\" pizzas. how is this okay? horrible customer service with slow employees. if this is a corporate owned store you guys need to fix this and you guys suck."}
{"text":"We get some custom vegan pizza from here every once in awhile and we dig it!  Our usual order is the veggie pizza, no cheese, plus banana peppers & pineapple. Their crust & sauce is vegan, making it a good option for us. It's quite tasty! We also normally add an order of crazy bread with no parmesan cheese.  Staff is normally friendly and professional. Food is made quick, even for made-from-scratch orders like ours."}
{"text":"Wish i could give zero i call my order in drive 20 mins to pick it up and every single time it's not ready! The managers have zero regard! Will be contacting general managers and corporate."}
{"text":"Little Caesars in their infinite wisdom decided to close the one down on Bell and 44th St, which was the ONLY Little Caesars worth half a crap. Oh well, I guess I have to drive another 15 minutes further away to the little gem on Union Hills and 7th St. Here goes...  Little Caesars HQ needs to close this one down. Its the pits! Went in there a few weeks back, wanted two cheese pizzas. I was told \"sorry, we don't have any. Can you wait 10 minutes?\" Ugh, I guess... \"hot and ready\" my butt! Whatever. I wait 10 minutes after driving over 30 minutes to get there. She calls my name, gives me my pizzas and out I go. I drive 30 minutes back home, open the boxes and find two pepperoni pizzas. GRRRR!!!! I check the receipt and it shows two pepperoni. This wasn't even my order. We call and complain, and after a few minutes the manager Tracy finally says she will give us two free pizzas for the inconvenience. Thank you, I guess. You still wasted an hour of my time and a few gallons of gas.  Fast forward to last weekend. I forgot I had the offer from Tracy, so I decided to jump in the car on a Saturday afternoon and drive all the way out to Timbuktu to pick them up. I get there, show them my receipt with Tracy's name, and ask for two cheese pizzas. I get \"sorry, we don't have any, can you wait 15 minutes?\" Are you kidding me?!?!! What sucks the most is that I have no option at this point but to wait because I didn't just waste a long drive for nothing. I get the pizzas, check them for accuracy, and begin the trek home. I get home, take a bite, and YUCK! There is so much sauce that its inedible. I'm not talking just SOME sauce, I'm talking about a TON of sauce. So much that we were all pulling the cheese back and taking spoons to shovel it off.   I will never go back to this location. Its maddening how inept that entire store crew is. They're rude, slow, unforgiving, unprepared, and unprofessional. Little Caesars HQ would do themselves best to shutter this joint and put it out of its own misery."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!! I love little Caesars but this one is horrendous. The pizza was hard, like it was put in the oven twice. It was full of new cheese on top and old cheese underneath the new cheese. Blah. We ate 2 pizzas from the box and had to throw it away. I also saw the people in the back using there bare hands with no gloves putting the cheese on the pizza. Ugh! I'm getting nauseas thinking about it. I really shouldn't have ate it, now that I think about it. But unfortunately I was starving and quickly felt full after I ate a few bites because it grossed me out.  I called Corporate so they are aware. No wonder why they have almost no stars."}
{"text":"Not the greatest at customer service.  I've seen pizzas in the warmer behind the cashier for a bit before getting to the point of distributing it to the customer who has already paid.  I've never been a huge fan but when I was there the place had 10+ people waiting and not much guidance.  The people were pointing out their pizzas being done to the cashier."}
{"text":"Like any great relationship, lower your expectations and standards in advance and you won't be disappointed. It's quick and it's cheap, like a good ole standbye. And if you catch them while they're hot out of the oven, boy are you in for a treat! Dominoes is classy, but she's expensive and quite a drive. Why fool around with steak when there's hamburger at home?  In all seriousness. If you're short on money but want a cheap thrill, it's not bad."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 7 times already and the pizzas were not hot and ready any of those times and the wait is about 5-10 mins for the pizza. So if your in a rush u might want to call ahead b4 u show up. On the plus side the Pizza  quality is good and consistent."}
{"text":"A year ago, I'd have given this location negative 5 stars.  They don't know how to handle call-in orders.  We called in for 2 cheese pizzas and 2 crazy bread  We knew to call ahead b/c they rarely (never) have hot and ready cheese.  When we got there to get the pizza, they had, and even told us, accidentally sold our phoned-in-20-minutes-ago order to a walk-in.  Duh!!!!!!  Label the orders, ugh!  We ended up waiting another 20 minutes for them to remake it only b/c our kids are LC fanatics.  The last couple of months they \"seem\" to be getting better, but we're still waiting for another mix-up.  It can be very disorganized at times."}
{"text":"Not really much to say...basic pizza for super cheap. Pizza is always hot n ready. Kinda feel like Costco Pizza is a bit more bang for your buck then this pizza joint. But it's still decent pizza."}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed with the pizza we purchased from this location last night. This was the first time I have ever returned take out food. Unlike the normal soft risen crust that all our past Little Ceasar's pizzaS have had, this was hard and and much flatter. When I expressed my concern the young man politely offered to have another one made. The second one came out with the same style crust. When i questioned again as to why the crust was different a young lady expressed this is their new crust. I took this pizza home. It was the worst tasting pizza my Husband and I have ever had. I' ve had cheap frozen pizza's that tasted better. I called another location and they confirmed Little Ceasars has not changed their crust. They also indicated that sometimes a crust wont rise and when that happens that pizza should not be sold. Obviously this location doesnt care about the quality of food they provide to their customers."}
{"text":"It is a pretty good pizza at a very cheap price.  I purchased a 3 meat regular pizza and pepperoni stuffed pan pizza.    Cost was $20.  You are limited on toppings (probably why the pizza is inexpensive).  The pizza was actually really good.   I will go back.  Unfortunately, we will be eating pizza for the next several days."}
{"text":"Been here several times its never taken forever as today. .. came in and orderd at 4:11pm its 4.30 now i only orderd 1 pizza and crazy bread still standing here  its not the girls fault (cashier) but i see people in the back not doing anything .. theres about at least 13 costumers in here and she keeps asking for change and nobody helps her where is the maneger ?? At its ridicules how they just have her working by herself  with alot of people in the back not doing anything.. worst visit ever... !!!!  Its 4:36 btw and still nothing!"}
{"text":"20 minutes for cheesy breadsticks only to get home and the dough wasn't fully cooked. Tons of people in the back but absolutely no sense of direction .  Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have always had somewhat of a speedy service, but today I had no choice but to complain. I arrived around 1:50 and stood in line for about 30 mins. I was LITERALLY next in line and no one was on the register. Someone behind me then yelled if anybody is taking orders and someone came and said \"Oh sorry didn't notice you guys in here.\" Got my food, but disappointed. I might just go to the little caesars down the street from here. I received my Pizza right away but still, I don't think the register should be left unattended."}
{"text":"Thanks for making me have to go out and buy a pizza cutter to cut my own deep dish. If that's what I wanted to do I could have just bought frozen pizza from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had.... Worse than when I waited two hours for a delivery that was supposed to take 45..... If I could I would give lower than one star.... We placed an order the night before since we were having a kids party the next day we were told the order would be ready at 430 the next day.....we walked in at 427 and yes it was busy.... We were told that they were short staffed and our pizzas would be another 5mins..... After sitting there for 45 mins we watched numerous people walk in get pizza and walk out.... Including some one that had came in ordered 7 pizzas and immediately got their order and left.... I'm pretty sure in all of that our pizzas were given away."}
{"text":"Called before I went in to get my deep dish they said no need to order and when I arrived she said there going to be a 10 min thanks for making me miss half of my sons game"}
{"text":"Well I wish I could say something positive but I  honestly have never have waited this long at any little ceasers. I'm actually writing this review while I'm still sitting in the lobby.  I got here at 930pm, and it's now 10:04. When I ordered the guy behind the counter wasn't happy that I was here, but there was 5 other people waiting for pizza.   I talked to some of them about their orders and everyone except for one person had only ordered 2 hot and readys. The other person only one.  Not only that but I would not recommend coming to this place late at night. Tons of sketchy people, bums, and people asking for money. I never thought I would be complaining about speed from lil ceasers.  And now they are complaining about the amount of people/orders they have to deal with it. I get it, it sucks that we ordered before you closed, but I was even here 30 minutes prior and I'm still waiting.  If you want pizza, order delivery. You will get it faster, not wait in a lobby for 30 minutes, and save on gas!"}
{"text":"No complaints but also nothing to brag about. I got here first thing as they opened on a Saturday and there was already a small line waiting to order their pizza. They lady in front of me ordered 6 pizzas right off the bat and I had to get 8 for a party.  They staff of three that was there actually did a good job getting everything done and out in a fair amount of time. So....you get what you get, and you don't throw a fit."}
{"text":"Slowest service of any pizza place ever. Every time I come here I wait 30 minutes for a Hot and \"ready\". I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"After a long day at work an after picking up my kids from school, I decided to stop by this location which is located in Tempe, Az off of Broadway & Rural. I sent my oldest daughter in to place an order for hot n ready pepperoni pizza and some crazy bread as well. Normally I would stop at one that's much closer to my job on the way home but decided to stop at this one. Well, it was a bad decision to go to this location cause everything was just wrong. First off they took at least 20-30 min. to complete my our order, then when they did complete the order we got home an everything seemed to be rushed an burnt as well. Especially the breadsticks. I took pictures to make sure I have proof of this. I will never go back to this location or recommend anyone to this location as this was the first an last time I'll go here. Bad service (20-30min wait) Bad food (Burnt pizza, Burnt breadsticks)"}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to get my order in. I come in 15 mins later when they said it would be done and once I pay they told me it's going to be another 8 min wait. 11 minutes have already past by and customers have been in and out the door by now with stacks of pizzas. Yet I'm still here waiting for ONE! Not to mention the girl at the register was a bit snotty with her attitude. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not come to this location keep driving and go to a different location. This place is constantly making you wait. It is supposed to be hot and ready pizza I have been here three or more times and every single time it's a long wait. The people are rude and the place is filthy."}
{"text":"I swear they work hard and make great pizza. I love their customer service. The pizza is ready and hot; I love pizza from them. Plussssd....cheap."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE NO pizzas ready. Told me 10 min and has already been 15 min and still nothing. Workers were rude and smarted off to me when I asked what the holdup was."}
{"text":"This location skimps on the cheese of the Extra Most Bestest. Especially when compared to the Cheyenne and MLK location. Go there instead."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and for a good price.  I always get the pepperoni and breadsticks. When I do get deep dish I am more than satisfied. Why the two stars? Food is always slow, there is never any \"hot and ready\" actually ready to go. The person at the front counter either doesn't care about greeting with a smile or they are too busy covering for whoever called off in the back that day. Idk if they are being cheap with hours or hiring the wrong people. I get it's inexpensive but in the past Little Ceasars was the place to go.  Now everyone I see that leaves here usually feels the same as me upset.  They only way to make it worth it is call ahead.  They will have you wait a little but calling ahead really helps."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the politeness of the front staff and the manager coaching which customers to pay focus to depending on time. I ordered 6 pizzas a week in advance and they took my order correctly and had me on my way right as soon as I told them I'd be coming. Two thumbs up for this location!!"}
{"text":"The thing about Little Caesars is this: it's five dollars. The old saying applies here: you get what you pay for. Sure they fall behind and you may have to wait for pizza. It's not some gourmet five star restaurant. The pizza itself is okay and it'll feed and fill you up when you're hungry and don't have a lot of money on you. I've had to wait for my pizza on multiple occasions but it's not the end of the world. The people who do work here look grim and pissed off for a reason: you'd look the same way if you were paid $8 an hour shoving out pizzas all day."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, and love it. The price is right and the deep dish crust is awesome. I would prefer a little less sauce though."}
{"text":"Sure am glad I can call an order in ahead of time to be ready fo pick up, and then sit and wait 15 minutes for my order to be a ready!! The staff here is ridiculous, unsanitary and a bunch of kids pissing around not knowing how to do their jobs!! Everyone at this location needs a lesson in food safety and handling"}
{"text":"My whole family has been throwing up all night after eating pizza from here! Will never have Little Caesars again!"}
{"text":"They can't make change...terrible customer service . employee was rude and snotty. .she needs to get an education in customer service. ..Young black girl with horrible manners!"}
{"text":"This little Caesar is the best one in north las vegas ...Quick and efficient. The one Durango has terrible customer service...wanted to try a bacon wrap pizza and the durango store employee said they didn't make them anymore...I knew that the special might be gone but wanted one badly...you know can't go wrong with bacon period!  Lol....the lone mountain store happily said yes when I asked...my business will go here...thanks"}
{"text":"Rude bitch at the register. No personality, no customer service skills. It is Sunday at 6:45 pm on 6-5-2016. Who ever is working the register. Will never go back to this place. And I will be complaining to owners or corporate!!!!! So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing, food was so great the place was packed and I waited for about 45 minutes to get my five dollar hot-n-ready pizza."}
{"text":"Decided to get some pizza so I came here at 9pm and ordered 1 cheese and 1 pepperoni. The wait was super long about 35 minutes to get my order. A lot of customers were complaining. Will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I do not recommend going to this location what so ever. Please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. Absolutely nothing hot n ready. While waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. Please do not waste your money and time here. I grew up with little Caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and I have never had such a bad experience food wise I have never left a little Caesars Pizza and thought I was ripped off but this location had me felling like I was ripped off which I was and you will be too. Please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location."}
{"text":"This Little Caesar's is about as much fun as a visit to a demilitarized zone, and about as friendly and fun. I say this with an already reasonable standard of what to expect from a Little Caesar's. I have been popping in here for years despite the location in a really rough strip mall, but I no longer will be.   Consistently, with my last several visits: Always rundown and dirty in the lobby, and set up in a way that if you sit down, anyone who is standing has an their ass directly in your face.  They seem to only hire rude high school kids. They can't seem to communicate with you, until they are telling you off.  They do not care if a homeless guy is in there panhandling or harassing you. One time while I was waiting, a guy followed a woman in screaming at her for not giving him change. They pretended not to notice this screaming guy in the lobby harassing their customers?   One of my guilty pleasure foods is their pretzel crust pizza. Gourmet, it is not, but sometimes I want to pound a few slices of cheesy junk food.   My last two experiences: I call in my order. The girl tells me about five to six times, I have to be in by a certain time to get my pizza - though she keeps telling me this after getting halfway through the sentence that is getting my order started. When I tell her I'm on my way home and will be dropping in, she begins copping an attitude about if I \"will be there or not.\" She finally takes my order, it takes two tries.   Today: There is a sign IN THE STORE and a flier I got in my mailbox...saying the pretzel crust is \"Hot'n'Ready\" from 4-8 pm. So, at 7, I decide to stop in and grab a pretzel crust, because f*ck my body. The girl says you can only call those in, and it'll be 15-20 minutes. I pass on that since I didn't feel like being stuck there for that long, and inquire about when they are actually ready, since the sign says 4-8. I wasn't rude about it, I just want to know when I can get a friggin pretzel crust without a twenty minute wait. She proceeds to get pissy and say they are never ready to go, order only, and it \"doesn't matter what the sign says.\" okay. And let me throw in that the family on the register next to me was there for two customers in front of me, waiting, because the girl needed her manager - but just shouted his name instead of going and getting the guy."}
{"text":"Why don't the employees here wear gloves when making the Pizzas? What's under your fingernails? Do you wash your hands?"}
{"text":"My local Little Caesars where I can get Hot-N-Ready pizzas. The quality of the pizzas have improved over the years and they have added more to their menu such as a deep dish pizza option, and dips to give a variety to their customers. The employees here do their best to keep up with the orders and demand that are brought during peak hours, which I appreciate. Overall, a great place to get some quick pizzas to go."}
{"text":"We went here around here 11am today. I waited in the car while my friend went inside and picked up the order. The two employees we dealt with were nice. The manager(supervisor)  and cashier both handled our order. We ordered an upgraded pizza with extra cheese and pepperoni, 2 liter pepsi, and dipping sauce. The pizza was hot and tasted fresh. Paying the $1 for the extra cheese really makes the pizza taste extra delicious. I highly recommend this location. This review is ONLY for this location."}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if it had that option! I freakin hate this place! They have the worst customer service you could imagine..  I called for pickup & ordered one pepporoni pizza with crazy crust (secret menu item) all over& crazy bread. Girl who answered the phone sounded so rude & unhelpful. She responded with \" PEPPERONI PIZZA AND HUH?!\" & she said \" I DONT KNOW WHAT THAT IS HOLD ON!!\"Okay first off I dont expect all the workers to know what it is but you couldve asked me what it was without having an attitude! I said \" cancel my order I dont want to order from this location anymore\" & I hung up!  I called back & demanded to talk with a supervisor & I told him what happend. He responded with \"yeah she talks like that to me too.\" Like okay? Thats not an excuse its your damn job.You He said \"what can I do for you?\" I told him \"I just needed to let you know about your employee but what could you do for me? \" he said \" i could offer you a free pizza, what was your order?\" I told him what I ordered and drove back to that location.  I got there an it was a long line & you could see about 7 people waiting on the sides for their food still. There was only ONE person working the cashier and it was a really timid boy I would say hes still in high school & he started freaking out because a bunch of people were still waiting for their food& they started complaining. He asked for help & his supervisor or no one else even helped him. I felt bad for him!   then when i got there I told them I called & asked for the supervisor that I talked with. They looked up my name & they told me completely different order.. They said I ordered a deep dish with crazy bread. I said no thats not my pizza & the manager kept saying \"well thats what I have in here\" well change it?? I obviously know what my damn order is! He fixed it & he said total is 15 dollars or something & I said\" waaait hold on you told me the pizza was free\" he said \"no I said the deep dish pizza was free\" thats when I started getting mad. I told him\" well first of all thats not what I ordered & you said free pizza\" & he started changing his story and said \" i didnt say anything was free at all I just said a discount\"  i was getting so mad already like you have the audacity to keep arguing with me? He should of just resolved the problem but he just kept going on and on!! Then he said \"theres nothing I can do theres people waiting\" I said \" okay I understand that! But ive been waiting too & im just trying to get my family dinner just like everyone else! You should treat every customer equal!\"   He just kept constantly dissagreeing , debating& talking when all he couldve done was honor what he said on the phone! I walked away paid 7 dollars! Even the guy at the cashier said he wants to quit because they treat their employees so wrong. I cant even deal with their customer service!! It sucks! their pizza is good but i dont want to buy from such annoying people!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service we used to order over the phone and then come in and pay even tho the pizza wasn't ready the cashier her name is shyla k she didn't let me pay cuz she said she needs the manager approval but when my pizza was ready there was no manager she was very rude"}
{"text":"I love Little Caesars but don't come to this location on Val Vista and Southern if you're starving or in a hurry. It requires patience. If their cheese bread weren't so addicting I'd probably just go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Hot, fast, cheap. Employees are all great at customer service. Have seen customers get indignant that a $4 cheese pizza is not ready. C'mon now it's a $4 pizza and it's dinner time. Spend another dollar and get a pepperoni pizza and your wait problem is solved."}
{"text":"Illiterate trainee dropouts working there. Unable to keep up with the dinner time rush. Worst little Cesar I've ever seen. Never going back"}
{"text":"Please don't come here and expect them to get your order correct. They will mess your order up-then they will take another 45 minutes to correct it. I've been to MANY other Little Ceasars in the valley and have never had a bad experience until THIS location. Save yourself the agony and order pizza ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"The Attitude Of The Young Man Who Answered The Phone Yesterday When I Called To Make A Order Was UNBELIEVABLE !!!!! If You Don't Like People, Then You Shouldn't Be In customer Service...I'm Just Saying ( Nasty )"}
{"text":"I hate Little Caesars. I've always found the pizza company to be abysmal and disgusting. This is by far one of the worst Little Caesars I have ever experienced. I've ordered bland, cheap pizzas that are not even hot and ready. The employees working there should be ashamed of themselves too. It sickens me beyond belief that these workers slack off to death, and frankly, I can definitely see why everyone else hates this location. It also bugs me beyond belief that my friend Marco had experienced some of the most abysmal service I've seen in my life. The clerk was slacking off and not taking orders for him, making him wait 60+ minutes for his pizza. It bugs me this kept many other customers waiting, it is sickening! Overall, this place is trashy, ugly, and above all, isn't even worth a waste of 5 dollars."}
{"text":"What can I say? Five bucks for a pizza? You can't beat it. Granted, it's not Chicago Style or something you'd expect to find in Italy, but for the money and convenience, it's hard to beat. Add some crazy bread and wings and you've got a pretty darn good meal for next to nothing. If you want to spend a little extra and get their deep dish, you won't be dissappointed. All in all, a good meal at a great price. They have also taken phone orders from me in the past, which even adds to the convenience. In a pinch and can't decide what's for dinner? Pizza! Pizza!"}
{"text":"Not good.  Apparently they were really busy but that's no excuse for a poor product.  It was sloppy, too much sauce and the cheese was clumpy...and slid half off the pie!  The taste fell short too, it was strange...it just tasted like sauce and cheese together (I know what you're thinking: yea...it's pizza! ...but there was really no more to it than that, the bread was overwhelmed by the sauce and there was no seasoning or awesome pizza-y taste).  So, do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for some other pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"No Hot-N-Ready's!  The girl at the register was very polite and apologetic but this place is not managed well.  The guy before me ordered 1 Hot-N-Ready and left because he was told there was a wait.  Management needs to get it together."}
{"text":"No communication between the staff here. I have been sitting here waiting for 10 minutes for 1 order of crazy bread.  While I was waiting another lady came in and ordered.  As the order of bread came out they gave my Bread to her. I asked why they gave her my bread and they could not answer.  Not even I'm sorry.  Do not come here"}
{"text":"Place is pretty busy but my hot and ready was just that so not too shabby. It is still just a five dollar pizza don't expect restaurant quality."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff with hot bread sticks and pizza during busy times. I learned tonight this store treats their staff to an order of bread stick after their worked shift.  I don't know if this is all stores or just this location but great job franchise owner for taking care of the staff."}
{"text":"Hot and Ready? Not even. When I ordered my Hot & Ready I was even told that there are other orders in front of me. There's a Papa Murphys in the same parking lot. Buy your pizza there. You can at least wait for it to cook at home. Not to mention the place is under. Under construction or something. Not sure I want drywall dust in my pizza."}
{"text":"The staff is nice and they do a good. The problem I'm having is that every time I go there the pan handling is out of control. Today it's a guy begging me to help him out and five feet away it's another guy asking to clean they're car windows for cash. This particular store is so bad. I'm considering going to another store location!"}
{"text":"Never once has anything ever been hot or ready at this location. I've gone multiple times and always have to wait 10-15 minutes for truly bad pizza, even by little ceasars standards. Seems like the staff is full of incompetent teenagers who don't give a fuck. For the time and money you could actually get good quality food at any local pizza joint and save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"It's always smart to call in your order. Then it's ready for you to pick up when you get there . Great price on pizza I have done two big orders 1 of 11 pizzas and 1 of 22 pizzas and both times it was ready at the time that I wanted to pick it up. It was hot fresh and ready to go. 22 pizzas cost $118.00 not bad to feed 90 people.   I called in my order a couple hours early because it was a lot of Pizza the guy on the phone was very helpful friendly and wasn't intimidated by my 22 pizza order.  When I arrived it musta taking me less than 5 minutes to pick up my Pizza pay for it and load them into the car and I will definitely be back.   job well done"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible! Little Caesars is all about \"hot and ready\" and speed. This location will NOT pick up the phone no matter how many times you call them in a row.. I attempted to call this location 15 time's when I was on my way to work and in a hurry, they never pick up the phone so I thought maybe they were busy except when I walked in there was nobody there and all the employees were sitting on their ass watching videos on their phone. I had to wait around to place my order so I started running late for work but while I was sitting there I decided to call the phone number again to see if they would pick up and 5 times in a row they didn't pick up because they were too busy playing on your cell phones... Never again will I come to this horrible location and if your in a parrot I suggest you don't either..."}
{"text":"all things considered this place rocks.   Price, speed, quality all 5 stars.   The wings are good too, nice pepper flavor in there."}
{"text":"Best $8 deep dish pizza I have had in a while. Food is hot and ready just as advertised and makes for a quick easy meal when your on the go!"}
{"text":"Good hot food, both locations I have gone to have been great. Love the food, price and people are always friendly."}
{"text":"It's great for what it is. Cheap pizza kids will eat next to the beach. The official pizza of every local bday party, hockey party or soccer wind up."}
{"text":"It's Called \"Hot And Ready\" Not \"Sit in Our Hot Ass lobby And wait 15 Minutes For Your Order\" I swear Been here over 10 Times And they never have any pizzas ready! I always walk out! They would make a lot more money if they just did their job and kept it stalked up! I have never been able to buy anything from here cause they never have pizzas ready!"}
{"text":"I called ahead to make sure the pizza I wanted was ready. They said glad you called and it will be ready in 10 mins and took my name for the order. When I showed up 12 mins later the pizza wasn't even put in the oven yet. You had one job! Be honest"}
{"text":"This is pretty standard as far as Little Caesar's go, nothing really that stands out from any other of these locations around the valley.    Though I will give credit to the people in the kitchen for the hustle on the turnaround of pizzas. So good job on the speed!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, they told me my 1 pizza would be ready in 10 minutes and it took them 45 minutes and had people that came after me get they're pizza before me, very frustrated with the lack of customer service skills here, bunch of teenagers having fun and cracking jokes in the back of the place. Never coming back here again, I give them 0 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"As much as the name gives it away, it's just bad pizza. Yeah it's $5, but it's not that good compared to other takeout pizzas like North End Pizza, Hungry Howies, and even Dominoes and Pizza Hut! Just not all that, and I don't need to eat that again"}
{"text":"It's Little Caesars Pizza...consistent, good pizza for the money.  This is a new location that just opened, so it's clean, fast, and up to standards.  As far as little Caesars pizza goes, this is a 5-star."}
{"text":"3rd time again. It's 11:15am on a Monday. Came in to get a hot and ready pizza. Don't have any again, have to wait. They should call this the \"have to wait 10 minutes\" deal. Still can't get it right. Thumbs down to whoever is managing this place or even if there is one.    2nd time I came here and they do not have the o so famous \"hot n ready.\"  The first time was because they didn't anticipate the \"dinner rush\". This time was because they didn't have the boxes so they couldn't make the pizza. WTF????!!!!  I mean really?  There is a reason why they have over 70 reviews and only have a 1.5 star rating. PLEASE franchise owner Le store manager step up ur game to have happier customers. It's not rocket science!  There's no hard formula, just have the hot n ready ready. So disappointed. Second time I walked out of this place pissed."}
{"text":"The pizza is so fresh and the crust is very soft and crunchy where it needs to be. They are such a great price for the product. We use them all the time."}
{"text":"I love this Little Caesars' Pizza! They always have yummy pizzas hot and fresh and ready to go for a great price. It's been a god-send when I've been running late to work and haven't had time to pack a meal."}
{"text":"Always liked Little Caesars pizzas and loved this location since they opened couple years back. I hate the deep dish pizza, but that's a company product problem. I think they operate pretty well, the place is always looking clean and the food is made right....most of the time. I've only had less than handful of times where the pizzas were not cooked right, like not long enough or too much cheese or sauce. That's bound to happen since we get pizzas from them 2-3 times a month. The only thing that they need to continue working on is cutting the pizzas all the way through. I have gotten pizzas half the time or more often not cut through and had to use my own pizza cutter."}
{"text":"Literally, worst Little Caesar's location ever. I don't typically prefer their pizza, but since it's supposed to be Hot and Ready, it's sometimes a good choice if we're in a hurry. There's always an issue when I go into the location, and they are usually NOT Hot and Ready. Today, I went in at lunch time which I expect to be a busier time, and there was NO pizza ready at all. I was told 10-15 minutes. Not a big deal in the big scheme of things, but the only draw for me to little Caesars is the \"Hot and Ready\" part. If I have to wait 15 minutes, I'm going somewhere that has tasty pizza. Which is what I did, since I had to wait."}
{"text":"Went into this location and ordered Italian Cheese Bread, as my husband went to the DQ next door and went we got home opened the box to find it missing something"}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience here. The service is always top notch and the staff is very courteous.  It is one of my regular places to visit on my lunch break."}
{"text":"My experience was a long time ago, but I feel the need to review to warn you guys. This is probably the WORST food service experience that I've ever had.  It was a weekday and my boyfriend and I had his large family over, and little caesars is always our first go to. We walk in expecting to have to wait because we were ordering 8 pizzas (4 pepperoni 4 sausage), so we place out order and watch the lunch crowd pile up. 20 minutes later, we haven't heard anything about our pizzas so I go ask and she says they're still making them so I say okay and sit down. Then as I'm sitting I realize people who were there after us were receiving pizzas. I sat in that incredibly small lobby for 45 minutes, watched the kitchen staff slack and finally got the pizzas that are supposed to be ready when I get there(I understand it was 8 pizzas but still). The worst part, I didn't even get an apology for the wait.  Like I said, worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here today was very disappointed  we got the new stuff crust deep dish and it was not done it was dough on the inside very nasty"}
{"text":"I see numerous times touching money or register than food prep.  Yuck.  Food is decent for price."}
{"text":"Pretty quick. The waiting came from the bread sticks. Cashier was nice and friendly. My only complaint is the bread sticks were burnt."}
{"text":"This location is probably the slowest I have been to. I came here because it was on the way to my friends house and all I wanted was wings and some bread sticks.  As I was walking in, i overheard another couple being told they would get free wings because apparently their overn was not working and the couple had already been waiting for almost an hour. I asked how long, the girl behind the counter told me about 15 minutes and I agreed to wait. Mind you I only ordered TWO items.  30 minutes later I am still waiting, the couple is also still waiting, other people are now waiting, the only ones going are the ones just coming in for the already ready pizzas. I am now watching another gentleman get his stuff before me despite having ordered AFTER I did, the hour couple finally got their stuff and had an issue with a pizza being wrong, other couples or people are still waiting. And finally the manager comes around and asks the other young lady at the counter what id been waiting for. Her companion asks my name,  I tell her, and the manager says they need to get my order out because people should not be waiting, at which point the young woman tells him my order has been ready she just hasnt gotten to it yet.  Number one priority at any business, you serve those who are already waiting before you serve others. She should have stopped taking orders, looked behind her, handed out those orders already finished, and THEN took new ones. It is not acceptable that I am stuck waiting while my food is just sitting because she can't be bothered to do her job accordingly and multi task. I watched them throw away pizzas from orders who didn't show up, watched them get orders wrong, and watched people sit and wait for quiet awhile, most getting their food long before I did even though I was there first.  Very poorly managed location, I'll stick with the one on Pecos and Windmill."}
{"text":"Four stars because they told me it would be 10 minutes but actually took 45 because they \"forgot to put in my order when I called\". I called 5 minutes ahead of me arriving.  Thankfully the dude behind the counter paid for my meal because I was about to be super upset. Thank you, whoever you were."}
{"text":"I think this place has gotten even worse. They have no idea what people have ordered or what needs to be made.  The HOT-N-READY zone never has anything ready to go.  Whoever owns this place is asleep at the switch."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza here a couple of times before? without any problems. Today I walked in ordered 5 pizzas, was told 20 minutes. It has been 50 minutes now..... Still no pizza. I could have gone to the back and made all of my order and been out the door. Get your crap together!"}
{"text":"I want to give zero stars. This place is incompetent. I walk in no one is there(445pm) no cheese bread or crazy bread. She say ten minutes so I order a deep dish half pep half cheese. Wait 15 minutes and ask her for progress, we are still the only ones in their. She's comes back and tells me they forgot to make my pizza. They still didn't have cheese bread. Did I mention my 4 year old is there and ready to lose it because he is dead set on cheese bread. How can you use the term hot and ready when they almost never had hot and ready when I go there. Just in case the manager reads this it was today 9 Feb. I will go to a different location, or just get delivery from dominos. I would take a picture of the pizza but oh wait I didn't get one."}
{"text":"Since my last review they still stink as a matter of fact our pizzas were all burnt. And when I tried to call after my husband got home, surprise! No answer!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? When I have a craving for some fast easy pizza, I come here. My recommendation is you place your order ahead of time and come a little after they tell you for picking up because it isn't always ready when you get there."}
{"text":"They don't have a clue what is going on thank god for the manager doing everything! And the employees where out in parking lot getting high!"}
{"text":"Never fails every time. I walk into this location at least 10 people in line. The employee at register always looks and works like a 10 year old child. Employees have no,people skills, experience nor can multi-tasks."}
{"text":"So my pops called and wanted some 5 dollar pizzas and what better place to stop than little Caesars.  There only one I could think of and this was the location.  As many places I've been here many times before.  I don't look forward to coming to this location because it's right next to a bus stop and people linger around like zombies at night.    It's next to a gas station and pocket change.  It kind of has that section eight feel to it.  My goal was to get in and out with 10 dollars worth of pizza.  Tonight they were packed and I waited in line for a few minutes.  Tonight was the first time that I've seen several people actually waiting for pizzas.  Special orders for them.  When I was called I asked for 2 five dollar pizza.  She rung me up and I was out of there.  Of course as I'm leaving I was asked for money by someone hanging by the door.  My spidey senses alerted me that I was about to get asked for money.    As for the pizza....it is what is is.  A lot of bread....little cheese and little pepperoni.  It's 5 bucks so you can't expect much.  At least here I know I will get little cheese as to where if I order it and ask for extra cheese I never get it."}
{"text":"Been disappointed with this place recently. Got some crazy bread and the it was completely undercooked. I was eating raw garlic covered dough. This last time I ordered from here I opened my cheese pizza to see 3/4 was drowning in sauce. I don't like too much sauce and I could barely taste the cheese. Bleh!"}
{"text":"Love their deep dish pepperoni pizza . Too filling n tasty . Slurp slurp ! Concept is nice , pizza are most of time ready"}
{"text":"This place is a joke I order a hot and ready all I got was not hot or ready don't waste your time at this little Caesars nobody know what they are doing there management is a joke"}
{"text":"This location has went downhill!! The cashiers attitude is not good! He use to be friendly but now his attitude is like he hates his job. Whenever the door opens and customers come in he rolls his eyes. This location is convenient but the service sucks!! The pizza is not the way that it use to be.. At least the crew that's in the kitchen seem to be more friendlier!!"}
{"text":"Worst little Caesar's on earth.  I joked with the manager \"I guess hot and ready doesn't mean hot and ready.\"  She told me \"You don't know how many times a day I hear that.\"  Clearly this place is run extremely poorly.    This of course was after she gave another customer directions to the Little Caesar's over on Lone Mountain and Decatur.  Oh yeah, best part, when I stepped out to the register I asked \"What's ready?\"  The young man at the counter told me, \"Uhh pretty much nothing.\"  We went to Roberto's across the street.  Was served in less time than it took for me to find out Little Ceasars had no food ready.  Yay Roberto's.  Boo Little Caesars"}
{"text":"I would love to comment on the pizza, but they never have any \"Hot and Ready\" when you get there. Literally EVERY SINGLE TIME it is a minimum` 20 minute wait...kind of defeats the purpose of their business model. I highly recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I order using the app pizza said it was gonna be ready at 4:12 it was ready at 4:30 I ask the girl my app said 4:12 she said not sure but it's coming.  This little Caesars  Customer service sucks"}
{"text":"This place has the WORST service of any pizza place that we've ever tried in Henderson. AVIOD AT ALL COSTS, frozen pizza from your house will be a more pleasurable experience. They outright lie that it's a 20 minute wait, it was an hour. That have four POS terminals with only ONE person working. The staff is all untrained kids, no seasoned supervision."}
{"text":"Called ahead at 7:20 pm for the advertise box set and was told there's no need to call ahead, arrived at the Tempe in 6 minutes and was told there's none ready, I had to wait 10 minutes. Walked out. Why advertise no waiting, even when we called ahead, we still had to wait....back to Pizza Hut where you can call ahead. Tom"}
{"text":"C'mon guys, this is Little Caesars we're talking about.  The family and I have frequented this location far more than I care to admit.  Sure, maybe a time or two we've had to wait a few minutes and who can blame the poor workers for not being too enthused?  Doesn't take away from the fact this has is a consistent and solid location as far as LC goes.  Can't beat the price and convenience especially if you have kids!"}
{"text":"I've order from this place(specifically this location) many times and I've always took the high road and held my tongue but not this time!! I will NEVER buy a hot and ready pizza from them again. I opened my box when I got home and for one...it looked like it was baked 10 hours ago, two..their was literally almost no cheese. One slice literally just had cheese and pepperoni, and 3...their crazy bread used to be so fresh, hot and delicious. Now I buy it and it's stiff and barely any of that butter seasoning they brush in it.. Little Ceasars used to be my favorite pizza place in the 90s and early 2000s but ever since they went Cheap and introduced hot and ready they shot themselves in the food quality wise. I wish they believed in quality not quantity."}
{"text":"So unorganized with prep and getting the pizzas out to everyone it was ridiculous to watch I waited about 10 minutes to get my \"hot and ready\" pizza"}
{"text":"I went in at about 3 to get a stuffed crust pizza which is hot and ready from 4-8 so I had to wait about 15 mins but the guy that helped me and made my pizza did a great job. Best pizza I've ever had from little Caesars!"}
{"text":"As I waited for my pizzas I watched the guys making it.   Really old guy was eatting while he beat the dough.  Young kids making jokes and smacking each other.  No one really cared about what they were doing.  I waited 15 min for the pizza.  As in moat cases you pay for what you get.  Cleanliness and pride in your job don't exactly fit in a $5 pizza joint.  As I leave the old guy is eatting pizza with one hand and beatting the dough with the other.  Wiping hos mouth with the back of his hand.  I think I will pay more.& hope for better somewhere else"}
{"text":"Hmm...  Where to begin...?  The store is small and could easily be missed as you drove by.  The outside wasn't exactly clean and I sure wouldn't feel comfortable sending a high school-aged child over there on their own to get me a pizza.  We went specifically to try the bacon wrapped pizza and after we ate it, we weren't exactly impressed.  The sauce was plain, the cheese was a little chewy and the crust was burnt.  The bacon on the edges was too thin, so when it cooked, it just became dried out and crunchy.  The breadsticks were still doughy and the marinara sauce on the side was cold.  The only thing this location had going for it, was the professionalism of the Manager as another customer berated her for not having any \"Fresh & Ready\" pizzas when he walked in.  The only other comment is that there were random people, possibly employees, that were walking behind the counter and then back outside, all while combing their hair and wearing sloppy, dirty clothes in the same areas that they were preparing food.  We will probably buy pizza from Little Caesars again, but it probably won't be from this location."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but this location is a freaking mess. Every time I'm in the staff can't handle the multi-tasking, they can't take care of the orders, keep track of who's next or provide service. To be honest it's almost uncomfortable to be in the lobby because all the customers are so irritated and the staff is so clueless. I know you don't come to Little Cesar's for awesome customer service but if you mess up someone's order or it's taking twice as long as you said it would I think a simple \"I'm sorry, we'll make it right\" goes a long way. In defense of the staff it's always busy."}
{"text":"I stopped by to buy two pepperoni pizzas they had none ready so I order them they told me it was gonna be 20 minutes. I waited and waited and nothing but they were busy so I was being patient. Another customer comes by and she orders 2 pepperoni and 2 cheese pizzas and she gets them right away! That's when I decided to ask if my pizza was ready and the guys face was like (oh I forgot about you) he didn't say that but by he's face expression I could tell. He's like let me check comes back and says it's gonna take longer because we're out of dough LOL I'm sure he gave the other customer my pizza!! I just asked for my money back I didn't wanna wait an hour for 2 pizzas."}
{"text":"Always understaffed. Doesn't help when their are whinny women exaggerating the time they spent waiting for their pizza when their is a room full of people waiting. I think the customers are more inconsiderate than the employees"}
{"text":"This Little Caesar's has been here for decades. And, they're still making it good.  I called the night before a party, asking what time they opened and if they would have the Hot & Ready pizzas first thing in the morning (10:30AM). The person I talked to said they didn't want me to clean them out for the other clientele coming in for them, so asked if he could take my order, separately, and then the pizzas would be there for me. SURE!!! I showed up right at opening. Friendly staff. Order ready. Bing, bang, boom. Gone."}
{"text":"Hot, Fresh, and Ready. What more could you ask for for a dinner of pizza, wings, and crazy bread. Not a 5-star restaurant, but if it's pizza you want, pizza you get. No need to call in, just go in and grab it. Still love Little Caesar's after all these year."}
{"text":"I'm wrong.  I came back.  Mostly because they figured out the promotion.  and I can get lunch for under $3 (on Mondays and Tuesdays).  I still love crazy bread, so I'm happy,"}
{"text":"\"Hot 'n Ready\" is plastered all over this establishment, yet the pizza you'll receive will be neither hot nor ready.  I called ahead for a standard pizza and crazy bread order during dinner rush.  I was told on the phone I'd have to be there in \"15 to 12 minutes.\"  I said, \"what was that??\" The girl again repeated \"15 to 12.\"  I said, \"did you say 15 to 12?\" She said yes. Hmm. This tells you a lot about the caliber of employee working here.  I get to the store in 15 minutes and there is a line of disgruntled patrons standing around.  There are literally only 2 pizzas in the warmer.  No bread, no wings, no other PIZZA.  No one is at the counter.  The phone is ringing.  Where is everyone??  Finally someone comes out and I said I was there for my call ahead order. She says \"oh we have to wait for the bread.\"  Hmmm, ok.  Tick tock, I'm now 23-25 minutes post ordering and finally the bread is done.  A girl brings up the bread and a pizza that's been sitting in the back the entire time.  I said \"wait, has this been sitting out this whole time?\" She smiled and said \"it has!\"  I said I don't understand why when the warmer is essentially empty.  Another girl who is apparently in charge of solely cutting one pizza every 7 minutes came out from the back and said it hadn't been sitting out for \"more than 10 minutes.\"  Wtf??  I have a 15 minute drive ahead of me, but whatever.  The ineptitude of the teenagers working here is unbelievable.  No one waiting for their food was happy nor satisfied.  What's worse -- the employees are oblivious!  How are you a \"Hot 'n Ready\" pizza joint and don't have pizza ready for the dinner rush???  Not a single person who came in was able to grab and go.  If I wanted to wait 20+ minutes for a pizza, I'd go to a place with better quality ingredients.  This place is a sorry excuse for a convenient pizza place."}
{"text":"The absolute worst Little Caesar's I have ever been to. I'm not sure why I continue to go, especially since each time I go, it's the same situation. I call to place an order at least 15 minutes before I am going to get there, then they tell me my order will be ready in 15 minutes, then I arrive and pay, then they tell me my food will be ready shortly, then I end up waiting another 15-30 minutes for my food. What's the point of calling ahead? Also, what's the point of calling it \"hot and ready pizza\" if the pizza is never actually ready when you get there? (Also I've had super good experiences with other Little Caesar's locations in the past- it's just this one that doesn't have it together)"}
{"text":"Came here  to get a pizza today and they charge me almost $15 for a deep dish with 2 toppings.  I ask for my money back and the worker has attitude.  Pizza is not worth the money there are better pizza places around here without the attitude. Stay away."}
{"text":"Called in for five pizzas and they told me it would be ready in 15 minutes. When I went down there they said they couldn't find my order. Finally spoke to the manager and he told me that he talked to the entire staff and they didn't recall speaking to me. What happened to the customer is always right? So I chose papa johns instead."}
{"text":"Slow service. Had to wait for hit and ready. No communication. Very slow. Very very sad."}
{"text":"Know many workers there , say it's dirty, don't wash dishes and food stays out and worse of all smoke in the walk in freeZer !Many that eat there are sick like I was ! Don't eat here , customer service is horrible too, nothing is ever hot and ready long wait !  Waited half a hour for 4 pizzas .. pathetic"}
{"text":"Hot and ready? Lol this place is a joke. They themselves weren't ready for anybody to order pizza. Been waiting over 15 minutes since time of this review for 2 pizzas claiming to be hot and ready. Still plenty of people in front of me too. Will never return to this location ever!"}
{"text":"Got a Ultimate Supreme Pizza and an order of wings to carry out for under $16, can't go wrong with that!! Pizza was \"OK\", they could've baked it a little longer. There are lots variety of wings, which is nice, you don't stuck to just one or two flavors. The restaurant looks pretty new and clean."}
{"text":"Why is the bacon wrapped pizza (the only good thing on the menu) Gone?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Really? I couldn't be because sales weren't good . Every time I was in there that was all people were asking for .  Bad business call . The one thing I want on a fuggin cheat day and its gone.   Who runs this place? Brutus?"}
{"text":"Good location. Friendly cashier.  Lobby is clean. However .... Why do you say hot and ready when it is not the truth. Waiting 8 minutes.  It's 1123.  They opened at 1030.  Why do they not have any pizzas ready?!?!"}
{"text":"This location is terrible terrible service. They wait too long to serve you and then once your order is put in it's about 45 minute wait before you get your hot and ready pizza. Terrible service. Never come here"}
{"text":"I would like to propose a brief test to determine the likelihood of whether or not you will enjoy your experience at Little Casesar's.  Please answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the following questions:  1. Are you drunk?  If you answered \"Yes\" - congratulations!  You'll enjoy your experience here finding a cheap and quick way to get some food in your stomach and to sober up enough to stumble home.  Bonus points if you are in walking distance to the location from Lakewood's divey east-end bars so as not to endanger anyone trying to drive here to pick up a hot-and-ready.  If you answered \"No\" and somehow still want to try this out.  Please smash a tomato onto a piece of toast that has been dunked in butter and sprinkle cheese and toppings where desired.  You'll thank me later for saving you the money and the hassle."}
{"text":"This teenager ran business never has anything ready, could get a real pizza for the time you have to wait."}
{"text":"Never have the pizza's ready, even when your order WAY ahead of time. Always an excuse as to why your order isn't in the computer.  Yeah, its' their fault but too bad, you still have to wait another 30 minutes.  Going to write corporate.  There is no way this location is managed right."}
{"text":"Pizza is mediocre, but if you call the order in and pick it up - the service is great. Don't go to a busy Little Caesars location and expect to get a pizza in less than half an hour. Best to call it in."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Little Caesars in Vegas!! Every single time I come either at the quoted time of my order or a few minutes after and it is never ready! It seems like the staff here CANNOT communicate!   They're trying to be laid back and \"cool\" but it just comes across as childish and unprofessional! I get that it's a fast food restaurant but I feel like a better management team could make these kids provide a better atmosphere!  Tonight I placed my order over the phone. Was quoted 15 minutes, came after 20 and they had no idea where my order had gone. The one guy working the counter had to walk around the back asking everyone if they'd seen my order. So I came back out to my car to write this review!  The counter had broken coin wrappers and old receipts littered all over it.   Another team mate came up and argued with the one guy working the counter about when her break was.   Where is the leadership in this place?!?"}
{"text":"This location had STRUGGLES! I always call my order in and it is never ready in time! Today I called it in at 8:05 pm. They said it would be 15 minutes. Showed up at 8:30 pm giving them plenty of time and THEY HADNT EVEN STARTED IT YET! Their sense of customer service, accuracy and urgency is very lacking! When you talk to anyone here they are very mono tone and robotic. C'mon guys let's get some personality!!"}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service EVER! I'm taking it her name is Jane or whatever but that girl is SUPER RUDE! She starts saying \"what do you want?\" I thought the proper greeting is \"How can I help you\"? Well I was not helped at all. So I order my pizza and I asked her for garlic sauce on my pizza. She didn't even put it on my order.. SO SHE MADE ME order it again, and pay when it should've been on my order the first time. Finally after 20 minutes of waiting for two pizzas she gave me someone else's order. Like really how hard is it to do pizza. Yall hiring cause yall need better workers that know what they doing with at least good customer service. One word DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"This was one of the very first drive thru little ceasars I ever saw. It has never disappointed when it comes to providing fast ready made pizza. I personally love the deep dish and I think for cost and speed you can't really compete. Do I think it's the best pizza in the city no, but if you add ease, price and accessibility than it's definitely a top pizza place. Also who doesn't love crazy bread! Service has always been friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Easy 3 stars, the pizza is what it is. The customer service is pretty good. Even when they are crowded you still get greeted and treated :)"}
{"text":"Come here if you feel like eating taco bell. This place sucks. They never have pizzas ready and when you order online they won't get your order and still charge you for it. I feel bad for the staff they seem like they're trying but they just can't get it right."}
{"text":"Ordered a pretzel pizza from here and asked for a lesser amount of salt then the pizza usually comes with... Low and behold my pizza had no salt on the pretzel crust at all, was slightly burnt and the actual topping didn't start until it was halfway through the slice....the customer service 1-800 number had an automated message stating they were closed, so I attempted to call the location and I spoke with the same kid that made the pizza... Ryan I think his name was... He didn't care to help me with the situation and he assumed we wouldn't drive that far out for a replacement pizza now.... He was very rude and inexperienced with making these pizzas. I will never come to this location again!"}
{"text":"I get pizza here once a week, fast and cheep.  Not sure why, but lately they don't have the 8.00 one hot and ready after 4pm. Only pepperoni, no  supreme, no pretzel crust, no deep dish or 3 meats. I'm on my way home and just want to run in get it and go. Now I have to settle for only one kind, I guess I'll just order it from pizza Hut have them deliver it will I'm relaxing at home, not sitting in the little lobby."}
{"text":"Hot and ready my butt! Anytime after 6 usually have to wait 15-30 minutes for a pizza. It's 8:00pm and have Been waiting 15 mins  so far on one pepperoni pizza. Don't advertise as such if you can't deliver on the promise. Very dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Fast food pizza, got to love it. I ordered 2 pep and it was out in 2 seconds. But that's what they're known for so you can't really go for the speedy service. I was greeted and taken care of promptly. I got home after making a brief stop at someone's house and the pizza was still hot. It tasted great too. Nothing to complain about here except for the location. Kind of ghetto."}
{"text":"If I could give this little Caesars a zero star I would. I will never again order pizza from here online or over the phone. I love little Caesars but I'd rather spend the extra money to order pizza somewhere else. They got my order wrong plus I called in to verify my online order and add another sausage pizza but when my husband arrived they said they never recieved my order even though they had already taken out of my card. Then it took them almost an hour for them just to still get the order wrong giving him only two pizzas and telling him they were giving him one free when I ordered 3. How are they giving me one free when they didn't give me the pepperoni I ordered online. I paid for what they gave me and they want to say there giving me something free are you kidding me. They also said they were going to give him free bread sticks for messing up but forgot to make it and wanted him to wait even longer. They also wanted to give him some other lady order without checking it. They are so unorganized and rude over the phone. I will definitely be writing to little Caesars themselves so they can do something because all there doing is loosing customers cause of their employees and for how unorganized they are"}
{"text":"The first time I came to this location I found a hair in my pizza! I gave it a second chance and thankfully there was not hair this time. Also, the person at the counter was super nice this time and had a clean shirt which was not the case the first time I visited this location."}
{"text":"I'd have to say this is one of the better Little Caesar's locations I've been to in the last few years.  They are also one of the busiest I've seen, so that makes the consistency I've experienced much more impressive.  A lot of people complain about it, but I like that there's usually a slight wait for a pizza.. It guarantees freshness. I've never come away from this location without a hot pizza, which means when I get it home, it's still very desirable.  Other locations have stacks of them ready, but in my experience, those are always just warm enough to call hot and by the time I get it to the table it's barely warm and the cheese is rubbery. So I'm okay with this exceptionally busy little caeser's and make a point to come here.  Today I went in to pick up a Hot and Ready pepperoni and there was a delay because of the traffic.  The kid at the counter was very courteous and kept apologizing to everyone waiting. He even offered complimentary dipping sauces, which he didn't have to do.  Of course, the pizza arrived hot and the presentation and taste was better than expected.  Can't really complain too much about a $5 pizza. Really good taste and value for such a low price."}
{"text":"Sadly even though the food is good, This location only gets 3 stars for their limited menu availibility.  Even during the times the menu says items are hot and ready, they aren't.  Poor management if this is still an issue after repeated reviews saying the same thing."}
{"text":"This is my first time to get pizza from Little Caesars.  My husband wanted to their pizza.  I think he wanted to re-live so childhood or something.  LOL!!  I ordered a large supreme and 3 meats pizza.  Then I ordered 2 orders of garlic and parm chicken wings and 1 order of the lemon pepper wings.  So the cashier rung me up and $34+.  I handed him the debt card and he said, oh we can only take cash our machines are not working.  Really, he could have told me before I ordered.  I had to walk next door to Fresh & Easy to buy something so I can get cash back.  =(    The pizza and chicken wings were ok.  I wouldn't get them again."}
{"text":"Just kind of curious what pizza place does not give out red pepper seeds and parmesan cheese you guys use to and now have stoped it's okay to have cheep pizza but doesn't mean you have to be a cheep company least you can afford an oven unlike papa Murphy's..."}
{"text":"My 2nd review in Yelp about this location! I just want to say I drive from Scottsdale over here because the staff is SO nice especially Jeremy. He always takes care of me! Also my pizza is good!  Thanx you!!!"}
{"text":"Can you try to cut a pizza evenly and all the way through. Kinda welcoming. Took and ate anyway because I got Father's Day to myself"}
{"text":"Let me put it this way if you are not Hispanic expect to get the \"stare down\" to why this person is at this location. There is a guy with glasses with full on tats who seemed to be spacing out when I was trying to give my order.   The pizza is disgusting too. It tastes like glue that's fresh off the bottle made by Elmers."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Pizza wasnt ready at quoted time. Front counter guy and manager were rude."}
{"text":"$5 Hot and Ready right around the corner from my house.  Love it."}
{"text":"It's great that most of their items are ready to pick up when you walk through their door. Had a 10 minute wait for an order of the deep dish pizza. It would be an added bonus if they had paper plates to go."}
{"text":"This place is close to home. I have no choice but to go to this horrible location.   I gave this location multiple chances. The crew takes forever to make pizza. There is never hot n ready pizza ready. Today I had to wait 10 minutes to order my pizza. (Mind you, I was the first one in line with 6 other people waiting behind me). Then after ordering my pizza it took 15 minutes to receive my hot n ready 5$ pizza and bread sticks.   Last month, I literally had to wait 30 minutes for two hot n readys and wings! This place is horrible! Horrible crew. So rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I've been here there are no hot and ready pizzas ready to go.  The franchise owner runs this restaurant with a skeleton crew.  I feel badly for the people working here because everyone is mad because they are waiting so long.  I was told a pepperoni pizza would be ready in 10 minutes, 20 minutes later I am still here."}
{"text":"Went to this location. Ordered Pizza, while I waited watched the girls prepare Pizza. Cashier handled cash and without washing hands started preparing Pizza with NO GLOVES. Another girl preparing Pizza had long nails and NO GLOVES. I'm pretty sure that is unhygienic and a way for spreading unwanted diseases."}
{"text":"These Little Caesars is fast with nice & friendly staff. I come to this location very often. But this was the first time something was wrong with our pizza. My daughter found a hair in the crust of the pizza. Yuck!  I can't really blame the location because I know the crust is pre-made & pre-packaged. But still YUCK."}
{"text":"Tonight was honestly a crazy experience.  We were probably there like 45 minutes waiting for 2 pizzas and some crazy bread.  I wish I had gotten the name of the girl working the register cause she was a rockstar!! She was trying so hard and everyone she worked with was incredibly incompetent.  They should just give the store to this girl at this point because everyone else there was useless.  It was hilarious.  She has brown glasses and blueish green hair.. please someone send help for this girl!!"}
{"text":"Their hot n ready pizzas were not ready. Had to wait 10-15 minutes. There were a bunch of workers who were acting childish, screaming and singing in the back. One of the workers had his shoes half way off and yelling at the people in the back as a joke. Gross since you're in the back making pizza. We asked the cashier to rinse the canned soda that we bought and the guy with his shoes half way off asked why. Cashier had to explain there was dust on the can. We stuck around because our friends asked us to stop by, other then that we would of ran out."}
{"text":"It's a convenient and cheap place to satisfy your pizza craving.  Nowhere near gourmet but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The Faster Mustache cycling team ordered 60 pizzas for a big event on a Saturday. Manager Lisa took the order and everything came out as expected. We are supper happy with our CLT Little Caesar's pizza experience. THANKS!"}
{"text":"Kind of like a one night stand, quick, dirty, cheap and you feel like crap in the morning."}
{"text":"Went their at 5 pm and no bread or pizzas ready.   What a joke only two people working.    Management obviously cares more about money than good customer service, avoid this place"}
{"text":"Came here just to order a pretty standard meal, one pizza, cheesy bread and a small order of wings. I've been waiting for well over 30 minutes with three screaming children in the car and I've had enough time to create a Yelp account just to complain and I'm still waiting. Absolutely ridiculous and they are handing everyone else there food but me. There's no reason for this wait and I will not be coming back. Most incompetent staff ever."}
{"text":"I don't believe that I have ever went to this location and wanted to only get a hot and ready pizza, and they never have them ready. What's the point in advertising the pizzas and then never having them ready for the customers"}
{"text":"If you want anything other than a large cheese or pepperoni pizza, expect to wait 10-25 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down. I called the health department today and I hope they shut it down. I would never recommend this location. Disgusting! I wouldn't let my dog eat anything from here !!!!"}
{"text":"I would like to say a word on this place there customer service on the phone is grate Straight to the point  There are grate and will kip coming back there  Very recommend this place to anyone..........."}
{"text":"My toddler loves pizza and sometimes he can't wait for me to bake a frozen pizza for him. Since this ends up about the same price as a frozen pizza it works out well! He's not too picky about his pizza yet and he's been known to eat two entire slices of this pizza in one sitting, a miracle for this kid who NEVER wants to eat! I'm so thankful this place is close to home!  Obviously it's not the fanciest pizza around but I'm pretty sure it's the cheapest and to be honest I even like to eat it too!"}
{"text":"Worst and most unorganized location in town.  Pizza never \"hot and ready\" like advertised and you generally have to wait about 20 min for a basic order.  None of the employees ever seem happy with their jobs, they clearly don't communicate with one another, and most of them have no idea what customer service means.  I know it's only $5 pizzas, but common courtesy to your customers is free!  Today I came to this location at 10:50 am (opening time is 10:30 am) and the doors were still locked.  I could see one employee inside messing with the safe and getting the drawer set up.  Shouldn't this have already been done?  Employee told me through the door that the manager didn't show up and it's gonna be at least another 20 min before he could start a pizza.  Clearly there is something seriously wrong at this location when the store manager doesn't even show up and leaves it to the employees to run the store.  I hope someone from corporate headquarters reads all reviews and cares enough to get over to this location and fix the issues in this store.  After today, it will be a long while before I visit this location and give them my business....if ever."}
{"text":"Got ultimate pizza supreme and pretzel pizza with pepperoni to go. Took about 10 minutes to get the order. Pizza was good will come back again."}
{"text":"It's a Miracle this place is still in business, the customer service is HORIBLE! I'm not even sure how they pass health codes, the guy making the pizza was also doing the register and handling money going back and making pizza without gloves or washing hands!?!? Between that and the little gang banger making the bread making smart ass comments, I strongly advise nobody to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I did a pick up order, they told me it would be ready in 15min, got to the store wait about 50 min, asked the girl at the front of me order was ready because I have been waiting 50 min when the told me 15, another customer was complaining about the same thing and was demanding a refund at the same time I was asking, the manager came out and told me they were waiting on 2 pizzas, I told her that I have already been waiting 50 min when you told me 15! She didn't care about my issue told me it would be out soon and walked away. This place needs new management or it is going to sink! I will not come here again there are plenty of other pizza places around here to go to"}
{"text":"This is Little Caesars, what more should I say. Guess what I do have more to say.  We had been at our son's competition all day and trust us we did not want to cook, so we dropped by and to pick up some pizzas for dinner for all of our boys. When we arrived we were greeted by two different employees, at the time of say hi back and making sure how many pizza's we were going to order, which they did not have ready at the very moment, the cashier immediately asked if there were cheese pizza's in the over and the answer was yes and they were coming out of the oven as she was speaking. Yes, we had to wait about one minute for pizza, but you know what to get it hot and fresh out of the oven, we can wait that one minute, what is one minute other than sixty second, but what made the wait enjoyable was the employee was great and friendly and made sure we knew exactly what was going on at that moment during our order.  Once the sixty second we're done, we were in the car heading home after a very long day and with the help of Little Creasers we had some fresh pizza and bread sticks. Thank you."}
{"text":"What is the point of calling in an order when you arrive and they don't even have your order in the system? Called in my order at 12:16 PM. I arrived 15 minutes later and they didn't even have my order. Waited for them to make me a new pizza which i finally got at 12:49 PM. Meanwhile the whole time I had to listen to the girl at the counter scream to her fellow employees for more pizzas, sauce cups and pizza labels. Is the price worth it?!???"}
{"text":"Zero stars... Never and I mean never have a cheese pizza ready for sale. Thought the whole premise was hot and ready? Pathetic."}
{"text":"Staff was super nice and super helpful. Came in later in the night and the offered to cook what we wanted. Kept giving us time updates. They were very quick, friendly, and professional. Even helped us get the cheapest deal on the combo. 5/5"}
{"text":"I am not a big pizza Eater but my kids, like most kids love it. This location is brand new and is nice and clean and how can u argue with a $5 pizza that is pretty fresh and ready when u get there. Also they give my kids little caeser's pizza cookies when we pick up..nice little touch. I know it isn't great high end pizza but they love it and the price is right."}
{"text":"Hot and Ready pizza? Not at this location. We frequent it once a wand once a week it's a 5 minute wait or longer. Calling ahead doesn't help either."}
{"text":"It's Little Caesar's so I'm not going to bother with reviewing the pizza. It's $5 and that's what it's worth. lol. What I am reviewing is the fact they are always out of Hot & Ready pizzas. They make you wait 15-20 minutes. I won't come back... might as well get \"real\" pizza if I gotta wait."}
{"text":"The sauce is terrible, zero flavor, dough is okay, toppings are not the best. As pizza goes, this is the bottom of the line."}
{"text":"Came in to the Little Caesars on trop 3.7 miles away from work to claim a free pizza coupon I received through email. The \"manager\" (oldest person there) and woman working there weren't able to punch the numbers of the coupon in on there POS system. They told me there is no way for them to do it. Sounded more like the two were ignorant towards their POS system. There is always a way. Those numbers are incase a barcode doesn't scan, they will also tell you if it's valid or not. So I drive 3.7 miles back to work without a pizza, would have bought it for $5, but they helped me decided it's not a bad idea not to eat here today. It looked like High School in between classes in there. Nobody working except the gentlemen in the back and cashier. All other women workers where gossiping and drinking Starbucks. Get your act together people! It's lunch time! We don't have time for your ignorance!!"}
{"text":"First visit to this location and am extremely disappointed.  Sad to know who served me is now getting 10/hr. I know someone could provide a way better customer experience than this person did for the same amount of money.  If I was a business owner I'd be firing a crew like this as I'd lose out on business.    First of all I arrived to find a hand drawn note on the door stating sorry we will open at 11, when they should have opened at 10:30a.   Second they opened after 11 and the guy had no customer service once he unlocked the door.  Once i  entered nothing was said to me I simply stood near the register waiting to be acknowledged.  The guy decided to continue working behind the registers while his coworker stood around and snacked on something before I eventually was acknowledged.    Thirdly, once I was acknowledged the guy asked what he could get for me.  I said I would like 3 hot and readys please.  He said my total  and then walked away before I could pay .  I continued to wait while he left me at the registers and went in the back area.    Fourthly,  I waited over 10 minutes watching him stack up multiple pizza boxes with pizzas,   put stickers on pizza boxes,  placed finished pizzas in the warmers,  watched his Co worker  had off a pizza to someone who just drove up to the drive through all while I still stood there waiting.    Fifthly, a third co worker eventually arrived and I asked her why that person received their order before me? She went to the back and words were said between her and the coworkers and she just disappears.    Finally the guy brings me my order stands at the register and just stares at me... I ask him  Oh are you ready for me to pay now??  He says yes and the total.    If I didn't have  a hard working team I wanted to appreciate I would have just left.  I chose to go through this experience to the end and now here I am. . I hope the owners read this and take discipline on those employees.  If you don't believe me.  Check your cameras."}
{"text":"First off..it's Little Ceasar's.  So...think whatever you will...but I don't think their pizza is all that bad.  It's hard to beat for a $5 also.  Quick dinner for 2.  This particular location, never had any problems.  In and out of the drive-thru, usually the same guy is there when I go through....they're quick to get you in and out.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Hi there! My name is Jenn. My fiancé and I were craving some little caesers tonight so she called to see when they closed because of the Labor Day holiday and thankfully you guys were open! I work down the street at petsmart and frequent this location. She said the lady on the phone was super nice and helpful! I went on around 710pm and Katrina was behind the counter. What a nice lady!!! She was helpful and polite and filled more order super fast!! Always a good price and great food here! Thanks so much for the great service. I myself use to work for you guys when I was 19! Anyways I do hope this comment finds her so she knows that people like me really do appreciate the hard work and great customer service! Thanks Katrina!! We will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! This Little Caesars has no idea what \"Hot & Ready\" means!! I just moved to RR 2 months ago, I have been here 3 times and they have NEVER had pizzas ready. It's always at least 15-20 mins wait... Forget it!"}
{"text":"Consistently long wait times and no pizza ready!!! I haven't been to this location in a while because of this issue... disappointed to find out still the same stupid issues going on"}
{"text":"Little Caesars has always been a fav pizza place for me.   Pricing is very good, selection is good, plus the deep dish pan is delicious.   Lunch specials are good that include a few slices of pizza and a pop.   Crazy bread are good but the cheese sticks are not good.   Wait times is ok at this location but they do take phone orders.   Overall looking for good pricing for pizza for a family dinner or a birthday party can't beat Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Called ahead for the second time for a deep dish pick up. They say on the phone 15-20 minutes. I've given them 40 minutes from the call time and I am still sitting here waiting... honestly  I don't think I don't think I should give them a third chance... I've watched multiple people walk in with called deliveries and leave in a timely manner. In fact I've managed to BS long enough during this review that we are almost at an hour since the call..... I guess ONLY purchases the hot and ready from this location..... I'm still freakin waiting..... this is annoying to the point where if I didn't walk up and pay 25minutes ago I'd walk out without the pizza and cheese bread...   Time of call 3:23 Time  of handed pizza 4:22"}
{"text":"I love the deep deep dish pizza, but it is never hot n ready during the hours it is supposed to be. We walk in, and walk right out. Always a room full of people waiting, and the workers don't care. They are understaffed, and the guy there looked like a strung out \"methhead.\""}
{"text":"I came to this location and the manager I spoke to a manager named Jared who was unprofessional, I had a problem with my order and I talked to her about giving me New crazy bread cause the ones I purchased tasted just like flour with no sauce and she told me I had to pay for  it anyways cause I already ate one but I didn't want those nasty bread sticks I wanted fresh ones. So with that being said I'm a very unsatisfied Customer. I'll probably start going to the one on lakemead and Decatur with better customer service."}
{"text":"My reccomendation: Italian Cheese Bread  Maybe I got there right after a big rush or something because absolutely nothing was \"hot-n-ready\". I had to wait for my pizzas and italian cheese bread. Took about 15-20 minutes.   I don't expect gourmet quality for a 5 dollar pizza, but geez, if they charged as much as other pizza places then Little Caesars would go out of business QUICK. Little Caesars pizza is strictly for someone looking for cheap/quick food. I honestly think most pizzas found in your local grocery store's freezers taste leagues above Caesars.   The Italian cheese bread is really good though. It is by far better tasting than the pizza but make sure you grab plenty of napkins and are stocked up on Proactiv because this dish's main ingredient is grease with a side of oil.  Customer service was good. The guy was very nice and funny. He was very apologetic for making me wait and even threw in a free bag of Crazy Bread."}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch combo today shortly after 11am when the lunch menu opens up...so I was expecting it to be hot n ready by the time I got there, but it wasnt.  The cashier that took my order quickly got one fresh out of the oven for me, my only complaint it was slightly over cooked.  Other than that it was great"}
{"text":"I went there on 1-05-17 and normally I don't expect much from Little Caesars because just like they saying goes, \"you get what you pay for\"...  The customer service I would rate about a 3 because it seemed no one knew what orders were suppose to be coming out...there were other customers inside who had stated they had been waiting a while for their specific orders.  While i was there, The cashier who waited on me, got an attitude with a customer that came in behind me.  When the customer asked if the order she placed on the table was, the cashier responded \"thats what your ordered isn't it\" in a very rude and sarcastic tone.  Not only that but my pizza was cold when I received it.  If I could avoid going on in to this location in the future I would."}
{"text":"Low expectations going in there because of the negative reviews surrounding this location but I had speedy service, hot & delicious crazy bread w/marinara. Most of the ratings I saw were old but I'd definitely give it another go!"}
{"text":"Too bad you can't put negative stars. This place is just dirty and disgusting overall. Cardboard is better. Only pizza in my life where I've had to pick off pepperoni and leave the crust as it was too gross to handle."}
{"text":"Never again is all I can say... Been waiting here for 30 minutes for one pizza and people who came in after ME who ordered more stuff have got there's before ME! Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"The last four or so times I have come here over the past few months, no matter what time of day, no matter what day of the week, I have to wait because their \"Hot and Ready\" pizzas are neither hot nor ready.  This is a problem that has persisted since before their remodel and it is getting a little out of control.  Management here badly needs to re-assess their sales projections and make sure they have product \"Hot and Ready\" as advertised and correct their preparation schedule."}
{"text":"Horrible service...didn't get my bread, was told would have to continue waiting after 20+ minutes and no one in front of me, others walking out with their orders that came in after me. Devonn was rude and a horrible representative...will NEVER go back and will tell everyone I know to do the same"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. No sense of urgency during busy time. It took almost 10 minutes to even be noticed or acknowledged. A line started forming and no one cared. HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Very poor quality of food and customer service. I got 2 hot n readys to feed my kids before I had to work and when we got home we realized while eating it that they were not cooked all the way through. The dough in half the pizzas was squishy and soft with a slight sour taste, as if they pulled the pizzas out of the oven too soon. When I called they remembered me as I was the only customer in there as soon as they opened yet I had to repeat myself to 2 separate people who didn't even apologize or offer to remedy the situation. Instead they said I would need to bring in the pizza or the receipt. I informed them that I couldnt go back as I was on my way to work and they didn't even give me a receipt. Not only did they make me waste my money on their mistake they made me waste a ton of time all for nothing. I would not recommend wasting your time or money with this establishment."}
{"text":"Well at first glance the pizza was burnt but look alright. A few slices in my friend found a huge black hair BAKED INTO the pizza. Disgusting. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"They didn't cut our pizza 2 days in a row and a young asian lady was very rude to us. They also tried charging us for an extra pizza with only giving us two. So we had to have the redo the whole thing and they made it look like our was our fault a line grew behind us."}
{"text":"As the rest have said, may be hot, but not ready for about 15 minutes.  If the owner of this location bothers to read this, I come to Caesars for the ready pizza.  I can wait for better pizza somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm usually very easy going with pizzas and didn't let the bad reviews get me down but now that I've had to sit in the Caron the way home with that horrible smell and then just to eat a slice and be even more disappointment and actually a little sick...  I will never go or recommended this place again!  I love gluttony and deep fried but this is just horrible pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"CHEAP PIZZA WITH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! That should be their motto!!!!   I was at the Von's near by around 12pm and need pizza for 6pm. I tired calling to place my order ahead of time but no one answered the phone. I decided to drive their since I was in the area.   I walk into Little Caesars and place my order Me: Could I order 5 hot and ready for 6pm please Worker: You know, next time you can call in the order Me: I tired, no one picked up the phone Worker: O (with a dumb look on his face) well your set for 6pm for 5 hot and ready pizza  6:00PM comes I show up Me: I'm here to pick up my 5 pizzas I order and paid for earlier today.  Worker: Let me get a manager for you  Manager Cory: Do you remember who took your order Me: It's on the paid receipt Manager Cory: Anyone uses anyone's cashier here and the names don't match   Me: I don't remember  Manager Cory: Do you remember anything? Me: Sorry I don't  Manager Cory: Well, this order isn't ready, it will take 15 mins  Me: Are you kidding me?  Manager Cory: We can give you a refund  Me: I need these pizza, I'll wait   This was the WORST customer service ever! Manager Cory didn't do anything to win my service, basically, it was my fault for not remembering who took my order. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service with rude and lazy workers.   After a long week of finals and stress, my fiancé and I decided to order in advance so we could pick up the pizza as soon as possible. I walk in and there's a line out the door. When I finally got in I realized there was a line out the door because even though there was two workers up front, only one of them was working. The guy was rushing around trying to serve everyone while the girl decided rush hour was a good time to count her till. I've worked with tills in several jobs, it takes a whole 2 minutes to count your drawer, and you count it when it's slow to not disturb customer service. She took 10 minutes to count, leaving her co-workers short handed and flustered. She obviously didn't want to be there.  I finally get up to the front and tell her I called in a to-go order (cheese pizza) and she recites my order back to me reading it off of the screen with my name. Goes in the back and I see her open a cheese pizza and put it down below. She comes back and says they don't have it even though I just saw them open a cheese pizza. Another man yells at me from the back telling me that they never received my order even though she had read it off to me from the computer. I'm not entirely sure why they did this. I understand it's busy and I'm normally a patient person but this was ridiculous.  I've ordered from this place several times, it's closest to my house. But I would rather drive farther and get treated like an actual customer than an annoyance. If you don't like your job, change it. They will no longer be receiving my business."}
{"text":"These employees are so unprofessional. They were yelling and joking, but it was about other customers and how they jokingly are going to start 'fights'. They were talking as if there were no customers there. There was a couple people there. I understand working with a younger crowd, but this was unacceptable when there's cussing and yelling. Out of the people there, 3 of them were friends of the workers. One was sitting on the counter while the other two occupied chairs and kept asking when their friends were clocking out. In front of customers! They kept asking customers \"what did you order?\" I got asked three times! My order took 20 minutes.   My boyfriend loves Little Caesars. I would never come back here again if it wasn't for him wanting to eat this pizza. I'm all for Little Caesars, but stay away from this location!"}
{"text":"Great staff/owners. Prices are the best in town for the quality. Splurge the extra dollar for the Extra Most Bestest.  Crazy bread is always worth it."}
{"text":"After making a curiosity call 1st w/o succes we decided to head over to this establishment. Arrived 15mins prior to closing. Only to be told there would be at least a  20min wait. Since their ovens had been down for over 1hr.Having just arrived to Vegas, and it was late I asked if there was any all cheese pizza premade. Make a long store short my fam n I got a premade cheese pizza n bread sticks with no sauce (worker forget to incl). Needless to say the employees was ready to close and go home for the night. In return we paid for a bag of lies#!!!!#/! I'm very disappointed with the service at this location. An a reply from a regional, district, and store manger regarding an explanation of how this issue will be resolved would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I think people are being a bit harsh.  The pizza is cheap, fast pizza.  Don't expect A high end product.  The staff has always been polite & helpful to myself & my teens.  If I don't want to wait I call ahead (usually as I'm driving home) and my order is correct & ready by the time I get there.y"}
{"text":"When they first started out they were great, but then they got greedy and started charging more! The $5 went to $6, now they're charging for the deductions. I wanted light sauce and I had paid the same price for light sauce (which is less) as if it was an extra topping! That's like requesting a meat lovers minus ham but, having to pay extra, that makes no sense!! It's ridiculous!!!!! LC, you're starting to lose your street cred!"}
{"text":"The WORST service ever!!  The young girl working the counter on 2/26/2015 at 7:30PM was rude, unprofessional and was obviously put out by us asking what pizza's were \"ready\".  She rolled her eyes when I had the audacity to ask for sauce with our bread order and harshly slammed her fingers into her computer screen when we changed our order to cheese pizza since it was ready to take out.  We should have been willing to wait the 15 minutes since the pizza in the warming box was cold and severely under cooked.  We ended up throwing away most of it.  We will never go back to this location!!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a pepperoni pizza and crazy bread. Took 30 minutes and they refunded 2 other people who waited longer then me and then wanted to charge me extra for marina. This is after at least 10 to 15 people came and left with their food who ordered after me. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I checked the last health inspection here before deciding to go and found they had failed for having roaches in the kitchen...will not go back, thats nasty."}
{"text":"Cashier couldn't take my order right. I kept repeating myself and she just wasn't getting it. Took FOREVER. there's plenty other Caesars you could go to without the crap. Then on top of it they made me wait and FORGOT ABOUT MY ORDER"}
{"text":"This location is so gross. The staff is extremely rude and the clientele is trashy. The pizza is mediocre at best and the wings were the worst I had ever had. The last time I was there, there was someone outside asking everyone for money and then spewing profanity when they didn't get any. Save yourself the trouble and go to another pizza place."}
{"text":"$5 pizzas....through a drive through window?  What's not to love.  Yes it's crappy pizza but when it comes time to feed a family of five like mine, nothing gets it done quicker and cheaper than Little Ceasars.  I'm in and out within minutes and two hot pies fills up five hungry mouths for $10 and some change.  Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Call before stopping if your with-in an hour of closing time. I came in and asked for the new stuffed crust deep dish. They didn't have any made so they declined my order and money.   I asked for the managers business card and was declined.   When I asked why they were declining the order they stated it was because the staff wanted to go home. I confirmed their hours of operation. I confirmed I was here with in their hours of operations.    Sadly this is Not the first time this happened."}
{"text":"The bad example of Little Caesar locations. I always order my pizza a certain way with additional toppings and they have about a 50% chance of getting it right,based on my many take out experiences. I either dont get the additional toppings i paid for or they ring it up as a different price half the time even though I order the same thing each time. I do not get the Hot-n-ready pizzas as they are Never ready. I get off a 5pm so yeah im hitting a rush and its busy everytime, but they know that too and it never changes. There is a Little Caesars pizza closer to my house which does a much better job, but this location is on my way home which should make it move convenient but it is not."}
{"text":"Rude. Walked in and didn't get a smile or any acknowledgement. Girl at the register looked like she didn't even want to be there. Attitude overload really. Once we FINALLY got our food she mumbled 'Have a nice day'. I understand working food service is hard at times, but don't show that attitude to people who spend their money at your establishment."}
{"text":"I was driving by and I seen that there was a little Caesars nearby and I just wanted a real cheap pizza as a cheat!  I walked in and seen the three meat pizza it was only eight dollars... the three meat pizza consist of pepperoni, sausage and bacon but I didn't want sausage and the store manager was working at the cash register and I told him I wasn't a fan of the sausage ...he explained how much he loves their sausage and I really should give it a try.... I asked if I can just have double pepperoni and bacon instead and he gladly switch that over it was so fresh and delicious that when I decide to have a cheat day I will definitely definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ok so I get it, it's little Caesars which I don't go in thinking that I'm going to get the worlds best pizza or best service. But lawd this place sucks. The cashiers weren't playing any attention to my order or anyone else's. Whatever drama was happening took more importance. There needs to be a better manger than what is there."}
{"text":"We went to this location and I walk in and get 2 cheese pizzas, 1 pepperoni and paid. I didn't think to check the pizzas before I left. But usually we go to this location for the freshest pizza. But this time it was not good. We went all the way back home and ate some and it was TERRIBLE! So we call them to exchange the pizza and they said that they would exchange the pizza for fresh ones. Second round was just as bad! The pizza was dry, over cooked, tasted like cardboard and very thin.   Will NOT go back here any time soon!"}
{"text":"Please explain what your meaning is of \"hot and ready\" bc it's never ready at this location!!! There is always a 15-20 min wait... This is literally the easiest thing to cook, the dough is already pre-balled it's not like it's hand tossed, come on people"}
{"text":"First of all they need to hire someone other than teens. Maybe someone with some life under their belt. Maybe someone who can smile and hold a conversation.   I tried to order the pizza with extra pepperoni, extra cheese that they advertise. No  one was in store, I was only one at drive through. They only had 1 pepperoni, one set wings and one set bread. It would take 5 minutes to get the ones I wanted. I said that it was fine, I paid and said that  I would wait 5 and would pull around to the front to not hold up the line. Girl at window said she would bring it out. I offered to also come in and get it, if she would just wave.   After 15 minutes, I sent daughter to see what was up. She asked and received blank stare and they went to the next customer.I came in and saw mass confusion in the back and had to wait in line. I also asked, another blank stare. I told cashier I would wait till she found out what was happening. After another 10 minutes I got my pizzas. No apologies, only pizzas thrust at me. -  During all this time, twelve people came out with pizzas, many with the same pizza type I had ordered.   I have ordered before and it has been slow. I am happy to wait, but bad service and lack of customer respect makes me not  want to every go there again. I don't put things on review sites, but I am hoping a manager will see this and address this issue so it does not happen again.Cheap pizza should not be indicative of cheap service."}
{"text":"Literally called twice and the phone rang for 2 min both times so I decided to eat the next nearest place by my work instead. Terrible."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza (3 pizzas and dessert) took 2.5 hours for us to get the pizza. And we couldn't get a refund. We didn't even get anything free for waiting so long. NEVER GO HERE. THEY ARE TERRIBLE. We watched them give our order to someone else and then they told us it would be another 10 minutes until we got our food. It was more like 30 minutes. Terrible."}
{"text":"If someone were to walk up to you and say, \"I've got a craving for some burnt pizza that tastes like flavored cardboard. Where can I get some?\" then be sure you tell them to go to Little Caesar's off Central near Baseline in Phoenix.   To be fair, Little Caesar's has never been my favorite brand of pizza. I knew what to expect in terms of taste and quality so I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal from this place. It had been years since I last had Little Caesar's so I figured I'd give it another shot. Little Caesar's is that brand of pizza you get either when you're craving pizza and are too impatient to wait until payday or you're just simply down on your luck. It's that brand of pizza you eat and smile to be polite when it's served at children's birthday parties or when your neighbors invite you to dinner but don't warn you beforehand.   Despite how bad the pizza was, there were a few good things about this place. The restaurant was clean and the cashier who took our order was polite."}
{"text":"Called in and ordered a custom pepperoni and mushroom deep dish.  Went to pick it up and they did not have it.  Was told that I could have a extra cheese and pepperoni instead.  Okay not the worst thing in the world.  Asked for a crazy bread and was told that they had some ready.  Guy who took my order asked if I wanted sauce.  I replied yes.  Get home and there was no sauce in the bag.  Guess I should've checked before leaving but I never pick up Little Ceasars so I didn't know that the sauce isn't put in the bag until my better half, who loves little ceasars, told me that it would have been on the side.  Whoops.  So at the end of the day I paid full price for a pizza I did not order and crazy bread without sauce.  To make matters worse my gf told me the same thing happened to her the last time she went there.  Since she is more persistent then me she ended up waiting for a new pizza to be made and got it for free.  While the pizza was good, the poor customer service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been a customer at this location from day one, since it has open. The quality is amazing and everything is constantly fresh. I usually grab their walk-in hot and ready medium pepperoni special. The staff are very knowledgeable and very patient with you."}
{"text":"Great customer service is hard to find! Keep up the great work!   I went for a quick bite to eat and pizza was \"hot and ready\" as promised. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. They never have ANY pizza ready, no matter what time of day it is. Staff could care less, and acts like they're stoned all the time. I don't care if it is a good deal, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Every time I walk in they have NO pizza. It's fucking ridiculous. My bar tries to go there all the time plus pre orders and it's just a shit show. I will not be using this business any longer."}
{"text":"This has to be the worse Little Caesars in Las Vegas and the upper Management needs to do a surprise visit to truly see them in action.  The cashier is so unprofessional in action and how she wore her uniform.  The manager is no better b/c he needs to correct these actions but he just watches.  The time of service was super long.  If they keep up this way this store will close down due to lost of business."}
{"text":"Fast service. I've never been disappointed dropping in to grab a couple of pizzas. I'm pleased that they opened this location so close to my house. We conveniently grab pizza @ least once a week and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Want to give a shout out to Gloria, best manager ever.  I left my purse behind after picking up our pizza and she really went the extra mile to find me.  I'm from out of state so I was really worrying about how I was going to get back on the airplane without my ID to fly home in a couple of days.  Thank you so much Gloria. You are a truly great person.  And the pizza was good also."}
{"text":"Some places have a lot of negative reviews and I try not to be influenced by them but reviews for this location are spot on. Went there for the first time tonight at 6:45pm to get a few boxes for my kid's soccer team. Guess what????? They're out of cheese pizza! Seriously! BUT they have lots of pepperoni. No long line...just out of the most basic of pizzas period. Weird.  Not coming back here again. That's for sure."}
{"text":"Not bad for quick kid food! Friendly service at this location. $10.81 for two pizzas! Ask for kid cookies-they're free with your order."}
{"text":"I know I know, with all the wonderful options we have for pizza in Cleveland why in the world would he choose Little Caesars?  But hear me out.  You'll understand when I'm finished......or so I hope.   First to understand this review you have to understand that I have an obsession no addiction to pizza.  Hot, cold, fresh, day old it doesn't really matter I love it all.  And when your as far gone as I am in when it comes to pizza,  it doesn't always have to be the best.  With that said Little Caesars has managed to become the McDonald's of the pizza world.  Its not your favorite, you know you could do better but time and time again you find yourself there.  You see much like McDonald's Little Caesars is great at nothing, however they shine when it comes to convenience, speed and pricing.  You see if i want a pizza and don't have time to call it in and wait the 30 minutes (aka 1 hour to everyone outside of the pizza making industry) your options have just vanished leaving you with only one choice \"pizza pizza. \" This leads me to the more important reason why i choose this fine establishment........nostalgia.  You see being that I acquired my addiction for pizza at a young age.  I have fond memories of the Little Ceasars pizza.  Such fond memories in fact that i can vividly remember blowing out candles on a Little Ceasars pizza on my birthday as i demanded this instead of cake (I hate cake.)  So you see Little Ceasars is more than just pizza to me. Its memories that just happen to come \"Hot and Ready\" in a cardboard box at just five bucks a pop."}
{"text":"I'm in here anytime I am in the area. Local kids selling fresh pizza. Always love seeing their faces as it reminds me of a million years ago when I worked fast food.   Ahhh memories.  Stuffed crazy bread, its a glorious thing people!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come to Lil Caesars we haven't been in a while and basically gave up on pizza because every place we have ordered or been has had a problem with they're pizza, I could not believe how hot and fresh it was, basically one of the best pizza's Vegas has,we were literally out the door in minutes quickest pick up of piping hot fresh crust and sauce good job guys!! We will be back.....loved the lemon pepper wings"}
{"text":"Late. Hungry. Thought I'd give it a shot. Jazzy service. Hot-n-ready? Not! Don't bother."}
{"text":"I always call ahead so it's ready when I get there and we don't always just get the hot n ready kind. It's still mediocre pizza but it is cheap so really can't complain to much about it. They usually pick up within three rings and take my order quick. Nice when your short on cash or time"}
{"text":"Service could be a lot better and faster. Reason we come to little Caesars is because of how fast the pizza and service is. We waited 20 minutes for a pizza and cinnamon loaded bites. We would have just ordered from papa johns or Pizza Hut if we knew we were going to wait for 20 minutes for something that normally takes 5-10 minutes which the cashier stated it would only take 5-10 minutes. We don't plan on coming back to this little Caesars."}
{"text":"Never have pizza's ready! We always have to wait 15+ mins for a pepperoni, on a Friday. Like, what do you do all day before the rush comes in..? Nothing!? Plus everytime the cashier is rude. Your suppose to have \"HOT N READY\" for a reason. False advertisement!"}
{"text":"It is never a wrong time for pizza so here I am at Little Caesars. There is also a plus in stopping here besides enjoying great pizza, I don't have to make it. With this priceless advice and such great prices on their pizza and assorted styles of bread it is a win win. This store as most is a to go store but I learned today that they even have lunch specials too. One can purchase a small individual size pizza,(this is a throw back such as the Pizza Hut individual deep dish pizza they used to sell), and a 20 oz bottle of a Pepsi product for $5. What a deal?  Although, I did not take advantage of this deal I was feeding the twins too. The cashier was very friendly and had a great sense of humor. I opted for a pepperoni pizza but with the extra most bestest. This pepperoni pizza has a better crust than the regular pepperoni pizza, but it has an abundant amount of pepperoni. It has been too long since I had tried there craze bread but it is just like I remembered it. The crazy bread goes best with their crazy marina sauce too. They have a delicious looking new item called Italian cheese bread and it was so great. The cheese bread had so much mozzarella and the garlic was delicious too in the crust. This is the way to celebrate Wednesday and not have to make lunch!"}
{"text":"My favorite little Caesars spot cuz they make it when you order it, not like other spots where they just keep the pizzas chilling all day. Always satisfied w/this place!"}
{"text":"The $5 hot and ready we grabbed for a quick dinner was lacking in sauce (literally none on it at all)...but did come with an added bonus of matted long black hair baked into the bottom of our crust.   Yeah...seriously...feeling multiple strands of hair literally ripping in my mouth when I take a bite is about as disgusting as I've ever experienced.   This is the last time we will ever visit this location...and probably the last time I'll have pizza for a while. Appetite ruined."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains, but $8 hot n ready deep dish pizza is seriously good. And only $8! Demand was so high on a Thursday night that they kept running out - the stuff coming out of the oven was literally hot and ready!"}
{"text":"\"Hot and Ready\"... YEAH RIGHT! We always wait for pizzas at this location. I go here in the evenings and it really doesn't matter which day of the week it is, there is still a line. It's very frustrating because they advertise Hot and READY, not Hot and Wait In The Lobby For 20 Minutes. The staff always seem stressed out and polite enough to not be rude, but definitely don't seem to be happy at all."}
{"text":"I think they should change the phrase HOT N READY. I been here past 3 times and I can say nothing was hot or ready. For few bucks more mind as well just order or pick up from dominos. Or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"\"Are machine is down\" things you hear when the place is backed up and nothing is ready. I asked a customer how long they been waiting and said 25-30min. Cashier is friendly but don't get me wrong telling your customer the machine is down is why your backed up is a lie. How are you taking my card and everyone else of the register is messed up. How are you making more pizza if the machine is messed up! Caught lying big time. I worked fast food before and when computer is down, you can tell it's down. I was told 10 min my pizza will be ready. I set my timer and so far time is up and bout to go past my time limit. Definitely not hot and ready BIG TIME!  Right now all I hear is gibberish in the back and it's not related to work. This place should hire people who want to work and need the money. People here working seem like they just in it for the heck of it and working at their own pace which is SLOW! No one is expediting, if I could go back there I would record every single one of them. I wonder if they even wash their hands cause the cashier here with glasses just touch a bunch of pizza. Almost 15 min in now and still no pizza. Come on I would have gone to pizza hut if this was the case. I've been here multiple time and never left a review till now because this is getting out of hand and its RIDICULOUS.  Alright so I spotted a girl working hard and an employee called her stephanie, now she working hard. After 35min I finally got my order WTF."}
{"text":"Keara is really good at customer service and was really good at communicating."}
{"text":"A good option if you want a cheap and quick meal, but service here is a bit on the slow side.   This location seems always so busy, but it was the closest location to where I used to live in Vegas so I'd come here whenever I wanted something quick. There was always a line if you came during lunch or dinner times and the workers never seemed able to keep up with the demand on the \"hot & ready\" pizzas. People would be complaining about how they didn't have any pizzas ready and how they had to wait around for something they pay $5 for..come on people! This is not a fancy pizza parlor and I do understand you come here to get something cheap and quick, but so do everyone else and I'm sure the workers are working as hard as they can to keep up with your pizza orders.   I normally wouldn't do the hot and ready option as I love their veggie pizza. I would order and have to wait around 15-20 minutes, so I'd go to the grocery store next door to pass time. After making my rounds in the grocery store, my pizza would be done.   For someone that isn't a huge pizza fan, I think that Little Caesar is a great option for me. I love how they cook the crust, not too crispy or too soft and doughy. They put a good amount of cheese and veggies on my pizza and are more than happy to customize it as well, like adding extra mushrooms or not putting peppers on it.   My only advice for this place would be to make sure you keep those shelves full of hot and ready pizza as people normally come in for them and don't want to have to wait around for something."}
{"text":"It's hot but not ready had to wait for pep pizza 10 min, so don't offer ready if it's not :("}
{"text":"Not the best location for quick service, but the employees are nice and this location is super clean.   Came in last weekend for a stuffed crust pepperoni pizza. They didn't have any already made, so they told me it would be about 15 minutes. After I had been there for 20 minutes I asked about the status of my order and they informed me that it would be another 5-10 minutes! What could possibly be taking them so long to pop a pizza into the oven? There were about 5 other people who ordered after me that got their orders immediately. Sure, they did just order regular pizzas, but still.   After about another 10 minutes I was informed by the girl at the register that they had made a mistake on my order and made the pizza just a cheese one without the pepperoni. I didn't want to wait around another 20-30 minutes so I told them I'd just take the cheese one. Would have been nice if they had told me sooner that they made a mistake.   They only had young kids, probably high schoolers working there and half of them I guess were on break as they kept on going over across the street to the gas station to get drinks and snacks.   If you are in a rush, I wouldn't recommend coming to this location, but if you have the time to wait, it's a great location. Like I said, the employees here were super friendly, just not really all the great at relaying information like messing up on orders. I'm not sure how long this location has been here, but it looked new and really clean inside."}
{"text":"Called in advance to order a pizza asked the man on the phone what's available he said everything was available so come down. After arriving nothing was ready for pick up had to sit and wait 10 min for my pizza. If the guy would have taken my order over the phone I would have been in and out.   Had issues with this store in the past nice to no nothing has changed.."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences EVER. If you're in the area and looking for a inexpensive meal to feed your family, DO NOT GO HERE. The experience itself will instantly make you regret it and wish you never bothered. I paid an extra $1 for an upgrade pizza since those were ready and I wouldn't have to wait forever. After I paid, I was told I still had to wait for the crazy bread, 10 mins. About 15 minutes later, another guy orders my exact order and didn't wait at all. My entire time there they kept switching orders or making people wait who ordered first. Incompetent imbeciles that's not worth your time."}
{"text":"The employees at this location are very rude. While I was placing my order i simply asked the woman taking my order to make sure my crazy bread was not burnt this time. She then proceeded to argue with me about it. A manager came out to see what was going on and eventually told me that I was no longer welcome in that store."}
{"text":"very Friendly service only thing to change is they need to make more pizzas for \"ready now\" because such a busy location. Lots of customers in and out."}
{"text":"This place can be so hit or miss!  if I am willing to wait for a fresh Pizza to be made and pay extra, why is it the pizza comes out with 2 slices missing cheese . When I question the employee helping me (tall guy with a man bun) he just smiles like all is well! He caught me on a good day as most often I would have asked politely to have the pizza remade!  This location always only has standing room only and with the update to there looks, seems as though it made the place smaller! The one thing they have neglected to fix is their entry door as it can close hard on a small person. I know this for a fact as my little one was hit by this door on a windy day as we were only walking passed this location."}
{"text":"They are always out of one of the hot and \"ready\" options and it's usually cheese pizza. Service is not great and if I wanted to wait 15 minutes for a pizza, I could have ordered it and picked it up elsewhere. If they are going to promote hot and ready, it should be ready. The pizza is really good for the price though so that is why I will return."}
{"text":"Pizza is forgotten  I have been to this little Caesar's Pizza 2 times. I called in my order both times. The first time I called and placed my order, 20 minutes passed from the time the order was placed till I arrived at the store. My order was either forgotten or was given away. Since my order was missing, they made another pizza and gave it to me for free. So all was forgiven until I ordered a second time.   The second time I ordered, which was a month later, I called in my order ahead of time just like before. The pizza was orders 23 minuets before I arrived. When I arrived, the pizza again was either never made or was given away. This time I was given a free drink. The free drink was nice but still very disappointed on how this Little Caesar's Pizza can never have my order by the time I arrive. I would like to continue buying pizza because of the convenience but looks like I will now go out of my way to go to another store."}
{"text":"Based on my one visit here I must say it's not too bad. You know what you're getting for the price. It's easy, cheap, great for parties and good enough. Picked up some pizzas for 5 hungry kiddos and I was in and out. Pizza tasted fresh, lots of pepperoni, and cooked just right."}
{"text":"**Before you post a review - think about how embarrassing it is to complain about $5 pizza** I have to give a huge shout out to this location!! One of the busiest locations I've seen and they handle it like pros. From the demand of pizzas - to the amount of crazy I've seen these employees deal with - they are great!! Sure, there can be a wait - but supply and demand - it's to be expected. All the pizzas we've gotten have been picture perfect. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Second time in and again I wait for a Ready Now plain ole cheese pizza!   I need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!"}
{"text":"I would just like to say I haven't even tried my Pizza yet. I am so disgusted by the unprofessionalism at this location. When I get off a 10 hr day at work and I just want to grab something quick the last thing I wanna hear is a bunch of children making my food. I mean really, the management really needs to revise their team.  People are cursing yelling in the back, one guy comes and talks to a customer complaining about their job....umm yah that's who I want making my food. I understand you pay for what you get, but even if you hate your job at least pretend to like it."}
{"text":"What's the point of calling ahead of time If they are still going to make you wait 20 minutes. The cooks are just walking around and screaming at each other. No organization what so ever!!! And I have to tell them not to give my pizza out because they can't read the receipts!!! I order lite sauce and they kept trying to give my pizzas away."}
{"text":"-Delightfully Surprised-  I've only eaten Little Caesars a few times in my life, and I hadn't had Little Caesars in 10+ years until a few days ago. I didn't have much cash on me and I was craving pizza, so I decided to stop in at this Little Caesars location. To my surprise, the pizza was great! I actually feel a bit foolish for not taking advantage of the \"Hot-N-Ready\" deal throughout my life.  This is your average pizza place, I'd put the quality slightly lower than Pizza Hut. You may sacrifice a little bit of quality, but the price is just too good to pass up. The food is pretty top notch and I would absolutely take it over an oven pizza from the grocery store. To describe the pizza; The crust is a bit thinner than the average pizza place, the toppings are plentiful, and the flavor is pretty dang good.  The ordering experience was fast and efficient. To grab a \"Hot-N-Ready\" pizza is as basic as walking in, exchanging $5 for your pizza, and walking out. I didn't spend much time talking with the employees, but they seemed polite and experienced with their jobs.  If you haven't had Little Caesars in a long time, I suggest that you give it another chance. I'm glad I did, and I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm craving pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was made great, but the young man on the register called me up then started a drawer count while the restaurant was full. For mgmt, he was not doing a cash drop.  He kept getting distracted and losing count to talk to his friend waiting with customers. When I paid, he counted my change then talked again to his friend, withholding it from me. Didn't offer a receipt either.  The pizza was made great! Bummer service."}
{"text":"I usually come her because it's close to home . But it's ridiculous how they have two registers and only 1 cashier. I waited in line for 20 min to pick up one box of pepperoni pizza. And it wasn't until I was already paying that the second cashier came from the back and said can I help who's next. Where were you when the two guys in front of me where already waiting for 25 plus minutes? I rather go a littler further and have faster and better customer service PLUS THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE !!"}
{"text":"Ready made pizzas is kinda of a stretch!  Never really been a massive ready made pizza kinda of person so maybe my view is altered a little. I just can't see how pizzas maybe sitting there are actually fresh and ready to go..  Any who, the few times I've been at this location I have found it to be packed, due to no pizzas ever being ready, it's a order and wait 20mins like every other fast food pizza place. Although the prices are cheaper than most, maybe heading over to the grocery store and grabbing a frozen pizza might be easier.  The layout is a simple counter with no seating inside or out, so if it is busy be prepared to stand a while.  Overall Service: 2-5 Food: 2-5 Drink: 3-5 (it's soda) Coming back: maybe if it isn't busy"}
{"text":"5 stars for the amazing customer service up front. I come here all the time and have never had a bad experience. Unfortunately, I'm waiting for my wings (totally fine with the wait) and all I hear from the back is an outrageous amount of profanity coming from a worker. I hear racial slurs and f-bombs being dropped every other word. I'm sorry, but that is extremely unprofessional. Unfortunately, it's not everyone else's fault that works here that she's such a bad worker. They at least tried to calm her, but she still went on for quite some time. I hope she gets some kind of punishment because at least two families had children present."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! We were told it would be a 10 minute wait for a CHEESE PIZZA and ended up waiting 30 minutes for it instead!! As they stack up pepperoni pizzas (while no one is waiting for them) and have a lobby full of unhappy customers!! The manager looks like she just crawled out of bed, and the staff is so slow they should work in a funeral home where people aren't waiting on them!! I really think this place has just lost my business!! Horrible!! They need to get some new employees, because the ones they have are completely incompetent... I hope this franchise owner has a pretty bank account for when these idiots run him out of business!! This service was SO BAD it's not an IF they close, it's a WHEN they close!! If I could have given NO STARS, I would have done that!!"}
{"text":"Definitely love the fact that I can get a super quick and non frozen large pepperoni pizza for $5 in less than 5 mins.  I am not going to attempt to compare Little Caesars to other pizza joint because that's not what they do.  To me they are the fast food version for pizza instead of custom make pizza joint. I haven't had a bad experience as far as customer service goes, but then again, I never order anything else but the Hot-N-Ready."}
{"text":"This by far has been the worst costumer service I have ever received.   Let me just start off by saying that I recently had twins so on this day at this particular hour and it happened to be that they fell asleep. I had called the store and I was parked outside and I asked one of the ladies if I gave them exact cash which I had if they could bring me the pizza.   The lady on the phone told me it was against their policy she said there was a mobile app that I could order from there. I asked her that if I order from the app since I parked right outside their doors if she could bring it to my car she said it was against their policy she can't leave the store with merchandise. So then I said OK will can you meet me at the door because I don't want to leave my kids in the car because they're asleep and their 10-month-old. She said and I quote \"ma'am I can't bring any merchandise outside but you are more than welcome to come inside and I can help you carry them out.\"  Hmmmmm   Soooo let me get this right! You want me to unload sleeping twins to walk inside with their car seats and you'll help me carry the pizza out? But!  I can't sit in my car and let my infants sleep and you bring it out???  Wow!!!   It's against your policy to carry out pizza but! You can \"help\" me carry it out?   No thank you! All I wanted was 1 ready to go pizza! So across the street I went and the NICE gentleman at PAPA JOHNS brought it out to me.   So much for customer service"}
{"text":"ok so this is the BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN ALL OF VEGAS!  Plus the ICB, or Italian Cheese Bread is the CHEESIEST CHEESY BREAD IN ALL OF VEGAS with a kick, some amazing spices on it  The rest is just your average pizza,  I could use a lil extra cheese on their normal pizza, I prefer extra cheesy than more saucy..  but the pizzas are fresh and fast and CHEAP!  Plus good taste is a good thing and they have amazing taste :)    The staff at this location are the BEST as well - love them :)  Thanks guys,  Lee"}
{"text":"Looks super ghetto but is actually really good pizza i've been here A lot this summer Little Caesars is without a doubt the best deal for pizza no where can you get A large pizza freshly made by hand for only five dollars can't wait to come back A lot more"}
{"text":"Called in an order of six pizzas on a Friday night. Went to go pick them up and the kid behind the counter said he was too busy and he gave our pizzas away and it would be a 40 minute wait. What good is it to call in and order an pizza for a pick up order. We were not late picking it up either. How rude is that! Guess dominoes is getting our business from now on!!"}
{"text":"I know this is just little caesars pizza, but the whole Hot-N-Ready lunch combo is pretty nonexistent here. I felt obliged to write a review as I am sitting here for the at least 10th time waiting for a lunch combo...average wait time 9 mins... 100% never Hot-N-Ready. All the employees look annoyed and messy..pizza is my favorite food and I love the deep dish, but honestly might have to stop coming here..its plain ridiculous."}
{"text":"We love little Caesars but the last 2 times we have been to this location our pizza wasn't cooked all the way through, it looked good but when we bit into it it was doughy and still cold. This is an unpleasant experience especially when you just get off work and you are hungry, expecting to eat a hot yummy pizza and it's cold and doughy."}
{"text":"I go to Little Caesar's mainly for the Hot-N-Ready pizzas. Something fast and quick, like I've gotten at numerous other chain locations. At this location however, there is no Hot-N-Ready. I came in quarter to 5 on a Friday, what one employee said was their \"rush hour.\" Being that it's regularly a busy time, I'd assume that they would have the Hot-N-Ready readily stocked and overly prepared. Instead of being in and out like I typically am, I waited around for 15 minutes. This establishment needs to get organized.  If you come to this location, just be prepared to be there for 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Walked in for a couple of \"hot and ready\" pizzas for a quick dinner tonight but actually had to wait over 15 minutes just for a cheese pizza. The pepperoni was ready and in the hot box, bet that's going to be delicious."}
{"text":"Called in 30 min before driving to pick it up and I come to find out they never put my order in? What? If I could put a negative star I would...! Hahaha idk why I even stayed this is why this place has 2 stars  Little Caesar's Pizza sucks don't buy. Customer service doesn't exist here. When I called she's like \"what do you want!\" Like rude! Like I know you hate your job but just do you job?"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza the previous day to ensure that they would be ready by 11:40. I was ordering 8 pizza's for a group of 5th graders. Since they have a set lunch time it was VERY IMPORTANT that they were on time. Nope!! They hadn't even started the dough for them. 25 minutes later I got the pizza. Wrong order but pizza. Why order early if they don't honor it. Won't be back. Get your act together people."}
{"text":"Placed an order for pic up at 5:20pm they said 20 mins. 6:10pm  im waiting for my order. Loud and unprofessional staff, joking, laughing and talking about other staff. I will pay for Pizza Hut next time"}
{"text":"Opened in 2014, this is fast and friendly location. This fast pizza chain is second on my list to Marcos. Quality is consistant and good.  The $5 hot and ready deal is incredible and if you're feeling like a Rockefeller you can get the $8 deep dish which is amazing."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, hot, fresh and cheap pizza. I like this location and wish there was a picnic area close by to eat my pizza. Otherwise we tend to stay in the parking lot which is less than desirable. Not many little ceasers around so some people drive a bit to get here."}
{"text":"Convenient out of the way location off Vodden near the 410. I love to come here as there is plenty of parking, it's never crowded, the service and pizza is good. I have been frequenting this location for a few years so I can say it's consistent. The cool thing is that there is a Foodland next door so you can pop in and grab some stuff to go with your Pizza as well."}
{"text":"Yes, I bribe my students with pizza parties. It effectively motivates them to work hard. This pizza is cheap and the students always gobble it up. I personally don't eat it, but I'm a pizza snob. Thanks for making a cheap pizza that kids love!"}
{"text":"The pizza is cheap and they are normally fast here. They have good customer service and the place is clean. It's also in a good location."}
{"text":"It's a hit or a miss - you might get an extra cheesy pizza or crazy bread that hasn't been fully cooked... seriously, this has happened to me more than once and when I complained, the employees didn't care. At all.   But the pizza is so cheap, you can spend $10 and have leftovers for the next few days."}
{"text":"These employees are working super hard and are usually understaffed. Saturday night, line out the door, one cashier, one pizza maker, and one person on ovens. Jose, with the blond highlights, was really helpful in correcting MY mistake. Thanks and keep up the good work! I like the online ordering with the Pizza Portal QR code pickup."}
{"text":"This hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  The pepperoni is clustered around the center.  The sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  The crazy bread is tasty though."}
{"text":"You have to wait forever, I even called my in.  I waited about a an hour and then decided to cancel my order.  Went to another location and called it in on my way and it was ready when I got there ( one off of Lone Mountain)."}
{"text":"I usually buy my kids a cheese pizza and crazy bread on Fridays. This location is a joke! The first time i went there they had a lady who couldn't even run the register. There were no hot and ready pizzas, I waited 20-25 mins. Normally I go to a different location but this was on the way. I tried going two more times, tonight being the last time. I didn't order from there because the person in front of me wanted the same thing I did, 1 cheese & 1 crazy bread. The guy said it would be a 15-20 min wait. I walked out, went to the one on Silverado ranch and was in and out in 1 minute. Last time I even attempt to step foot in that location."}
{"text":"I looked online to see what time they close and it said 11, I even called the location and asked if they still had what I asked for. Yet to find out, I drove all the way to the little Cesar's and it closes at 10. Wasn't very happy about that."}
{"text":"So I stopped here cuz I work nearby to get some dinner.   I think I came at a really good time. I ordered and got my food and immediately. Not only that but the pizza was hot and fresh as well as the crazy bread. And the crazy bread was actually big. I didn't think Little Caesars made crazy bread like this anymore. The Little Caesars by my house the crazy bread is as thin as your pinky finger. And as hard as a cracker. And as dry as a bone, and the pizza never ready."}
{"text":"ya know, the kids working here are ALWAYS nice. you can tell they are hurrying. They are polite to everyone. The pizza is hot- BUT i wish they would put some more muscle into cutting it, I dont think we have ever received a pizza that completely cut through.   I would also like to suggest that on busy nights- like Friday and Saturday when the line is literally out the door, how about stuffing the oven with pizzas instead of the person 5 ahead in line orders 2, so they put 2 in, the next person orders 3 so they call for 3 to put in... They aren't \"hot and ready\" if you arent filling the order til it comes in... If you're packed, just keep sticking them in. CLEARLY you're going to sell them. ;)"}
{"text":"I came in for a Hot-N-Ready pizza of which there is only 1 Pretzel actually ready. Currently about 6 customers waiting. I see 1 staff member taking orders, 1 making food & 3 out here with customers, cooing over someone's baby. Based on the \"Hot-N-Ready my a$$!\" comment from the customer next to me, they're waiting on the same thing I am. I REALLLLY don't see myself coming back. One Yelp reviewer said this is the best L.C. in Vegas. I say \"Be afraid folks. Be very afraid.\""}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered two stuffed crust pizzas. I quickly dropped the pizzas off at the house before heading to work only to find out that the pizzas they gave me were not stuffed crust. I called the store and spoke with Fabian the manager, he insisted that I bring in the receipt and the pizzas. I explained to him that the cashier did not give me a receipt and also that I was at work and unable to bring the pizzas in. He was confrontational and would not remedy the situation. I filed a complaint with the corporate office and will not return.  Update: Received an email from the corporate office stating they would investigate the incident. 3 weeks later, still no response. I replied to the email and didn't get a response there either. What's the point of emailing me to let me know you will investigate and resolve if you do not plan on following up?"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero star if there was a way to do so.  I call in an order to pick up. When I get in there with my 51/2 and 4 year old there are two people ahead of me, so we wait. With just two people left, the lady at the counter is confused who she needs to service 1st.   So to the kind lady who thought 'that was rude' when I said I called in an order, I need my pizza so I can get outta here. The reason I called in an order, so I don't have to wait. And your confusion doesn't help.  Never going back here."}
{"text":"Can't beat $5 a pizza.. & it's always hot & ready  I always come here and will continue too. Even with the construction in the way."}
{"text":"Will never go there any more. Cheap but disgusting. They donnno how to bake it!!! It is tricky if you look at the eds/pictures but unfortunately..."}
{"text":"$5 carry-out special? How can you deny it? awesome!   Sure the pizza is mediocre at best, but for five bucks, you can have lunch with dinner-leftovers, or even stretch it out to make three meals with it. And it's always ready as soon as you step foot into the place.  Kinda gross? yes. Kinda tasty? yes. plus cheap and fast, works for me when i need it to."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but nothing at this location is ever \"hot and ready\" like their slogan. No matter what time of day, you always have to wait for at least 10 minutes. Guess that's what you get when you pick the cheapest option."}
{"text":"I stopped in this Little Caesars because I had a very trying day at work and wasn't in the mood  to cook. They were very friendly and attentive  as soon as I entered the facility.   My order was perfect. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered through the phone for a half Hawaiian and half pepperoni. They told us it would be 15 minutes, we went about 30 min later and they still didn't have our order ready. When we finally got our order they gave us a Deep Dish Double  Stuffed Pizza... When we told the cashier that this was not our order, they kept insisting that it was and didn't even charge us. I immediately assumed this was someone else's. I don't mind free pizza, but I would prefer to also have my original order, due to some pepperoni hatters in my household and i don't like cheese all that much so this pizza was completely pointless. Me going home with Deep Dish and only pepperoni... nah. So we claimed that we would wait and pay. She kept insisting that I was wrong and this was my order.. I haven't even payed yet, but she claimed that I did. So i ended up leaving with Deep Dish double stuffed. And upset i couldn't even place an order for my original intended pizza."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I've been to this little Caesars at warm springs and Durango, I've gotten an extra most bestest and a pepperoni deep dish. All 3 times all pizzas have had hardly any cheese on them. And when I say hardly, I mean, you can literally see the pizza dough between the pepperonis because there's almost no cheese. Super frustrating considering it's supposed to be the \"extra most bestest\" and the advertisements show tons of cheese. Yes I know it's only $6 but you should give what you advertise."}
{"text":"This is a new location and unfortunately they're not as diligent in service or quality of food as they were when they first opened. They opened this store a few months back. The service was prompt, friendly,  and professional.  The pizza was hot, fresh, cheesy, and tasty. As of recently,  it seems the honeymoon is definitely over. The last 3 visits here I have had to wait for someone to come to the register, even though you can see the employees in the kitchen standing around socializing,  or better yet, when they finally do come to the register, they're still goofing around with each other. The pizza has been dry, hardly no cheese, and pretty sad looking.  I know it's Little Caesar's,  but my kids love the stuff, and actually I have enjoyed it too. Unfortunately,  the last few visits at this spot is kind of ruining their chances of us coming back. Hopefully,  they get back their quality of service they so consistently displayed when they first opened. Crossing fingers..."}
{"text":"I love Little Caesars, I come here all the time. However yesterday was different. If Satan had swamp ass it would be at this location. It was so hot and humid I couldn't breathe inside the place, I honestly feel bad for its employees. With these working conditions in mind, I do believe someone's bodily fluids got onto my pizza because I was extremely sick. I actually thought I had Toxic Shock Syndrome because I was feeling like death. I would only come here in the winter when it's employees aren't baking alive along side the pizza their making."}
{"text":"The best customer service in this chain. Manager actually cares about his customers. Pizzas are always hot and fresh. Best Little Caesars location around. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hungry? Want something cheap? Want something that is actually a decent to eat? Want something fast?  How fast?  Like how about you walk in ask for it..get it in seconds piping hot...pay for it...and leave...fast...$5 dollar Hot and Ready Medium Pepperoni Pizza..Little Caesars has your back!!    One of my favorite quick dinner/lunch spots.  You can't beat the price tag of $5 dollars.  The pizza is decent...good taste..and enough toppings.  You get your choice of either cheese or pepperoni.  They also do make hot and ready pizzas in with other toppings ranging from a meat lovers to a veggie, but alas with added toppings come added cost ($3-$4 premium).  I have noticed that the price does differ from location to location ($5 to $5.55), which I would hazard a guess that each one is franchise owned.  Little Caesars does offer the regular pizza fare, but they also offer chicken wings and its new deep dish style pizza (which both are available as hot and ready as well) and don't forget the Crazy Bread which is pizza dough rolled into sticks and slathered with butter and garlic!  I walked into this location and there was a customer who ordered 100 hot and ready pizzas for a party..just to see that amount was crazy..Great value for the money and it actually tastes good!!   4 stars!!"}
{"text":"There are a few things that make a lot more sense when you're wasted: Slim Jims, Steven Seagal movies, the validity of your town's football team as opposed to a neighboring town's football team. Add Little Caesar's to the list. I'm not drinkin' the Hate-O-Rade or anything; you just know where it's at."}
{"text":"No gloves on food handlers preparing pizzas and touching their cell phone . Department of Health needs to re inspect this Grade A certificate."}
{"text":"I am appalled at the service I experienced here.  First of all, there are never any \"hot and ready\" pizzas that are actually ready, the employees are very rude and impersonal, and there is absolutely no management present to handle as much volume that comes in and out of there.  I ordered a couple of pizzas that I was told would take ten minutes.  I came back in ten minutes and watched as about thirty people came in and out before I finally got up to see where my order was and it was in the heat lamp, yet no one said a word to me about it being ready, nor did I get an apology from the girl who rang me up but watched me sit there staring at her for over a half  an hour.  I literally wasted about 40 minutes of my time due to incompetent employees and I will never return."}
{"text":"This little pizza place can not be expected to be something amazing.  But they are, actually, pretty good. Their pizzas are very basic but tasty.  I do buy from them very often.  It's really convenient that they usually have the pepperoni option ready to go.  It is run mostly by young kids.  They are friendly, but sometimes a little messy and less attentive to the customers walking through the door."}
{"text":"Cheap, cardboard pizza.  Back in the day when this plaza had Benny Shapiros, Baskin Robins and Peaches it probably would of been shut down quick.  Those were some heavy hitters back in the day.  Crazy bread is still good but not like in the 80's and 90's.  There is still the porn store across the street so you can make it a double-banger if that's how you roll.  Got kicked out of here once for indecent exposure, but I quit that.  All good now..."}
{"text":"horrible service & takes a long time!!!!! they gave me hard crazy bread and i asked for another one and took 20 minutes and they were still burnt !!!!! ugh!!!!! worst service"}
{"text":"They never have anything ready. I can understand once in awhile them not having something ready , the issue is they never have it ready. In the last year not once ready. The slogan needs to be changed to hot and Never ready!"}
{"text":"the pizza was hot and ready, but wasn't as fresh as papa John. The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"HNR Pepperoni pizza.  Although I don't feel this is the best pizza, for $5.00 ya get what you pay for.  Quick, hot, and convenient meal for at least two adults.   It's not the Little Ceasars Pizza that I grew up with, but in a pinch it's a good go to. Location is easily accessible,  staff is polite and knowledgeable,  transaction simple and quick. Two (2) stars for pizza quality + four (4) stars for location and staff rounds it out to three (3) stars."}
{"text":"Worst little Cesar's I have ever been to the staff is rude and have no idea what they are doing!! Hot and ready in 20 mins always I have came to this location at least 10 times and I always wait! I blame the ownership train these kids you have working on how to put out some product! Personally I believe it you advertise hot and ready and is not its free, maybe then you would plan and prep for the day!"}
{"text":"I get to little Caesars i tell them what i want i got a large pepperoni and a pretzel pizza on the signs it says hot and ready between  4 and 8. They didnt have any ready, they said 8 minutes okay 15 minutes later then its finally ready. Dont advertise if your not gonna have it"}
{"text":"I know it's little caesars but we go there for pizza movie night with the kids. This girl made me tell her five times I wanted a pizza like she didn't want me to get a pizza. I paid for a pizza I'm not going back for cause when I spoke to the manager she didn't seem to understand what I was saying. So I don't think I will go there anymore."}
{"text":"The newest manager handled things as well as could be done given all the mistakes that were created by them.   They stay open the latest in town.  They are close enough to I485 and I77  They will answer the phone.    Close to Food Lion, the video store, a hair store is in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Look, eat it while it's hot.   The cheese bread is what I love.  The price is what the kid loves. Folks will say, \"we don't eat that cheap stuff\" but have a lot a kids or a campus meeting and this is it - especially if your org doesn't reimburse like they should.   No delivery.   Service at this location hasn't failed us once.   The parking lot is akin to most \"urban\" areas. What do I mean...just hood for no reason."}
{"text":"unfortunately our experience has been a little more than awful. We went in hungry just like everyone else, but when my wife and I arrived home- we couldn't eat. The dough wasn't baked on more than half of the pizza. It's a shame because we do enjoy Little Caesar's pizza, but as far as this location we will not be returning and it was an extreme disappointment."}
{"text":"First time here. Went in at lunchtime 12:50. Not \"Ready\". Was told it was a 10 minute wait.  I wouldn't have tried to get \"Hot and Ready\" pizza if I had 10 minutes to wait."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service I have ever had at a fast food place. Didn't think you could give this bad a service. I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Ya'll already know how I feel about Lil Ceas."}
{"text":"Never has pizza ready.... if you do get pizza it's guaranteed to be a 40 min wait. Staff has no urgency for customer service. Would love to find the number to corporate and inform them of the poor practices of this place."}
{"text":"Every time i go there's always plenty of hot and readys ready lol staff is always nice and sweet . Pizza always seems to be fresh . It's a $5 pizza what do you expect."}
{"text":"\"If we don't off you a crazy combo... ITS FREE!\" The gentleman in front of me ordered 1 pepperoni pizza and soda, the man behind the counter did NOT in fact offer the costumer \"crazy bread\" (easy mistake no blame there towards the man behind the counter) the costumer called him out on it and the guy behind the counter denied it claiming that he did in fact offer him it with both me and my girlfriend backing up the costumer that he did NOT offer him it.   They are famous for promoting how fast as well, we got 2 normal hot n ready pizzas and had enough time to nearly finish an episode of family guy on our phone before it was done, not to mention the guy who rang me up was extremely rude (probably because we were on the crazy bread guys side)"}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was neither hot nor ready.  Finally got my pizza 10 minutes later.  After arriving home, I was disappointed to find inside the box was a cheese pizza, despite the label being pepperoni.  When I return the pizza, all I got was an apology.  And, they even took back the cheese pizza."}
{"text":"This Caesars isn't that great when it comes to customer service.  Don't get me wrong though, the pizza is bomb! However, they need to fix the way they help out customers.  Every time I go in here or my boyfriend goes in, they are always either doing stuff in the back or at the front staring at the computer where they take orders.  I have to literally go up to their face to make sure they see me in order for them to finally notice that I am there waiting for my order to be taken.  The employees seem like they hate being there.  I can just see it in their faces and how they respond to you that they just do not care at all.  I'm sorry to say this, but every time I go in here it is only because it is convenient and the nearest Caesars to the house.  I feel the employees bad vibes, like it is a task for them to help me out, speak to me, and take my order.    One instant, I came in late night after coming back from class and the place was packed with people waiting.  You didn't even know where the line was or even if there was a line.  People were just waiting in the super small waiting area.  Again, I had to go up to the counter to make sure she saw me and she took my order.  She told me it would take 15 minutes so I believed her.  I stood next to another lady and I asked her how long she was waiting and she said 45 MINUTES! That is just not acceptable.  I was like wow, if she is still waiting for her order I am definitely going to be here for awhile (started regretting even getting pizza here in the first place).  So the lady next to me got her order and left, she was pretty mad at the employees since it really took a long time.    After that, I was still waiting, 30 minutes have gone by.  The girl who was working took out a new batch of pepperonis and put it in the oven.  She just started calling out numbers that were way after mine.  Long story short,  I had to go up to her and ask her if my 1 pepperoni pizza was ready and she just say oh yeah here it is (didn't even say thank you or sorry for the long wait). Like I ordered 1 pizza! and they were giving it out to the people who ordered after I ordered.  I don't know what system they have going on here, but it just needs to change.  I just come here to get my pizza as fast as I can possible. I don't even expect the staff to be nice or have manners towards me or other customers anymore."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I'm giving little Caesars 4 stars . The Stuff Crust Was DELICIOUS . Crazy bread not bad. Regular pizza typical 5 buck quality.  I can't complain.  I'm satisfied"}
{"text":"this place would get NO stars if I could because of their extremely poor service! there is ALWAYS A WAIT  for their \"HOT AND READY\" pizza I'm sick of it even when I call ahead I still wait, I'm done waiting I'm going elsewhere and i suggest you do too! their pizza sucxz anyways!"}
{"text":"Got the new pepperoni pizza with pretzel crust and cheese sauce! It was amazing, not to mention it was only $6, what a deal. The location even had it hot n ready, so I didn't have to wait around. Will be getting again."}
{"text":"Negatives:  It's 11am and they don't have any pizzas ready despite the fact that they advertise 'hot and ready'.  The counter person was a little impersonal and the wait for pizzas was longer than the 15 minutes they promised. Employee who was prepping and cooking did not have a hat or hair net. He also had a beard. Also did not wear gloves. :(   Positives:  Place does look clean and I like the exposed kitchen."}
{"text":"Always out of everything! Always out of hit and ready products and lunch items! Just go to another local location that has it together!"}
{"text":"I've tried pizzas all over Vegas, Henderson and a few places on the other side of this planet like Athens, Hong Kong, London and Paris. Gino's East in Chicago makes good deep dish but my current favorite is the Deep Dish made by Jacob at this Little Caesars. If you like their tomato sauce, try double or triple sauce. The LC location is not the closest to my home but they make it worth the extra few miles."}
{"text":"I walked in and was immediately alarmed by the long line ahead of me. The scene was chaotic and overwhelming. I approached the register to place a order of two large cheese and two large pepperoni pizzas. The cashier told me it would take approximately 10-15mins. I understood well and explained to them I would just be across the street at Vons and would return before then. I was gone no longer than 10 mins at the most. I returned to find a even longer line, and the two cashiers arguing. It was complete and utter chaos. This is what I observed while waiting for my order...  * A man walked in and stole someone else's pizza. * The two cashiers leaving the front of the store to go behind the counter and talk to other associates.  * The cashier accidentally dropping pizza after pizza while giving them to each customer.  * An associate who did not work that day came in to greet everyone. She walked behind the back counter and continued to talk to and distract all of the associates. * The manager was working with the associates behind the counter. He was very quiet and gave no direction or authority. I only figured he was the manager due to his uniform. (He should have been in front dealing with the upset customers rather than hiding in the back.)  * I was told an approximate 10-15 min wait. I ultimately waited 45 mins. I had to continue to repeat the cashier what my order was. Did I mention it was my birthday?   My overall experience was absolutely horrendous. I would never recommend going back to this site until the management is replaced. The associates were polite to me and reassured to me that my order was on its way. However, that does not excuse the work ethic or terrible customer service I observed with other unfortunate guests.   The pizza was hot and fresh as promised. It was not worth the 45 minute wait or struggle that I had to endure."}
{"text":"Not sure of the persons name that was manning the register around 10pm. But what an unprofessional d-bag, short Hispanic Indian looking guy. When he asks my girlfriend for her name, she says \"Chris\" (as in \"Christine\".) Asks her to repeat it again, and then he smirks and lightly laughs? Says it will be 10 a minute wait, we weren't in a hurry so it's fine, but what happened to hot and ready? We pay and wait. Decide we want to buy a liter of soda and I blatantly put it in front of the register. 3 minutes later another customer walks in and he runs up to ring up their order and I said, can I pay for this real quick? And he drew a blank stare and sighed. Finally when our order was ready, he tried giving our pizzas to another dude. I said, no wait, that's my order, for Chris. He still hesitated and said, wait no. You're not Chris, who's Chris? And he looked at the other dude again. I said, it's 3 pepperonis and 1 cheese man, give me my food. Drew a blank stare again and finally gave it to me."}
{"text":"Hot-N-Ready my rear end. This place NEVER EVER has pizza \"ready\" it's only \"hot\" because you have to wait for it EVERY SINGLE you come in here. Doesn't matter what time day. I don't think we have ever been in here and they actually had pizza ready. I personally dislike this pizza and have to drown it in sauces for it to be close to bearable so it's extremely frustrating to have to wait for it every time. STOP SAYING \"READY\" because it's a crock and false advertising!"}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza!    I spent time taking advantage of Little Caesars throughout my freshman year of college in Lynchburg, VA by never giving up my coupons and \"leaving them in my dorm\".  These days the pizza is so cheap you don't need to defraud!  It's pretty good and the value is amazing if you're looking for something fast to feed the friends or family!  Do it Do it!"}
{"text":"For what you pay for (value $5), and general speed of service, Little Caesars is a good option.  I went in on Saturday about 5pm and it was ready without ordering.  At times in the past I've had to wait 5 minutes tops.  I generally get one for for the kids, at times I'll indulge too.  Average tasting, some better, some worse."}
{"text":"THE WORST little Caesar's pizza. Crazy bread was overdone and not the same, pizza was wrong I ordered cheesy bread crust or whatever I didnt get that and saw I was charged for it. Took forever to get my order even when I called an hour ahead. I'm so disappointed"}
{"text":"Prepare for a long wait. My food was warm when I got it. I can see why oeople call in advance, but hey you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Always have to wait...the drive-they gets super busy but it always seems to take way too long. I even called ahead of time for 5 pizzas and they were not even done.  They acted as if they knew nothing about it after the guy on the phone told me he would get started on the order."}
{"text":"Came in 1 week ago, staff was friendly and lively. This week manager complaining about being tired and wanting to smoke. Not even remotely friendly. Think we woke them up."}
{"text":"I called ahead for my order this time. It was ready when I got there, hot and freshly made. Good pizza for the price."}
{"text":"Only perk about this location is the cheap prices. You can get six dollar large Cheese or pepperoni pizzas. Great deal if you're trying to get pizza on a budget or for a large group.   Unfortunately the \" Hot n ready\" Pizza as advertised is never hot and ready.   So if you want a mediocre pizza they are going to wait 20+ minutes for with unfriendly service to go along with it , I would highly recommend going to this location.   I haven't been to another little Caesars for a while so I can't get feedback on other locations but if there anything like this one it's worth paying A little extra to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It was late at night and most pizza places were closed at that time to satisfy the craving. A large Pepperoni is about $6 and it comes warm and flat-tasting but with that price why expect much?   The girl behind the register seemed so miserable and that made me smile and reminded me how great my day was. Some frozen oven-baked pizzas from the grocery store taste better."}
{"text":"This location is the best little caesars I've been to. The pizza is always hot and ready. The cashier is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"$5 for a large pepperoni. That's cheaper than some frozen pizza.   For the price, it's not bad. Sometimes I'll call ahead and order a custom pizza. They always come out better. I guess because it will be right from the oven instead of the warmer.   Always check your pizza. One time they forgot to cut mine."}
{"text":"Only thing I had a problem with are employees who are clearly not on the clock and are present in the store distracting other workers.  One even said \" sorry I'm off the clock\"  I Appreciate Cody J for helping me today. He was cashiering and multitasking while others just stood around talking."}
{"text":"I give this place a chance avout 3 times a year. They never have any Hot N Ready pizzas, it's always a 20 to 30 minute wait, and today I watched the cashier go from handling cash to prepping breasticks with no gloves on or washing of his hands. Staff is also always unfriendly. I have no idea how they pass their health inspections."}
{"text":"I've come back to Little Caesars Pizza a few times since my last review. I'm not ashamed to admit that I slum it once in a while. The pizza is still way below average, but the $5 dollar price tag draws me in. During each visit, they actually had a cheese ready, and the guy at the counter actually appeared to know what he was doing.  I really don't recommend this place unless you're looking to get some pizza, but want to save some cash."}
{"text":"Called to phone order pizza since we are order more than one. (We order 4) Rachel was so rude over the phone. I was rushed to order because she was short staffed. Which I am not sure why that's my fault. We order at 11:25 am and was told it would be 30 min. We got there at 11:55am and still didn't get our pizza till 12:10 That's unacceptable. We order alot of pizza for our company and we will no longer be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Never been a big fan but recently discovered the 'deep deep' pizzas for $8 & man they're pretty good! Taste just like a Sicilian & warm up Nicely for leftovers - Esp for $8 & Esp since you can order online & help yourself when you arrive for pick up - great system - love it!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. I was surprised to be honest, but the wait was really long and the young gal managed the busy store like a pro. Not the best area, but since the food is takeout, it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Just came in and of course nothing is \"hot and ready\" . The only thing was a pepperoni pizza and cheese bread so I get that. The pizza and cheesy bread were so stiff and and hard it looked like they had been cooked hours ago. It was dry and semi warm. My boyfriend cut the inside of his mouth due to the crust on the cheesy bread which tasted completely off. On top of that I never received a receipt. I've never had one good experience here. I usually call and give them at least 40 minutes to get my food ready but I didn't have the time today. I really need to find a different location. Even tho this one is the closest I will drive the extra miles for a decent meal."}
{"text":"This location dont even deserve a 1 star rating.. but i gotta press it in order to post this. These employees might be getting payed less and their pace on getting these damn pizzas done really show it. To place an order, I had to talk to 3 different people to tell me \"yes we can order for you hold on..\" \"can you call back in 5 min\" etc.. management gotta be on their people and go out and have a job fair or some shit lol or at least have a better customer service. geez"}
{"text":"Always packed with a slow moving line. Pizza is, what it is, but I do love the sweet tomato sauce better than Pizza Huts'! Managers cannot control the staff in the back from missing an order when its busy and when they do- its always mine. Managers will offer a you a 2 liter soda or bread sticks if your pizzas forgotten but you usually hv it already ordered in the first place. Dec want to get in before the crowd or you will be waiting all night!!!"}
{"text":"Dude time and again this little ceasars messes up everyone's order, taking 30 mins for a \"hot and ready pizza\" and they can't even cut a pizza to save their life, I won't be back this place is garbage the manager needs a new staff in fact they need all new staff period."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly.  Much better than two weeks ago. Checked pizza before I left and my child's response once home was \"this is some damn good pizza!!\"  Thanks"}
{"text":"Gave this place another chance and still crappy service as before. ON-LINE Service is useless but to deceive Little Caesar's Pizza's customers.  We placed an order  a little after 5pm and waited for over an hour to get 3 pizzas. I had to drive to the establishment to find out why my 19 year old still didn't have his pizzas? He had his bread sticks but no pizza so I had to return their cold product! The pizzas that were in the warmers were for previous customers that had placed orders that had been waiting longer than an hour since we had been waiting there longer... This establishment lies like Pinocchio, in your face!  May the owner of this place show his face or at least list his number or email so we can tell you why we would never send family or friends to this pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick and fast meal after a long day at work. The hot n ready pizzas are the way to go.. this was the first time at this location. It was a Friday night and they were so busy the line was out the door. They were very quick and pleasant. I dont think I was in line for more than five minutes. Three pizzas and 3 orders of breadsticks only cost me $27. You can't beat that and I don't have to do dishes. Win win lol. The worst part of my experience wasn't the employees or the food it was a customer being so mean, rude and yelling at the employees because his pizza wasn't ready fast enough. It's Friday night. Everyone is tired from work. We all have been there, but a kind heart and patience goes a long way."}
{"text":"We were going to be spending our entire day swimming so we decided to stop and pick up a few hot n ready pizzas, breadsticks and drinks so we wouldn't have to leave the pool. The restaurant was clean and in a nice shopping center with a large fry's grocery store. The boy at the counter seemed impatient from the start. I started to order the pizza and right away he told me the price. He didn't even make sure I was done ordering, didn't ask if I needed anything else, I had to tell him twice the sauce I wasn't because he picked the wrong one. I ordered a few orders of breadsticks, and again seemed a bit irritated and told me there was only one bag and made it out like it would take way to long to make more. I'd have to wait five extra minutes. By this time I was irritated and just said give me the two pizzas, and one bag of breadsticks with our drinks. I paid and left. We got back to the pool and instantly our disappointment grew big time. One bite into the pizza and we were all turned off. It was hard like cardboard. It tasted like it had been sitting for days and over cooked.  Yes I know it's a hot n ready, and it sits in a warmer. We usually go to a location in Marley Park. It never taste like that. I will definitely not be back to this location."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to me. I must say, I continue to buy from this pace, because is convenient location and my kids like this pizza. They never have cheese pizza ready, I'm talking  about, at least 5 times already. If they advertise \"hot and ready\" why are they not ready! I truly don't understand.  Don't they know they sell cheese pizza? Why are they met ready? At least a 10 minute wait every time"}
{"text":"I always walk in and walk out 30 mins later, oh well friendly staff good $5 Large Pizza. I especially like their new deep deep dish worth the $10, haven't tried anything else yet."}
{"text":"Gave this a couple of tries. Every time I have been here, service was slow and the hot and ready pizzas were hardly hot, minimal amount of pepperoni, and barely even cooked thoroughly. I even asked if they had any other fresh ones or to even put what I bought back in the oven to cook it a bit more but I get shrugged off with an attitude.  The first few times I thought maybe it was just an off day and gave it a few more tries because it was the closest one to me but this Little Caesar's location was consistently off.  Unless things improve, I'll no longer go to this location."}
{"text":"Worst one in AMERICA. A: I ordered my order over the phone and they said it would be 10 minutes.  B: when I arrived they said they didn't carry what I had. It took me 5 minutes to figure out what was doing on and they still were confused. The woman with glasses in her 30-40 kept saying they didn't carry what I called in. However she was the only female working. After asking the one other employee he said yes they do carry the wing sauce I wanted and just had to walk out. I went to Papa Johns. They get shit right."}
{"text":"When your craving a pizza but don't want to wait an hour to get one, Little Ceaser's is the place to go. Hot and fresh every time.   Consistently cooked the same way every time. I love the Jalapeño Cheesy dipping sauce too."}
{"text":"Soooo.... I ordered pizza and breadsticks from here and waited and waited... When I took the pizza and crazy bread home, everything was burnt. That plus they didn't give me all of my order. This place used to have good service but today it is an utter failure. Not even an apology when I came back to return my burnt food and get the rest of my order. Don't go to this location! Even the locations in rough neighborhoods have better service"}
{"text":"NEVER HAVE HOT AND READY, Ready...so frustrating time after time. They really need to ensure they have the products ready....I've walked out 3 times during the 4-8 time frame because they have nothing ready"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because it's hot fresh pizza that costs 5 bucks! Stop and think: At QT a single slice of pepperoni pizza costs 2 dollars. With Little Ceasars you get a whole pie for just a few bucks more. Is it gourmet pizza? I course not. I'd say it's a couple of steps above high school cafeteria pizza. But if you're looking for cheap food and its several days before payday, you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"Visited This LC yesterday and everything on my order was fine but while I was waiting there were about six  teenage employees in the back laughing like a bunch of fools, nothing about the place felt like a restaurant, more like an arcade, very  inappropriate and unprofessional! I'm more upset about how this elderly man was treated from the kid at the register no service no hello no goodbye no hospitality.  he  was trying use a gift card or something and it wasn't working but the employee didn't even care about helping at allI, I know good hospitality and this was super below average! I  don't think they had manager that day. This place should be closed down"}
{"text":"730 on a Sunday night, nothing hot and ready. Had to place an order when I got there and wait. I only stopped here because I wanted something quick, grab and go.  There were people waiting before me, and several people that came in after me while I was waiting. Everyone had to wait. One woman even said she placed her order in advance of coming and was there to pick it up, they didn't even start it!!  She waited like everyone else. There was only one guy working the front registers and had to keep asking people what did they order. Their didn't seem to be any form of organization or order recording to ensure the correct order requests were being.made. They made my pizza but forgot the crazy bread, since nothing was being made in advance as \"hot and ready\" I had to continuing waiting while they made the crazy bread. I also observed some health code violations. I watched as the 3 men in the kitchen area were making food but doing other things in between and not washing their hands or wearing gloves before going back to the food prep.  One who appeared to be a manger was making pizzas, then did some sweeping with the broom, and went right back to making pizzas with his bare hands without washing his hands. Another guy who was preparing food would stop to take phone orders and enter them on the computer went right back to preparing food with his bare hands no hand washing and he did this several times. I feel like they were rushing the food orders and not cooking all the way. The pizza and crazy bread seemed a bit doughy and not cooked as much as it should have been, likely due to rushing and just trying to get orders out.  I likely won't visit this location again.  I might as well order from a better quality pizza place if I'm going to have to wait anyways. And based on many others reviews, this never having any \"hot and ready\" pizzas appears to be an ongoing issue.  Clearly a very poorly run location."}
{"text":"The prices are really good, the staff Is fast and friendly, I never have to wait for my order and the pizza is the best in town. Only thing is that the boys behind the counter can be immature and I saw an older dude in the kitchen loading more pizza sauce up while smoking a cigar, not too clean but great otherwise."}
{"text":"So the girl behind the counter is the acting Supervisor due to others being ill. It was 2:09pm. I asked the girl if she'd allow me the $5 lunch thing. She said \"no, I cant\".  Um...if you're the acting supervisor and the highest ranking person there, you are the one who can make decisions.  She didn't pick that I was seriously a little mad that I am 9 minutes past & she still wouldn't do it. Told her (& yes, I'm aware it was rude of me to say) to not try moving up to management as you can't make this simple exception. Told her she just lost a loyal customer due yo her lack of working with me. So...cause I'm hungry & now have to figure out what I'm in the mood for next.....annoyed!"}
{"text":"Giving this store high marks as the service has improved tremendously.  They appear to have gotten rid of Lindsay who used to verbally attack customers, so I stopped coming for a year.  But she seems to not br arround anymore so have slowly started getting my junk foid here again everyday.  I often feel sick to my stomach after eating here but that is what junk food does and I should not blame the store. Only thing that SUCKS is you gotta pay for sauce unlike their competitor down the street which provides for free any dipping sauce you want.  So removing one star for that BS."}
{"text":"If I could get give this location zero stars I would!!!! They NEVER have hot and readys!!! It takes over 30 mins to get a dang pizza and it's not rush hour time it's ANYTIME not to mention the lazy people they hire to work there!!! Smh  Never have pizza Dirty Lazy people  I HATE this location!!!"}
{"text":"Holy frozen pizzas Batman! I got a coupon in the mail for a $5.00 pizza! Awesome! What a deal! So I called to order and the guy on the phone was confused. \"Just come pick it up.\" Strange, usually I have to order a pizza before I go get it. But not here because they only have two choices: cheese and pepperoni. Except when I went they didn't have cheese so I had to have pepperoni. It was kinda cold, the crust obviously came out frozen from a box before being topped with the crappiest, greasiest cheese ever. But for 5 bucks, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"DH Loves LC.....This location is usually busy. Call ahead. The Pizza is as expected from LC. Tried a Hot & Ready and also a  ExtraMostBestest Pizza. Worth a $1 more???  Yes, what's $6 for a pizza."}
{"text":"Just went to this location around 9:30 after I got off work. I ordered a hot and ready cheese, pepperoni, and a crazy combo. They were out of cheese so it was going to be a short wait which is fine. However there was a young man working that got mad that a pizza had to be made after he just mopped the floors. I get that you want to get home and stuff and are frustrated that food has to be made and there might be a small mess. I also work in the food industry and at least I have the common sense to keep quiet around customers."}
{"text":"Usually good for picking up some quick pizzas on short notice, however there is ALWAYS a wait for the cheese pizzas. All the employees look like they are in middle school, and always have an I don't care attitude, but whatever. It's a $5 pizza place. Good for quick food.... Most of the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday at 6:30pm, place was busy, no parking available with several people standing inside, apparently waiting for orders...?  I asked at the counter if they had any pizzas besides $5 pizzas, and I was told, rather curtly, by the 16 year old girl at the register that all they have for sale are $5 pizzas.  I asked if I could order and wait for a deep dish or the $6 extra extra, and was told \"no, we too busy to make anything except $5 pizzas\". Meanwhile, while I was trying to order and engage the young girl at the register, the manager/shift leader started talking to her about a previous customer, and literally was talking over me while I was trying to order.  The place was CHAOTIC...no way to run a business, and offering only ONE menu item...?  Never again, the Glendale location was just as poorly run.  From now on its going to be Dominos or Hungry Howies pizza."}
{"text":"Day two of my wife, child, mother , and myself in constant rotation in the restroom after eating the new half and half deep dish pizza. I've never had food poisoning before so I gave them a star for showing me a new experience. This isn't the first encounter I've had with this place but definitely the last. The first was a smokehouse pizza that I quickly discovered had been rewarmed , probably stashed in the back by one of the employees who didn't want to dirty anything considering it was late. It was like chewing on cardboard. But looking at my daughter say \"tummy tummy\" is enough for me to never go there again."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location, I experience bad customer service and gross crazy bread. The rainbow and tropicana location knew how to make crazy bread, but this location's bread is always dry and slightly burned. Will definitely not be going here any longer."}
{"text":"We grab take out from this location about once every 3 months for the convenience and hot and ready deal for $5. Although majority of the time that we do come they have no hot and readys available so we have to wait. Isnt it called \"Hot and Ready\" for a reason! Maybe they should re name it \"Hot and Wait\" hahaha."}
{"text":"Omg i would never complain about 5 dollar pizza but when it's twice that u order in n you get there n wait 15 min line being next mind u not , just to be told that your order was never put in n I have to wait again for it to be made that's a little too much"}
{"text":"Been here twice.. the first time sucks but it was rush hour.. 2nd time was great.. cheap pizza"}
{"text":"Pretty sure  if you've been to one little Caesars pizza you been to the mall I have no complaints about this store every time I order I'm in and out quick. They always have my hot and ready pizzas ready so I'm a happy guy lo"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awful. After 5 years of ordering customs pizzas and having every single order screwed up some way or another, I'm done going here."}
{"text":"This place is horribly ran! Always slow and unorganized. Worker walked in with a cigarette talking about her personal issues. They never have hot and ready pizzas ready. The cashier always asks us to order our stuff crust on the mobile app and still it will be 30-40 minutes. Update: called to file a complaint and was promptly hung up on."}
{"text":"Little Ceasars has gone back to a simple menu and kept prices down. Really good place for a quick $5 pizza. Staff seemed overwhelmed, but very friendly. Do note, this is to-go only, no delivery or dining room. Would definitely stop here again"}
{"text":"Pretty standard little Caesars. Not lower quality than the other ones. The floor inside isn't the clearnest little Caesars floor I've been on top of. The cheese pizza is a cheap way to go in terms of feeding people."}
{"text":"Went here when they first opened and everything was bad. That being said this little caesars got itself together and now is great. I don't know why it has horrible reviews. for a quick and easy experienice go here!! They are great!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that 80% of the time I come in to get pizza \"the hot-n-ready\" philosophy is not true. I have to wait for the pizza and it does get old and that's why I do not come here very often anymore."}
{"text":"I'm confused why is called, \"hot and ready.\" Whenever I go there I have to wait for my pizza. But for the price $5 you can't be that upset. Its defiantly not that great but for the price it is."}
{"text":"I came here the other day to pick up something like 35 pizzas for a work thing. They had been ordered and paid for beforehand and we had scheduled staggered pick up times, so they knew we were coming. So....  Wait, you've never been to a Little Caesar's? Their big thing is that they have a $5 pizza ready for pick up all the time. It's not the best pizza ever, and it's only slightly better than the frozen $3 pizza at Target, but it's \"hot and ready\" so I guess it's not the worst. They also have an $8 pizza that has extra meat or something, but I've never ordered it. It's probably also just ok.  Also, they have the other traditional things the other pizza places have, such as soda, breadsticks, wings... all that stuff. You can probably get a ton of food for your large group for like $20. It's certainly a deal if cost is your main concern.   Ok, that aside, the service here was actually pretty damn good. In my case, I had to pick up a ton of pizza, and they were really polite, really good about letting me know I was kinda early so it'd be like three more minutes, and I was welcome to sit and wait or whatever. On one of the other pick-ups, they were actually kinda behind on their pizzas because they said one of their two ovens was down, so they were slow. I get that stuff happens, and my pizzas were only late by about 10 minutes, so it's no big deal.   The only snafu here, and the reason I am debating bringing this place down a star, is because my first pizza order was for 16 pizzas. The guy put them all on the counter and asked \"Do you want me to help to you your car with this?\" and I said that'd be great, man, thanks. He kinda rolled his eyes and sighed and then helped me. Dude, why'd you even offer?! You could've just said \"You're all set, thanks, adios\" and it would've been cool. But, no, you had to be a jerk. Good job.   All that said, would I return here? Probably not. The pizza is only barely ok, and I'm not sure I'd want to save the $2 or whatever and go to Domino's and wait the extra ten minutes. But this was a work thing my HR had set up, and they'll probably do it again because work is cheap. So, yeah."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It seems like they are always undermanned, even during non-peak meal hours. Little Caesars's famous Hot-and-Ready pizza turns out to never actually be ready. The one person that's at the register is always struggling to keep up with the customers and frustratedly asking for help upfront. I have been to the Little Caesars a total of 4 times and I've always had the same Poot experience. Terrible management."}
{"text":"Where do I start....... HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Employees look and work like they have been working a 24hr shift with no breaks hahaha I feel sorry just watching them  waiting for our order. Training needs to happen ASAP because this location is HORRIBLE!  But love Little Caesars pizza"}
{"text":"You would think after the reviews & complaints, they would have their shit together!!! HELL NO!!! Do they really understand the \"Hot n Ready\" concept???!!! Once again HELL NO!! Get it together Caesars!!!"}
{"text":"First of all a big plus with the new drive-through option very awesome!! I do agree with some of the good and bad reviews on here I've had good experiences and bad experiences but overall the pizza does taste better than the Little Caesars on Thomas and 32nd Street, not sure why. Don't abuse the drive-thru option and Order and wait there. Be courteous to others who call ahead and pick up at the drive-thru, thats what it's for. Get your lazy ass out and order inside or call ahead, don't order from the drive thru and wait for it. That is just so inconsiderate to others. Would be nice if the owner made everyone park if ordering so others can pick up more quickly."}
{"text":"$5 pizza... What do you expect? I'm giving it 3 stars because the ladies are always friendly, the pizza is always fresh and there is always some kind of special going on. It's a cheap lunch for 2 people and there are always left overs so it's a great value. When we want really great pizza we go somewhere else... When we are in a hurry this works just fine!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 meat treat.  I was told a 15 minute wait would be required.  That's fine I understand. But waiting literally 50 minutes for a pizza? Yeah highly unacceptable and it's not like they are giving them for free and like the quality is the best. Seriously has to be the worst little caesers there is in town and the slowest. Highly under staffed. I should have gone across the street to pizza hut i probably would have paid the same about and waited alot less for better quality pizza. They need to get their sh*t together ASAP."}
{"text":"Always have had good service at this location. Food has never been wrong or of poor quality."}
{"text":"In and out on week days... $5 pizza is my go to when I don't have time to cook and or I just don't want too. On Weekends this place gets packed! The employees are nice but I think the angry rude customers stress me out."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly and so we keep returning but I'm not sure if it is just my luck, or this locations policy but the \"hot & ready\" slogan doesn't really apply here. Every time, when it's busy or not busy, I will order our pizza, the cashier calls out my order and they then put the pizzas into the oven. They cook quick, in like 5-6 minutes, but I wouldn't consider this \"READY\" it's more like \"ready to cook\". When it's busy, the wait can get pretty frustrating. Especially with only a few chairs to sit on."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go for a last minute dinner and something that's cheap and easy. Their pizzas are five dollars and hot and ready until 8 PM. After 8 PM they might not have the entire menu \"Hot N Ready\" but it's only take a few minutes for them to get your order made and ready to go. I'm more of a person about my pizza but my kids love it and the Italian cheese bread is my favorite. It's similar to deep dish pizza but no sauce, instead the thick crust with cheese and seasoning on top. It is greasy but absolutely delicious. My kids love it too and it's also reasonably priced at only $4. I recommend adding that to your order as a side dish because it is quite tasty!  The whole idea is simple and easy and fast so there's not any dining table or seating area to eat. The idea is to be able to have A takeout option that would have the pizza already ready to go and are you have to do is pay for your order. You will be in and out quickly. Designed with ease and convenience, to come in, place & pick up ur order and always in less than 10 minutes in my experience. So if you're looking for a pizza place that offers dine in, then this isn't the place. But if you're looking for an easy dinner for your family that's quick and last minute and then this is the place for you! No long wait with their \"Hot N Ready\" pizzas. Operated by teenagers and young adults with average customer service. I've been in before and had them singing waiting out front to place my order and they had no sense of urgency to come to the front or even acknowledge me.  Thankfully that was only once."}
{"text":"There's always a wait .. Isn't the point to be able to get your pizza right always ? They need more cooks in the back and more cashiers in the front. The people who work here r rude"}
{"text":"IM USUALLY NOT THIS KIND OF GUY BUT SOMETIMES A BUSINESS DESERVES TO BE PUBLICLY SLAMMED FOR A SOLID PATTERN INCOMPETENCE...There isn't a -4 rating??? So I ordered 5 deep dish pizzas, 2 cheese and 3 pepperoni... pretty simple right? Hard to really screw that up I would think?  I don't know how hard it is to actually take an order and see it through because I've never worked there but I think it would be easy with computers n stuff, or a pen and paper idk maybe it is a hard job..?  Anyway I had someone go pick the order up, he didn't know exactly what I ordered but when he came back I ended up with 4 pepperoni pizzas and 1 cheese...   ****This has been FIVE TIMES IN A ROW THEY HAVE COMPLETELY GIVIN ME A DIFFERENT ORDER I HOPE THE WORLD SEES THIS AND AVOIDS THE PLACE, drive down the road a bit further and go to another Ceasars, trust me it's worth the gas**** So that's that, ya lost a customer obviously ya don't care because the last two times I got the wrong order I brought it to their attention but yet you all STILL manage to keep a strong track record of screwing up the most important part, THE ORDER!   And again..........: another day another hot and ready half hour wait!"}
{"text":"Just terrible. I waited 15 minutes for a pizza that was suppose to be given between 5-7mins (that's what the person at the register said) he couldn't even remember my name nor apologize. This place needs some serious management!"}
{"text":"Little Caesers is the bomb, but I can't for the life of me figure out how they have NO waiting seats in such an open area. There's SO much room, the least they could do is add a couple chairs or stools for customers waiting."}
{"text":"Nothing says come get food from here like employes sitting right out frt. on the rocks smoking. Then one runs in as you pull up and stands behind the counter after tossing her cigarette butt in the big pile of them in the rocks. Oh and no hand washing was done, she just ran to the counter to help me. The pizza is good but they obviously need a manager to control the employees so that they front of the establishment looks inviting."}
{"text":"Straight comedy! Girl with long black hair and red glasses is a savage! I walked in 59mins until closing and she said there trying to close and people like me make her night longer. Then she was rushing me to buy a pizza. That's savage! Y'all hiring?"}
{"text":"This location is the worse I tried to call on my way from work so that my food is ready they are ignoring the phone.  When i got there of course I'm thinking ok so they are. It taking phone orders so they must have some hot and ready pizza.  Oh heck naw i have to wait 15 mins for a cheese pizza and I told him if they would have answered the phone 20 mins ago I would have my order.  Smh!! You get what you pay for.  I will find Dominoes"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to get your \"hot and ready\" pizza!  Every time I go in there they are busy and have pizza in the heaters but they always tel me it's a 15 minute wait! It is NEVER a 15 min wait!  I'm always there for about 45 mins! And have to ask for my order every time otherwise I wouldn't get it. From now on I will go to hungry howies! Better pizza anyway!"}
{"text":"I was helping a friend for her daughter's birthday party by picking up the pizza for her. She called this location at 9am and placed the order to be picked up at 2:45pm and told me the total was about $40. I showed up on the dot and the staff says they don't have the order. They just blankly stare at me until I ask if they can make it now. They said \"oh..yeah. It'll take 10-12 minutes.\" Twenty minutes later I hear the staff talking amongst each other and a girl says \"yeah there's supreme pizzas over there, one for --- and two for Crystal\" These people have no idea what they're doing. One just came up to me saying the rest will be out in \"a couple minutes\".  They had the order the whole time and didn't know it since they failed to communicate with one another. Then they took over double the time they said the pizzas would be ready. So now the kids are at the party with no food.   Oh, and nothing was done about the inconvenience."}
{"text":"On Friday night I take my kids for carry out pizza. Knowing that expecting a little wait for our 2pizzas and a 2 liter of soda and crazy bread?!? I understand the hectic atmosphere during the Friday night rush. But 45 mins not exaggerating. Really I could have gotten delivery 30mins or it's free. After seeing the  3 Rd person leave. I went into check on my kids who was waiting. After expressing my concern for the extrmely long wait. The lady didn't say anything refunded our money and gave us the pizza.  Leaving now a happy customer. Thank you for turning my frown from up side down to a smile. Great !! Thank you."}
{"text":"Knowing that this place opened at 10:30 I called at 10am and asked if it was possible to place an order for my pizzas to be ready for pick up at 10:30 when they opened. Knowing that I was going to need 6 for a work event and didn't want to make other customers wait if I bought them out. The guy (boy) that answered the phone said \"uhm no you can't do a phone order until 10:45\"! Ok. So I go there at 10:40 which is 10 minutes after they're scheduled to open. There's 4 customers in front of me, one cashier at the register and the girl couldn't get the transaction done without calling someone from the back to help which happened to be probably the boy who answered the phone earlier. A few minutes later another worker comes out from the back to help on the register to get the line down. And of course I have to wait for my pizza because I ordered so many. My biggest gripe is probably the lack of customer service and work ethics. It's hard for me to accept mediocre or non existent customer service coming from a retail background of over 20 years."}
{"text":"I don't know about all these bad reviews but I think this is the best one in Phoenix! Great customer service and my pizza was actually done when I got there unlike all the other ones in the valley! :)"}
{"text":"Chicken shit mothafukas cant do anything right , by far the worst place I've been to never again. All of the staff are a bunch of morons that includes the manager !!"}
{"text":"It's pizza.  It's kind of tough to mess that up completely.    All Italian places are the same where the red sauce can make or break.  Caesars is more on the spicy side versus sweet, so keep that in mind when going.  Overall good for convenience."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. This location has been here for as long as I can remember so I doubt they care about any reviews. When I came in here last I wanted a extra most pizza and the wait was 50mins the cashier said. I told him fine since there is a gamestop next door. Now 50 mins is ridiculous to wait for a pizza that should be ready when you get there. I can back at 45 mins and had to wait another 45 mins for the pizza. By then I told him I couldn't wait anymore and he said he will give me the $5 pizza instead and throw in some wings since the pizza isn't going to be ready. Another customer was upset for having to wait the 45 mins and asked for a manager. The cashier said \"I would love to see the manager also. She hasn't been back in 3 days and always take days off all the time and it's just him and 1 guy in the back\" worst customer service ever"}
{"text":"Back in the day Little Caesars offered not just Pizza, but Pizza Pizza.  I even worked at a location in Southern California one summer while I was in high school.  No word on just what day that was, as I don't want to put a date on just how old I am.  Then they vanished.  But now, as the chain hits their 50th anniversary, they are back with a slightly new concept.  The cartoonish Caesar is still on the boxes, and the stores look about the same, but instead of selling two pizzas for a low, low price, they have a quick-serve model where you walk in and buy pre-made pies out of a rack behind the cashiers (you can also order specialty pizzas if you like, but where's the fun in that?).  Generally this is limited to cheese and pepperoni, but during dinner hours (5-8pm, I believe) you can also get their \"three meat\" pizza, and of course they have their Crazy Bread and Italian Cheese Bread (yummy).  You can even add their dipping sauces for an extra charge ($0.60 I think).  Certainly not the best pie in town, but when you don't have to wait for it and you're in a pinch coming up with dinner, it's not a bad deal at all.  The breads may be the best deal in the bunch."}
{"text":"Love the Italian cheesy bread, just like a deep dish with the sauce on the side. Also addicted to the lunch special. One deep dish and a drink for $5."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but customer service is so bad, manager was yelling at her employees. Didn't look professional at all"}
{"text":"There's a lot of Pizza places around but this one has been the most consistent.  They're located at the corner of Stouffville Main Street and 10th Line.  Just make sure you go to the North-East corner as the intersection itself is a little large.  The location itself is really nice because if you live near the eastern part of Stouffville Main Street, then it's a very convenient location as there's no other pizza place around there.  The staff here are very friendly and I've gone so much that they're starting to remember who I am now.  As mentioned, the pizza's consistently good and on very affordable.  They also have options like Deep Dish Pizzas and Italian Cheese Bread, both of which I recommend if you're really hungry.  They also have dips for your pizza crusts such as Garlic and Cheese."}
{"text":"Understaffed, disorganized.  It should not take a half hour to get a pizza.  Definitely not worth the lower price."}
{"text":"Every time I go and ask for a \"hot n ready\" deep dish-they NEVER have it! I have to go ahead and order it and wait. Also several other times I have called it in and ask for extra pepperoni and they have forgotten to add it. This has happened several times. Also I have placed phone orders and when I get there, they have given it away to other customers. This location needs help! Not cool."}
{"text":"Everyone under estimates the pizza artists working at this Mom and pop American staple. The experience from start to finish cannot be described in one yelp review.... the staff took customer service to a whole new level, the cheese was so aged to perfection that the whole family melted with this buffet of flavors surrounding our taste buds. The sauce reminded me of an early Tuscan sunrise the warm robust flavor took me to heights I've never experienced before. The crust oh man that crust the buttery, flaky, soft, but with a rough doughy exterior left me screaming for more and the best part about it all THE PRICE... 5$ plus tax for A PIZZA never have I ever been more satisfied with a fine dining experience in my entire life. 10/10 will definitely be returning for another slice of heaven!!!!"}
{"text":"If u could give no stars I would. No wonder it's $5 a box , there's no taste to the pizza what so ever. Wong be eating little ceasers , I rather stick with Pizza Hut honestly."}
{"text":"Says on yelp they are open till 11 but they are closed at 10. Need to update on this so people like me don't waste my time coming here. Thanks"}
{"text":"Burnt old cheese on stale dough pizza.  Shoddy service. Manager in charge was unnecessarily loud to show she's in charge. Gut feeling, she \"no sale'd\" the register and might've pocketed the $. No receipt offered, so franchisees and/or corporate ownership: be warned. Check some video tape, and count your inventory and drawers. I won't be back until October when TWD is on TV for inspiration. Tough to navigate through the Walkers all around this dump."}
{"text":"I expect only a few things from little Caesars. 1) pizza, hot n ready, 2) they take my money in exchange for pizza, 3) they don't have an argument in front of customers and then awkwardly try to make conversation and try to defend their actions. The only thing they did remotely right was take the money. Oh, and I've been standing here for 20 minutes waiting for pizza that was meant to take 8 minutes."}
{"text":"Pizza is alright for what it is, my review is on the staff and customer service, they are slow and lazy, line out of the door and 1 person in register and the other guys is slowly walking around, seriously? Hot and ready means hot and ready, not 8 min on my pizza, also it's right on MLK so full of a bunch of thugs. So staff, move a little faster and cook more pizzas, take your orders faster, and and don't focus on your \"homies\" and get all the customers served"}
{"text":"My friend bought a Deep Dish Pizza and he took a bite of the pizza and found a chicken bone in the pizza. So, be careful eating the pizza. I called the Manager and she wasn't really helpful."}
{"text":"$5 Hot and Ready Pizza...   The quality of the pizza serves as a reminder that you purchased an entire pizza for $5.   The Hot and Ready Pizza that I picked up seemed as if it has been sitting for a while. The crust was soggy and the cheese was chewy. After picking up a slice of pizza, there was a grease stain, an outline of where the slice of pizza was on the cardboard box.   Considering the pizzas are ready when you walk in (no waiting) and that it costs $5, there isn't anything more you can expect.   The mediocre quality is a direct consequence of the price and convenience."}
{"text":"So this place has a lot of potential for five stars.  Ian's pizza is allegedly all the rage in Madison so of course I went there first and it is AVERAGE in comparison to this \"cheap\" chain restaurant.  I ordered a vegetarian pizza with pepperoni. The crust was thin, just the way I love it.  They were very generous with the vegetables.  Unfortunately it took forever for the pizza."}
{"text":"My brother ordered THREE hot and ready pepperoni pizzas. We didn't notice until later that we got TWO pepperoni and one Combination! We DID NOT order that!!! But thank you very much for the awesome mistake! ;D  5 stars! But really 2 stars because it's service."}
{"text":"This place is a mess, the moment you walk in the door no greeting and the cashier was finishing playing with her phone and just started staring at me. (Still no greeting) The cooks come to the front every time they seen the door open. After I greeted the cashier with a good morning; I asked the cashier twice if there were any deep dish cheese or pepperoni pizzas ready and she just looked at me with a blank face. I than pointed at the picture and she understood.  I placed an order 2 deep dish pizzas one cheese, one veggie Total $22.75, I came back 20mins later with my order being one cheese deep dish, one original veggie and one original pepperoni pizza. When I explained to the cashier how my order was wrong. The cashier nor the manager apologized for the mess up but wanted me to pay more to fix my order the way I wanted it. Ugh! so I explained the cashier made the mistake not me; the manager replied: \"ok but it will be extra because it's deep dish\". So I asked for my money back gave them all three incorrect pizzas. While the manager was getting me my refund the cashier continued playing with her phone. The cashier than placed the pizzas back in the baking rack. Can we say \"Health violation\" she did end up taking one out of three out after the manger told her No No... Will I return SUPER NEGATIVE customer service is key as well as cleanness and this place lacks both.  One star is for affordable ;)"}
{"text":"every time I go to get a pizza-which they promote as 'grab and go' I have to wait for it to be made. I can live with fresh made pizza, but advertise it that way- do not advertise that you are the go to pizza place for hot and ready pizza if I have to wait for it to come out of the oven every time I come in to get one.  dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Worst experience twice placed orders for pick up told 20 mins and then get there and have to wait another 20 mins because it wasn't ready or they gave my order to someone else."}
{"text":"The employees were friendly, happy, and professional. My order was ready and correct and there were no angry customers yelling about their order being screwed up like the other one on cheyenne!"}
{"text":"Worst Little Caesars in Las Vegas! They never have any Italian cheesy bread ready and if you order some and sit and watch they don't even start it for 5 minutes after you order because they are too busy screwing around, chatting, eating. And then if you're lucky they made it right! That's right they have made Italian cheesy bread wrong! I got home with it once and it had sauce on it, it was a pizza!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I love little Caesars pizza but this particular location is beyond terrible. The staff is extremely unprofessional the pizza is never ready. So that kills the whole hot n ready slogan they have. I watched one of the dough preparers not use any gloves and touch everything in the dang area. I called in ahead of time for one cheese pizza and asked for two jalapeño cheese sauces and the guy taking my order acted dumb as if he didn't know what that was. He didn't ask for my name or anything. I had to rudely tell him how to do his dang job."}
{"text":"Strictly on the service... Cause we know what we are getting at Lil C's.   Amazing! The guy behind the counter (didn't catch his name but he was a tall gentleman with glasses) was a gem. Full of life and made nice small talk about the weather, but it wasn't annoying the way some people ask about the outside world. He seemed genuinely interested in today's forecast. Anyway, he was a pleasure to be served by and I hope that he continues to put out good into the  world."}
{"text":"Came here a Saturday early evening, ordered two pizzas and they where ready immediately. The lady at the counter was friendly and gave my daughter a cookie/toy. No complaints here, in and out."}
{"text":"I have been to this location maybe 7 or 8 times in the past two years.  Not once, including tonight, have they ever had a hot and ready pizza of any kind available!!!  The price can't be beat but the service is ridiculous!!!  They can't even offer a free sauce or something!  If this is a franchise location, the franchise needs to remove this agreement because it is giving the company a horrible name."}
{"text":"Little Caesar's, I hate to admit that one of your lame promotional tactics has worked on me, despite much resistance on my part.  There is no way I'd ever pick up a phone, call you, and deliberately ask that you be in charge of dinner for the evening.  But when I'm already in your shopping center for other reasons and I know that neither my wife nor I feel like cooking dinner or going out on a Friday night, then your $5 Hot n' Ready pizza may just hit the spot.  Let's just keep one thing straight: you will never be a mainstay for us, and if we ever invite you into our home, it's merely because we were desperate and you were cheap and available.  Don't think that we'll ever like you for anything other than $5 pizza, because we won't.  And after we've had our way with your cheap nastiness, we'll hide all the evidence and never tell anyone about it.  Thanks for being there for us, Hot n Ready menu!  This is the one and only thing that makes Little Caesar's worthwhile."}
{"text":"Out of all of the Little Caesars locations I have visited, this has to be the best one. The Rood family takes the time to make sure that every order that comes out the door is right and to the customer's specifications. They run it as a small-town family business, which I appreciate. This is where I get great service and good pizza in Waunakee."}
{"text":"Fast, tastes good, alright service. It's a $5 pizza that is ready when you are. Really, how can it be all that bad?"}
{"text":"I called to check how late they were open. They said 2300. I get there at 2240, the sign says they close at 2300. Their door is locked and they ignore my knocking. There are pizzas in the earners though. I call and was told they closed. When I pointed out they are supposed to still be open I'm met with attitude.   Way to win customer loyalty."}
{"text":"Well, I finally did it.  Pizza snob/conoisseur here decided to stop at my local 'Little Caesars' to try out their inexpensive, ready made pizza, their deep dish pizza to be exact.  I believe that the deep dish style is only ready-made after 4PM, so I had to wait all but 8 to 10 minutes for them to prepare it.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, and quantity of deep dish you get for a measly 8 dollars!  And the pizza tastes very good too!  It's no gourmet deep dish, but it is flavorful, and tastes fresh and cheesy!  Sometimes, less expensive tastes great, as I found out!  I will be coming back to Little Caesars in the future."}
{"text":"Everyone here is extremely slow. Also, saw three employees in the parking lot chugging off a 5th of Jack Daniels. They could have at least offered a pull off the bottle."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 mins to be told the pizza was not even put into the oven. You could tell this is most of their first jobs but they act like its a joke"}
{"text":"Went online looking for this particular store. The website had the option to add stuffed crust for  $3.18 (for each pizza)... HELL YES !   My SIL gets there to pick it up and we've been charged $5 each pizza to \"upgrade\". My SIL explains the situation with the online, guy at the counter tells him he knows not why this is but it is the was it is... For this price I could have gone with the other guys and had more options/deals. We did not get a discount or a sorry... just heres your order.   I hope someone from the store cares enough to make this right.   Pizza was DELICIOUS, Experience and getting my money taken left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Food is just fine. You have to call ahead if you want deep dish. Be prepared that Ericka will not provide good customer service and is very rude when taking the order. Tastes great!"}
{"text":"Don't expect for your pizza to be \"hot and ready\" if you go around dinner time. There has been a few times I've gone to grab a quick dinner and there was a 20+ min wait. Other than that the pizza is good for the price. I really liked the deep dish!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back. Seeing as I was the second person in line I expected to at least have my food before the long line of 5 people were behind me. Also being that I ordered a $5 lunch combo. He told me there would be a 15 min wait. However i saw 2 $5 lunch combos just sitting there. I patiently waited as everyone behind me ordered got their food and left, including another customer who ordered the same exact thing quickly received his food. He grabbed one of the pizzas that had been there since i ordered. I didn't understand why I had to wait 15 min for a pizza that was already done.  Mind you I am on my lunch break as I'm sure majority of the people here were. But still why did he make me wait on a pizza that was obviously done and ready to take. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Placed an order on the phone and they said it would be ready when I get there.. Took me 20 minutes to get here and they haven't even started on my pizza. I hate this place they suck really bad. They don't care though.. Just to top it off I'm the only one inside and it's 10:50am.."}
{"text":"Apparently the words \"hot and ready\" are just that -words and not an actual action and goal! Disappointing to come In and be told that we now have to wait ten minutes for what was promised as being ready when we walk in!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars is for the quality of the pizza. We ordered 6 of the extra most bestest online 2 hours prior to our desired pick up time of 5:45.  We also paid online, so need to hassle at pick up time.   Arrived at the location at 5:40 stood in a line of over 15 people and advised of my order. I was told my order was \"NOT\" ready and it would be about 4 minutes. Mind you at this time after waiting in that line, it is passed the pick up request time. I waited 8 minutes, then asked again about my order. I was told another 4 minutes.  I finally walked out the door with my pizza's at 5:56.  16 minutes after arrival, 11 minutes passed the order time, that you had a 2 hour online notice of.    There was plenty of staff on hand and it was a busy \"fight night\" Saturday.  My thoughts on this are the staff on site are not trained on how to execute the orders in a timely and organized fashion.    As you all know all L.C. locations are small and are not comfortable for people to stand in a line of 15 deep.  This is a corporate problem, not a local problem.  We all know L.C. company is aware of this, and they will never fix the issue; have to save $$$ some how.    I prefer the extra most bestest over the basic $5.00 pizza.  The pizza was good, hot and fresh, so you all know I will be back.    My complaint is this; make a disclaimer on your ordering process that says \" your order is for a desired pick up time only, there is not a chance it is going to be ready when you walk in the door unless you arrive 20 minutes late.    Most of the people in the location were complaining and many left without ordering.  One lady began to yell, \"why should she wait in line for pick up, when she ordered online and it should be ready when she walks in the door.\"  They got her pizzas to her right away!  I could have yelled and fussed to, but what for."}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody says, but I love their pizza. You just have to order it the right way .. HEART ATTACK STYLE ! Trust me, you won't regret it!! This location is usually busy so I always call ahead. I work down the street so its easy and convenient. And another thing, ask for some cookies... They say they are for the kids but I always manage to get at least 1 pack just for me"}
{"text":"I came to this Little Cesaer's for third time and did not receive my pizza hot and ready. Today between 11 AM and 12 PM I arrived for $5 lunch combo and it was not ready. This is the third time that this has happened. The other two times was between 5 and 8 PM for a Deep dish pizza and the same result. I shop at this location to support local businesses, but if I have to wait on my lunch hour for a hot and ready pizza, I will have to take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"3rd time I've gone to this location and had a issue. \"We are have a issue we will opening late\" ok no problem I understand but it's noon your employees are sitting counting the drawer while I am at the locked door. Another women goes to the door as I'm leaving and knocks on the glass \"hey what time is late?\" Instead of answering her question or acknowledging her the employee runs to the back. You don't do online ordering or pick up or delivery. FAIL!!!!"}
{"text":"drive up window and five $$ pizza best idea ever! And they hire the nicest kids ever!!! Great service!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and always have a pleasant experience, they can get pretty busy at times, so the wait can get a little long but the employees are always friendly. Our cashier Aldo was very nice, the food is always hot and never have had an issue here. We actually drive to this one even though there is one much closer, but unfortunately the employees at the other location are some of the worst."}
{"text":"My fiancé literally watched the older woman slide our pizza in the box with her bare hands. Disgusting."}
{"text":"It's a $5 pizza, do I need to say more ! Only downside to this location is everybody in centennial hills seems to go at the exact same time and your going to have to wait.  It's \"hot and ready\" with a 10 min wait most nights."}
{"text":"Your typical little Cesar's pizza experience , kids working up front and back that don't seem too enthused. The pizza is always great though & you cannot beat the price."}
{"text":"One star is more than deserves. Hot and ready is a joke and little ceasers should be sued for false advertising. Ordered online and my pizza wasn't ready for another 50 minutes after my promised ready time."}
{"text":"One star is being generous. \"Hot and ready\" is a joke. Ordered on line and arrived 15 minutes later only to be told it was going to be another 20 minutes. 45 minutes later my pizza was finally ready. Horrible management. Didn't seem to care about the customers waiting for pizza or the dozen or so who didn't order or got a refund because the wait was too long."}
{"text":"Want cheap pizza fast .. Pepperoni hot & ready never disappoints .. Never a wait.. You run in, they hand you a hot pizza .. It's $5.00 well spent. They also stock cold Pepsi products .. you get what you pay for.."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. On hold forever so i hang up and just go there. I get there and wait 10 mins while the lady in the long pony tail pretends to be busy and im the only 1 here then when i order my pizza thats spost to be hot and ready she says it will be 15 mins. So i left hungry and had to go back to work hungry."}
{"text":"A great option for a quick and easy dinner, especially if you're on a budget. This location is right by my work and the babe didn't feel like cooking, so I dropped in here to pick up a hot and ready. Wanted to get a deep dish, but the wait would be about 10 minutes and I was in a rush. They had just brought out a new batch of pepperoni pizzas, so decided to get one of those along with an order of garlic bread and marinara for just over $8. Can't beat a dinner for that price. The pizza was delicious as well as the garlic bread. Pizza had the right amount of cheese and pepperoni on it.   Clean place and polite staff.  Will come back again when I'm in the mood for a quick and cheap pizza."}
{"text":"So I am a lover of anything cheesy and Little Caesars is a place I come often for a quick cheap meal. I've been to many different locations and they all seem about the same as far as service and the quality of their food. Each location comes with its ups and downs and this location is no different.   I've been to this location now twice and both times were a totally different experience. First time I wanted the stuffed crust with pepperoni. I was told it would be about 10-15 minutes as there was only one other person ahead of me waiting on their pizza. After about 25 minutes I asked about the status of my pizza and was told that they messed up on it and it would be another 10-15 minutes as they made it correctly and was just now putting it in the oven. It would have been nice of them to inform me of the mistake without having me waiting around so long. I ended up just taking the pizza they messed up as I didn't want to wait around any longer. What I mean by messed up is that they made it cheese and not pepperoni..no big deal to me.   Next time I came, I just got one of the hot and ready pizza and was in and out in like 2 minutes. That is more like it. I don't want to have to wait around for a pizza or I'd go to a sit-down restaurant.  This location is small for the number of people that come here. Both times the place got packed and people ended up having to stand outside while they waited for their food.    Food is hot and pretty good tasting and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I got crazy bread from this stupid place and they didnt give me any sauce! What a waste of my time, gas, and money. Im hungry and cant even eat these dry ass bread sticks without sauce. Dumb."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible customer service. My son enjoys going in and ordering our pizza, well today 7/26/17 the stupid ass high school kids in the back heard the counter person say my sons name and they all starting laughing and mocking him and saying loud enough how stupid of a name that was. I get it's not a huge deal to adults but my 10 year old was crushed when he came out. I have been a loyal customer of this location for over a year. I hope the owner reads this cause you just lost a customer"}
{"text":"@littlecaesars is mismanaged at Sunset & Valle Verde inHenderson NV called in order, watched them give away my order, and told me to wait 12 more min.  PizzaHut here I come!"}
{"text":"Slow AF! Seriously,  we called an order in and gave them time and it still was a 25 minute wait. Go any where else."}
{"text":"Hot & Ready pizzas are never ready and have to wait at least 10 min. Employees all screwing around in back, laughing, joking, screaming, a complete party scene back there. No wonder pizzas aren't ready. The poor cashier has to stand up front facing customers telling them there's a wait while her coworkers are messing around in the kitchen. Whoever owns this place is a fool who doesn't watch his business."}
{"text":"Strange, as a kid for I remember that I did not like the pizza they have. So for the last, say 15 years I avoided them. Well, for what ever reason I decide to get a pizza from them. And I was surprised.  The pizza was good.   I did not have their deep dish as, in general I don't like thick crust, but what I did have was wonderfully good. And I will be eating more here."}
{"text":"They one get one start because I couldn't give them o ... first off I had to call 3 times before someone decided to answer then first thing they tell me is if I'm not here before 10 they won't even make the pizza ... then I get here and have to wait 10-15 minutes before they ask what I ordered ... then the cashier decided that he doesn't wanna hand me my change and he puts in on counter and leaves its I have now been here 30 mins for a pizza I pre called ahead of time ... they are rude don't acknowledge anyone I hope the pizza taste decent ... and it's greasy and stick to the box.... never go again I hope they fix this there a reason it's 2 star I only ate pizza cause 1paid and two I was starving but won't be back   How is that store open and they allow that kind of behaviour"}
{"text":"The little man will fill your belly for cheap. Good for the working man. We need to keep all the money we can so we can pay taxes. Cheap pizza and taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.  What more is there to say."}
{"text":"Worst little Cesar's ever!!  The staff are kids goofing around, poor hygiene and very unsanitary!  Watched a staff member drop a pizza on the counter and threw it back in the box. Nasty.   When he was confronted about it he said he didn't want me to wait. Quality and safe handling is not important to this franchise. Go to Barros instead"}
{"text":"You can't really beat a $5 pepperoni pizza. I haven't eaten at little Caesars since I was a child. Being that I wanted a pizza and was on a budget thought I'd give this place a try. Service was super fast in and out very quickly. Paid and immediately had my pizza in hand. Usually I eat Pizza Hut but for the fast service and decent taste for $5 I would return."}
{"text":"Terrible. I get the pizza is not expensive but it can at least be fresh cheese not room temperature, crusty hard cheese that when you take one bite all falls off the pizza in one sheet. Disgusting. And this wasn't just once, happened about 3 or 4 times but never complained since it's so cheap but this last time was enough and I took the pizza back and will never be going here again. Don't be cheap and just spend more money on Barros or Pizza Hut across the street."}
{"text":"Service here sucked. I was told I would have a 15 minute wait to get some Italian cheesy bread, and it up waiting 30 minutes only to ask for refund and they couldn't even get a manager to come give me my refund. Ridiculous service, will not go there nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"The pizza is the same as every other Little Caesars, but the service here is SO slow. Even when you call ahead, it's still a 15+ minute wait. They should consider changing their slogan: \"Hot and Ready... in about 20 minutes\""}
{"text":"We actually had a few times where we had to wait 10-15 minutes so we figured if we called it in we would get it by the time we got to that side of town. It was a Thursday night at 6:30, we knew there would be a dinner rush, went ahead & ordered a pepperoni Hot & Ready with a side of BBQ wings. They said 45 minutes, so we said that's perfect since we were up in North LV. We get there & it's jammed packed. Now there is no line indicating who's ordering or who's picking up so everyone just stands there waiting to be called or forming random  lines! It's now 7:30 & when we finally get to the kid who's so behind, frazzled & rushed he said our wings aren't done it will be another 10 minutes, mind you it's passed the 45 minute call we had placed. We were about to leave when the manager (different uniform from everyone else) points him to the direction where everything is pilling up & our wings have been ready. Now if they have 2 cashiers, more employees or had lines to indicate ordering & pick ups this can go smoothly. Pizza was hot & good but wings weren't as tasty. We probably won't be coming here during dinner time anymore."}
{"text":"Promised to review Little Caesar's deep dish pizza.  Well today I stopped there at 5 pm. Customer traffic was impressive.  Very little to no waiting time. The deep dish pizza comes with pepperoni, which one small bite will give me heart burn for a month of Sunday's, the very friendly guy behind the counter promised a cheese only in less then 10 minutes.  Only took 8 minutes.  The quality was perfect. ...taste excellent.  8 large square pieces, actually 2 sections of 4 . Best deal in Las Vegas for only $8.00"}
{"text":"Typical Little Ceasers. Hot and ready pizza's for $5. I was in and out in about 4 minutes. But wait....WAH!!! What pizza place doesn't have parmesan cheese?! Sad face! :("}
{"text":"It's pretty gross, but just barely edible and if you drown it in ranch it's not bad.  ---Yelpers give me a break I was buzzed and it was only $5 bucks."}
{"text":"Great Pizza at a reasonable price.   Our favorite is the cheese in crust/pepperoni; but the pinapple and ham is also very good. Many other options and pizza toppings too!   The cinnamon bites dessert is pretty tasty and would be great for breakfast even!  Sauces are 2 for $1. The garlic butter is another one of our favorites! Always pick up a few more to put in the refrigerator for dipping other breads & snacks too!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the nice employees. I called ahead to order four pizzas and they were ready when I arrived. The reason for only three stars is the quality. Not sure what I expected for $5 a pizza, but everyone has ended up with a stomach ache. Bummer."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I walked into this location due to the long drive-thru line, and ordered one pepperoni pizza. None were ready yet so I had to wait for them to make it, alongside two other waiting customers. While I waited, I saw a tall white man who I believe is a manager, placing pepperonis on a pizza WITHOUT ANY GLOVES ON. I couldn't believe my eyes... When he was done applying the pepperonis, he placed the pizza on another counter and began on the next one. I was DISGUSTED because I saw the same man using a cordless phone a couple of minutes prior and I don't think he washed his hands. Nonetheless, it is absolutely insane for an employee to make someone's food without protective gloves! I immediately asked another employee for a refund and they called the tall man to the register where he refunded my purchase, and then walked back to continue making pizzas. I never plan to return to this location again, and I urge you not to either."}
{"text":"Lines are always so long! This time I just turned around and went home, after seeing the line. It's not even 2pm. There shouldn't be this long of a wait time. The rating at this location is very accurate. What a shame."}
{"text":"Not sure why the negative reviews, I was in and out in no time with hot pizza and crazy bread. Good prices, service was fine, didn't have a line, no problem with parking, so I'm not sure why this isn't rated higher. But I'll def return."}
{"text":"The customer service is extremely bad. I understand that when it gets busy, the employees are going to get frustrated but that's absolutely no excuse to take it out on the customers."}
{"text":"I can't give half a star. We have been to 5 different little Caesars and not one had any thing \"hot and ready!!\" Only a few people there and everyone had to wait.   Not the best motto to advertise.  Won't be eating with this company again."}
{"text":"Long ago, I decided that I was more of a Dominos person than a Little Caesar's guy, however once in a great while, I'll try Little Caesar's again, just to see if anything has changed.       I did this last night, and back to Dominos it is!  I stopped by this Little Caesar's yesterday evening a little before 8PM.   I know from past experience, and as other reviewers have mentioned, that if there's lots of customers inside, not to even bother because it's just chaos.  But there was just one customer, so I decided to go in & place an order for a cheese \"Deep Deep Dish\" pizza & had a coupon for a free order of Crazy Bread from order-taker/cashier Natalie.  My receipt indicates the order was placed at 7:52PM.  I decided to go walk to the Smith's grocery store & bank, then returned to Little Caesar's about 10 minutes later.   After dealing with one new customer, Natalie told me that my pizza would be ready in \"just a couple more minutes\" so I sat down & waited.  From where I sat, I could see back into the preparation area, and watched as one of the two pizza-makers used a dirty rag in his ungloved-hand to clean the front of his blue vinyl apron, then go back to touching the dough...   About 5 minutes later, Natalie then explained there was a problem with their oven, apparently my pizza wasn't thoroughly cooked, and that it'd be ready \"in a few more minutes.\"   At 8:13PM, my pizza was finally ready.  Natalie handed it to me, failing to remember that I was also owed an order of Crazy Bread, so I had to remind her of that.  Got the pizza home, the Crazy Bread tasted very good (cheese & butter -- how could it not?!) though it seemed under-cooked -- the bread was very doughy.   As for the pizza, despite the \"Deep! Deep Dish\" name, it's a pretty standard, non-Chicago type deep-dish, about 1\" thick.  Most of the flavor was the dough -- not a good overall balance of cheese, sauce & bread.     I just finished the leftover pizza now, after adding some flavor via garlic salt & the pizza sauce that came with the bread sticks.  So in-terms of the pizza, maybe it's just a matter of personal choice, but in terms of the service -- both last night & the two or three other times in the past 4 years I've decided to visit this particular Little Caesar's -- the business needs help.   Natalie was nice, but lacked the customer-service/managerial ambition to at least offer me a free soda, extra order of Crazy Bread, or simply a sincere apology for having to wait over 20 minutes for my simple order to be ready, especially on an evening where they were not at all busy.    Hopefully, this was my final lesson from Little Caesar's in general, or this location in particular."}
{"text":"DOES NOT DESERVE 1 STAR BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE :(   1st time there was Nasty!!! They guy behind the counter bagging bread sticks pulls his cell phone out of his pants pocket to talk to his mom ( not wearing gloves mind you) finishes his conversation and proceeds to bag the breadsticks. Do you know how dirty and nasty cell phones are not to mention the inside of front pocket... gross!!! Cant get a super simple order right! I am so done stopping here.   2nd time in,  I was in a big hurry I went in and ordered a thin crust cheese pizza and 2 orders of breadsticks ( they only had one bag in the warmer),told them i would be back in 15 min to  pick up my order.  When i arrived my thin crust was NOT thin crust and still only had 1 bag in the warmer.  The dumb cashier never told me they did not make thin crust pizzas there so apparently completely ignored my order and made a regular cheese pizza and when i asked him for the 2nd bag of breadsticks he says oh im sorry i can make them right now!!! R u kidding me NO i stopped in to place an order and gave them 20 minutes to do it in 5 min longer than i expected and he wants me to wait ANOTHER 10 min for breadsticks????   3rd time in, I walk in and request one of those 5.00 lunch combos for my daughter but cheese instead of pepperoni, another idiot working that day tells me we only make pepperoni we cant serve you just a cheese pizza lunch combo.  Are you serious???? All you have to do is LEAVE THE PEPPERONI OFF and pop it in the oven.  He says to me we cant do that but you can pick them off if you want.  Yea okay so I will just serve my daughter a pizza with nasty pepperoni grease and no cheese cuz you know when you take the pepperoni off the cheese comes right off with it. ( i didnt say this to him but i was thinking it) needless to say I got in my car and drove the extra miles to A REAL LITTLE CAESARS yep lindsay and warner!!! Crappy crappy crappy is all i have to say about this place. I drive the extra miles and go to LITTLE CAESARS on lindsay and warner every time now, they got their stuff together over there. This place on GILBERT AND GUADALUPE is NOTHING but a big waist of time period.    The owners should be embarrassed and should request the help of a real LITTLE CAESARS owner to help save this place."}
{"text":"Order just a cheese pizza and crazy bread. Waited 20 minutes and they asked what we ordered, they just pulled out the pizza and bread like it has been there for 15 minutes! Didn't even apologize about the wait."}
{"text":"For what it is it's good. The pizza I s hot and reDy if you want pepperoni, 20 min average for special orders.  The staff is pleasant, the waiting room isn't  dirty but it isn't clean, it looks like it needs paint, tile, etc.  The pizza is better than Pizza Hut, not as good as Dominoes. For $5 though, really, it's flavorful. Plenty of cheese, the sauce is too tomatoey, but as long as you aren't just getting cheese it isn't noticeable.  The Cheesy Bread is ok, kinda tastes like it sounds, folks. Lol  All the food is just fine. They have sodas, desserts, lunch. Every pizza is a personal pizza if you believe in yourself and try hard. Parking isn't sufficient, there are six spots nearby and after that you're gonna hike."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service! They do not live by their moto! Always end up waiting 30-40 min for 2 pepperonis. That's ridiculous. And to top it off, their employees are rude little teenagers that give attitude when you ask them if your order is done because it's been more than \"10min\" ( as they say is their waiting time, and they tell mostly everyone that) if I could give 0 stars I would!!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house, and we have ordered 3 times by phone prior to coming to pick up a pizza that has EXTRA SAUCE, first time it has only half baked, one side cooked the other side and inside was raw dough. the Second time we picked up one with EXTRA SAUCE, it was dry as a bone.. they just gave us some random pizza sitting there.. the Third time (and final time we go there) the pizza was burned on the bottom, actually black on the edges... We couldn't eat it. I called them and the kid said \"oh, well we are busy and have a lot of pizzas going\"... I said \"well that will be the last time I come there\". he said \"oh, sorry\" and hung up abruptly. We used to go to the one on Horizon Ridge and Eastern for 7 years.. NEVER HAD A BAD PIZZA.. NEVER ONCE...."}
{"text":"I just don't get why kids like the card board pizza from this place and if it was not for them I would not ever consider eating at a place like this. they are just outright awful.  From the rude customer service to the blah pizza, I avoid this place as much as possible"}
{"text":"It's always hot and ready. What more do you want? It's little caesars.       Best little caesars I've ever had. For realz"}
{"text":"This is walking distance from my house and I can only say the pizza gets better every time I go. The first time I came here was last year and I was disappointed, but they have redeemed themselves. I usually buy the supreme or pepperoni and cheese yum. I'm not comparing it to Chicago pizza, this chain had its own criteria."}
{"text":"Had to do another review because at this point, it's gotten ridiculous. MUST READ!  EVERYTIME I have ordered pizza for pick up, we are waiting 20-30 mins standing there because the pizza was NEVER made! I could be wrong maybe it was made but they probably gave it away.  I ordered 2 pizzas and 1 was a special order. We placed that order 20 mins ahead and my husband ended up standing in line for 35 mins so they could make our order. And guess what?! We got someone else's order for 1 of the pizzas! So... SORRY Katheryn, we got your half cheese and half pepperoni pizza that we did not order. The management here does not care about training their staff. They handle money and touch the food. Everyone seems to be playing too much in the back, talking loud and being very unprofessional. Coming here, I've met a few nice staff members so it doesn't apply to all of them. But them nasty ones gotta go!  I've noticed the staff is always changing, as much as I come here, I haven't seen the same staff more than once.  I love their pizza but I'm sure there's other locations that are just as good. I'm never coming back to this one. Save your gas and your money and find another location to save you all the drama."}
{"text":"Was told ten minutes for my deep dish pizza, I waited over thirty minutes.  People were getting their orders before me.  After waiting ten minutes I went in to pick up my pizza and a lady in front of me ordered a Hawaiian pizza she got hers ten minutes later.  No one would answer the phone, flies all over the place, that means they have a back door open, and I even heard somebody in the back say the f word.  Sloppy service, will not go back to this unit."}
{"text":"So it's little Caesars right...can't expect too much for $5.00 pizza and I don't.  However,  I do expect the employees to at least have moderate customer service and sanitation skills.  I was sitting there waiting 20 plus minutes for my pizza ( which they pretty much were to busy b.s'ing to make).I watched the only person really working, roll up the rug that's on the floor in the lobby, sweep up ..which is great . Then customers walk in, she calls for help which fell on deaf ears.  She then proceeds to wait on customers and touch every surface and order that goes out without washing her hands. Nasty, the fact I'd say there 20 mins and this girl was the only person really doing anything is why I didn't ask for a refund and leave. The other employees could give a rip that people were waiting or that this young lady was slammed. He They were more worried about getting their speaker than doing their job and full filling the orders. Oh and they touched a bunch of crap and didn't wash their hands either. Never again will I step foot in there... not trying to get a communicable disease from lack of hygiene."}
{"text":"Ordered online at 1 PM did not have it ready ONE HOUR LATER. Didnt have any sauce other than garlic butter. Ordered buffalo wings and they did not have sauce for wings. Gave me plain wings instead. Would give them 0 stars if i could."}
{"text":"NOT HOT OR READY Well the title says it all. I have given this location more than a fair share of opportunities. The last was the worst ever, waited for way too long and ended up leaving without any pizza. I ended up asking for a refund since they couldn't figure out how to run a proper business. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place has gone under new management in the past year or so, but the service now is so much better!!  The employees are great!  The wait time is significantly better too!"}
{"text":"Grab a $5 pizza to go when I'm not sure if I want to cook or not. I only had one instance to where they gave me a sausage pizza instead of a pepperoni. I now check to make sure I get the right pizza before leaving the parking lot."}
{"text":"Went in today for a quick pizza and there was a sign that said no card cash only so I had to run to the bank; then when I got back the money truck guy and cashier were talking the whole time and they gave all the costumers their pizza who came AFTER me, I was the first in but the last out! On top of that I asked for well done wings and they were still rubbery. Would give no stars if I could!!   All these reviews are right, only go here if you have time to wait nothing is ready."}
{"text":"No Hot-N-Ready ever. I have never been able to walk into this location and leave in under 15 minutes. I've even resorted to calling in my standard hot-n-ready order and they give my pizzas to other people who are always upset. Now I just make sure to get my order for free every time they give my order away, which has been 9/10 times. So call your order in and make sure to get your order for free if they give it away to someone else. Make note of your order time and the persons name who took the order by phone so you can talk with a manager."}
{"text":"Went to get our free Veterans Day lunch that was advertised, and this location does not support our Veterans.  I will remember that from now on. EXTREMELY rude Girl at the counter said I can give you a crazy bread but I need to see ID.  Well, Vets don't have ID's.. we are no longer in the military.  We did however bring our DD214 to show we were in the military and that was not good enough for her.  But since they aren't participating in the Free Lunch for Veterans, I am concluding that they don't support Vets.  Union Hills location participated with a smile so I guess I will go to that location from now on."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The lobby had at least 15 people waiting. Every teenage employee had an attitude and would laugh when someone would go to the register and ask why their order took so long. I ordered a large cheese pizza. Originally they said it would take 10 minutes. That was fair. 15 minutes later I went up to the only employee who looked worried about the lobby being full and asked him where my pizza was. He went back and checked and told me it was barely in the oven. He said it would still be a 5-8 minute wait from then. He kept going back and checking on my pizza. I did appreciate that. His good customer service did not make up for the lack of care of every other employee. They wore saggy pants and backward visors. Definitely would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times picking up a Hot N Ready pizza for friends that are helping me out around the house. I've never actually ate the pizza, but it usually looks fairly decent. The staff definitely needs training on customer service and just being professional. There's one middle aged woman there who's just loud and obnoxious. She's friendly, but doesn't really understand that you need to tone down your language and yelling while in front of the customer. Today she needed change and just stood there and screamed for it.   When I got home, I set the pizza out and as my friends got their slices, they were all laughing at it. One slice was 1/4 of the entire pizza! And there were several tiny thin slivers of slices. It was a mess. Although I don't expect measurements to be taken for perfect sized slices, maybe a basic lesson in geometry wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"If I could write the review on just the staff's friendliness, I would give them higher marks because they were very nice. There was a new girl on register and she was slow, but trying really hard. Another young man with some crazy blue hair was also very helpful and nice. However, that's the only good. I called in an order for 5 pizzas, nothing fancy, 4 pepperonis and 1 cheese, 3 orders of breadsticks. Called it in at noon, asked for it to be ready at 2. They said no problem. I got there at 1:53. There was a line plus people waiting. I didn't get my pizzas until 2:35, which made me late getting back to the school to give the kids their pizza party. They did offer me a free bag of breadsticks, which was nice, except the breadsticks were way over cooked and there was barely any Parmesan cheese on them. My students didn't even eat them. I don't know what happened, maybe understaffed, I don't know, but there were definitely  too many of us waiting."}
{"text":"I always thought that the sign twirling advertising near my neighborhood was desperate and wanted to avoid Little Caesars because of that.  However, I finally broke down because I had a mid evening craving and was driving by on 14th Street anyway.  Seriously, this is the fastest food service with the hottest food I've ever had.  I swear that the entire transaction took less than 3 minutes and that's because I used my debit card.  I ordered the $5 Hot N Ready Pepperoni pizza and it really is hot 'n ready.  Although basic, it was fresh and tasted good.  The purchase and consumption happened so fast that it's almost like it never happened; therefore, I was nearly guilt free!  I like to support mom and pop businesses but there are times that a perfect system like this is in order."}
{"text":"Hot and ready?!  HA. Every time I go here they tell me it will be 8 minutes before anything is ready. What a joke."}
{"text":"Wam-bam thank you ma'am! I love cheap pizza!  This is a new establishment right by the college, and thank goodness cause my cheap ass likes to eat all I can for the smallest dollar."}
{"text":"This is the best Little Caesars location I have been to! We have been here quite a few times on lazy Sundays when I don't feel like cooking and the pizza is always fresh and the establishment is new and clean. Definitely an easy $5 to drop!"}
{"text":"Food was actually fine and the service was polite and friendly.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Moved to this area about a year ago and have gone to this LC's off and on, since it's the closest to our house. We will now go out of our way to go to a different LC.  This one is generally run by teenagers, who neither care nor know what customer service is.   This one Never does their crazy bread right! Forgive me, but it is Supposed to have cheese actually On it correct? Barely ever has Any cheese and that's a year worth of observation."}
{"text":"I can grab a pizza & be in & out in less than 3 minutes. That counts for something! Maybe I'm going at less busy times but my pizza's always hot, ready & delicious! I've paid a lot more for pizzas that aren't as good. I was tempted to give it 5 stars....maybe I should...."}
{"text":"I would give this location zero stars. Very disappointed. I called ahead of time and asked for a fresh pepperoni deep dish pizza, what we usually get from Little Caesars. I was told there's already some made, I asked again if he could make a fresh one and said what time we would be there to pick up. The pizza I received was dry, burnt, and as if it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Very little sauce, just tasted like a big hunk of bread with a cheese stick on top. Please don't waste your time or money and go to another location."}
{"text":"I did a staycation recently. I ended up staying in Brampton for a three-day extended weekend.   I saw Dr. Strange at Cineplex Courtney Park in Mississauga during this weekend. Afterwards, I decided to grab some food and head back to my hotel in Brampton to eat. This Little Caesar's was on my way.   The store is in what seems to be a fairly new plaza. It wasn't too busy just after 4 pm.   The $11 Hot and Ready box set (deep! deep! pepperoni pizza with Italian cheesy bread) is back. It's my favourite! I ordered it and it was ready. I left in record time.   As always, the food is yummy. All that caramelization in the pizza is amazing. The Italian cheesy bread is so good.   I like this location. The person serving me was friendly and kind.   (224)"}
{"text":"I don't know why I come back the food is never hot and ready like they say I'll sit and wait for 20 mins for crap pizza that's not ready! I asked the lady why she didn't tell me before I paid for the pizza that it was going to be a wait. She said I have one hot and ready putting her hands up like we're going to get into it. Super unprofessional never going back ever!  Updating my review with the fact that I just got home and they didn't put the lid on that sauce to the crazy bread and sauce is all over my effing car. $20 pizza turned into $100 detail for my car."}
{"text":"**EDITED. 2 hours after I wrote this I was contacted by the Owner and a manager! They were very accommodating with WONDERFUL SERVICE! I added one more star!---------------------- -- I am very disappointed in the horrendous customer service I experienced by every employee I encountered during my visit. I called ahead and ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. The woman on the phone  kept asking me if I wanted pepperoni on my pizza and I said no thank you. She asked me a couple times but I declined and when I arrived there to pick up my pizza I told her I was picking up an extra cheese cheese pizza for my Grandmother. She said, \"do you mean the pepperoni pizza?\" and I replied, no I did not order pepperoni on my pizza. This employee told me that I did order pepperoni. She then told me that I specifically told her I wanted pepperoni on the pizza. I have never experienced anything like this before- I just told her again that I didn't and I would like a cheese pizza with extra cheese. It was although she was fighting me and told me that I ordered something that I didn't remember ordering. My grandmother doesn't eat pepperoni, and she's 91, so I know that I did not mention anything about pepperoni.  She said something about her phone being unclear or something, walked away from me, and then I guess the manager at the time walked up to me. Again, she said to me, \"I hear you are picking up a pepperoni pizza\" and I told her there must be a mistake and I ordered cheese pizza with extra cheese for my grandmother!\" She also argued with me to tell me that I had ordered pepperoni. I was thinking - how bizarre- because I never spoke to her before and why wouldn't she just want to rectify the situation. At the time I entered the store there were literally between 7-10 people in the little waiting area and a couple people outside. I know they were very busy and I wasn't mad about the mistake-I was just upset the way I was treated. It's like the two employees were telling me that I was wrong. I just told the manager that I would like them to please make me a cheese pizza with extra cheese and I will wait. She said it will be 10 minutes and I said no problem. I was pretty upset because nobody had apologized and instead I felt HUMILIATED in front of a ton of people like I don't know how to order a pizza or that I don't know what I ordered. I asked her what they can do for my inconvenience and she said they would give me free crazy bread. I said thank you. I had to ask for her to do something! It was beyond bizarre. So about 8 or so minutes later one of the many customers in the store told me that he sees my pizza.I went over to him and asked him how he knows that that pizza sitting on a counter in the back was my pizza. He then told me that he heard another employee say \"this is the extra cheese pizza\".He said that it had been sitting there for a minute and that's why he wanted to tell me. I was confused and thought it was very weird, but I hollered into the back area (bc nobody was in front at the counter at the time- also weird because of the amount of people), and a nice new employee brought it to me promptly. I told her that I heard this might be my pizza and she confirmed it. Then I told her that I was given free crazy bread. She asked me for my receipt. I was never given a receipt with my corrected order and I did ask my original person that was working with me that I spoke on the phone- about whether I needed a receipt and she said no. Also the manager said no. So when the woman who brought my pizza asked another employee up front (one who didn't know my story and was new to the situation) she said I need a receipt. I told her I was told by two employees I didn't need one. Then she just walked away and the manager came back. I checked my pizza and it felt colder than usual. I told her that I don't have my receipt because you said I don't need it, but you were going to give me crazy bread for the inconveniences.She grabbed the bread. I told her that I wanted her to know that a gentleman waiting told me about my pizza and how it had been sitting out for a minute. I told her that it was less than 10 minutes and I am ok with this, but I think it's weird that after everything it would be sitting there.Then she proceeded to tell me that it was not true and it was impossible that it was sitting out because she made it. I told her the gentleman saw it and told me and I saw it and had to call someone in the back to bring it to me. She said well that is HIS opinion that it was sitting out there, but that is NOT what happened. I told her why would he make this up, there are a ton of people in here. I told her \"You know what, I wouldn't be upset at all if you guys made a mistake, I had to wait a bit longer, if you just said you were sorry!\"I told her NOBODY during this entire encounter said SORRY! She looked at me weird and I told her I was going to write about this online"}
{"text":"Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait..."}
{"text":"Just like all previous reviews, takes way too long to get a pizza. I have never walked in and walked out with pizza. I would rather other from other places and wait 20 minute and go get my pizza than come here and wait 39 minutes for pizza.  They usually have enough staff to make pizza but, but the place is so poorly operated that it takes for ever to make pizza, pizza that they should have \"hot and ready\" I think it's time they rebrand their logo."}
{"text":"I was concerned and apprehensive to stop by given all of the recent poor reviews this particular location has received, but needed to grab some pizza quickly so I took a gamble. Friday nights would be expected to be busy with long lines, but there were two employees working the front with precision. Service was friendly, fast and accurate. I was in and out in under 4 minutes. Great job Little Caesars!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest, worst customer service Little Caesers. The one on 35th and Greenway is 100x better. I am sitting here, waiting for my pizza (they're never hot n ready as advertised) listening to 3 of the employees chat. One has a totally filthy mouth and won't stop cussing. I regret stopping here every single time."}
{"text":"Don't keep \"hot n ready\" pizzas ready. Second time I've gone in and they weren't available. Also don't have breadsticks readily available either. Lost my business tonight"}
{"text":"Little Caesars is a great value, I like the sauce and the pizza tastes decent. This location has a DRIVE THRU!! Talk about game changer. With the $5 hot and ready this makes perfect sense. Super convenient..."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Little Caesar's for a long time.  For $5, you cant go wrong, I like the pizza, the service is fast and friendly and they'll make it \"Crazy crust\" or cook it well done on request.  They sure makes it easy to feed a family of four."}
{"text":"I had bought some crazy bread . Not knowing they were burnt. They were really hard I couldn't bite them. I was more embarrassed to return them. Then they were to sell them like that. I strongly think they should pay attention to what they are cooking. I will not be buying crazy bread no more"}
{"text":"Had to wait for a supreme pizza to get made and baked which should be ready to go at around 5pm. Also they were out of wings. The cashier wasn't exactly full of zeal either.  What happened to customer service? Oh well...."}
{"text":"Can't beat Little Caesars for a go-to take out meal for the kids and I. Extramostbestest is legit! Consistency and quality at this location is hit or miss. Sometimes pizza is a 5* sometimes a 1 or 2*. Either way, perfect meal to satisfy hungry kids."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Little Ceasar's near me because I love their Italian cheesy bread! I called and a friendly voice picked up the phone. His name is Stephen. I asked to add pepperoni on the cheesy bread, but he asked the manager and they said they don't do that. Which was odd because every other location I have been to in California and Arizona has had that option. He did suggest getting a deep dish pizza with no sauce, but I decided just to get the deep dish pepperoni instead. He said it would be ready in 15 minutes and it was. The store is clean, the service was fast and friendly. The pizza was hot, the crust was buttery and flakey. I would recommend this location, but I hope they start offering the Italian cheesy bread with pepperoni like the other locations."}
{"text":"This Little Caesars is the worst. They rarely have cheese pizza ready to go. The one that is sitting there, the cheese is brown as if it is burn't. The last time I bought one from there and it looked like that it did taste burn't. The crust looks hard and when you ask if there are cheese's coming up the cashiers always look irritated as if they're the ones back there making it, saying it'll be 15 mins. for the next one. This place did a decent job in remodeling, now they need to upgrade their ovens and customer service. People want to see white melted cheese not brown cheese.  The kids they hire respond to you in slang and act as if they're doing you a favor being there. June 1st @ 8:15pm Some little kid working as a cashier gave me attitude when I asked for another cheese pizza because the one he showed me had of course, brown cheese and was all bubbled up. He stated \" Our Cheese Pizza's always look like this, they not burned. If you want another one you gotta wait 15mins.\" Get it together! Find out what oven or how they clean their ovens at the Little Caesars on Maryland Pkwy near Flamingo. They're always on point. If you're going to be a Little Caesars cashier or cook, be the BEST Little Caesars cashier or cook! I try and avoid going to the E. Charleston location but I was giving it another chance. I will never return again."}
{"text":"The food here is poorly crafted. When asked if there was a lunch special , the girl at the counter said there wasn't . Then the customer behind me ordered it. I was on my lunch it took forever . There wasn't barely any cheese in the pizza and the dough wasn't fully cooked."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could.  The kid who answered the phone did not listen at all after I repeated a simple order of 3 peperoni and 2 cheeses.  He kept repeating the wrong order and I kept correcting him,  My son ended up walking out of there paying for 6 pizzas and did have 6, but I again only ordered 5.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"WHY? Why must the Cosmic Trickster torment me so??? He must have wanted me to review this place, since he once again mucked with my life last week, forcing me to have one of their pies at a party. He's teaching me some sort of life lesson.   Little Caesars used to be pretty good for fast food pizza. They even offered a Sicilian pie! These days, LC is about where Dominos in the pecking order.   Hey, at least Dominos has admitted that they were making a pizza that tasted like heavy poster board slathered in Ragu and rubber. LC can't own up to that yet. They still want you to think that they're a hip, indy parlor that you should feel privileged to reside near since they make killer pies.   I mean, with all the other fine pizzerias in Dormont, LC is in the jungle, baaaaby. They're gonna diiiiieeeee!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually do not like Little Cesar's. The pizza is usually plain, dry and underwhelming. The crazy bread is usually bland and I never understand the hype...until today. The deep dish pizza and crazy bread where perfection. Seriously delicious. Whatever two people are working today, like right now,  kudos to them. They nailed it! Food is awesome and my coworkers agree."}
{"text":"This little Caesars serves cold food and if you pay extra to have them put more cheese on your breadsticks. They drown your bread with butter instead. When asking for extra cheese how do they confuse cheese with butter? They don't care to fix the problem either."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed here at this location. The staff is always really friendly and helpful!! They have some great options. If you haven't tried the deep dish now is the time.. brings little Caesars to the next level while you are a it try the Italian cheese bread... so so good!!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this Little Caesars. The pizza is always fresh and ready anytime I walk in the door. the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I love crazy bread, but this location always falls short in that aspect."}
{"text":"Slowest place ever. Terrible customer service. All the workers just sit there while one person works."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Ordered a deep dish and a hot and ready. They made our deep dish And forgot to cook our wings once it was ready. So our deep dish sat there for 20min as we had to wait another 10-15 for our wings. To top it off the employees laughed at the whole thing blaming each other. Not an apology or any kind of sympathy. I'll drive a little further next time for better customer service. Hopefully no cold pizza this time. They also forgot our sauces. Horrible experience and customer service"}
{"text":"this place is trash. Miguel is useless, along with the manager and 95% of the people who work there. besides the black lady working there who did everything, she was great. I waited probably 30-45 minutes for my pizza and cheese bread.  first they wouldn't break a $100 so I had to leave and break it then come back. When Miguel finally would take my money he had no idea what marinara sauce was. how do you work at a pizza restaurant and not know what that is? after I wait for 30-45 minutes I am so upset I'm just ready to leave, I get out to my car and they forgot the sauce. I explained what it was for 5 minutes and he still forgot!!  my boyfriend went back in to get it because I knew if I went in I would loose my shit. so when he went in the guy had absolutely no idea what had happened. he didn't remember us ordering the sauce or anything. he turned around and asked the nice black lady where it was then stood there and stared where she pointed for a few seconds, over filled the cup to where we couldn't even close it then gave it to my boyfriend with no napkin or anything.  I always come to this little caesars and this is the first time anything like this has happened. something needs to be done about those people asap."}
{"text":"I don't particularly understand why the super low ratings.  I wonder if there's been a staffing or management change recently?  Tuesday, I was craving pizza something fierce on my way home from work, and so my husband asked me to swing by Little Ceasars.    I walked in, and while they didn't have a Hot n Ready sausage...well...hot and ready, I placed an order and was told it would be about 6 minutes.  I also ordered crazy bread with extra cheese and butter topping.  About 6 minutes later, I had my pizza and crazy bread, and was heading home.  The food was good.  Its pretty standard for a chain like this, but they used a lot of sausage, and the crazy bread was great.  Service itself was polite, but I was a little miffed that I got all the way home only to discover that the young lady who helped me had NOT put a marinara sauce in the bag or box for the crazy bread.  That was upsetting, and honestly, the only reason for 3 stars instead of 4.    I'll be back again, for sure.   For cheap pizza, its a no brainer!"}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews for this location...I've always had a good experience with this Little Caesars.  Whether we're picking up a Hot and Ready pizza, or calling in a custom pizza order, we've never had to wait much longer than 5 minutes.    Service is always really polite and fast, and the location is super clean.  As far as the pizza goes...its not complicated, gourmet pizza, but it is tasty, and the last few times I've had it, its tasted better than some of the other more popular chains.   Good work, guys!  Keep it up, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm the type of girl that really just loves food of all kinds. I can eat (and appreciate!) Joel Robuchon & Alex one day and be content to eat Little Caesars the next. I honestly think the $5 (ALWAYS hot and ready) pizzas are an insane value.   They are pretty damn tasty, easy for me to pick up on a whim, and service is always great too. For $2.75 or so I can add on a crazy pack of tasty crazy bread + sauce. For $7.75 I have tasty food to feed the husband and I for 2 days! This is one of those cases where you do NOT get what you pay for. This pizza transcends its' $5 price tag. No, it's not Settebello, but sometimes when you want cheap food RIGHT NOW this is the perfect fix.   PS - I think this place is infinitely better than Sbarro/Villa Pizza and those sorts of places."}
{"text":"The service was great today at this location . I ordered four pizzas and cheese bread to take to a friends house for super bowl. I pre ordered it three hours in advance, and they still had it fresh and hot on time like I ordered. There were definitely on point . Five stars 's all the way ."}
{"text":"Another Little Caesar's and another bad experience.  The employee was chomping gum and had this hat in upside down and sideways.  Since when is this ok in any business?  Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! Reminds me of high school days:) I would walk to little ceasars on my lunch break. We would combine our change which would buy us a generous amount of food. Then we would walk back to class stuffed and ready to nap! Yum yum"}
{"text":"This is the worst little cesars place i have ever been too. It'll do for the kids though. Staff is friendly but the pizza tastes wierd."}
{"text":"Never never never have they had pizza or crazy bread hot and ready when I have gone in there. Then they tell you 5 min and it is always longer!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an $8 pizza that is READY RIGHT NOW, this is your place. I've never had to wait on a Supreme, even if there is a bunch of people waiting on pizzas. Apparently they often get behind on Pepperonis for $5, and custom orders always seem to have people waiting for them.  This is NOT as good as Sardella's across the street - but it's an $8 pizza ready to go."}
{"text":"Corporate needs to seriously consider retraining or replacing the workers. I watched a father request for only half his pizza be covered with pepperoni and the man behind the counter gave him a hard time and wanted to upcharged him. Why upcharge for using less ingredients? Why is it some restaurants comply and listen to their customers and others simply do not? The father said he would pay for pepperoni and worker was rude about it. Very bad customer service, no wonder your rating is so low. Never again. Im tired of giving Little Caesars a chance, there are other options. I do not like seeing people mistreated for simple requests."}
{"text":"Hubby HAD to have Little Caesars on Christmas Eve. I do not like the pizza here, and it's never hot, nor ready. I had my hubby get me crazy bread. Thank you ever so much for the food poisoning on Christmas Eve. This store has to be disgustingly FILTHY in the food prep area to cross contaminate bread. Never again. I'd rather pay $40 for a pizza at Grimaldi's that eat this swill again."}
{"text":"This place got no proper customer service. I called ahead of time to order pizza at 4:45pm the lady that answered said if I can wait i said yes. Waited till 5:07pm then she hang up on me. Wow thanks not ever coming here."}
{"text":"I have walked in the peanut gallery... the girl with the curly hair that handles as the cashier, nice girl, but walks out from the back with a full mouth of food chewing greeting me and gulping down her soda every other breath as she's taking my order, screams Bloody Mary every chance she gets going in the back. I get it's loud but have some common curtesy for guests that are purchasing. She also helped make several pizzas while I'm here including mine. I highly doubt she washed her hands after I handed my money to her. I doubt I am coming back in here again."}
{"text":"During Sunday Night Football, I shimmied on over to Little Caesars during half-time. Surprise, surprise, the line was out the door. I didn't mind though because I was expecting to walk into a madhouse. The line whittled down pretty quickly and I ordered my $5 hot-n-ready cheese pizza. The cashier was friendly and told me she was sorry but there would be a wait for my pizza. No worries! I swooped up an empty seat and 5 minutes later, BAM, my pizza was ready. You could say that since I had to wait, my pizza technically was not \"hot and ready\" as advertised. The upside was that my pizza was super fresh and hot right out of the oven.    Yeah Little Caesars doesn't have the best pizza, but for $5 for a large pizza, there's really no room to complain. To boot, this Little Caesars has a great location. It's right next to a Baskin Robbins and a Starbucks across from the Smith's shopping center on Ann and Camino El Norte."}
{"text":"Did you know there's something called Crazy Crust that you add on to your hot 'n ready pizza for $1? Neither did I. For an extra dollar, you can pimp your crust out by having butter, Parmesan, garlic, etc. slathered on it. I have to say, it does make the crust taste better!   I came to pick up a couple of pizzas on a Thursday around 4PM. The place was slammed and there was only one employee working the registers. It was loud and hectic inside, and she was yelling out orders like a seasoned pro. I was probably in and out within 3 minutes.  2 Hot 'n ready pizzas with crazy crust and a cold 2 liter cost just under $16. I had to ask for my receipt. Is it normal to not get a receipt at Little Caesars?  This Little Ceasar's Pizza location is located across from Starbucks in a shopping center on the corner of MLK and Cheyenne.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #34"}
{"text":"Okay, I know Little Caesars is not an authentic Italian pizza, but truth be told, no pizza chain is. This Little Caesars pretty consistently makes the best $5 cheese pizzas and Crazy bread. The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and it's never over cooked. I'm very particular on how  the appearance and taste of the Crazy Bread too. I like it soft and spongy, hot, buttery, and seasoned evenly. They nail it every single time! Lastly, the employees are very courteous and respectful."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Placed phone order and they didn't have it in the system. Placed order again at register and they gave it to later customers. No refund offered."}
{"text":"This is the best Little Caesar's I have ever been in my whole life. The staff is always friendly.I suggest getting the crazy bread style crust. You will think me for that later.I only wish it was closer to my place tho but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I wanted to write this review to let everyone in a little secret about Little Caesars.  They keep a few hot pepperoni pizzas in a heated refrigerator at all times.  And the best part is, they only cost $5.00 each!  So you can walk in and say, \"Gimme two hot pepperoni pizzas!\" and you're out in about 1 minute.  That's faster than any pizza joint I've ever heard of.    Their pizza isn't spectacular tasting, but it's good and it's fast.  Oh, this is a newer location on Pearl & Brookpark in the Pearlbrook Plaza."}
{"text":"Walkin special and crazy bread are always a great combo for any event  or night in      but...    I was kind of disappointed in the size of the actual pizza in the new box set deep dish pizza with garlic bread on the up side it looks and smells yummy  as usual"}
{"text":"Pizza was good management sucks.  Double charged for pizza gave paperwork showing double charge and manager doesn't even have decency to try to make right.  Won't be coming back to this location"}
{"text":"Chaotic and disorganized.... before coming to this location I also noticed a rather large crowd in the shop, now I know why.  Unfortunately this shop does not have \"hot n ready\" pizzas! I mean, that's my main motivation for even going to a little caesars...  Upon walking into the cramped store space there is no indication as to where to order and where to pick.  As a result you are left to decipher who amongst the crowd of hangry patrons who has ordered and who has not.   Staff is young and unexperienced... also hand hygiene and professional conduct are sorely lacking."}
{"text":"Got the bacon crust pizza was hot and ready upon pick up. Ordered a regular pepperoni a couple days later and again they delivered as promised."}
{"text":"If I could leave this place no stars I would. I will never go back to this location. I was there for 30 minutes waiting for bread sticks and a hot and ready. The cashier didn't have any idea what she was doing and the manager was rude. Don't come here if you don't have to!"}
{"text":"My husband and I don't make much money. We come here sometimes because its cheap. The only thing I have to say and its not an issue, but you guys totally suck at cutting pizza slices haha! Also, don't go to the one on McDowell. I swear when I got pizza from there, there was blades of grass on it, gross."}
{"text":"Such a bad location. If I can't give no stars I would. Place an order over the phone for pick up and had to repeat myself several times. My order was simple. 1 pep light sauce and 1 sausage light sauce. Guy taking the order didn't understand and kept insisting I wanted both toppings on each pizza. Arrived to pick up my order and no one greeted me. The guy that finally helped me was not friendly. The pizza was too dry. Yes, light sauce not no sauce. Smh"}
{"text":"Came here this evening and the placed was packed. I've never seen a little Caesar this packed. It was so packed it almost made you think twice about going in. I did a special order and to my surprise we got our food in 10 mins. The staff was friendly and efficient.   Only down fall was I ordered our pizzas light sauce and 2/3 was not light sauce."}
{"text":"Hot and ready must no longer be a thing. With cheap prices i expect some crap but to be quoted 15-20 minutes and wait over 30 for 2 pizzas is absolutely ridiculous. Nothing was even give to apologize NOT EVEN A THANK YOU FOR WAITING. Get new management and employees and maybe i'll be back."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!! I ordered online an hour before arrival. 3 hot n READY pizzas, bread sticks & Chicken wings. But here I am waiting with a room full of 18 people who have also not received their food! On top of having to wait for something that is claimed to be \"HOT N READY\" , I'm appalled by the rude service!!!! PLEASE WORK ON YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS. And please have your employees focus on the urgency of your customers. ESPECIALLY IN THIS HOT WEATHER!"}
{"text":"I love their food and service. They are always ready with my call IU orders and they are consistent with the food. For the price and easy accessibility to pizza, the beat. I'm a personal liver of the deep dish pepperoni pizza and always order. Can't beat the price and food."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in drive thru going on 32 mins with only 2 cars in front of me. Saw 7 people walk in and come out within 5 mins of going in. Why have a drive thru if you're going to act like it's not there? Utterly ridiculous for a company whose primary appeal is speed. I could have ordered Barros instead."}
{"text":"I normally pick this pizza up about once a month if I'm in a rush, as it's very convenient and good value for the money.  This past week I had a disappointing experience and tried to resolve it within the store, to no avail. The cheese pizza actually had very little cheese on it, and I brought it back in to show the kitchen - who argued that 'there was plenty of cheese on it'.... you could see pure red areas where it was clearly 'only sauce', and a few areas where there was a bit of cheese.  Instead of replacing it for me with one from the warming cupboard, I was told I could wait 15-20 minutes for them to make me a new one.  As a regular customer, this didn't seem like a reasonable solution, since they had other pizzas just sitting there.  I was very polite about it and left with my cheese-less pizza, and fixed it when I got home.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Does not even deserve a star.  My boyfriend and I got sooooo sick from this pizza last night.  We both had to call off work.  We had leftover pizza and it smelled horrible already this morning.  Should never get sick from cheese pizza"}
{"text":"I normally order over the phone but today I just drop in. As I'm standing there two young ladies who was at the register notice I was standing there and walk around the corner. Laughing and joking around the young lady went back to work while the other one playing in her hair goes over to where the young lady is making the pizza reach other and grab something out the container and put it in her mouth using the same hand she just had in her mouth. The manager said she would speak to her personal but the manager look no more than 16. Either go else where for pizza or watch them while making it. Just very nasty and very upset."}
{"text":"Used the app to order, never got an email or notification when my food was ready. After 45 minutes I went inside to ask, and they just pull it out of the oven and that's it. No apology, no explanation, no thanks. It was Friday night, and dinner prime time, so I understand the lag, but not 45 minutes without a notification."}
{"text":"Average hand tossed pizza, but their Detroit style pan pizza if very good. I grew up with Little Caesars in Detroit, and have always liked it. Cheep pizza that is great when you have 10 kids to feed. Little Caesars is like White Castle, you love it if you grew up with it."}
{"text":"So sad this place is going down with their service it used to be good and better customer service I  just went today and order three pizzas 40 minutes later I have to ask to see were where my pizzas and the cashier SONJA R With that attitude told me oh they forgot to make your order you going to have to wait 15 more minutes or do you want your cashback honestly you guys have to get it together at least apologize for your bad service.."}
{"text":"Food is usually decent tasting. There are never pizzas ready here. This location should not advertise hot and ready. You will be sitting here for 10-20 minutes for sure. This can be said for most little Caesars now though. They sure do suck. The people here aren't very professional. I have seen people standing in the store for 5+ minutes and nobody even acknowledging they are there. Never again will I come here. I just can't. Save yourself the trouble and spend the extra money on delivery."}
{"text":"Updating my one star review 4 star review.   Had some bad experiences here before but lately they have been good.   The only thing I would change is they should have someone at both registers when the lobby is full.   And the second if you are one of those douche bags that thinks he can walk in and cut everybody in line and act like you are top shit, you can go fuck yourself.   All the poor girl did was offer you crazy bread and you give her a smug ass look and walk away without saying a word be a gentleman and not a fucking douche bag.    #pizza was bomb as fuck"}
{"text":"You know what you are getting. Come on, this isn't the best pizza in town, but close enough to many homes in the Southern Ave and 19Th avenue basin."}
{"text":"The manager here is an absolute piece of crap. He talks to the 16 year old kids there like they are worthless. Multiple customers were angry the way he was talking to his employees. He needs to be fired immediately. I hope corporate sees this."}
{"text":"Hot and NOT ready. 15 mins and the guy in front of me walked out because it took so long. Scam"}
{"text":"Literally the worst managed Little Caesars franchise in Vegas. 10 people in line during dinner rush on a weekday. 3 employees running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. Orders were yelled out for customers who didn't exist. Meanwhile people were handed pizza boxes with the wrong contents. Every customer was told that there would be a 17-minute wait, but that level of odd specificity was never met and a lot of potential customers walked out. The cashier boy did hang out free cookies to everyone after my coaxing. But after the cookies were gone we were still pissed about the wait that never ended."}
{"text":"Cold, Extra Greasy, and burnt.  Picked up a $5.00 Pep and tried two pieces. I threw the rest in the trash.  The pizza was burnt. The pizza was cold. The amount of grease on the bottom of the box was so soaked through my counter at home had to be washed off. It sat on the counter for 2 mins and looked like I washed the counter with grease.  I do understand this is the McDonalds of pizza, but when its not even edible, whats the points?  If this place went out of business, the world would be better off.."}
{"text":"Shocking but the pizza here is awesome and the wings are really yummy. The garlic Parmesan wings are sinful. I don't eat here anymore cause I'm on a health kick but if ever I decided to have a pizza / wing cheat meal this is where I'd go. Not to mention the prices are insanely cheap!!!  Update: they recently removed the garlic Parmesan wings. Huge fail!!! Bring those bad boys back!!!"}
{"text":"I had to throw the pizza away it tasted so bad."}
{"text":"Someone needs to go baby sit at this location! Called in my order at 4:30 pm went to pick it up at 5 pm, and only one girl at the counter ?! While 3 large young men stayed back screwing around and laughing at the girl ?! They did not step up to help as customers became angry with the counter girl! Plus they were the ones who took the phone orders and screwed them all up ! When I called the phone rang so long I called back twice! Hello I hope none of these guys is the store manager? If so fire them and give the job to the counter girl!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be generous and give 3 stars. So we get there and the dude that checked us out was the ABSOLUTE worst. He just confused us more. So my brother ordered the pizza and then I ordered the cheesy bread. Then we get our food back and it was crazy bread. Like what the actual hell. So then I told them that's not what I ordered and so then she STILL charged me the difference in price because apparently he rang it up as a crazy bread. At least she was nice but then it took 12 minutes for the bread to be done. Smh. They need to hire some new people."}
{"text":"Now you don't go into LC's for amazing pizza, you go in for cheap, hit and ready pizza. The problem with this location is the whole hot and ready piece. I visit this location at least twice a month and never and I mean never do they have pizza that they advertise as hot and ready, ready. I usually have to wait about 15 minutes for a basic cheese pizza. Customer service is usually okay. The location on Rural and Ray is much more prepared and obviously better managed because I have never had an instance where waiting 15 mins was even a request."}
{"text":"Customer service on the phone when ordering horrible you order something that is on their online menu for the Streetsboro location you get a nasty response from the order-taker saying we don't have a deluxe what's on a deluxe you'll have to pay for everything separately would not let me even speak extremely rude which is surprising because if you just stopped in to get lunch they're always very nice if she doesn't like to work there on a weekend maybe she should get another job"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the customer service is consistently horrible! The people on the phone taking special orders are rude and I've showed up on several occasions after being told my pizza would be ready in 10 minutes to have to wait around another 10 cause they didn't start making it.  Incompetent is a pretty good adjective for the people who work here."}
{"text":"I have yet to be come to this location, after a dozen times, where they don't have a line out the door due to being understaffed and not having pizzas ready to go. They are incredibly disorganized and the customer service is severely lacking in every regard.  There are never any 3 meat or supreme \"hot & ready\" pizzas. Anyone ever heard of false advertising? You see the commercials, they get you in the door, and then you're left standing around for your pizza that was supposed to be \"hot & ready\"."}
{"text":"No Supreme, hot or ready. Little Caesars needs to get it's stuff together. Seriously disappointing customer service at almost every location we've tried, including this one."}
{"text":"Low on cash, come here for dinner! can't beat $5 ready pizzas, better than Costco pizza. They also have a deep dish pizza for $8. Drinks are a bit pricey so grab some 32 ozs from QT before heading here, lol.  Parking in front it okay, just hope you don't get there during primo dinner or lunch rush or you might have to wait for them to bake your pizza which isn't half bad because you'll get a fresh one rather than one that's been sitting in a warmer. Yay! :)"}
{"text":"Location; Peoria and 43rd Ave, right next to Next Care Urgent care.  Food; The pizza is usually hot and fresh, sometimes its cooked to order meaning its right out of the oven.    Service;  The cashiers are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Hot n ready pizza is never hot and ready every time I come here on any day is a 10-25min wait on a single pizza worst spot to have"}
{"text":"lol ordered supreme pizzas and that's 4$ extra, got CHEESE PIZZA. girl at the register was so unapologetic like whatever won't come back"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to get pizza quickly and easily, this isn't it.  I stopped in earlier and ordered 5 pizzas and some crazy bread, all from their \"Hot and Ready\" menu.  I don't mind waiting a little when something isn't ready, it means that it's fresh and they're busy but 18 minutes after I ordered the cashier listed my entire order as available to the 8th or 9th customer behind me in line.  When I asked why my order wasn't ready when it was all in their core (twice), he told me that he didn't know.  I asked for manager who didn't seem to understand that someone could be upset that the pizzas they had been waiting for were walking out the door to people who came in after their order.  When I asked for a refund he muttered something about the owner and vanished into the back.  That's when my favorite part happened, a lady (presumably the owner) came out and asked what the problem was.  When I related, once again, to her that my entire order was sitting in the warming ovens being listed off to newcomers and I didn't understand why I was still waiting.  She tried to say that she'd check on it.  When I asked for a refund instead, my order suddenly appeared (as if by magic).  When I asked why I had been waiting she offered me a 2-liter of soda and a bit later a pizza.  I didn't take either, I would have much rather had an apology that I never got.  What I got instead was called \"miserable\", I can only assume because I had the audacity to complain.  I will say that the pizza here does not live up to the \"ready\" part and customer service appears to be nonexistent.  If I'm going to have to wait nearly 20 minutes anyways I'd rather have food from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns."}
{"text":"Why do I bother to go there? They NEVER have any hot and ready,    hot OR ready! But they do have plenty of excuses. This is the worse run Cesears in this valley.  After several tries, I think I finally learned my lesson. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered our food ahead of time, we were told it was going to be ready in 20 minutes... turns out it was like an hour wait and our Crazy Bread was burnt"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars but I can't. There's a girl here who just talks to one of her friends who aren't even an employee here. She's a stubby girl who kept looking at me werid. Second after ordering she told me an 8 minute wait. 25 minutes later my pizza and cheesy bread sit on the counter while she talks to her friends who again don't work there while my pizza gets cold. At first I didn't know it was my pizza but after they gave it to me I was pissed because I would have taken my food. This place has to many young workers that sit and joke whole people watch them as they wait in line."}
{"text":"A pizza place with a drive-thru?!  That's correct. I'm not really sure how this works but it does. It must be their \"hot-n-ready\" specials that keep the cars moving through.  The service here has always been fast and friendly. I've never waited more than a minute or two before I'm up to grab my cardboard box of carbs. The Deep Deep Dish pizza is pretty good. Its one of their pre-made options that comes topped only with pepperoni. The crust is nice and crunchy on the outside and not ridiculously thick like you sometimes get with deep dish pizza.  Also, you can never go wrong with Crazy Bread. Never."}
{"text":"The night shift Manager, Mr.Hernandez is a great manager! He greeted me upon arrive and treated with with so much respect. You can tell he has a lot of management skills. Definitely had a great experience because of this guy! I will be coming back"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a lower star than this just picked up a pizza which took more than the allotted time that she told me it was going to take for a hot and ready. not only did they take long but when my order was ready they said that the order is ready to go out and the lady who is giving the orders out was in the back eating pizza and then comes to the front drinks water stairs at everybody and then proceeds to hand out orders five minutes after they were told to go out"}
{"text":"I called my order in at 11am!  I ordered two pepperoni, two cheese, and One Pineapple Pizza not a Hawaiian pizza! They said on the phone that my order would be ready at 1120! Great because my sons party was starting at one and I still needed to drive across town! I go in at 1115 to pay and he said your order almost ready.  Well apparently the lady making the pizzas didn't notice that i paid for A PINEAPPLE PIZZA! Then decided to lie and tell me the order just popped up! Four of my pizzas are done!  I paid for the whole order! It was $30! The pizza was wrong! I'm not sure why  she lied and why she was rude! I explained i needed to leave bc my sons birthday would starting soon and just give me another pizza but the kid said just ask for a refund but the lady wouldn't refund my money or give me another pizza! I didn't even want the refund, i wanted the pizza!!! I was so upset bc we were late and she was rude! I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"No customer service at all, ridiculous wait times, never any hot & ready pizzas.. but if you want burnt crazy bread... this is your spot. In need of new management AND employees."}
{"text":"Sometimes I don't have time to order a pizza and wait, I may be starving and want one right away. Every time I have been here they NEVER have any pizzas ready and sometimes a line of people waiting. Decent pizza but definitely not quick"}
{"text":"I am probably in the minority here, but I'm not really that big a fan of pizza. And I KNOW I'm in the super minority who counts Little Caesars as a favorite when I do want pizza. I happen to think it's delicious!  $5 pizza without a wait? That's awesome!   Sometimes I buy two pizzas.  \"So then I get the other pizza, put it in the freezer, so I can always have an on-hold Caesar.\" - CheeZ-E"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just this location. But I absolutely hate coming to pick up pizza at little Caesars. Always crowded, sassy cashiers, employees screaming and dealing with personal problems infront of customers, ALWAYS waiting 20-30 mins for pizza. Cheap price comes with the awful experience. Pizza itself is fine though."}
{"text":"Got home to an uncut pizza. You had 1 job. Cmon now, i know it's just little caesars but y'all could've at least cut my pizza into slices. Absolutely trash."}
{"text":"I wanted some pizza, and had only a little bit of cash.  Where to go?  Yup, Little Caesars.   I had seen some reviews on Youtube and other places of their deep dish pizza.  I had never had it before (always go with the $5.00 hot and ready pepperoni) and it sounded pretty tasty.  I drove down here, walked inside, and saw that they had a \"Hot-N-Ready Box Set\" for $8.00.  This included 4 pieces of deep dish pepperoni pizza, and about 8 slices of Italian cheese bread.  They didn't have any of these already available, but the lady said that it would be only 8 minutes or so.  Me and my son took a seat and waited for our pizza.  While waiting, one of the employees started chatting us up about Halloween.  She asked us what we were doing for it etc.  She was very nice and made the wait for our pizza enjoyable.  She also gave my son Bill some cookies.  I stole one from Bill, and they were actually pretty good (thin, crispy, shortbread style cookies)!  About 10 minutes later, our pizza was ready.  I took the box out to the car, popped the trunk of our CRV and sat down to dig in.  Here is how it was................  Pepperoni Deep Dish-  I dug into this side of the box first.  You get 4 large slices of deep dish pepperoni pizza.  This thing was piping hot since it was just made 2 minutes before.  I had to let it cool down for a bit and then dug in.  First bite in, I was pretty impressed!  The edges were nice and crisp, the cheese was melted perfectly and the pepperonis were cooked the way I like them, too.  These slices of pizza were thick!  I could only finish 2 of them, and decided to save the rest for later.  The slices kind of reminded me of old school Pizza Hut Pan Pizza.  Lots of oil in the pan to crisp up the bottom/edges, and honestly, it tasted great.  It was better than their $5.00 regular thin crust pizzas.  The deep dish is the way to go!  Italian Cheese Bread-  This \"other half\" of the box was 8 slices of cheese bread!  This was very good!  No sauce (sauce on the side..didn't even try it), tons of cheese and garlic/onion/butter spices all laid upon the same deep dish base as the pizza.  I loved the crusty, crispy edges and bottom of this!  The flavors worked and I enjoyed this almost as much as the pizza.  I ate 4 slices and saved the rest for later.  Overall, I was very happy with my meal.  I am a pizza snob, but I can still appreciate something like this.  For $8.00, you get a HUGE box full of stuff.  I made 2 full meals (could have probably made 3) from this box and for the value, it cannot be beat!  I have had pizzas that were 2-3 times this price that weren't nearly as good.  Is it winning any James Beard, or \"Best of Yelp\" awards?  No.  Is it extremely tasty for less than $10.00?  Hell to the yes!  I liked it a lot more than I thought I would, and when I come back, I will definitely get some more deep dish goodness!"}
{"text":"Went to place an order, was told 45 minutes.  Manager hooked me up with a quick special order knowing I couldn't wait."}
{"text":"For $5.99, you can't get any better. I used to eat this almost daily and I almost died."}
{"text":"I think there should be a ZERO STAR OPTION!  This location only employs idiots... EVERY TIME I come here they F**k up my order!  I call ahead every time because I order specialty pizza ... Plus its supposed to be fresh if it's custom...I don't understand how you can screw up. A simple pizza order.  Tonight I called ahead and when I arrived 10 minutes later (after she took my name and number over the phone) she claims to not have a phone order and tried to say I must have called the wrong location....when I PROVED to her I called this location she repeated my order to me... If she didn't have a,y pho e orders how did she know what I ordered... ??? Completely incomptitent!  And the manager was as worthless as tits on a boar... All of them...need some customer service skills and training on how to do their job and take an order...if only this was the first time... It seems to be a continuous problem for this location."}
{"text":"Is this the best pizza I've ever eaten?  No, but they are reliable and have my orders ready on time. I work across the street at Chandler-Gilbert Community College, and we use them quite a bit for events with students. The prices are right when trying to stay within budget, and customer service has always been nice. I think the breadsticks are pretty good.    Service and reliability for my orders for events - four stars.  That is really important when you're feeding a bunch of students and staff for a meeting!"}
{"text":"Please I urge you to rethink stopping here yo pick up a pizza. The workers do not  wear gloves or hair belts to protect from germs and bacteria. I watched a worker come from the bathroom not wash their hands and start making pepperoni pizza with no gloves. Then I watch the person cutting my pizza. YES... My PIZZA took his bare hands and picked out a piece of food that did not belong out my pizza and proceeded to cut my pizza and hand me the box immediately after seeing this I requested a refund.  The manager did not say anything and handed me my money not even an apology or have her employees put on gloves, none of the above happened.   Food safety is a must this could get people sick , on the hospital and little ceasar at this location does not care to safely provide you bacteria free food."}
{"text":"The debit card machine is broke AND they don't have any change in the cash register. So if you don't have exact change you're screwed. On a Saturday afternoon what kind of business operates like this. The girl at the register is overworked and no one is helping her. The phone is ringing, line out the door and her coworkers are moving at a snails pace. They suck!!!!"}
{"text":"It was horrible service. They hung up on me three times and wouldn't pay us any mind. Definitely gonna try to never come back."}
{"text":"Little Cesar's is a perfectly good option for your quick pizza options. The deep dish pizza was better than I was expecting. Specials are hard to pass up and the staff was friendly. I ordered pizzas not on the specials list so we had to wait for our pizzas, which is expected of course. The biggest concern was the amount of confusions that seemed to create. We had to repeat out order at least 4 times to two different people. Seems like they could've written it down or created a ticket for it. Then when the pizza was ready they didn't know what pizzas we had ordered which made confirming confusing. They made the right ones, they just made it confusing, haha. The pretzel pizza was a little too salty for me, but then again I always get unsalted pretzels so I probably should've saw that coming. All in all we were pleased with our food and will  go back again n dr time we want some yummy pizza, quick and cheap."}
{"text":"There is a REASON WHY the pizzas here are $5.  All it takes is one bite.    But I kinda agree with the other review.  This would be a great meal if I were homeless."}
{"text":"Went in for pizza and cheesy bread. Waited over 30 minutes for my food and the whole time no one told me what was going on. When I finally got.my food the pizza wasn't fresh and they never apologized for the wait or thanked me."}
{"text":"False advertising on the hot n ready, order a pizza and waited almost 35min for it, its better to just order a pizza from pizza hut that's on  Pilot gas station on craig and Pecos about 3min from here."}
{"text":"Third time was not a charm at this location. Caesar needs to get his act together and focus on how to improve this Hot n Ready concept. As usual, when ordering a deep dish I got the response, \"we ran out of dough\". How does this happen on multiple occasion? SMH.  So Caesar, please just discontinue this Hot n Ready concept because you can't fulfill it's requirements."}
{"text":"1 star for cheap pizza only.  No customer service skills, no communication amongst workers, poor work ethics, no patience, they seem to be frustrated when busy, unorganized, chaotic, the pizza is worse and worse each time I go back, I could go on but not going to.  Not going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of little Cesar's. For the price not bad. This location has been pretty consistent and customer service is good."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hot n Ready Pepperoni Pizza.  It was not very good;  the pizza seemed to have been sitting in the warming oven for quite a while since the pizza was only lukewarm.  It wasn't piping hot like the ones we are usually used to getting in Henderson NV.  Service was very nice."}
{"text":"Little Caesars is cool but this one is not the best, quick question?? How do you have like 20 workers and still have to wait 15 minuets for a pizza ??   -Shaking my Head-"}
{"text":"What can I say! You can't beat the $5 pepperoni pizza hot and ready price especially if your on a budget... Great location and always busy.... Don't get caught in the rush... Lol pizza night for everyone! Pizzas roll out really fast here.... No complaints here! Fast and easy for the days you don't feel like cooking...."}
{"text":"This location is the worst...they never have the hot and ready pizzas ready and say there will be a 25-30 minute wait for them to. So I order ahead and they say it'll be ready in 5-10 minutes and it still takes 25 minutes to be ready."}
{"text":"Wonder what happened at this location to make it close two hours early , I walk in and they say \" I can't take your there's glass on the floor!\" I was like ok and turned around and walked out , it was a weird scene in there. Wish I could've got pizza"}
{"text":"Little Caesar's is like Steven Seagal; better in the 80's and 90's. I loved any kind of pizza as a kid. Little Caesar's had the pizza pizza, square box. This was when it was down by Szechuan Garden. Then, they disappeared for almost 15 years. It was better as a memory. Crazy Bread is still really good because it reminds me lunch time at school. If I had Shark Bites and a little chocolate milk, I almost would trick my mind into the simpler times. Hot-N-Ready, $5!"}
{"text":"Not bad for chain pizza. I've only ever gotten the pan pizza. Sicilian style, crispy, caramelized edges, good sauce and pretty good cold for breakfast the next morning. Take out only."}
{"text":"Store \"manager\" Nicole needs some serious educating on her customer service & managerial skills. I stopped in on a Friday morning for some crazy bread & a $5 pizza & asked for a bunch of napkins. I got 3 flimsy napkins so I asked for more. She gave me 6 more & said she needed to make sure there were enough for the weekend. I said I was feeding a class full of kids and needed more napkins and she said you only bought one pizza I need napkins for the weekend. So I said maybe you should talk to someone about ordering the napkins not to give me her attitude. She gave me a few more and began to yell at me in front of three other customers that I only ordered one pizza and she needed more napkins for the weekend. I started to leave but walked to the side of the counter just so I could see how many napkins they really had. If she had bothered to eat any of the crazy bread she would know that it is extremely greasy and covered in cheese, requiring the use of more than one napkin per person. She then proceeded to scream at me that she wasn't going to let me come back to HER store. I've been to many other little Caesars in the valley and when I order only a crazy bread I am given a nice supply of napkins without the trouble. I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible. Manager isn't very friendly or helpful and employees are likely high school or college students that just need the money for a ramen grocery trip. They don't care about doing their jobs very efficiently and this location never seems to even attempt to plan ahead for busy times or try to speed up their production at all when the lobby is flooded with customers.   I'm writing this while sitting here after being told it was a 15 minute wait and it's now been 35. Had I not already paid for my ONE HOT AND READY PIZZA for my pregnant wife at home, I'd walk out.   The only saving grace is that their pizzas are usually baked well and taste better than the other location I normally stop at on my way home from work.   Some things need to be fixed here, but if you've got time and don't mind poor service, stop by this location."}
{"text":"What's there not to love about a 5 dollar pizza made ready for pick up? Mind you, this review is based soley off the hot and ready pizzas, along with their crazy bread.  I must admit I've never ordered their chicken wings, deep dish pizza, etc. I like that there's a lot of parking at this location, they open at 10:30am and the employees here are always very cheerful an seem to enjoy their jobs. The crazy bread.... Oh the crazy bread! This is the best type of breadstick I have vet had. They are so soft and covered in buttery deliciousness. I can't resist picking up a bag of these things each time I come in. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because the \"hot and READY\" pizzas sometimes aren't ready when you order them."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza for the price. Have always relieved good service from this location."}
{"text":"They should have no stars at this place the customer service here is horrible you stand in line and wait for one pizza and don't even get it until 30 minutes after you order it I hate this location and I will continue to go to the one on  Sahara and Nellis"}
{"text":"My kids and I were eating pizza when my husband started coughing because he chocked on a strand of hair that was mixed in with the sauce. Not 2 minutes later did my daughter find another strand of blonde hair ! I called the store to let them know and to get a refund but they said they can't do anything & they could give me 2 other pizzas to replace the soiled ones I bought! Why would I want to do that to my family ! They NEED to enforce some hairnets !"}
{"text":"Little Caesars pizza. Average pizza for a really cheap price. This location is pretty fast but they run out of a lot of things fast so I've learned to call in my order.   Parking is a bit tight but it clears out in a minute so not too bad."}
{"text":"They charge 5.99 for a hot and ready pizza Not the usual 5.00 pizza. My son asked to use the bathroom, yes a paying customer, and they told him no. They said they've had too many problems!! What a joke this place is!"}
{"text":"I think the pizza in general is pretty good. Not perfect but good enough for a decent family dinner. $5 for a large pizza? Can't go wrong. I love the supreme pizza the best and it tastes and looks better than it does in the menu board. This location has a good amount of workers but it VERY busy so having to wait a little while for the deep dish pizzas or any specialties can take about 10 minutes or so. People are always coming in and out, especially around dinner time. There is always a bum outside, and I mean ALWAYS a bum outside. Sometimes two. Sometimes they earn their change by opening the door for you, which is kind of nice. This location is somewhat \"ghetto\" but I don't have any complaints about the pizza or service. They do what they can."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be hot and ready. They didn't have hot and ready. Literally waited 10 minutes just for them to take the order. Now 20 minutes and counting for the order. WTH is happening here?!?!  Then when I finally got my pizza. One seems as if it was sitting there as long as I was! Unbelievable! Then then darn cashier had to argue with me about it.  I'm very disappointed in this service!! Uncool Little Caesars! Uncool!!!!"}
{"text":"hot and ready took 30 min and then they gave it to another customer!  Has a \"C\" from the health dept!! The frame is hidden behind the dipping sauces! So much for fast cheap pizza!!  REFUND!!"}
{"text":"This location in particular is ON POINT. They almost always have pizza ready. The pizza and breadsticks are always fresh and I've never been disappointed. I frequent here at least once a week and wouldn't consider going anywhere else"}
{"text":"Little Caesar's, this is your life. My earliest memory of you was picking up one of your nifty two pies in one paper coffin deals with my dad. We were in such a hurry to get home that we floored the 79 Mustang( with horses galloping graphics) right over a huge hill and bottomed out at the foot of said hill. Don't think the car ever ran right after that. I remember your pies having those giant burnt air bubbles on them. It looked like a volcanic moon surface. Your mascot looked like half the dudes in my family( big honker, receding hairline). Then, as others have stated, you left. You said something about going out for a pack of smokes, and I never saw you again. Some dick named Giorgio tried to take your place, but I had moved on. Then you came back. With a vengeance! Gone were the air bubbles and fancy packaging. Now you are lean and mean. Five bucks, no waiting( usually) out the door. You are like a prize fighter back to kick the crap out of pretenders to the  throne. Or total bums like Domino's. A little older, not so flashy, but you get the job done. Football playoffs this weekend. And a short Italian man will be joining me on the couch to cheer on another follicly challenged cartoon back from the dead to utter his patented catchprase, Marv Albert. Yes!! Pizza, pizza. Amen."}
{"text":"The girls in the back are SCREAMING! The girl in the front with the kiss tattoo on her arm is rude. Eating and taking orders. She never said thank you to the 14 people who were ahead of me. I've been waiting for 15 minutes for two pizzas. Idk how long 2 pizzas take but they sure aren't \"hot and ready\"   The people in the back are just talking and talking and screaming and laughing at each other.  Just really not professional.    Just heard the manager yell \"I'm dead-ass right now!!l\""}
{"text":"Ugh... every once in awhile I think, oh Little Caesars is cheap and alright... let's pick some up.   This is a problem  The pizza is terrible... I know it's 5$... but still. It's just not good. I also always seem to remember liking the crazy bread, and then I get it and it's also just not good. I should have just stayed home and eaten cereal.  *sigh"}
{"text":"Ordered breadsticks with no cheese or butter on them because I'm vegan and got handed breadsticks with everything on them. I noticed and walked back in and told the guy on register if I could have breadsticks with nothing on them. He rolled his eyes at me and said \"ugh now I have to throw these away\" and snatched the everything breadsticks out of my hands like it was a huge inconvenience. He got me new breadsticks and threw them on the counter. Safe to say, I won't be going back. 3 dollar breadsticks were not worth the attitude I received."}
{"text":"Umm when you order 1 pizza, get to work and have to find a knife to slice it yourself! Not sure why they didn't slice the pizza! I tried calling them however voice mail was full!"}
{"text":"Hot and ready?? It's 11:30 am (lunch time) and we come in to pick up a quick pizza for our son and they don't have any pizza ready.   They are awful!   Throw me a bone little Caesars!!  Let's get our acts together and make that cheese pizza!!! That's all we want was a hot and ready cheese pizza.  Nothing extra or exciting!!!"}
{"text":"Literally the worse little Caesars. Customer service is off, I don't know if they are lacking common sense and intelligence. It was like talking to six year olds.    I want to add that we tried to order a half cheese and half pepperoni. Unfortunately, this was impossible for them to do!!   Seriously, I'm ordering a pizza and I want it my way, and I am waiting for my order and you can't have a personal pizza made???   These people are the worst but two stars because it appears to be clean. Otherwise I'd give it a negative rating."}
{"text":"How did someone give this place 4 stars.  It is pizza made from the cheapest possible ingredients, it is not good.  Now pizza is a simple thing, good fresh ingredients and homemade sauce goes very far.  You will never find really good pizza from a national brand"}
{"text":"Was lazy to cook dinner tonight so decided to grab a pizza. The place was packed which is fine and was told 5 to 10 minutes for it to be ready. I then walked over to vons to grab some drinks and other stuff I needed. When I got back I was pretty sure it would be ready. Ended up waiting another 10 minutes. Everyone seemed lost and unorganized. Think management needs to give better training with employees and be more prepared staff wise for these rushes."}
{"text":"Every time I've visited this Little Cesar's I've had a great pizza and I actually get a Hot and Ready right away. But this time was kind of off, upon entering and ordering my Hot and Ready, the employee seemed visibly drunk. What I mean by that is that he was stumbling and slurring his words so bad that I could barely understand. Also when you guys always asked if we want any wings or crazy bread, I said no, but as soon as I denied he said well good because we don't have any.. I thought that was kind of weird. Plus, while the gentlemen was retrieving my Hot and Ready I noticed multiple open cuts on his fingers and hands, that were not properly covered with gloves or a band aide, might be a health code violation there plus it's not pleasant to look at when we're hungry.. Other than that good pizza."}
{"text":"Was here to see if they had the bacon wrapped deep dish pizza, looks like its only available in the US. I did not like the smell in the place, found it had an old sock smell rather than a sweet pizza odor.  Looked over a few already made pizza's, they did not all look the same, settled on a deep deep dish meat pizza, not good at all compare to other choices in Vaughan, but I can see the kids liking this over the frozen supermarket stuff ....maybe?"}
{"text":"Free crazy bed my A** lol. Blonde girl made some bull excuse. Saying we had to of just ordered. We've been here for four minutes lol and noticed the sign. So don't bother asking for free bread sticks that their sign specified \"if we don't offer you a crazy combo ... it's free\" lies"}
{"text":"Worst Little Caesar's pizza I have visited. Took over 30 min to get my pizza when there was no one before us. A girl was just swinging her pizza cutter around and she was leaning all over the boxes where the pizza goes in. Some people in the back were actually working like a lady doing the pizza dough and a guy further back. However, some other employees where just playing around."}
{"text":"Got pizza today (3-18) at 5 pm and it was SO FREAKING GROSS. Pepperoni and crazy bread tasted as if it had been sitting out all day. The store was full of people waiting, which I HOPED meant I would get fresh pizza, but no such luck. Kids barely finished one piece each and I am hoping they won't be barfing later it was so disgusting. What the crap is happening over there guys??? COME ON! I think it will be a long time before I get pizza there again :-("}
{"text":"This place is horrible, the lobby would packed with customer waiting for pizza over 30mins . Employee moving slow to take care of customers ..they never have any pizza ready . Doesn't matter what time you come in."}
{"text":"This is the worst Little Caesars I've been too. Today I had my mother pick up pizza for lunch she ordered a pepperoni and a cheese pizza not only did they not have any \"Hot and Ready\" forcing her to wait almost 15mins but when the \"freshly made\" pizzas were brought home they were disgusting. The Pepperoni had so much grease on it the bottom and crust was soggy. The cheese pizza was barely covered with cheese. The only reason I didn't drive back there and demand the money back is because the lady at the register didn't give a receipt. I will not be going back to this establishment and I hope it gets shut down. From the look at all the reviews it has. Looks like it's gonna be sooner than later."}
{"text":"I came in to claim the free lunch combo promotional deal. There was a line outside with about a 20 minute wait. The advertised cut off time was 1pm. It was 11:45 and the deal was stopped. They said they were only making 140 pizzas so it was first come, first serve. Needless to say there were a lot of upset people."}
{"text":"The customer portion of this location is TINY. Perhaps 5 people can fit in there before it feels very cramped. A small portable swamp cooler was placed by the entrance to keep it from getting too warm in there, which was like a finger in a leaking dam.  The cashier seemed aloof and did not pay too much attention to what we were asking about in regards to our order. She would ask the cooks where pizzas with a different combination of toppings than ours was, to their confusion. Then turned right around and told us the pizza would be ready shortly.  Fortunately, our food came out correctly, which we were nervous about. It tasted as Little Ceasars pizza does. Nothing overly great, but it's an expensive meal or two."}
{"text":"Food: ok people get with the 411. the trick to Little C's is to CALL and put in your order so you get a fresh pizza. Seriously it's 10 minutes!   The pepperoni pan pizza is fresh and tastes like my childhood! Consistently what I expect for $9. Plus the lunch special rocks! 4 squares of pepperoni pizza and a 20 oz. DP for $5? Crazy cheap.   Service: the workers here have always been friendly to me on the phone and the pizza has always been ready when I come to pick up my order. The store is as clean as I expect."}
{"text":"This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours.."}
{"text":"They are the worst service ever!! I had to wait 30min to get my order..then They Got my order wrong and when I got home i called in them at 8:30 pm the guy that answered my phone said i had to wait 30 min again for other Order.. he was rude and hung up on me .. I called back and he would answer and hang up .. plus my pizza was brunt"}
{"text":"Horrible!! They should take down the \"Hot and Ready\" advertisement...just a bunch of kids running around in here working and no one truly in charge or leading the team!!!! Not coming back"}
{"text":"This gets 5 stars for being located right by my neighbourhood. Being there all those high school and university years where I would be staying up late to study and just felt like having a greasy pizza. Thank you Little Caesars Pizza for being there through think and thin, just like your pizza crust.  I don't visit you that often anymore, but you'll always be my #1.   But seriously, great pizza for a great price. I especially love the crust. They put the right amount of sauce as well.   Well that's all I wanted to say, if you want something quick and easy. You should definitely pass by."}
{"text":"Get pizza when fresh out the oven and your ok. If you get one that's been sitting a bit, it will taste like 5.00 lol."}
{"text":"I thought this place was supposed to have the most pepperoni and cheese well they don't one of the pieces I got had a 1/2 piece on the side and the others !!!! Well you be the judge this is it and if this is supposed to be the most well I just SMH RN !!! This is the pieces"}
{"text":"You pay 5 bucks for a large pep pizza and 3 bucks for.crazy bread. You have aeal for.2 or 3 under 8 bucks. Its.not the highest quality but for quick amd easy pizza it is a great deal. I'd rather go here and spend 2 minites inside waiting to pick up my pizza rather than 20 at most other places"}
{"text":"What part of hot -n- READY do they not understand. Only wanted something that the menu said \"ready now\".  You had one job little Caesars, have the items ready you tell people are ready.  This isn't the first time this location was standing room only with empty shelves. It will be the last time I wait. Won't go back to this location. There's so many other options in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"So I called over the phone and ordered 3 pepperoni and I was told it was going to be 20 mins .. I arrived to the location and I was told my pizzas are not and to order again and wait 20 mins .. ummm I don't think so buddy . What's the point of calling in advance ?"}
{"text":"Went during $5 Hot n' Ready primetime (5:00 PM on a Friday). It was crazy busy; like 10 people waiting around. Needless to say, no \"Hot n' Ready\" immediately available, but the team was busting their butts to make it happen as soon to immediate as possible. Took 5 minutes and I was out the door.   Nice people running the show, also. I heard singing in the kitchen, which is a good sign.   Thanks LC Spring Valley Rainbow!! Represent!!!"}
{"text":"The best!!  Im here all the time for kids, parties and school events.  The service is always great and the pizza is hot and ready. The owner is a big supporter of the community and local schools. Little Caesars supports our community and as a community we should support our local businesses.  Any negative reviews here are meaningless to me."}
{"text":"Went yesterday 9-24-15 around 5:15PM to pick up some easy dinner eats.  I'm normally not  a fan of Little Caesars but I had been cravin' pizza all day and this was easy.    It was pretty crowded when I walked in.  Gazing upon all the unwashed folks, I couldn't help but think that this is poor people food.  Cheap, bad for you, probably contributing to the downfall of America.  One lady was wearing pajama pants-no judgements-just lettin' you know what kind of atmosphere this place has.    $9.73 got me a \"hot and ready $9 box set\" which, according to their website, is ten pieces of freshly baked cheese bread with Italian spices and four slices of deep dish pepperoni pizza. Served with Crazy Sauce. Available all day & HOT-N-READY 4-8pm.  The cashier called me \"sweetie\" and I happen to like that.    The pizza was pretty great.  Buttery dough and cheese...perfectly cooked.  YUM!  My little one enjoyed it as well.  And the dog enjoyed the bits that he dropped.  Tasty, convenient, just what I wanted."}
{"text":"Got here with no one in line 6 people came after and got their food first. Horrible service. They act like they never had business before."}
{"text":"What is the point of having a phone, if you guys never answer? Did a test call while sitting in the store and no one bothered to pick up the phone... LOSING A LOT OF BUSINESS THAT WAY!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened in Fort Mill! Their place always seems to be clean the people are polite and the food always taste good and it's hot when I get it. The kids seem to absolutely love it so that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Inside the store right now.... ordered a pepperoni... should be simple...  \"7minutes\" is what they say... it's been closed to 15 and several people that ordered after me recieved theirs... so....  When I approached the counter to ask what's up they told me I need to wait.... interrupted me with a you need to wait...."}
{"text":"If you care about sanitation do not eat here.  You can see employees walking around while eating WHILE making your food.  I know a pizza goes through the oven but no workers wear gloves.  The floor is always a mess.  No hot-n-ready cheese pizza ever ready.  Always a wait of 15 minute for that and wayyy longer if custom order.    Dirty place.  Long wait.  Don't know how they are still open.   Not a 1 star because workers are friendly atleast."}
{"text":"This is the only Little Caesars in Toronto which is a crazy concept. The 5 dollar hot n ready's are delicious and my friends and I will trek out here just for it. Good spot, though the customer people weren't too friendly when I went."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Little Caesars locations over the years and this particular one is the worst.  I have been here twice and they are so cheap on the ingredients. THEY SKIMP on the cheese and toppings compared to other locations.  If you have to go to Little Caesars..avoid this location and drive a little further!!  Whoever owns this particular franchise location is a cheap piece of s***"}
{"text":"These people do not know how to do there job. They never have anything ready. Bad customer service by far."}
{"text":"Hot and \"not so\" ready. Waited 15 minutes for a pepperoni pizza. 3:00 on a Friday. Cashier is new.. (I hope) doesn't listen, has trouble making change. Interesting visit for sure.."}
{"text":"All i needed was one cheese and one pepperoni. I came here not too long after open, so i was fully prepared to have to wait for one or both to be ready, that was ok. The kid at the counter was nice but took way to long to even acknowledge me. When he did, i asked if any Hot-n-ready pizzas were prepared, he said only pepperoni. I asked how long would it be for a cheese. One of the cooks in the back (caucasian male with glasses) shouts at me from the back, with an attitude exclaiming that they had a 30 pizza order and i'll have to wait 20-25 minutes. I would've waited if that guy wasn't a jerk. I'd rather drive 15 minutes to the next location than deal with that. I don't expect top notch service considering its just a little caesars, but treating a polite customer like that almost immediately is crap."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to this location Pizza was hot, delicious, and ready to roll in just a few minutes.  Not to mention a fantastic price.  Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this little Caesars twice and I've been helped by Maria and she horrible customer service and is very unprofessional and unfriendly as well. So I hope there's a change in her performance."}
{"text":"Never have any original \"hot n ready\" available input the upgrade with extra topping. The new pizza is not worth the extra money. Need to have the original back in the hot n ready ovens."}
{"text":"The workers are MISERABLE here. No smiles no customer service at all. The worker named Sinai messed up. I ordered a DEEP DISH PIZZA with bacon. She rang it up and it was only $7 something and I know it should have been more. I said \"that's for a deep dish right?\" And she said yes. The receipt says \"large custom pizza\" so I asked her again... \"you rang this up as a deep dish right\" and once again.. she said YES. After about 10 mins of waiting for them to cook the pizza she says \"oh u ordered a deep dish right? I rang it up as a regular.\" Even though I confirmed with her MULTIPLE times. She did NOT even apologize for her mistake and she charged me $3 more for the correct pizza and I had to start all over waiting. HER mistake! No apology and didn't even offer any compensation for her error and wasting my time. Horrible service and will never come back!! Workers like this shouldn't be at the register if they can't ring up a single pizza order!  Update... She did end up giving me the incorrect pizza for free. But still no apology and lots of time wasted."}
{"text":"Very clean for LC standards, dude at the counter was chill - can't ask for much else when the pizza is $5 a pie."}
{"text":"Know pizza only costs $5.00, but, not worth it! Dough tastes like cardboard, and rather spend a little more for a good pizza!"}
{"text":"Is it still a hot and ready if you've been waiting in line 20+ minutes to get it? - seriously thought the amount of customers that this place loses from people driving off, makes me wonder how they're still in business"}
{"text":"Workers are on there cell phones, the place smells disgusting and I felt sick after eating there. Sanitation score is not posted on drive they window either. Gross"}
{"text":"Never had a problem here ..they are friendly and pizza is always hot and ready.. we go there all the time ....when i dont have the feel to cook .."}
{"text":"I just watched one of their employees walk from the dumpster walk to the back of the store and began preparing the doe without washing her hands"}
{"text":"Great option when you need to feed hungry kids and don't have time to cook dinner. I always ask to wait for a fresh hot n ready pizza so it's nice and hot when we get home. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for them to cook a fresh pizza, as they are continually making them.   Only cost $5, and I prefer this pizza over greasy Pizza Hut any day."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, but I was a bit annoyed.  The big sign says \"Hot-N-Ready all day everyday.\" Everybody knows that is their niche. When I asked for a cheese and a pepperoni I was told, \"Yeah, I don't keep them hot and ready during the day.\"  Well...that is pretty much the main reason people come to LC. I would understand if they were just temporarily out, I get that, but it was clear that they intentionally do not have them Hot-N-Ready during the day."}
{"text":"It's really sad I keep going back to This Little Caesars and they can never have hot pizza the wings are always undercooked and cold my pizza wasn't cut all the way through my pizza was hard and dry and my cheese was hard and cold already it was disgusting I'm so sick of coming back here and never getting a pizza right"}
{"text":"really !!!!!! 20 minutes for cheesy bread and hot n ready pizza lol this place is a f*cking joke. get the kids out of there !!!!"}
{"text":"Until the day of my check in, I had never been in this Little Cesar's, however I have had pizza from there often. I realize it's a Little Cesar's and there's not much to be expected, however it was National Pizza Day and I've been craving pizza for a week, still am actually. First they open at 10am, I arrived early so I went to a couple nearby stores first, I walked in around 10:20, I was greeted promptly, and waited only a couple minutes, that was good. However when I politely asked for a deep deep dish I was told in broken English those were only served 11a-2pm, I know this is untrue as my roommate often picks them up after he gets off at 330pm. It was not stated that, that was the times for Hot n Ready just that, that was the time frame they were served. There was no signage saying anything about times at all. After that was stated I kinda just stood there silently trying to figure what to say next in order to still get what I wanted in pristine condition. I chose to just walk out instead as I couldn't think of a polite way to say that was ridiculous and untrue. It was completely unprofessional and I'm not entirely sure why it happened."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst little Caesars I have ever had to deal with. The staff is rude and incompitant !! I had to wate 35 min for 1 cheese pizza and 2 bread sticks extra parm . The bread sticks had next to no parm so I ask them to fix it only to have the manager tell me I didn't order it ! Every damn time I order the same thing every time same problem no parm on the bread sticks . It's pizza not brain surgery"}
{"text":"The plan had been to eat at home.  Our friend, staying with us for the holidays, was out.  The two of us wanted to cook - we really did, but staring at the cats was taking up all of our time.  That and we were kinda at different stages of fighting off a cold.  Our friend called from the road - he was headed back to our place - and he was sick.  We said \"Bring home food\".  He was planning to stop at Walgreen's and there was a brand new Little Caesars next to it (near the address listed for this review, but not yet even officially listed.  Mine was at 19th Avenue and Southern).  I was hesitant to go w/ that one - but I figured hey, it's new.  Places are normally better than usual when they are new, right?    He got one cheese and one Peperoni.  Had it just been so many years since eating really really bad pizza that I just forgot what it was like?  Because this was NOT good pizza.  Greasy, sure.  But there was no flavor.  None.  It's like I had to check to see that I really had food in my mouth.  Sure, I could tell what it was supposed to taste like but a) Those were not high standards and b) It never even made it's own low standards.    You must be thinking wow - 2 stars?  It sounds worse than that.  Here's my thought  - I didn't get food poisoning.  Normal \"sick after eating bad greasy pizza\" feeling still applied, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  - The service was really fast as it is a \"to go\" place - the pizzas are just waiting for customers to walk in the door  - I was full after eating it  - I didn't have to cook."}
{"text":"These are the rudest people I have ever come across in my life.  I agree with previous reviews these employees are totally unhappy.   I ordered $50.00 worth of food, I handed the cashier $100.00 bill, she states \" I gotta ask my manager\".  Manger comes in front and says we can only take $20.00, I asked but what if I order $99.00 worth of food, his response was \" too bad, if you don't like it, we will refund you and you can take your business elsewhere, it really don't matter to me\"...  Wow no problem I will never spend another dime at Little Caesars ever again.    I will be sure I spread the word.   Little Caesars don't need your business.   I will be sure to let every social media page I can gain access to not to mess with this business."}
{"text":"It was a great fast experience. Kiera was really nice and friendly as well, also  I got the best advice here  \"Free never comes free\""}
{"text":"We called in an order ahead of time for a 3 meat pizza. It took us 10 mins to drive there, when my boyfriend walked in the cashier had a very nasty attitude and acted like he didn't want to be there. We waited a few minutes and then our pizza was given to us, once we got home and finally took a look at the pizza you could tell they were rushing way too much. The dough was flat and had little color, the cheese didn't look fully cooked towards the crust, and overall it was flimsy. We wouldn't have minded to wait a few extra minutes for a better quality pizza :/"}
{"text":"I am a single mother of two young kids & today was a LOUSY day. So incredibly lousy that I don't have the energy nor single ounce of desire to try & recap it. Plus, I'm sick... & exhausted. I don't even want to SIT UP in my bed, let alone think about a meal for my kids & actually get out the bed to cook said meal!  But, the rugrats are hungry & it's now 9p so I cannot avoid it any longer. I decided to order Little Caesars -- it's inexpensive & nearby so I can cover diner tonight, have leftovers for breakfast & be back in my cozy bed before I pass out in the middle of the street. As Murphy's Law would have it, my quick & amazingly well thought out mission was a complete & utter failure. I won't go into details to spare the innocent, however, the woman working the counter with the awesomely badass red hair was my personal Angel here on earth this evening. As I stood mentally panicked & staring at the internal wreckage of my failure, Red Haired Badass Awesome Chick silently stepped in and saved my day. I didn't see a cape, but she couldn't have been more of a hero to me tonight than if she'd grabbed one of my babies from in front of a speeding car... she is a shining example of humanity, love & compassion. I drove away from Little Caesar's tonight in tears... Tears of pure joy, tidal waves of relief & a heart overflowing with gratitude. Red Haired Badass Awesome Chick - THANK YOU!! I can't say Thank You to you enough times to cover how much I appreciate your act of kindness tonight.   ...oh, and the bacon-wrapped deep dish is delicious! LOL"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. What should be a hot and ready pizza takes 15 minutes on average. Employees don't care."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  Took forever. Was quoted 10 minutes it took 20. Person I'm assuming was the owner just standing around with his hands in his pockets as the teeny boppers ran around the store in a frantic fashion. Offered no assistance."}
{"text":"What happened to hot and ready?? Theres a long line for it?? Theres non ready and the cashier is nowhere to be found!! I wouldn't get pizza from this place if it wasn't requested by my friend to get the pizza from here because she thought itll be fast!"}
{"text":"I wonder why you cannot rate a place 0 stars. This location deserves it. Been waiting over 20 minutes for a pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"I love little ceasars but ever since this place reopened its horrible.. The employees are rude and I feel like I'm in like at the no soup for you place from Seinfeld.. I hope the owner reads this review and sees that he needs to staff the place better to keep up with business! BUT I will continue to go back though cause I just love their cheesy breadsticks.."}
{"text":"I don't know why these guys have such a problem with customer service. I need 4 pizzas for a birthday party and I understand that I will need to wait. I came into our closest Little Caesars again, I didn't call ahead because I started driving there before they had even opened. When I arrived there were already four people waiting for pizza.  I was not greeted, & I was the only person waiting to order. When the girl finally came out she acted all flustered and still said nothing to me. She ran around like a chicken with her head cut off and finally gave one pizza to one of the waiting customers. Then screwed around again for several minutes doing seemingly nothing and finally asked me how she could help me.  I asked for two cheese and two pepperoni, and she said I would have to wait 20 minutes.  there was a stack of pizzas hot and ready, so I asked what was available. she told me the only thing ready was chicken wings. all the pizzas that were sitting there were for phone in orders.  I had already been there 10 minutes at this point. so I left and went to a different Little Caesars."}
{"text":"This particular location used to have good pizza but I think I'll be going to a different franchise. The pizza has become really thin and hard with hardly any pizza sauce, the new renovation looks good but leaves very little room for customers when busy. There pizza is edible but that's about it."}
{"text":"Make sure you call 2 hrs ahead of time so they can figure out how to cook a pizza. I called at 2pm to order a few pizzas and they told me it would be 15 minutes, so when I showed up at 230pm they had not even started making them yet so around 315pm I finally got my pizzas. I will never give my money to this location ever again."}
{"text":"HOT OR READY ... READY BUY NOT HOT..... no wonder whether place doesn't get too many business I know it's new that's why I don't have too many  customers.... , That's why the pizza set for a long time on the window whatever they use...."}
{"text":"I was there a while ago 20 minutes wait for the pizza And asked for Chicago cut  they didn't know what the was I explain the was a square cuts... they did not get it.  it was a kid about 9 to 10 years old explain to them how to do it go figures  because we wait 20 minutes the pizza was hot."}
{"text":"I love Little Caesars but the Pizza here is not to good. I came here 3 times and they cant ever get it right. My  pizza is always soggy and mushy in the center and thats not from having many toppings. Just a regular pepperoni pizza. I rather drive a little further for a better pizza"}
{"text":"1 Star for this Rainbow/Tropicana location.   Service was horrible...the cashier was slamming the cashier drawer as if she was pissed off at the world and had a permanent frown on her face as if she were smelling burning hair from her upper lip!   Waited 18 minutes on a Tuesday at 3pm for 1 lousy pepp/sausage pizza.   We ordered 2 orders of crazy bread, one bag was burned, looking more like the color of pretzels, you know crazy bread should not be that color! Why the moron that baked that bad batch had the nerve to bag it up is beyond me.   I got home and called to speak with a store \"Supervisor\" spoke with Cody who says \"Yeah our oven is retarded and makes a lot of bad batches of our crazy bread, it is hit and miss\" I will replace your next order at no charge. Um ok... and had no response regarding the bad service from his coworker as stated he was not there, he just got on shift at 4pm.  Calling Cody and complaining was useless, he just rushed me off the phone and was clear he did not give a flying puck!   This location is the only one in the las vegas valley I have to always sit and wait forever for a freaking pizza. Also the only location with employess who have the personality of Prisoner's waiting their turn in death row.   I am not a fan of their cheap, bland and flavorless pizza in the first place, I only come here at the request of my baby sister (26) who happens to like their pizza, ugh.   Next time I will put my foot down and say hell no to \"LITTLE SKEEZERS\"   I am through with this location...done done done, enough said!   To the crew at this location, you can all go to hell, you all have a bad attitude every single time! Yes, it is clear you hate your job, don't make me suffer for your employment decisions!  Bite Me!"}
{"text":"Walked in waited to place my order at least fifteen minutes. The woman ( I use that term loosely) that is running the place is yelling for Tony, OK there are too other woman and myself in the store, no one is answering. Did she ever think that may be he was not here. Tony did show up and yes for ten minutes she stood calling for Tony only to tell him she gave his pizza's to someone else. In the meantime I placed an order for two deep dish pepperoni pizzas. They only had one ready and said it would be 5 minutes the place started to get crowded and pizzas were going out the door right and left finally I said hey I am waiting on two pizzas and you're giving one away after already giving one away before that. Then the woman screams from the back well it's only been 5 minutes whatever happened to hot and ready so I told her I want my money back and she just started to mouth off. Goodbye to Little Caesars forever."}
{"text":"We need to be able to give minus star reviews.  This is a company store with the worst employee training anyone has ever seen. It is unbelievable until you have to put up with it. We go in tonight at 735pm and order 2 hot and ready  pepperoni pizzas.  The cashier Adaja Y. takes my money and tells me it will be a little bit before they are ready. I ask what she means by that since I'm looking at 4 pizzas in the warmer. There are 2 families and 3 other people standing around in the place. She says they are for orders that are taken.  I asked why was everyone  standing around waiting for her to give them their order.No answer. ....she turns around and removes 2 pizzas to give me. First one she scans is over its time limit and she puts it on the bottom shelf of the pizza cutting station .Next she scan 2 more and now I can see there are 4 more pizzas in the warmer. She hands them to me and out the door we go. Get them home and both have to be recut cuz they did not cut one piece of both pizzas through. WTH  ."}
{"text":"Customer service leaves a lot to be desired. The girl at the register arguing with the boy in the back about who is to blame for getting a man's pizza order wrong, is out of line when there are 8 people waiting to order.11-10-2015 This company has a awful lot of work in front of them.So I go there on Veterans Day at 1 pm and I'm told by the young girl at there counter that they are no longer giving the Special $5.00 lunch to Veterans today. I asked why since the sign on the soda cooler states that from 11am until 2pm  Vets will receive a free $5.00 lunch.  She stated that her manager Diela stopped it and only allowed 30 free lunches. They also had no pizza available for purchase either. Took 10 minutes to make any for the 10 people waithig."}
{"text":"This pizza store has been in business for awhile.  I don't know if it's a franchise anymore.  It would be nice if they trained the people that work there.  The crew there  that is making pizzas now doesn't know the difference between round and square.  lol. I ordered the 2 square deep dish pizzas and got 2 little round pizzas. When I asked what happened the girl replied\"that's how we make them\". There are other pizza restaurant around here so you may want to go somewhere, where they know the difference between round and square.  The amount of cheese applied to the pie is getting smaller also."}
{"text":"Not so hot and ready. More like wait 15 mins for crazy bread that's cold... Another bummer was that they don't offer combo deals like other locations. Everything is sold separately."}
{"text":"Located SW corner of Cactus & 75th ave. (yelp map is incorrect).  Strip mall location, just a couple doors down from Subway.   Very cheap food here but decent for that price.  Crazy bread with sauce is hard to beat for $2.38.  Nice people working at this location.  Fair amount of parking."}
{"text":"Where's the hot and ready? Every time I've been here I've had to wait at least 20 minutes! They'll have ten people standing in there and you'll see their employees walking around having conversations with their co-workers.. Like really? In addition, their overall customer service is horrible. They get 1-star for good pizza and crazy bread."}
{"text":"I would hope the owner reads these reviews. He/she needs to find a real manager somebody who can whip this location into shape. I have never been there when they have pizza actually ready for customers that are there. They are always behind, and they have very poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"If a customer chooses to wait for fresh pizza, you should never charge them extra do so. I was there yesterday around 3:00pm and ordered the Italian Cheese Bread. Lady at the counter offered the hot and ready ICB in the warmer. I insisted it looked unappetizing and chose to wait  for a fresh one. I stepped over to the side and waited 5 minutes. And then, the lady at the counter approached me and demanded I paid an additional $1.00 more the fresh ICB THAT I ALREADY PAID FOR which made no sense to me. I asked for a manager and found out it was he who delegated to the associate I had no choice but to pay the dollar or take what's in the warmer. I called their corporate number and later found out the Silverado Ranch and Bermuda store is owned by a franchisee. I later visited the store on Durango and Warm Spring which was corporate owned and found out you do not have to pay an additional amount of money to have your pizza freshly prepared. Little Caesars on Silverado Ranch and Bermuda practices scamming their customers and not giving a cufk about it. All this for pizza right?"}
{"text":"I can't seem to understand why it's so hard to have pizza ready!  Whoever is the manager at this location is obviously not doing their job. I usually try to get a pizza or pizzas at this location being it's close to my home. I want to beat the dinner rush so come between 3p-5:30 ish. Never have any pizzas available. Always have to wait 15 min or more. Workers aren't very friendly but I can see why if manager doesn't care. Sorry but this was my last attempt with this location. Can't be too hard with their simple menu"}
{"text":"I went to the store 1:30hr before they close I was trying to order deep deep dish or Italian cheese pizza but this lady on the cashier I don't know her name because I didn't get my receipt. She said that they don't have any of them, how in the hell they don't have the ingredients to make that kind pizza! She was very ungrateful and rude! So I end up getting a cheese pizza and chicken wings that took us 40 mins of waiting"}
{"text":"I give them 1 star because it's cheap.  My biggest complaint is when I call to order ahead, I always get \"they're here hot and ready.\"  I have 2 little ones and I refuse to sit and wait for 20 minutes because they can't keep up with the demand during their peak hours.  LIES ALL LIES!!  I called last night and was told the same thing, if I could make it in 5 minutes there's pizza.  Well I insisted on them taking my order because I was on my way home from picking up my kids, 15 minutes away.  Low and behold I get there around 8:45 and there's a bitching line and people waiting for pizza.  Call ahead, call ahead and don't let the manager tell you they're available hot and ready because they're lying.  Hot and ready my ass.  It's more like stand inside for 20 minutes and be hot and irritated."}
{"text":"People were actually in there waiting for Pizza tonight. AND today is a Wednesday. My dumb behind messed around and ordered a special pizza so I had to wait 17 mins for it. Boy was I stupid."}
{"text":"it's little caesars...  pepperoni pizza tastes the same as it did when I was a little kid - like corporate pizza.  it is what it is.  frequently they don't have anything \"hot and ready\". And frequently if they do it is gross.  Check the box before you leave.  Very inconsistent and sometimes sad."}
{"text":"My family and I came in at 9 after a baseball game. It is Lent so we decided to have cheese pizza. The cashier/manager was very rude and complained that he had to make all 4 pizzas by hand. They had no pizzas ready and he made it very clear that he DID NOT want to accommodate us. He told us it would be at least 30 minutes. He was visibly frustrated and annoyed that we agreed to wait. He went to his co-worker and started the pizzas. Then he would glance back at us as if he was talking crap. As we were waiting, another group came into the store and he chased them away. One wanted breadsticks and he told them: \"no, you don't want those--they have been there all day.\" When we got home, our breadsticks were undercooked. The marinara sauce was given to us cold as well. We went back to the store and he complained AGAIN that it would take 15 minutes to make new breadsticks and said the store was closed. It was 9:50. NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS STORE."}
{"text":"Just the worst. The service is terrible. Don't try to order over the phone. Only go for the ready made pizzas and don't expect more than that so you won't get disappointed. Except when they mess that up too. Just the worst."}
{"text":"Slowest \"hot and ready\" pizza ever. 20 minutes in line to order and another 20 minute wait for a pizza. This place sucks. Must have horrible ownership/managers."}
{"text":"I just came in With my daughter ordered to extra most bestest pizzas the lady informs us that it's gonna be 12 minutes we go next door come back sit there and wait and wait then I asked her when our food's gonna be ready she gets an attitude goes to the back and we watch her a grab it and bring it to the front so now I'm sitting here with my kids eating cold pizza that I waited 25 minutes for."}
{"text":"I was looking for a pizza take out joint on south blvd. The place in the next shopping center was closed for some reason but I remembered a place in this shopping center but I didn't think it was a Little Caesars. But oh well, I didn't have time to run around looking for something else.  They have a daily lunch special of a 4 slice rectangular pizza and 20oz drink for $5 (plus tax). That's the only smaller portion I saw so I went with it.   The pizza was decent, Sicilian style. Nothing to write home about but in my opinion better than the big 3 delivery places.  It's been a long time since I've had LC's pizza so this was a nice find."}
{"text":"So don't judge me but I have never in life had Little Caesars Pizza until recently.  I will say that I definitely wasn't missing out on anything big or grand. However, for $5 for a Hot & Ready Large Pepperoni Pizza it was a good deal.  The pizza itself had way more pepperoni on it than I thought it would. Definitely a lot of bread and not a super cheesy pizza, but for $5 I am not going to cry about it. It fed my family for dinner one night and at a great price if you ask me.  We also got a side of the cheesy bread sticks and those were pretty good.   The location itself is pretty busy, so the parking lot can sometimes be tight. And you are bound to see some interesting characters."}
{"text":"Order a pizza at 11:20pm and they quote you a 20 min wait to pick up. One hour later pizza still not ready. Next time I will just pay the extra few dollars at dominos."}
{"text":"Online says they close at 10 everyday, when in reality it's only 10 on fridays and Saturday's."}
{"text":"Just terrible service. I came in and stood at the counter for 3-4 minutes. I was only acknowledged because I was making efforts to find someone to help me. My order was taken then the employee walked away; didn't say my total, when I would pay, to have a seat. I'm not a mind reader so I continued standing until she came back. This is why I prefer the other location.   Update 2.14.18  Way better! The cashier was different and was great communicating my wait time. The other employee was making the pizzas and you could tell they enjoyed working together. Bumping them up to three stars."}
{"text":"If you expect to walk in and have a pizza waiting for you, this is NOT the place for you!!! You would think at dinner time they prepare more pizzas!! Terrible service!!!! No apologies, poorly managed!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was very courteous and professional! Love to see businesses still value that. Everything I wanted was \"hot n' ready\" so it was a quick and easy in and out. The location was clean, and of side note it is located more off of Hayden than Thomas."}
{"text":"Place is horrible every time I come here i have I have to wait at least 15mins for their so called hot-n-ready pizza. They need to change the name to hot-and-not-so-ready!!!  It's easy make 5 or 10 pies and replenish as orders come out. It's called a par people.  But a place ran by a bunch of teens with no management or not very good management I shouldn't except more.  What a joke surprised there isn't more bad reviews about the place."}
{"text":"It's by the house so I've stopped by a few times to pick up a hot n ready pizza for a quick lunch or dinner. The times that I've visited this location they had the hot n ready pizzas ready to go. One time I did make the mistake of asking about the red peppers and parm cheese. The worker told me we don't offer those any more and \"what do you expect for a $6 pizza\". Less than mediocre pizza and low quality service screams avoid this place but at times I stop by purely out of the convenience of it being less than half a mile from my house and really cheap."}
{"text":"I live in the area and come here often. Excellent fast service and the crew is energetic. The pepperoni pizzas for $5 are not world changing but it feeds larges family's and no one EVER complains about pizza. I like to order ahead for a freshly made 3 meat pizza. Always done within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This is kind of an elaborate review of the Little Caesar's on the corner of Indian School road and 83rd ave. I hope it isn't indicative of all the others. I hate to admit, I have been coming here off and on for about 10-12 yrs. It is close by and located in a dirty strip mall between a rib shack and a Dollar store and the parking area is shared with a Food City (closed now) and a Chinese food restaurant. Needless to say parking is at a premium especially evenings and Friday nights. I only go there when I don't feel like cooking dinner or there is nothing in the frig. (plus it's cheap $5 for a lg. pepperoni)  I usually call in advance for my order and it is always ready and on time because after looking for a place to park and going to the counter passing a hoard to the counter takes about 20 to 30 min. The interior is about the size of an elevator and is packed like sardines. (Big time B. O.)  After making it to the counter and waiting to pick up my order I get a chance to watch the kitchen staff. Unlike most of the customers, I am about 6ft. tall and have a good vantage point. If you want to eat your pizza don't look. Just put your blinds on and leave quickly. Hopefully your car is still there. But if you decide to look you will notice food prep without gloves, no hair nets, cashiers handling food after handling money, staff eating while working, half eaten pizzas on working surfaces, phone orders being taken while eating or boxing up your order, flies in the window dead and alive, walls and floors thick with grime, kitchen area and equipment filthy with old grease, workers unkempt, dirty and disheveled looking. Pretty sad, to say the least, but surprisingly I have never gotten \"physically\" ill ( I think I have built up a tolerance/ immunity or lucky) and the pizzas taste pretty darn good and hot. They have never messed up my order either. AMAZING!! If you do decide to go...enter at your own risk.  I will probably go there again and push my luck. I just wish they would clean up their act!!! Good luck!"}
{"text":"always really busy,great price for pizza but i would recommend you call your order in first."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza, but acceptable over Frozen ones. They use a large amount of oil, while making the pizza, which is understandable, but it leaves a huge greasy mess, on my passenger seat on the ride home, which sucks. The customer service is decent. There are the really nice, respectful employees, and then there are the extremely rude and weird ones which leave me never wanting to return, but I eventually good because of the crazy bread."}
{"text":"Vegetarian:  I have frequented multiple Little Cesar's locations since I was a child and we always order the same thing: cheese pizza and itallion cheese bread. They also offer routine vegetable toppings. The pizza is a good value for the money, it's not fantastic but it's only 6 dollars. The itallion cheese bread is great because they smother it in lots of cheese, and seasonings. Their cheese bread is better than any of the chains including Papa John's, Dominos, and Pizza Hut. I've? always really enjoyed this restaurant.   Vegan:  This is not a good pizza place for vegans. They don't offer a vegan cheese  Gluten-free: This is not a good pizza place for people who don't eat gluten because they don't offer an alternative crust.   Service: I ate here with my mom on this occasion and she can be very particular. She doesn't like to have her take-out pizza cut, and so we requested that when we called in. Unfortunately, they cut the pizzas and we didn't realize until we were gone. When I called to let them know of the mistake, they offered to remake the order for free and so I was completely satisfied with the service I received. If you don't ask for anything special, you can just walk-in and out with pizza immediately.  Recommendations: I can only recommend it to vegetarians, but it's a very strong recommendation."}
{"text":"It is in an odd location and looks somewhat ghetto from the outside but the pizza and the crazy bread is so good. I don't know where you can go and get a large pizza, 8 breadsticks, and a 2 liter of soda for $9. The price is low and the food is excellent quality. Can't wait to be back more often"}
{"text":"Pizza is never made \"normal\" at this location. It's either stale, under cooked, or burnt. I'm tired of the consistent irregular pizza at this location."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Waited 25 minutes for. Hot N ready cheese pizza!!!  Got some so sorries, but people who came in after me got pizza first.  Terrible."}
