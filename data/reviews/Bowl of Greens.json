{"text":"What a great place. Was not sure how it would be when we walked in, but I was very pleased on the way out. We used to go here when it was Daphnes,and were sad when they closed. Happy to report,this new place is wonderful. I had the salmon entree and it was quite good. I don't know what they use to make the rice that came with it, but it was my favorite part of the meal. Friendly staff low price point for this area. We will be back for sure. I hope they stay.."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Scottsdale for a quick, healthy meal!  Fantastic salads (all food is homemade) great salmon, shrimp and grilled veggies!  Also, Baba Ganoush is wonderful and the chicken veggie soup is fantastic!  Owner is very nice too"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 different things (pasta, chicken and rice with sweet potato, and I forget the other) and nobody was very impressed. The staff was friendly though and the place was clean, but I wouldn't come here again. Lots of options though."}
{"text":"This place is dope gangstas! If you're lookin to feel fresh as heck and like a happy healthy little clam, grab yo self a bowl of greens!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Trying it for the first time... Got the chicken kabob entree for under ten bucks and the portion is huge. Tons of salad and vegetables! Great value for the price! Super clean in here and the service has been fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch...

Positives:  Service was friendly and the food was good.  The roasted vegetables were simple, but delicious.

Negatives:  For not being busy at all on a Monday, waited quite a while for a sandwich.  Ended up spending $13 for an eggplant parm sandwich and a small side of vegetables... not a whole lot for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm obsessed with the pita chips they place in their salads. Their smoothies are amazing and taste natural. They need to stay open later!!!! Please be open on the weekends also."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The employees & owner are awesome, and the food is ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"Extremely over priced for the portion size. Poor customer service- including the whopping surcharge for something basic like sriracha. Go elsewhere!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are a bit on the healthy side or just love salads they also have other food but I didn't try it."}
{"text":"I got a \"make your own\" salad and was pleasantly surprised with the big portion size of the salad and the amount of (yummy) chicken on there. It actually fills you up and leaves you satisfied unlike some of the other salads you find in Scottsdale! Would highly recommend their house dressing and pita chips!"}
{"text":"4 stars. Clean. Fast. Fresh. The smoothies were good, and all of the food was cooked well. We got the chicken kebabs and a few salads. The kebabs were really good, and only took a few minutes. Tzeziki (sorry for the misspell) dressing was good as well."}
{"text":"What's wrong with Bowl of Greens

1. They don't give you a student discount unless you specifically ask for it, even if you are using an ASU sun-card. There has been multiple times where I have forgotten to ask until after they swept the card, and they can't do anything about it. I've talked to other people who've had similar experiences, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was management telling workers not to mention it, almost as if to hide the fact that they even have it. 

2. Very expensive in general. The \"under $10\" thing on the side can be pretty misleading; if you get a meal and a drink it is undoubtedly going to cost you over $10.  

3. Customer service. The actual people who work there are fine; I've never seen them mess something up, but the manager is extremely intense, as talked about in other Yelp reviews. Seems like a bad work environment, and I've heard of other students on ASU Downtown campus seeing him berate or yell at employees. 

4. I was once doing an assignment for a class that involved taking photos of things outside of the school, me and my partner decided to go inside Bowl of Greens to take some pictures. We took a few before the manager scolded us for doing so without permission and essentially told us to leave. I understand if you don't want to have pictures taken, but just calm down dude. You're connected to a journalism school, and a good chunk of your business comes from journalism students and faculty, so I'm not sure that's the best way to go about things. 

The thing is I actually really do like the food at Bowl of Greens. The Falafel is delicious, the eggplant as well, and the smoothies are completely on point. But considering the problems i saw with everything else there, after giving them a ton of business I started feeling wrong going there. I haven't gone to Bowl of Greens in about three months now, in a 'boycott' of sorts. I'll go back when management treats customers better."}
{"text":"I have been to bowl of greens many times since I work nearby.

The food here is OK although I'm not a fan of how they cook the chicken and other things in advance and just have it sitting out...  They have a relatively extensive selection of salad ingredients to create your own salad which is nice and unique in this area.  Or you can order one of the many sandwiches pitas such as Chicken & Hummus.

Prices are pretty reasonable (think $6-10 for salad/sandwich/entree) although the portion sizes are small so it's not really as good a deal as it might appear.

The more I have gone here the more average it seems but it is still an okay place to grab a light and healthy lunch with a slight Mediterranean twist, particularly since there aren't many places like this downtown."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I've eaten at a few mediterranean restaurants in the valley but the lamb kabob with rice and salad was very fresh and tasted delicious! The service was great with friendly staff. A very clean environment with nice ambiance. I highly recommend this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great! Had the berry one and put peanut butter in it... taste just like pp&j, was delish! I also tried the chicken saut√© and added honey mustard... also, very good. Place was clean, efficient, and friendly. I've been back several times."}
{"text":"Tasty, affordable choice! I've been to Bowl of Greens for lunch a few times now because of its convenient location. It's always slammed when I arrive (I seem to always walk in right after a 1L property class), but they move people through the line pretty quickly. The employees are nice, and I haven't had a bad service experience there. The salad greens are crispy, and the options are plentiful. Their chicken could definitely benefit from some seasoning, but if you're putting it in a salad, the dressing will help. I'll keep persevering through the line because, other than Grabbagreen, this is the only true, whole foods based salad shop in downtown. It's great to have an extra option! My only other criticism is that, because they're always slammed, they really need a second door. Right now, there's only one, so people exiting have to weave through the line of people waiting to order."}
{"text":"Really healthy, fresh, and affordable. They also give ASU students a discount. All smoothies are delicious and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Such a great variety of fresh good authentic food. They have something for everyone: from veggies and salads, to pastas and meats, and a full juice and smoothie bar to boot. The owners clearly care about their customers and are here to make sure you enjoy. Has already become one of our favorites and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever you can think off, in any chain! i went in with my work stress to feel better and also to eat healthy as i was in that area , this may be my second time to this store first time to this location dont remember!

Anyway but story starts here,

I had salmon in mind so i ordered whatever i saw with salmon , no introduction of food no explanation, they hand over me slip with waiting number but it was useless didnt  know what it is for first , later on when i breath properly , i asked them what other options are which i would have gone with if they greeted me nicely and explained more about the menu and when i went out on call, they waited until i came in to prepare my salad .

I asked salad #8 lady replied there are so many #8 in rude way, uhhhhh... wow...... are working over here. I had to go and pick up another lunch because option i choose was unfortunate.

No wonder they had to put up label that we are working on our customer service to better serve you!!!!!!!

No need to mention that what i got in salad is few greens and small piece of half grilled salmon , forget to take picture because i was feeling low on sugar my intention was to eat anything.

i work in area there are so many better places if you spend more then 10$ , that will make your day at work.

i never care to post on Yelp but today my frustration with service i got is sky rocket."}
{"text":"The best word to describe Bowl of Greens is \"inconsistent.\" I've been in on multiple occasions and ordered the same thing. Each time, I get a different result. The food typically tastes pretty good, but after feeling like a herd of cattle going through the line, it's not my first choice. And don't bother asking for anything that deviates from their few sandwich choices because chaos will ensue. I also am not a fan of the communal chicken scrap pile. Most of the sandwiches and entrees include chicken, so there is always a pile of the most finely diced chicken on the counter. When you order, the servers just grab a handful and throw it on your plate. Too bad this is the best of several bad lunch options at ASU Downtown"}
{"text":"**3.5 stars... For only being open a week it really isn't that bad. I didn't try and of their salads or sandwiches, not many vegan choices. The smoothie I had was a berry smoothie and I asked for granola on top cause I was in a mood for a smoothie bowl which they didn't have. The owner was really nice and we have him some suggestions.
Definitely a lot to work on but give it a shot, just a tad over-priced. You also hand to pay more for add-one which I think should already in the smoothie. But they tasted very fresh!"}
{"text":"Says they are open 8am-8pm everyday, at 6:50pm they were closed. The doors were open but the lights were dim. Please update hours, thanks."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb kabob plate. It was the worst lamb I have ever had. It was over cooked, dry, and I know lamb is a fatty meat but this lamb was just gross. The salads I have had there in the past were wonderful so, I know they have some quality. But for myself working in the food industry I wouldn't eat there again. The staff wasn't friendly at all! I ordered my food for here but then I asked to change it to to go. They made it for here and when they transferred my food into a container their body language looked ever mean. The rice tasted like it was sitting out all day. Oh and when I was ordering I asked what is on the salad that comes with the plate and the staff barely knew it was just lettuce and dressing. When I asked for caesar instead of the house dressing they were mad that it was extra work. Also for $10 a plate (after tax) I would expect a decent amount of food but all I got were four small pieces of meat, dry rice and a very small salad. All in all with unfriendly staff, dry food, poor amount of food given and very high prices for low quality food makes it so I will never go there again. The only good thing about the place is the manager who is the only one who seemed to care and the make your own salad."}
{"text":"Great menu selection, and the food is always fresh! Prices are very reasonable compared to anywhere eale nearby."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the 4 topping selection. There was not 4 topping that I liked but even though I only choice one topping I could not get cheese without paying another .75 cents. Why would anyone pay $7 for lettuce and cheese! No second chances!!"}
{"text":"I ordered to-go and paid with my credit card online. When I arrived to the restaurant, I was told to wait behind the line of customers to get up to the cash register. The employee saw me standing behind the customers and made eye contact with me a few times, but ignored my online order pick up. I finally stepped up and said I need to just pick up fully paid for orders and she was short one of my coworkers orders. I told her what the order was and that it was paid for online, and she told me I never paid and there isn't an order so I will have to wait in line to reorder it and actually pay for it this time... SO RUDE! I left and will never go back. Worst customer service ever. Do not order online here!!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for a while on this terrific place. We originally discovered this by doing a search for healthy places to eat around downtown. We live a few miles away however this is worth the effort. We have made the trip several times since discovering it and found each time that the food and service are outstanding. The food if fresh and made to order. The salads are wonderfully prepared. There have never been any issues with slight adjustments to the sandwiches that my sons order. Kid can be a little picky at time. The fresh pita chips are some of the best around. My boys will take those over chips and we are always buying a couple extra bags to take home. The smoothies are my boy's favorites. I also wanted to take time to recognize the owner. Each time we have come in he has always greeted us. He takes the time to get to know you and make you feel welcome. He is very hands on and does get behind the counter to assist and make sure that your experience is the best possible. I have seen a couple of the same employees there on multiple visits which is also a good sign.
Fresh food, great smoothies, outstanding service.  This is worth the trip or if you are already downtown make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!!  We crave the chicken Caesar salad almost every other day.  I've also tried their pizza and Mediterranean platter and they are also very tasty.  The staff is really friendly and very helpful and they go out of their way for you.  The manager/owner is super friendly and kind.  I can't get enough of this place, I just wish we lived closer that way I can use this as an excuse not to make dinner!  It's a very clean, and welcoming environment.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Love the roasted veggie salad and my husband loved his chicken kabobs! Service could be friendlier!"}
{"text":"I actually like the food (I usually order a combination of sides) BUT the manager is just awful. I echo a number of other reviewers in the fact that she is unbelievably rude to the staff and has no problem belittling them in front of the customers. She yells at them if they are giving too much of an item and then has no problem pointing out to the customer that they really received too much food and should be paying more.  It is shocking and so uncomfortable to witness."}
{"text":"Was craving a salad found this place in yelp it is amazing!!! Great food and customer service!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, I regularly chat with the owner, delicious food. It can take longer than I'd like to order and receive my food, but it's mostly because the place is so popular it's often packed and they make a lot of dishes fresh when you order them. Lots of healthy options here including plenty of vegetarian friendly dishes, great salads, delicious veggies and they REALLY know how to cook chicken. This is one of my all time favorite places, and one of my go-to spots when I need a healthy lunch. They also do smoothies and fresh pressed juices, all of which are delicious. 

Let's take a moment to talk about those juices, okay? At this place, I can get 24 oz of delicious juice, pressed right in front of my eyes, for $6. If I go down the street to any other juice bar, I get 16 oz or less, pressed at an unknown time, for over $10. If you're looking for healthy juices, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love this place! Local and family owned.  The Fresh juice bar has a great selection and is priced just right. Their salad bar is perfect, I love the large selection of fresh produce to choose from. There are numerous dressings to choose from too! You can add a Protein to your salad of choice. They also have Hot lunch items such as the Chicken Kabob which is pretty tasty. They have only been open for a few weeks now so they're still learning the ropes; however the staff is very friendly. A must try!"}
{"text":"Great Greek salad and chicken kabobs!  Staff was pleasant and restaurant was very clean. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well, it used to be so great! but as of recently many things have changed! (1-14-14) The prices are still the same, yet the quality of it has decreased a bit. I use to LOVE their salads, and i kid you not i could not find sufficient lettuce in a salad. They also used to supply a little bag of chips No extra charge, but now the policy has changed and you must purchased the chips. Which is Fine, but then when i got to my smoothie...oh boy it was watered down sufficiently. It's not even a smoothie anymore more like JUICE! So UPSET! i doubt i will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I work in the area and I go to the Promenade at least twice weekly.  I stumbled upon Bowl of Greens, and it was a delicious surprise.  There was another restaurant like this about a half of mile north (I think it was called Eating at Raw - really not sure). It was a great restaurant, but it went out of business really fast.  

They have great and affordable sandwiches, salads, and smoothies.  

Check it out."}
{"text":"I work at ASU-Downtown, and whenever I wake up too late for breakfast or forget my lunch, my go-to restaurant is Bowl of Greens. BOG is a healthy, whole-food, green, & on-the-go concept restaurant. I've recommended it to campus visitors, too, who were very happy with the selection. I've enjoyed breakfast and lunch/supper items as well as coffee, tea, and smoothies. 

The smoothies are fresh and made from real ingredients. A list of ingredients is provided at the counter, so you can judge how thick it will be. If you don't get it made with yogurt or powders, it will be thinner, but it is still a smoothie. You pay a bit more for the convenience of the location and the freshness of the real food, but it's worth it! It could be argued that BOG is over priced, but you're paying for whole food, speed, and convenience of location. This is not your SAD (Standard American Diet) kind of place with SAD proportions.

Personally, I enjoy the Spinach Mango smoothie with whey protein; Mocha Smoothie with peanut butter or whey protein; and the arugula salad add chicken and goat cheese, substitute with BOG dressing. The roasted veggies are great, too. Regarding the the negative reviews for BOG, be sure you read between the lines of the text and view their photos. Seriously! Ha!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Healthy, delish, and fast ! 
The is clean and bright. Makes one happy !"}
{"text":"This is such a great place when you want a healthy meal. From the create your own salads to the delicious entrees, everything is delicious, healthy and fresh. The staff is always helpful and nice. The roasted veggies are so good I crave them daily (now if I could just stop craving all of the sweets too!!)."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix was in desperate need of exactly this place - fresh vegetable juices, smoothies, build-your-own salads -  My personal fave is the option to add grilled shrimp... YUM!  Oh and the carrot, ginger, lime, kale juice is great too!

The delivery service (on bright green bikes!), is speedy and environmentally friendly.  I love that on busy days at work, I don't even have to leave my desk to get a delicious and nutritious \"bowl of greens\"!"}
{"text":"I've been going to ASU downtown for over a year but just tried this for the first time. While I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, I got it! The grilled chicken Caesar salad was DELISH. The chicken was flavored to perfection and was juicy, not dry like a lot of places can be. Because it's located on our campus, I wish the prices were lower for us broke college kids but you can't really complain when you get quality like this. The staff was also very nice and they had fun music playing. I will be frequenting this place more often now that I know what they have to offer. I'm excited to try their fresh smoothies and hummus next time! 

-My only qualm with this place would be the to-go boxes. They're cute and convenient, until you go to eat out of it. Then the flaps get in the way. Not a huge deal though."}
{"text":"Walked in today for lunch as I had been eyeing this place for a while as it is adacent to the downtown ASU campus. Walked in for lunch and told the short hispanic girl behind the counter only asked what I wanted on my salad. I looked at the list of toppings available, and they didn't have over half of what the list described. The disgruntled girl said they only had what was out... Most of the available toppings looked old and dried out (mushrooms were especially brown). Asked for grilled chicken on my salad before I saw it... sitting in a holding bind in a pool of oil. The chicken was very charred and dry. My salad was edible, but not much more and definitely not worth the $9 price tag. Other counter help seemed friendly, but the girl who helped me was unhelpful and not friendly. 

I rarely write reviews, but my disappointing experience prompted me to write this review as I sat in the restaurant, as not to forget to post. I was hoping for a frequent/healthy dining spot as I am on campus everyday. I guess I will stick with my other options as I will not be returning to Bowl of Greens."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here! I love that this place switched out croutons for pita chips. I have never looked at a Chicken Cesar salad the same since having theirs. I made sure I got a job that was close enough to get one of their salads and amazing smoothies at least once a week. :)"}
{"text":"Aweful experience:( after waiting in line in Phoenix location for 15 minutes, I ordered heir signature shrimp salad and mango smoothie. The ice machine was broken, so I waited for another 15 mins while it was fixed. Finally when I got my 'signature salad' and opened it I realized that apparently it included 3 shrimp and a bunch of cheap greens for $12!!! Smoothie wasn't too bad but not good enough for $6. Big disappointment. Overpriced food, terrible customer service and semi-decent food. Please don't waste your time and money at downtown Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Super yummy! I got pita chips with hummus and a chicken cedar wrap. Fresh! The staff were very helpful since it was my first time there."}
{"text":"Seems super legit, miss having places like this since moving away from The City.  Definitely in the pish-posh part of town, but all the workers seem super chillax."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The roasted vegetables were super tasty! I was looking for something healthy (protein + veggies), this was perfect! The decor is very modern & quaint. The bathroom was clean. The employees were very nice."}
{"text":"GREAT customer service. The \"Big O\" smoothie was phenomenal! Generous portion size for the create your own salad. Will def be coming back again!"}
{"text":"He breakfast hash is so good. Pair it with the chili mango sauce to give it some kick. Healthy ingredients make you happy to eat there."}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch whenever I'm in the mood for a healthy option that's quick and delicious. During lunch time the lines get really long and you have to wait a little but it does go by fast."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast since it was convenient for my son who's at Taylor Place. I was shocked at how rude the lady was behind the counter. Her tone and attitude was horrible. We all thought our food tasted great, but will not be back because she has no clue how to treat people. If you're in the food industry or in customer service, and have to encounter people, why not be pleasant? Be fake! But be nice! YOU chose this job! We were all disappointed and being that our wraps were yummy it sucks that a person like that can keep us from this business."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken Caesar salad I've ever had.  They are generous with the grilled chicken and homemade pita croutons.  Never long lines and they are fast and courteous."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place over price then u get shitty avocados I would never give this to customers n I work in the industry.... Smh place look promising not at all portions r small ppl r rude even when I ask what items were never coming back"}
{"text":"Detestable ownership, popped in to buy some food during my class break. Unfortunately I was able to realize how the so call owner of this place mistreats it's  employees by yelling to them in front of the customers as if they were slaves. On that same visit I ordered my 12 dollar salad( with only 3 shrimps) and sat there eating it and as I looked up there was a small nasty cockroach by the window and that just totally grossed me out, I can't even imagine how the kitchen must be. It's probably infested with roaches. I won't be eating here again and I encourage everyone to NOT support this business as you will be supporting a bigot exploitative ownership."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best healthy lunch place I ever been too. The food is awesome and they have full smoothie bar inside which I  
Five Star *****"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for lunch near my office. Salads are always delicious with fresh ingredients although I usually get the chicken kabob or just a side of chicken with veggies. The kabob is so flavorful and the veggies are cooked perfectly. I am also super picky about hummus and theirs is my favorite! The owner is always working his butt of to make sure everyone gets what they need and has a pleasant experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! I went here for lunch today around 11:30am.  I had the Chicken breast entree with roasted veggies which consisted of cauliflower, sweet potatoes, and broccoli.  It also came with rice.  EVERYTHING was super tasty!  The rice was really good and I loved the broccoli.  I also ordered the Energizer Juice.  It was made fresh right there at the counter. Very good and healthy tasting.

The only thing I wish they did differently was put the caloric info next to their menu items like a lot of restaurants have started doing.  I think it's helpful for people who are tying to be healthy.  Either way, I will definitely go back to this place.  So good!"}
{"text":"Another bad place..but it was more likely my bad choice. The veggie delight was a very undelightful mix of mozzarella,  lettuce and roasted red peppers and sun dried tomatoes that nearly cut my mouth. The pita bread broke apart while eating spilling all the nasty ingredients onto the unclean table and there were flies hanging out all over the joint as well. Too many choices of bad stuff and why is the counter guy handing me samples with his tongs straight onto my hand? College kids probably like this place..but any adult should know better and try a real restaurant."}
{"text":"I asked before hand if the smoothie had anything other than fruit. Girl at front desk was rude and said nothing other than fruit. Then proceeds to use some sort of syrup flavoring in it... I won't be taking my business back here ever again!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I love this place! It's close to my office, the food is great and there is an ASU visitor lot next door. You can park there and as long as you take less than 15mins. it's free.

The food is delicious. It's fresh made and the ingredients are top quality. I always get the #3 Mozzarella Salad + Grilled Chicken and Spring Greens. 

The space is small but they make good use of it and have a fairly structured line. The overall cost varies based on what you are getting. My average lunch runs about $12. You can easily get something much less expensive or more expensive. 

I know you are wondering why I gave them 3 stars. In my experience ... every time I have ordered in person or called in, there is something off about my order. Usually phone orders are worse. Today for example ... I called in an order for an office mate and I, and went to pick it up. Before getting off the phone I had the gentleman taking the order read it back to me. He had the orders correct, but when arriving to pick them up, he had made both salads identical to one another. Whoever made the salad completely missed the mark and didn't pay attention to my order. I saw the ticket and everything appeared to be correct on the order slip. I'm not sure what happened here ... 

My guess ... It does appear that many times things can be a bit chaotic behind the counter and the organization can be a bit lacking. I figure two separate employees worked on the order and became confused about which order they were to make. Additionally, the young man that rings you up is always confused but tries to be helpful. 

If BOG can work on their organization I'm certain the ordering issues would be fixed. 

With that said, the owner/manager is always eager to correct the issues and tries to make it right. My order was still not 100% correct today but I didn't realize this until it was too late and I was back at the office. 

I look forward to these issues getting smoothed out. I don't think the establishment has been open that long. And these issues won't keep me from coming back... I'll just keep checking behind them until I see the problems fixed over a consistent period of time. Once they do fix these issues, I look forward to editing my review!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner is incredibly friendly and it's a great place to grab a quick bite to eat downtown. The food is always fresh, delicious, and healthy. They deserve your business, so give them a shot!"}
{"text":"This place has great product and the food is fresh! I would recommend getting the house dressing with whatever salad you get because you won't find that anywhere else! It's so delicious and unique. The garlic sauce is on point as well! There's something for everyone from the vegan to the meat lover!"}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said, I keep on coming back and I really shouldn't. This place is one of the few healthy options walking distance from my work so I go. Where do I even start with this place. First off they over charge for everything. Anything they can charge you on they will. They are also forgetful and love to mess up your order. I do not recommend ordering online because they will for sure mess that up, be sure to watch them make everything to make sure you are getting what you actually ordered. I would say the WORST part about this place though is the manager. She is incredibly rude to all the customers and her staff. How does she still have a job here after all of the complaints? She is in the wrong industry, I say prison guard would be a better career choice for her."}
{"text":"While my initial visits could be influenced by its location across from my office, the great food, prices, and service have made me a regular customer. They have great salads, sandwiches, and other Mediterranean options. During a particularly busy lunch rush my order got momentarily lost in the shuffle; the owner got me my order immediately and gave a complimentary drink."}
{"text":"I had the roasted veggies salad.  It was tasty. Mostly spinach, could have used more roasted veggies.  For the price, I was expecting more.  The house dressing is very good. Had it been $6-7, I would have been happy.  Doubt I'd go back."}
{"text":"The Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and the Raspberry Avocado Salad are two of my favorite things to get here. The Raspberry Avocado is a good choice if you're looking for a lighter lunch, but passing up on their grilled chicken is hard for me to do. They have easily the best grilled chicken I've ever had from a place that uses a customizable restaurant format (similar to Chipotle's ordering format). 

If you go to the downtown location though, I recommend ordering online from about 11:30-1:30 because it gets slammed with ASU students and workers on lunch break."}
{"text":"I ordered a pita breakfast sandwich, scrambled eggs, spinach and cheddar cheese. The young woman that helped me, suggested a Buffalo sauce that was perfect. It was delicious! I also had a cup of chopped melon the was very fresh. I'll definitely be back. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I called in an order at 11:50am for a simple ceaser salad and was told that it would be ready in 10 minutes. at 12:15pm the order was not even started. People who walked into the restaurant got their food faster than I."}
{"text":"I seriously think we need more of these places in the world, especially on college campuses! {Where were they when I was in college?} I LOVE a good build-your-own salad bar! Bowl of Greens has so many topping options - even grilled cauliflower! They also make fresh juices, pita chips, and more. Their flavored iced tea options were also fab! I would highly recommend stopping into Bowl of Greens if you're looking for a quick + healthy bite and are near the ASU Downtown campus!"}
{"text":"Healthy, fast, fresh and friendly owners. Lunch was affordable and delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Ridiculously inexpensive.  Love all of their roasted veggies, chicken, hummus and eggpant wraps.  Excellent breakfast as well.  All fresh, healthy and cheap!!! Owner is so friendly and knowledgeable as well.  He will give you samples of things.  And its always wonderful. :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat downtown during school. Their salads are huge and super affordable. One with chicken is only $7. They also make smoothies that are all fruit for $5. The people that work there are super friendly and are always quick to give you their recommendations. It's in a great location and is very accessible for students. Because of that and the great food and prices, I will definitely be coming back here often during the semester."}
{"text":"I came here out of town and had the 4. BOG Felix Pita for breakfast. Omg was that delicious! It was perfect. Came back again for some more."}
{"text":"Excellent healthy juices and greens!   We hope this chain grows and heads to Southern California soon!"}
{"text":"I had the BOG pita breakfast sandwich. It was very good, and not greasy at all. I thought the price was very reasonable too. To the young blonde woman working at the register...SMILE!! At least pretend to like your job."}
{"text":"Great chicken & hummus wrap! Love the pita chips that comes with it. They have to change their hours of operation to be accurate. Once I went when it said they were opened but they weren't."}
{"text":"Being one of very few spots that seems to cater to people who want to eat a salad; with the competition being places like Whole Foods and AJ's salad bars, you've got to give this place their just desserts. (hah, if only I could just get desserts right now, that would be awesome.)

I'm kind of glad I didn't review this place my first time through a year or so ago. I didn't quite put together the tastiest of salads that time through, but I decided I'd give them another try, I have been watching my figure the last few weeks and this was just the type of spot I wanted for lunch. I threw together a salad with spinach and mixed greens, popped on some jalepenos, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, sun dried tomatos, grilled chicken and topped (lightly) with their house dressing. My combination of veggies and dressing was good this time around and everything tasted fresh, just the way a salad should. No pre made mixtures sitting all day here.

Not exactly a build it yourself, but you tell em what you want, they throw it together, then they toss your salad and away you go. They've got some tasty (looking, all I was here for was a salad) Mediterranean food available too, dolma, falafel, etc. I was feening for some of that delicious looking grilled (or fried, not sure exactly) cauliflower, but I stuck to just a salad this time around. Oh grilled cauliflower, you will be mine, oh yes, you will be mine. I guess I'll have to update my review after I finally come back around for you.

They had a smoothie bar there too; I didn't partake, with a bunch of fresh fruits and juices at their disposal. I imagine it's kinda hard to mess up a smoothly too badly.

They're located in the ASU downtown campus building at Fillmore and Central avenue; no need to enter the building, find em on the Central ave side. Parking isn't terrible for those of you who are driving down here. Find a metered spot, spend the $1.50 for the hour and enjoy your lunch. Hey, these meters accept cards now!

Happy Yelping Phoenix, enjoy your freshly tossed salad ;-)"}
{"text":"I love their food but and the staff are usually friendly. The manager (im assuming she is the manager because she is always telling employees what to do) is awful! I'm not sure how she works in customer service. She yells at her employees, customers, and obviously cannot handle the lunch hour rush. I never catch her name but her attitude is really off the wall. When she isn't there I never have issues. I've never seen a manager yell so much (older woman with glasses)."}
{"text":"Not just greens thank goodness. When my wife suggested this place I thought I was going to have to take one for the team. Luckily they have a Mediterranean menu that includes greens, lamb and pita pizza for the kids. The lamb sandwich is awesome, babaganoush is great and the kid ate all his Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"It is nice to have a place within walking distance of my office for fresh and healthy food. I have had the the grilled chicken pita sandwich which is outstanding. The grilled salmon salad with red peppers and the house dressing is very good also. The prices are very reasonable and it does not take long to get your food. 

A very nice change of pace to the normal lunch options."}
{"text":"Well, I work right here and if you want something fresh, healthy, made to order and delicious...this is the spot. I just found out about the discount, so I will be using that. But I have had no complaints and the staff has always been friendly and willing to make it to order, even if it is out of the norm."}
{"text":"Tastes like disappointment. I've been trying to find a good salad place ever since Market Bistro closed and had high hopes for this place. 

I ordered the \"build your own\" salad which comes with a choice of 4 veggies and charges extra for things like cheese, nuts/seeds, and any kind of protein. If you truly love vegetables, 4 isn't enough. Even if it is, the anemic, tiny little portions of each veggie your order is barely enough to bring the size of the salad up to the equivalent of a side salad at a sit down restaurant. As a meal, this salad is a serious failure. 

My $9 salad included:
About 1.5 cups of spring mix lettuce
5 small broccoli florettes
4 small slices of carrot
5 thin slices of red bell pepper
5 thin slices of mushroom
About a teaspoon of feta cheese @ $.75
About 2 oz of grilled chicken @ $2 
Balsamic vinaigrette that tasted like it was loaded with sugar......seriously, who adds sugar to balsamic vinaigrette? Red wine vinaigrette I can understand, but balsamic is supposed to be acidic!

So, not a great value for an assembly line type fast food place. My \"healthy\" lunch has sent me searching for a vending machine."}
{"text":"They have amazing juices I was introduced by juices from J aay and I love the body cleanser I come in all the time for the Energizer and when it's lunch time chicken Caesar salad or a hummus sandwich is what I get awesome place love it"}
{"text":"Best hummus hands dwn! My girl and I came in today and had a Falafel sandwich awesome and hummus with pita bread."}
{"text":"I gave this place 1 star because they charge $1.00 or more at their Scottsdale location than their Phoenix location.  Their salads are ok but there are other salad places within a mile or two and their salads are just as good."}
{"text":"Had a hummus wrap and a juice. Both were great. The wrap inspired me to make one at home the next day!

I like how they have lots of veggie options that you can use to basically build your own. 

They do charge .50 per options but let you know that before you start adding on a lot of stuff:)"}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale location twice and had the same experience both times. The food is fabulous. The service is so sub par I will likely not return. I dined in any watched the staff for 20-30 minutes and saw one smile given to one customer. The lack of personality that the 5 employees displayed was unfortunate. I will support businesses that appreciate my dollars in the future."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times for smoothies and was excited to come back for food. Upon walking in the employees told us they closed early today. There was no sign up, the doors were wide open and it was 3:30 on a Saturday. Very disappointed to have driven across town just to be turned away. Horrible and inconsistent customer experience!"}
{"text":"Everyone has to try the baked cauliflower. I'm not a huge cauliflower guy until I had theres; it's phenomenal. This place is the healthiest fast food available. The grilled chicken or grilled salmon with veggies will leave you and your health wanting more. I Highly recommend if you want something quick and healthy."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time last week, while in downtown Phoenix. First impression is the restaurant was very clean and neat. The dining area had a wonderful view of downtown via large clean windows all around. The staff was friendly and helpful. I had the Chicken Kabob. The portion was larger than I'd expected and the flavor was even better. Chicken was moist, not overcooked and not dry. Well seasoned and matched perfectly with the bed of Mediterranean rice it was placed on. The accompanying salad had a surprising amount of balsamic vinegar which went very well with the roasted peppers and tomatoes in the green leafy salad. The juice bar on the far side of the restaurant made me a wonderful carrot, apple and orange juice drink that was so delicious, even my picky 6yr old devoured! What a wonderful delight to find this gem in the heart of Phoenix! This is a must for anyone traveling through Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service and surprisingly came all from the manager! The other workers seemed fine. Very unprofessional and just seemed like a mess in there. I got called in for a interview and had me sit and wait for over 40 mins, meanwhile the manager never said one word to me while waiting. I went up to ask if it's better I come another time, but the manager saw me standing and never said a word. So I left. After all that I wouldn't want to work there anyways.."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more starts but I had to major problems with them 
1. They are selling fresh drinks and the receipt show celery and lemon and carrots so they put 0.00001 lemon and celery and the rest carrots ( if I want carrots juice I would order that ) 
2. They are wayyyyyy over prices 
They charge almost $9 for a drink 
This place is Trendy and very nice 
They are in good location and they have a nice team 
They work very fast and always smile"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to open in my neighborhood. The salads are fantastic, and every additional item I try from the surprisingly extensive menu has been really good. Smoothies, yes; very good. Roasted veggies; excellent. I plan to keep working my way through the menu, even the breakfast items. The place is very bright and clean, and the staff is very nice. My one criticism is that some staff members are a little stingy with the salad ingredients, even the greens. But I ask for more, and they comply. Five stars for sure."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to lunch spot.  The salad toppings are always fresh and varied, the falafel is great and the prices can't be beat for a healthy, quick meal.  The staff is super friendly, too!  They usually have samples of their yummy smoothies out on the counter for customers to try which is a nice touch while you're paying your bill."}
{"text":"I love me some veggies!

As a downtown ASU student I seem to always be in a hurry, and thankfully Bowl of Greens has saved me from starvation on multiple occasions. It's conveniently located right next to the Croknite building. My favorite from them are their juices. They have a large selection of different veggies and fruits to choose from. I've also tried their oven roasted veggies, chicken, and grilled red peppers...so delicious! On top of all the options that they offer, the owner is exceptionally nice and always very courteous."}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the linguine with mussels along with a salad.  The sauce made by the owner is excellent.  Great flavors, texture and spices.  Cooked just right.  Salad included on the side includes choice of items.  The salad dressing recommended was very good.  Wife had eggplant parmesan over pasta.  She enjoyed it so much that she ate it all! Owner was excellent at recommending choices and has good follow up to make sure the meal is right.  You have to try Bowl of Greens!"}
{"text":"First time to bowl of greens was a welcome surprise. Fresh quality healthy food options at a reasonable price. The owner is attentive and friendly. He wanted our experience to be a great one. It was!!
If you choose a salmon protein add on it is a sizable portion and was cooked to perfection. Can't wait to return to try more wonderful options. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is super clean . I created my own salad which I thought I would screw up but  to my surprise it was really good . I will definitely go back service was good and low key . Sometimes places try to hard where it is annoying . plus they had stevia for a sweetener .Owner was working . Apparently they are opening another location .I can see why ! Plus it was appropriately priced .People always tend to complain about prices .As a small business owner some people don't know the cost of having quality products ."}
{"text":"Bleach, awful. Thank goodness I had a coupon or I'd really be disappointed. Just horrible food, all the way around. The lamb skwere was fatty and inedible, med. platter was terrible (except hummus was good, but seriously, I can make that at home) overall just seemed like a barely stitched together operation with no one knowing which end was up. I doubt they will be in Scottsdale long. If the food was good, I would think twice, but it isn't."}
{"text":"It's a great stop for juices, salads and all around healthy meals. They have more then greens like kabobs. 
I have been 5x and the service is great. It's on the high side of price but they use fresh veg not processed bagged veg like others nearby. 

Healthy isn't supposed to be cheaper. McDonald's is cheap.

The salmon and chicken dishes are really good"}
{"text":"It's a fast and decent option for lunch. As others have stated the lunch options at downtown asu are limited. The service is just okay, the prices are way too high for what it is, and the portions are quite small for what you pay. 
The food itself is fine, no complaints but not really the best I've had"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the worst establishments I have ever been to. The two girls working there this morning had absolutely no clue how to provide customer service. We were ignored for about 10 minutes, just standing in front of the counter, before we had to ask whether we could order. Then, she told us to hang on because she couldn't hear us, as she was blending a drink. Then, I ordered a green drink, and requested a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, and the girl had no idea what that was even though it was sitting on the counter in front of her face. And I ended up getting charged a dollar extra for that. The juice ended up being so spicy it was undrinkable. She must have poured cayenne pepper into it. $750 for a 16 ounce green juice is ridiculous. By the way, this is not cold pressed, it's just simply blended. The service here is horrendous--somebody please train these girls. This place won't be here long."}
{"text":"I had \"make your own salad\". I'm looking forward to coming back to try several other items on the menu. It all looks delicious. They make healthy fresh smoothies. The serve breakfast also."}
{"text":"The food is great!  My favorite is the chicken kabob and I got everyone from work loving this kabob meal.  It does take about 10 to 15 minutes but it's worth it.  I also love their chicken Caesar Salad...I eat Ira out once or twice a week"}
{"text":"My wife is a health nut and I'm not but we both really enjoyed the food here!  Great flavor and selection.  We will be back to try their all day breakfast too.  Love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"The salad ingredients are fresh and the roasted veggies are pretty good.  While there are some good healthy choices and a juice bar, there are some issues that need to be addressed such as the efficiency of service, employees' understanding the menu, and pricing of certain items.  They seem to have a bit of a \"nickle and dime\" mentality, which isn't the greatest business model especially for a new restaurant that people are experiencing for the first time."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasteful. Service was on point. I was asked if it was my first time there and offered numerous food samples. Place was clean and you could see all fresh produce on display. 

It was my first time and I enjoyed it. I will be back soon. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place was really good! It's right on the ASU Downtown campus, so very convenient. I ordered the Chicken Entree with a side of hummus. It came with chopped chicken, basmati rice, cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots. With a drink, the cost was $12.00. Everything was fresh and the veggies had really good seasoning. Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"I go here every day I have class on Downtown ASU Campus.  ALOT of healthy items to choose from including pita pizza with anything you want on it! Right now I'm stuck on a combination of salad greens with jalape√±os and grilled chicken.  Good Price for the quality, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"The spinach and avocado salad was delicious but tiny! They were out of strawberries, no problem because they had a wide selection. Adding chicken was 2.00$  sum total of 11$ and some change. For that price I wish my salad was double the size. I'm still HANGRY Bowl of Greens"}
{"text":"This place is fun, and very tasty. 

I was tempted by a few menu items, such as a veggie wrap or Mediterranean dish. Although I chose the option of getting my salad on a pita, aka \"pizza\", which was a great choice.

Then I had a side order of hummus. I would have liked if it had come with more than just one fairly small pita. When I asked for more, I was invited to pay $1 for another one. The hummus was excellent. The pizza was very good.

The staff was outgoing, friendly and provided very good service.

Also, this may be trivial to most, although the beverage options do matter to me. I didn't get a smoothie, I got the drinking fountain beverage. It had Cherry Coke, my favorite. And I think it was a ginger Fanta, maybe. That was actually very good, whatever it was. And the tea was good, too.

This would be an easy place for me to choose, anytime I wanted to get something I know I would enjoy, and it would be a fun atmosphere to have a nice meal."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and after looking at all the pictures, I knew I had to stop here.  We ordered 3 plates. As soon as we walked in, they offered us a sample of the cauliflower and explained a few dishes to us.  My daughter ordered a salad that she loved.  My boyfriend and I got the grilled chicken plate with rice and veggies.  They were kind enough to let me substitute the sweet potatoes with extra cauliflower.  My daughter also ordered a smoothie.  She brought us little samples to taste it.  It was really good.  The portions are huge and we ended up having left overs even after feeding some chicken to my little puppy.  The flavor was on point, decent portion sizes and price is reasonable.  The best middle eastern food i have tried so far."}
{"text":"Love this place!! One of my go-to's for a quick healthy meal and juice. Clean and great customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the greek salad and the house dressing was amazing. I will definitely order this again. My husband made his own salad & loved it! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm on a mission to try all of the juice bars in the area and see how they stack up against each other! I'd say that while Bowl of Greens wasn't the worst, it wasn't the best either. I wasn't super impressed, but also wasn't totally dissatisfied.
They had a note up explaining that the staff was still learning so that was a good heads up. They did a good job for being new, but I didn't feel welcomed. They were talking to each other, took my order pretty quickly but didn't talk to me at all which was a tad disappointing as I was the only customer in there at the time. Also I didn't really like how it looked inside, but that's just my personal preference, it doesn't matter, the things they serve are most important!
My favorite thing about Bowls of Greens is was that you could see them juicing the vegetables. I would've liked to see more variety in the juices though. I went for the bone strengthening one which was carrot, ginger, kale, and apple. I could pretty much only taste the carrot and the ginger. I wish they would've offered it over ice too, tasted much better after I refrigerated it. But everything was fresh and not too terribly expensive so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My only complaint is that its technically within walking distance from work for me.. but NOT in the summer, and parking stinks. So, I would probably go here every day if it were winter.

It is a bit too expensive. A salad comes out to just 2 or 3 dollars more than I feel is fair, but there isn't anything else like it in the area so I guess they have a monopoly.

And their \"house\" balsamic is to die for. Whatever spices/herbs they mix in make it the best I have ever tasted. 

And they have pepitas as a topping which is great. It's not worth the 75 cents extra, especially considering its not a perishable product so the upcharge is pretty ridiculous. 

So, if you don't mind paying a bit extra and finding a street parking space or walking in the summer heat, the food itself is delicious and the hummus is nice."}
{"text":"I was referred here and was told the salad portions were big. However when I finally opened the box I found that the portions were very light. I doubt I will return after making my first visit here today. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"As the only truly healthy option in downtown Phoenix I have to give them props. They have a lot of fresh ingredients to build your own salad. They also have warm Mediterranean dishes and a few Italian options as well, in addition to smoothies.

The staff are very nice and I will say that they place nice, relaxing music for all us stressed out students.

It is a bit on the pricey side and it occurs to me that I could put together the same thing if I weren't so lazy.

That said, it's nice to have a healthy option downtown."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last week and it's safe to say I'm officially obsessed! 

Here's my long list of reasons why:
-FRESH INGREDIENTS
-Super friendly and helpful staff 
-Reasonably priced menu items
-Great menu selection
-Easy to customize
-Super healthy ingredients and options 
-Indulgence is still available
-Beautiful interior, impeccably clean
-Consistent quality

It's hard to hit all of those marks every single time but I've yet to be disappointed. Stop by for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a healthy snack and you'll be hooked too."}
{"text":"I always go to this place and my loyalty to them has been great I love their food, Today my chicken was not cooked well and I attempted to contact them in regards to my concern of chicken not being well cooked and every phone call was placed on hold greater then 3mins. Very disappointed on the food especially when u love it. My meals are never under $9 bucks and I feel maybe correcting and taken proper actions is needed."}
{"text":"It's very difficult to find quick healthy food that is not overpriced in this area. I have tried to get away from this place on several occasions due to their inconsistent salads and service. Their chef for the hot food is excellent but the salads are really hit or miss depending on who you get. I have friends that won't come here anymore due to the amount of screw ups with orders, salads, etc. When they get it right, the food is good, you just have to stay on them to ensure your salad is made properly."}
{"text":"Not happy with the salmon bowls, both were over cooked and tasteless. Too much dressing and boring flavor. My grilled veggies had only  two yet 3 were on display. The  cauliflower was tasty but not once mixed with the yuk sauce. It all was on a bed of spinach which I can't eat. 

No one else was in the store so no rush yet service could've been more attentive especially since I mentioned it was my first visit.

Too many other places to enjoy."}
{"text":"I ordered through yelp and paid for avocado and got none /: so make sure that you check your food before you take it!! they weren't busy so i don't really know why they would mess up on my order, there was literally one other person in the restaurant so it shouldn't be that hard to get an online order right especially when everything is written down for you."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have amazing salads but their entrees are very  good! 

Look...! For a quick meal on your way home that's healthy and delicious .... Bowl of Greens is the place to go....

This place is a tucked in the corner of the Promenade mall.... As you walk in to the right they have a smoothie station.... There signature smoothie is so Melon mango... Yep... So good! 

You can also order salads made go with whatever you want... It's a great alternative to the box salads  you get in McDonald's or mall food.... Yuck!!! 

I ordered the jasmine rice, grilled shrimp, grilled veggies that came with a side salad....This was $10.... Just up my alley.... The rice was fluffy and had a hint of curry... Love this rice.  The shrimp was made to order. Definitely worth the 7 min wait! 

Try it you wouldn't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the area for a healthy yet tasty meal...
This is not your regular salad place, it's a lot more than that... the owner is highly dedicated and passionate about good food service and great food. He brings in authentic middle eastern dishes with healthy American and Italian twists. I have never walked out disappointed.

I am vegan and I always find great Vegan optics here..

The hummus is one of best and most authentic I have tried in Phoenix/ Scottsdale area. He makes it fresh everyday..

Oh yeah and thy have an amazing fresh juice bar which is a big plus :)"}
{"text":"I ordered here for pickup on the Yelp at for the first time and was super easy. The grilled chicken bowl with rice and veggies is what I got and will probably just get it again next time I go, it was so good!! Friendly service and easy location to get in and out."}
{"text":"Never friendly customer service. Seems like they are always pissy to take your order. The food is always average tasting, but should be above average as it's expensive. Today's visit is definitely the last time we will ever be in, super disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and fresh. Customer service is outstanding and the owner is very friendly! He is aware of his customers and checks in to make sure everything is okay. Wide variety of dishes and love that they have a juice bar. I love their falafel!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately working downtown, lunch options are limited. I used to go to Bowl of Greens quite often because I enjoyed their salads. However, with the recent increase in prices and decrease in customer service, I was quickly reminded today why I stopped coming here. The staff's salty attitudes left a bad taste in my mouth. I will certainly think twice before returning."}
{"text":"Today was our first experience at Bowl of Greens.  My wife and I were looking for something different and read the good reviews.

My wife ordered the make your own salad with chicken.  It was okay, at best, but the chicken was dry.

I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich.  The veggies were okay but there wasn't much flavor.  The pita, that the veggies came in, was stale.  Yes, stale.  And, the guy who made the sandwich was having difficulty opening up the pita and tore it. Instead of getting me an untorn pita, he served the torn one to me. Needless to say, everything was falling out of the sandwich.  It didn't matter, however, because I couldn't eat the state pita so I just ate the veggies.  The chips were not made in the store. They were commercial chips, very oily and tasteless. 

Halfway through lunch, they turned on the music.  At first, it was pretty mellow - nice for lunch. Then it turned to rap.  Sorry, but that was simply out of place when you look at the demographics of the customers in the restaurant.  And, it was a little loud. 

Maybe we caught an off day, but it wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin oh yeah.. the food is a total  joke cold pre-made and over priced. ..its sad to take advantage of students knowing that they are on a budget and then offering  poor quality if you want to call it food I've had fresher food at Costco food court not to mention the abdominal cramping for hours after.. do not waste your time and save your money I never Bash a place  but man! I really believe that their days are numbered. Customer service was really bad and slow ..making faces if you ask a question staring at you when you eat I wish I could say something good about this place I am really trying but I can't find anything....."}
{"text":"Food was fresh. Servers were extremely friendly and helpful. I had the roasted veggie salad with chicken and the house dressing. Fantastic! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have deteriorated the service. I have been at this location several times and past two times I've experienced bad service and cold servers. For $10 salad the quantity that they serve is very less.  This eatery just lost a customer and few others when the word spreads."}
{"text":"$8.25+tax Mediterranean platter. Thoroughly disappointed with the busted open, crusty grape leaf and the packaging of the greasy falafel. Always skimpy on their low quality ingredients. During this visit, the same tongs that are used for cheese also got used for vegetables. Last time I was here, the avocado was browning and I over paid for shrimp (2 for $3 last time). I like that there is supposedly this restaurant as a \"healthy\" option on campus, but I am a college student and expect my dollar to go further than measly servings. Sorry :/ wanted to love it"}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place open and thought it would be great have another lunch spot in the area. The experience was disappointing.

As others have mentioned, they really do nickel and dime you. I was originally planning to get the $11 grilled shrimp plate, and when I asked if I could substitute the rice with veggies, they said that there would be a $2 charge. Come on...are veggies really THAT much more expensive? Just substitute it! This is not a way to do business. I wasn't going to pay $13 for shrimp and veggies from a walk-up-to-the-counter place!

I thought I would go with the cheaper $10 grilled shrimp salad. I asked for dressing on the side, but when I got my order, the dressing was mixed in; they also forgot to add the roasted peppers. The most ridiculous part was, it came with THREE SMALL shrimps; the bulk of it was spring mix. I spoke with the lady that put my order together and she confirmed that the salad does only come with three shrimps, but that she would remake the salad without the dressing. 

The lady was friendly and the manager checked up on me at some point, but that was the only positive part of my visit. The salad was boring and unsatisfying. For that price, they could at least add avocado, an egg, or something more filling....perhaps more shrimp?

I hope they get their act together. For now, be prepared to spend a good amount of money and leave hungry. I am sure they are making a whopping profit!"}
{"text":"We came here after coming off a long trip from MN, and we were VERY glad we did! I believe the manager guided us to what we should have for our meal, and he made the food look beautiful on our plates. Not only that, but it tasted fresh and phenomenal! Thank you for a great experience here. We'll be back again when we come to visit again!"}
{"text":"I've only had the chicken Caesar salad here and boyyyyy it is tasty! The chicken is so perfectly seasoned and it also comes with these pita chips mixed in. It's comes out a little more than $8 but it's a nice portion, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great service and quality food! Definitely recommend Bowl of Green! I've eaten here many times and the quality is consistent."}
{"text":"I'm super disappointed with my first (and last) visit here. I have severe allergies to multiple items and the girl who made my salad was uncooperative and didn't offer to look into any ingredients to accommodate? me. Another employee raised his arms in annoyance after my SO asked basic questions about the menu. They all looked like they hated their jobs and didn't want to be there. How hard is it to fake a smile and pretend like you care? I've worked in customer service for over five years and I have never been this tempted to walk out of an establishment until now. The only employee who actually had a smile was the man who worked the juice counter. Everyone else (manager included) seemed like we were just inconveniencing them. There are too many salad places in Scottsdale for it to ever be worth visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch and dinner today because it was so delicious! For lunch I had the Greek or Mediterranean salad (I can't remember the actual name) and I had them add chicken. It had romaine lettuce, other veggies, feta, and a house made vinaigrette that was too die for. The portion was huge but I ate it all because it was that good! 
My second trip for dinner today I ordered the \"make your own\" salad. You pick the greens, 4 toppings, and your dressing. Proteins and some other special toppings are a extra charge. This time I ordered a side of roasted vegetables with my order. They are roasted in EVOO and rosemary and they are also delicious. I enjoyed this salad as well. 
To wrap it all up I would say that all of the offerings looked and tasted fresh. Good variety of toppings. The chicken was moist and perfectly grilled and the house dressing just finished the product perfectly. Super healthy option at a reasonable price. I think I paid $9-10 each visit."}
{"text":"First time here I ordered the chicken kabob entree.  The service was very slow, not sure if it was just a bad day for them but I was waiting a pretty long time for my order.  The food was excellent though so I am willing to give it another go around!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
We ordered a team lunch here for pick-up and everyone enjoyed the food It seemed to have made it all accurately. 

THE BAD:
The reason I took off three stars is because not only was the staff was cold and standoffish, the manager was SO rude! I went up to the counter to pick up the order and a couple team members (who were standing around doing nothing) just stared over at me like, \"Uhh what do you want?\" No, \"Can I help you with something?\" or \"Are you here for a pick-up order?\" Just stares. 

I was picking up the order for someone else from my team so I wasn't sure what name it was under. I tried our business name first and they asked annoyed, \"You mean (NAME)?\" Sidebar: I'm guessing ours was the only group order. They could have just asked, \"Is it possibly under (NAME) instead?\"

Then, the manager walked by with a black crate, which I actually didn't realize it was for me because she passed right by me at the counter without looking over or acknowledging me at all. She set down the crate on a table behind me and it was then that I realized she wasn't restocking something or bringing a random crate to the trash. (How would I know? She didn't even make eye contact with me.) I turned around and asked, \"Is that my order?\" She just stared at me, annoyed, like \"Obviously, you idiot,\" and didn't say a word. I walked up to her and she repeated over and over how many times she checked the order, so basically, \"It's all there. Don't double-check my work, just leave.\"

Unless my team orders here again, I wouldn't come back. Rude staff is a huge turn-off. I'll go spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Bowl of Greens is a great spot for a quick bite if you are downtown. I eat here at least once a week. They have several vegan options. My usual go to is the hummus - which is now thankfully at the register so I don't have to wait in what is usually a long lunch line for it. It's pretty good hummus - usually smooth and fresh. 

I also like the saffron rice. It has a lot of flavor and stands alone just fine. Sometime I get a side of falafel but they are hit or miss. Quite often they taste like the oil they were fried in is old. I frequently get a side of rice and side of veggies for a colleague. She likes it a lot. It should be on the menu as an entree!

I would really like it if they marked items as vegan and considered having more vegan options - especially for breakfast. A small side salad would be nice too. Sometimes I just don't want a $7 salad! 

The restaurant is small and gets very crowded at lunch. They crew moves the line quickly though. In short - it's a convenient vegan option downtown but not destination dining."}
{"text":"Outstanding! First time there, believe the owner made our juice drink. Was delicious! Customer service was amazing! One of my new favorite stops!"}
{"text":"Some days you want a salad made the way you want...so this place sounded like a great idea...twice, five if you count the times i walked out after waiting in line for 10 minutes! Not are they always understaffed...that should say something...but it doesn't help that their manager is always scolding and berating the employees, stressing them out and causung more errors and a general sense off tension the entire time.  But the salad ends up being a soup with the excess dressing (after requesting light) and costing over $8 for a mediocre side salad...without a drink. Not going back after i made a comment to an employee about being sorry they got treated that way and the manager decided he could yell at me as well.  I'll walk down the street where i can make my own salad at Greens and actually find a seat and enjoy lunch."}
{"text":"Hit the spot! I'm grateful anytime I can find a place that serves healthy green salads at a reasonable size and a reasonable price. Bowl of Greens is great in its simplicity - just good, fresh ingredients that you can order in combos from the menu or in a build-your-own salad.  Friendly ownership, too! And the other Yelpers were right - their house dressing is delish."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Been coming here since day 1. Great place for lunch or dinner. I've had almost everything in the menu but try the roasted veggies and chicken Marsala. You won't regret it. The salads and smoothies are delicious too. The owner is awesome, talks to customers, and  always works hard, which I appreciate. Overall 10/10."}
{"text":"Love this place hope to see more through the valley.  I can walk in and get one dish and be happy and satisfied through the day.  I really like this place"}
{"text":"This place offers GREAT options. I ate a hot paleo meal here today! It was great. I would take a picture, but I ate it up pretty quick!
The staff is super friendly too. The owner stopped by our table today to check in on us.
Please open one in Chandler/Mesa!"}
{"text":"My Mom, Aunt, and I came here for the first time last week by accident and it was a great surprise!!! The employees are very helpful and patient. I've gotten the veggie sandwich and a salad and their house dressing is to die for!! Also they have a very wide range of fruits for juicing. 10/10 obsessed with this place. Will definitely be returning regularly!! :)"}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW.  I was at the Verizon store getting my phone fixed & one of the reps there suggested that I try this spot, I was skeptical at first... I am not a health guru & I was worried I wouldn't like the food.  The staff there was so accommodating, friendly & delightful!  They gave me samples of things I would normally never try & I was blown away!  My pallet has literally been opened up & I don't care how cheesy that sounds.  I highly recommend eating here!!!  The owner is so pleasant & made everything on the menu (his own recipes). The prices are extremely reasonable and they make sure you leave with a smile on your face. Honestly even if the food wasn't amazing (which it is) I would still go back for the customer service!  This is definitely on the top of my list for good quality healthy food for a reasonable price. Being a mom of a toddler it's hard to find good food that we can grab on the go so I can't wait to take my fianc√© & my daughter here!"}
{"text":"Not a very good choice. Chicken is dry and seems more a trendy place than actually having good food."}
{"text":"We are tourists here in Scottsdale.  We have now been to this wonderful restaurant two times in two days.  Wonderful, healthy food!  I requested just a chicken breast or a piece of salmon with steamed veggies.  They complied both times!  Wonderful service and food.  My husband had the chicken parmesan sandwich and said it was great, too.  He also ordered one of their delicious smoothies and loved that, too.  Very accommodating and nice place to go.  They have a large, wonderful choice of healthy items on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is so great! The atmosphere is fun and friendly, very clean, and the staff is so efficient! I think the owner or manager helped me and he was so helpful and nice. The food isn't just healthy, it's super delicious! And they have cookies for a good balance, haha. :)"}
{"text":"First time - deluxe pita with chicken and berry blast smoothie. I'm not a fan of pita chips that comes with the burrito. But both items I ordered were great."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh. There are many options on the menu. I got a salad and my mother got the roasted cauliflower. Both were really great. Jay is so sweet! Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love the smoothies at this place!  But they don't just have smoothies and juices, they have a large selection of healthy salad options!  I personally love how they have coconut water or almond milk to add to smoothies along with various protein options.  The place is very clean.  I don't generally like using public restrooms, but the restrooms here are always VERY clean.  Importantly, the people who work at Bowl of Greens are all very friendly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars as they don't have \"kid friendly\" smoothie flavors for young children who aren't big fans of fruit.  A chocolate flavor would be fantastic for the \"kids.\"   As a mom, it's nice to go to one place that makes everyone happy.

All in all - If you haven't tried it - you should!"}
{"text":"Bowl of greens is the best salad place in the valley and beyond. The owner is the nicest of gentleman, and the food can't be beat. The chicken is so good, and well cooked. The veggies are all fresh and crisp. The juices and smoothies are to die for, and -all this from a girl who doesn't even eat veggies."}
{"text":"So I have been here a few times before. As we walked in a nice lady asks us what we would like. As we start one of the manager interrupts the lady and says to go get a pen and write it down. Totally berated her employee right in front of us. When I received my food I asked for a side of sriracha. That same manager said \"Please next time ask for it with your food so I can charge you\". I thought she was kidding. That being said we won't be back at all. Plenty other places to eat in the area.\"No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.\""}
{"text":"I am really not a fan of this place. I am student at the Cronkite School that this restaurant is attached to. I find that the majority of the food is is under seasoned and not fresh at all. I have had to order food here on a couple of occasions because the only other viable option is Subway which is awful. Often times I will order the falafel because it is one of the least expensive items. The falafel tastes like it was pre-prepared or frozen before it makes it out the the warming trays. The falafel is grainy and bitter, which I understand is what falafel is but this just does not hit the spot for me. I will say that their smoothie bar is actually pretty good but they charge extra for Kale which is a little moronic if you ask me because Kale is probably the least expensive produce item at the bar.  That being said their hummus and babaganoush are really solid. Avoid the chicken dishes because they are sitting under heatlamps all day."}
{"text":"This place has great salads! Try the house dressing and the fresh pita chips they are addicting like crack! The girls at work and I call this place crack salad. The salads so fresh and made the way you want them the add pita chips to the top for some crunch for free! Try it once you will love it. Plus, the people that work there are real nice and competent!!!!"}
{"text":"Bowl of greens was fast, tasty, and satisfying for two visiting friends and myself. I wish I knew about it sooner."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the most welcoming staff, even when busy. The owner is amazing!!! I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Everything is so fresh. I had the falafel sandwich which was amazing and my husband had the salmon entree. He loved his meal as well. So many options to build your own salad and you can also have fresh squeezed juice made with your choice I ingredients. So much better than many if the other \"fast\" food places downtown. I highly recommend Bowl of Greens and will be back again and again. Owner and staff are  wonderful and very friendly."}
{"text":"I found a hair in my veggie pita in the first bite. I called to get a refund and the owner was angry when I told him we threw our food away. He offered to give a refund after a bit of arguingredients over the phone."}
{"text":"Meh.. 
The first time we came here we had the chicken kabobs. They were good, but took a long time to be prepared. Because we were short on time for our second visit, we ordered the falafel sandwich, veggie sandwich and chicken parm entree. All were a waste of money and something I could have made at home and I probably would have enjoyed it more. These dishes were plain and very dry. 

So many wonderful restaurants in the area, I don't think I'll be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful customer service. Employees were quick and efficient. Food was delicious and fresh. Inside of the restaurant was clean and the hotline smell delicious."}
{"text":"Ugh. I keep going back and I don't know why. 
Shrimp salad - good but really, 3 small shrimp for a $10 salad? No thanks.
Mozzarella and Tomato Salad - Thought since it was the same price as the other salads it would be the same size. Boy was I wrong. Paid $9 for a tiny tiny bowl of cheese and wilted basil with tomatoes that you had to end up cutting up to actually enjoy.
Decided to switch things up to steer away from disappointment and got the chicken mozzarella sandwich. What I got wasn't a sandwich, but a wrap, which I did not expect.
I thought \"ok, can't be so bad.\" I opened up the packaging, picked it up, went to take a bite, and the whole wrap completely deteriorated. I realized it was so mushy with dressing that it basically mushed and melted into the rest of the ingredients. It completely fell apart, and was absolutely disgusting and completely inedible. I am beyond pissed at wasting another $10 on this sandwich that I barely even enjoyed one bite of."}
{"text":"Stopped over to this place on lunch after reading some of the other reviews. Something about salads have got me hooked! I ordered the roasted veggie salad on spinach and let me tell you! Delicious ! The flavors in the veggies were impeccable! Will come back often!!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to have lunch and enjoy a healthy meal! 

I had the falafel wrap, and my tastebuds (and stomach) rejoiced!

A great place with friendly workers and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great spot! I eat here frequently because the food is so good. I pretty much always order the chicken ceasar salad. They have homemade croutons that totally make the salad. I have tried a few other dishes like the grilled chicken plate, grilled veggies etc. Great spot to stop in for lunch. Staff is always helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw this place! I used to eat at the downtown Phoenix location when I was going to classes at ASU there. The food is just as amazing as I remember it being and the juices are incredible and right in front of your eyes fresh. I am partial to the Energizer. If you haven't eaten here you should!"}
{"text":"Yum.. fast healthy yummy food.. great lunch spot.. 

On today's visit i had the chicken kabob entree with yellow rice and salad.. the chicken kabob was cooked to order (extra 10min to prepare but so worth it).. salad was dressed just right .. the rice went well with the kabob ..

Great place to grab a salad or smoothie for a lunch on the go.."}
{"text":"Great! Especially if you are on a diet and you want to pick your own salad.  Service is good.  Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"We walked in at 1:30 on a Saturday. There was one person in line in front of us and four employees. It took five minutes for another employee to acknowledge us. We finally got our food made about five minutes later. They were so slow! Next we waited to pay but the employees started to help the next two people in line. We waited 5 minutes to pay and they kept looking over at us but didn't do anything about us waiting. Next I ordered a smoothie but I knew that it would take some time because I watched the employee make another smoothing at a turtles place. I came back to the counter ten minutes later and  asked if my smoothie was ready. The employee asked me if t was the ticket that he had in his hand and it was. He hadn't even started making my smoothie. I asked for a refund because I had to leave and that took another five minutes. 

With the employees aside, the food was delicious and the place has lots of great healthy options. I really wish that the service had been better."}
{"text":"Food is good... but; there hours are very inconsistent, the service is below avaerage and they don't have Calories listed on anything there. When I called to ask if they had an estimate on the calories on a chicken Caesar, which is there most popular item, the owner jay was short and said they didn't calorie count. I expect that from McDonald's who has poor nutritional food choices but bowl of greens targets those people watching what they eat and those that want to eat high quality food. I go here all the time but am turned off but the lack of effort in the areas I listed."}
{"text":"Actually found this place on yelp which has never failed me, this place  has 4 stars and I'll use yelp agin but by-golly nothing is fresh here as far as the juice bar and the salad but besides that don't bother everything is on display and I should have listened to my gut telling me passssss as everything looked old I did try there juice bar and it was good very nice person behind the counter 
But I warn yu if yur not getting a salad or juice don't bother . There chicken, and yams (fries) and salmon all dry as a bone ."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars. First of all I just want to say, great staff. Friendly people who give good service and seem to care. My issues are with the product itself. I went in there to get lunch one day and ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and when I got it I was incredibly disappointed. For starters it was so small I finished in like 5 bites, and when paying $9 for a wrap I would like a little bit more than that. Secondly, the chicken was a little bit below room temperature and there were only like 4 little pieces on the wrap. Again, total ripoff for $9. If there is an option to get it toasted I wouldn't have known because I was never asked. Finally, my last problem is the pricing of juices and smoothies. Some of them are upwards of $7 just for a 16oz., and that is not including add-ons such as protein, which are between $1 and $2 each. I understand the issue that produce are expensive but come on! Some of the most expensive juices only had 4 ingredients in them! I could just as easily go to Nekter two minutes down the road and get a 24 oz. juice for that price, and all of their add-ons are only a dollar. 

Great staff, horrible product."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty filling
If you want a great healthy lunchtime escape with nice ambience then I recommend highly"}
{"text":"This was our first time here & from the moment we stepped in the door we were impressed. Jay, the owner and his staff greeted us with a friendly hello. Jay offered us samples of the chicken & of the roasted cauliflower which were both wonderful! My husband & I each had the Signature Greek Salads - I added chicken to mine & the hubby added some artichokes to his. The salad dressing on the greek salad is FABULOUS & they make it in-house. We HAD TO add a side of those roasted cauliflowers because they were so good! Definitely check out Bowl of Greens if you're in Scottsdale plus there is one in Phoenix. I'm hoping to see a location for us Westside folks soon   :)"}
{"text":"Salmon salad was not worth the price. Had to add stuff at home to it to make it substantial. Salmon was rubbery and tasted like it was out of the bag. Over priced."}
{"text":"No redeeming qualities to this place.  Very poor value for the price and there's nothing spectacular about the food quality that would make me want to come back either.  It's been 3 months and I haven't seen any meaningful improvements to the service, menu, or food quality.  I'll go back only if I'm in a jam and starving but with other choices in the area this isn't on my list."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, with delicious food that is prepared quickly!! Try the chicken Caesar wrap, you are welcome!!"}
{"text":"ACTUAL RATING: 3.5

Of the multitude of quick food joints surrounding the ASU journalism and law school building, Bowl of Greens is probably the best for your buck... provided you like salads. The sandwiches (which are actually wraps) and falafel leave a bit to be desired, particularly in portion size, and the menu/order areas can be a little confusing for new consumers. The lunch hour lines tend to be long, but service is speedy, and most of the staff behind the counter have been very polite to me.

I haven't witnessed the horrible manager described in other reviews, but it wouldn't surprise me. Lunch time is very chaotic everywhere downtown, and the multi-order areas here don't make the process much simpler."}
{"text":"To clarify my 5 star, the salads and food look and smell DELICIOUS! The shop itself is bright and nice to sit. I will go back to try some of their salads and other foods. Yesterday, I had the falafel sandwich...HORRIBLE! The \"tahini sauce\" was bland and unrecognizable and the falafel itself was just plain NASTY. Unless they are gassing these college students, my next visit, the food should be PRETTY tasty-?  College students know good food, too, right? Oh, the falafel was wrapped in an ice cold pita, unless I was dreaming, there is a big oven behind the food preparers-? But again, I will go back, the salads look superbly fresh and tasty.  Cute juice bar too!"}
{"text":"Location: great it's close to my work. 
Food: Delicious!! 
Wait Time: HORRIBLE, I place Togo orders. Almost every time I come in my order ain't ready...trust me when I say I wait more than 10-16mins to get my order & it ain't even ready. The time I get there, people are in line for their food, super frustrating I have to wait an additional 4-7 minutes for my meal."}
{"text":"Walked in to a pleasant Good Morning. 
Ordered a juice that was made perfect to my request.
Ordered breakfast which was delicious. 
The crew is helpful when ordering. Can't wait to come in and try a Salad or Entree."}
{"text":"I'll never waste my hard earned money on this @!*%$ place.  Cold. Hard gross falafel.  Stupid Eggplant parm sandwich.  Small gross cold food they throw in the oven.  Don't waste your money or time here. Pre-made over priced complete garbage.
To continue my bad lunch choice, bad stomach pains  (I will be contacting the health department) .  Un believable"}
{"text":"Walked in and was created by the smoothie juice guy. Super friendly staff. Recommended a smoothie after I asked for the most unpopular one.   What a recommendation!!!  Def will make this a must stop trip!!"}
{"text":"I came in during rush hour, noonish, AVOID AT ALL TIMES, with all the confusion, they completely missed my order and gave out around 8 burritos before they got to mine. Around 10 mins passed keeping in mind my friend was running late to class and still no order. Finally let them know and they begin the order, another 8 mins passed  until I got the burrito. Other than freshness the food is less than expected."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had a very lack-luster first experience here this past week. 

I work about a block away and was on the hunt for a healthy alternative to the norm that is found around the Arizona Center so I ventured here with a coworker.

I decided to go with the Caesar Salad and instead of having the grilled chicken that comes with it, asked for salmon instead. 

The first thing that seemed peculiar was that my total came to ~$12 (unfortunately, I did not keep the receipt). The Caesar with Grilled Chicken ($6.75) plus salmon ($3.00) should come to around $10 as I did not order a drink. I wait the 10 minutes or so for my number to called..I walk up to grab the salad, take a look down, and quickly realize this is definitely not the salad I ordered. I place it back up on the counter and tell the owner, \"this isn't my salad\" to which he snarkliy replies \"well that's why I called the number\". At this point, I'm thinking I made the mistake and heard the wrong number. I go back and sit patiently..awaiting what must be the most amazing caesar salad in the world, as it's been about 15 minutes at this point.

There's some commotion behind the counter and one of the workers comes out and notifies me that that was indeed the salad I ordered. Well no.. no it's not. My coworker verifies that I indeed said \"caesar salad with salmon\". I state that I must've been charged the $12 because they had the order wrong to which the worker says that the salmon I added on is $5, and not the $3 that's on the menu. 

No where on the menu does it say that salmon is $5 to add on. Nowhere. 

The worker tries to bargain with me.. stating that the wrong salad that was made is actually \"a better salad\" than the caesar I ordered. For what, price? value? quality? She states that because I ordered the caesar salad with salmon, that I implied I wanted the \"grilled salmon salad\" and that I should've made it more clear that I wanted the caesar salad and the salmon added on. What's the difference? At this point, the worker is making absolutely zero sense. 

They bring out the corrected salad, I eat most of it, and we leave (btw the salad tasted decent but that's a moot point).

 At no point was there a refund offered or an apology. Instead, I felt that I was treated rather rudely for bringing up logical questions about my meal that was screwed up and that I was overcharged for.

 Do I care about the $2? Not really. But it's the principle of it. This place had so much potential, but I'm not sure I will return after such a bad first impression in terms of service."}
{"text":"It was nice to get a glass of fresh pressed vegetable juice while in town on business. It's super, super busy at lunchtime but the staff are doing their best. 4 stars for having a headache chaser veg juice on the menu, it was a great treat in the dessert heat. The sit down table area was more casual that I expected, but just took my juice to go."}
{"text":"This place is healthy, delicious and quick! The owner is kind and truly cares about the quality of his food which is clear upon tasting it. He makes an effort to make sure you are 100 percent satisfied and always gives us samples and tea. Great healthy option and the portions are large! Definitely check it out. Favorite hidden gem in scottsdale and I'm very critical and picky about my food."}
{"text":"Stay away! I ordered the mozzarella basil and tomato salad-nasty! It took forever to make- there were 10 people back there.  I called to let them know how bad it was- I said I wanted a refund. The girl said can you come back with the salad and receipt today. No- I can't! I hv night school until 9pm and don't hv time to park and do all this. The salad was $8- overpriced and really small!  I then spoke to the manager to ask for a refund- apparently they do not refund over the phone- its principal! You are safer going next door to Subway! Overpriced, unfriendly owner- never returned my call bc he was \"busy\" in Scottsdale office- BS. Manager was nice but she is too smart to work for a narrow minded idiot. I guess he preferred I let everyone know his business practices rather than give me a simple refund!"}
{"text":"Tried today for the first time. Everything was really fresh and tasty. Mom and I loved it. I had chicken breast with grilled veggies and mom had a breakfast wrap. Spoke with the lovely owner and enjoyed all. Please support local business. This one was great!"}

{"text":"Bowl of greens is located in the space formerly occupied by Daphne's . They make an Excellent Greek salad with chicken. Very fresh and plentiful ingredients. Staff could be friendlier and more welcoming. 

I liked the tune of Italian music playing in the background .....oh wait maybe it wasn't Italian music playing after all ah!

Looking forward to returning to BOG with hopefully a warmer and more welcoming staff. The quality of the food itself is superb.

It wasn't busy at all and no one bothered to ask how my salad was. Oh well maybe I'm too picky and expect too much but there you have the scoop now !"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have slacked on this review for so long...shame on me!

This place is great. I've been here several times. Sometimes for just a fresh squeezed juice or for a wrap & sometimes for both. I always leave super happy with whatever I purchase. I work downtown so I call or order my items on line first and go walk and pick it up. It's always ready when they say it will be. 

Veggies, hummus, salads, wraps, pizzas.. get creative..everything is delicious!
The energizer fresh squeezed juice is my fav as well."}
{"text":"Colada smoothie with peach yogurt is really good! I had the shrimp salad as well which was light and flavorful. Will definitely be going back! I thought prices were reasonable for healthy organic ingredients, and for a restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love to make a build-your-own salad in between classes. They aren't usually cheap, but it's plenty of food to keep me going through the rest of the day. I was sad they didn't have their Italian dressing last time, but their house dressing is really good. It's a twist on balsamic vinaigrette, but much better! One suggestion to have coupons in the ASU Coupon Book!!"}
{"text":"Bowl of Greens has been the saving grace for me after hours of Pokemon Going.  They are located right next to a Pokemon Go gym (you can even battle from certain spots inside), so I stumbled in hot and thirsty one morning, looking for refreshment. A delicious Berry Smoothie made with almond milk did just the trick.   Their smoothies are made with fruit and ice, no yogurts or dairy, so they are vegan as long as you don't add any non-vegan additions, such as the protein powders or non-planted based milks.  They do charge $1 extra for the almond milk, making the smoothie $7.  They have a food menu, but the only vegan options seem to be a hummus wrap, salad, or fruit, so it's unlikely that I'll stray from the smoothies."}
{"text":"First, I just want to say that I love the salads here. This restaurant truly has great food.
 
I come to the downtown location on a regular basis as I work nearby. Every time I come in and order or order online there is an issue. Either the order is incorrect or they over charge me for a premium salad when my order is consistently not a premium.
 
In addition, the employees/managers are often bickering and rude not only to each other but to the customers. Today I heard one of the employees tell another to calm down. This is extremely unprofessional.
 
I finally said something today when they once again overcharged me and my coworker for salads that consists of lettuce, chicken, and some bell peppers only...super plain and definitely not a premium salad. After telling her that was not correct, she argued with me until I showed her my salad and she got the girl who made my salad to confirm.
 
Once confirmed, she brought over a woman who I assume was a manager. The manager refunded me .80 and did not acknowledge me at all. Also, I know the refund should have been more than .80. They charged me $10.02 and when I order online I get charged $8.95. I don't care about the .27 difference that they currently owe me. I'm just tired of this store constantly screwing up order, being rude, and not even apologizing for it. If even one of them had said, \"Oh you are right, this was overcharged. I'm so sorry, let me get you your refund...\", I wouldn't be so upset. 
 
I came in contact with three employees (one of which was a manager) at the register and not one of them apologized. After all that, I asked for a side of hot sauce and the girl informed me it was typically a .55 charge but that she'd \"let it go this time\". I couldn't believe she had the audacity to give me a hard time about a small side of hot sauce after everything that had just happened at the register. To act like she was doing me favor!? It was ridiculous. 

I have been going here for nearly two years and every single time, without fail, I am incredibly disappointed in the behavior from the owner down to the employees. I know I am not the only one with these experiences as there are a ton of posts/ reviews noting the same issues. In addition, this is a running joke at my office that you cannot go to bowl of greens more than once a month. We say this because everyone knows it is such a disaster and, as good as it is, we always leave frustrated.

I understand that the place is always busy and things do happen. I also know that there is no excuse for what I have experienced every time I walk in there. I have worked in all different fields of customer service and hospitality so I know these situations can absolutely be handled better. At some point, I really hope management takes these reviews into consideration adn makes some serious changes.

I would love nothing more than to be able to say Bowl of Greens is a great place to go. The food is great but it is consistently such a bad experience that I have a hard time ever recommending them without giving some kind of warning."}
{"text":"There are virtually no complaints from myself and friends when it comes to Bowl of Greens. The staff is incredibly friendly, attentive, and willing to make you something new if you are not satisfied with your order. (This only happened once to me, but it was truly because of personal preference, not the quality of the dish.)

The food prices are reasonable-especially for a college student.
The pita chips and hummus are the best I have ever had! 
The smoothies are a little price-y (~$5) but very much so worth it if you are craving one! They're freshly blended and healthy, too as an added bonus.
I feel full and satisfied every time I leave!"}
{"text":"Just a few blocks away from the office, I found this awesome healthy gem. I've had a variety of dishes here for lunch. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was delicious (hint - get a side of blue cheese). The Grilled Chicken Entree was one of my top favorites. I am not a fan of the brocolli, but their cauliflower was sooo tasty I wanted more. I also ordered the Lamb Kabob entree. Although the lamb was way over cooked and tough, I liked the seasoning. I will definitely be coming back to try different dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"So the food here is great, like fresh, well put together, and healthy great. Even their iced tea is brewed right ( if you drink iced tea this is hard to find ).

It's bright, clean, and has a good vibe to it. But what makes this five stars ( six if I could ) is that the manager and the staff care. They genuinely want to know how everything was for the purpose of making it better. 

I strongly suggest a visit, it's nice to eat at a place that understands what they're actually selling. I feel good eating this and eating it here."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Always fast and prompt! They defiantly have a lot of options to choose from, and I  love their little juice/smoothie bar!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times now and have been satisfied every time. I always get a custom salad, and they have pretty good choices for regular and premium add-ons. I usually get the spinach with black beans, red onion, red pepper, and mushrooms. I add avocado, and just get their house vinaigrette. It's nothing special, but the ingredients have always been (and tasted) fresh and crisp. They also give a very generous portion of avocado, which I really enjoy. It's nice to have this option around campus. Sure, there are some great restaurants around, but as far as fast food goes, nothing else very healthy is nearby. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I went here not expecting much. TALK ABOUT FANTASTIC. Literally the best salad place in the central Phoenix area. LOVE IT... LOVE. BTW.. try some of the grilled veggies... pleasant surprise. We will probably be back once a week."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a place to get fresh juice! They also deliver to businesses downtown."}
{"text":"Grilled shrimp salad literally came with three pieces of tiny shrimp.  And it still took them 15 minutes to bring it.  What a joke.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Build your own salad - yum! Fresh juice - yum! Amazing kabobs! Going to try the mediterranean platter next time. I'm sure it will be amazing. Great service. Delivery on bike to downtown - so if you work downtown call and they'll deliver! Don't drive here ... no good parking available. ASU students stop here for a quick HEALTHY bite instead of traditional fast food."}
{"text":"Terrible experience every time I go there..I usually only get a smoothie and hummus and chips when ever I come here because of the convenience. The staff is extremely rude and they are not willing to help. This happens EVERY time I come here. Everyone is usually always in a grumpy mood. Expect for the staff to be annoyed if you ask for questions or small substitutions."}
{"text":"Omg!! Love this place! Had eggplant sandwich yesterday and grill shrimp with veggies and rice today. It is so delicious! Tastes so fresh and delicious. My new favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, vegetables are fresh and smoothies are excellent. I recommend chicken parmigiana and lamb kabob plate. They don't make the food ahead of time so be prepared to wait 15 min or so for take out orders. It's perfect for those week nights when you don't feel like cooking. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is alright and the service is nice but the prices are downright terrible. I have had better smoothies for half the price. if I wanted to pay almost $10 for a chicken Caesar salad I would just go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm rarely disappointed but the last time I came here I went to order a $5 smoothie and the girl making it decided that she should argue with me about what a smoothie really is, hat you can add to it then wanted me to give her a step by step of how to make BOGs own smoothies.

Tonight I stopped to get my favorite lamb entree which comes with rice and a BOG salad for $8. I had the rice substituted for pita chips an got it to go which usually is fine but instead of a salad there were just a few pieces of lettuce. No toppings or anything. The lamb want lamb instead I got nothing but gristle; one piece was a solid hunk of fat! The only thing edible was the pita chips, the rest had to be thrown away. I ordered a large OJ, tiramisu and te lamb entree which totaled over $20 and like I said the entree had to be thrown away.

The tiramisu is really good but it isn't worth $40 for the tiny portion you get. I ordered it for my dad and there's only 2-3 bites.

To be honest I'm afraid to go to BOG again and it used to be the one place I stopped at between classes or on the way home. After tonight's experience I'm not even sure if I want to stop in to get the always great go-to grilled chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options and service was fantastic. Place is clean and owner personally gave us recommendations."}
{"text":"They have the best Caesar salad I've ever had.  The chicken is freshly grilled and the pita chips they use in it makes it so bomb.  I always order online because the line is always so long so I'm glad that they have that feature."}
{"text":"I like this place but really 3 shrimp for a 10.50 Shrimp salad?  I don't think so! Order the chicken Caesar much better value. The juices are just ok. This place is a little pricey, but that may be due to the location."}
{"text":"Two because I witnessed something here that I have not seen before in a restaurant.  The employees behind the counter were disagreeing about  how my order was taken and he abusivly told her to \"Shut Up.\"  Not at all  appropriate.
Other than that, service  was slightly slow  but the food was OK.   Lot's of veggie options but no whole grains  or slim milk.  Healthy but half steppin'."}
