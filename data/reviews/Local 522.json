{"text":"Local 522 on 6th Ave SW is the sister restaurant to Local 510 on 17th Avenue.  Formerly the Pied Pickle, Local 522 has definitely given this space a trendy upgrade.  Inside, it's dark and cozy, with wood chopping blocks as table tops and funky lighting.  Outside, they have the glorious patio for which the Pickle relied on for most of their business.
This place has been constantly a-buzz since it opened - I highly recommend lunch reservations.  
The menu is short, but sweet, and offers \"classy pub food\" - everything from burgers of various types of meats, to flatbreads, to fish & chips, which is what I opted to order.
Sadly, I cannot rave about the food.  It finally arrived about 45 minutes after ordering, and though it was still hot, it was just so-so.  I should've known better than to order fish & chips for $12 when the fish is basa (not exactly a superstar fish for eating).  I also opted to upgrade to yam fries for a few bucks more, and the fish was sitting on top of the fries, so they were pretty greasy from the fish fry oil.  Also, the tartar sauce was not good - too citrusy for me, but it worked well as a dipping sauce for the fries (which everyone else seemed to get a specific fry dipping sauce except me).  In hindsight, I'd have ordered the chicken burger, which was an unbreaded breast on a tiny bun with pickles that seemed to be a fave amongst my fellow diners.  Apparently the soup of the day was dyno-mite, but I didn't try any myself.  
So, head to Local 522 for a great patio, cool atmosphere, and if you're going to order food, stick to the burgers!"}
{"text":"Amazing hipster bar! Lots of fun people to mingle with and the environment is so cool! Haven't tried the food yet but the menu had a good variety. Awesome place to get hammy pants at haha"}
{"text":"Been a couple of times lately for lunch with customers and for beers after work. Seem to always be quite busy, the service was good and fast despite being quite packaed at lunch. Food was good standard pub fare with a couple of twists. Today tried the Cuban style painini, I thought it was excellent, very tasty sandwich. It a nice atmosphere. I'd head back for sure, but make reservations for lunch or get there ealy."}
{"text":"Ok... on one hand it's hard to go anywhere but up when you're replacing a Pied Pickle with almost anything else (so really Local 522 had a 'free swing')... on the other hand it's AWESOME to see a place (downtown no less!!) that actually 'GET'S IT'.  It's no wonder that this place has gone from practically empty to constantly busy to jam packed on a Friday lunch/after work.  Decent (de-Pied Picklized) interior, great service staff (that aren't overly 'Earls-ie') and food that's probably best described as 'Nuevo-Pub' (that is, nicely presented, pub inspired but slightly twisted and tasty at a two star price point...try the Chicken Pot Pie - spectacular if it's chilly out... try the Fish&Chips - well above the 'norm'... try their ribs - not at all what you'd expect).  I also like that their manager 'gets it' too... he recognizes regulars and does backflips to keep them well served and happy (really this goes for the entire staff...).  Factor in the alternatives downtown and it's hard not to be a big big fan of Local 522."}
{"text":"Came here for the sole reason of catching some bands I wanted to see. I actually like the way this bar looks, but the crowd wasn't really my style.

I hadn't eaten supper and was hoping to get a bite here. Turns out they close the kitchen when they have shows on, just something to keep in mind.

Good sound, awesome dancing, and steam whistle tall cans. I forgot my scarf here and called about it, thye were super nice about it and said they had it for me to pick up. I could see myself coming back here for another show."}
{"text":"Still stand by my previous review of Local 522. Nice atmosphere of cabin sheek. Average beer selection. Great after work place for a couple of pints with colleagues, very chill atmosphere. Average pub food, portions getting skimpier though stretched out to look larger. Perhaps this is the Mark Wahlberg of pubs, a speciman of strong physical features and OK substance."}
{"text":"Local 522 is a great little bar/restaurant.  I never even knew it existed before yesterday though I've been in the room before....weird, right? The reason is b/c Local 522 is usually where you eat when you attend functions in the giant downtown tent during Stampede.

Anyway....the server staff is very friendly, the food is varied and tasty and the place is hopping.  I think the prices are pretty good for downtown as well.  Definitely a place to check out though if you want to go for lunch on Friday a reservation is DEFINITELY required."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the food at Local 522 because I got here late and had come to check out a live show. I can however comment on the vibe and the crowd.

Local 522 is the downtown counterpart to Local 510 which is located on 17th Avenue. During the weekdays the crowd is comprised mostly of downtown working bees, however, on the weekends, this place attracts all types of people who come to check out the live performances that it hosts.

Intimate performances are always the best, and while this isn't as intimate as it gets in Calgary, the energy of the crowd was notable. Everyone was friendly and excited and any notions of pretentiousness or snobbishness seemed to have been left at the door.

The staff was nice and the drinks were good.

Overall, not my favourite place to check out local talent, but a pretty A-OK night nonetheless."}
{"text":"Once again, a situation where I wish I could rate one member of the staff differently from the actual experience. 

Granted, the ladies and I came here on an extremely busy pre-St. Patrick's Day Friday night, which meant it was a bologna forest in there. Loud, crowded, with the kind of attentiveness from waitstaff one would expect from a place that has their female servers wear daisy dukes. 

Service was scant and curt, and at one point, one of the ladies with us had to go up to the bar and get her own drink. It was pretty much one-star city until the adorable manager came to our rescue, got us our food and drinks and bought us apology shots. Another thing the Local 522 has going for it; a really good veggie burger. Well-made, flavorful and not at all a beany hockeypuck. The sweet potato fries, not so much. The flavor was there, but they were thought-provokingly flaccid. Whatever, I ate them anyway. 

Good food and good company are what saved the day (don't they always?), and I really enjoyed meeting some of the ladies at our table! I'd risk coming back here; on a much quieter evening."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Only a few people in here. But waited half an hour for first contact. And yet there were two managers swanning around with friends. BBQ chicken was, without any warning, so hot and spicy, it was virtually inedible. Fish tacos were so small, a more apt name would be Minnow tacos. Super expensive for awful service and food."}
{"text":"Place is great, didn't eat today, only drinks. 

As with most bars of this nature the service can be hit and miss. Girl was cute and all (if you're into girls) but her service was down right shit. Refusal to make eye contact, walks away quickly, abrasive almost. No romancing or anything just one word responses 'sure' 'okay' etc. Like she was almost too good to stick around and talk to you, had to get back to her snap chat and Instagram I'm sure. 

News flash - IF YOU HATE YOUR JOB THAN QUIT - 

I don't appreciate your shit attitude painted all over your face."}
{"text":"The food is good but not something that would blow me away and cause to go there frequently.  Service was good and friendly. I will go back as it is central for a lot of us to meet up at for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"The nachos are amazing! Perfectly layered with melted cheese and all the toppings you'd want on them. Mine came with beef, chicken, and guac. The staff and management are friendly, and efficient."}
{"text":"My experience at this pub didn't start out so well. They don't take debit and the ATM machine wouldn't dispense me money so I had to drive somewhere else to take out money and then come back. The parking lot only takes credit card and I had to call that in. 

When I found the yelpers I was meeting for a drink it took so long for service that I just went and got my own drink up at the bar. The server was horrible the rest of the night with the exception of the manager of the bar bringing me my dinner and one round of drink orders. The server would come to the table and take the glasses while avoiding eye contact. Then she hurry off while you tried to make an order. 

The one shinning light was that my food was really tasty considering it was pub food. The mushroom soup was full of mushrooms and very flavorful. The chicken burger was cooked to perfection. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I really liked the coleslaw on the side added to put on the burger. 

The lighting is funky, dark and calming. The bar was full the entire time we were there and quite loud. The music was blaring and you could just barely hear each other if you screamed in each others faces. The people were a fun mix of business and trendy. It was easy to meet new people and I enjoyed a night of intellectual conversation mixed with drunken silliness. 

Overall the food is good but the service just plain sucked. I've only been there once so I'd like to give it another try.

All and all it was an exceptional night. The company made the night enjoyable. More than that it allowed me the chance to meet some of the yelpers and know that yelp is filled with some really wonderful people."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Richie lined me up with a beer while I waited for a table. The servers are friendly, attractive and attentive. And the vibe is great at lunch. They know what they are doing. Employees were all competent."}
{"text":"Local 522 played host to a long overdue reunion with a friend of mine (like 17 years long...), so it will forever hold a delicate place in my heart for that alone.  We came on a Monday night, and not much was going on in here.  Perfect for some catching up.  Our waitress was pleasant though not very knowledgeable about their beers.  I enquired about their dark beers and she said Guinness.  Wanting to try something a little more local I asked about their brown ales and their level of hops (I don't do hoppy).  She said she didn't really know but would bring me a couple samples.  She brought me blonds.   Oh well, we were drinking light beers then.  Lots of great menu options for food.  We were in the pizza mood, so we ordered the mushroom pizza which was really freaking delicious and the pizza margherita which was not as outstanding but alright.  I could see making my way back here again."}
{"text":"Now, I have totally sh*&bagged the sister 002 on my post, but this place is different as the servers are GREAT! The food here is good - I had the beef burger which was cooked spot on (and fresh) while guest had veggie burger (raved twice).
Great vibe and is very active which is also loud, but a energy filled spot to get you going!"}
{"text":"Any place that has a moose's head on the wall earns points in my book. Especially when that head of moose sticks into the inspired lighting and subtle design of the Local 522. It is not a particularly large space, but it is well laid out so that it seems spacious, quirky and classy - all at the same time!

I was just at a show at the Local 522, so let me tell you while my memory is still fresh: This place will charm your socks off. I'm definitely going back. They were not serving food while I was there and we arrived to late to get a table, but I saw a menu board full of delicious sounding dinners that I will have to try on my return. Also, I would like to give a shout out to the staff, all of whom were courteous, patient and polite. 

The Local 522 was very full of people which gave it an excellent energy even though it is not particularly well designed for live shows. The sound system was still decent and there was enough space to crowd around the stage and dance. I was definitely pleasantly surprised, considering I hadn't even heard of it before this."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch meeting and the place was packed. The prices were reasonable for food,and it came out hot. They lose a star for liqueur prices. Many downtown places have adjusted and it seems a little steep for drink prices.... esp since I indulge... quite a bit."}
{"text":"This is a good down town sport to watch Champion's League soccer matches over a late, and somewhat extended lunch.

The food is fine, and consistent most of the time.The same applies to the service.

Almost always packed with guys , as that is the business model, the review is based on food drinks, and service."}
{"text":"Loud and aloof...full on sausage party on the regular. Food options are ok however, not much available for vegan/veggie people. Salads are often wilted. 50% of the time the service is crap.

We head here because it takes reservations and it's walking distance from work. 

Sadly, they cannot make Moscow Mules or Dark & Stormy's which is true to most places in YYC. 

Decent for lunch, and for getting molested by the eyes of all the plaid/striped shirt, ill-fitting pants wearing Calgarian men."}
{"text":"This Nice sport bar has an excellent location in downtown to have lunch or have a drink after work!.. The ambience is really nice!!.. And the pizza is delicious!!... In addition the service is very good..."}
{"text":"Local 522 seems to be a good place for colleagues on a Friday afternoon for some BEERZ!
They have a good selection of bottled and draught beers and the service so far has been pretty great!  They also have specials on their appies and drinks and if you follow them on Twitter, you can be allllll up in there like swimwear. @Local522
I am yet to have food at Local 522 due to my Friday afternoon liquid intake priority, BUT I hear the food is pretty good.
The servers and bartenders are mostly women, and are all gorgeous!  When you go there, you'll ask yourself \"What's with the sausage fest...\" but you'll soon realize.  But these beer babes have their head in the game and get the job done (beer in hand, refills, accurate bills, etc)
Pop on down to Local, but if you're coming with a large group, be sure to make a reso if you can.  It can get pretty packed by 3:30 pm.  There's even a little patio for those awesome Spring and Summer days when being outside is just too irresistible!"}
