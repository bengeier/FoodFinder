{"text":"A bowl of noodle costs $14 and an hour of your life staring into a half empty restaurant in the lineup. I have seen people work faster in a communist country than this Tokyo ramen restaurant"}
{"text":"Yes the service isn't as good as \"other places\" but the ramen was AMAZING. Every reviewer here is too critical like they are some sort of 5 star michelin chef. You reviewers need a new hobby or something lol. Like what do you guys eat at home if the food here was so bad? If it was so bad why not just send it back and give them a chance to redeem themselves instead of write an instantly bad review?   We tried the tofu nuggets, karaage, dumpling, red chilli ramen, and the special ramen.  dumplings, karaage and the ramen stand out a lot. The broth that they made for the ramen is unbelievable. I've never had something so rich and flavourful. Tofu nuggets are good but whatever, it's tofu lol.   Please don't read the other reviews and give this place a try, the service isn't that great, but it's not a fancy restaurant where you expect your water to be topped off every 5 seconds. Each one of these reviewers just seem entitled, they're NEW... what do you expect? Also, the people that work here are probably new to the service industry as well! so give them a break and try this place and enjoy the new favours that you get from this place, it's different!"}
{"text":"Most of my favourite ramen restaurants are downtown.  So when I heard that a Michelin-recommended ramen joint was opening its first overseas location AND it was in my area, I was excited!  This week is their soft opening, so the restaurant is still trying to iron out any kinks.  Also: since it is their soft opening, they are only accepting cash!  My parents and I came on Sunday at 5pm since we wanted to avoid the dinner rush.  There was no line-up (there was one couple ahead of us) but a line quickly formed behind us.  Seating took a little longer than expected since we saw there were open seats but again, this is their soft opening, and their staff is still getting used to the restaurant arrangements.    I ended up ordering their Signature Clam Broth Shio Ramen (as did my dad) and my mom ordered the Signature Clam Broth Shoyu Ramen.  My parents and I agreed that the shio broth was much better than the shoyu (you could taste the clam base in the shio whereas the soy sauce base in the shoyu overpowered the clam base).  The noodles had a great chewiness and texture and the chashu was very tender as well.  What I liked most about the ramen was that I didn't feel heavy after my meal (as I often do after eating ramen).  The only downside?  I really enjoy having egg in my ramen but I discovered that you had to add it on to your bowl (an additional $1.50).  However, the true enjoyment of ramen should really be the broth and noodles, so I can understand their reasoning.  I also ordered a Pork Belly Don ($6) on the side to share.  I definitely recommend this as the pork belly was very tasty and tender and the rice had the right softness to it.  After dinner, we headed to the joint dessert cafe, Saryo.  I ordered a matcha soft serve ice cream (it's made the uji matcha powder - the best!).  Unfortunately, the ice cream machine was not co-operating (but I can understand as these machines over heat easily).  The chef pleasantly surprised us with the hojicha soft serve ice cream since we were waiting quite a while.  I really enjoyed both the matcha and hojicha soft serve but if I were to recommend one, I'd say to order the hojicha.  It's probably one of the best in Toronto.  Overall, a pleasant experience here and I'll definitely be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Had the clam shoyu. Gf had the clam shio. I guess it just wasn't quite what we expected because it was just meh. The broth was clear with a light clam flavour. The soy in the shoyu pretty much just tasted like soy sauce broth with a hint of clam.  When I think ramen, I think rich and creamy and that wasn't what we got. Didn't try the other flavours but since we got the the \"signature\" clam ramens, we just expected more/different.  Noodles themselves were excellent. Also had the chicken karaage, came with a dip, a wasabi/horseradish mayo-like mixture, pretty good. Pork belly was also really good. But ramen is all about the broth... salty thick deliciously rich broth. If I can see the noodles underneath the broth, something is not right..."}
{"text":"New ramen place in the Yonge Sheppard area near Empress Walk.  They have been in the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for 4 years in a row.  This is their first overseas location outside of Japan.  Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted with a bunch of Japanese desserts, but that's because the space is shared with Saryo, a cafe/dessert place.  The Konjiki side has a clean modern minimalist design with plenty of seating.  We waited about 15 minutes to get a table.  The restaurant is still in the soft opening phase (day 2) but everything appeared to be running smoothly.  Menus were brought and we ordered quickly.  First up was the Signature Clam Broth Ramen (Shoyu).  House made ramen in clam, pork, and chicken broths with sous vide pork and red wine braised bamboo shoots.  Truffle sauce, leeks, onions, and porcini flake oil topped it off.  In order to experience the 3 distinct broths, one had to start eating as soon as the bowl arrived at the table before the broths mixed. The broth flavours were very good.  The ramen was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of chewyness.  The pork was super lean and very tender.  And the bamboo shoots were delish... I think they used fresh bamboo shoots.  Next was the  Special Tonkotsu Ramen.  The pork bone soup base was very flavourful, the ramen had the right amount of chewyness, and the lean sous vide pork very tender.  Topping this bowl off was finely sliced ginger and  what I think is pickled/preserved cabbage which was a nice contrast to the broth.  Overall, very thoughtfully and carefully prepared ramen with the result being a great combination of textures and flavours.  Highly recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really want to LOVE this place, but the food we had was just underwhelming. Prolly will not return despite it is only their soft opening."}
{"text":"Yum. I think these guys are finding their legs now. I went for lunch and had crisp karaage and the signature clam broth (shoyu) ramen. The noodles and broth were hot, and the broth was quite light and nicely sweet. All in all a lovely meal. Not sure I would wait 25 mins every time, but it's a great place to drop by."}
{"text":"Just opened and it shows. The host and waiters were really nice but a little they were scrambling when it came to seating, orders, and getting the bill.   I ordered the black tonkotsu ramen with extra braised pork belly. The ramen had great texture. The broth was good, but not fantastic, the flavour was lacking and it wasn't that hot. They forgot my egg. When they brought it over, the yolk was actually cold. My significant other got the signature clam broth shoyu ramen. It was unique, but forgettable. The broth is light not as filling as the tonkotsu.  There are better ramen places in Toronto, but perhaps this place will get better as they age."}
{"text":"Went twice, once for soft opening and once recently. No doubt the signature live up to expectation as the ramen survives in the competitive market of Tokyo and while being recommended in the Michelin Guide (not in the star rank, just gourmet serction). But I can only give 3 star as the customer service and wait line issues is not worth your time and money. This is all due to lack of training of the staff and incompetent management. The ramen hype for Toronto has been lit again and I suspect more Japanese chain would come in the years to come."}
{"text":"Food: The Clam Broth Shio is AMAZING!! The flavours are so subtle and delicate which elevated it to another level - MUST TRY! We also tried the Shoyu version and I thought the flavour of shoyu overpowered the great flavours of the broth a tad too much, but still enjoyable.  Service: Great service, all the staff were very friendly and I didn't have anywhere to put my big winter jacket as I was seated at the end spot in the stool area, the waitress was so considerate that she offered to put my jacket in the back for me.   THANK YOU Konjiki for an amazing culinary experience!"}
{"text":"The soup is very flavourful and the noodles are cooked to perfection however I advise to visit during the weekdays or when the hype dies down. I don't mind waiting at all but only when it's a fair queue. They need to manage the queue better because it's chaotic. I met someone I know waiting in line, they got there 10 mins before we did and by the time we got seated, they were finished with their meals and we took their spot. Many people that came way after us got seated before and finished. The number of parties were the same in all cases- 2. If you put your name down on the list, be sure to wait somewhere close to the front because they will call for you a few times, if you're in the back you won't be able to hear and they won't be bothered to look for you."}
{"text":"Great ramen bar!  Had heard about their clam based broth all the way in California & had to try it for my weekend in Toronto. It did not disappoint. From the greeting when we entered to the great customer service when there was a little issue, my expectations were far exceeded. The noodles!  Omg, the noodles were absolutely the best ramen noodles I have ever had. They said they flew them in from Japan and they were excellent.  I only wish I would still be here on Wednesday to try their lobster ramen, next trip."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite ramen place! I'm a bit of a ramen connoisseur if I do say so myself.. my boyfriend and I have hit almost every ramen joint in Toronto.  Konjiki has a nice welcoming atmosphere, we were greated warmly right away and sat immediately. The menu is smart but I like that, it's not overwhelming like some ramen places!  I chose Original Tonkotsu ramen, my boyfriend got Smoky Black Tonkotsu ramen. We got a side of pork belly with egg.  The food came within minutes, SO FAST. The broth, so thick and rich. The pork is so soft and buttery with so much flavour. The eggs are so tasty and almost like candy.  Everything was great!! Highly recommended, there was nothing bad to say. Plus next to the restaurant is Saryo, where you can pick up something sweet after!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge ramen fan, but this place offers some pretty tasty ramen :) came on a weekday for lunch and only had to line up for about 10 mins."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this ramen place since it's close to home and was so hyped up. Waited 30+ minutes to get (not the issue because we knew it would be long) and the food took FOREVER to come out despite placing our order quickly. Wait staff is completely DISORGANIZED. Food and service levels are MEDIOCRE at best. Tables that were seated after us received their meals before us, finished their food, paid the bill etc and left before we even got our first dish! Wait staff would pass by our table and look at our empty table but said nothing and didn't check on our food or provide an update. Had to finally ask what was taking so long and then they said the kitchen was making it now (30m later after being seated). Did they miss our order? Who knows because they didn't provide an explanation! Ruined the entire experience for us."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with a super flavorful broth. Tried the signature clam broth shoyu and the spicy red tonkatsu ramen, both were tasty and not too salty. Went at 12:30pm on a Thursday and had to wait around 40mins in line for a table, but once we were seated the food arrived really quickly!  Overall worth the wait but may go back at a more off-peak time next time."}
{"text":"Friend told me about this place, hearing good reviews about it, so decided to try it out. Be prepared to wait for seating during peak times, ensure your whole party is there as we had to wait much longer as our entire group wasn't there. Atmosphere is great, hip spot with Asian nuances noted. Food came out quite quickly. Decided to try the Signature Clam Broth (shoyu) ramen dish added an egg and pork belly as extras/sides. It was very tasty, pork belly was very soft. Tried the tofu nuggets as an appetizer, they were really good (a must try). Price point is typical for a ramen spot. Would go again, but probably at low peak times."}
{"text":"Due to all the hype surrounding this Michelin starred ramen restaurant (in Japan), the lineups are too long to stand outside in the cold for.   I got here around 5:30 and still waited around 30 minutes before being seated on uncomfortable bar stools in the middle.   I ordered the signature clam broth ramen (shoyu) and it was saltier than I expected. My boyfriend ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I preferred the broth way more.   Service is still all over the place as the newly opened restaurant still need to find their mojo, but on a cold winters' night, I can never say no to a bowl of ramen!"}
{"text":"Their signature clam broth ramen is worth checking out for something different than the usual pork or miso broths. I've tried both the mild and intense and they are both good. The lines are usually quite long but they move quickly.   The soft serve roasted matcha ice cream is also worth checking out."}
{"text":"I visited with my family to see what the hype was about. Each of us ordered a different ramen. Signature Clam Broth Shoyu (soy-sauce) was the best tasting ramen. Signature Clam Broth Shio (salt) had a more distinct seafood smell and taste. Smoky Black Tonkotsu was one of the best tonkotsu I tried. Gyoza (dumplings) had a good ginger taste, but I thought five pieces for $5 was a bit expensive. We ate ramen with extra braised pork belly. It was mostly fat and not enough meat. I would not get them again. The quality of each ramen was better other places. Also, I think there were more noodles in each bowl. However, ramen costs $3 more compared to other restaurants, so I took that into account. It was busy inside, but servers were efficient and eager to please. I had a good experience, but the overall cost was higher than I expected. I would like to come back but only when I am willing to spend some money."}
{"text":"Despite all the hype it's just an okay, average sort of ramen shop. Had the recommended clam broth noodles; certainly not below average compare to other ramen places, but the taste is nothing spectacular either. The thin pork slices were tender, nicely done, but overall lacking in portion. Though it's lucky I didn't had to wait in line for too long to be seated, came in at the right time of the day i suppose."}
{"text":"Must Try: Signature Clam Broth Ramen, Tonkotsu Ramen  Rating: (10/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    One of those times a restaurant lives up to the hype. A Michelin rated restaurant's first location outside of Japan get it done right.  Although comparatively Konjiki is 'more expensive' than other places, I would say that amount is worth it, given the unique flavour and quality of the ramen.  The broth on both our dishes were unique and amazing. There was a strong clam flavour with their signature broth, while the Tonkotsu was rich and creamy. Both had great (and a plentiful) of ramen. We tried both the pork belly and the pork shoulder, which were great, but weren't the heroes of the dish. The chicken karrage was also unique with the wasabi mayo mixed right into the batter, so the skin itself had the nice kick.   The service was friendly and efficient, with the seating area good for about 40+ individuals. Definitely not the place to bring a group larger than 4 people, two would be the ideal party size to get a good seat within a reasonable time.   There is also a cafe/dessert shop at the front of the restaurant with different parfaits, drinks and special cakes.  The only issue would be the wait time, although this can be forgiven as they are still in their soft opening phase. We waited for about 30 minutes. It was a bit disorganized, as the hostess needed everyone to wait in line and she'd come through the crowd to take the names down, rather than just taking in names as individuals came in. This created much more crowded lines and confused first time customers."}
{"text":"I think it's worth trying, but not worth the typical 1h+ wait.\  The shoyu clam broth is unique, though the intensity of clam flavour really seemed to vary from bowl to bowl.  We were told to try the broth in three separate spots of the bowl: The first, in the spot where the truffle oil floats, secondly, where the bamboo sits, and finally, in the opposite corner where it's pure, unadulterated broth.  My favourite by far was the truffled broth, which I'd recommend sipping before it gets lost in the rest of the bowl.  I also enjoyed the noodle texture.  The egg, at $1.50, is rather expensive, and came out more solidly cooked than molten.  I'm guessing it was sous-vided to the perfect doneness but the additional cook time by the hot broth was a bit over.  An extra $1.50 for an overcooked egg that was never included in the ramen is a bit of a travesty!"}
{"text":"Tried the first international location of this Tokyo ramen restaurant by Chef Atsushi Yamamoto.  Konjiki Ramen opened recently to much fanfare because of its Michelin guide Bib Gourmand listing for several years in a row (this is the Michelin section for excellent food with moderate prices). I've never been to the Tokyo location so I can't compare my experience here. But from photos I see some difference, esp w the cha-su (pork). Konjiki makes their own noodles in house, and the signature broth is chicken/pork based enhanced by clams. Modern touches include porcini mushrooms, truffles.   I ordered the Intense Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen.  Bottom line: I was disappointed and not impressed. The broth was fragrant but flavour was somehow flat and lacked depth. The noodles were unremarkable. The egg was not runny. And the cha-su was dry and tasteless.   I don't know how much is due to the newness of the place and kitchen staff, or the busy crowd on a Sun evening, but Chef Yamamoto will be returning to Tokyo in a few days after being here for a little while, so it'd be surprising if logistics is still an issue.  Another problem could be it's impossible to replicate the same thing in Japan. You can't get the same type/quality of raw ingredients for the broth. The flour for noodles are different. And certain factors need to be slightly adjusted for Canadian taste (egg yolk runniness, pork fattiness). Could it be the chef is new to Canada and hasn't had time to adapt his recipe to local availability? I'm guessing. But I was definitely not impressed. I included a photo of the same shoyu ramen from the Tokyo location from the web and you can see the difference, esp in the cha-su (I accept that North Americans will not like pinkish pork but the fat-less extra lean cut used here makes it taste dry). But it's very disappointing. I was dining with another Japanese ramen chef from Tokyo and several other Japanese natives. All were disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday at 6pm. There was already a lineup, and we got our table around 7pm (group of 6 people). I ordered the signature clam broth ramen (shoyu) priced at $14. I found that the broth was a little bit salty and the ramen does not come with an egg; it is an extra cost. The cost for ramen here is also on the pricier side. I would probably come back to try the other signature ramen dish, but only if there there was no line up. I would not lineup to eat at this place. I also tried their gyoza and chicken karaage which was priced at $5 each plate. There was nothing special with either dish, and the portion was quite small.   On a positive note, the waitresses and waiters were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried to swim in place yesterday and it was extremely delicious. The lineup + 30 minutes but it was well worth the wait. I had this spicy Ramen which was very creamy and not too spicy. My friend had the regular miso Ramen and she loved it and she's normally not a Ramen person. The prices were decent $14 for a bowl of soup which was more than enough soup. And the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend this place. We also tried too much ice cream in Waffle which was extremely delicious but I don't recommend it if you don't like the strong Taste of my check is this one was heavily filled with matcha"}
{"text":"First experience was bad.  They had just opened up a week earlier and everyone was learning their roles.  I waited for half an hour before they took my order..   Second visit was stellar, placed my order almost right away, ice cold beer, asari based broth, piping hot noodles and tasty chashu."}
{"text":"Excellent soup base!  Excellent ramen!! Ordered their signature clam soup ramen and it's absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"So happy I got to try this place....without the line up. Came around 2pm on a weekday. I got the spicy tonkatsu...it was good. But I preferred the original clam! That's what I'll be getting next visit!"}
{"text":"The staff isn't properly trained and the food presentation is the worst. The clam broth was delicious but i wouldn't consider this to be the best ramen.  Not sure what the hype is about because it just your basic meal."}
{"text":"To be honest, Konjiki Ramen is probably one of the best ramen places in Toronto. No joke. The ramen noodles are cooked to perfection with an extremely flavourful soup. You would kind of expect this combination to be overwhelming but au contraire, the noodles are nice and chewy while the base contains many umami flavours but not too salty - making it drinkable. Then there's the topping. There's bamboo shoots, pork slices, eggs and the regular greens (onions and such) on top. The bamboo shoots and pork slices were cooked very nicely, however, in my opinion, the best topping was the egg. It held its own soft salty flavour and when you bite in, you can see the yoke flowing out slightly. It is literally perfection in every bowl and a wonderful way to warm yourself up on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Wow! This is probably the best ramen I had outside of Japan. I arrived at 5:50 and waited a good 30min before being seated at the stools. On the menu were 5-7 different ramen selections and a few appetizers. I ordered the spicy ramen, karage and the Goyza.   The appetizers were nothing special, the dipping sauce for the karage was actually disappointing. But the ramen! Oh the ramen was SO GOOD! The spicy ramen was so creamy and savoury. It was so good I had to drink all the soup, leaving any would be a waste.   This place is worth your time if you can afford to wait a good 30mins in line.  P.s. the waiters should be a bit less pushy and rushing when asking customers what to order"}
{"text":"Signature Clam Broth Ramen I could identify the taste of clam and other ingredient flavours in the soup. The texture of the ramen noodle is on the thick side, it is filling, which is good. When the waiter delivered the bowl of ramen, seems like there's a certain position that has to be placed in front of the customers. That's very unique!! The two slices of chashu are as thin as pieces of paper.  Black Smokey Tonkatsu Ramen The soup is more stronger in taste. I could taste garlic or perhaps charcoal in the broth. There are probably more ingredients in the broth but I could not identify them all. Nevertheless, it tastes awesome! The cherry tomatoes that come along in the ramen bowl are as sweet as candies. Instead of putting chashu in the ramen, there are minced pork, which is not what I normally see.   There's another section for dessert inside this restaurant, which is google to be my next stop.  In conclusion, this place is awesome and I will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch and was a bit hesitant. After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I was worried that the ramen would fall flat and be substantially below standard.  We came early at roughly 11:20am and just missed the crowd. People started to steadily trickle in at around 11:25am, and soon enough, a line began forming. The customer service was excellent; the servers were very friendly, and kept apologizing profusely for the wait (they had let the crowd in from the cold earlier than before the restaurant opened). One waitress even said, \"Sorry, but please hold on a little longer. The restaurant actually opens at 11:30am\".  The four of us ordered two creamy tonkotsu ramen and two shio signature clam broth ramen. The place doesn't offer green tea, as it costs an additional $1 for the tea, so we only got hot water to drink. The tonkotsu broth was so white and creamy!! It was delicious and so sinfully great. My sister didn't like the addition of the pickled vegetables and ginger though, as she said it took away from the richness and creaminess of the broth. My mom added an egg to hers, and it was perfectly made.  My dad and I ordered the shio clam broth. For those who enjoy the purity of flavours (like me), I would recommend not mixing in everything and just enjoying the simple flavours of the broth before digging in. Once you mix everything together, the flavour of the truffle oil becomes overwhelming and slightly overpowers the sweetness of the clam and chicken broth. It becomes slightly too much and overpowering. That said, I still thoroughly enjoyed the ramen and rate it very highly. The char siu is also very lean and smooth - it is unlike the fatty pork belly of certain ramen places like Kinton, but delicious in its own way.  The portions are, however, quite small. My ramen only had three thin pieces of char siu and some bamboo shoots. The noodle portion is just enough to satisfy you."}
{"text":"So I went to Konjiki today (Saturday) for lunch... Oh My Goodness!!! Hands down THE BEST ramen in town!! This place has set a new standard for what ramen should taste like. We went as a group of 6, the wait was approximately 20 minutes. They have a long hallway inside the restaurant so people can line up without standing in the cold outside. The servers were polite and quick with their job. I got the black tonkotsu with an egg and extra pork. The egg was by far the best I had in ramen. It was cooked perfectly and was so flavourful. The two cherry tomatoes were smokey and extremely delicious. Their homemade noodles were perfectly cooked - not soggy and overdone and not too hard and chewy.  The broth... best I have had!!! It was flavourful, super creamy and not too salty not like most other places'. The best broth I have ever tried. The pork that was on the ramen was ground and not sliced which is something I have never had in a ramen before. I recommend getting sliced pork as an add on. The sliced pork was super soft and flavourful. My friend got their signature clam broth ramen and I tried a bit of the broth. I can't say I am a big fan of that. It was flavourful but not creamy. Try their tonkotsu or any of their other creamy ramens first, then give their clam broth ones a try. They even have a dessert cafe in front of the restaurant that has matcha and chocolate ice cream and many other dessert options. We did not actually get a chance to try it because we were so stuffed after all the ramen, but the desserts looked amazing. The total cost with the egg and the sliced pork was 17.50 + tax. Knowing that the chef for this place had a Michelin star restaurant in Japan, I came here with high expectations. I was blown away by how great the food was, and can't wait to go back again! This ramen was heavenly. If you like ramen you HAVE TO come here. The ride to North York is totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Take cash! Their machine is broken.  We learn about this only after our meal! Closest bank is to the right of the resto, and it is scotia bank.  Repertoire is limited compared to Kinton, Isshin etc.but what they offer they do well. Staff are friendly and helpful. Small space, probably seats 30 ppl at a time. If you go as a party of 2 or by yourself, will likely be able to skip the lineup.   Repeat: not immediately. Isshin is the only Ramen place we seek out."}
{"text":"I had diarrhea after I eat the mild shio ramen yesterday T.T and my friend had same issue too....."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to visit this restaurant despite all the hype surrounding it. So what's all the fuss about? I have been to enough ramen shops in Japan to know that this place is consistent with any ramen great ramen shops in Tokyo or any Japanese city.   Let's start with the broth (tip: always sip the broth before eating. It introduces the palette the symphony of tastes). Simple shoyu broth that isn't greasy. A subtle clam aroma underneath it the broth gives it a complex set of flavours unlike anything I tried elsewhere. The only other ramen shop in Japan that I tried that does this is Afuri. The noodles were perfectly cooked and slightly crinkly to absorb the broth. I ordered a soft boiled egg which was fantastically soft and silky. The chashu was tender and melt in your mouth. I ordered the braised pork belly and same thing, soft and melt in your mouth.   Overall an absolute clear winner here. Toronto is extremely lucky to land this first franchise. My recommendation is to arrive 20-30 mins before it opens to ensure seating. By the way don't diss people waiting in lineups. This is very typical in Japan often waiting for hours for a 30 minute meal. ??????!"}
{"text":"One of the cities best broths.  Food: 4/5 Very yummy ramen soup. Service: 4/5 Fast even tho they are often busy. Environment: 4/5 Nice. High booths is a bit weird Washrooms: 4/5 Fine.  Worth it?: 4/5 Worth it when line is short.   At first I felt that my bowl looked one colour. Not may different items to intice you eyes but boy was I in for a surprise. I must say the clam broth is very different than what is around here. It is definitely pack with flavor. It wouldn't say this would be my new go to spot but it is definitely worth a try if you are up for something different.  The service is super fast and they do what then can to get everyone served and fed. The line up does get pretty long but we got luck because when we arrived we only waited 5 minutes. Before 5pm on a weekend doesn't seem to bad.   Overall a great experience. Not my everyday kind of ramen but I really enjoyed the clam based soup. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Waited only 30 minutes in line during soft opening. Most guests are very courteous to eat the ramen, and leave for other guests to enjoy too.  We ordered both the Shio Clam broth, and Shoryu clam broth ramen. Both of us agree the shio was a better flavour - you can taste the clam better compared to shoryu. It is not creamy like a tonkatsu, a flavourful, cleaner colour broth (reading some complaints on Yelp about this.)  We side ordered the pork belly as a side dish, rather then an accompany on the ramen.  We agreed the pork belly tasted WAY better then the chasu, and the side order is a better value if you can share it with a few people - more pieces, with a side of half an egg.   We may return when the lineup dies a bit.  Cash only at soft opening."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch (around noon) on Saturday knowing we had to wait. The hostess told us it would be approximately an hour wait which we were fine with but was pleasantly surprised when it only took 30 minutes or so (win for us!).  I ordered the intense shoyu signature clam broth ramen (with sous-vide chashu, black truffle sauce, spring onion, braised bamboo shoot, porcini mushroom sauce and leek $14) and he ordered the smoky black tonkotsu ramen (roasted garlic oil, house smoked cherry tomatoes & pork, vegetables, braised bamboo shoot, spring onion, leek and pancetta garnish $13).  Honestly, words cannot describe how delicious both ramen were. We were sharing our ramen and I thought tonkotsu would over power the shoyu ramen so much that we would no longer be able to taste the flavours and enjoy it. I was seriously wrong! The shoyu was incredibly sweet, light but yet intense clam flavours. For those who do not like the flavour of seafood, this won't be the one for you. The tonkotsu was so rich in pork flavour that I literally felt my mind being blown. The intense smokiness combined with the creaminess of the broth was seriously out of this world. The cherry tomatoes kept the bowl of ramen nicely balanced and was a nice surprise when you bite into it and the juices pop into your mouth coating it in a smoky and sweet tomato juice. The tonkotsu is heavier as it was very creamy, probably not something I'd order on a hot summer day. The Shoyu was light and sweet so great choice on hotter days!  The noodles had a slight chew to it but also very soft, silky feeling. Both broth coated the noodles so well. It was like a marriage in flavour and texture. I didn't think anything was overly oily as I wasn't reaching for the water constantly.  I was really reluctant to read the reviews prior to trying this place out because I was afraid that it'll affect the way I felt about Konjiki and I am glad I avoided reading them. Seeing that people are unhappy with the portion size, if you're looking for quantity over quality, ramen is probably not the best cuisine to have. If you're looking for a meal with tons of toppings and flavours, ramen probably shouldn't be your first choice. Observing how ramen is being served in Japan, the ingredients are minimal and do not contribute too much into the flavours of the bowl of ramen. You should be focusing on the broth and noodles. Yes, the protein and garnish should play a part in the ramen but it's meant to highlight or accentuate the bowl of ramen.  I have never been to a Michelin Star restaurant until now and am quite pleased with Konjiki. Heavenly ramen with an attractive price tag. I do not mind the wait knowing that I will be waiting x amount of time. Place is small so please plan ahead. Staff are incredibly efficient and friendly. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Go there a lot, but today we were told we won't get a table until everyone in the party are here.  I drop off my wife to get inline and I went for parking.  So they were continue giving away our table even my wife was first in the line till I get there after parked my car.  What kind of a FU*KING policy is this ???"}
{"text":"Definitely the best ramen in Toronto. The tonkotsu is a masterpiece. This is the closest you can be to the real taste of a good Japanese ramen.  If you've been to Japan you will know what I'm talking about, but if you never been to Japan, forget for a while the Japanese noodles you've tried in Canada then let you mouth experience this incredible dish."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Their ramen is average. Truffle flavour made it interesting and unique, but the pork was dry and not flavorful. Definitely not worth the long lineup. There are alot more ramen places around that are better."}
{"text":"Charles has been scoping the google maps heat map to see the hype slowly die down from 2 hour lines to no wait for the last few months. Finally got to try the most hype clam ramen in Toronto.   I was severely underwhelmed by the flavours experienced. Contrasted to rich tonkatsu, the clam broth is clear and the flavour is mainly stemming from the soy sauce.   I'm going to be 100% honest - the $15.5 INTENSE Clam broth flavour tastes like the Japanese produce Nissin instant noodles.   Not trying to downplay the recent upward skew of positive reviews for Konjiki and stick an outlier in but there is no special flavour or some magical \"subtle contrast/takes a special palette to understand the nodes of clam and soy\"  On top of that they serve a $28 lobster ramen..."}
{"text":"I attended a private tasting before the grand opening of this ramen restaurant. Before I dive into this review, as a FYI to the reader, this latest addition to the yonge street ramen invasion claims to come highly recommended by Michelin Tokyo - now that's quite a claim for a bowl of soup noodles.   We ordered the smokehouse garlic ramen and spicy ramen. The spicy ramen wasn't very spicy but the soup was delightfully creamy - almost like a cross between miso and beef broth. Let me tell you, the combination was pretty  addicting. Secondly , don't get me started about those noodles. Its rare to feast on al dente ramen noodles, the firm springiness of those noodles teamed up with that creamy soup was pretty surprising.  The smokehouse had no smoke or garlic flavour , it also had some spicy flavor to it so I highly suspect we got 2 orders of the spicy.  Now on to dessert, we ordered the matcha ice cream smores and white chocolate fondue. The matcha smores was a huge fail ! The marshmallows failed to be melty at all and instead tasted like a piece of taffy - clearly way over scorched and an unnecessary element to the dish. Maybe the ice cream cooled the marshmallows too much so it became inedible. The granola was also a distracting addition and felt like it did not belong there.   As for the white chocolate fondue..It was the extreme opposite ! It was absolutely heavenly and very unique as it appeared more like a matcha fondue. I savoured each bite and would come back for this dessert alone."}
{"text":"Wait is long so make sure to come earlier. There isn't very much room to put your bags or coats if you get a seat in the middle row. Wait for food is short but the amount in the actual ramen is microscopic compared to normal ramen portions given. However, the taste nearly makes up for it."}
{"text":"Finally able to try Kontjiki out as I refused to line up for more than 15 mins. Came here 3 other times and the lines were out the door so we left.  Was only 3 parties in front of us last night so we stayed and waited around 10 mins.  Not bad. Place is nicely decorated and staff were super friendly.  We came pretty late so a bunch of stuff were sold out.  We opted for the Intense Shoyu Signature Clam broth Ramen $14 & Mild Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen $14.  I preferred the Mild Shio which wasn't that salty but very falvorful."}
{"text":"Sansotei or Konjiki?: For me, these are the two best ramen joints in the area, and I say pay the extra few dollars for Konjiki.  The Order:  Signature Shoyu Ramen Roasted Garlic Ramen Chicken Karaage Pork Belly Don (rice)  The Reason:  Having Tried both Roasted Garlic Ramens at Sansotei and Konjiki, I can say that I liked Konjiki's roasted flavor more, but I liked the base broth more at Sansotei.  However, I really suggest not ordering this, and go for the Signature clam/chicken/pork broth. It is great!. Best tasting broth I've tasted in all of Toronto, and I easily cleaned my bowl completely.  Konjiki's bowls are also deceptively large, as it holds more than you'd think.  I was starving waiting in line for 30mins, and planned to order extra noodles if I could, but never ended up needing to. I was quite full even before getting to my rice and Karaage.  The Karaage and Pork Belly Don are also very good, but honestly don't compare to the ram8en. The pork belly don did have a nice unique ginger taste to it though. I'd rather just order two Signature Ramens next time!  Conclusion: Definitely my preferred ramen place as parking is convenient, but until the hype dies down, I'd be okay with eating Sansotei for my next craving til I can make this place a regular without the 30min waits for seating.  Also noticing im getting thirstier by the second I write this review, so don't forget to drink lots of water!"}
{"text":"Excellent shoyu ramen I had in GTA areas far! 10/10!!! Seafood soup base is mingle perfectly with shoyu. Usually I am a fan of egg noodle but this soba like noodle is very good in this setting. Add an egg which is a extra which really should be part of the noodle. Chashu were made of lean pork, unlike pork belle it is not too oily. Gyouza was so so. 7.5/10 in my opinion."}
{"text":"Worth trying but not worth the lineup.  Arrived at 11 AM on a Sunday (30 minutes before the place opened) and there was already a lineup - at least 15 people ahead of us. This is actually our 5th attempt at Konjiki for my boyfriend and I, and we finally made it inside. Seating promptly started at around 11:30. We ordered the karaage ($5), smoky black tonkotsu ($13) with egg add-on (+$1.50), and the mild shio signature clam broth ramen ($14) with sous-vide chashu add on (+$3).   You get 4-5 small pieces of karaage with wasabi mayo. It was juicy, tender, and well seasoned, but the batter kept falling off of the chicken. The smoky black tonkotsu was possibly the best tonkotsu broth I've had - it was very creamy and buttery and didn't have a gelatinous mouthfeel. It came with bamboo shoots, spring onions, black garlic oil, smoked minced pork, and two smoked cherry tomatoes with thin noodles. Wasn't a fan of the minced pork - I would have preferred the standard chashu slices and also there was not enough minced pork that came with it. The add-on egg was pretty standard, not as runny as I would have liked it and it seems to be only marinated in soy sauce. The noodles were also nothing special - there also seemed to be a LOT of noodles in the bowl and not enough toppings to go with it.  I only tried the broth of the mild shio signature clam broth ramen and it had a strong shellfish flavour. If I ever go back, I may get that one next time.  Tips:  - Wait in line before the place opens (11AM on a weekend should be good enough) to ensure that you get seats right away. I think this was the less painful way of lining up because you know you only get to wait 30 minutes compared to the 45 min - 1 hr wait when you arrive after the place opens.  - Kitchen closes at 9:30 PM (and by that time, they've probably sold out on a few items). We tried going in last minute on a Friday at 9:40 PM and we were told that the kitchen was closed.  - Limited seating, place looks like it can fit around 30-35 people. Not ideal for groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"Location/Service Right on Yonge street near The Keg and Jack Astor's. There's street parking directly on Yonge and along the side streets, lot parking is also available nearby.  Inside has a modern bright decor. Unlike other ramen places, it's very spacious but still limited seats (around 30 seats or so). Note there is a Saryo Cafe inside the restaurant, which you can order drinks and dessert as well.  Staff were friendly and quick with orders. The owner talked to us for a little bit, friendly person and approachable.   Food Ordered their signature shoyu ramen, which is a soy sauce based with a clam broth. This place stands out from other place for their clam broth. It was my first time trying it and I like how it's fresh and light. You can taste the clam in the soup. The noodles (I heard were hand made) are very nice to taste and cooked to the right level. The pork (chasu) however was a little tough and dry. They may have used a thinner part cause there's no fat (whereas other places will be soft and chewy).   The ramen does not come with an egg. I added it in for $1.50 and it was not as soft boiled as I thought. Small parts of the yolk were fully cooked, but I think this could be an easy thing to fix.   My friends ordered the shio signature ramen, which had a heavier tasting of the clam broth compared to shoyu. Although it's a little saltier, but I would recommend it.   Also order chicken karrage. Pretty standard as other places, crispy skin and soft meat. Not dry at all and it complimented well with the wasabi mayo.   Overall my experience here was good, but not great. The hype makes the waiting time (45min to 1hr) a little turned on, recommend to come on less busy hours. Price wise I thought was a little high, perhaps cause it's Michelin guided. I would come back again once the heat dies down to try their other flavors."}
{"text":"Tried the signature shoyu clam broth ramen with chashu pork.  Extras: egg, pork belly.   The breakdown: Broth: C+: extra points for the distinct flavour of clam broth versus traditional pork.  But it wasn't flavourful enough to carry through Egg: A: solid.  Perfect consistency.  Don't know why this isn't a given at most ramen places.  Chashu: D: very bland, thin, small pieces. Pork belly: B+: the pork belly was braised, which made it nice and soft.  Missing the extra oomph of a torched pork belly.  Noodles: F: I don't know what happened here.  The texture was terrible.  Way too soft.  No flavour.  Tasted almost like instant noodles.  And they give you way too much.   I was quiet excited about having more ramen options, but this place will not be making the regular circuit."}
{"text":"Great option for ramen lovers in Toronto. Konjiki just opened up recently and was originally based only in Tokyo. Prices here are relatively more expensive (on average $14 for a bowl of ramen) but the broths are rich and flavourful.  For the two of us, we ordered the signature clam broth ramen (shoyu) and the smoky black tonkotsu ramen. Both were delicious! I'd highly recommend the signature clam broth ramen if it's your first time here as that's what they are most known for.  We also got a side order of chicken karaage which was delicious as well."}
{"text":"The soup is amazing. I finished all of it and don't feel thirsty at all!  Cheese cake is great!"}
{"text":"I live nearby...so when I see a Michelin star recommended place opening up, I guess I gotta give it a try.  The lineups are always long.  I see them all the time when I'm driving by.  If you don't want to line up, start lining up at 11:15am. I did that on a Sat morning and we were about 15 ppl deep in line and one of the first group seated.  Their clam soup is what they are famous for.  It's a nice clean soup but unfortunately I'm just not a fan of it.  Also tried the Tonkotsu black and that soup was very rich and flavourful.  Its one of the better Tonkotsu Ramens in town for sure.  Service was nice, typical Japanese style politeness. But that's why I was surprised the bill seemed rushed.  Although they did not ask us to speed up, showing up with the bill and payment machine in hand while we are still eating does seem a little intrusive and ruins the experience.  It's possible I just don't know how to appreciate their signature soup base but I'm not entirely sure I was blown away by it when I walked in with Michelin star recommendation expectations.  I would definitely come again...especially for their Tonkotsu again but I'd wait until the hype dies down....I just don't think the lineup is worth it especially in this cold weather."}
{"text":"wasn't the best ramen for what it's worth...with tax and tips it's about $20 for a bowl of ramen... I might as well just go to a decent sushi restaurant and order a lunch bento box for $15 or less... not worth it, not going back"}
{"text":"So far, this is my best ramen place to go to   Went there on the grand opening (which is a coincidence) around 7pm. Waited for an hour and were told that their signature clam broth has sold out (should tell us earlier, not when we seated). We order Smoky black tonkotsu ramen and original shoyu tonkotsu ramen.   Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen ($13)   (Roasted garlic oil, house smoked cherry tomatoes & pork, vegetables, braised bamboo shoot, spring onion, leek and pancetta garnish) * pork is minced pork   Original Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen ($13)   (Sous-vide chashu pork, pickled ginger, takana pickles, braised bamboo shoot, and spring onion)  * Must Try   Add On : Tamago ($1.5)Soft boiled egg soaked in soy sauce with custard-like yolk.  Gyoza  ($5/5 pieces)  Chicken Karaage ($5/5-6 pieces)   Overall, I love food and will definitely come back for the clam broth ramen. The only thing that I will suggest is to increase the portion of ramen or have an option to add extra noodle."}
{"text":"TL;DR Does it live up to the Michelin Star ranks? Sorta. Kinda. I mean not really. It's okay? I mean sometimes it's great when you're craving that distinct CLEAN broth, but otherwise no.  FOOD (3/5)  Like I'm trying not to be biased but Ramen is so subjective. Especially in a city like Toronto.  You to to Kenzos to get full and eat great gyoza.  You go to Sansoutei because you're basic.  You go to Kinton for the noodles.  And you to to KONJIKI for Broth.  That's all there is to it for a Torontonian. Pick and choose what you want and go to the place. The star is just a name here in the 6ix let's face it. There's way too many picky people here.  SERVICR (2/5) Some of them know English superbly, the others don't. Some are nice, most are cold. They don't really pay attention to you but they do??? Like they watch you similar to vultures and wait for you to breathe your last before eating out your vocal chords. That's the kind of vibe I get here.  ATMOSPHERE (2/5) Wierd because of the vulture-like servers. I mean it's not too terribly loud but the servers kind of make me nervous lol.  THE CHEF WAS HERE RATING (???/*) Ok I was here when he was in the kitchen but I was also here when he wasn't because I wanted to see if there was a difference because of his godly starry aura and sURPRISE THERE WAS!!!  When the chef was in there was more noodles and the servers were nicer.  After he left the noodles greatly shrank in portion to the point that after eating 2 bowls of overpriced ramen.... I WAS STILL HUNGRY LIKE. WHAT???   The lobster Ramen was a SHAM LET ME TELL YOU. The lobster was so tough like wHAT DO YOU MEAN I JUST PAID $30 FOR A WATERED DOWN LOBSTER BISQUE RAMEN AND THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO SERVE ME?????  I'm just so shocked for a Michelin restaurant it's like they can't function without the chef breathing down their necks or something.  Unfortunately I keep coming back in hopes that they would stay consistent or fix things or just. Live up to the Michelin star expectation, ya know? Too bad it's a disappointment.   Goodbye Konjiki. Forever. - single tear -"}
{"text":"[Access] If you like taking the TTC, by all means ride the rocket and get off at North York Centre then walk Southbound for 2-3 minutes. If you are a lazy bum like myself and just want to drive home quickly after the meal, you can park on the streets or near a Green P parking lot. Parking after 6pm usually yields better prices. Otherwise, just carpool people!  [Service] I love going to Japanese restaurants because everyone serves like their lives depended on it. Typically, Japanese servers are super attentive and overly energetic - that's their culture. I have a feeling they employed Chinese servers too but they worked hard, so it's all cool with me. Our cups were always refilled without us asking first, and they cleared our dishes like a hurricane. They were SO FAST! Overall, I was fine with the service - great Japanese culture! The downside is that the place is small, like super tiny! You can hang purses and jackets on the hook beneath the table but that isn't super helpful in the winter times.  [Food] I gotta give it to them, the signature clam broth ramen is quite unique. You aren't going to find this anywhere else in the 416. It's definitely not too salty and you can taste the clam flavour just by sipping on the broth. Unlike other ramen restaurants, their noodles are quite firm. For those who like it soft, you won't enjoy your stay. Unfortunately eggs are an additional cost, so I didn't bother adding on top. The pork is soft, not to the point where it melts, but you could tell it went through sous-vide. If you don't know what sous-vide means, time to buy yourself one of those machines lol. Do I think it's the best pork ever? Definitely not.  I read somewhere that the chicken karage came out cold for some people - that's a big nono, it should always be hot. I was quite fond of the chicken, the skin was crunchy and the meat was super tender. The pieces were decent-sized given the price of $5. Gyoza were on point, super oiley but tasty exterior and the content inside was warm. I liked it.  I'm surprised that people gave it a low score because I would rank it above many other ramen stores. In fact, I would fathom to say it's in my top 3-4 of ramen places. It still does not beat Sansotei but it's a close 2nd or 3rd. I also really like the Black Smokey Tonkatsu ramen. Like the name suggests, it seems a bit roasted? toasted? smokey! lols. The broth is undeniably fattening but it was like a fat fat pig swimming in heaven. I know, makes no sense LOL. I will agree with the majority that this is no Michelin-star, in fact, it's not even close to most ramen chains in Japan. If you haven't been to Japan, their broth is to die for - literally! I like how hot the ramen comes, how chewy the noodles are, and how absolutely tender the pork is cooked/made. Nothing in Toronto can replicate that taste."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 others on a Saturday night and lined up for at least 30 minutes during their soft opening.   ENVIRONMENT: It was a little bit confusing for us as the front of the space is Saryo Cafe and it took us the entire time there to realize they are actually separate entities. We also mistook and went to pay for our ramen at Saryo's register. The Konjiki dining area is at the back with bar tables in the middle and tables of fours surrounding at the side. This restaurant unlike other ramen joints, does not show you how they make their ramen and the kitchen is hidden from the customers. The atmosphere is not as dynamic and lively like Kinton, where their staffs'd greet you loudly in Japanese.   FOOD: We each ordered a different ramen broth so we could all try each other's flavours together. The Signature clam broth shio was definitely the winner among the four broths we ordered. It had a very strong clam flavour and just extremely tasty. The broth was unique and unlike other broth I've tried. For me, the special Tonkotsu broth came in second, and I wouldn't mind coming in again to order this next time. It was rich and creamy, slightly heavier than the shio clam broth. But the flavour was still excellent. Smokey Black Tonkotsu was interesting and different. One might find it a bit too strong and smokey though. The signature clam broth shoyu was also decent but I found the soy sauce overpowered the taste of the clams. So I much preferred the shio better. The manager on site also gave us some pointers as we were sipping each other's broth. He told us if we took a spoonful of broth from the 3 spots where the toppings were placed, we'd be able to taste slightly different flavour. And, the broth did taste slightly different when soaked with different toppings (e.g green onions).   The pork here at Konjiki was underwhelming and tasted almost like thin slices of ham. The meal would be that much more perfect if it came with an egg and better meat.  In the end, all of us fought to finish the entire Shio broth. It was that delicious!  SERVICE: no complain here. Just right.  I'd recommend their clam broth shio and special Tonkotsu broth."}
{"text":"New Ramen shop. Had to try it. Line up was long. Means good Ramen, right? We decided to wait. We were seated and given a menu with maybe 6-8 options. Simple decision. Food came. Omg...Delish!!  Definitely recommend for dine in. They don't do take out so was a bit disappointed but I guess it wouldn't taste as good as fresh."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this Tokyo based ramen establishment. Both my friend and I tried the signature shoyu (clam broth), and man it did not disappoint. The broth was rich and full of different flavours. You could really taste the clam, but it wasn't overpowering at all. There was a hint of truffle to the aftertaste, which was a nice touch.   The karaage was good, but nothing really made it stand out over any other restaurant. In fact, I'd say I was slightly bland in comparison to the likes of Sansotei or even a lesser Kinka.   The service was the worst aspect of my experience. While both my friend and I had the same dish, his arrived almost 10 minutes earlier. The karaage, while an appetizer, arrived towards the end of our meal. I had to wave down the wait staff to get more water and tea vs their stopping in to top it up.    To summarize, ramen is great, chicken is average, service was less than good."}
{"text":"You come here to try their clam broth ramen. That's their signature and they do it well. We tried both the shoyu and shio clam broth ramen. Surprisingly the flavor is quite different. Shoyu was very intense and even though I generally really like foods with intense flavors, I found it a bit much. I preferred the shio actually. The flavor was much more delicate and you really taste the sweetness of the clams. The noodles were good but I didn't think they were amazing. I prefer my noodles more springy and chewy.  The pork was done well, just the right amount of meat to fat ratio. The other bits they add to flavor the soup really add a new dimension to ramen that is unique and made it a really interesting experience. (The shoyu tends to mask this though because of its intensity another reason why I like shio more). Yes the wait is long, but I found our servers relatively attentive and had no issues with the service once seated. Overall a great experience, we'll wait for a slower time to come back and try their tonkotsu ramen."}
{"text":"Too pricy, not worth it. I piad $13 for a bowl of ramen without egg and chasu. Thats cheap. But the way, this ramen chain is not famous at all in Japan."}
{"text":"Truly does live up to its Michelin Star rating! Like many people, I was stuck in a Friday evening dinner rush and waited around 40 minutes. It wasn't too horrible of a wait, and we were promptly seated when space opened up. It must be noted that the highlight of this ramen joint is not the variety on the menu, but rather the quality in each of their specialized dishes. Their famous clam broth had a strong clam flavour that was refreshing to try. As a soup base, it complimented the pork very well. Definitely worth trying! As for the spicy tonkatsu soup, it has just the right amount of spicy chili on the top for a subtle amount of spice to a nice creamy pork bone soup base. These two are their most recommended, and I highly recommend trying both, as they have two very different flavour profiles; one that is a clean but strong flavoured broth, and one that is rich and spicy. Beyond the phenomenal soup bases, the handmade noodles had excellent texture and taste, complimenting the soup extremely well. The noodles were cooked to the perfect consistency and were not too soft, nor too hard. I would highly recommend ordering the pork belly as a side. The cut of pork belly was extremely moist and tender, with not too much fat. This meat contrasts the lean meat used in the ramen dishes, but I would highly recommend ordering this side dish or opting to add it to your ramen in as an add-on. Unlike many other Ramen joints, Konjiki does not focus on having a huge variety, but rather on ensuring the utmost quality among soup and ramen ingredients, for an overall excellent experience! Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Loved it!! I got the Clam Broth Ramen (Shio) and the broth was relatively light, which complimented the noodles and the toppings really well. I also got their gyoza and chicken karaage, which both tasted pretty good too.  Service was polite and attentive. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I came here twice. First time I ordered the Smoky Black Tonkotsu and the second time I ordered the Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen. Both were really good.   Smoky Black Tonkotsu: Really good and rich broth. Noodles were great, chewy as expected. Didn't love having the ground pork. I normally don't get the ones with the ground pork just because it falls down and is hard to get. It did have it's own flavour.   Clam Broth Ramen: Really flavourful, definitely can taste the clam flavour right way. Didn't enjoy the pork that much. Maybe I'm just used to the pork at other ramen places, but meh. Had a slight ham flavour to it.   Definitely worth the try, but don't think it'd be my go-to ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"North York now has a new Ramen place, Konjiki. It claims to be recommended by Michelin, but I feel the service was not up to Michelin standard. The shio clam base was a delight, probably my favourite Ramen soup base in Toronto. But the price is steep. For $14.99, they don't include an egg (not even half!). With an egg added, you're looking at $20 per bowl, including tax and tips.   The shouyu base is good but salty. The karage was just okay. I would like to warn everyone about the cakes offered by the Saryo cafe portion at the front of the restaurant. The owner highly recommended the Mont Blanc...which is like $8.50. Probably the most blend cake I have had in a long while. Someone else bought a matcha cheesecake for me to try a week later, and it was equally disappointing.  In summary, I'd say the Shio Ramen is worth a try, the soup is quite remarkable. Other than that, I don't see the need to line up for 30min+ nor try any of the dessert."}
{"text":"It was worth a try but not worth of waiting in line. Price was average noodles was good. I don't really like the creamy soup base and portion of meat is very little even though it looks like few pieces of meat but very thinly cut.  The matcha soft ice cream was good I would say 4 star for that and around 3-3.5 star for the ramen. The soft ice cream bowl is really small in portion as well so might need one per person."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this ramen spot! (We've been to Japan a couple of times) I got the tonkotsu ramen and he had the black tonkotsu ramen, both very delicious. Also I love their gyoza and karaage. Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"Was here with a friend on a Friday around 5:30pm and got seated immediately! This place had been all over social media and we had heard some good things about it so we decided to check it out! Service was fine and the food arrived in a timely manner. The food..? Well.. my friend got the clam broth ramen which he said was pretty good. I got the tonkotsu and while it was \"okay\", it was waay too milky imo. It was just okay. My broth was topped off with a ground pork mixture which turned out to be chilli??? There were kidney beans and all that in it too which really threw me off. This place is worth trying it for the hype, but I won't be returning.  TLDR - Good service, food arrives quickly, place is good if you like clam-based broth."}
{"text":"One of the most unique ramen I have tasted - whole lobster, deshelled in a rich seafood broth. I could really taste the seafood in the broth and thoroughly enjoyed the perfectly cooked lobster! My friend and I got there around 6pm and since we were only a party of two, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Afterwards, we also enjoyed dessert at Saryo, which is connected to Konjiki. I would definitely go back to try their signature clam broth ramen."}
{"text":"Pros: they have a vegetarian ramen for the Canadian market, this is great!  The flavour was rich and filled with umami goodness.  The noodles had a noticeably higher quality texture than most ramen joints in Toronto, I would liken it to an almost wonton noodle mouth feel.  Cons: there is still some evidence of growing pains.  The beverages menu is modest at best (some pops, water, tea) and it is not yet licensed.  Our server also forgot a drink order.  The egg was a little overcooked, and this is the first instance that I have experienced where I was served an egg in ramen that was cold in the middle?!   I think the restaurant was honestly surprised at the overwhelming demand and the willingness of Toronto's diners to wait to try new hyped foods.  With time, I think this rating could easily go up to four stars but for now, hedge your expectations!"}
{"text":"After hearing people rave about this place we had to take a chance with the line ups and try it out for ourselves. We arrived close to 5:30 on a cold Sunday and the line up reached the doors. Luckily it moved very quickly. The staff took our name and seated us at a table by the wall after 20 minutes. There are several tables along each wall and also a couple rows of stools along a bar in the middle of the small dining room.   We are not exactly ramen experts and were unsure about the potency of the clam broth so we all ordered the spicy red Tonkotsu ramen. The hot chilies and creamy broth paired beautifully with the beef vegetables and beans. The noodles were perfectly cooked. It really hit the spot. Now I'm not sure about Michelin quality but I would definitely return for more ramen here.   I also think it's worth noting that the service here was exceptional. The man that seated us was so pleasant and polite. When we thanked our server for filling  our water he responded \"thank you\" back. I mean the politeness was off the charts. Considering how busy the restaurant was, this type of customer service is to be commended."}
{"text":"Definitely different from a regular ramen place. The broth is really aromatic and layered with many flavours you might not expect in traditional ramen. The pork is perfectly soft and tender with it's own layer of smokey flavour. It's a small restaurant yet somehow inside you feel as if you might be in a different country. Really cute experience."}
{"text":"Went there on the 3rd day after it opened. Luckily there was no line. Only had to wait a few minutes for them to clear out a table. My boyfriend ordered their signature clam broth shoyu and I ordered the Smoky black tonkotsu ramen. Broth was delicous! My favourite was the noodles! It was fresh and chewy. Something about the noodles made me want more! The smoked tomatoes added a perfect touch to it! Although, I do have to say, this ramen was great but after awhile of drinking the soup it felt a bit heavy, and I wish it came with pork chasu, instead of minced pork meat. Also, on the side we ordered some gyoza, which were delicious and juicy on the inside!   Signature clam broth (shoyu):$14 Extra egg: $1.50  Smoky Black Tonkotsu: $13 Extra egg: $1.50  Extra bamboo shoot: $1.50  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Guess the first time wasnt enough, I had to go back the second time! This time, there was already a line up before the doors even opened, so had to wait a bit with my friends till we got seated. But thanks to my friend who got there earlier or else we'd be waiting out in the cold. We were the second round of people in line. But it didn't take too long to get seated. I decided to try their signature clam broth shoyu ramen since my boyfriend said it was good when we went the first time. This broth was delicious! Can definitely taste the clams. Again, the noodles won be over! I just loved every bite of the noodles!   Signature clam broth ramen (shoyu): $14 Extra egg: $1.50 Extra pork chasu: $3.00  Forgot to take a picture of the ramen!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Overall, love their ramen. Portions size are great, friendly workers, and food does not take long to come! It is on a bit of the pricier side, especially after adding some extras to it.  But to have it once in a  while to treat yourself, it's okay,  right? Haha   This place is attached to a cafe that I have yet to try because I was too full both times. Hopefully next time!   Also, on their website it tells you the steps on how to eat their ramen. Make sure you check it out!"}
{"text":"The rating is purely based on the food. I'd give it a 4, but this place is so hyped up and my expectations for the food were that much higher. I was literally expecting to be mind-blown, or to have a foodgasm or something and can't wait to order a second bowl or come back next time. But none of that occurred. The food is not bad, but...did not satisfy the expectations I had placed on it. I would even consider giving it a 2 simply because it did not meet expectations.  The restaurant has capacity for maybe 30 people. They've got bar seats down the middle and tables along the sides. There are boxes containing utensils and cups holding napkins. Self-service, never have to wait if you drop your chopsticks on the floor.  Service is overall pretty good. To me anyways. Waitresses walk around and check up on you for water re-fills. They only accepted cash at this point during the soft opening because presumably they didn't have a machine set up, and sometimes they got the change wrong which may be quite a problem but they apologize without contesting your claim.  Washrooms have an accessible sign, but for some reason they do not have an automatic door installed. However, the men/women signs do have braille under them. I just found these details to be quite curious.  The menu is pretty simple, and on the back they've stuck on a couple drinks. Soft-opening, so I guess this is to be expected. UNLESS, that is meant to give a more of authentic feel?  I ordered the signature clam based broth with shoyu. When it arrived, my first impression was it's a pretty bare bowl of noodle soup. My fault cause I didn't add any extra toppings, but even then, you were presented with 3 pieces of chashu and a couple pieces of bamboo along with some garnish.  The noodles were nice and chewy. They had flavor as well. The amount of noodles you get relative to the size of the bowl is not bad either, but for the most part if you don't add extra toppings, it's pretty much just a bowl of noodles if you don't pace yourself.  The broth contained what I presume is truffle oil (I don't usually dine at places that offer truffles), and the flavor really stood out for me. I did not enjoy it with soy sauce as much: it reminded me so much of the wonton soup that I would get from chinese places in chinatown. The broth also did not come hot; no steam or anything, so you don't have to worry about taking time with your pictures since it's not hot anyways.  I enjoyed the chashu. At other ramen places in toronto, the chashu I've had is usually well-cooked (or over-cooked). This one had an enjoyable texture to it given how thin it is and how long it had been cooked. Flavor was good. Nice to chew on. Would be nice if it was a bit bigger, but you'll never be satisfied with the size for what you're paying I suppose so you'll just have to settle with what you have or ask for extra chashu.  Despite the size of the bowl, it was surprising satisfying as I wasn't on the hunt for something else to eat afterwards.  Also ordered a plate of chicken karaage. For $5, you got 4 small pieces of chicken. The chicken was tender and juicy, but it's about the same as all the other ramen places (that offer more chicken, or offer them for cheaper). Well, this place does have the brand so I guess a premium price is to be expected.  Eh...hard to say. Wouldn't line up 30-40 minutes for it. It's not bad, but with all the other ramen places in the area, I don't think they've got that much of a competitive advantage beyond the brand since the portions are smaller, prices are higher, and wait times can be absurd. But who knows, perhaps I am used to commoner food and cannot fully appreciate this particular bowl of ramen as the michelin judges have."}
{"text":"Konjiki has officially became one of my favourite ramen places in town! I don't usually drink the soup when I have my ramen, but this intense shoyu clam broth was so delicious I couldn't stop drinking it. It was sweet and flavourful yet not overpowering. It has the right balance that you can taste the black truffle flavour. Highly recommended!  Food: Intense Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen - Sous-vide chashu, black truffle sauce, spring onion, braised bamboo shoot, porcini mushroom sauce & leek - $14  Drink: Asahi 16oz - $9.50   Follow me on instagram @eatwithJoT for more pictures and reviews :)"}
{"text":"So sad the ramen didn't come with an egg and I had to pay extra for it.. BUT IT WAS SO WORTH IT. That was entirely the highlight of the meal for me.  Shio/shoyu clam broth ramen? A-ok. Tastes just fine - not spectacular but I wouldn't mind eating it again. BUT THE EGG? DAMN. It just worked its way up to the top of my list of favourite Japanese soft boiled eggs. Cooked perfectly to have a soft but structured outer egg white to encompass a gooey but not runny custard-like yolk that's then marinated in soy sauce - ooooof, it was SO good.   100% would come back just to have the egg again."}
{"text":"Ordered signature shio and shoyu. Before I was done washing my hands it was out on my table. Really fast service.   Shoyu was only ok. Shio broth was much better and had a nice clam flavor. Thin sliced sous vide pork belly was moist but bland. Bamboo shoots were spot on.   Cash only for now. Would repeat if there was no lineup."}
{"text":"This place has a long way to go if they plan on living up to the reputation of their restaurant in Japan. First off, the patrons lining up for a table would ask the staff how long the wait would be and they would respond with \"I don't know\". What kind of customer service is that? If you don't know find someone who does, answer with some useful information, even a timeframe would be better than saying nothing.  The signature clam ramen itself has a very clean broth without the fatty richness compared to restaurants like sensotei or kinton. The noodles also did not have the same rubbery \"bit\" as well. The clam flavour was very subtle.  The staff also forgot to place my fried chicken order and it came out after we finished our ramen.   In summary I wouldn't go back to this place over other ramen restaurants in Toronto. I much prefer richer broth and the noodles of ramen restaurants."}
{"text":"Heard lots of good things about this restaurant.  We are huge ramen fans so we were excited to check it out.  Finally made it tonight.... and I have to say it was disappointing.  Food came out fast, but appetizers came out way after the main.  I ordered the spicey ramen and my husband had the mild clam based broth.  The clam broth was nice but theportions were very small.  And they also charge for hot sauce as well which was a little surprising for an Asian restaurant.  Not a huge deal but they should at least tell you that's the case .  The staff were really friendly but they kept spilling water on my friend.  Lol. Overall it was just ok.  It's not somewhere I'd revisit I think.  Too many other place worth a try before I return for a round 2"}
{"text":"Great service & organized management overall with the large lineups / crowds on a daily basis. Came on a monday afternoon and luckily only had to wait 15mins. Michelin star recommended but i think its way overhyped.  Dont think the broth/noodles were hot enough. Soup was good in taste but i would not line up or crave to come back anytime soon. Tried the vegetarian option which was made from soy milk - very interesting & enjoyed the broth with less sodium & fat in general. I think if it was milk based it would taste even better!"}
{"text":"Clam/shellfish/chicken/pork broth was very good, with the clam taste being subtle but apparent. My husband and I got the shio and shoyu plus gyoza and braised pork belly as we were hungry. Gyoza was as expected, nothing out of the ordinary. Pork belly was good but meat could've been made slightly more tender (it was tender, just it could be MORE tender).   Overall, I enjoyed the ramen noodles and broth but the portion size was not adequate. For value and taste, I'd rather go to Kenzo Ramen.   Tip: small place so if you don't want to line up go on weekdays between 2-4pm. Or, go line up by 11:15am as they open at 11:30am."}
{"text":"I'm a Ramen snob...it's a Death Row dish for me. Konjiki is good, not great. Their Karaage IS great but their Ramen is so-so.   I'm particularly offended by having to purchase an egg for my Ramen. I've had (literally) hundreds and hundreds of bowls in my time, and can't remember having to pay for a staple ingredient like a boiled egg before. What's next? Pay extra for noodles?"}
{"text":"Another Ramen joint! I am glad I went and give this place a try...  First off, we went today (sat) and there is already line up before it opened at 11:30 am. So I guess just have a mental prep there could be line up when you try.  Looks like the famous one here is the ramen with clam broth. From looking into the menu, the broth is made with chicken and clam so we give this one a try. We tried the first two item from the ramen menu (shio and shoyu). When the ramen arrived, the ramen is very hot- good! And the shio one, the soup is very good with clam flavoured and also scented with truffle (smell like) which goes so well together. The broth is light and flavourful so most importantly at the end, it taste good! The other item in the bowl of ramen include pork, bamboo are typical quality but the broth is the best. I will come again for sure.  As for the shoyu one, it's similar to the shio one but flavoured with soy sauce. I do find the shoyu flavour over power the clam flavour. This bowl of ramen is still good but I personally prefer the Shio one.  The ramen is abit pricey I think- $14 and portion is rather small. So if u r a big eater, may not be enough to fill your tummy. But that means u will have room for dessert and latte from the store in the same area. :)  -----updates  Went today again and tried the smoke pork one... it's very good also but for ppl who go there the first time, recommend to try Shio first in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen, top notch. 10 out of 10, if you want to eat some good ramen, come here. The Broth, noodles and proteins are are seasoned beautifully, makes you want to go home and make babies, best ramen."}
{"text":"The staffs are really proactive and the food is really good : ). Ordered the clam broth noodle and he signature special tonkotsu ramen. The broth is flavourful, the noodle is chewing. There is a huge hype around it, doesn't live up to the full hype, but it's really good. The line up is long tho."}
{"text":"My friend and I took a little road trip (i.e. drove to north York) to check this place out and weren't disappointed.   Vegetarians and pescetarians, rejoice: the veg ramen ($14) at Konjiki is not your typical phoned-in lacklustre miso situation. The base is a thick, rich, creamy potato and soy milk soup. Tofu nuggets and a variety of vegetables (corn, spinach, pickled beets, yam, mushrooms) round it out and make it a much more filling and flavourful meal than expected. I couldn't have this regularly but if I need a warm comforting hug of a lunch, it's a great option. Adding an egg ($1.5) is the smart thing to do even though it means it's going to be a relatively pricy bowl of noodles after tax and tip.  My dining companion - Toronto's premier noodle expert, usually picky with ramen - was thrilled with her signature clam broth shoyu bowl."}
{"text":"Keep in mind I went during their soft opening.   As many have mentioned the ramen doesn't come out hot, and the noodles don't have much texture, which are small details. But the famous clam broth itself is what was most disappointing. Perhaps it is just a difference in style. The clam broth is clear, non-greasy, and low-salt, which is in stark contrast to a lot of the competition. The taste is subtle.   Their incredible reputation, the fact that I went during the soft opening and their association with the new dessert place Saryo means I will return to try the other broths."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, I use to walk by it everyday and couldn't wait for it to open.   It's suppose to be Michelin level ramen, but I was very very disappointed. They seem to have diluted the soup broth to cater North American tastes. The soup could have been good but it was just not salty enough. The noodles were pretty good but it doesn't make up for the broth.   We ordered the spicy red tonkotsu and the smokey black tonkotsu ramen, they don't come with any garnishes so remember to order extra meat or egg if you want some in your ramen. We weren't aware of this fact but I kind of expect the waitress to tell us because ramen normally comes with all the garnishes. We also ordered the karage chicken which was pretty good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Located beside a Jack Astors restaurant. Ramen shop shares space with a dessert store. Half of the restaurant is \"bar seating\". Service was quick and courteous. Food was decent but the broth was very good (I got the strong ramen and the oyster taste was very obvious. My partner got the original ramen and the chicken broth was very good). Well designed restaurant... Nice small details (under the table hooks for bar seating, porcelain broth spoons) show attention to detail"}
{"text":"Konjiki Ramen comes from Japan and is Michelin-recommended for their ramen and clam-based soup base. We waited in line for a total of exactly one hour from 12:20 to 1:20 p.m.  There was a long hallway into KR which also shared the space with a Japanese dessert cafe, Saryo Tokyo Cafe & Dessert.  I wish KR organized their line-ups better and in an organized fashion.  The entrance to both the ramen restaurant and dessert cafe had a small vestibule between the main door and the second door (probably used to keep out the wind) where people were waiting in line before we could actually go into the restaurant to join the line-up.   As it was a cold day, we were told by a staff member who kept coming up to the door to tell us to keep the second door closed. However, this meant that it was unclear on who was actually \"next\" in line for those standing in that little vestibule because once the second door opened, we tried to enter through the door if there was space to get in line for the ramen.  However, it didn't help that it was lunch time and a certain patron was cranky about people \"butting\" in front of her. It certainly didn't give off a very good impression of the line-up process at KR.  When we finally got past the awkward waiting part of the vestibule and were actually in the line, we heard the hostess calling out names for parties to be seated. We heard \"Jon for 2!\" or \"Ann for 3!\" and I felt immediately anxious because we hadn't given our names or given a place in the line at all.  We had been waiting all along though. What if other people had gone in front of us to get their name in the list and we weren't on it because we were just simply waiting in the line?  Thus I walked up to the front of the line to inquire. The people who were at the front of the line informed me that I had to put my name down with the hostess who was carrying the clipboard.  Okay... so how come no one told us that then? So I walked over to the female hostess who was holding a clipboard to ask her about putting my name in the list.  She wasn't very pleasant because she sternly told me to return to the line and that she'd approach me about putting my name down on the list once she got to me. Again, it didn't make for a polite nor good first impression of the restaurant.  We continued waiting in line. It took another couple of minutes before we saw the hostess finally asking people in front of us and down the line what their names were and putting their party numbers down. Finally! Finally we were put in place on the list (and given a menu to look at while we continued waiting in line). Why couldn't she have done that sooner to ease the frustration from waiting in a line that could easily have been misconstrued by the hoards of people waiting around? They definitely should organize their line-ups better.  Like I said, it took us a full hour of waiting before we were called in for a seat.  We got a table near the wall in the middle of the room. I was surprised that the seating wasn't cramped inside.  I liked the decor.  Our bowls of ramen came out surprisingly fast! I found that the staff were overly nice and friendly.  I got the Mild Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen which had sous-vide chashu (pork), porcini mushroom sauce, white truffle oil, diced arugala, pea shoot, basil and red onion, braised bamboo shoot, leek, and pancetta to garnish.    I appreciated that the menu actually taught us how to enjoy the clam broth ramen in four steps.  I really liked the signature clam broth! It was so light and refreshing.  It was so much lighter than any other ramen broth I've had before (since those are usually made with pork instead).  Upon nearing the bottom of the bowl, I definitely tasted the saltiness/ocean feel of the clams too.  Since the soup was made with clams, it was also not fatty at all (also a rarity among most ramen broths)!  I liked the ramen!  They were fine and grainier than most ramen noodles and tasted very light and fresh. The sous-vide chashu was very thin in texture and smooth.  It wasn't heavy either.  I liked the bowl overall and the portion was just enough for me.  The Vegetarian Ramen included the house-made creamy potato soy milk soup base with roasted corn, yams, pickled beets, tofu nuggets, mushroom, spinach, and olive oil.  The ingredients made it a really colourful bowl and the white soup base definitely stood out against the veggies. I liked the soup base as it was so creamy and milky. It was actually even more flavourful than my Shio broth.  I tried the pickled beet too and it was hard in texture but very sour and indeed pickled. The tofu nugget was mushy and tiny.   I liked KR overall and the quality of the ramen and soup bases.  I would definitely want to return and try their other bowls. I just hope that next time I won't have to line up for an hour and that they have an improved organized way of getting their guests in a logical line-up."}
{"text":"I'll be very upfront here: I was expecting more due to all the hype surrounding this restaurant.     Please note that there seems to be some miscommunication about the \"Michelin\" status of this restaurant. It's not a Michelin star restaurant; rather, it's a Michelin bib gourmand restaurant. This still means something, of course, but please take this into account so that your expectations aren't skewed.  After a long 1-hr wait in the winter cold, my group of 3 was finally seated.  The first thing I noticed was how tiny the aisle space was compared to most restaurants. With the servers zipping back and forth, they were always close to bumping into me and my stuff, so I had to constantly look back to ensure this didn't happen.  It seems the floor plan was designed to maximize the number of people who could be served in such a small amount of square footage instead of enhancing the comfort of the diners and staff. My take on this: terrible, especially if there was a fire hazard or if you're extra sensitive about personal space.   I tried the Signature Clam Broth Ramen.  Konjiki gets brownie points for serving a broth that we don't usually see here in the GTA.  It was very light with a subtle soy sauce undertone to add depth.  Personally, the flavour was lacking for me and the toppings and noodles were average, so I could neither justify the hype nor the long wait.  I tried my bf's Tonkotsu Ramen and it didn't stand out compared to other tonkotsu ramens we've had in Toronto either.  My bf also had the chasu add-on, but he only received 2 slices.  He admitted he was kinda disappointed because he often gets 3 or more at other restaurants for this add-on.  On the bright side, my friend who dined with us that night really enjoyed his Signature Clam Broth Ramen and Karaage appetizer, so it could be all up to your personal palette.   Whereas my friend will be returning when the line dies down, I'll probably be passing on another round here.    Pros:  - Michelin bib gourmand   - The only ramen restaurant I know that has a clam broth    Cons:  - lines aren't well-managed  - very tiny aisle space, so you could get your stuff knocked off or bumped into any time (bad if you want personal space)   - clam broth was too light, leaning towards bland for me   - noodles and toppings were of average quality   - Tonkatsu Ramen was average compared to other restaurants' version"}
{"text":"This happens every time there is a new \"hyped-up\" restaurant in town. People set their expectations high and hope to taste sunshine and dreams in their meal - when really, it's just ramen.   It's one of the best ramen I've had in Toronto. I don't get why everyone is so disappointed. I got the spicy red tonkatsu ramen, as well as karage chicken and gyoza to share. The noodles were prefect, and the broth was hearty and delicious. I really want to try their speciality next time. Although...the karage chicken was a bit greasy and the gyoza was same as anywhere else.   The service was good, and the servers were attentive and quick. I went in on a Monday at 4 pm, and they were nearly full. I'm curious to see how they hold up over the next year. Given the location, I expect it to do well.   I highly recommend it, because it is very good. Just because it's affiliated with \"Michelin\"... don't go in with obscene expectations."}
{"text":"This did not disappoint. From $1.50 green tea (the best I've ever had) to the $14 ramen - out of this world, I would go here time and time again. The restaurant is clean and the servers were so nice. Service was very fast and I even got a special egg on the side for $1.50 too. The noddles were outstanding, a bit al-dente and I finished the broth right down to the bottom. I never do that with ramen, this one blew me away."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this ramen spot! It is different compared to al the other ramen places I've been to. The clam broth is so unique and the noodles are freshly made daily. A bowl is about $15 but totally worth it, I like how the broth has a nice creamy earthy taste and the noodles are perfectly a la dente. Would have loved the pork slices to be a bit bigger but I guess it's cut thinly to go with the refined look of the soup. We also ordered the gyoza which was absolutely delicious and the chicken karage (not so bad). I would definitely go back again and maybe try their lobster ramen and hopefully save some room for the in house dessert shop. When you go, expect to wait 15-20 mins because there's usually a line but it goes quickly!"}
{"text":"I learned from Instagram that today will be the first day of launching the lobster ramen. Starting this Wednesday, available every Wed only. Limited quantity, the waitress told me 100 in the afternoon and 100 for dinner.  My highly anticipated lobster ramen since the opening of Konjiki. I was looking forward to this all day.   Arrived at 6:34pm and sat down at 7:01pm. I came alone, so the larger your party, the line is a little longer.  Drumroll, this lobster ramen have many layers of flavours. From the house made lobster cream reduction to the Soup base: lobster shellfish, pork, chicken, red miso, cream plus lobster oil. The rainbow of flavour was amazing, better than any lobster bisque.   The whole fresh de-shelled lobster was nice in terms of texture when you bite into it. Thick and meaty! I finished the entire bowl. I've also ordered the tofu nugget as-well. But of course the second my lobster ramen landed, I pushed the appetizer away. Will definitely return for more lobster ramens on Wednesday's- new hump days foodie motivation to continue on with the week   18-June-2018 I came here to try out the lobster Gyoza. One word to describe \"Phenomenal\" the sauce was like a nice fresh boiled down lobster bisque. Not any lobster bisque but a good heavy duty one.   I ate a clam ramen and order a set of 4. It was for $7.50. I find it very reasonably priced for the amount of lobster they stuffed in it. After I finish 4, I have to order another 4 to go and licked the lobster sauce plate clean. Amazing. Just made my Monday. I am happy now. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Arrived with a hungry friend right at opening; left hungry. We did not have to wait for a table, but unfortunately on the day we visited, a Wednesday, we were informed that only 3 types of ramen were available - the lobster special ($28) and two standard items. Because my friend is a vegetarian, and our server told us that they would not be serving the vegetarian ramen, we had to leave with empty stomaches. A strange choice by the restaurant to go with such a limited menu. I did grab a delicious ice cream from Saryo on the way out to enjoy with the snowy flurries outside and promised to return another time."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm completely aghast that the hype surrounding this place could have been so wrong. I was utterly disappointed to even think I'd want to try them in Japan at all.   There are a number of superior ramen houses in Toronto, and this place ranks near the bottom.   The next time I walk by and it there isn't a line up, I still wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen in the GTA. Besides the common creamy based soup, tonkatsu, they also known for their calm based soup which is my all time favourite. The mild calm soup ramen is so delicious. It isn't the most photogenic ramen but probably the best tasting. The lines get really long since it is a Michelin star rated place for really affordable price. So I suggest you go before 5pm, dinner is really busy. Im not the biggest fan of ramen in general but you won't regret this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen although pricey. I got the clam soup ramen (shio) while bf got the shoyu tonkatsu ramen. Their broth is very unique and definitely differs from other joints, it was flavorful which I liked. Noodles were chewy and went great with broth. There was no egg in their ramen though which is a bit disappointing.   It was very busy when we went and had to line up about 15min. Like most other places, tables are tiny and crowded. If you can come without lining up I think it's worth a try."}
{"text":"The hype is... Well hype. Would I recommend waiting in line or go out of your way, no. But, if you're in the area and you want to experience a unique clam broth with your ramen, check it out. Broth was delicious. Noodles were just meh. Price is average for ramen IMO. We also had the fried chicken, which was served with a mustard sauce which was good. Service there was also good."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen I have tried.  Very flavorful broths.  We had to wait 45 minutes for a table but it was worth it.  Their 2 signature desserts were good.  I would have prefer if we could order the desserts at the table."}
{"text":"For someone who usually likes strong flavoured broth, surprisingly I am a fan! Konjiki's signature broth is nice and light with hint of clam. One star off since the ramen is a bit expensive and wait times are long."}
{"text":"Came here coz my friend saw a fb advert of this restaurant featuring 1 star michillen chef from Japan.  Our first attempt was a fail, as The lineup was so long we couldn't see the seating area and ppl were waiting outside in the street in minus 15 weather (windchill probably -26). We couldn't wait any longer so gave up.   Last week we decided to go during lunch hour. We were lucky and got there before the door opened. While waiting, we noticed ppl started to line up behind us.  Don't know if they were repeat customers or there to try.  It was a weekday so you can tell we Torontonians are dedicated foodies lol.  Since we were the first, we got seates very quickly. I found that the service was quick, perhaps too quick. The wait staff seem to really want to hurry us along the process of ordering and getting the whole thing over with.  I suppose this is so they can reduce the line up (ppl continue to pile in).   The decor is simplistic, with large soup pot labeled with the kojiki logo lining on the shelf. There were tables as well as noodle bar style seatings.  Their signature ramen is clam based, which is very different from the typical ramen you'd get.  While i like the broth, i think my preconception of what ramen should be like may have prevented me from appreciating it as much.  For me, i probably would have like the clam broth on its own.   The noodle were thin noodles. They were nicely textuered as all properly done ramen should.  They do not have the choice of thick or thin noodles though, and the bowl only came with the cha su pork and few pieces of bamboo, no egg. For 14 dollars, its slightly steep compared to other ramen places.    As we were leaving, we noticed that one corner of the shop is actually occupied by a cake/sweets shop, they are 2 separate businesses and even though they share the space, You can't order the dessert for after meal. The desseet corner is pretty empty comparrd to the ramen shop. I wonder why they'd rent the space like this.   Anyways, i spoke to some friends afterward, and found out that the michilen chef is only here for a month to see the shop open, and afterwards he will leave everything to the owner to run It. It seems like this is a kind of part-owner/franchise setup.   While the food is pretty decent, i feel theres more hype. I would probably go back one more time to try their pork based ramen but will not be lining up."}
{"text":"I'm confused about the hype around this place. I was in the area and stopped by for a bowl of ramen...luckily, the line was not long and I was seated within 30 mins. Upon hearing numerous reviews, I decided to try the intense shoyu signature clam broth ramen. All 4 of us ordered the same bowl, in hindsight we probably should've diversified our orders.   The ramen was good, but nothing to write home about. The noodles itself lacked the \"bounce\" I typically look for and was a bit too soft for my liking. The broth was good, definitely different from any other ramen I've had. Although priciest of any ramen I've had, the portion was the smallest...I was still hungry after my bowl."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing.  It's hard to get a table for more than 2 people here! It appears that most people come in pairs, and the only have about 10ish tables, and a high top for about 16 people. Of course, pairs get the priority cause it's easier to sit them down. For a table of four, you have to actually wait for a table of four to leave. If you're lucky, and two pairs leave side by side, you might get seated.   Last call is 9:30pm, as they close at 10pm! There's also a last call for the dessert place beside them as well.... however, there's no warning for that. After waiting in line and being forced to stare at all the dessert, I didn't get any to lighten this experience and excite my palate after my mediocre experience.   The Intense Clam Ramen was very good, but the Original and the Spicy Red ramen had a milky base that was unexpectedly strong. The Spicy Red was not spicy at all..... on top of that, as a fan of steaming hot food, the soup was only warm.  The noodles were firm! No choices like the other ramen spots.   The Clam and Original came with two slices of pork but the Red came with pork bits with some beans. Compared to the other ramen places, this made it fairly overpriced in our opinion. Moreover, stick to the Signatures.   The Pork Belly with Egg was a good value, and the Karaage was freshly fried. The Tamago was on par - very standard.   For people who need quick service, they were able to ace that aspect. You can be in and out of there within 45mins of getting seated. Their staff are very nice as well, but I went for the food. So I can't give this a good rating, but I can't give them less than two for the minor pros."}
{"text":"Long wait times.  Uncomfortable sitting in the middle bench with no place to hang up winter jackets. Good ramen, beer not cold enough.  Very tasty pork belly. Worth one hour wait? No  but overall good food,just not a nice sit down relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"Loved their ramen! We had the clam broth shoyu ramen and Gyozas and it was delicious. Fast service, friendly staff and good food !!! Will be back again"}
{"text":"The spicy tonkatsu was the shit. The broth was so opaque that I didn't have to face my sad reflection as I om n'omed n'omed my way to the bottom of the bowl.   The broth was so thick and creamy, with a nice punch of umami flavour in the first bite. The minced beef was seasoned so well with almost a subtle acidity, opposite to the creamy broth. And the noodles were springy af - completely still chewy in the warm broth. PERFECT for a cold, rainy, cloudy day. For $13 - worth.  My date got the shoyu clam broth and upon that first sip, I could've tasted the sea.   Wait was short-ish (15 minutes) and service was FAST. Would wait up to 30 minutes for this. Now that the hype has died down a little bit, it's made its worth as a staple in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times.  Both were for lunch.  First time I had the clam broth shio ramen.  Their broth is different from Sansotei or Kinto.  It's a clear broth that you can literally drink it on its own.  That's how good it was.  The noodles were al dente.  I am a slow eater and the noodles were still good at the end.  The chashu was so so.  It was lacking some flavours and I was expecting it to be more tender (because it's sous vide).   The portion was kind of small.  I felt hungry after 2 hours.  The second time I tried the shoyu clam broth.  It's still good but not as good as the shio.  I found that the shio has a stronger clam taste, which is what I like.  I added an egg this time but it was disappointing.  The egg was over-cooked.  The yolk was almost well done.  This time the portion was bigger.  I don't know if they have a different chef this time or what, but I am happy with the portion.   I also had the chicken karaage both times.  The chicken was juicy and the batter was light.  It's really good but a bit pricey at $5 for 5 pieces.  I will probably come back again when there's no line up."}
{"text":"There is nothing like ramen in Japan but this Toronto chain comes pretty close. I'm a fan of the clam broth ramen because it's unique from all the other ramen restaurants. The soup has a very clean taste, the chasu is soft and tasty and the noodles are fresh. Going on a weeknight might help to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Come here when you don't have to wait in line for too long. Avoid dinner times as the wait can be over an hour. Large parties will also have to wait a long time too, so plan your visit accordingly.   I got lucky when I arrived. There was a short line and was seated within 15min. It's not a big restaurant so hence the usual long wait. Service is similar to any other ramen restaurants. Green tea however is extra charge rather than complementary.   Ordered the intense shoyu signature clam broth ramen. It looks small but it satisfies. . Noodles are good. The sous vide Chashu wasn't as soft as I had thought, but that's fine and was still enjoyable. The chashu was cut pretty thin though; it would be nice if they gave you 3-4 pieces instead of 2. The clam broth was pretty good - it is their signature clam broth after all. I prefer the mild shio clam broth because you can taste the clam. The intense shoyu broth has a deeper flavor profile, with the clam taste masked by the soy sauce.   I thought the bowl of ramen was good. Not blow-your-mind good, but solid good. I would come back if the wait was not so long."}
{"text":"TL;WR (too long, won't read):  Great ramen that's not overwhelmingly salty. The special tonkatsu is a must buy - even more so if you're a fan of creamy broths. The clam ramen stays true to it's title with a burst of clam favour. Expect to lineup  beforehand in most situations as there are no reservations. Avg. price is around $13.5 per bowl and they have a vegetarian ramen.  Hella long but should read:  I came here on a Sunday at around 5 pm, and as expected there was a lineup all the way up to the entrance. Didn't die down as time went on, only got longer. Late afternoon might be a good time to drop by this place. Before you enter the ramen space, you get to see a small cafe that serves up your typical Japanese cafe Matcha/Hojicha desserts. Solid move to put a tempting dessert place at the front of the establishment to torture everyone waiting in line because I'm sure that it would attract people to buy something while they wait. Personally, I was very tempted to get a matcha soft serve during the 30-40 mins I waited in line.  My friend and I were seated in the island bar-like section in the middle. My friend got Konjiki's signature clam shoyu ramen ($14). The broth is a combination of clam, chicken and pork - though the clam flavour is profoundly pronounced. If you're a fan of seafood/shellfish, would recommend. It was topped with some bamboo shoots, onions, scallions, chashu and a dab of truffle sauce/Mushroom oil concoction. I expected the broth to lack impact but the small sip I had was full of flavour - to a point where it might be too much towards the end of the dish. My friend mentioned that the noodles were great as well, which was contradictory to some of the previous Yelp reviews I've read prior to my dining experience. This dish is a solid 3.5/5 for me but would probably be better for a shell fish lover.  I got the special tonkatsu shoyu ramen. I'm a huge fan of tonkatsu ramen and this ramen is now in my top 3 for sure! The broth was creamy and wasn't too salty. Most tonkatsu ramen tend to be a bit overwhelming towards the end because of the saltiness but this was just right. It comes with bamboo shoots, scallions, a lean piece of pork, pickled red ginger and mustard greens (love me some mustard greens). I also added an egg($1.50) and some braised pork belly($3.00) cus....why not. The egg wasn't in the best shape but once I cut it open the egg yolk was runny, just as I prefer it. The pork belly is probably the most worth it for the price, you're given 3 pieces that are cooked well but I recommend letting it rest inside the hot broth for a bit before you dig in because it  becomes melt in your mouth tender. I was able to wipe the bowl clean! I give this one a solid 4.5/5  We also got some karaage - which took a while to arrive as we later found out that the kitchen didn't receive the order. The waitress was really apologetic as she made sure to let the kitchen know if our order. Service throughout the whole experience other than that minor mishap was, and everyone was really  with a wasabi mayo. The fried chicken wasn't anything special but the wasabi mayo makes it a lot better. Overall 3/5.  Deciding to try Konjiki for myself despite some questionable reviews was definitely worth it. They even have a vegetarian ramen that will satisfy the needs of your vegetarian friends! I'll definitely be back to see if it has the \"consistently good\" factor."}
{"text":"Came to this Michelin recognized ramen house to see if it really lives up to the hype, but sadly the only major difference I saw was the price. We came around 3 pm to purposely avoid the prime lunch and dinner hours but still waited around 20 mins for a table. The tables are spaced very far apart (a good thing usually, but not when you have to wait so long for a table because of insufficient seating). Also noticed the servers are very slow in cleaning the tables once the customers leave, resulting in a slow turnaround and even longer wait times.   We ordered the Signature Clam Broth Shio Ramen ($14), Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen ($13) and Braised Pork Belly Don Rice ($6). Unlike every other ramen restaurant, the egg is an extra $1.50 here. When we ordered, the server asked us if we wanted water or green tea without telling us that the tea is an extra $1. Compared with Kinton ramen, I can get the same Shio ramen with char-siu, egg, and complimentary tea for $10.99 instead of $16.50 here (that's 50% more expensive)! I don't mind paying extra for premium ramen, but nickel and diming customers over egg and tea is ridiculous.  The signature shio ramen was good, and you can definitely taste the clam broth, but I found it a little too watery. I much prefer the creamier and thicker smoky black tonkotsu broth. I would have to say the broth here is the only thing better than the other regular ramen places (Kinton, Kenzo, Santosei, etc...). However, after drinking most of the broth, I was extremely thirsty in the evening. So likely the broth was loaded with salt. The noodles are decent, but I think I prefer the other places. The extra $1.50 egg was slightly undercooked and more on the raw side rather than the usual soft-boiled creamy consistency. The char siu was extremely lean and had no flavor at all. Very bland and wasn't good. The pork belly rice on the other hand was overly fatty and half of the meat was pure fat that we didn't eat.  The only thing this place does well is the ramen broth. For everything else, I would prefer my nearby Kinton ramen. I'm not going to pay for parking, wait so long to get a table, and pay 50% more just for a marginally better broth and sacrifice the juicy char-siu that I can get elsewhere. Was good to try but unlikely will come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to ramen  place! The broth is rich and flavorful. I even went twice in a week! We got the dark (saltier) and light shoyu (just right saltiness) clam broth and black tonkotsu ramen (creamy!).   P. S. Their gyoza is good too but nothing out of the ordinary. So really come for the RAMEN!   P. P. S. Any comments on the lobster ramen? Is it worth the price?"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to attend a pre-opening event at Konjiki Ramen before their grand opening next month.The concept is quite unique where they combined two prominent Japanese brands in the same location. Ramen meets dessert where the brands excel in their respective specialties. The owners were nice and told the story of how they brought these brands from Japan.   The master ramen chef Atsushi Yamamoto was overseeing the night by preparing a variety of ramen bowls for all the attendees. I was told that he taught the two other ramen chefs that opened the only 2 Michelin star restaurants. Although his restaurant was only Michelin recommended, his restaurant is highly regarded by the local critics to be the top ramen place in Japan. He will be at this location for the first 2 months of opening so get there when he is still in Toronto to witness the magic.  I tried the smokey ramen and it was different from any other places that I have been in the area. The soup base and noodles were done perfect despite being sample size. There are some minor adjustments to the ingredients but it is completely understandable as it was a pre-opening tasting and the kitchen staff were still refining their dishes given a new kitchen and suppliers. The owners told me that they will focus on unique high quality dishes as an affordable luxury for everyone to enjoy.   Despite the restaurant still finishing the final touches before its official opening, everyone enjoyed the night. I am especially excited to return when they will be serving lobster ramen and another surprise dish that is only available on the weekends in limited quantities. The owners, staff and the chefs were particularly open to our feedback throughout the evening so they can adjust their dished to our Canadian taste buds.  I really appreciated the owners spending time to chat with the group and telling their story along with accepting our feedback with open arms. I hope that the line will not be long when it opens but I'm afraid I need to accept the fact that it will be."}
{"text":"We went on the first day and the first group to try it out at dinner.  We got there around 505PM but they will not serve the lobster ramen dish until 5:30PM so we waited in line.  Pro 1. Lobster broth delicious 5/5 2. Lobster Mean - Cooked okay 4/5  Con: 1. Raman noodle -  Should have used lighter noodle. the texture of the noodle felt more like soba noodles vs ramen style. 2/5 2. My Dinner mate had a bone in her soup and the manager gave a  lame excuse.  -1 3. They should replace the bell pepper with daikon. 4. Chashu pork over cooked 1/5  Overall 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Since returning from our lengthy trip to Japan earlier this year, hubby and I have not really had much inclination to eat ramen in Toronto because it is just not the same after having it there. When I heard that Konjiki was finally open in North York, this ignited a spark of excitement that perhaps this ramen would satisfy my cravings. Since hubby was busy, I arranged to meet a fellow foodie friend for dinner. Thankfully when she arrived around 4:30pm on a weekday, there wasn't a line up to be seated. The restaurant itself is not very big and probably would be best for smaller groups (especially during peak dining hours). I appreciated the minimalist aesthetic and clean washrooms (although sad to report, no Japanese style toilets here).  The menu consists of six different types of ramen, including tonkatsu, shio, shoyu, and vegetarian options. The signature shoyu broth ($14) consists of a clam, chicken and pork broth with house made ramen noodles, tender sous vide pork slices, bamboo shoots seasoned with porcini flake oil, and onion garnishes . While I couldn't quite detect the truffle oil, I did enjoy the perfectly balanced broth that had the right amount of salt (without being overly salty), sweetness and brininess from the clams, and umami from the chicken and pork while overall maintaining a clean finish on the palate. The thinly sliced sous vide pork was tender, not overly fatty, and flavourful. The noodles were clearly made fresh, perfectly al dente and chewy as I prefer my noodles not to be soggy by the time I get to the bottom of my bowl of soup bowl.  While the signature shoyu ramen bowl lacks the usual soft boiled egg, additional toppings such as this and chashu or braised pork belly can be added for $1.50-$3.00 more per topping. We also ordered gyoza ($5 for 5pieces) which was nicely pan fried and had a pronounced garlicky/onion and pork flavour. Note that you are charged $1 per person for green tea.  Yes, I agree that $14 is fairly steep for a bowl of ramen that has fewer toppings than many of your typical ramen places in Toronto. But if you consider that you're paying for a beautifully balanced broth and perfectly al dente fresh noodles prepared at a ramen restaurant that has received Michelin endorsement for several years straight, then $14 seems like a very reasonable price to pay for a delicious satisfying meal that I look forward to trying again!"}
{"text":"Konjiki Ramen! I'd heard about this Michelin starred place coming from Japan all over social media platforms and came up with a plan to visit on my week off with the bf. After our mid day workout at Goodlife, we came here for a post workout meal of carbs and flavour! Greeted quickly around 3PM and seated within 5 mins of waiting - I stared at the bakery window trying not to look at the desserts (be good Cindy, be good)   The signature clam broth was raved about in media. This was what I got and it was definitely a flavour punch. The broth was not overly salty and the server had offered to bring additional broth if I found it too salty for my taste. BF got the Smoky Black ramen which came with smoked pork and a roasted garlic oil/sauce. I enjoyed their shoyu ramen with clam broth and sous vide chashu and bamboo shoots. The noodles were cooked al dente and I can say it is better than any other ramen joints in Toronto. There's something about these noodles bouncing on your palate as you chew~ An egg was ordered for my bowl of noodles ($1.50 extra) along with an order of chicken kaarage ($4.95 for 5 pieces).  Service was good and the wait staff came by to refill water many times.   I'd suggest going here for a late lunch on weekdays if you can or an early dinner as it tends to get busy for the prime lunch and dinner times.   Will be back :)"}
{"text":"After hearing the hype around this place, I decided to give it a visit on Saturday. I got there at around 7:30pm and waited about 20-30 mins for a table for 2. I was able to try both the Shoyu and the Shio signature clam shell broth ramen ($14 each bowl w/o add-ons). Our usual go-to ramen places include Sansotei and Santouka.  The flavour of the broth is very different compared to the ones you get at the above places. You can really taste the depth of the clam flavour and it's not overly salty or creamy. I do have to say the noodles and the sous vide pork were a bit lacklustre. It's probably because I'm used to a fattier pork with a bit more flavour and colour and a choice between thick and thin noodles. I also added two eggs (personal preference) and the flavour was good, however I do like my eggs to be a bit more runny that what I was given. Lastly, the truffle bits really complimented the broth and I preferred the Shoyu over the Shio.  As well, I don't believe this place has a Michelin star but rather a Bib Gourmand distinction which means it offers \"exceptionally good food at moderate prices.\" Definitely worth a try if you're looking for ramen that's bit more unique!"}
{"text":"Have tried the different ramen joints, including (in my order of preference) Raijin, Ryu, Sansotei, Kinton. I'd think for the signature clam broth ramen, I'll put this right between Ryu and Sansotei. The broth flavour is quite unique and not too salty (finally not overly salty) and the noodles are well textured (slightly flat, not fully round).  The price isn't the greatest.. my bowl cost $14 and didn't include an egg - so the extra egg cost $1.50. Serving size was appropriate, much better than those miniature Sansotei bowls where I'd want an extra order of noodles.  For the tonkotsu one that my mother had (the OG one), I didn't quite like the pickled vegetables within the broth so I took the stars off."}
{"text":"Their signature clam shell broth ramen has a really unique flavour you can't get from anywhere else in Toronto! The lineup wasn't too bad, 30 minutes for 3 people at around 6:30, it would be a lot faster for just 2 people.  Regarding the food - the clam broth was super interesting. The shio version tasted like the ocean, it was very freshing. The truffle didn't over power anything of the flavours and it went really well together! What surprised me was how different the shoyu version tasted, the broth was more intense, earthy, and had that bitterness aftertaste similar to Chinese herbal tea.   Not much to say about the appetizers. Gyoza was solid and crispy. Chicken karaage was also solid but pretty similar to what you would expect. The pork belly was a little dry."}
{"text":"One of the famous ramen places has come to Toronto. Apparently it's a Michelin Star ramen restaurant that's very well known in Japan. It was a snowy Monday but when my friend and I arrived at the restaurant and pleasantly surprised it was busy. After my friend got a table, there was at least 20 people waiting in life as it got later in the dinner hour. The restaurant isn't that big with probably only 20 people at its capacity. I ordered their Signature Clam Broth Ramen (Shio). You can also add additional toppings for an extra cost. I love to add an egg to my ramen dish so I added an egg for $1.50. This is apparently their signature ramen dish and many of my friends and fellow foodies order the signature dish. We also ordered the chicken karaage to share. All the food came out within 7 minutes which is super-fast. Shortly after we got the appetizer, both our ramen bowls came out. Pretty quick service and wasn't really expecting that. For $5, you get about 4 large pieces of chicken which wasn't too bad. It came nice and hot with a wasabi mustard that a little kick. As for the ramen, although the noodles were good, there was nothing too special about them. The chasu was good and not too fatty. I always enjoy having an egg in my ramen and this one was a bit more flavorful. I enjoyed the clam broth and thought the taste was quite interesting and unique. It wasn't salty at all and you can really taste the strong presence of the clam in the soup. At $14 per ramen bowl, it is on the higher end in terms of ramen. I found that other ramen places give you more noodles and meat. Konjiki Ramen share the same place as the dessert place called Saryo. They weren't fully operational at the time as they only had cakes and hot beverages so we opted for something else. Overall, I enjoyed the dining experience and wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their other ramen bowls. I can't justify waiting in line for an extended period of time just to eat ramen."}
{"text":"I don't know guys... I did spend fortune for a tonkotsu ramen with a splash of fish oil, served on a broken bar table. Due to the unknown damage, the table was uneven and we were informed that the fix is on the way. But I really don't know now, the blend of shellfish and pork soup was simply 5 billion times better 4 months ago. For those whose NOT willing to spend a green on this ramen, I've got a solution for you.  1. Bring a fish oil with you to any ramen restaurant. 2. Order either shoyu or shio ramen with thick noodle. 3. Add a half spoon full of fish oil and stir well. 4. You've just saved yourself $5 and enjoying konjiki ramen :p 5. Thank me."}
{"text":"I went this place on Dec 16, 2017:  If you want me to recommend a place that the experience is so unworthy / bad so that you won't go again in your life time, this is definitely my top choice and my reasons are as follows:  1. They have tables but they want to put you at waiting. When I am the first one in the queue I found that there are actually 2 tables for 2 and 6 position empty at the bar that are available and they kept me waiting for at least 8 minutes.  2. (mark this!)Their food is very very pricy, and actually not tasty at all, the taste is exactly like those instant noodles sold in j-town.  3. The whole service is not good.     a) We left some fried chicken and we want to pack it home. They claimed that they only have small container but don't have any bag.     b) The 13 dollar's noodle doesn't come with egg so when we want to order an extra egg, they said their eggs are sold out... (wtf... at 5PM? seriously?)  4. The line is long, you need to wait at least half an hour.  Summary: Compare to sansotei and Hakata Shoryuken Ramen, this place is way much worse.   On my list, along with \"Kobe Steel\", this restaurant really shame the name of \"Made in Japan\"."}
{"text":"Really unique experience at Konjiki! I think the ultimate test of how legitimate a place is if they have a language barrier haha (I'm a fan of that!). All the staff here are so sweet and cute.  My friend and I got offered a few different spots to sit at but we were persistant on waiting for a table. The hostess was very nice about that and did not force us to sit at the first open seat. It was also a cold night so everyone would come around with hot water refills to warm up our bellies, which is a really nice touch. It's a small restaurant but the service is lightning speed fast. We ordered the shio ramen, chicken karage, gyoza, pork belly and boiled eggs to our ramen. The karage is super crunchy and is served with a nice wasabi mayo to cut through the fried taste. The pork belly is nice and tender and the gyoza tastes standard. I have to say these eggs are 5/6ths done which might be the way they do it but I prefer a runny yolk. The ramen is unique and not like other broths at the other chains. The clam broth is prominent and when mixed with the onions and truffle paste, you can an indescribable umami taste. It's interesting because I believe ramen broth is usually pork bone or chicken stock.  I would come again if I'm in the area and definitely earlier because they sell out of some products soon!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the weirdest experience i've had at a restaurant.   Staff was extremely unorganized. They were nice, but so unorganized. Three people would come up and as the same question. There clearly wasn't any communications with the staff.  My friend and I have been planning for weeks on when we should go. We went on a Wednesday and it had some lobster special that canceled out all the tonkatsu. Which was so disappointing. It took longer to decide what to order and at one point an employee was really rushing us to pick our meal.   I chose the chashu don, and it had a pretty good amount for $6. As much as id like to come back to try the tonkatsu, the experience we had there just makes me not want to.   This ramen restaurant was over hyped, the ramen were too over the top. Some of the ingredients were too extra. Sadly, not coming back."}
{"text":"I love anything with soup. My boyfriend and I tried both signature truffle ramen. It is impeccable with the clam soup base. There are no reservation and the wait time during the day was not bad, around 15 mins wait. Tofu nugget was a must try!! It's definitely a great side and the texture tasted like real nuggets. I love how the soft serve is connected to the actual restaurant, you can get great dessert after a fabulous meal. Highly recommended! Staff are great!"}
{"text":"I've been having kinton ramen daily for the past few months and, upon hearing about this place when I was in Japan, I tried the original store in shibuya a week ago before I came back to try it here. I got there at 1pm on a Saturday, hoping to avoid the lunch rush. Nope. It was still hyped.   I went alone so I got seated in around 10 minutes at the bar, which was a lot shorter than in Japan. (Everyone else who was in line before me was glaring at me.) I ordered the shio ramen and the karaage. The noodles came fast and it smelled so damn good. I drank the soup first and it was just as delicious as the one in shibuya. I could see the little squirt of truffle on the chashu so I mixed it in the soup and drank it. Even better.   The noodles were tender and the portion was generous. The meat was super tender and there's three pieces (compared to two at kinton). The karaage was small and not worth it. But it was all about the SOUP. It was the best ramen soup I've ever had, clam based and warm. It filled me up completely. I drank the entire bowl.   Holy crap, I'm definitely going back for the broth. I can justify waiting for 15 mins for THAT soup. Can't wait for the hype to die down and have another bowl."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we get there 15 mins before opening and i am so glad we did. Closer to 11:30 a line started to form and we were second in line. The waiters were kind enough to serve hot matcha for us while we waited. The matcha was a bit too sweet for my liking, but the subtle grassy note is still there.  I got the signature shoyu with an added egg and a side of karaage to split with my friend. The karaage is tender and juicy and the wasabi mayo helped to cut the heaviness of it instead of lemon juice which is what is normally served with karaage to lighten it up. My favorite part of the meal is definitely the broth. I love that they used clams to build complexity in the soup. It adds this clean sweetness to the soup. I know the soup is not light because of the layer of oil floating above the broth, but it tasted clean to me (says the person that can eat 20 pc mcnuggets as a meal). The sweetened bamboo shoots brings out the sweetness of this delicious broth. The soup is not creamy so if that is your requirement in your ramen you are better off choosing the tonkotsu broth.  The egg is perfectly cooked. When i poked it with my chopsticks, you can see runny golden yellow yolk flooding my spoon and it is delicious. I don't like paying $1.50 for a boiled egg, but I will make an exception for konjiki. All in all, i think this is my favorite ramen place in Toronto. The portions are smaller than most ramen shops in the GTA, but the sophistication of the flavors makes Kinjiki worth visiting and revisiting."}
{"text":"Finally got to see what the hype was all about this michelin recommend ramen place.  Was here on week night around 7pm prepare for a good wait.

{"text":"The Michelin Recommended Ramen Shop is finally here in Toronto!! Came here last Wednesday in the freezing cold but felt it was totally worth it.  Arrived around 540 so only needed to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  My friend and I both went with the Shoyu Signature Ramen (~$14) with an egg added.  Their Signature Ramen are all clam base, so if you are allergic to seafood, you probably want to try other ramen.  Portion was decent, although only three pieces of Chasu (very normal for ramen shops), they were at least delicious and not dry.  Ramen wise, they don't use the typical yellow noodles you have at ramen places, instead their noodle is more soba like and I though it went quite well with the flavour and the texture was great too.  Soup base was also not too salty, so the overall ramen was perfect for me!  We also ordered a Chicken Karaage and the Karaage was pretty big.  $5 for 4 chicken Karaage is a little more expensive than I expected, but at least the chicken was juicy and it wasn't over fried.  I will for sure be returning to try other ramen and appetizers!  O and yes I need to leave some room for desserts next time too!!  4 stars for now.  Seating wasn't the greatest, a little pricier than their competitors and it's cash only as of now."}
{"text":"AMAIZNG! Been wanting to come here for a while, worth the 30min subway up here. I had the intense clam & loved the original Flavor, my husband had the spicy red which was a super flavorful creamy Raman. WE WILL BE BACK"}
{"text":"Service 0/5 - arrived at 4:00 pm and was seated right away. informed the server what i wanted right away. Server forgot to punch in the order and didn't bother to check on why i didn't get my ramen. Several people who arrived after me received their food before me. I let her know and then finally they placed an order. Same server never filled my water even when she filled the water of the patron beside me. I informed her that I wasn't happy with the service and she didn't do anything. Tried to pay and had to wait another 20 minutes as she didn't know how to use the credit card machine. I really hope they hope they retrain \"Yuna\".  I wish this was about the food only, but the service was too terrible to ignore  Food 4/5 - If you disregard the service, the food here is great. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the right amount of chew. the broth itself was perfectly salty with a subtle clam broth flavor. Mix in the truffle sauce and it blends well with the broth. I personally would like a bit less salt but that's based on my own flavour profile.   If the service improves, I will be back."}
{"text":"It's important to mention that this location is not a Michelin-rated restaurant - the location in Tokyo is the one that is recognized. With that being said, the standards have certainly brought its way to the Toronto location. If you love seafood flavour, then you will certainly love this ramen. Although its ~$2 more expensive than your regular ramen, I feel that the quality is worth that extra costs. The truffle oil really brings out the flavours and adds an extra richness that I haven't tasted in other ramens.   I think that its worth trying this place at least once - to experience the Michelin-endorsed restaurant and the unique clam broth."}
{"text":"Irasshaimase!  We were excited to try the ramen restaurant that for the past few weeks on everyone's lips and arrived on a Saturday afternoon for lunch to this bustling ramen shop. Connected to the restaurant was the dessert cafe \"Saryo\", also a popular chain imported from Japan. Although, as my fellow reviewers have noted, the lines to get in were long, the service once inside was rapid and friendly, characteristic of these traditional ramen bars and izakayas that have popped up throughout the GTA.   We tried the Shoyu clam broth ramen (+ egg + extra pork belly), and the spicy tonkotsu ramen. Though it was the clam broth ramen that won Mr. Atsushi Yamamoto (founder) the Michelin Gourmand Bib four years in a row (an award for serving Michelin quality food at reasonable prices), it was the spicy tonkotsu ramen that amazed us.   The shoyu ramen was light and refreshing, the noodles were chewy and we could really taste the clams in the broth. Yet, it did not feel like a violation of authentic Shoyu ramen, a risk that using clam broth instead of chicken or beef broth might entail. The egg was perfectly soft-boiled and very flavourful. The sous-vide chashu was tender but lacked the flavour that the rich pork belly had. Both meats were less salty and less oily in comparison to other ramen bowls I've had.   My favourite ramen is generally the tonkotsu ramen as I love the creamy, rich broth signature to the dish. The spiciness of the dish was mild, but we could taste the fresh spicy peppers thinly sliced in the dish. The broth was definitely the highlight of this dish as it achieved a unique umami flavour that I had not encountered in other tonkotsu ramen dishes before. You'll need to try it; it is indescribably good. I would recommend adding extra meat and the egg to this as well to supplement a somewhat sparse array of toppings in both dishes. The house-made pork-belly side dish (7$) that comes with egg would be a good way to achieve this for two people.     Most patrons did not get dessert that afternoon but that would be a mistake. Saryo is a dessert chain specializing in matcha and hojicha ice-cream and lattes. We tried the Hojicha Saryo signature parfait (Hojicha can be thought of as a roasted green tea, hence the brown colour, and it is a must try if you like matcha). If you have tried Tsujiri, then this place will feel familiar as both offer multi-ingredient green tea ice cream parfaits, filled with delicious tasting Japanese sweets such as mochi and red bean. The unique flavours in this parfait such as green tea and water jelly, cubes of matcha brownies really made it stand out as a delicious dessert.   One of the great things about ramen is that its variations are so different that everyone can find a flavour that appeals to them. We loved the tonkotsu ramen but the appeal of the clam broth shoyu was clear as well. Compared to the other ramen places in town, this is definitely in my Top 2 for its unique yet traditional, bold yet authentic flavours."}
{"text":"Koniki ramen definitely underwhelmed. After reading so many rave reviews regarding the ramen place it did not live up to my expectation. My girlfriend and myself ordered the shoyu ramen and the black tonkatsu, and the gyoza.  Mistakenly, i did not realize but the black tonkatsu does  not come with chasu but ground pork. In addition the egg i ordered with my shoyu ramen was cold! Overall id rate the shoyu ramen a 7/10 and the  black tonkatsu a 6/10. The gyoza was not to my liking as it had a ton of ginger pieces.  In comparison to other ramen places, the shoyu ramen can hold its own to other major chains. Where as the black tonkatsu, you can find MUCH better at Sansotei.   Overall an okay experience, hopefully the flavours improve once the issues have been ironed out."}
{"text":"First of all, don't be fooled, the owner is Chinese, not Japanese  Ramen's portion was small compared to places like Sensotei  Clam broth tastes great  With egg, a ramen costs over $16 after tax. Absolutely overpriced and not worth it.  Oh and the owner claims that his credit card machine isn't ready (it has been 7 weeks since they opened) and that he only takes cash  I will be reporting this store to the CRA for potential tax evasion."}
{"text":"Even on a snowy day, there were loads of people queueing! We came here for Friday lunch, turned up around 13:00 and were seated around 14:15 (two of us).   I have never tasted a ramen broth like this before. Get the shoryu ramen -- soy sauce base with clam broth. The soy sauce and clam flavor must have some multiplier effect of umami! So fresh and tasty, with a lightness like clam miso soup, without being overly salty. The portion size is on the smaller side for North American standards, but it's actually much closer to what portions are like in ramen shops in Japan. Like other reviewers mentioned you have to order egg separately for $1.50 extra. They give you an generous portion of noodles which were cooked to the right chewiness.  We also ordered the chicken karaage but I would skip it next time. It wasn't super flavorful or moist, and it comes with a wasabi mayo which some people may like but it's not my preference.  Giving it 4 stars only because I feel that having an egg in your ramen is a basic human right, but otherwise great service and quality!"}
{"text":"As a \"soft opening,\" I think they have some things to work on before the official grand opening.  The signature shoyu ramen was flavourful and you could taste the clams in the broth.  The ramen seemed freshly made, but the downside is, I don't recall having to order an egg as a side before, so this was unusual for me.  I also ordered extra pork belly, which my friend said was pretty good.  While my friend ordered a signature shio ramen, we ordered karaage to share. The portion was small, sadly.  There wasn't anything too special about the fried chicken.  In general, it seemed like the food wasn't piping hot and actually cooled down very quickly.  The servers were really polite.  At first, we were first seated at the counter table. As other yelpers have commented, there aren't any hooks or anything to put your coats/bags, so it was quite inconvenient to sit with coats and bags on our laps.  Thankfully, we were allowed to relocate to an actual table for two, so it was more comfortable to sit on chairs with back panels.  Overall, it's a hype to try a Tokyo Michelin restaurant, but I'm not sure if I would come back for a ramen craving.  Worth a try though."}
{"text":"i had very high expectations for the ramen, especially after the media reviews. i will saw the pictures made a difference and looked very intriguing - and of course they got to interact with chef Atsushi himself. i completely understand this week is just a soft opening, so keep that in mind if you're reading my review. my friends got here just before open and they were able to get a table for the first round of seating. the rest of the line was up to the door, probably up to 15 people.   we started off with an order of the karaage. it came with 4 pieces so one for each of it, but definitely overpriced for such a small portion. it was good, accompanied with a spicy mustard.   now to the ramen. i ordered the original spicy tonkotsu, which came with minced pork, egg was extra for $1.50. when i tried my soup, it was warm not hot, warm. i kindly sent it back and they were very nice about it. when it came back it was much hotter, not scorching hot but hot. however, they forgot the egg this time so they brought it on the side.  the ramen itself .. well the noodles didn't have a bite, i definitely thought it was a bit too soft, i like some texture. the minced pork was marinated with beans .. and taco spice. the cumin was an overkill in my opinion and made it hard to enjoy the ramen. i didn't appreciate my ramen tasting like a taco bowl, but that's just me, some may like it :) the unami was there but again, the flavour of the meat too much.   my friends tried their original clam shoyu broth, they too were not impressed. the slices of pork were very very thin. they also forgot one of their eggs.  we paid $20 each - considering the price and the quality, i'm not inclined to return. but i understand this is their soft opening, i'm sure they'll improve over the weeks."}
{"text":"Went to an invitation only tasting event. Had the signature ramen. Fairly basic looking at face value but extra tasty. Definitely has an exquisite taste which makes your taste buds wanting more. We were provide with the basic menu for sampling but they plan on including kobe and lobster. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"It was good, we werent blown away and have had much better ramen in the city. The wait wasn't too long on a Sunday night and service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Ramen was very good! I've been here few times, tried their Light clam broth, Intense shoyu clam broth and Black Garlic. My favourite is the intense shoyu, you can taste the clam broth but it's not too rich.  Waiting time is about 15-20 mins so be prepared to line up, but once you have a seat, food prep is very quick."}
{"text":"We went around 5:30pm-ish on a Sunday evening.  The line up was quite long. One staff member with a clipboard will come around, and ask if you got a number or not. If they didn't get you in the first round, wait a bit. They'll be back for you!  I noticed the island seats have hooks under the table, to hang jackets or bags.  We sat down around 6:15pm. The place was packed! I had ordered the Special Tonkotsu Ramen (Shoyu) and it was delicious!!! The soup base was creamy and I liked it. The soup was a little salty but hey I still enjoyed it!  The service was good, the staff went around with water refills!"}
{"text":"Basing it on the long line up and Michelin star rating we came in with high expectations. Waited for about 20 mins before getting a table for 4 people. I think if they made the dessert counter in the front smaller, they can fit more tables in the area.  Here's what we ordered: Mild shio signature clam broth Ramen: you can definitely taste the clam flavour. The broth was light and was drinkable. Ramen was chewy, however the chashu was dry and wasn't fatty enough. The ramen also didn't come with a soft boiled egg like most places which include at least half an egg.   chicken karaage: came out cold for some reason. It's suppose to come out hot and crispy so I was very disappointed in this side dish.  smoky black tonkotsu ramen: nice smoky taste to the broth. However again the meat was disappointing. The grounded meat does not go well with ramen. It's better to charge more and replace it with pork belly with this dish.  Strawberry cheesecake: not much flavour to it. cheese cake taste more like a tasteless whip cream. the slice was very small for the price.  Hojicha ice cream with mocha and red bean: ice cream was a bit watery for my liking. The mochi was nice and chewy. Again for the price, the portion was a lot smaller than expected.   Overall, we were a bit disappointed with it. We would go again to try their other menu items like their pork belly, but this wouldn't be a ramen place i would want to go to when craving for ramen."}
{"text":"I decided to visit this new chain at Yonge/Finch area since I have heard so much about it. There was a lineup that reached the door but it wasn't too long of a wait.   Service: the service was adequate. Servers will come when you wave them now. They didn't check up on our table to refill our water unless we wave them down.   Food: my friend ordered the clam broth and I ordered the Smokey black tonkotsu ramen. I had high expectations for the signature clam broth but I wasn't too impressed. The broth didn't stand out to me much to have a strong seafood/clam flavor. It was your average ramen broth. The Smokey black was nice and rich in flavor. Overall, the ramen was okay. We also ordered a side of karaage. Again, it is your typical karaage.  I wanted to try Konjiki since I enjoy trying different ramen chains. But I can't say I love it so much and I will return.   ."}
{"text":"The lineup for their soft opening on Friday lunch was expected but manageable. We waited 30-40 mins to get a table for 2. Our first impression was why they wasted half the restaurant space for the cafe + dessert place that resembled Tsujiri that was just down the street....  I don't typically enjoy ramen because their broth is always too strong and overpowering in flavour. However Konjiki's broth was very balanced and flavourful, sometimes even subtle. I thorough enjoyed the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen because even though it said it was spicy, it was enjoyable and overpowering (until you can't taste anything). The broth was silky and creamy.  Even though I don't expect to pay $13-14 for a just bowl of ramen and broth (egg, cha siu, pork belly, etc for extra $), this has been my favourite bowl of ramen by far."}
{"text":"I see how this is a chain from a \"Michelin-recommended\" restaurant and not a \"Michelin star\" restaurant.  I tried the signature shoyu clam based broth ramen. The broth and the noodles were excellent! The clam based broth brings out a sweetness, and matches quite well with the truffle flavour. At least they did not overpower each other. I prefer the noodles after it has been soaked in the broth for a few minutes. They did not become soggy. I finished the broth to the last drop without feeling gross. Although towards the very end, it was just a tad salty.   While in my opinion, the broth and the noodles are the most important part to the ramen, one must not neglect the toppings! The chasu/meat that came with the ramen was truly underwhelming. The meat was too lean even for my liking. And it had no flavour at all. I felt like little effort was put into creating the meat. I also opted out of the soft boiled egg because of the reviews I read.   My piece of advice to Chef Yamamoto is to perfect on every detail of the experience, including the toppings. This will make it a Michelin experience.  Really on the border on this one between a 3-4 star. I think I will return so I'll give it a 4."}
{"text":"The hype train for konjiki is alive and well. To avoid a lineup I went at around 4:30.  It was a super cold day so a bowl of piping hot ramen is the perfect elixir. I was really looking forward to try the ramen since Michelin recommended restaurants don't exactly grow on trees in toronto. I consider myself more of a traditionalist when it comes to ramen preferences so rating an overhyped new ramen restaurant that sells on its fusion elements is an interesting challenge. However I did enjoy ryu which is somewhat similar to konjikis style. Conversely I throughly enjoyed the old school nature of isshins traditional approach. My ultimate verdict is that the shoyu clam broth ramen is a solid bowl of ramen. Not the best ive but I did enjoy it. If not for the Michelin recommendation I'd probably give it half a star more. Noodle was al dente. The dominant taste of the soup was pork bone even though it was not overpowering nor over salty. However the soup while solid is also a letdown. As the menu claims to use clam broth, I had a hard time tasting the hints of saltiness, sweetness and ocean that clams generally possess.  If the clam broth is the selling point but you can't taste it, isn't that a bit of a waste of ingredients? Also for a restaurant or the chef to be considered Michelin rated shouldn't there be a meticulous concern for minor details? One instance of such oversight  is the bamboo shoots used, there are some pieces where it is a bit on the hard side. The chashu is not the round fatty variety that I would of preferred but was decent. The chashu was a nice cut of meat where you can taste the pork taste. While the texture is not hard but its also not close to the melt in your mouth variety. Knowing that they used sous vide to cook the meat, it is not an unreasonable expectation. Little things... but that's what should separate the real Michelin star rated restaurants from the pretenders."}
{"text":"I am kind of picky when it comes to ramen as I don't particularly enjoy eating it. I've always found the broth generally too salty (it's supposed to be that way but I just don't like it.) I came with two friends to try it on a Friday night a few months back and while there was a line, it was not out the door nor did they run out of ramen. (They ran out of ramen one night at around 8pm). I had the Mild Shio Signature Clam Broth ramen while my other two friends had the Shoyu Clam Broth. I thought it was okay. I think it was too overhyped. I had expected more - sth that stood out. I tried not to mix it all together to begin with because I wanted to try the soup base on its own. The broth was very mild in flavour. I did taste a tinge of sweetness but am not entirely sure if it is because of the clams. The porcini mushroom paste - when mixed in with the soup, brought it to another level but I thought it overpowered  such a delicate soup base. The one thing that stood out was the chashu, it was very moist and soft. All in all, it was not terrible but not that special."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend at around 5PM today and it took us approximately 40 minutes to get seated. We were seated at the island booth, which was kind of uncomfortable considering we didn't have any place to hang our coats, but the lighting was great at least...!   I got the shio ramen while my friend got the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. If you're a fan of the traditional, savory and salty cream broth I'd go with the tonkotsu. If you're feeling adventurous and want to try a new taste to ramen (in this particular case, a clam flavor) then you should definitely try the shio. I thought the portions were great, the noodles were firm and chewy and the toppings complimented the dish. I'm a bit confused about all of the low ratings!   We also ordered the chicken karaage, however we were told it wasn't made because the order didn't go through. When we checked up on it, they told us right away that they were making it and we got it five minutes later. The chicken was very flavorful and tender!  Overall service was great and the servers were very friendly. I would definitely come back here again!  Some tips i would like to give: - THEY ACCEPT DEBIT AND CREDIT CARDS! Ignore all the other tips that say otherwise. They recently got a machine three days ago, which also accepts Apple Pay - The Mayo in the chicken Karaage has wasabi in it! Don't order it if you're not a fan of it"}
{"text":"Michelin Ranked Ramen: the buzz and the marketing added to the long lineup that piled into the store. All said and done, would recommend as the food is well made, the broth has many layers to it and is very fragrant and each bowl has its own staple taste. The clam based bowl that's unique to Konjiki is quite Savory A-grade fresh, as is the pork bone broth that's fragrant, heavy but not overpowering one dimensional. It's pan fried dumplings (gyoza) is mediocre at best and the filling is a bit dry in my opinion but the gold of this store is in the broths. The topping plating is well presented. Food wise would definitely recommend. That said, the pricing is on the higher end of ramen, directly comparable to Santouka which is also a global ramen franchise and Toronto boasts one near Eaton Centre. As opposed to Sansotei or Kinton that also use high quality ingredients and well received throughout the city, but more of a value dish at $14 all ingredients in. The bowl itself here with bare toppings start at $14 with $1.5 to $3 for each additional topping. It's quite reasonable in my opinion but does make out to $20 a bowl which is on the pricey side of ramen. The service was very slow and they're clearly understaffed. Be sure to follow up on your line up because we were forgotten ... twice... on the waiting list. It came out to be a 1.5 hour wait. Quite certain that's not the Michelin Star service we were expecting but I'm sure with time and experience this place will pull through. Location is easily situated two min from a subway stop so convenient to get to. Overall would recommend when the line dies down as the food is well done."}
{"text":"Happy to have tried Japan's bib gourmand ramen! I'll admit I'm not a ramen connoisseur, but the broth was flavourful without being overly salty and the noodles were nice and chewy.   The line wasn't too bad when I went, and I would go back if I'm craving ramen again!"}
{"text":"not friendly for a group of 5 and up too long to wait for the table for big group?almost 1 hour tonight? due to poor service .  if you are 2 people or less ?will be fast"}
{"text":"The shio signature clam ramen was delicious!!! You can seriously taste the umami in this. First time I ever finished the whole bowl of ramen including the soup. There is a lot of technique and care put into this bowl or ramen. Pork was thinly sliced and sous vide. The hint of white truffle made it earthy and inviting. Pancetta crumbs were small but flavourful. Even after the 3rd day I am still craving it    My friend ordered the braised pork belly, which is too fatty in my opinion (personal preference). Gyoza was good but comparable to other places. Service was very friendly and efficient. They are also attached to a Japanese matcha dessert place (even though I prefer Tsujiri down the street). One stop shop!"}
{"text":"I was excited that they boasted about their veg option with such confidence as not being an alternative to the meat options but more of a great stand alone option. The broth was a soy based broth that reminded me of cream of wheat. It was so weird. After a few bites I found it just gross. The noodles were also strange, porous and grainy. Overall I didn't like the meal. The green tea was however of great quality and quite delicious. Not going back here again."}
{"text":"Had to wait in line around 12pm on Sat for around 20mins. Not terrible. Food came quick and menu was quite simple to understand. The noodles were very chewy and firm. The soup was definitely flavourful and intense for both the mild truffle and intense shoyu. Don't be fooled by the small bowl, once the food sits you'll feel quite full.   Losing one star because the ingredients were so simple and felt a bit lacking.  Definitely going to come back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"This ramen is definitely something different from other ramen in the city. I had the Signature Clam Broth (shio) which comes with bamboo shoots, sous vide pork and topped with chopped red onions & green onions. Added egg - nicely marinated, soft boiled (runny). The noodles are so good, kind of like slippery Chinese noodles, very different from the typical ramen. The broth has a fragrant onion aroma, on the oily side but not as heavy as the usual pork shio broth. Couldn't taste the clam (it's actually a mix of clam, pork and chicken broth), but the truffle flavor was there and I love truffle.   We also had a side of Tofu Nuggets - it was ok, didn't really like the texture (sort of like fish tofu).   *Cash Only*"}
{"text":"This place has been in the media for quite a while and I was happy to try it out during their soft opening! It's already quite busy during rush hours and it's better to go during off time if you don't want to wait.   I tried their clam broth ramen and it was quite good! The portion is small for $14 and I could have another appetizer to make it a full meal. The broth is really delicious and I finished it all! I read online that the special point is that the soup is savory and tasty but not overly salty.   I'll go back and try out their other flavors for sure!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Overhyped and overrated. I would rank this place below most ramen restaurants in Toronto; definitely below average and not worth the price. Came here for dinner on weekday, huge lineup as expected. We ordered their signature shio and shoyu. Egg doesn't come standard with the ramen and is an extra $1.50. We waited for a very long time, in line and even at our table. We saw others who came after us get their food before us, finished, and left and we still haven't gotten our order. When I spoke to the manager she just played it off with a lol-woops-we-missed-it-ma-bad attitude. But that's okay, s&;t happens, right? We were not impressed with the food at all. The extra pork belly we ordered was thin and sloppily prepped. I was most looking forward to the soup. Sadly, however, the broth was probably the most disappointing part of our experience. It was over seasoned with some weird spice that overpowered the entire bowl. Portion was small, the two tiny pieces of bamboo shoots might as well have not been included. Overall, very disappointed and will not be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with 3 other people ,and it was packed! Luckily, after 15 minutes we were seated on the middle.  Service was nice. We were greeted as we entered and were told to wait ,which was cool, it was pretty full.After we were seated they came to take our order as soon as we set our menus down and food came to us quick enough.  I got the spicy red tonkotsu ramen which was $13 (not bad) and it was great! The broth was rich in flavour, spicy and hot! However, I wish the broth was spicier but that's just preference , since I like to test my limits. Unfortunately, the soft boiled egg (tamago) comes as an extra but it's  worth it when you get it! Also their side dishes are satisfactory. The gyoza was my favourite and the karage , pork belly don and  braised pork belly were a-okay.  The place is nice yet the seating area was smaller than expected since there's a dessert place inside called \"Saryo Cafe\". The mini cafe mainly served matcha related desserts and I am a suckeeer for matcha desserts aha.   Overall, great place to come to after a long day hanging out with friends. Would come back for the ramen AND the dessert. Have fun to anyone who comes to Konjiki and savour the broth :)"}
{"text":"This was the first stop on a food crawl along Yonge Street, on either side of Finch Avenue. This area is packed with lots of tiny little restaurants, mostly Asian.  A Michelin rated ramen shop (Tokyo location)? Hmmm, it must be good. We'll have to wait and see. And I mean WAIT. It took close to an hour to get in and get seated. People were lined up on the sidewalk before the place opened. It must be really good!  My dining companion, and food crawl planner, Jennifer K., ordered the Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen with chashu (pork) and I had the Smoky Black Tonkatsu Ramen, also with pork. We shared an order of Chicken Karage.  Wow! This pork broth is so rich and full of flavour! All the ingredients worked really well together and the noodles were the right texture. Jennifer K. was also ejoying her ramen. She was busy eating, not talking.  The chicken karage was crispy but very tender on the inside. I could have eaten more of this.  After the long wait to get in, we finished our meal in about 20 minutes. Yes, it was worth the wait! Delicious food, good service. People were still waiting out the door when we left."}
{"text":"Came here on soft opening and there was a long queue.  Came again a week later and waited for 15 minutes.  I had their signature clam broth ramen and my friend had smoky black tonkotsu ramen.  The broth is clear, has a mild briny flavor and with a strong aroma.  The noodle is chewy, and the chashu is perfectly cooked.  Fantastic service; friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Michelin ramen open in Toronto!  When the ramen bowl arrived, you can smell the clam broth!  The soup does taste better than Sansotei, more flavoured.  The pork is not so tender, however the egg is very good.  The egg costs extra 1.5 for one, but I recommend.  We also order the chicken karage, the dipping sauce is very good and special.  It is mayo with wasabi!  Overall this is the best ramen location in town."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, after having a wonderful experience with the Tonkotsu Ramen last time. I decided to try the lobster ramen that's only available on Wednesday, since it's such a rare (and gourmet) item. Like the Tonkotsu soup base, it was very smooth and flavourful. The large chunks of lobster meat were also tender and plentiful. I'm not sure I'll order it again because $30 for a bowl of ramen seems too extravagant, but I'm very glad I've had it at least once.  Note: their noodles do not come with egg, and it's worth it to add it to your order since they cook it to perfection, though on both visits, I could hear other people \"complain\" about this."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this place after seeing all the great reviews and it surpassed it! We went for lunch on a Saturday and the wait was about 20 minutes. Service was very fast, the order came out promptly in less than 5 minutes. We ordered the Shoyu Clam Broth and Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen and added a Tamago to both bowls. We also shared the Chicken Karaage. Everything was so good! I really enjoyed the Shoyu because of delicious clam broth and strong truffle flavours. Noodles had a great texture and the pork was cooked well. The Tonkotsu was good but had only some ground pork. The soft boiled egg was ok and the Karaage was crispy and juicy. The ramen is a bit pricier so it is is not our new go to ramen place but nice once and awhile. Also, only street parking."}
{"text":"Very average ramen, light on toppings, monotonous in flavour. Even with additional toppings, the bowls felt far too noodle-focused, leaving much to be desired. Pork was average, neither here nor there, with forgettable side dishes. Priced high for ramen. Was expecting more from a Michelin-starred T?ky? restaurant; hopefully they can refine and make it more closely align it with the original shop."}
{"text":"Stopped by 1:30 busy but had room for quick lunch for one. First time here, I was going to order their Shoyu ramen but ended up with Lobster special. Broth was flavourful Lobster tail was decent portion but of course not fresh but decent quality. Just the broth and noodles was good on its own so I shall return for regular ramen next time"}
{"text":"They are superrrrrr busy right now and rightfully so because the ramen is amazinggggg.  Okay so first, since they are super busy there is a little bit of a wait but you are always greeted with smiles and a willingness to keep things moving which I can appreciate!   Secondly, their food is worth the wait and prices, which are priced competitively. We started with the tofu nuggets and gyoza. Gyoza were made in house and pretty good. The lobster ramen that they have on Wednesday's is the thing to get. Be warned however they remove the part of the menu with tonkatsu ramens in order to focus on the lobster ramen. The lobster ramen comes with a whole lobster tail and claw. For 28 dollars you will really enjoy it I promise you! The end leaves you with a really warm feeling in the tummy.   Service was really good as well! They always are ready to fill your cups and are not pushy at all. If you sit at the island, there are hooks under the table for your jacket and purse.   Will I be back???? Ummmmmm yeahhhh"}
{"text":"Not exactly living up to the hype for me considering that it's a Michelin star ramen restaurant from Japan, and the founder/head chef is cooking in the kitchen during its soft opening period.  Environment: Pretty much steps from the North York Centre subway station, so the restaurant is pretty easily accessible by commuters.  Walking in the restaurant, they have a dessert section near the entrance, which is a collaboration with another restaurant that sells many Japanese matcha desserts. The ramen restaurant itself is ok size with some single tables on the sides, and a big communal bar table in the middle with uncomfortable bar stools. It is recommended that you come in a group of 4 of fewer to minimize the wait time, and I think the largest group size they can accommodate right now is 6.  Food: The ramens average $13-14 for the soft opening menu, desserts about $5-7, and sides about $5. I got the Shio Ramen ($14) with Chicken Karaage ($5) on the side.  The Chicken Karaage came first and my goodness the portion was tiny, that it was 4 pieces of chicken about the same size as chicken nuggets. Taste wise it was so average as well, nothing stood out, which totally didn't justify the high price.  The Shio Ramen broth had an interesting flavour: the soup was pretty light but had a sweet taste with a hint of bitterness due to the clamp. Not exactly my cup of tea considering that I prefer my soup creamy. Other than that the ramen was very lackluster and the portion was small. It only contained noodles, 3 slices of Chashu, and a few pieces of bamboo shoot. So basically what I was paying for was the brand name, because certainly, the ingredients didn't cost very much.   Service: Since the restaurant opened not too long ago, many people were eager to try it, so the line was pretty long even though I came on a Wednesday night. We waited for about 30 mins for a table for 4, but the waiter was quite nice at updating us the status of the tables and offered to split our group up if we wanted to be seated faster. During the actual dining experience, the waiter would periodically come to refill our water.  Since this was their soft opening period they didn't have any machines set up so it was cash only. They just so happened to mess up my change and gave me $4 short, which I definitely wasn't too thrilled about  Overall, I guess the ramen was alright, but it was too plain and too light for my taste, and I quite lacked the toppings. Personally, I would much prefer going to Sansotei and Santouka, which have more food at or below the price, so I don't see myself coming again."}
{"text":"I was glad that there was no wait the day I went as the noodles were average tasting. For the price of the ramen, it wasn't worth it ($14 and it's additional cost to add an egg). The portion size was on the smaller side and the shoyu ramen that I ordered was pretty salty."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that people who come here with the expectation that this is a MICHELIN star restaurant are setting the bar too high - there are no Michelin Star restaurants in Canada so get off your high horse and enjoy a nice bowl of ramen for goodness sake!   I came here based on a recommendation by a friend - had no prior knowledge that it is \"Michelin endorsed\" and I was pleasantly surprised. We tried the smoky black tonkatsu as well as the spicy red tonkatsu, and the karrage to start.   PROS: This is the CREAMIEST ramen I've had in the GTA - I seriously question if they use any diary because the broth was THAT RICH. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The service was so speedy.   The karrage were average - lightly fried and seasoned (they are not bite size as I am use to - they serve them cut into big chunks)    CONS: The spicy red tonkatsu is not really that spicy. The pork belly and soft boiled egg are additionals and run your bill up to almost $20/bowl with tax"}
{"text":"Waited about 30min and went in with high expectation from all they hype but came out full of disappointment.  All the ramen were priced around $13-14 which is quite expensive.  It didn't come with an egg or chasiu for the tonkatsu.  All I got for $13 was a bowl of noodles.  The ramen wasn't good at all.  Noodles were overcooked and has no chew to it.  I had better bowl of ramen elsewhere and at a lower price point."}
{"text":"My feelings are a bit mixed on this review as I do want to like this place. While there was a lot of hype for this place , I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. I sat on the fence for writing a review, as they are still in their \"soft opening\" phase, so things will be hit and miss.  When I went, we ordered the signature clam ramen, smoked ramen, karaage and tofu nuggets.  We were never asked if we would like to drink anything, and we had to chase someone down to get water at the end of our meal. Yup, no one came by to get us water. We were not dying of thirst, but only got thirsty after eating. Would have been nice to have water already on hand.  Honestly the sides were very underwhelming. The tofu nuggets are nothing special, except for being a bit pricer then other places. The karaage had a tad too much burnt bits, and it was more \"batter with chicken\" then \"chicken with batter\". I honestly can't recommend the sides at all.  The clam broth was very aromatic, and tasty. The meat that comes with it is made \"sous vide\" style (that's the fancy way where they cook the meat in boiling water in a bag). It was definitely different from the usual charred bbq version most places serve.  I'm sitting on the fence with whether I liked the smoke ramen. When you first taste it, it's a very nice taste. But towards the end of the meal, you start to realize it's pretty much liquid smoke flavoring that was added in to give it that smoky flavor. What I'm trying to say is that the smoke flavor tasted very artificial.   Though the actual ramen noodles were probably the best I have had in Toronto. Thin, yet they were still very nice and firm, with a nice bounce to the bite (al dante).   Again since it's only a soft opening, I expect that there will be a lot of bugs, and I would be happy to update this review once I have the chance to come back a few times.  But for what I experienced, there is definitely room for improvement to go from good to great, but I was not wowed."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon (3pm), we waited for 20 -25mins before we get seated which was not bad at all considering how hyped up this restaurant is in the city.   We ordered their signature Clam broth ramen in shio and shoyu.  I like Shio a lot more than the Shoyu broth mainly because I could actually taste the clam flavour in the soup.  It is mild and not oily.  Shoyu broth is more on the salty side with more enhanced flavour of soy sauce.  Also worth mentioning is that the chashu that come with the noodle are super lean (unlike the other ramen places) and tender.  I actually love their pork because they are so tender which make me feel less unhealthy from eating them (always a plus).  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen! I tried the intense version of the clam broth ramen with some trepidation, and it was very yummy! The broth lived up to its name without being too fishy, as I had feared it might be -- and the noodles were perfect. I also really enjoyed the truffle and other garnishes. A satisfying bowl of food indeed.  There was no wait when we arrived for a late Friday night dinner, though the restaurant was busy. Service was noticeably slow to get to us, but when they did, food came out relatively quickly. It's a small but beautiful space. I will probably return to try their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on a Thursday around 12:30 p.m. and there was no line up and I was seated promptly.  We had a mild and an intense signature shoyu ramen and boy, they were awesome.    We liked the fact that the broth was much lighter and the clam in the broth added more depth (umami) to the usual pork broth I've had at other ramen places.  Their egg (extra) was on a tad salty side but I enjoyed the chasu and the bamboo shoots that came in the soup.    Chicken karaage was small but a good addition to the meal as we were both on an hungry side.    I'd definitely come back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this restaurant and I've been following it South Street Burger closes and a new Japanese restaurant was moving in.   The location is kind of incognito (sandwiches  between a DQ and Jack Astor's). But, especially on a weekend, you'll find the front of the restaurant snaked into a loooong line of hungry eaters eagerly waiting to get in. The line was daunting, however, I felt I just had to wait it out and see what the hype was all about. Surprisingly, the turnover quite not as long as I thought (45mins looks short compared to the size of the line and also the size of Konjiki).   Note: the front of the restaurant is actually another restaurant, a Japanese dessert place called \"Saryo\". It's almost exactly like \"Tsijuri\" -that's also 2-3 blocks south on Yonge   Ok... onto the 3 main things:  1) Price - competitive with other ramen places and if anything on the cheaper side, $13-15 (they do have a crazy lobster ramen special only on Wednesdays -limited quantity that's a whooping $28)  2) Atmosphere - casual, fun and flirty(lol, yes I said flirty. The cool tin colored decorations make for a flirty and fun vibe). The size of the restaurant is small but better than most of ramen restaurants around town.  3) Taste - I tried the \"Intense Shoyu clam broth ramen\" ($14) and my my my was it tasty. The clam broth was new for me and it really had a deep intense bold clam flavour. But I think I was most happy with the texture of the ramen. It was al denté but wit a soft touch.   Overall, I think everyone needs to check this small hidden restaurant out in the middle of North York (across from Mel Lastman Sq)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally got around to trying out Konjiki - one of many ramen restaurants in the area. It is attached to Saryo Cafe (which I would like to try out next time - we were too full).   We came here for lunch and it opens at 11:30am - we arrived shortly after and already there was a line. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes and at that point, we had decided what to order already.   Ordered the following:  * Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen (14$) * Spicy Red Tonkotsu Ramen (13$) * Braised Pork Belly (7$)  I had the Spicy Red Tonkotsu Ramen and it was delicious. Very refreshing - a good level of spice that wasn't overwhelming either. Usually I am not keen on broth but this was so good. The marinated pork was tender and went well with the spices. My boyfriend had the Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen and he enjoyed his as well - there was a distinct flavour of the clam broth but preferred the broth from the spicy ramen.   Overall, a good experience and tasty ramen. The wait shouldn't stop you from trying this ramen place. Go give it a taste! Oh and if you're vegetarian, they offer a vegetarian option which a definite plus for veg lovers."}
{"text":"Got the tonkotsu signature ramen for 13+ tax. The soup was really good but part of me wished it was piping hot rather than just... warmish.  I was disappointed by the lack of toppings. Getting an egg cost extra. The sou vide cha siu sounds grand on paper but in reality, it was thin like the number 3 you get over the counter at a meat deli. Honestly it felt like I was eating glorified ham.  I did like the ginger and the mix of flavours in the soup a lot but I don't think I'll come and wait in line in the near future.   Best value, flavour and taste still goes to Sansotei in the North York ramen battlefield."}
{"text":"Honestly, Over-hyped.  The service was nice and the atmosphere was was pretty good but that's about it. (3/5)  Tried the Lobster Ramen(1/5) and Shio Clam Ramen(3/5).   The lobster tasted like a lobster bisque and the peppers they added did not work well with ramen at all. Tasted like spaghetti with soaked in lobster bisque basically. The portion was also super small, pretty much finished it in two slurps.   The Shio Clam Ramen was a little better. For starters, the portion was atleast 2-3 times bigger than the Lobster Ramen. The soup is a clear clam soup base. The truffle is the most expensive part of the ramen but I honestly think it doesn't add anything to the ramen or broth flavor. But what can you expect from a 14 dollar ramen that includes black truffle.   Good to try once but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Passed by this spot this past weekend with my bf to see that the line wasn't extremely long... but after about 5mins of lining up, the line greatly grew for a Sunday after 1pm. For a ramen spot that has a lot of hype buzzing, as Konjiki is a Michelin recommended restaurant - my bf and I had high expectations.   This ramen spot is also conjoined with a cafe at the store front called \"Saryo\", which offers a variety of drinks such as lattes and floats, desserts such as cakes, as well as soft serve (matcha and houjicha)! While waiting to be seated, I decided to try out the houjicha soft serve as it intrigued me the most. It was super delicious and rich in its roasted tea flavor... but I was crushed to not get a full cone serving for paying $6+. I realized that it was just my luck in getting a server that didn't know how to properly twirl a cone because this other server that served the person after me was a pro at twirling a good portion!  Will have to come back to the cafe as the houjicha soft serve was amazing and some of their cakes looked drool worthy!   The hostesses guided us to our seats once seating was finally available after waiting for about 20mins, everyone on the kitchen line that was serving the ramen greeted us upon sitting down (similar as when going to an Izakaya). The signature clam broth ramen (Shoyu) was the one recommended to try, so that's what my bf went for as I tried the black tonkatsu. Both soup bases were flavorful but wasn't as piping hot as ramen should be. We both were also disappointed that a soft boiled egg isn't included with the ramen and is something we had to order separately.   Aside from getting ramen, we had also ordered gyoza and karaange - but was let down as our order never came. Our server did apologize as well as the manager. Even though the experience wasn't the greatest, my bf and I know that things were probably hectic that day being that it was a cold snowy Sunday, it's still their soft opening and they were packed - we'll give them the benifit of the doubt that they were having a bad day."}
{"text":"3.5 Star 'm very hesitant to write a review after only one visit. Maybe because I had great expectations and my experience didn't quite live up to that. My party came in just before 12 on a weekday and only had a 5 minute wait. After 12 pm, it's about a 20-30 minute wait depending on your party size. No wait time for people eating alone.   Our party of four ordered three of the clam based ramen with an egg each, and one bowl of tonkotsu ramen with an egg. First off, the clam ramen comes in intense flavour (aka soy flavoured) or light flavour (aka just clam). I found the broth to be good but the clam flavour isn't very noticeable. It's not like Chinese clam soup or anything like that. The noodles here are very good. I liked the egg as well. You do have to pay for it ($1.50 each) on top of the ramen price (~$14) so it's about $15.50 a bowl plus tax and and tips...  but you do get a whole soft boiled egg. The pork in the ramen is different from other places. There's no fat on these at all. It's a very lean, thin slice of pork. Bland and boring in my opinion.  Maybe I just like my fatty pork. They do offer this but you have to order separately. The tonkotsu ramen has the same kind of pork as the clam ramen but the broth is made from boiling bones and it is very milky colored and rich. This might be the best tonkotsu broth I have ever had (including in Tokyo). Seriously good.   Service was good despite it being busy and everything tasted very fresh. Price is much higher than other places but the ramen here also tasted more refined. It's not the most satisfying bowl though hence 3 stars. I'm not quite a fan yet. Next time I'll try the tonkotsu ramen with the fatty pork and see how that goes."}
{"text":"Got the vegetarian ramen. They changed the coconut milk base to potato and soy milk. It was good but the coconut milk was better IMHO. I Would come back for it when I'm in the area and feeling a vegetarian ramen above the other places."}
{"text":"Oh Toronto...after all this hype about a Michelin rated restaurant coming to our home city, I had to check out what the hype was all about.  I checked in on a Saturday a couple weeks after the soft opening and it was not surprisingly, quite busy.  There were people piled out the door in the waiting area.    The organization in terms of getting people's names to the list was quite poor. Nobody knew what was going on so you had some keeners who went up to try to get ahead and were told to wait back and then you had some confused jo's who were looking around to see what to do.   Turns out, they take in some names and when more people leave and those names get seats, there's a girl who goes back to take more names.  So you just have to wait until they come to take your name.  So don't bother being that annoying person who pushes everyone out of the way to get ahead in the name list.  The other interesting thing about this restaurant is that it's shared with a Japanese cafe that sells desserts and lattes.  I'm not sure if they're owned by the same person but it was a bit silly because there were SO many people waiting for ramen, that they couldn't help but wait in the cafe area and then were told that they couldn't just stand or sit around there b/c it's for customers of the cafe.  I was that \"avocado on toast\" millennial who then proceeded to buy a latte and a green tea brownie and sat there sipping on drink as slow as possible - for an hour, which is how long it took us to wait.    Now for the food itself!  We ordered the clam broth ramen, the clam soy-sauced based ramen, and the smokey tonkotsu ramen.  Overall, the clam broth ramen was totally a different take than those strong, heavy ramens that you traditionally taste (the bone broth ones).  It was light in flavour and there was definitely a hint of truffle.  I can see why, if one is used to the heavy ramens, why they couldn't appreciate this broth more.  However, I really quite enjoyed it.  The soy-sauced clam broth one was not as good, however, because the soy sauce was too overpowering.  The smokey tonkosu ramen is what a lot of people who complained should have gotten because it was that heavy, BAM, umame ramen that Torontonians are used to.  And I quite enjoyed that one too. We also ordered the obligatory karaage...delicious but quite expensive for the 4 pieces you got.   Overall, this place is worth visiting again!"}
{"text":"Totally decent ramen alongside exceptional marketing.  As you wait in line you cannot help to listen to people talking about \"Michelin Star Ramen\".   Which is a total misnomer.  Sure, the small location in Shibuya has been listed as a Bib Gourmand restaurant... but these are kinda a dime a dozen.  There ARE Michelin star ramen joints in Tokyo...  but unless you're willing to get to Tsuta or Nakiryu and wait in long line for their Dandan noodles you're out of luck.   Back to Konjiki. This is a good ramen joint.  Actually, a very very good ramen joint.   But the inconvenience of having to wait through the hypefest to get inside is a bit of a diminishment to what otherwise is a fantastic meal.    The shoyu intense clam broth is an absolute delight.  I would dunk my head in the broth if it wouldn't kill me dead.  I also tried the spicy pork, which was also quite good.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Karage chicken, but it could have been just in comparison to the ramen.   Also, my diet coke was flat.   But you can't win 'em all.  It's the promise of the word 'michelin' that gets 'em through the door.   It's a door worth entering, but concentrate on the actual ramen and broth itself and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"If you want to avoid a long lineup, try to go at around 2-3pm, and you'll probably wait only about 5-10 minutes!   Known for their signature clam shoyu and shio broths, Konjiki is another ramen restaurant that recently opened in the North York area.  Layout is tight and there is limited space, just like most ramen places, and there was nowhere to put our jackets/coats.   Konjiki is a good ramen place with flavourful broth--but a bit overhyped.  You also have to pay extra for an egg or other meat, otherwise the bowl comes with only thin slices of lean pork.  Unfortunately, my egg had a piece of shell still attached, which wasn't very appetizing.    The total came to $40.68 for two ramen bowls with added egg for each, and chicken karaage.  The shoyu, even though it's advertised as  \"intense\" was not overpowering.  The karaage was tasty and crispy.  All in all, good place, but would only return if I didn't have to wait in line. There are so many ramen places around that I'll likely just be rotating between them all.  Next to it is Saryo, a Japanese dessert place that sells delicious matcha and roasted matcha soft serve and lattes, as well as cakes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon for a quick lunch. It was a short wait, even on a weekday. I had been looking forward to trying this for a while. Overall it was good but didn't blow me away. I'll visit again.  Restaurant: The restaurant itself is fairly small and cozy, like other ramen shops. Seating in tight and not the most comfortable.  Food: The ramen selection was limited to just a few choices. The soup was fresh and not heavy like some other places. I was a bit disappointed at their pork belly quality.  Service: The service was good. Our server was attentive and exceeded my expectation for a ramen shop."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon around 12:45pm and there was no line up at all. We were seated at the bar stools, which have handy small hooks for you to hang your bag/jacket.   The service was good, polite, and efficient. We got our food quickly and everything was still hot when it arrived.   We ordered the signature clam broth and the black tonkatsu ramen. Their signature ramen comes in 2 variations: Mild shio and Intense shoyu. Their signature broth is definitely the item to order when you're here. You can taste the clam in their broth, but it wasn't annoyingly ocean-y tasting either. My friend tried both of the broths and preferred the Intense Shoyu signature broth because it was more flavourful. The mild shio is definitely for those who prefer a lighter taste. Also, the chasu that came with the signature ramens was so good! Super tender and juicy pork . The tonkatsu broth came with some black garlic oil. The soup was very rich, but it lacked that deep pork flavour (or it may have just benefitted from some salt...). The noodles were good though! Perfect done-ness and had more of a wheat flavour than other ramen places.  Overall, I meaaaan... it's good, it just wasn't as jaw-dropping as I expected ?"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come due to the mixed reviews for this ramen restaurant, but as a true yelper of course I gotta try it for myself to decide...and I loved it!  Shio vs Shoyu - which one should you order? My friend and I were set on trying the signature clam broth ramen, because that's what they are known for. I got the Intense Shoyu Signature Clam Broth Ramen as that's supposed to be more flavourful (I got influenced by some of the reviewers saying the ramen is tasteless so I ordered the more 'intense' one) and my friend ordered the Shio. We both like the Shio more because you can taste the clam flavour more. You can still taste the clam in Shoyo but it's not as obvious because of the soy sauce. I am absolutely hooked with this light clam soup base and did I mention truffle oil? They add that in the ramen which makes it even more flavourful!! I also like the noodles they used which is more Soba-like and matches the light soup base well. Note that portion is a bit small and it doesn't come with an egg (you gotta add it).  Overall I loved the clam soup base and will definitely return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ate here on the second day of their opening with 3 other friends. We arrived 10 minutes before their lunch service and we were able to get seats, but the line behind us got quite long. I ordered the smoky black tonkotsu as recommended by the server. The pork bone broth was rich but not greasy, full of flavor and only got salty as I finished the last spoonful. The handmade noodles definitely does not disappoint. The portion size is smaller than other places but it was decent. The amount of toppings is again less than other places, but what was there was very delicious. The small charred(?) tomatoes add an extra boost of smokiness.   I tried the signature clam broth ramen and these are not as rich but even more savory. If I go back again, this would be the one I get. The red spicy tonkotsu had a good kick with what I'm guessing is smoked paprika. We also ordered a plate of gyoza to share ($5 for 5 pcs). They tasted very fresh and had ample pork and chive filling. It was very light; I would've liked it more if it was crispier and if the dipping sauce had a bit more tang to it.  Although the space was quite small, I really appreciated that the tables and bar seating still provided enough space for each person to sit comfortably without feeling crammed like I do at most other ramen places. The decor is simple and modern, with thoughtful details like hooks under the table for your coats and bags if you're seated at the bar."}
{"text":"Toronto finally got a taste of a Michelin star ramen restaurant from Japan and the ramen was definitely different from most other ramen places I've been to. I got the Shio clam ramen which I recommend over the Shoyu (I tried my friend's soup). The ramen soup honestly was so good and I really enjoyed the truffle paste on the pork. Overall, the ramen experience as a whole was great - 4/5. Onto the reason why I am only giving a 3 star review .... 1) pricey and 2) there was a huge line to sit down (40 min + wait) and our waitress also missed our order which resulted in us waiting another 30 minutes before our food arrived. As such, this was not the most enjoyable experience given all the chaos and having to chase our order. However, once the hype dies down, I'd love to come back and try the other ramens."}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to check out this place last night after hearing so much hype and it is by far the best ramen places I've ever had.   Upon arriving, I thought there would be a huge line and was expecting to wait longer than 30 minutes. But we came on a Sunday night (7pm) and was quickly seated after 15 minutes of waiting.   LOCATION  In front of the restaurant is Saryo Cafe that sells matcha soft serve, lattes and cakes. Makes it hard to turn down a sweet treat after having a heart-warming bowl of ramen (which we did!). Smart idea that they would combine both places under one roof.  Small and narrow restaurant, not a lot of tables but I find it pretty cool they have a bar with stools in the middle of the restaurant. Makes dining for 1 less awkward.   Modern decor, loud environment, plays top 40 music   SERVICE  The staff loudly greets you as you are brought to your table. Speedy service. Asked for water as we made our order and waiter asked if we wanted hot or tap water which I appreciate the thoughtfulness. Each table has a box of chopsticks, spoons and toothpicks (rare) which I thought was a nice touch.   FOOD The gyoza was smaller than I had expected but nonetheless it was still tasty and it had the crispy bottom. Nothing spectacular... would probably not order again.   I ordered the Smoky Black Tonkotsu as my main (no add on's) and I can't even formulate sentences on how amazing this ramen was.   The broth was rich, full of flavour, not overly salty or oily and you can taste the smokey/garlicky flavour. The noodles were cooked perfectly, al dente... soft yet still had a bite. Good noodles to broth ratio. Finished the ramen and every drop of broth.    I have tried other ramen places but Konjiki is not comparable to the other ones. I've never had a ramen that was this comforting and satisfying. I left the restaurant in a complete euphoric state and a happy stomach."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen places in Toronto with light (but flavourful) ramen broth. I will come again, but won't make it my go to ramen place as it is higher priced compared to competitors.  The wait was about 20 minutes, and it took about 5 minutes to get the ramen. Appetizers were a bit slower.   I ordered the Shoyu Clam Broth ramen. It's in clam, pork and chicken broth. The clam flavour wasn't very strong, and broth had the perfect level of sat. The broth is more of a clear based broth and mild.   The chashu pieces were thinly sliced and very lean, literally hate no fat on it. The noodles were thin and more floury than typical egg ramen noodles.   The karage chicken was very good and comes with a side of horseradish mayo. The breading was very thin which made the outside nice and crispy.   The gyoza was nothing special, typical pork shrimp dumplings. I wouldn't order them again as they didn't stand out compared to the other dishes."}
{"text":"While Toronto is home to a large variety of fantastic food, ramen has always been lacking, particularly in comparison to Vancouver. But, Konjiki might just be the new kid on the block to change that.   Before I begin, I want to set expectations very clear. Konjiki's clam based broth is very different from most other miso or tonkatsu style broths and should be treated as such. I initially went in comparing Konjiki to my recent experience at the NYC based Ippudo and YVR based Ramen Danbo and it was a mistake. I didn't enjoy the experience in the moment, and questioning the veracity of this Bib Gourmand-status chain. But, after some time and reflection on my meal, I realized it's like comparing apples to oranges. While they did offer the more traditional styles of broth, my brother and I chose the clam based shio and the clam based shoyu. Both were served with truffle and infusions of mushroom, 3 slices of char sui and green onions. As described on the menu, the shio is milder, while the shoyu is richer and deeper. What I believe earns this restaurant it's esteemed status is the unique and intricate style of the clam based broth. Unlike many other ramens I've experienced which tend to be much saltier and thicker, this broth was light and delicate. Think french consommes vs. american stews. There is nothing wrong with either, just an absolute difference in style and texture. Some reviewers mentioned the noodles getting soggy but, I didn't really experience this. The noodles were a little starchier feeling than some other ramen places which have a bit more spring and bounce but, it helped to absorb and intensify all the different levels of flavour. In fact, I found the density and texture of noodle really helped to retain a lot of the glam and truffle flavor with each bite.   In addition to the ramen, we also had the sous vide pork belly with egg, side of egg, side of menma and gyoza. The pork belly was good, well balanced with fat and flavour. I don't know that it stood out enough to re-order but if you like simple pork belly, try it. The egg was delicious and the menma was marinated very well. The gyoza was probably the most underwhelming and tasted like any other gyoza.   Overall, if you would like a unique ramen experience, try out Konjiki. I wouldn't necessarily crave it like I do some other ramen places but, the simple yet multi-layered flavour of the broth is so different, I would absolutely come back again."}
{"text":"We came here based off from a recommendation from a friend. On a Sunday 12:30pm, we waited for 15 minutes for a table of two then the line picked up after we left. I ordered the shio signature clam broth ramen.   I tried the broth from both signature clam based ramen; shoyu and shio. I definitely prefer the lighter flavour. Shio all the way! The broth was flavourful and the salty clam taste lingers afterward just a bit. I really liked the amount of raw green onions in the bowl. Very crisp and refreshing both the broth and green onions mixed together.   The broth have a lot of flavours and natural sweetness. It's not bland and you'll leave feeling full, satisfied and warm.  The slices of chashu was all right... I was expecting it to be more tender since the menu advertised it to be sous vide. The delicate cuts of chashu that came with the ramen are super lean. Too bad the ramen bowl didn't come with the soft boiled egg.  Food was solid across the board and the service were quick and attentive. If you are in the neighborhood and want ramen then check this place out. There is street parking and residential parking all around though public transit would be a good option too."}
{"text":"Parking: Free after certain hours on the side. Green P parking lot located nearby as well, I forgot the flat rate.  Queue: Well.....lets just say it was one hell of a line-up on the day I went to go eat at this joint. I don't know how long I've waited (could have been an hour? or longer?) but in my mind I was thinking \"This better be worth the wait....the HYPE IS REAL!\".  Washrooms: Very clean. It's a new place so it's expected.  Experience/Venue:  The staff wore gloves while handling the food and it was sanitary from what I could see. It's very fast paced, fast serving in there so I was quite impressed. The venue is small and divided into two sections, the dining area where those who come to order the ramen and a separate area where you can order desserts.  Food: I ordered a vegan style ramen. Does it live up to it's Michelin star award rating? It was probably one of the best ramen's I've had. At this point it beats out Kinton."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour when we came at 1pm on a weekday. However, we had a group of 7 and were seated at the bar. In our group, we had several friends from out of the country and we had chosen konjiki because of their Michelin rating. Honestly, we all felt it was over hyped. The ramen was tasty but we enjoy other ramen establishments a bit more. The price is average. I believe that the higher price is due to the quality of ingredients rather than the name or portion size, which is fair. The portions were small. Upon receiving my bowl, the first thing I noticed was the lack of soup. There is very little soup which I assume is because we are expected to drink all of it, which is did! It did not taste too salty, and was quite flavourful while being light. I got the original house flavour listed first on the menu. I tried to taste different sides of the bowl before mixing and did notice some unique flavours. Overall, I wish there was a little bit more soup and meat. The noodles were delicious and perfectly cooked as well. The servers were attentive and the space inside is tight. There are hooks under the table but very poorly designed which do not hold much. My knee length jacket as touched the floor while hanging and took up all the leg space under the bar."}
{"text":"Portions are too small especially for the price you're paying for. It is $14 for a small bowl of ramen, there was only one tiny thin slice of pork in the Signature Clam Shoyu and the egg is an extra $1.50.   The service was great though, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Walked in at around a quarter after six on a Tuesday night. Wait time is only 15 mins, which is okay.   We ordered the spicy tonkotsu and the black tonkotsu ramen, along with a chicken karage ( fried chicken). I have to say the food quality is really high and I can understand why it is a Michelin 1 star restaurant. However, the portion is actually not very satisfying that's why I am giving it a 4 star instead of 5. They don't have toppings in the ramen so you have to order in separate, which makes your ramen 17-18 dollars.   Also we sat on the bar table, there are no place for us to hang our purses or jackets. It is a bit inconvenient for us.   Overall the experience is great. I will probably stop by next time and also try the desert place."}
{"text":"Ramen is really good here!!!! Lunch for my myself costed $31.50 plus tip. One small beer, one tonkatsu ramen, one Pork belly with tamago.  Tonkatsu Ramen is 4 stars!! $13 plus tax and tip, so $17.50. Cha Sui was really really really thin and was cold :(, if you zoom into my Ramen pic, and look at the thickness compared to the shouts and ginger.. you will see how thin those slices were...  really satisfied with Ramen and soup :)  Same Quality Ramen in Tokyo.. probably less then $10USD, no tax, tip needed.. considering it didn't come with tamago and the char sui was sooooo thin..    2 star = wouldn't return even if someone wanted to go  3 star = would return if someone wanted to go, but wouldn't suggest going 4 star = recommend!!! Let's GO!! 5 star = WOW!!!!! Best of the best!! Must try!!! Montreal Schwartz)"}
{"text":"Shibuya, Tokyo-based Konjiki Ramen - full name Konjiki Hototogisu or Golden Bird - is a Michelin enorsed (but not starred) ramen joint whose second location is in Toronto now several doors down from the progressively worse and worse Kinton (their broth and chashu really need to improve), Hakata Shoryuken (at least they offer a special local flavour and take on ramen) and Sansotei (whose tonkotsu neither tastes like nor smells like tonkotsu!). Konjiki offers clam-based broth, which is not uncommon in Japan, but is new for Canada.  We arrived at 11:00, which is 30 minutes before opening time, and were at the head of the line. By the time they opened at 11:30 there were a good 30 people in line. This is an authentic Japanese restaurant so of course all our Chinese-Canadian friends are in line. Add to that Korean-Canadians and a smattering of others.  They are not Michelin endorsed in Canada of course, but still their clam-based ramen (in white bowls) was good. They also have tonkotsu (pork bone broth), which i have to try another time, but I had their signature clam-based ramen and would say the shoyu is good and the shio is just average/medium. While I enjoyed the novelty of the clam broth, the shio had little taste. The shoyu was better. In both cases the chashu (pork meat) is really thin and stingy and looks like a cold cut sliced thinly. The ramen is $14 and I am sure they can make their chashu thicker to look like an actual piece of meat that belongs in a ramen! For the price an egg is not included either. The noodle also was a cross between a ramen noodle and soba noodle. This is not your standard ramen noodle. The waitress told us they make their own noodles in-house. In both cases the ramen had a pleasant aroma. The clam-based broth works best on the sense of smell. They also have below average chicken nuggets (karaage) and a vegetarian option for ramen.  The service was polite, we got a quality check and the water is refilled as necessary. Unlike Santouka, however, not all employees are Japanese.   The restaurant is clean, spic and span and on the way out you are funneled through a partnership's ice cream/cake store (very much the same trick used by Ikea) where you have to walk through the pastry shop. By the way a slice of Mont Blanc cake is $8. Not joking. I repeat: a thin slice is $8. Obviously Canada makes another millionaire out of another ramen entrepreneur.  It is a  minimum of 30 minutes wait, and more likely 60 minutes, but give it a try if you like ramen because the chef/owner is returning to Japan next month leaving the restaurant in the hands of his trainees.  We enjoyed the novelty of a clam broth, but shoyu is better than the watery shio and the novelty should wear off because the meat is so thin and the taste is not spectacular (just 'good')."}
{"text":"Amazing and I keep going here whenever possible! Try to get there before 11:45am to avoid the crowds"}
{"text":"After much hype,  this place finally opened.   But buyer beware.  This is not a michelin star restaurant.  In fact,  they have zero michelin star.    What they do have is a michelin Bib gourmand recommendation. Michelin is basically saying they recommend its tokyo restaurant based on price/value.  Does this restaurant in toronto deserve the michelin recommendation?  The answer is no!   The ramen is average at best.  The soup base taste too salty and it tastes manufactured.     Average joint at best.   Something is off with the taste.  There are better places in the area.   I would pass until i see better reviews."}
{"text":"Visited on 9 Feb 2018 around 6pm.  Ordered vegetarian ramen because I don't like salty soup base. The soup of vegetarian ramen was very like taste of sesame oil and full and deep flavour.  One thing made me uncomfortable after I finished this was diarrhea.  I am intolerance lactose and the soy milk, I am pretty sure the contents of soy milk is very close to milk."}
{"text":"My rating is closer to a 3.5 than a 4.   Going in, I already knew not to have crazy expectations of this place solely for the Michelin star. This review is purely on my standalone opinion of the food.   I ordered the Signature Clam Broth Shio ramen and my sister ordered the Smoky Black Tonkotsu ramen. We also ordered a side of the Pork Chashu Don.  Signature Clam Broth Shio - not bad but not amazing either. I found this broth to be incredible mediocre. I didn't think there was much depth to the flavour of the broth, so that was quite disappointing. I definitely enjoyed the hint of truffle oil in it as it added such a nice smell which made having this ramen more enjoyable. The pork was not very flavourful and was very small.  Oh and I also added an egg to this, as it does not come with it. I know a lot of people complained about the texture of their egg, but I did not find this to be an issue. It was definitely not as runny as most other ramen places, but I actually preferred this because when I cut into the egg, I didn't lose the entire yolk in the soup broth. It was runny and firm enough to be able to break it into smaller pieces and enjoy it in more bites!  Smoky Black Tonkotsu - I have to say, I ended up taking multiple scoops of broth out of my sisters bowl. Compared to my choice, this one definitely had a lot more flavour. It was extremely garlicky and creamy, which I loved. Unfortunately, the meat it came with was not the pork slices, but more so pieces of ground meat. I was thrilled when my sister said she was too full to finish her ramen, as I instantly swapped mine for hers. I have to say though, that although I did enjoy the flavour of this ramen more than mine, I wasn't able to have too much of it in one go. At one point, it started tasting a bit too creamy and garlicky. So I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this one.  Pork Chashu Don- this came near the end of our meal so we were already too full to fully enjoy this. But I don't think this changes my review. I was really disappointed by this because it tasted so dry. The individual ingredients were just \"okay\" and there was hardly any sauce to be found to wrap all the flavours together. Really really sad about this.   Overall, this place was just alright even though slightly overpriced. I would definitely consider coming back and trying their other dishes, but only when there is no longer a lineup."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is not bad. The reason why I gave 1 star is because they DO NOT respect people who eat here. I'm a ramen person but I prefer to have vinegar in my ramen. However, there is no vinegar here because the chef thought people who put vinegar in ramen is disrespecting of his work. That is nonsense. I've been to numerous places for ramen and every time I've had vinegar. It's like my thing. Definitely not combing back."}
{"text":"Good signature clam broth Shoyu ramen. Great customer service with beautiful dine-in area. Overall love it"}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to live in Tokyo and the ramen selection and variety is ridiculous. Unfortunately, ignorance is bliss. I often find my mind going to that pretentious place travellers often go. The \"insert dish\" is sooo much better at \"insert place\" comment.   Fortunately, the staff at konjiki are the real deal. I know, because I met some of them over in a ramen festival in Japan. They flew over staff and translators and you can taste the difference. This place is my favourite ramen spot in Toronto. I would travel for this place to fill cravings.   It's a little salty for some tastes but I find it more authentic. The lobster ramen. Was. Life changing.   And when you're done just go next door (same spot) to get dessert. It was the best matcha ice cream I've had too.   Quality spot"}
{"text":"It was a rainy night and I was craving noodles, so I decided to finally try this place out! There weren't a lot of people that night and we were seated right away in the center. The servers were nice and friendly, even my partner commented on how good the service was compared to other places.   We ordered one of each, the Shoyu and Shio, and were pleasantly satisfied with both. Personally I preferred the Shio as the broth was lighter and easier to finish. I can definitely see why the others on here recommend this place for their broth!  If I had to be super picky, I do wish the portions were a bit larger and that the eggs were not add-ons."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this Michelin recommended ramen spot for a while. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and waited for an hour. The menu is simple and the signature clam broth ramen ($14) is a must try! It was on the pricey side but the noodles were amazing (only one type) and the soup didn't taste oily at all. The special tonkatsu ramen ($13) was good as well, with same sous vide chasiu and noodles, and similar toppings as the signature. The service was fast. This could possibly be my new favourite ramen joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"Living up to it's hype. A Michelin star ramen joint from Japan, their broth (which includes clams) is excellent and sousviding the pork (Chashu) is a smart move on their part. It ensures your not getting dried out meat like you do at many ramen joints.  Price is a little higher than you're probably used to in the area, but in line with similar offerings like at Momofuku's joints downtown T.O/New York."}
{"text":"The ambience and aesthetics at this place is definitely a 5/5 rating and it's wonderful how this restaurant has an ice cream bar right next to it, perfect for a dessert/hangout place after dinner. After waiting ~30 minutes for a spot, we got the signature shio clam broth ramen ($14) and the chicken karaage ($5). The ramen had a unique seafood taste to it however was a bit too salty, but the chicken karaage came with sauce which had a hint of wasabi, making it the highlight of the meal! We also got the hojicha roasted green tea latte float ($6.50) which was amazing!! But overwhelmed by the amount of ice they put in (even tho we asked for less ice haha). So overall the aesthetics and service was great, however taste and price is negotiable."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch around 1:00 pm. The lineup isn't super long, but we waited till 2:00 pm to get a table for 5, because they actually share half of the space with another restaurant (Saryo). I ordered their signature clam broth ramen (shoyu). The broth is literally just soy sauce, it doesn't come with an egg and has no clam flavor at all (maybe a little bit). The ramen is very normal, I feel like I can just make the broth on my own. Overall, it isn't bad, but just nothing special."}
{"text":"Best in the city! Great addition to have another ramen shop like this! I think the negative reviews are just based on having to wait so long, which is not their fault, and just out of this world expectations. This is amazing ramen perfected in Japan and we are fortunate to be the first overseas branch!"}
{"text":"I think it worth the wait, however for a Michelin star ramen place I thought the ramen should be made by \"God's\"... lol Staff and the ambiance were great! Friendly, accommodating staff. The ramen was good except it was tooooo salty.  But still the best ramen I had in Toronto. Mind that you have to pay extra for the egg that usually comes with the ramen. Paid $20 for a ramen and green tea. The only complain, ramen could definitely use less salt! I had to keep drinking water hours after I left this hot and new ramen place."}
{"text":"Long line up time for dinner:P but the broth and noodles are of high quality. However, I prefer Kinton Ramen. Konjiki is more expensive."}
{"text":"Second time at konjiki. The first time I was her, they only had three ramen options (it was a Wednesday and they only serve the clam broth ramens and the lobster ramen. We went for the clam broth ramen ($28 for a lobster ramen seems a bit excessive). The noodles were perfectly cooked and the clam broth super savoury.   The second time we went was a Friday and the line was super long. We were able to get a table relatively quickly at the bar. This time, we went for the tonkatsu ramen (spicy red and smoky black). The broth was flavourful but almost overly creamy. The chicken karaage was a perfect pairing since the ramen does not come with any protein.   I will be back but would look to avoid the lines"}
{"text":"It wasn't as good as I expected. The ramen were pretty average and definitely not worth a long wait."}
{"text":"I've been back a few more times and the service has improved a lot !!  It was already pretty decent for a ramen restaurant, but they definitely surprised me.   The broth is consistent and always hot. The noodles are way more than enough for me and the meat is still tender af.   Really pleased that they have maintained their high quality half a year later."}
{"text":"I came here with pretty low expectations expecting it to be comparable to Sansotei or Santouka Ramen and I was still disappointed. The lineup for us on a Thursday evening was about 45 minutes around dinner time. We ordered a Shoyu and Shio broth ramen with a tamago each and a side of karaage to split. The karaage was nothing great so I would recommend passing on it. I had the Shio and the broth was pretty good, definitely lighter and you could taste the clam base. The noodles were perfect, but other aspects of the bowl left me wanting more. The chashu just wasn't doing anything for me, the truffle oil felt like an unnecessary touch, and the egg was well overdone ($1.50 extra). Overall the bowl of ramen was just average to me. I tried some of my friend's shoyu ramen and as other posters have said here, the soy sauce just overpowers any clam flavour. After having actual Michelin rated ramen at Tsuta in Tokyo, this doesn't come anywhere close.  Overall, it's a good place to eat ramen if you are in the area, but I wouldn't specifically make a trip out to eat it. I will be back again sometime to try their Tonkotsu bowls to give them a fair shake, but I will wait until the lines die down in 3 months."}
{"text":"Came here and the service was great, but the ramen was not too much to my taste. I got the clam broth truffle ramen which is the signature and it was not bad but it just tasted like truffle with light soup.... wasn't a mind blowing combination or anything amazing.   I prefer the rich flavourful broths at kinton/other ramen shops. I might come back to try the other ramen.   I'm glad I didn't line up when this place just opened. When I came there wasn't a line up anymore :)"}
{"text":"I went to Konjiki on their first soft opening day, but have decided to put off this review until I revisited.  For my first visit, i tried their signature clam broth ramen in Shoyu style. The broth here is special in that it is actually a mix of clam, pork and chicken broth, and this tri-broth is the one true differentiating element that separates them from the rest. You can actually taste the different broths if you refrain from mixing the ramen upon arrival - just carefully dip your spoon into different corners of the bowl and give it a try!  For $14, the ramen comes with 1 very thinly sliced piece of pork, and it costs extra for egg and pork belly addition. However, I was not satiated at end given that the portion size was small for the price.  For my second visit, I tried their Spicy tonkotsu ramen. I found the broth to be a bit too thick for my liking. The flavour was not that special and I found it to be tad too salty. There is definitely better tonkotsu ramen elsewhere, and I would suggest diners to stick to their clam broth ramen instead. I also tried their karaage - they did an ok job with it, but I found the crispiness of the batter lacking.  Overall I found konjiki to have the tastiest Shoyu-style ramen I have tried in Toronto, but portion size is disappointing for a bowl that was close to $23 after tax and tip. 4 stars for this place."}
{"text":"I came for the second time. The ramen is delicious as usual, however they gave me a weird shape egg for my side order.  It doesn't look like the advertising image tho"}
{"text":"Worth the hype!   I love ramen so when my friend mentioned this new joint in north york, I made it a point to come check it out.  Luckily we arrived right when they open at 11:30 for lunch otherwise we would be waiting for at least 45 mins for second seating.    I ordered the miso clamp broth ramen. It was so refreshing from the traditional pork broth.  the broth was very tasty and the noodles were at a perfect texture. We also ordered the fried chicken which I thought it was ok.   Their black ramen weren't available during lunch time so I will have to come back and check it out next time."}
{"text":"5 minutes away from the North York Centre train station. Waited in line for at least 45 minutes both times when I was there.   The Signature Clam Broth Ramen are must tries if you come here. My personal favorite is the Mild Shio ramen. The soup base was very flavourful and unique with a mixed taste of calm and pork. It doesn't taste just like the typical ramen you can get from any other ramen places."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong... this is a pretty decent bowl of ramen... but any restaurant associated with Michelin automatically raises my expectations. The broth was quite nice as you can taste a hint of clams and the other ingredients used. It is however significantly lighter than typical ramen broths in Toronto. The biggest turn off for me were the noodles as they tasted like Chinese noodles from Chinatown. Not worth the hype and trip to North York at all."}
{"text":"I went to North York just to try it. The line wasn't that long when I went on Saturday around 2:30. I waited maybe 10 minutes?  I sat at the middle bar area, the space is really cramped. There were two lines, one for the dessert, one for the ramen. Also, when I was seated I saw the line getting long.  I ordered their Shio Clam Broth Ramen with a tamago. I was worried that the egg would be hard boiled, as it was mentioned in several reviews, but nope it was soft boiled. Very nice texture.  The noodle itself is thin but chewy. The clam broth was nice. I couldn't taste the mushroom sauce, but I did taste a bit of the truffle sauce. The bamboo shoot was crunchy. I didn't like their chashu, it tasted more like chicken than pork, it was also very thin. The bowl with the egg costed $17 so it is expensive. It also has less portion than Santouka. So it's expensive but I feel is a pretty good bowl of ramen.  I also grabbed a matcha brownie from their dessert place, it tasted great, soft and moist. Nice matcha flavor. Although pretty small piece for $3.50. I saw someone grabbing a matcha soft serve, this also looked really delicious. Although a bit cold for today."}
{"text":"Seating staff tried to seat our party of three separately. Twice. After telling them that we're not ok with it. Who does that?"}
{"text":"went here for lunch on a Friday as soon as it opened and there was already a line by the timenwe got there which was 11:45am. it opens at 11:30am daily. we waited for approximately 45mins - they don't call/txt but you can leave and come back within the alotted time without losing your spot  the service was friendly and speedy. I got the spicy red ramen for $13 and added on an egg for $1 extra. i was surprised that it came with a whole egg instead of half (something I'm used to normally). it was cooked to perfection - the yolk was gooey and soft but not runny. the ramen bowl looked appealing and the taste was definitely unusual but in a good way. it had a hint of curry as the after taste but it complimented so well with the broth. the broth itself was rich and savoury - the use of beans in this dish really surprised me by adding a gritty flavour. in general, it was a good bowl of ramen. i definitely would come back to try other flavours"}
{"text":"There clam based soup is delicious. Some people might find it too light but I like the gentle seafood flavour"}
{"text":"Came here during their 3rd day of opening. It was Sunday 2:30pm and there was a lineup, waited about 20 mins (some tables were empty but I think the staff was too busy).  The confusing thing was I wasn't sure if we put our name down or line up because ppl werent really in a line. I saw a lady with a clipboard calling names so I walked up to the front and ask if I can put my name down. She said no and just said stand in line. I tho for a new restaurant this is not very welcoming and it was confusing. So I just stood there and waited in the middle of the so call line. Then another man came by and started calling names. Some ppl that had their name down sat down in the dessert area. Finally he took my name down and waited.  Ramen was indeed very good. Soup was delicious, however the soup was not hot. It was more just warm. Personally, I like hot soup.  The price is kind of on the pricer side compare to other ramen shops esp it did not come with the egg with the price."}
{"text":"I work right across Konjiki Ramen, the hottest Michelin-recommended ramen shop in Toronto right now. The small restaurant shares space with Saryo Cafe, a Japanese dessert shop. I skipped out on it when I was at Konjiki because I wanted to try their soft-serve when summer hits.  I got there at around 11:15 AM on a weekday, 15 minutes before it opened. My cousin and I were third in line. No more than 10 minutes later, the lineup grew rapidly. Being third in line allowed us to get a table to ourselves instead of being placed at a communal table. I decided to go for the Signature Clam Broth Ramen. This can be a hit or miss for some people because a couple of my friends weren't a fan of it. I, on the other hand, quite liked it! It was very light and definitely felt like I had the healthiest ramen option possible. My cousin remarked that it didn't have much flavour. If you are a ramen traditionalist and prefer thicker noodles and a heavier broth, then I recommend going for another ramen like the Smoky Black Tonkatsu Ramen.  I was in and out of the restaurant within 30 or so minutes. You will get swift service and the manager might come by to tell you more about the ramen. I really like how efficient and attentive the staff at Konjiki Ramen was. I wouldn't say I am crazy about the ramen but I definitely enjoyed it. I recommend if you have the ability to go for lunch time, drop by at least 15 minutes before opening to get ahead of the crowd. By the time I left, there was a huge line up. Don't go with more than one other person because it's a tiny shop with limited seating."}
{"text":"Specialty ramen compared to the rest of the ramen shop offerings in the area. Avoid coming here during peak hours and you won't wait in line for more than 15 minutes.  I've tried their shoyu ramen, shio ramen, and veggie ramen. Here's a breakdown of what I think about each of them.  Shio ramen is for the purists who want to try an untainted version of their deliciously light clam, chicken, and pork broth. The truffle oil complimented the soup wonderfully, and each area of the ramen truly had a different flavour profile. The noodles had a great mouthfeel and if I was to come back, this would be my order.  Shoyu ramen has added depth in flavour from their soy sauce. If you like more intense flavours in your clear ramen soup, this is for you. My boyfriend loved it and was very appreciative of the sweet and salty flavour profile of the ramen.  Veggie ramen was so beautiful and the individual components of the dish were amazing, but the potato soy milk broth was too salty. I won't lie, I still think about this ramen even though I'm a meat lover, but I was so disappointed with how salty it was. The tofu nuggets were delicious, the beets were beautifully cooked, the sweet potato provided great flavour and texture contrast, and the truffle oil complimented the overall dish. But the broth, while I could tell how good it was supposed to be, was too salty. If they just improved that component of the dish, it would be on my order rotation here.  Overall, I'd recommend it to friends, but it's not worth it to line up for more than 20 minutes. You're better off eating somewhere else. It's definitely on my restaurant rotation list though, so if you live in the area, it's worth a try. Next up: lobster ramen!"}
{"text":"Good flavourful broth. Red spicy tonkotsu has some weird oregano taste in it.  Also the chili oil makes it feel buttery.  Traditional tonkotsu was delicious along with their house made hand crafted noodle. The char shu was mediocre. The ginger didn't contribute to much additional flavor & tasted odd. Gyoza was comme ci comme ça."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Might be the best ramen anywhere I've had including in Toronto, Hawaii and Japan!    Got a table for two at noon on Sunday. We were lucky and didn't have to wait, but a line up did form behind us once we were seated.   Tried the mild shio clam based broth and loved it. Incredibly clean broth and quality ingredients are used, which really makes a difference. $14 for the base bowl without any add-ons is a little pricier than other places, but definitely worth the extra couple bucks. Broth was not salty like most other ramen places, but still delicious - first time I ever finished the broth in a ramen shop.  Pork was delicious and very tender. Get the egg add-on - it was perfectly runny and soft - amazing.   Gyoza was good but a little small and not as crispy as I like them.   Can't wait to come back - this will be my new ramen joint from now on.  Not sure if I can go to any other ramen place now in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Signature shio clam soup ramen ($14) Came with 4 pieces of fatty Cha siu, white truffle oil, bamboo shoots and vegetables. The broth tasted very clammy, which was different but I found it really oily. After taking pics of our ramen, the oil and fat from the soup kinda hardened up at the top already - meaning the soup wasn't even that hot.  Smokey black tonkatsu ramen ($13) Vame with roasted cherry tomatoes, minced pork, bamboo shoots and vegetables. I actually liked the flavour of the Tonkatsu ramen broth more, really rich in flavour. Could have used more of the black roasted garlic oil though cause I couldn't taste much of it.  I hate it when ramen doesn't come with soft boiled eggs, especially when the ramen is $10+. Anyhow we added a soft boiled egg for $1.50 and it comes out being pretty much fully cooked, the yolk was definitely fully set. We asked the waitress about it and she said she will ask the chef to cut it in half and bring a new one out. The new one that was out looked exactly the same. I don't think they understood what the problem was....  I had no expectations going in yet I was still quite disappointed. Definitely overhyped. I'm glad I didnt have to line up for this. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"If it's in soft opening mode should it be rated? Is this a beta testing? Should I just not review and wait for the true launch?  I'll give my two cents for the beta. Kinda underwhelmed. I wouldn't line up for this after trying it. But going at around 6ish you can get in with no wait with luck as we did.   smokey black tonkotsu ramen + egg for extra: Honestly underwhelmed. It had a smokey flavour and alot of salt but it was kinda cold and the noodles were a bit colder and harder than I like. Kinda surprised the noodles are made in house. The broth was rich but what I noticed in alot of ramen places in Tokyo and even Toronto is tons of salt.  Gyoza: decent, some browness from the pan frying but I prefer a bit more crispy browness. Good filling though.  Karaage: crispy skin but the meat was kind of dry.  My friend tried the signature clam broth ramen and he said he didn't really like it, the noodles were also really cold and clam broth lacked flavour.  You can see from the pics, the eggs are broken. The presentation suffers. We're truly paying full price for a beta testing here.  Overall, I would try their other ramen dishes when their soft opening is over but wouldn't line up for it. There was quite a large lineup when we left at around 7pm. I also doubt I'll try a place in soft opening again."}
{"text":"We tried the signature shio and shoyu, as well as the spicy red tonkotsu. The three tasted great, but I think what really stood out to me was the excellent clam broth. Clams have always gone so well with noodles so it's great that Toronto finally has an amazing clam ramen to enjoy!   I would say that the shio really highlighted the profile and taste of the clam broth, while I think the broth acts as more of an enhancer for the shoyu. Both tasted fantastic, but I'm going to be a little partial to the shio.   The matcha cheesecake and the parfait were pretty good too. I recommend the hojicha latte, it will make you forget about the cold weather for a while."}
{"text":"My friends and I came on the second day to a growing modest line-up. Inside the shop, we were funnelled past Saryo, a little built-in dessert shop with clean lines and smooth wooden finish. This abruptly changed into a more industrial feel with barnboard wood panelling, black metal ceiling cages that were both display platforms and simple decor, with bare light fixtures--seating consisted of group tables on the walls with a long island of row seating with bar chairs. Interesting design.  We ordered the signature clam broth ramen (shoyu), spicy red tonkotsu, and smoky black tonkotsu. At first glance, portion sizes appeared to be slightly smaller, with bowls with straight sloping sides (similar to Kinton). Contrary to some earlier images showing generous servings of meat (which I surmise are those of the private tasting), I received only two thin slices of the chashu. After sampling my friends' broths I dove into mine and it quickly dematerialized. The broth is markedly lighter than what I've had before: deep-seated savouriness, clam flavour coming in clear without being overtly or unpleasantly fishy, minimally if at all oily, and overall very soulful. It was quite salty as I've come to expect from ramen broths but not overwhelmingly so that I'm compelled to empty my glass of water at all. I loved the texture of the noodles. Supple and a pleasant chew, a worthy and robust vector for a nice broth. The bamboo shoots were firmer almost to the point of a lush crisp, but not unpleasantly so. The chashu I received, one slightly fatty and one lean, was alright, almost inconsequential support in the background of excellent noodles and broth. Of my friend's broths, I enjoyed the spicy red tonkotsu very much; equally hearty and soulful, with a deceivingly measured heat in the mouth with an exciting build up as it travels down the throat.  We decided to finish with some sweets, ordering the hojicha sundae and the signature parfait. Both we found were noticeable improvements over the average Japanese matcha soft serves, being creamier, while still balanced and not overly sweet.  Overall Konjiki is definitely worth a visit. I hope that this visit is only a baseline indication of more to come, with the chef staying true to his intent of leveraging local ingredients to incorporate and elevate a Japanese staple."}
{"text":"A refreshing take on ramen!  On the outside, Konjiki seems like another typical ramen place which shares the street front with a interesting Japanese cafe. As make your way down the hall in line, you slowly see a fairly sizeable restaurant that seats about 40 to 50 people. Inside, it has a very cool communal central central that is flanked by small tables around the edge. Don't worry if the line seems long, it moved pretty quickly for us as we were looking for a table for 2 on a Friday night (took about 15 mins). However, watch out if you are coming with a party bigger than 4, as seating will be tough. We grabbed a pair of seats on the central table where they have coat hooks attached underneath - I thought that was a neat design. Waitress came by quickly and offered us hot water or tea.  On to the food, the menu is pretty simple - 5 types of ramen where their signature is the clam broth. I ordered Shoyu ramen while my wife tried the vegetarian ramen. They have some small dishes like gyoza and karaage which I will have to come back to try. The noodles came fairly quickly - superb presentation especially the vegetarian one. I took a sip of the broth - wow - it was light but very flavourful with taste of clam while not being too rich. It had a great taste that had me drinking several spoons before getting to the noodles. The noodles were done perfect - initially I was worried about the portion but it was filling. Bamboo shoots were soft and yummy while the sous vide pork was super soft with subtle flavours of the truffle. This was definitely a winner. For vegetarian one, we weren't sure what to expect as most places serve a plain veggie broth but Konjiki went above and beyond to create a rich and thick creamy soup that coated the noodles perfectly. There were some nice slices of pickled beets, tofu nuggets and onions to round it out. Amazing flavour profile which had a creamy taste to it. It is one of only places where I drank all the soup!  Overall, we loved Konjiki - it is different in a good way with subtle and complex flavours. Sorta like classic ramen but refined to the next level. This will not replace the traditional rich pork based ramen but it serves as a great complement."}
{"text":"I had the mild Shio Ramen. Good broth. Chewy but delicate noodles. Gyoza was ok...not outstanding but very nicely done. Hubby tried the Shoyu Ramen....said he liked the Shio better after I let him taste mine. Good friendly service. Nice ambience for lunch. Would recommend to friends and would come again for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely worth your buck ! Very friendly staff and absolutely delicious ramen. I got the spicy shoyu ramen and you can tell how truly rich the broth is. It is a small place and you may find yourself waiting maybe more than 10 minutes at certain times but I definitely think this place is worth a try. I would definity come back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out last weekend. Very good ramen, on a lighter side (not very hearty). Only pork & vegetarian options available. Quick service even though the line up was long."}
{"text":"Have been to konjiki for few times. I love their clam broth ramen (both shoyu and mild). Once my friend and I ordered the same Shoyu clam ramen but my soup tasted saltier. Not too sure if they put more soy sauce in my ramen. But other than that, I still enjoy eating their ramen. Come around 11:30ish when they just open and no need to wait in line."}
{"text":"One word: AMAZING!!! I came here with a friend on the first day it opened and from outside it looked like there weren't that many people but then when we opened the door, there was a queue of people right there. Someone came by us and wrote our names down, along with how many people. There was approximately 20 people infront of us and we waited for an hour. It was fine for me because I was talking to my friend. The dining area was really small and they really tried to maximize occupancy. Depending on where you are sitting, service would be a hassle. Besides that, I got the spicy red tonkotsu ramen and oh my goodness....I've never had something like that before. With the egg add-on, it was 100% worth it. I enjoyed every single spoonful and that I can say it left me with a really memorable taste. In the left side of the store, they also have a cafe, which I find a genius idea as people eating ramen who are not full to enjoy Japanese desserts right after. With two stores in one, it was hard to move around but the food experience was worth it!!"}
{"text":"Total wait time to get a table for us, was just under 1 hour.  According to Google wait time was only supposed to be less than 15 minutes.  So NEVER trust Google for wait time estimates.  But to speed things up, they hand you the menu while you are in line so you can order right away when you are seated.  From ordering to getting the food, it was SUPER fast.  The hubby took off his jacket, and went to the washroom, and our ramen arrived at the table before he even came back! We ordered their signature clam broth shio ramen, original shoyu tonkotsu ramen, and a side of braised pork belly.  Starting off with the broths.  Both the clam broth, and the tonkotsu broths are VERY different from any of the other ramen houses in Toronto.  The clam broth, very light and clear, strong truffle and clam flavours.  Nothing like I've ever tasted in a ramen broth before.  Delicious.  The tonkotsu broth, exact opposite of the clam broth, beautiful creamy pork broth that coats your mouth and doesn't seem to go away.  While being creamy, it didn't feel heavy.  I know it's a sign of respect and that you enjoyed your meal by finishing your broth.  Usually I don't.  But this time, I drank it all down!  Noodles, also different than the ramen houses in Toronto.  The only other time I've had ramen noodles like this was in North America was in New York City at Mr. Taka Ramen (sister restaurant to Bigiya in Tokyo which is also on Michelin's Bib Gourmand list).  The noodles are thinner, more al dente, and I would say more similar to a pasta than the ramen noodles that i'm used to eating.  All of their meats are done sous vide.  While the meat was tender, it felt a bit dry.  I assume because the chashu was made with a leaner cut of pork.  There was a thin strip of fat, but other than that, the chashu was very lean.  The pork belly, had some strips of fat running through it, and it was definitely a bit more juicy than the chashu, but there was a bit of gristle so some bites were a bit chewier.  I guess I'm just not a fan of the sous vide method.  The braised pork belly also came with an egg.  Presentation of the egg was flat out horrible looking.  I can't figure out how they cut it to look the way it did.  And it was also missing chunks of white too.  Usually when you can't peel the shell away from a boiled egg properly, either they did it too hot, or the egg wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to Ramen places in NYC and Toronto.   I came here with my friend returning from Paris. She has worked at a few michellin restaurants (non ramen). We both enjoyed our experience here.   The Tonkotsu broth ramen:  I did not get that wow punch I've gotten from other places. So it did not wow me. I could taste that it's very refined and different from other places (perhaps this place uses all natural ingredients)? Ramen was on the smaller size but the price is reasonable.  Decor: Minimal decor, it's darker with ambient light in a cozy seating area.   Service: Service is rushed they seem like they want you in and out of the place quickly. I think the place could be better run to accommodate the fans that line up. I wish the manager would contact me.  This is a unique place for its food and I'm glad Toronto has a new gem."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype and everything... it's just an average ramen place... I feel like they put a lot of MSG in it cuz I got so thirsty after eating it. Mediocre taste, over-priced compared to other ramen places in To."}
{"text":"I, like most others, came here because of its Michelin association. I didn't do my research and found out only recently that the restaurant is not Michelin rated itself - it just belongs to a brand that is. I tried both the mild and intense ramens that are their signature, and while they were good they were not amazing. I have had better clam broth in Japan, though I guess it would be unfair to compare. I actually think the mild/intense labelling is a bit misleading, because the flavours are different. The mild one is anchovy based while the intense one has a shoyu base so I found the mild one had a stronger flavour profile. The pork is very tender and soft, which was nice and different but some people prefer a slight char to their pork. Overall a good experience but I'm glad I didn't have to line up too long for it!"}
{"text":"I visited Konjiki last night for their Lobster Ramen, and this is how I would break it down:  Service: 3 During my stay there, I felt rushed. It was the first time my friend visited Konjiki, so I was explaining the menu to my friend and during the whole time, the male waiter kept just standing behind me waiting for us to order. And this was a couple minutes after we were seated. Then finally when I was about to recommend the dishes I ate, the waiter cut me off and asked us what ramen we wanted to order. I found that to be pretty rude since we were in the middle of our conversation to decide what to get.  Food: 4.5 The lobster meat was much bigger than I expected. And their Lobster miso/gut (I believe they call it the lobster cream reduction to make it sound more appealing) was pretty good. Some may find it to be fishy but it was the perfect amount for the western audience since it was not overwhelming (I personally prefer way more of it :P). The noodles were very chewy and tasty as always, and negi/onion complimented the miso flavour and lobster very well. I didn't understand how the peppers played a role in the soup so I'm guessing it was for the presentation.  Cost Performance: 4 It's definitely not something I can order often. It is pricy and their portions are small. I can honestly eat two of those and still have room for an appetizer and dessert. However, I think they did a decent job considering the amount of lobster and time they spent making the soup.   Comments/Suggestions: I find their portion to be too small for all their ramen. And the fact that they do not have an option to add more noodles disappoint me. And as a garlic lover, I wish they had a grated garlic option like some other ramen places do.  On the Lobster Ramen menu, they listed that they recommend people getting rice in the end to mix is your the broth which I totally agree. HOWEVER, the ramen size is very small in general, and there is not a lot of soup left once you finish eating the noodles! I wish they added more soup if they recommend people getting the rice."}
{"text":"I am excited that a Michelin Bib Gourmand Ramen Joint from Tokyo decided to open their first oversea outpost in North York!   I came here with no expectation but Konjiki Ramen did not disappoint. You can tell the attention of details in the preparation, the use of ingredients and even the presentations.  Signature Shoyu Clam Broth ($14) is aromatic with a touch of truffle oil. Sous-vide pork is tender and moist. Noodle cooked al dente with a great chewiness. Portion wise is perfect and leave me room for dessert at Saryo Cafe.  If you come by off peak, there is not much of a wait time. And definitely worth trying. If you are a lobster lover, don't miss their Lobster Ramen ($28) on Wednesday.  Service is friendly and attentive. Just like the ramen joint in Japan."}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:25, just before it opened for lunch, and got a seat right away. It was full by noon but the line wasn't that bad when we left. We had the intense shoyu clam broth and the spicy red tonkotsu, along with the chicken karaage and pork chashu don on the side.This is one of the better bowls of ramen I've had in the city. The shoyu clam broth was delicate, the noodles were springy and I liked the freshness of the shaved onion on top. My one tiny criticism would be that I've had more flavourful chashu but this did not detract in any meaningful way. The spicy tonkotsu packed a punch but was not overwhelmingly spicy. I got a hint of cumin (I think) which was unusual, but good.  The sides were very large portions for the price. the fried chicken was well cooked and very juicy. Overall, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"After ALLL the hype around this ramen joint, a few friends and I decided to line up to visit Konjiki ramen on their second opening day. We went approx 15 min before their opening hours, and we were able to get seats at the bar easily.  Walking in, Saryo situates at the front, which is a desert house. The ramen shop sits at the back, with 8-9 tables and a circular bar in the middle. Design is modern with hints of wood finishing, very simple and clean.   After quickly browsing through the menu, I decided on the spicy tonkotsu ramen, while my friends ordered their house special clam broth and smoky black tonkotsu. Together we shared the gyoza (which was quite good, portion wise slightly small but I really liked the fillings.) Upon receiving my bowl of ramen, I was disappointed that it did not come with much toppings. I didnt realize that eggs and chashu was extra. However, that disappointment dissolved quickly as I took a sip of the broth. It was very rich and creamy, but not overpoweringly greasy with a heap of spicy ground beef right on top. The spiciness was mellow at first, but built up quite a bit as I ate. One thing to note is that they make all their noodles in house, and to be honest, it was probably the best part of the entire meal. I loved the chewy al dente texture of the noodles, it paired extremely well with the broth. The handcrafted noodles were coated with broth, making every bite flavorful and delicious. However towards the end it was a little to salty for my liking. We finished the meal with some desserts from Saryo. How can we resist after having to walk by it on the way out? Such sneaky design by the owner. We ordered Hojicha soft serve and their matcha sundae parfait. I loved the soft serve, its creamy and the flavor is more noticeable than say tsujiri or other dessert shops.  I would recommend this place for any ramen lover, but be prepared to pay for extra toppings - or be disappointed like me. Its worth a visit as long as the line ups arent out the door."}
{"text":"If you are tired of the same tonkotsu ramen that has been popping up in every city, this is the place for you to excite you're taste buds. Using a combination of clams, pork, and chicken, the signature broth packs a delicious flavor bomb in both the shoyu and shio versions. The addition of the truffle oil further adds to the already unique flavor of the broth.   As for noodles, they are more similar to soba noodles than your typical ramen noodles. The bowls come with marinated bamboo shoots and two slices of sous vide pork tenderloin chasu. Addition of the marinated soft boil egg and pork belly will run your bill to around $20 CAD before tax.   Although pricey, I think this is definitely one of the more unique offerings in the Toronto area. Glad to have tried it!"}
{"text":"Flavorful ramen soups with elevated ingredients. I like this place, but I prefer Kinton. It's more down to earth."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Konjiki Ramen, but it did not impress. This is not a Michelin star restaurant, nor is it a great Michelin Bib recommendation.   My vegetarian ramen ($14) was room temperature. Tofu nugget was cold. Roasted corn was cold. The vegetarian ramen bowl itself is visually appealing. With that being said, the soy milk and potato broth was bland. Yam tastes under cooked. Spinach served no purpose in terms of flavour for the bowl. It could be the way it was executed that day; however, I did not feel like any of the components build on each other.   Everyone at our table agree that it was not worth the price tag or the wait. I would not recommend Konjiki Ramen."}
{"text":"I was completely shattered after driving 30 min to get to this joint for the sole purpose of trying Tonkotsu Ramen. If you are like me, avoid going here on Wednesdays. Having said that I'm actually glad they didn't have it because I tried their shoyu ramen instead and was blown away by the complexity of soup and depth of flavor.  Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"East Meets West; An Artistic Ramen  It's been a while since I've written for Yelp, but it's worth sharing when good food is so inspiring that one wants write about it.  This is how I feel about Konjiki Ramen; it's worth sharing. Note I had the Shio ramen and the pork belly.  Chef Yamamoto has done something very interesting with ramen, a very fusion of French and Japanese cooking styles and I daresay it has paid off immensely.  If I were to describe the Shio Ramen is a painting with many layers of paint to become a masterpiece.   Using the signature deep flavoured clam broth as a foundation, Chef Yamamoto, it provides a refreshing and unique taste that serves as a base to everything that comes after.  The base is strong but doesn't overpower or linger allowing for a lot of gentle flavours to come through.  This method of nuanced flavors allow for a complex layering effect providing an interesting harmony when you mix what you eat.  For example, the white truffle oil and the porcini puree becomes a very fleeting flavor that only appears as you eat the noodles but does not come out when you drink the soup.  The chashu, cooked sous vide, is not only tender and has a delicate marinate that permeates throughout each bit.  Truly delicious though sliced a little thin and very few pieces.  If I were to make a comment though, I feel like the noodle has taken a backseat and became more of a vehicle in transporting the truffle flavour which overshadows it.  As I'm sitting here writing this review I honestly cannot remember any special characteristics of the noodle.  Whether it is a good thing or not, I'll leave it up to the reader to decide.  The pork belly was, I believe, cooked sous vide as well.  Every slice was consistently cooked to perfection but not \"finished\" (torch seared).  Each one very flavourful.  If you feel like the belly is a little too greasy or heavy, one can use the mustard-horseradish(/wasabi) sauce to cut the grease and enhance the taste.  It came with the usual ramen eggs, nothing particular outstanding I can think of.  All in all, Chef Yamamoto has done something very interesting with his ramen and I can see his philosophy of chasing that perfect bowl as written on the wall of the shop by adapting different culture, cooking techniques and ingredients to make something special.  Furthermore, I feel that Toronto's diversity will be a suitable battleground for him to grow and improve. I will look forward to his future creations."}
{"text":"First off, the karaage here is fantastic. Second, the spicy red tonkotsu ramen was pretty good too although I don't think it's the #1 ramen in the city. It was very creamy and spicy, which I prefer. My wife got the mild signature clam broth ramen, which I thought wasn't creamy or flavourful enough. Also, I was a bit surprised by pork belly add on that I got. I ordered it at the recommendation of the waitress because she said the bowl didn't have any meat in it (it actually does). However, the pork belly ended up almost cold in temperature when I first tasted it. Dunking it deep into the broth for a few minutes made it room temperature."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of ramen and I've been to many great ones, however this was exceptional good! Their signature clam broth ramen was so flavorful, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with how unique Konjiki Ramen is. Just upon arriving, I am greeted with such a smiling crowd of wait staff who explain the menu SO passionately and their love for the restaurant is just SO contagious and now I am rambling but my dining experience was just really really positive.  I orderd the Clam Ramen Shio (Light). It came with clam broth, garnishes, chashu, and bamboo shoots.  The clam broth really blew me away. Think a lighter version of Clam chowder. They say they cook the clam for at least 6 hours for the broth flavour and I really do trust it. The garnish and truffle oil that is added really elevate the flavours too.   The noodles are pretty thin, so the broth adheres to the noodle really well. They are not too firm but not too soft either.  They give you two slices of Chashu that are cooked PERFECTLY. Super tender - I had a dentist appointment beforehand and had no problem at all biting through the meat.   A few minor complaints... remember the meat ramens don't come with Egg! Because I forgot, they just gave me the egg on the side (since I already started eatng), which was slightly cold and overcooked (the egg wasn't runny and was slightly well done around the edges) (probably because it's been in the fridge for a bit). The flavour of the egg was still good, but I can imagine it being a lot better if it came prepared with the ramen instead of on the side.  Overall, would definitely come back for the clam ramen :D"}
{"text":"So I am updating my review since konjiki went out of their way to include the veggie ramen now as an everyday menu item.  To be honest I really enjoyed the ramen noodle.  It gets softer the more you eat it and my whole family enjoyed their ramen as well.  The staff is also attentive.  Thank you Konjiki for going above and beyond and making our experience a great one."}
{"text":"Still bomb ramen despite the wait! We waited about 40 minutes for 5 people and got a seat around the high tops which was good for us to communicate still.  My company loved what they ordered."}
{"text":"Not living up to the hype.   Visited this ramen restaurant and tried the Shio clam broth ramen. My friend got the Shoyu one. The shio was better but I wouldn't wait in line for it.   The shoyu clam broth ramen was too strong and the shoyu masked all the clam flavour. We both didn't like the shoyu.  The shio clam broth ramen was lighter and you can taste the clam flavour more. The soup base was ok but nothing over the top that we expected. It would've been better if the clam flavour was stronger. As for the ramen, the ramen noodles were nicely made. They was nice and chewy. As for the meat. Portion was small  and we both did not like the chashu. It was soft, kinda dry but not dry. It's just really weird to explain. But did not meet our liking. On the other hand the egg was flavourless. Just tasted like a plain boiled egg.   As for service, service was non existent. The waiter was never around and so difficult to find. Never came around to check up on us.   Overall, food was Mediocre. Not worth it if there's a wait. Service was horrible. Not what you expect from all the hype and the fact that the restaurant is an Michelin recommended one.   Very disappointing. Kinton Ramen is down the street if you want better food and faster service."}
{"text":"There was a 30 min wait, but that was expected. The ramen was delicious - definitely richer and tastier than any other tonkotsu broth I've had in toronto. It was also not too salty, as i find with many ramen dishes. My only complaint is the lack of tables for groups. They have really poor utilization of space - a huge bar-like table in the middle for individuals. Due to this my party of three had to sit beside each other and couldn't really have a conversation. I guess they want you to eat quickly and have a faster turnover? Not the best dining experience but go for the taste???"}
{"text":"Still needs a lot of improvement in terms of efficiency and organization. Went today around 1:15pm and waited for about 25-30 minutes until we were seated. We could have been seated earlier as there were tons of empty space but it took so long for any of the services to clean up and seat people in line. I was literally staring at 6 empty seats for a good 5-10 minutes.  Our experience was further dampened when they sat us down at a table for 2 and then asked us to move to the bar stools a few minutes later. They just told us that the seat was meant for someone else even though we were next in line. Clearly, the table of 2 beside us were finishing up and they had wanted to merge the tables to accommodate for a group of four. We were fine with moving but they were so disorganized, they could have cleaned up the other area before asking us to move. But instead, we had to awkwardly stand around in front of the line again cause it took another 5 minutes for us to be seated in unpreoccupied bar stool seats.   My boyfriend ordered the signature shoyu and I got smoky black tonkotsu so we could compare broth quality. Our food came out really quickly and to be frank, didn't think it was worth the wait. The ramen was kind of salty and didn't really have the umami taste I was expecting. Both the broths seem to lack a depth of flavour that gives it any wow factor, but it was still tasty.   The braised pork belly was exceptionally tender and worth adding to your bowl for $3 (3pcs)! However, I was so utterly disappointed by the tamago - it's like cutting into an eggs Benedict and finding out the yolk is cooked. The inside wasn't runny and has a weird pasty consistency (as seen in my picture).   Ramen tasted fine but nothing spectacular. Probably won't return for a while given our experience, would rather line up for Sansotei.  + I hate food that leaves me so thirsty and wanting to drink 3-5 glasses of water."}
{"text":"The line is pretty long to get in since there isn't a lot of seating, but I think it's worth the wait. I'm not a big fan of ramen but I decided to try this out anyways since it's cheaper than other Michelin star restaurants.. plus the fact that it has a Michelin star. My friend and I waited in line for about 45 minutes or so. This is in the same unit as a Japanese dessert place so I guess that's convenient if you get hangry and want a quick little bite to hold you till you get to the ramen.  They're known for their clam broth ramen (which I also highly recommend), but they also have tonkotsu and even a vegetarian option (which I thought was nice). I figured I wouldnt be able to find the clam broth ramen elsewhere so decided to order the shio version (milder).  This place has changed my opinion on ramen. I honestly thought I didn't like ramen because I've visited the other very popular ramen places in Toronto, but I've never really been impressed by it. However, this was a game changer. The broth was full bodied and the noodles had the right amount of chewiness. I added an egg to mine (extra $1.50) and that was perfectly done. Usually my friend and I talk a bit during any of our food missions, but when we sat down for that bowl of ramen, we were both silent since we were enjoying it so much. The total came to about $20, which is pricey for ramen, but then again, cheap for a Michelin star item.   I live in GTA so I don't go to North York much. I might have to make an exception and venture up more often for this ramen though..."}
{"text":"This is an ok ramen place. I ordered the Tonkasu ramen, the broth was creamy and not overly salty, the ramen was good but the pork was small and mostly just fat. The portion is too small. There are better ramens I have been to. The price was around $13-14, I found it is a bit expensive for the snack portion of food. I could pay for less and have a full meal in a nearby restaurant. The service wasn't great but understandable as they were busy.  Additional tip, if you get seated in the middle area, you could only hang your coat under the table. So don't wear your long Canada goose jacket there or you will have to wear it the whole time while eating."}
{"text":"Konjiki Ramen - rated as #1 for ramen in Tokyo for the last two years and making onto the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for the past four years - has opened its first overseas location in Toronto.\"Concept Ramen\" which blends traditional Japanese flavours with fresh local ingredients is what is served here. We ended up trying the Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen and the Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen.  The Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen ($13) was my favourite. The ramen is handmade in-house daily. It is a little thinner than I am used to but still of great quality with just the right amount of chewiness and bounce. The pork bone soup was rich with a deep smokey flavour and not overly salty with small bits of smoked pork hidden in the broth. I was impressed with the small charred tomatoes which added a pop of sweetness and also really upped the smokiness factor. Not being a huge fan of bamboo shoots, I was surprised how much I liked the ones here. These red wine braised bamboo shoots were firm yet tender and slightly sweet in flavour.  The Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen ($14) was also delicious. The clam, pork, and chicken soup was flavourful yet light enough so that you can taste the truffle sauce in the soup. The sous vide chashu was very lean and tender.  Overall, the ramen was extremely tasty and satisfying. The only complaint I have is the cost-value factor. At $13-$14 a bowl, I was hoping to have more than three pieces of thin chashu and a little more toppings in both the bowls. Nonetheless, what was there was very good.  Chef Atsushi Yamasmoto will be overseeing the Toronto restaurant for the next two months so come by and check it out while the master is in the house!"}
{"text":"Attended during soft launch opening - lunch hour. Not a huge fan of the vegetarian creamy ramen - the broth is soy milk based, and much too overbearing in taste. Maybe it's an acquired taste. Regardless, I couldn't overcome the taste of soy milk with my ramen, and wouldn't recommend trying it. The dish also doesn't look appetizing - broth is white with a layer of oil on top. Compared to other ramen shops, I also noticed that they aren't as generous with their toppings. I did order an egg as an add-on for my meal."}
{"text":"Part of my restaurant hopping night, this is the second. They serve limited items, I had the signature shoyu clam broth ramen, pork belly and their fried chicken. Place isn't as crowded as I thought, but had limited seating. The clam broth was a bit on the salty side, the pork makes me feel like I'm going on a diet. But do get pork belly, it's the redemption. My friend had the black tonkotsu ramen, the broth was better. Will I come back? Yes, but I will probably try something else first."}
{"text":"The line up was not too long, approx 20 mins. The staff were friendly. The food was good but not amazing. We paid extra for the egg add-on but the egg was over cooked for ramen. There were a good amount of noodles in the bowl. The meat was sous vide which was nice and tender. However I prefer the nice fatty meat that comes with ramen at other places. Also I am used to choosing the thickness of my noodles. The service was quite fast once we sat down. We were in and out within 30 mins after sitting. I would return to try the spicy ramen if there were no line ups."}
{"text":"Ordered the shio clam broth soup and the tonkatsu ramen. The broth was amazing for both. Loved the creaminess of the tonkatsu broth. The shio clam broth was flavorful and not oily/thick. Definitely my fav ramen spot in Toronto"}
{"text":"For what was advertised as a Michelan Star ramen, this place is way behind!  Everything was absolutely tasteless, their signature ramen has no flavour at all, the noodle is good but not spectacular, the pork meat again, tasteless. We also ordered a guioza portion and the fried chicken that were ok.  I think there are much better places for Ramen in Toronto without 2h line."}
{"text":"Their intense flavour ramen is how I'd imagine it's like chewing 5 gum.  I wouldn't know though, since I'm vegan.  5 out of 5 gums."}
{"text":"Tokyo Michelin recommended? Yes! This is probably one of the most comparable ramen places to the ones in Tokyo (actually gave me the feeling I was eating ramen in Japan). The broth was what made it complete. The noodles were average, nothing too special. Despite that, I'd still rate it full stars only because there really isn't any other ramen places in Toronto I'd rave about. Attempted to come here once on the weekend and they said it would be a one hour wait. Came back another time on a weekday during lunch with only a 5 minute wait. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This ramen place is the Toronto location of the japan's Michelin 1 star restaurant. The Toronto location opened a fee months ago. And there is usually a long line up. Got there around 230 and the wait wasn't bad. (about 10 minutes). The menu is not extensive. A few ramen with some sides.  I tried the signature clam broth ramen with a side order of pork belly and seasoned egg. The presentation was very nice. The broth was exceptional. The clam made a big difference in the taste. Definitely tasty and unique. The ramen was  good and served with a couple slices of pork belly and shredded scallions. Overall tasty. Surprisingly the side order pork belly was not as good. It was thicker cut but also tasted drier. I wouldn't mind going again to try another ramen but I would not want to line up for it. The food is 4 star but the service was ok. (didn't get water until we asked for it 3 times) on top of the long line up, I would agree with the 3.5 statement rating.  Incidentally there is a dessert shop in the ramen place. It does have amazing matcha ice cream dessert. I would give that 5 star"}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen with very friendly staff, a unique ambiance, and even a dessert counter.  I ordered the Signature Clam Broth Shoyu ramen which was very enjoyable. The broth was light but rich (and not too salty thankfully), while the thin noodles were soft yet filling. Surprisingly, the pork was very different from what I usually have at other ramen places. One would expect the thinly sliced, slightly charred pork chasiu belly or shoulder, however, Konjiki's was a light pink color with more meat and less fat ratio, and of course, without that charring.   As for the ambiance and furnishings, I really liked the table setup of the place. At the center is a rectangular-shaped high table with stools for \"eat-and-dash\" customers to sit side by side while admiring the beautiful centerpiece orchids. Meanwhile, standard four-seater tables line both sides of the restaurant.   Lastly, of all ramen places I've been to so far, I believe Konjiki is the only one with a dessert counter where one can buy tasty treats. I didn't get a chance to browse through them as I was in a hurry to leave but will it out next time. However, I do wonder whether that space could have been better utilized to fit more tables instead. Just a thought."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a hot bowl of ramen in subzero weather. Despite the many ramen joints in Toronto, Konjiki stands out for being a Michelin star Japanese import known for its clam based broth. But does it live up to the hype?   It's hard to miss this place even if you've never been to North York. Mostly because there's usually a line out of it at all hours. When we arrived on Saturday around 1pm, we were told the wait would be around 40 minutes to an hour (Tip: you have to put your name on the waitlist, and the waitress may or may not come outside to tell you if your table is ready).   Luckily it was worth the wait. The interior resembled more of a bar than your typical ramen place: there was a large communal table for solo diners and a few tables along the side for groups. It was crowded, with servers running around but overall things ran very efficiently.   I tried the Shio signature clam broth while my friend had the Shoyu which has a heavier soy sauce base. Upon the first sip I already fell in love with the light broth. It was unlike any other ramen broth I've ever had, at once light and savoury, tasting distinctly like the sea. Although their broth also uses the usual ingredients like pork and chicken, what you taste immediately is the clam. It was light and savoury, not bland at all while the shoyu was more on the heavy side (so it really depends on your taste).   You can really tell that each bowl of ramen is made with a lot of love and care. All of the ingredients used like the bamboo shoots, mushrooms, chasu, and truffle oil really work together beautifully to create a great bowl of ramen. There have been complaints that the portion is too small but I found it comparable to most other places and was full when I finished.   I think out of all the ramen places in Toronto, Sansotei is still my favorite but I would definitely come back to Konjiki once the hype dies down for their clam broth again and to try their take on Tonkatsu.   Oh, by the way, egg is extra so make sure to ask for it when you order!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed. We arrived maybe around 8:30 and didn't get seated until 9. There isn't much room for waiting. It's a small thin hallway which gets crowded quickly. Some people even had to wait outside when the line got too long.   Once we were seated, everything was fantastic. The place has a good vibe although seating is a bit odd. The restaurant is small so the whole middle is where they placed a long rectangular table and seats all around. They use this as their bar section. There are other tables around the outside of that but not very many. If you come here with a big group you may have to wait a while to get one of the booths which were very limited. The server was quick to take our orders and the food arrived very shortly afterwards.  We ordered the Shoyu and the Shio Signature Clam Broth Ramen. The broth for both dishes are very tasty. They come with tender pork and more than enough noodles. Only down side is none of the ramen dishes come with the hard boiled egg. You have to order it as an add on for an extra cost. The ramen had me craving it for days afterwards. Will definitely be heading back here soon."}
