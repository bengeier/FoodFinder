{"text":"Had brunch here Sunday with a friend. The meal was very good. I mean the options were limited but over all a solid brunch! I've only come to Brewsters on one other occasion so I can't speak to the service before as it was at another location in Calgary. The place wasn't busy. The staff was rather slow but the food was good so no complaints on that.

I had the southwestern omelette and I LOVED the salsa inside it was so yummy and really added a nice touch to the meal. Prices were also fair. I decided to branch out from my usual egg benny. It was a nice change."}
{"text":"The solution, I have discovered, to inconsistent table service is to sit at the wood. Bartenders are right there and they do a good job of looking after there immediate patrons. This isn't great for more than 4, but if you get a corner then it works perfectly for visiting (bar vet tip - you're welcome!).

The food seems to be more consistent than a while ago, so I have no complaints there. Wings are good and a good deal during Flames games.Pretzel and spud skins are also good appies.

Brewster's is known for their own brews: some awesome and some not so much. Usually a new seasonal flavour to try as well. There is a selection of bottle beers if the Brewster brew is not your taste at all.However, they have made a decision to make Flying Frog (my fave) a seasonal brew to which I say \"Boooooooo!\" Hammerhead ale is good. Couple of my Swill-Mates  love the peach and raspberry topped with same fruit.

The patio is awesome when it is open."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here frequently, probably 2 times per month at least. Very hit and miss, the food will be amazing one visit, and lacking the next. We order the same thing (creatures of habit and preference) so we notice the difference. 
We've also had really terrible service, including this weeks visit on Thursday. 30 minutes to take our drink order and twenty more to bring a refill? 

If there was another Brewsters within comparable distance, we would likely go there, instead. I really like their beer though; they never seem to completely disappoint me in that regard."}
{"text":"After going to Brewster's on a number of various occasions, it has needlessly become one of my more favourite places to go to.  Although there are a number of different Brewster's locations in Calgary, this particular one is great for the \"far\" north west dwellers of the city.  Located in Crowfoot, this is an ideal place to go where tons of parking is available, and places like Chapters, coffee shops, and the movie theater is within walking distance.  Whether you are choosing to have a girls/guys night out, or want to have a quiet intimate dinner, this place is suitable for all occasions.

Upon walking in, you have the choice to either sit in the dining area or lounge - both sections are comfortable, warm, and relaxing where an array of televisions are on display and tuned to the sports.
With a great selection to a number of different beers, pints, shakers, and schooners are all at reasonable pricing.  Definitely try the Raspberry ale and blueberry ale if you like brews with a fruity twist.

Depending on how much you want to spend, the food is also at reasonable pricing where entrees and main dishes range from around $10 to $20.  However I'm a teensy eater and usually have a difficult time finishing my meal - so for me I usually get my money's worth.  Because I'm a lactose-ovo vegetarian, the selection is a little limited to salads, flatbreads, and veggie burgers (which I always find really yummy!) - so if you're in this situation, do ask the server as they do accommodate.  For those that like pub classics or enjoy trying different things on the menu, Brewster's offers a great selection of appetizers, burgers, wraps, and dishes with fish, etc, etc.   It's a little off tangent, but I do give heads up to people who plan on ordering the mac & cheese.  Unless you're a huge cheese lover fan - you may not enjoy it where it is quite rich and very cheesy."}
{"text":"Decent food, beef tacos and the soup were excellent. The chicken wings were pretty small, not a lot of meat on them at all. You get a pound and it's probably 60% bone. It nice and spacious inside and they have a walled off patio to help cut down the traffic noise.  The beers are pretty average however. I'm always skeptical when the brewery explicitly brew beers that hit a specific alcohol content (5%), having said that, Gunther's Hef and the London Porter were pretty good. Normally I'd give a place like this 3 stars, but the atmosphere and the wait staff are top notch. Solid 4 stars. If you care more about the beers, hit up Wild Rose..."}
{"text":"We are not happy with waitress since we are waiting for order our foods and waste my time. I hope this resturant need improve and on time for order foods"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of lunches at Brewsters on 11th for years, but until recently, I wasn't aware the McKenzie Towne location even existed. 
 
We happened upon it completely by accident (a wrong turn into McKenzie Towne from Deerfoot)...  but once we spotted the rooftop patio --on a picture perfect summer evening--a change in plans immediately took place!

We found a spot amidst the BUSY parking lot, and headed straight for the roof.
 
Upon arrival, the hostess asked if we wanted to be seated at a couch, or a table.
 
A couch?  

Yup - the patio is scattered with optional L-shaped sectionals and \"coffee tables.\"  

The couches DID look pretty appealing to kick back  in the sun with some cold ones and a group of friends.   

However, we were ordering full meals, so opted for a table.  (a quick doing-the-math-in-my-head-calculation said:  I've sat on the couch eating and watching TV at home enough times to know, \"I could be wearing dinner on my pants.  That would look bad\").  

But I digress.
   
A few things noteworthy about the patio itself:  It was buzzing pretty good on this sunny evening, even though it was a weekday.

Physically it's a pretty large area, and I don't think anyone was choosing the lower level restaurant (which looked to be pretty huge, actually).  And why would you, when the weather is nice?  Both weather options covered here.

A pleasant evening ensued... and didn't end, because the moment the air started to cool after sundown, they kicked in the overhead heaters to keep the \"sun on your face\" feeling alive all evening long.

The food?

The nightly specials are decent:  Schooners and steak sandwiches on this day.  But I went for the Maui burger for nostalgic reasons (loved grilled pineapple in Maui)!  And I must say, the pub fare was well above average, as it is most of the time at Brewsters.  Truthfully, it was one of the more satisfying burgers I've had in a while.

Yeah McKenzie town is pretty out of the way for most of us (unless you actually LIVE there).  But passing by on Deerfoot, it's a patio well worth checking out on sunny evening."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant a handful of times and have never been disappointed but also never blown away with their food. I will refer to our most recent visit....my husband had a spicy pizza which he devoured without complaint and I ordered the meatloaf Mac and cheese....it was really nice. I would return for this dish. The rest of the menu is a great if you are ok with a variation of the traditional dishes that are normally offered....I like mainstream but that is just me! The service was VERY slow... Not impressed. It was a Thursday night and there was no excuse other than being understaffed. It is very dark so bring your flashlight to read the menu. The patio in the summer is awesome......I definitely recommend coming then! All in all, I would drop in for a beer and wings with friends, maybe not a place to take people to impress :)"}
{"text":"This place is exactly a 'meh' sort of place.

My bf works in the area and we decided on a lunch date there, we came in at about 12:45/12:50 so right at the end of the lunch rush.

We were seated right away but then the slow service started... and continued.... maybe the server thought that we weren't in a rush, but the place had max 8 tables in there. I saw numerous waitresses. Yet, it still took us forever to get in and out. The food took ages to come and then even when we were done (we ate fast) she never came to check on us and we sat there with our empty plates in front of us for ages, at least 10/15 minutes until she finally came and we asked for our bill. For a lunch place in an industrial area, they should be more aware of timing expecially at 12:45/1pm on a Thursday. The service was unacceptably slow and there was no apology or reason for it, just seemed lazy.

The food was fine, maybe even good, but service makes or breaks it usually. The interior of the place is cold feeling, big, open, hard, and not very inviting."}
{"text":"Pretty dissapointing for Sat afternoon seems to be the same service on Sat we have been multiple times because of proximity only. 
 It was wing day so we started with wings, honey garlic they were really good and quite large it just took a long time to arrive. We placed our food order after the appitizer was done because the server kept dissapearing. It seemed like there was alot of servers on we just didn't get a good one. 
 This was the first time we ordered meals we usually just go for wings and again not very impressed for the price. I feel if I'm paying fourteen dollars for a burger it should not be a frozen patty. All around bad will not be returning. Calgary has so many other choices.
Sorry Brewsters....NEXT!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised Brewsters has gotten so many reviews as we really like the place, handy walk from our house (about 10 minutes) and in the summer they have what I think is one of the best rooftop patios in the city with great lounging couches, lots of plants etc. Don't each much here and the complaints seem to be about the food so that may be the problem. From what I can remember I've had burgers, wings, nachos. I do steer away eating in places where the menu states \"x, cooked to perfection\" - does that mean the rest of the menu isn't?? Just one of my pet peeves. Great place for a beer, always busy. Used to always go to the Kilt and Kaber but you'll have to read that review so see why not."}
{"text":"We live a 10 minute walk/stagger (depending on direction) from Brewster's and enjoy it on at least a monthly basis. Haven't had much luck with the food apart from the great greasy hangover burgers on the upstairs patio on a Sunday morning but the ambience is great, beer is good, service is generally very friendly and attentive and they have IMHO one of the best patios (rooftop) in the city."}
{"text":"With over a dozen types of their own specialty beer, like a raspberry ale with raspberries floating in it,  Brewsters offers a change from the tired old beer and a meal menu. Their small-batch-brewed beers are actually quite good and come with meal suggestions.
I had their brown ale with the meatloaf. That made for an appetizing combination. Nothing was too expensive on the menu and having fresh, clean beer is a nice change from having to suck back skunky Molson draught with a steak sandwich.
I can't wait to get back there and try a few more of their beer and meal combinations."}
{"text":"Great food n beer! I've been going to Brewsters Foothills for 8+ years, don't think I'll stop!!"}
{"text":"I strongly believe Brewsters Foothills is a one of the best bang for your buck, if you're into Wings, Craft Beer, and overall great service. They have their own specials going on and the beer is slightly cheaper than the other Brewsters (because they are brewing there). I always find different seasonals to try, their staff is nice, the place looks fabulous, although looking at it from the street, you would not believe there is such a place in an industrial park! Crowd is diverse, from pipefitters to men in ties. It deserves more recognition! I love this place as I'm a regular. You'd be a regular too if you like beer and great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Why, oh why do I keep going?  No more.  I promise this time.  It has been MONTHS since I last went to Brewster's Crowfoot.  The last time I went, I was aggravated  by watching the servers/management flirt with each other, while I and the rest of the busy, although not crowded, restaurant went unattended.  Today, I thought I'd try it again.  We went around 130pm for lunch.  Was ignored for about ten minutes.  Finally the waitress came over. (Why are there so many staff wandering the floor but only 1 person is taking orders?)  Anyways, was served my beer (which IS always good there), and had some slopped onto me.  No biggie, spills happen, but waitress did not return to clean it up after she said she would.  Then food arrived....meh....and the sauce for my sandwich was ALSO slopped all over my plate, making my salad HOT.  No refills offered, and other than \"how are the first bites\", no one checked on us.  Forty dollars later for a mediocre lunch.  Even though beer is always good and cold, there are other places to get this need met.  I'm not going again.  Worth the extra few minutes drive to Royal Oak where LOTS of other food businesses are thriving.  Goodbye Brewster's.  It's not me, it's you."}
{"text":"To Review/Rate a place like this is very very simple!

Service is Great, Friendly know the menu's and drinks!

Drinks are amazing....just that bloody nice

Food, well this is where you put the menu down and just ask if you can shoot down the road to timmies and grab a box of donuts to bring in.

Food sucks here, if you order anything that is fried and trust me if you order the platter...your gonna get fried food. Then when you order your drinks just ask the server to brink a roll of Bounty cause the oil will drip off the food. Me and my mate finished the platter and on the plate was nothing but oil...i thought if i could get to female servers i could get them to stang on the over sized plate and doing a little oil wrestling...IT WAS THAT BAD!

but the drinks were good!"}
{"text":"Clean place, music , a little loud to sit and have a conversation. Ladies are pretty, service was acceptable, food was okay. Had chicken Caesar salad. Chicken was seasoned with some spice I didn't care for. Salad wasn't as much garlic as I was hoping for. I guess everyone around me this afternoon will appreciate it. Shannon was are server, very pretty, sweet girl. 

Would I go back? Probably, just not tomorrow."}
{"text":"They still need yo get tge servers up to speed and trained properly.  Definitely some of the worst in Calgary.  Having said that the food is usually pretty good.  The roof top patio is a hit!!!

The beer is always cold as well."}
{"text":"There aren't many restaurant options in the NW. I'm not an Earl's / Joey Tomatos / Keg hater, they're just a little \"mall-chain-dining\" for my (not so eclectic) tastes. Unfortunately when in suburbia I tend to do as the suburbanites and join the Friday and Saturday night hordes who make the Crowfoot Keg and Dalhousie Earl's look like a NewYork subway station in rush-hour. 

If you've never been, you have to see it to believe it -  it's absolutely crazy, people become transformed and belligerent, like an angry zombie horde, or a driver in the Beacon Hill \"Power Centre.\" 

Anyway, if I had the money, or more likely, if you have the money, please open up a place with a great beer and wine selection and hire a chef to make the kind of food that I'll gladly pay for, but don't want to drive halfway across the city for. 

Anyway, sorry for the digression - my wife and I found ourselves at Brewster's again. The service is very good here - so no complaints on that front.  My complaints have to do with the actual food and beverages available. The wine selection is limited and so is, actually, the beer selection. It's a brewpub, this is supposed to be what they do. In the states many great brewers begin as brewpubs and create demand for their fantastic product one pint at a time. 

As a beer lover, I can't get excited over Brewsters. I've tried them all and the only one that I'd give more than half-hearted praise to would be the Rig Pig pale ale, it's okay, although I'm not quite ready to agree with their description of  \"A hop lovers delight. Generous amounts of Cascade hops balance with Alberta malt...\" if you want generous hops, try some of the west coast IPAs then get back to me.

The food is pretty fair pub grub, again I can't get too worked up, though maybe at the price ($25.97 for nachos) I should.  Brewster's is just okay I somehow feel that for $77.61 for drinks and nachos it should be more than that."}
{"text":"It has been a very, very, long time since I was last at Brewsters.  My Husband and I thought we would pop in here for dinner.  There was a 20 minute wait for the dining room, so we found a table right away in the lounge.  Our server came promptly and brought us menus.  

They had their hammerhead ale on special for $5.25, so we both decided on a pint of that.  They have descriptions of their beers on the back of the menus.  I like the sampler tray idea, you get 5 different beers for $8.50.  While we waited for our drinks, we tried to take in the extensive menu they have!  I did not know what to try!  They have a maple curry penne that sounded very interesting.  They have a great variety of food!  Mediterranean tapas, mole quesa dip, dumplings, nachos for starts.  6 different salads, 5 different burgers, chicken and steak options, even meatloaf, pizzas, a few pastas, pub fair including wraps and sandwiches.  There are a lot of options!  

My Hubby and I decided we wanted to try the mole quesa dip, so I just got the thai chicken wrap and he got the applewood burger.  We waited about 20 minutes for our dip.  It was very good, topped with jalapenos, cheese, olives, tomatoes, served with chips.  After a bit it got kind of rich for me, but my Hubby had no trouble polishing it off!  Our food came about 15 minutes later.  My wrap was very good, the chicken crispy and all white meat.  The fries were crispy and hot.  My Hubby's burger was smothered in ketchup and didn't turn out to be all that great.  I took a bite and it was kinda blah.  Our server was very good about checking up on us, but wasn't in our face at all.  It seemed like the staff were all pretty friendly and efficient.  Our bill came to $55.

I was glad we gave Brewsters a try.  I was very pleased with my food and their beer was awesome!  I am looking forward to going back and trying something else!"}
{"text":"I love this place as the seating is well designed and the atmosphere is quiet enough to have a conversation without yelling! The food is usually very good as is the service. Today I had the short ribs which were very flavourful. The only complaint I have is with the vegetables. They were practically raw. Carrots and Broccolini should not be served hot but hard. They even tasted raw. Other than that it's what I expected and will still continue to frequent."}
{"text":"I completely forgot about this Brewster's until my boyfriend suggested to go here before we checked out a movie. Remembering our great experience at the Brewster's downtown I was totally for it.

We arrived right around dinner time, and considering it was Saturday I thought it was going to be busy but it wasn't. We got seated at a booth by the window and our server grabbed our drinks as we looked over the menu.

I decided to go with what I had last time (Chicken and Bacon Alfredo) and my boyfriend went off his usual path of burgers and got the beef dip.

My pasta was as delicious as I remembered, the beef dip wasn't great. We can't pin point what is was (not enough salt or the flavoring of the meat was off?) Although my boyfriend says a great beer saves any meal (he had the Blackberry Wheat Ale)

I think the location is great, I'd be up for coming back to check out a wing night or grabbing some drinks."}
{"text":"Suuuuper expensive! A plate of mediocre nachos and some store-bought (really sour) guacamole was $20 - and that was the day the nachos were supposedly on special. The food was bad but the service was ok. The one really good thing I have to say about Brewsters is their Bellini was delicious! Not worth another trip though... We won't be back."}
{"text":"Beer is good as usual. The service was bad...forgot parts of my order 3 waitresses in 20 mins. Food was fine the Alfredo was decent.  definetly come for the beer....eat before hand and expect to wait."}
{"text":"been here on two occasions first time just 2 of us then a group of 16.  Both times the waitress has been very attentive, the food came out correct each time and excellent.  Their Bow Valley Brown Ale was excellent, i did try the Hammerhead Red Ale as well.  I didn't notice but for next time they have a beer sampler available which has i think 8 - 5oz beers for about $7.00. looked like it gives a good representation of its beers.  Some seasonal beers are regulars year round here, blueberry and raspberry.  their menu is on line and worth checking out."}
{"text":"The good: Beautiful rooftop patio,  excellent south Calgary location and better food than many of the other locations I've tried in the city.

The bad: server was slow and very disorganized.. Waited almost 20 minutes for her to bring our drinks. I had to repeatedly ask for things such as cutlery and water.

The ugly: after waiting 1 hour for our food, server informs us that the kitchen \"lost\" our ticket and she forgot what we ordered. Manager was apparently apologetic but never actually made it over to say as much himself. 50% discount taken but I left with a bad taste in my mouth and vowed never to return."}
{"text":"Good food and portions. Reasonably priced with their own microbrews make this a place I keep coming back too.

Their premises is split between a restaurant that is kid friendly and the lounge side which doesnt allow minors. They have a shaded patio as well that can be inviting on a nice summer day.

The service has always been good and the food selection is interesting with typical pub fare along with various Indian and Asian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Solid beer selection. I like that they utilize our local brewery, Wilrose. They rotate between different imported beer, so everyday is a different day. I like that they let you sample their featured beers too.

I caught their brunch menu, and I ordered a short rib eggs benny. Good food. Good service. Great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the happy hour.  They raised the prices and then give you a dollar off glasses of wine and beer.  There is other places that actually have happy hour like earls and OJ.  Last time here for me for happy hour."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Lots of glass,  open and airy.  It's in a mall so sitting outside seemed ridiculous (smell the outgassing from the Burger King next door ). Good beer selection. Tried their Rig Pig,  Curly Horse,  and Honest Paul.  All very good but Honest Paul was the definite winner... great body,  very hoppy. Started with Buffalo BBQ wings. They were small wings and the sauce was not spicy at all. Tasty but not what I was expecting. I had two fish tacos and my buddy had the bison burger. Both were very well done and very tasty.  This place was good enough that we considered going back the next night. (We were there on business)"}
{"text":"I got together with some single ladies at the Brewsters in Crowfoot, and I was pretty darn impressed.

The scene was kickin', the music was pumpin', and the food was sizzlin'!

Our waitress was a true pro, and I was really feeling the crowd, especially on a Tuesday night!

I love that right next door is a Good Earth so you can grab a hot bevvy and a treat, and then literally just walk over to the movie theatres!

The location is prime, the food is good and there is tonnes of parking!

Happy Eating Y'all!"}
{"text":"Best food and service ! Claire is a great server here ! Only thing I would change is add more drink variety! They can't make most cocktails cause they don't have the ingredients :( and same as strawberry daiquiri drinks"}
{"text":"2nd time at this location both times bad experiences. Bar person rolled her eyes when asked what the specials were . I didn't notice her as I was sitting down and she just talked at me . I asked her to repeat it and she made a weak effort to repeat and just walked away when I didn't hear it the second time.  Shitty attitude no customer service skills. She was wearing dirty leather shorts which is fine dress how you want .also there were more then 15 kids under 12 in the restaurant (not what I expected from a brew house)and the place stinks of chlorine. What's with the smell of chlorine. ?  Probably wouldn't have written the review if she hadn't rolled her eyes. Left after one drink."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, that is really most important to me. Wing night is nice and cheap with good wings, and they have managed to make an incredibly boring dish, the Beef Dip, very tasty. Good on yah."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch, as I work in the area. 

The place is a large bar type setting with a plethora of different beers to choose from. The service is always fast and friendly. I find that the servers expect larger tips, but they do work for them. The service, at least at lunch, is quick and the food is always good. I personally like their sandwiches. 

Certainly will be going back."}
{"text":"Great food every time! Service is always consistently good. Quickly becoming my go to for a pub close to home. Roof top patio is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, not amazing but like the atmosphere and they have a great patio!! Some good dishes and good beer. Staff is always pretty friendly."}
{"text":"As I mentioned in my last review, service here is hit or miss. Tonight it is a miss. Being in the industrial, I usually can write off poor service.

I ordered the beef dip with fries and my husband had the buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. When everything arrived, it was barely warm except for the sweet potato fries which were so hot I burned my mouth. There was a skin on the au jus that I had to scoop out with my fork. Obviously everything else was sitting there waiting for the sweet potato fries.

I considered sending everything back but ultimately decided I didn't want to wait for new food since the server was sitting at a table chatting with other patrons. We just decided not to come back.

If you're a trucker looking for decent food and beer not far from the industrial area, this is your place. If you're pretty much anyone else, drive a few more minutes to literally any other Brewsters."}
{"text":"Probably the best patio in town. It's a Brewsters so you have to like their beer to enjoy it. The patio is great but they should make an effort to clean/replace the cushions."}
{"text":"Decided to come back for another one of their tasty beers and to finally try their food which was a definite home run! I don't often give out a full 5 stars but Brewsters knocked it out of the park for me in terms of great atmosphere, delicious food, and amazing beer. 

The menu consists of what you would normally find at a bar like nachos, wings, rips, sliders, fish and chips, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, etc but they also have other unique items and twists on the classics that you won't normally find at other restaurants. Their food is fresh and the prices are decent considering the quality of it. My bf has only gotten their Bavarian Beef Dip ($15) with beef, caramelized onions, white cheddar, horseradish aioli and Hammerhead beer mustard. I can see why because this sandwich is like a bundle of rich, fatty, orgasmic goodness! It's not your typical beef dip; the addition of cheese, aioli and beer mustard takes the sandwich to the next level of flavour city. It's still a pretty good sandwich without the au jus but the juices adds that extra touch of 'melt in your mouth' goodness. The sandwich comes with a side fries or salad and every time my bf gets it he is stuffed.

I tried their Pad Thai Stirfy ($15) with chicken, shrimp, veggies, peanuts, and cilantro which was filling and really good. My only complaint was that it was a little greasy and the sauce was too sweet. A squeeze of lime(s) which I had to ask for helped balance out the sweetness. I also tried their Green Chili Bison burger ($15) with green chili aioli, roasted jalapeños, jalapeño havarti, lettuce, tomato and peppercorn onion rings. This is one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. Yes.. it's probably uber fattening but it was worth it. The patty was nice and moist and the onion rings added that extra oomf of texture. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. Although it was a good burger, I found that after the first couple of bites it got a little bland. I felt that it needed an extra 'something', maybe a relish to add a bit of sweetness to the creaminess of the burger. I also didn't like how the top of the bun was too big (had too much bread) which I don't usually like in my burgers. 

Overall, Brewsters in Crowfoot is the definite place to go!"}
{"text":"So Ive been here about 4 times, and I go weird hours, like 2pm on a wednesday. And the service has always been pretty good.
I like brewsters, I like the beer I like the food, but its not like change your life great or anything. If your in the area and hungry and like beer its worth going to."}
{"text":"Brewsters used to be 5 stars for me - just try the Blueberry Beer; it is amazing! The food was always great, and service fast. The Asian dumplings for example are incredible; light and not too doughy paired perfectly with sweet chili Thai sauce. Great summer patio and the McKenzie Towne location has an even better roof top patio.

Then last fall they took a turn for the worst. They started only hiring the zombie-blond \"Earl's-style\" servers. They also took off the best salad - The Rio Grande - don't know why; it was the most popular off the menu. The year before that they took away the cod boxie (fish on a potato pancake; amazing!) and they killed off dumpling night and steak night.

They brought out new dishes that are mediocre at best (Cantonese chow mien stirfry for example), and they cut all portion sizes by 20-30% while increasing the costs 10-15%. 

I emailed the manager and he forwarded it to the head office where they sent me a template email and proceeded to not care.

Why Brewster's why? I used to eat there 2-4 times a week; now I have not been there in 6 months with no plans to return.

I still eat the dumplings once a week; no one does them better except for me - I found out that they are a Sysco product and ordered me a case of 200 for $35.


ok... I have said my piece; all that being said the food is still better than most pub's and the beer is still great. They brew their own and it is fresh and cold."}
{"text":"Great location it's super close to home for me. It's always so busy in the Mckenzie strip mall area; there's never any parking. It took us 15 minutes of driving up and down to find a stall. The pub was super busy on a Friday night. Our waitress told us to sit at any table even if it was dirty and someone would come and clean it.....10 minutes later. 

We ordered the beef dip which was okay the Au jus had not very good after taste. But the Brewster burger was really good. My boyfriend got the drink special rig pig pale ale ($5.50 on Friday's) with an ice burg cap. He was in love with this drink it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family last night. There was six of us in total. 5 adults and one child so we sat on the family side. Our service was so poor. It was as if they give priority to the bar side rather than the family side. Not only that but there was a children's birthday party that was happening on the family side that I thought was very strange for a children's birthday party to be happening at a pub..? They were very loud and playing football, running around, etc. 
Also the food was not that great. I remember I used to be able to come here and get a delicious soup and salad combo and now they only let you choose form two choices of soup and they do not even have a soup of a day so I got the gyoza and the gyoza came with a really weird sauce. It was a sweet chilli sauce for gyoza? I am used to a soya sauce for my gyoza or a ginger sauce which I would have preferred. Those did not go well together.

Updated February 2018:
I still hold true to this day about my experience there and how it continues to be. The service is never good there and the food is overpriced but I continue to go here because it is a local based pub only in Alberta and it is within walking distance to my house. As I have ben here so many times I have now tried a majority of the food items on the menu. Here is my recommendations: 

Shareables: 
- Nachos- Recommend but overpriced 
- Chicken WIngs: Honey Garlic- Recommend but overpriced 
- Gyoza: RECOMMEND but needs a different sauce

{"text":"I like the beer here, but it is a bit over priced for sure. The food has never let me down, either. Particularly the fish and chips. Would recommend for a quick lunch or dinner but it's definitely not somewhere I would meet with the boys to have a pint or 6."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say.  I love this place.  
I live next door and walk over.   Chicken wings on Tuesday night are .25c after 9pm
5.50 raspberry beers made here in Canada.   Support local.  If you want cheap shit go to burger king next door.   You will get what you pay for you sloppy people.   

Brewster is a fine establishment. Treat the servers with respect.  They are not here for you to walk on."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of Brewsters. Used to come once a week for years. Food quality has gone down hill. Frozen burgers for $16 bucks. What a joke. Unfortunately because this is Calgary, and Brewsters usually has decent amount of customers, their food quality wont change. 

I hope it does, they really had something going."}
{"text":"The choice of beers is cool. They have some good beers on tap.

The food? The same crappy tired fare that all these chain sit-down eateries serve. The stuff isn't made with any passion or love. Just scooped from buckets into pots and frying pans, then served warm. Uninspired.

When you're city has tonnes of great independent restaurants, why would anyone choose to spend money on this sort of stuff?

(And it wasn't my choice to head here. Was with my sister and her daughter. Obviously, I have something to teach my niece about a proper dining experience.)

The ginger beef was particularly horrible.

Hard to believe all these 5-star reviews I'm seeing. What sort of food do these people eat on a regular basis that Brewster's gets such high praise?"}
{"text":"B - List. Great place for a drink and conversation. The food, however, is good and average. If it is food you want, go elsewhere. You decide. 4 or 5 stars? - Huh?"}
{"text":"Not much veggie food. They have a burger, and it was tasty. Beer is all right, with lots of variety. The room is pretty loud when it gets full. 

The service is a real issue, with confused servers wondering who owes for the mystery entree nobody ordered or got, with their hands out at the end of the night. We were a fairly large group, but too bad. The ability to serve competently is more important to me than the server's tan and the little black dress. 

My advice: get your own tab and don't pay for anything you didn't order."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Brewsters or this Brewsters in crowfoot in a while and it probably will be a while until I return. The service was good, the food was average but the prices for what you get in pretty bad. I had a steak sandwich for 18.99 and it was a thin steak on hard old bread with a Cesar salad. Presentation gets a 1/10. I'll give 3 stars because our server was nice."}
{"text":"Let's face it Brewsters hasn't exactly catered to the vegetarian types, consequently, they fell out of my good graces a few years ago when I went hardcore vegetarian. It was just TOO challenging to find anything on the menu. 

This year, however, I became a pescetarian and added fish to my personal menu. Subsequently, I have come to really appreciate Brewsters. The fish tacos are awesome! Not the best I've had in the city, mind, but still good. I really enjoy the spinach, artichoke, and lobster dip, and think it could be the best thing on the menu.

Anyways, I do enjoy Brewsters now that I can eat there, but vegetarians be warned! There is very little for you folks to order!"}
{"text":"Local Brewster's been staple in Mckenzie Towne for a while and haven't been here since some dining changes. 

Oh menu has changed and the food still consistent and hot. Staff are always friendly and helpful to provide suggestions of food. 

I had the blueberry crumble cake with ice cream and it was delicious. 

Had one of Brewster's beer ale and it was yummy. 

Overall can't go wrong with this lively location in High Street."}
{"text":"Always love a lunch here for their blueberry beer. A little pricey for lunch, but their afterwork specials are great. Kitchen was a little slow for lunch service."}
{"text":"Great for beer and outdoor patio. Pretty much it. The service every time I have visited has been horrible. One time I went with my fiancé and as soon as a big table came in we were completely ignored to the point the manager came by and actually asked \"are you going to order\" um yes we did over 30 minutes ago.. Food was alright. A little pricey for their portions."}
{"text":"Brewsters was founded by Michael Lanigan since 1989. It's original a beer company. The company combined beers to provide an outstanding dining experience to customers. There are 11 locations across the Alberta province.  We had a dinner at Brewsters last night.

Environment:

The location we've been is located at Mckenzie Towne Southeast Calgary, which is 10 mins away from our home. The restaurant is located inside the Mckenzie Towne community. There are many other restaurants around that area. We arrived the restaurant around 5 pm. Since it was still very early for the dinner time, the restaurant was not very busy. We walked in the restaurant, I could see there is a big sign at the front, wrote something like \" Wherever you want to sit, take the seat\". We got inside the restaurant and found the table by ourselves. The menu was on the side of each table.

Services:

After we sat down for few mins, our table server came to us and began to serve us the drink. She also introduced Today special to us, which was very helpful.  My boyfriend had today special 16oz beer and I had hot water with Lemon. About 4 or 5 mins, our drink came out. Later on, we began to order food for the main meal. The food came out the kitchen not very fast.

Food:

We have ordered calamari to share.  My boyfriend had the special Bavarian beef dip with yam fries and I ordered Pad Thai Stirfry. The Calamari was crispy and deep fried with cajun remoulade. The taste was decent. Bavarian beef dip was  Slow-roasted Alberta beef, white cheddar, horseradish aioli, Hammerhead beer mustard, caramelized onions, pretzel roll, and au jus. The whole dish looks yummy, but taste was so so. My Pad Thai Stirfry was Sweet & spicy sauce, chicken, tiger prawns, stir-fry mixed vegetables, roasted peanuts, cilantro, rice noodles. There were only three tiger prawns in my bowl. It was very small portions of food for me. The taste was fine. Nothing very excited

Prices:

The price of the food were very expensive with small portions. Calamari $13.99, Beef Dip $16.99, Thai Stirfry $18.99 and plus beers, tax, and tips. All in total, we spent around $70 for dinner.

In summary, Brewsters is a fancy local beef & dining restaurant. The taste of food and beer were decent. Just prices and portions were small."}
{"text":"Food is good, especially like the Sriracha dry rub wings and  the adovada. I wish the adovada was hotter like it is supposed to be but I understand you are feeding the calgary market. I have always had great service seated at the bar, terrible service seated at a table, and although the patio is beautiful I hate it up there because of the children allowed. 

I love their rasberry and peach beers!"}
{"text":"We have gone to Brewsters in Crowfoot a few times.  Fell in love with the burgers!  The brewery puts out several very nice beers.  I have tried a few, I prefer lighter tasting beer and they do mostly heavier, hoppier beers so I will stick with the 2-3 that I like.

The Mac Daddy Burger is amazing!  Overall the food is good pub grub, but we find the menu quite good and have been back a few times.  

Good food and beer, good portions, good service, good prices."}
{"text":"After a good workout at the gym, my sister and I headed over to Brewsters for some lunch to load up on the calories we had just shed. Since my cousin works here, I usually get great service but she was not in that day. Our server was friendly enough. The place wasn't very busy so we quickly found a spot and ordered some drinks. I found their food & drink menu to be pretty bland...they didn't really have anything cool or different, typical chain restaurant type fare. My sister specifically wanted to eat here for the veggie burger, which was really delicious! I had the salmon sandwich and it was also very good. Our server disappeared for a while after we ate so it took a little longer than I would have liked, but overall it was pretty decent. I'll probably come back just because of my cousin - nothing here really stands out for me. I prefer the more unique, independent restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Very convenient if you live in the Mack Town area."}
{"text":"I love this Brewsters, they have such an amazing patio. I have spent many summer nights here and I plan to spend many more. If you go I suggest getting a whole bunch of appetizers to share, it's the best things they have on the menu. I highly recommend the calamari and the pretzels. The pretzel sauce is to die for! They also have great chicken wings, gyoza and potatoe skins. Great place all around."}
{"text":"Brewsters is a bit of Calgary gem. I realize they are in a few cities, but they're still a family run business that is nowhere near being chain restaurant status. Certainly the menu can be hit or miss, but I find the majority of the time the food is excellent.

On this most recent trip we got the Memphis Spring Rolls ($6.99), Bavarian Pretzels ($5.99), Butter Chicken ($17.99), and gumbo with house salad ($13.99). Appetizers were half of that day so we decided to get two. 

Spring rolls and pretzels were both great, however I think I preferred the pretzels. The dough is amazing and the mustard dip is great. I probably wouldn't get spring rolls as my first pick, although they were tasty.

Gumbo and salad is always good, not much else to say there. My wife lived in the southern US for a few years and said the gumbo is fairly legitimate. Butter chicken was fantastic and was enough for two meals. It comes with the butter chicken, jasmine rice, and four slices of naan. The flavours when mixed all together are great. Super delicious.

The service can be poor at times, but this time we were served by a girl named Kaitlyn and she was excellent. When we asked for containers for the left over dips, she instead brought us two containers filled with dip and didn't charge extra. Really impressed with her service."}
{"text":"Went to Brewsters with my brother recently.

Had a burger with the soup of the day,  lobster bisque plus beer of course.

The. Burger was good but the bisque was a bit on the salty side.  When the server asked the obligatory \"How is everything? \" I told her I found the soup a bit salty. She.  apologised and took it back. She came back and comped our drinks there was no argument,  no whining about how how wonderful everyone else found the soup. 

This isn't a review of the food. I've eaten there many times and the food has always been good. It's more a review of the service. I didn't expect to be comped. I assumed the salty soup was a one off thing. I was pleased to see they cared about the opinions of their customers. At least this customer"}
{"text":"There's a lot of good food in Calgary and this place was no exception.

I went here on St. Patrick's day with friends and their drink specials were a fantastic deal (well, for Canada). The service was prompt and friendly and she accommodated us when we unexpectedly added another person. The food was really good, we got gyoza as an appetizer and that chili sauce it came with was amazing. I kept it simple and just got a Caesar salad but it was quite tasty and not overdressed. When I make it back to Calgary, I will probably pay this place another visit."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan of Brewsters.
This particular location is one of the newest additions to the Brewster family - they've really expanded over the last few years, with locations in Calgary, Edmonton, & Regina.
If you've never been to Brewsters before, I would definitely recommend this location for your first experience. Have a peek at the website as well, they show the menu, and lot's of information about the breweries (one in Edmonton, one in Calgary)

The most surprising to me is the pricing.  I can't recall seeing anything on the menu over $16, and they offer a large variety of options as well. Salads (meal-style salads, not just rabbit food), Burgers (veg, chicken or beef), Asian & Indian fusions, pizza & flatbreads.  We both had a hard time deciding what to eat :) I went with a Long Beach salad, my guest tried a seasonal pasta dish (Prosciutto & Portabella, w/ Tomato). Portions were sized well, and I took the advice from the menu, to pair my salad with a pint of River City Raspberry. Very nice!!

We were in just after lunch on a weekday - I've also been on their rooftop patio on a Friday afternoon. The atmosphere difference is like Night & Day, as I'm sure you can imagine.

The patio is fabulous - modern, roomy yet cozy, and a total sun-trap. Check this out next summer for sure.  Inside is very nice too, but the only reason this review isn't 5 stars is because of the service...

I've experienced this before at other establishments, and it seems that the quieter it is, the more the service suffers. I get that you're bored doll face, but you might want to visit our table more than once an hour, and when you do grace us with your presence, try not to act like a robot!
I have pretty high-standards for customer service.  Hmmm - this is turning a little negative...

Brewsters is a fabulous spot for lunch or dinner, and for happy hour or late night drinks. Fun crowd, really great prices, and great looking rooms. The fact that they are a micro-brewery has huge appeal, and you can even buy bottles & kegs right from the brewery :))

They are quickly becoming a well-known chain - which I am happy for, as long as they can keep their local charm. The last thing we need is another... starts with M, ends with oxies :))

{"text":"I know what you're thinking - a Brewsters is a Brewsters right? Wrong. 

After travelling roughly a year to go from Calgary's NW to the deep, deep south and questioning many times if I was even still in Calgary anymore (shockingly I was), I met up with some friends to watch a Flames game here. I've been to Brewsters several times up north (Crowfoot Location) and to be honest the service has always been underwhelming. So has the food. In fact, if I wasn't a beer drinker who also likes antioxidants (they've got a killer blueberry beer here) I'd probably never go out of my way to get to a Brewsters.

But this location won me over with a combination of super friendly staff and a kitchen that seems to actually kind-of, sort-of give a damn whether your meal sucks or not. 

The place was packed, so myself and four friends lined the bar where we could see the game. Lots of screens, so this wasn't too hard.

The bartender took care of us immediately, shooting us menus and pouring drinks like we had raging infernos in our throats that could only be doused out by delicious beer. After spending a few periods here watching the game we were treated to a beer fusion - the bartender poured us all shots of a Huckleberry/Raspberry beer combo. Now, while I'm sure giving us these tiny beers was just a marketing tactic to make us buy more big beers, it WORKED. As soon as that magical Huck/Rasp elixir hit my lips I needed more of it in my life.

And that's something they don't really tell you at Brewsters - you can COMBINE the beers. They should really list that on the menu somewhere - my frankenbeer was amazing.

I ordered a burger. Normally the burgers I've been served at Brewsters have been sloppily put together and pretty greasy. Not so in the magical land of McKenzie Towne. Here my burger was immaculately composed, and while still a little drippy it was far from the messes I've been served in the past.

Our bartender kept the drinks coming with a smile on her face and despite a room brimming with thirsty guests still found a way to keep our glasses full.

So yeah, it's not earth shattering. It's a Brewsters. But if I can save up enough money to afford gas for the Oregon-Trail sized journey to the south and my whistle needs wetting, I'll probably stop in again."}
{"text":"Usually disappointed in the service. Menu is limited but it can be tasty. Patio is hugely wait listed if remotely warm out but it is fun and worth the wait if its friends, drinks and alcohol you want."}
{"text":"The nachos are not worth the $20. They are maybe $12 nachos at best. Atmosphere is dismal, morale is low. It is super dark and not an ideal place for a date. Real conversation with the waitress :

Me: can I please have a sex on the beach please 
Waitress: The drink

Amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there today.  I knew the food would be good, but it even exceeded my expectation. We ordered the meatloaf with mac and cheese and short rib ravioli. Food was hot, well presented and tasted great."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar alone, just wanted to go for a couple quiet pints and a bite to eat. Bartenders never seemed to be doing anything half the time. Not serving, not talking, just ignoring people pretty much. Empty glasses sat too long. I ordered a beer, using their \"Rig Pig\" name, and got a strange look. Finally when I mentioned I've never been here before I got much more attention paid to me. And the female bartender was around a whole lot more. And even offering up samples after that. Ordered the steak sandwich, which was pretty decent. Perfect amount of food with it. I'll likely give it another chance. But it certainly didn't scream \"awesome\" at me like I'd been told."}
{"text":"Good beer, decent food, just ok service.

My wife and I arrived early on a Friday after work to meet some friends and snag a table as we thought it would be busy on a nice sunny day. It wasn't that busy which was nice so we had our choice of seats.

We ordered drinks while we waited and i got a start on a flight of beer. It had been a long time since I had been to a Brewsters so I thought a flight would be a good way to sample many of their summery seasonal and fruit beers. Overall their beers are alright, nothing was outstanding, but nothing was completely terrible either.

For dinner I went with the fish tacos. I find in Calgary that restaurants will have either really good fish tacos or not so good fish tacos. Brewsters fish tacos unfortunately get a thumbs down. They were dry and the dry fish was attempted to be covered up by sauce.

The server was odd. She almost completely ignored the ladies at the table. I didn't notice it at first but the others at the table pointed it out. She also disappeared for a while when our food was being served and didn't come back to see if we needed another round or anything until it was too late."}
{"text":"I generally avoid this location because it's crazy in the summer with their rooftop patio, even though its within walking distance from my house. Usually I opt for the 52nd Street location which seems to only be busy with the after work happy hour crowd.

Some friends suggested coming here for dinner last night and reserved a table. Our server was really on top of things as we didn't even have our jackets off when she came by to greet us. As usual, the beer was great and they had a few seasonal options available which included their delicious Octoberfest. Bombers of Octoberfest were also on special so I nabbed a bunch of those for $5 each.

For dinner I gave the buffalo chicken wrap a try with the house salad. Both were great. I appreciate that the house salad was more than just some shitty lettuce with some carrots and a tomato wedge on it. My wife got the chicken burger which I also gave a try and was decent."}
{"text":"Good food. I particularly like the patio. It's nice and warm in the summer, and nice and sunny on a sunny day"}
{"text":"We met up with some friend at this neighborhood pub and grub.  The guys put down a couple of beers, but I stuck with a good ol' Canadian caesar (only in Canada where Clamato is on the mixer tap).  When in Rome, right?

We were STARVING, but since we were meeting up for dinner with some other people later, we only put in an order for the Barvarian pretzels.  The waitress forgot to put it in immediately, so that delayed our service.  Boo.

The pretzels came out piping hot and were served with an awesome mustard dip on the side.  Definitely satisfying.

Decent bar if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"You know what?!  I love Brewsters... and I say it proudly!  I've only ever had good experiences every time I go.

Not only do I love the location (Crowfoot NW, by all my friends) but I love the restaurant itself.  It has a nice ambiance inside, with a lounge area and gorgeous patio for the summer!  The lounge has plenty of high stools and tables, which I love, but also has booths and chairs by the bar.

I'll admit that the cost of drinks might be a little higher than say Boston Pizza, but i think it's fair.  They have a bunch of their own beer... in fact, that's all they serve.  You can't get Keith's or Canadian at this place.  Only Brewsters brewed beer.  It's pretty neat.  My favourite is the blueberry beer they have... which comes with blueberries in it.  Very yummy!

They have a nice selection on their food menu as well.  They offer a different variety of pizzas and appetizers... stuff you don't usually see.  I love the dumplings they have, which come with a lovely dip!

The staff are always so cool, too.  One guy we had, who was serving our table of twelve, had a little trouble keeping the drinks straight but made up for it by bringing us a couple of free jugs.  I'll let slide a couple of missed drinks for free jugs... anytime!

So, yeah!  That's why I love Brewsters in Crowfoot.  It's a great place for family or friends!"}
{"text":"The burgers are way overpriced for what you get - they come with fancy toppings, but the actual burger itself is crappy quality and they're a bit stingy on sides. Beers also seemed a bit expensive - and a quesadilla with sweet potato fries comes to nearly $20!! It may be rated \"$$\" for cost - but you might leave feeling a bit like you've overpaid."}
{"text":"I was at this location on a Saturday having late lunch. The place was nice and was pretty busy. I got the Mango Chicken Quesadilla and it was pretty tasty. The biggest complaint I have is the service. I'm not sure if the lady was under the weather or just not nice in general but she was one of the most impolite servers I got. 
When we sat down, she gave us the most unwelcoming introduction. I figured she was busy and in a rush so I let it go. When she came back to see if we're ready to order (we weren't because we just got the menu less than a minute ago and were unfamiliar with the menu) and we asked her a question about the menu, she responded like we were stupid or something. Again, I let this one go. Then when we were finally ready to order, she took our order and everything was fine. But halfway through our meal, we were just taking a break from eating and our server went to our table and asked if we we're done with our meal. We said no and she left. Then a couple of minutes later, I see our server looking at us like she really wanted us to leave, and she walks to our table and again asked if we're done eating (we weren't, we barely even touched the drinks we ordered) and we felt forced by her tone, so we just said \"yeah sure.\" We still had a lot of food left and she didn't even bother giving us a chance to say anything else, nor did she ask if we wanted the food packed up. 

I really wish other customers don't get the same treatment as we did from this server."}
{"text":"Beer was great. Slow service on a Saturday afternoon. 15 min to get drinks. Wings were good. Avacdo Swiss burger might have been good if it was warm. Way better food out there stay away. Spend your money where they have a little more pride in what they do."}
{"text":"The menu was pricey.  Pretty good service.  Below average food.  Gravy sucked.  Beef dip & chicken club both not very tasty.  Probably will not come here again."}
{"text":"Ok so that's my hometown Brewsters, so I'm biased!

However...

I actually like this place. Not to five stars, because they are not that close and personal - but everything else is good.

Kitchen work - very decent. Reasonably good portions, for right amount of money, arriving on my table quickly.

Nice selection of local beers, and just in general good bar - I like it as much as the dining room.

Servers and especially meet-and-greet girls were more of a hit-and-miss, especially a couple of months ago, but recently getting better and better - so no complaints here.

So would I hesitate to invite someone there? Not a second. Good place, glad we have that in McKenzie.

Could be even better if they'd recognize a local after about half a year and just say \"hi\" - some places are better at that then the others, but oh well..."}
{"text":"I do enjoy their craft beer selections, however sometimes the selection is limited.  
The food is on and off, but usually quite good.
It's a nice hangout for the McKenzie Towne folk."}
