{"text":"What a spectacular breakfast place. The food was amazing, presentation beautiful, and ambiance welcoming and cozy."}
{"text":"The old Fruits Folie on St Denis. A solid, basic breakfast place. Nothing fancy, nothing surprising. Everything was done well, the service was nice, the location is good. Coffee refills flowing. Great place for your basic breakfast fare. Very good prices."}
{"text":"Je crois qu'on est mal tombés. On a attendu 3/4 h pour avoir le petit déjeuner et heureusement qu'on a réclamé la carte ! La serveuse n'était pas très douée ni très aimable. C'etait bon mais sans plus ... C'était pourtant une adresse reprise dans plusieurs guides... Mais bof !"}
{"text":"Nice little unpretentious dinner. It was packed on a Saturday morning but the staff was great at moving the line along as fast as possible. Our food came out fast and the biscuits were delish! I'd totally go back :)"}
{"text":"The place was way too hot (no AC during summertime, really?), the food took way too long, the waiter was messy, dropped those small packages of cream for coffee and never picked them up, and then a customer walked in, stepped on them and splashed cream all over us. We decided waiting 25 min for breakfast under those circumstances was not worth it, so we got up and left. I wish we had at least tried the food."}
{"text":"Service sympa mais sans plus, nous etions un groupe avec un menu destiné avec la soupe en entree qui n'etait pas top et pas assez chaude selon moi. Le plat principal etait l'assiette de tagliatelle ou les pates baignaient dans la sauce. Sinon le cadre est sympa. mais je ne serai dire pour le prix. Bref une fois pour l'essayer et a vous de juger."}
{"text":"Very cheap brunch.  Lots of options.  A lot of their meals include free coffee.  If you want brunch or made last minute plans to go to brunch, this is a great place to go to. Super cozy place as well! I'll probably go again if my friends and I want to go to a cheaper alternative to our typical brunch restaurants."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for brunch but it is the perfect go-to. The eggs Benedict are incredible, especially for only around 13$. Easy to get to, cute decor, terrasse when it's warm, and nicely presented plates. I don't think this place has ever let me down."}
{"text":"After seeing the line at L'Avenue du Plateau we decided to try to find another place to get breakfast. Some wandering around and asking locals lead us here. What a great find. I had the burger benedict which was very filling and good with a PILE of fresh fruit. Others at the table had other versions of the benedict which they all enjoyed. Service was attentive and  they were able to easily accommodate our party of 8. Patio dining was also excellent, not too noisy, crowded and good shade from trees nearby."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour déjeuner, j'ai pris une crêpe choco-banane. La pâte n'était pas assez cuite, la garniture était pas bien bien impressionnante. Ça aurait été ''correcte'' si ça n'avais pas coûté aussi cher pour quelque chose d'aussi peu réussi!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in Montreal! Cute restaurant. I had strawberry pancakes with Nutella and fresh fruit. You get a squeeze bottle filled with Nutella to put on as much as you want. Breakfast is served till late. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Très bon brunch, en terrasse. Assiette bien remplie, variée et de qualité. Une valeur sûre à un bon rapport qualité-prix!"}
{"text":"Wandering the streets of Montreal it is very easy to walk past this unassuming brasserie.... And, it would be a mistake. A garage door opens to spill out onto the sidewalk in better weather. And art for sale dots the walls. We ordered the Merguez Baguette served with salad and fries. The sandwich was smallish but very tasty. The Merguez was well spiced but not spicy. Huge salad and large portion of fries. The asparagus and goat cheese Benedict was perfectly prepared. The goat cheese added a gamey dimension to the creamy slightly lemony hollandaise. My wife commented that the fruit salad that was served with it was the best she ever had.. 11 different fruits were represented and the melon to quality fruit ratio was generous!  I would recommend passing by the more famous brasseries in this block and give a try to this underdog!"}
{"text":"Loved the egg Benedict!!!Also, very cute atmosphere with great service. Looking forward to visit again!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be more accurate Came in this morning at 10 with a friend since we were close by. The shop was empty save us and one other customer at the time (by the time we left, 2 more had come). I had the mademoiselle (sautéed vegetables + cheese) eggs benny. A very good deal, huge portions, but OK food. The hollandaise sauce was not the best that I've had-- it's a little runnier and lighter than most and I like mine creamy. Eggs were good. Potatoes were deliciously seasoned. Came with complimentary tea/coffee! The waitress was also very friendly."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Now I have another reason to come back to this beautiful city. Food Quality, flavor and presentation are superb. Fruits are fresh and with a lot of variety. I found service was fast, efficient and very Courteous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. A solid brunch place the usual brunch offerings: eggs, crepes, pancakes, french toast, eggs Benedict, etc. The fruits are displayed in a very flattering way; i enjoyed the potatoes. The quality and taste are good, but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot on a cool part of rue St-Denis. Had the traditional eggs over easy with ham and sausages, and was served with perfectly-cooked home fried potatoes, very fresh fruits. Delicious and very filling. Great service, too. All at a surprisingly low price. A real find."}
{"text":"Solid neighbourhood breakfast joint that has fast and decent service. They have a nice selection for a variety of prices. I often come here because they have smaller breakfast options for light morning eaters like me. Today I indulged in spreading the caramel they gave me on my toast. O. M. G. Am I allowed to eat that everyday please?"}
{"text":"Petit bistro près du métro Sherbrooke (au coin de rue St-Denis et Sherbrooke). Décor simple et cozy.  Bouffe: On est allé pour un souper. J'ai pris des pâtes et mon ami baguette au poulet scaloppini. Mon ami dit que son plat était un peu salé, mais les deux plats sont bons, bonnes portions et pas chers (2 plats principaux+2 cocktails+un entrée=48$ tax. inclus).   Service rapide et la serveuse était sympa. C'est sûr que nous retournerons :)"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch because I'm on a specific diet and so is my friend, and this place matched both our requirements. I can't say I'm keen to come back.   The food is okay, although my chef friend pointed out that it looked like his apple (cut into a fancy shape) had been out for several hours as it was browning, and my smoked salmon stuffed avocado was quite brown as well. It takes a while to get avocado to brown so that's pretty worrying. Also they put way too many capers on my salad! Like a handful of the damn things!   I had a side of fèves au lard, for $2, and I got... a tiny pot full of awful watery lukewarm beans. Not impressed with that! It costs less than $2 for a can of beans from the supermarket that are better than this, and that's a whole can!  The service was spotty at best - the waitress at one point asked if we were ready to order, and when we said yes she wandered off to another table right behind us, walked off past us, and didn't come back for five minutes.   Sorry, L'Evidence, but this was a pretty crappy brunch for a city that's supposed to be great for brunch."}
{"text":"Bistro ayant remplacé le Fruits Folie ouvert depuis des années sur la rue St-Denis. Connaissant l'ancien restaurant, je peux dire que le service et l'endroit a bien changé. Déjà ils ont donné un coup de frais à l'établissement, qui est plus chaleureux et semble plus propre qu'à l'époque. On garde les mêmes banquettes larges agréables en groupe. Pour ce qui est du menu, on accorde beaucoup de place aux fruits encore une fois, c'est apprécié. Un petit point de plus pour la serveuse qui est sorti aider ma sur qui avait une poussette, vraiment très serviable. Nous avons reçu nos commandes rapidement, très satisfaites de nos plats, la coupe de fruits avec yaourt nature très impressionnante et mon bagel au uf/bacon/tomate/laitue rien à redire. Et bon café en plus! Alors on y va parce qu'on aime la chaleur de l'endroit, la nourriture simple, pas très dispendieuse et bonne :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfasts! All come with fresh and perfectly ripened fruit, many different varieties! Eggs Benedict absolutely scrumptious, omelet with crepe also very good! Nice presentation and good quality for a reasonable price. Wanted to go back again the next day, but since we were in Montreal for such a short time we thought we should try another place. Will definitely go again on a return visit!"}
{"text":"I have some mixed feelings about this place. This is a decent brunch place with lots of options on the menu, and good sized portions at very cheap prices. They have alot of seating inside (and outside seating also in the summer), so you will likely not be stuck waiting long to be seated. The decor inside is very typical no frills breakfast joint decor and the food was just okay. I ordered scrambled eggs with all 3 meats , potatoes and toast. The plate was big enough to be filling but not so big that it was overkill. My food arrived pretty fast once we were able to order. It wasnt bad by any means but it was really nothing to write home about. Service was pretty slow (not many coffee and water refills either) , even though we went on a day that wasnt overly busy, but she was still pleasant and we were able to spend some time finishing our coffee and chatting after our meal without feeling rushed which was nice. While I have nothing too bad to say about this place, I also have nothing to say about it that makes it a standout to me, which is why I am going with the three star rating. However, if you're in the area looking for cheap decent brunch and dont feel like waiting in line (especially if you're a group) this is a good option and is family friendly."}
{"text":"Good eggs benedict and generous portions of fruits. If you're looking for a place to have brunch with friends, then this could be your option. If you're on a run, you can get your brunch to go. I did just that and enjoyed my eggs at home while watching a movie."}
{"text":"Très bonne place avec une belle terrasse. Le service était très agréable et très efficace. Le jour de notre visite, il y avait peu de monde mais beaucoup de serveuse. Le brunch a été très bon, nous avons passé du bon temps."}
{"text":"Great brunch place with tons of seating. They have outdoor seating as well as a smaller back room. The waitresses are super nice, and their menu is extensive. Basically eggs however you want. I had the eggs Benedict complete (with ham, Swiss and mushrooms). It was a TON of food, plus homefries on the side and a healthy portion of fruit. A great hangover cure, to be sure. Also had a nice glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Perfect for getting you ready for a day of heavy drinking!"}
{"text":"Un très bon brunch du dimanche, assiette généreuse et goûteuse, le tout pour un prix raisonnable. Menu classique, service sympathique et efficace. Je vous encourage à y aller faire un tour, vous ne serez pas déçus !"}
