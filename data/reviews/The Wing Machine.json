{"text":"I am surprised this place hasn't gotten a review yet!  Now, there are fast food places like Mc Donalds, KFC, Wendy's, etc... But if you want a good burger, check this place out! I personally recommend the banquet burger. It was delicious and will not disappoint. I been a customer for a good year now and I never been hesitant to test out their sauces. Don't even get me started. They make good sauce!"}
{"text":"This location is incapable of reading the orders not once nor twice but three times , I was sent incorrect order. Called customer service after holding for over 10mins to speak to an awful rude customer service supervisor ? Named NATESH something like that apparently . Lied about speaking to the location on the second mistaken order which is a lie because I spoke to a pleasant lady not this unprofessional rude ignorant being . Please save yourself money and time and do not order from here !"}
{"text":"If I could show zero stars, I would. Never have I been more disappointed.  Tasteless pizza on a frozen, cardboard-like crust. Chicken wings are so small, you get about 20 in a pound. They forgot the fries, so we had to wait for the delivery driver to go get them and come back. Then they sent a 7-Up when a Diet 7-Up was ordered.  A horrible experience. First and last time for me at this place. $35 down the drain."}
{"text":"This place is amezing . I order on just eat all the time and i never get disappointed. Good portions , tasty pub food and reasonable prices, if you want to eat alot just call this place. I suggest to try the ribs for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a few times. Very good service and the food's decent. Wings are baked not fried which I'm not a fan of but their burgers are surprisingly good and you can get jerk chicken on your pizza which is the bomb."}
