{"text":"Superb very clean and the staff are great!! cool atmosphere Love the dishes yumm nothing that I cant complain about!! In the Summer I love their roof top Patio. I'l come back again for sure!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't like reviewing chains very often, so I won't say too much about this. 

I just want to let you guys know that the best appetizer in my opinion is the pesto shrimp flatbread! Love it. This time I came here I got the lobster grilled cheese, which I found to be way too greasy. My friend had steak and their mashed potatoes, which looked really good. They also had this drink on special that tasted like a coke slurpee, and it was delicious! I unfortunately forget what it is called though. Just be careful because they taste so good and they will catch up on ya! 

Our server took forever to bring us our bill when we were leaving, which made us late to our movie. That was a bit annoying, but it was Friday night and the lounge was busy, so I get it."}
{"text":"Do not go here, it is not like the other Joey in Calgary. Food was horrible and portions were tiny. Food did not match the description on the menu and our waiter ignored us and was weird"}
{"text":"Another Earl's/Moxie's carbon copy. Officially Joey's is called 'Joey Tomato's Mediterranean Grill'... I struggle to see why. On the current menu, there are several \"Asian\" themed items (Chinese, Japanese, and even Thai-derived,i I believe), BBQd meats (chicken, ribs), Indian, Italian (token pasta and sausage), \"Mexican\" (fish tacos, anyone?), seafood (tuna, king crab, salmon, basa, and even lobster), and steaks. Honestly, with such a varied menu, how can you prepare them all well? Nothing special or unique here. You will get a predictable meal at best... and Barbie will even bring it to your table."}
{"text":"A visually pleasing place. Hot waitresses, beautiful decor, and great food presentation. The service and food is wonderful as well.

The food tasted great when i went out with the family. We had a salmon and a pasta dish. The asian appetizer ( forgot the name!) is delicious, its in a long dish with soy sauce. Try it!

The price is a little more than a bargain, much like Earls. I would go here over Earls any day though. Simply put, they do Earls better than Earls does Earls."}
{"text":"pretty average spot.. I go here to grab a quick something to eat/drink before the movie, but wouldn't make it a date night kinda place."}
{"text":"The food is really comforting when it turns to be either lunch or dinner. But there are not much variety in the menu and sometimes the attention takes ages to be in place."}
{"text":"Joey Tomato's is alright, but like its cousin Earl, it's over-priced and needlessly overdone with attempts at ambiance....

I had the rotisserie chicken with fries that was pretty good. The fries were more memorable than the chicken though. They have these very thin shoestring fries, but they're actually quite good and I enjoyed them.

Again, however, this is a place that charges you 20 something dollars for a sirloin steak. That just isn't right, no matter what you do to it. This Joey's can get busy on the weekend, so expect to wait a bit. Or just hop on the bar side and fight with people for a seat. That seems to be the way they do it here...."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat when at Chinook mall. I have tried allot of the food and always find it good.  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  

For appitizers, I recommend the tuna tacos, or the lettuce wraps.  YUM.  The beach salad is one of my favourite choices for an entree.  

I prefer italian wines, and they are missing that in their \"by the glass\" section.  I always struggle a bit with the wine choices available as a result."}
{"text":"Was there over the long weekend on a trip an it was the worst place ever!!!
Was there with a few people an the food was horrid. What was ordered was soup, fries they were cold sent them back then got over cooked ones, lettuce wrap stuffing was completely cold, chili beef was none to be found, calamari was not fresh an rubbery, tried to order there drink of the day a  an was told I could have one cause the machine wasn't making them the ordered a rum punch an got rum an clamato juice almost puked at the table.
Manger came to the table an had thought he would comp the bill but just took the fries an the drink off the bill. I will not be going back there or promote this place to anyone but tell them to stay far away from it!!!!"}
{"text":"it saids very famous in Calgary, so I went there today. After finishing shopping at chinook, I got there for just a few minutes, near the door of chinook. My friend and I ordered three dishes, one is TK noodles,another is rice, and a TK salad. We were very full, and it costed totally around $60. I like it, I will try others next time."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Tuesday around 12:30 for lunch. The hostess and two servers were standing there and none of them greeted myself or my friend. We asked for a table upstairs on the patio, she told us to go look ourselves. Ok...so went upstairs, there seemed to be space but nobody up there to help us either. We went back downstairs and asked the stuck up hostess if we could have a table upstairs. She asked us if there was one available. I then asked her wasn't that her job to know. She said it wasn't and that she only seats people in the dining room. She said we should tell her if there were seats up there. Worst customer service EVER. 

We ended up sitting in the lounge (seating ourselves) and the waitress was alright but again not very friendly or helpful. 

The food was pretty decent but I will never go back here as this place clearly does not understand simple customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I go to Joey's Chinook probably a few times a month minimum, sometimes every week. I have to say in all the times we have been there, we have only had 2 below par service experiences, one was bad enough that we had to talk to a manager.. BUT that manager dealt with the issue & made sure that we were happy and in fact, in the end we loved this place even more. For the most part, the service is delightful, the drinks and food are incredibly tasty (especially the long iceland double slush Iced teas,) and there is a GREAT atmosphere). It seems like management genuinely cares about customer satisfaction & making an impact on the community around them and I love that.

We go out and eat at a number of restaurants & really enjoy trying new things but we both agree that Joey's is still one of our favs... and we'll be visiting for years to come."}
{"text":"It's your average semi-upscale restaurant, but I enjoy coming here. The music *usually* is to my liking, and if you can avoid peak hours, you can usually be seated within seconds. The decor is warm, and the seating is fairly comfortable. Oddly enough, I always seem to get the same table (3rd table on the right as you enter the restaurant). I've yet to be on the bar/lounge side, but it seems a bit noisy for my liking.

Now, to the food! Personal favorites?

-Coco Nova to drink. It's a bit tart for some, but I like it. My only complaint is that it's a touch expensive..

-Blue Cheese Sirloin. I usually get mine done medium, but how you try it is up to you (obviously). I LOVE the 'Blue Cheese Butter' that comes on the steak. The veggies that come with it are also rather nice, however, the crispy mash were a little off once. 

-Individually Baked Apple Pie. Comes with quite a bit of cinnamon powder and caramel sauce. Opt for Maple Ice Cream if you like it a touch sweeter. 

Presentation is on par for what you would expect from a place like this, but the portions are reasonable. 

Overall, it's a good place to go just to relax, enjoy some good food, and have fun with friends. 

Live well, rest well, be well =)"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I love this place! The vegetarian menu may be short but the soy protein tastes amazing. I've had the soy protein butter 'chicken' twice now and I love it. 
The garlic bread appetizer was yum and my mum and friends have also really enjoyed their food. 
First experience, service was okay. Second time service was beyond great!"}
{"text":"In my sojurns to Vancouver and Alberta, I am familiar with the Joey chain and overall have had good experiences when dining for dinner and this location was no exception. Arriving on the early side I was able to take a two top at the lounge facing the TV's. Having had a light lunch I was famished and decided to have the Japanese Surf and Turf which I previously had at one of the the Joey Bentall locations in the Coal Harbour area of Vancouver.  

Since the CAB Prime was presented as 5 ounces I asked my server if the kitchen could kick it up a notch on the steak portions and paid a slight charge for 7 ounces which was great that the kitchen was accommodating. 

When my entr√©e came out, the presentation was spot on and their version of the California roll had a great profile and the roll was cold temperature wise. Don't you just hate when sushi rolls come out warm and one wonders how long the fish has been sitting out at room temperature before plating and service!

My server Danielle was great and knowing that I was traveling on business and from the states, she did not rush me even after the dinner rush started and always checked on how I was doing without being intrusive.

In closing, the Night Manager, Cody Hall came to my table and introduced himself to me as I was getting ready to leave and I complimented the kitchen team for a great dining experience. Out of the several Joey locations that I dined at this one was a slight cut above all around for serve, food and presentation!

Four \"solid\" stars and Thank You Joey Chinook for a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"This review isn't for a full meal, but drinks and snacks.

Ended up at the mall around 9:30 waiting for a movie that didn't start until 10:45. Came here with friends for drinks and some snacks. The yam fries were excellent and vegan, and the coke with vodka lemon ice was affordable and strong. Server was able to give us our check early and was very helpful. I was pleasantly surprised with the whole experience, especially as someone who hates huge shopping centers and avoids chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place. I stop in every time I am in Calgary. Consistently great food. I usually go with either one of my two favorites - their Baja fish tacos or the sashimi tuna salad. Both are delicious. 

They have a lounge side and restaurant side. The lounge can get quite noisy during peak times so be warned if you don't like it noisy. Also, lounge is self seating. This place is quite popular so be prepared to wait if you go during peak times. My recommendation is to avoid the crowds and go just before lunch or dinner so that you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot better than others. Other than the fact that its in the mall.

The servers here seem a lot more focused and competent than some of the other locations. They are also down to earth and approachable which is awesome.

Service is the right mix of attentive but not intrusive. The food is tasty and consistently well prepared. I have found the the speed in which the food comes out is also pretty fast, regardless of how busy they seem to be. Everything is always fresh, hot and well plated. Prices are reasonable too for what you get, whether you want a snack or a meal.

If this wasn't in the mall Id probably go more often but its one of the best sit down dining choices Chinook has to offer."}
{"text":"When I am looking for somewhere normal to eat, I eat at Joey's.

The service, the drinks, the food, the location at Eau Claire; good, good, good, good all around.

Joey's is a straight-forward, no-frills place that offers a menu that mixes the familiar with the just north of different.

If you're looking for a place to have a normal meal; maybe your friend is visiting from that small town you're from; go to Joey's, have a cheddar burger with a side of edamame or the viva salad with garlic pan bread, it's pretty darn good.

T."}
{"text":"I LOVE this patio, but the Service is horrible. 
Sad. The time and money spent on making this place on par with what's happening in today's food industry . I was psyched to watch the chefs in Italy promo on the TV before our table was sat.  BUT, they can't create a top notch experience
Dying of thirst, couldn't even get a water. Sat with dirty plates for 20 minutes, still no water. I watched our server do her round and completely miss our table. 
Also, they used mojito mint in the salad dressing, way too overpowering. 
Joeys, you failed."}
{"text":"Best food and services at Joeys Chinook. I will recommend molten lava chocolate souffl√© as dessert course. Even they open late."}
{"text":"Always a good stand by when it comes to a decent lunch/dinner.  Especially before or after the movie theatre. This time we went after an impromptu shopping trip through Chinook mall.  

Seated on the restaurant side, my kids had the sliders with fries and chicken fingers - just ask the waitress for the kids menu items as they do not have specific 'kids menus'.  Didn't feel like having a meal so my husband and I ate shared a bunch of appies.  

Good selection as usual, however I must not have been to a Joey's for a while (or not noticed until now) they are no longer offering the crab and artichoke dip with pasta chips. Booooo.  Seriously disappointed.  We ordered a different dip recommended by our server, but it was definitely NOT the same.  

Overall, the picks were good, wine was decent and the service was pleasant and quick.  Be prepared for the long trek to the bathrooms - has anyone yet fallen down those stairs especially after a few. . . ? 

Bring back the crab and artichoke dip please."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go here for her birthday. To start off, they had a fancy piece of paper on the door asking people to come back at 6:30 while showing up at 6:00. Ok. Off to Chapters for a few.  

Greeted by young smiling faces and we were given a seat right away in the dinning area.... right by the kitchen. Not bad but when you're hungry, and smelling all that food cooking, you think about eating your napkin.

Food was great. Looking forward to going back in the summer to rooftop patio."}
{"text":"I love Joey... even back when it was called Joey Tomato's... I always have been a huge fan so I was happy that the food was still consistent and wonderful at this location!
We came with a party of four and shared the Chinatown Wrap with shrimp which was tasty... My main was the beach salad which was equally fresh, exciting and filling.
Of course I had the Kronenbourg Blanc that was on tap. The only thing I didn't like was when the guys at our table finished their drinks the waitress came back right away and asked them if they wanted another (of course! they replied) but when myself and the other woman at the table finished ours... No one came to ask us if we did. And I would have!
By the time she did come back just to pick up our glasses - not even ask if we wanted something else everyone was done our meals and there was no time for another anyways. 
Besides this I enjoyed this location and would come back after a day of shopping or if someone suggested this specific location."}
{"text":"This Joey Tomato's is one of the better ones in town. Conveniently located in Chinook Centre, this Joey's tends to get pretty packed, pretty fast.

It IS the ideal date spot after all. I mean, some dinner/drinks/dessert, followed by a movie at the Scotiabank Theatres in the same mall - makes for a fantastic evening.

I highly recommend skipping the dining area and having a seat in the lounge. It's beautifully decorated, the service is good and you wont be stuck waiting for a seat!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's been happening here lately this place used to be great. The past 5 visits the food came out either cold or everything else but delicious . The portions keep on getting smaller we were just talking about it with a bunch of friends as everyone is experiencing the same. The service isn't as it used to be either. We won't be coming back it's been repeatedly bad"}
{"text":"There is always a bit of a wait for dinner here, you can try your luck with finding a table I'm the lounge or putting your name on the list for the restaurant side. Service is usually pretty good but food can come out a bit slow. I really like the Katsu peanut salad and yellowfin tuna salad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I didn't realize I hadn't reviewed it yet! 

I really appreciate the fact that they will turn any (or most) of their menu items in to a vegan item just for you. No sad, sour pasta or sad, dry veggie burger or gross salad with raspberry vinaigrette (blech). Their Watchamacallit wine reminds me of a candy bar they have in the States, and it's dangerously delicious. Their miso ramen bowl is nice, nothing awesome, but I like it enough to order it again. Wait staff here is cheerful and pleasant.

Also, I once... no wait, haha. I can't tell you guys that story. So four for you, Joey Coco."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Joey Chinook since the renovations.  We were aiming for a quick dinner and was surprised to find that the wait was not too long - so decided to check it out!

Atmosphere: 4/5  Very trendy and modern atmosphere; cozy at the same time. We were seated in nice booths in the dining area; lots of parking and conveniently located at Chinook centre

Food: 4/5  I had the herb crush salmon, which came with new sides of quinoa and vegetables.  I must say I really liked the new sides which worked well with the salmon.  Good presentation. 
 The salmon itself was cooked well to my liking.  Even though the dish did not look big to start with, it was filling and tasted delicious.

Service: 3.5/5  Overall friendly and efficient; ability to pay using an app is convenient and we were out in time for a movie afterwards!

Overall: 4/5  Overall great meal and efficient service in a convenient location w great atmosphere; would definitely return!"}
{"text":"We came here for a date night and sat in the lounge. Nice ambience - however - we waited FOREVER for a server. We both ordered the tenderloin, I asked for medium and had mine brought to me rare. I had a sour jack and it was yummy. The stuffed potatoes are very good. Typical prices. Probably wont be back given the mediocre experience and the fact that there are much better choices of places to eat near this location."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, not bad service and the atmosphere is awesome there. 

Make sure you book a reservation ahead of time even when you think it would have died down. Even at 9:30 it was still a half hour wait."}
{"text":"When I went it was a really long wait. But the staff were fantastic and incredibly attentive once you did manage to get a table. I had the pecan strawberry salad and it was awesome, the people who I was with also really enjoyed their meals. My only complaint was that as patrons, we were all girls, and the waiter was flirting so hard core it was actually painful. I understand that being a little flirty here and there as well as friendly is good for tips, but we were getting uncomfortable at how far he went."}
{"text":"I decided it would be a great idea to go to dinner at Joeys on Friday night at 8:30-9 pm thinking that the rush would have died down. Boy, I was sure wrong. My guy and I were told the wait would be half an hour but we only waited ten minutes! The service is great because you can choose to have a drink while you're waiting for a table and the hostesses are very accommodating. I decided not to have a drink and stuck with coke the entire night. 

We were taken to our table in the dimly lit dining room, where I have sat many many times. I love the lighting and the decor and the seats are so comfortable except for the fact that you really sink down in them. I felt like I was 5 and needed a booster seat. Anyway, my date had the bacon mushroom burger, which when it came out, it looked like a mountain. Definitely a man burger. I had the chicken souvlaki which was delicious but in my mind nothing beats Opa! for that. Previously, I've had the California Chicken burger and the shrimp flat bread and I am always impressed. 

For dessert, I ordered the strawberry shortcake which is my favorite dessert EVER. I always always order it when I go to Joeys. I adore this dessert except for the fact that it is crazy sweet. This time, there wasn't as much sugar in the whipped cream so that helped but the cake itself is very sweet along with the strawberry topping. I usually take half of it home to finish the next day when my sweet tooth arises! 

Joey's is great for almost anything. Dates are fantastic there but so are girl's nights!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business & came here as it was convenient for myself & an employee while visiting Chinook Centre. Nice modern decor, pretty typical for a chain-style restaurant. The restaurant itself was not busy during our particular visit, but service was sadly quite slow. We were not in a hurry, but had we been - well, it would have been an issue. Other than the slow service & disappearing act, the girl serving us was quite lovely.

We both ordered drinks prior to our food - about 10 minutes after ordering, I was alerted to the fact that a main ingredient for my cocktail was unavailable, so I needed to make a new choice. At this point we should have placed our order for food, as another 10 minutes or so passed before we received the drinks or saw our waitress again.

Once we finally got our food orders in the meals came fairly quick. The food itself was quite beautifully presented and tasted just fine. Nothing that I would be dying to come back for, as I'm sure there are many better choices for semi-fine dining in the Calgary area. I was hoping it would taste as beautiful as it looked. 

Overall, I would suggest trying another option if looking for a more upscale dining choice. Otherwise, I hear there is a perfectly adequate food court that would save you time & money at Chinook."}
{"text":"Good chain, some days the chef is better than others

Make the same cole slaw in one store does not mean they taste the same between stores. The thickness and size of the diced cabbage and length of time with the dressing. Sometimes it is cole slaw other times raw cabbage with a dressing

Chicken and fries done fairly well. Chicken a little dry."}
{"text":"Pretty good menu and service. The Lobster Grilled Cheese is a personal fave!  I don't come here often as I find it's too busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"The low score comes from the server, not the food nor the management! We arrived to the patio to only find one empty table, covered in cold coffee and plates etc. We sat down and waited to be greeted by the server. After a few minutes she came by and said she would be back to clean up the table. After walking past us two more times and forgetting about us entirely I mentioned something and she grabbed a cloth. The lack of service continued for the rest of the night. My dinner guest had an empty glass of water for the entire meal and when the sun set and it got cold I asked if the heater could be turned on. We that is why things went way wrong. Soot starting falling from the heater onto our table. We covered our glasses with napkins but noticed too late to save our clothing. My jeans were stained and my guests pants were as well. The server came over, saw the napkins on our drinks and I guess thought nothing of it. I would have thought she would inquire why we were putting hats on our drinks, I guess she sees that often?! The food came out shortly after that and it was great. About a minute after we got our food another server came by to ask if we were done with our salt. She was focused on her side duties and not so much on our experience. I equate this to putting up chairs or vacuuming around guests that are still eating. We loved the food but could have used a little more in terms of service."}
{"text":"Best example of this chain, I've seen.   Good staff and good, but pricey, food.  The salmon was the star of our choices, but I would get the lunch portion instead of the dinner to avoid the funny mashed potatoes in spring roll wrapper."}
{"text":"Joeys at chinook is literally always busy. Because of the mall?? Probably. But also because it's reliable and the service is great. I've never had a bad meal here. Servers are always nice and friendly. Rainbow sushi rolls, burgers, flat breads...all delish. Oh and the chocolate lava cake is crazy good!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad for a franchise. There are three seating areas but you will want to avoid the bar if you want to have a comfortable meal in which you can actually hear what another person is saying. Service is off and on. Although often you will need a refill or a bill and wait a ling time to get it. I have always enjoyed the tuna tacos when compared to other menu items. The portions are a good size and you will not go away hungry as long as you get a good meal. One thing I really appreciated was my pick up order came in a reusable cloth bag. The restaurant is not easy to get into on a Friday or Saturday evening so be prepared to wait a little for a seat. They often give snacks and drinks to people waiting which is a nice treat. Overall it's a not bad place to go for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I can't rave about Joey Chinook (or the others) enough. Their food rocks, their booths are sweet and I love the atmosphere there.

I went with a friend of mine after we saw a movie at Chinook (Happy Feet 2 in 3D...rocked btw). I got 2 sushi cones, the edamame beans and a few drinks. My friend had the crispy mashed potatoes and the lettuce wraps. The only thing I don't like about Joey is that it takes me so long to order because I have such a hard time choosing which delicious menu item I want to order!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with Joeys this time around.  I just had a baby and she's a fantastic baby, always quiet and just sleeps when we go out for dinner.  Well she needed a diaper change, not only do they not have a changing station you also have to go down steep stairs just to go to the bathroom, I am not sure if that's even legal, they must have a handicap bathroom accessible upstairs because they would get shut down, no?  Anyways, the food was alright, I actually ordered just plain ole' fettuccine alfredo and when it arrived it was like a rose' alfredo pasta with tomatos and blah blah, it was really good though so I am not too upset! but it was 6 dollars more than what I had originally asked for.  Our group all ordered alcoholic beverages and the wait time on those was ridiculous.  The sangria I got WAS absolutely delicious though and that's the only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1.  I am super disappointed though about the kid situation, not sure if they think they are an upscale, classy restaurant that kids shouldn't be welcome, but the owners should open their eyes and realize that they are not better than boston pizza and shouldn't try and target away from families."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I were here last week. We had a great time and great food. Our server was also amazing! 

I had the veggie burger - yum!

My one friend had the market chicken salad (also very good! - my recommendation from having had it before). 

My other friend had the Katsu salad - she said it was also very tasty. 

The atmosphere on the patio is fun and very comfortable.

We also enjoyed the drinks (red wine, the elderflower Collins - which is always a must and a Bellini!)

We didn't sit inside but the renos also look great!"}
{"text":"Went there for the second day of grand opening after remodel . They seemed effortless with the transition . Very relaxed atmosphere for grand opening. Our waitress Amanda who is an ambassador for joeys was wonderful and couldn't have been nicer . Food was great but a little sad that the 500 salad was removed from menu . Ordered it very frequently! But good was great"}
{"text":"Order appetizers if you are Hungry. Their service can be painfully slow. :-)
Joey's is usually a pretty happening and vibrant, especially if you are in the lounge.
And one reason many people go there, is that the servers are usually good looking!
But unfortunately, the service can be Very slow sometimes...."}
{"text":"I am always a big fan of Joey. Well so came here for dinner and I ordered my usual Ahi Tuna Sandwich (its really a burger). It was soo good. I think this one tasted better than the Joey, I usually go to which is in Vancouver. I loved it. I had it with yam fries and the portion of the fries was small compared to Vancouver Joey. Well its its ok. But they were good. 

D√©cor was really nice here. It looked trendy. Good service, good food. Very fun atmosphere to be in. 

We came on a Tuesday night and if you are in the hood for cheap Tuesday movie then you have to come here for dinner. I heard from the server that the reason why Tuesday is busy is due to the theater. Also plenty of parking here. So you don't have to worry about pay parking. 

Just a great place to be."}
{"text":"We went to Joeys for a Birthday Gathering and I had heard the food was amazing.
Unfortunately I was unable to eat anything there, having a Peanut allergy most restaurants are sensitive to this issue and find something they can guarantee is safe.

When I was ordering the waitress repeated ' we can't guarantee this hasn't touched peanuts ', this included the bread, water, deserts, pasta and chicken, you name it it ' couldn't be guaranteed '.

The frustrating thing is no effort was made to find out what was safe, so I starved and watched my friends eat their meals while sipping on water all evening.

It's not a bad place, It's just not sensitive to those with any type of allergies."}
{"text":"To me places like Earls, Joey and Cactus Club are generally somewhere I know I can count on fairly good food and decent service. My last trip to JOEY chinook we had a really lovely server, he split our ravioli on two separate plates (as we wanted to share) without having to ask and even placed the prawns on my friends dish as I had mentioned I didn't want them and my friend would just be picking them all off the dish. 
JOEY is just consistent in my mind and I like that."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special, in the nicest way possible. It's the restaurant that my friend and I usually hit when we're shopping at Chinook or going to see a movie. 

The menu is \"American,\" which is restaurant speak for \"everything.\" They have curries and tandoori flatbreads for offer, in addition to big salads, sandwiches, steak and pastas.

(I once made the mistake of getting butter chicken here. I knew it wasn't going to be good...but I really wanted butter chicken and held out with a faint bit of optimism. They have since taken it off the menu. Don't get anything Indian from Joey's.)

Today, I got the viva salad for lunch, it was actually pretty good. Comparable to a large meal salad that you might get at Earl's, it had cranberries, avocado, feta, chicken, onions and more, covered in a nice honey balsamic vinaigrette. 

I would never suggest that you go out of your way to eat at Joey's, but if you find yourself at Chinook and hungry, it definitely beats the food court."}
{"text":"Stopped here with hubby for quick bite before going to movie at Chinook mall .   Our server was very nice and always made sure to check on how things were. We ordered the hot wings with Franks hot sauce to start.  They were quite hot but my husband really likes Buffalo wings so he was happy with them.  A small side dip of blue cheese dip came with it.  We shared an order of The butchers Sandwich was just enough for us. It came with a small dish of au jus to dip our crusty sandwiches in.  The sandwiches were great but we found the jus was quite salty .  It also came with a generous side of crispy long skinny fries and a little dish of ketchup.  I asked for gravy for the fries , but it was kinda herb like and I didn't like it.   We shared a light sweet dessert Raspberry Butterscotch Bodoni.  Not heavy but sweet with fresh raspberries, a mousse like cream, and salted Carmel cream sauce.  Was nice with our cups of cappuccino served with heart shaped foam designs.  We enjoyed our dinner and  will be back!"}
{"text":"If you want a lively dining experience with good service, the option of watching sports on crisp large screens, enjoying pretty tasty food surrounded by newly renovated digs, this is the place for you. When I say lovely, I mean it's loud. I believe the renos didn't include sound absorbing materials. 

The menu includes a well rounded selection of eats that will surely whet the appetite of most everyone  who is seated.

The attentive service was appreciated.  
The fish tacos are lovely and reminiscent of those I enjoyed in San Diego.  

My partner in crime enjoyed Steak frites; ample serving and steak cooked to his liking. 

My espresso, on the other hand had passed on and left its soul somewhere in the back of the house. 

A few minutes after I ordered it, our server stopped by the table to let me know that my espresso was \"brewing\".  Of course the alarms sounded, but maybe someone was making it for me while she tended to another table....I should've known that when she confirmed my order of a single shot of espresso with \"expresso\", she was not a coffee geek like myself. 

Anyway,  I don't much like to go on about such a little detail like this. However, training is needed when it comes to brewing coffee and pulling shots"}
{"text":"Joey's is Joey's. .. the food is predictable and alright.  It's typically consistent. The problem with this location is the TERRIBLE service in the lounge. The last two times we've gone we sat for 15-20 minutes without so much as a \"hi I'll be right with you.\" So not just bad service, but NO service. Both times we left and went to Chop around the corner and had great experiences.  The last time we actually got service our server was seemingly high... super spaced out, forgetful, and paid more attention to the table of flirty guys next to us. 

I used to work at Joey Tomatoes in Eau Claire so I know the level of service that management should expect, but apparently they just aren't that into it!

I'm rating it 2 stars because some of the dishes are decent, but that says more about the chain than this location. This location has a decent rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Aside from the floor under our table not being the cleanest,  the service was great, the food was tasty and the drinks were flowing."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for lunch. We were greeted by well-dressed, good-looking staff that smiled as if they actually enjoyed their jobs. The dining room has a warm, cozy feeling with nice amber ambient light. Booths are comfortable and there are tables that are very open to the restaurant for \"see and be seen\" as well as several tucked away for a more private experience. The Veggie Burger, though it fell apart somewhat, becoming a more de-constructed interpretation that I ended up eating with a fork - was delish. Sushi rolls weren't masterfully-made or presented, but were fresh, with velvety salmon and a zesty orange topping I couldn't get enough of. Coffee was great too. Servers regularly came to refill our waters, Club Soda & Cranberry Juice and coffees until we had had enough. Prices were very reasonable, around $15 - $20 for lunch items. I would go back."}
{"text":"As far as the Joey's brand goes~ they always try to kiss your butt, so at least you know they have demands to make everything right. 

I'm not a huge fan of their food however, they are one of the only chain restaurants in town that will do Vegan options. Soy is obviously terrible for you when loaded full of GMO's etc...but it is a \"sometimes\" option. 

This particular location kind of looks at you like an alien when you order completely vegan, but they get it right in general. 

Easy place to visit if you don't want to beg another restaurant chain to make your required modifications."}
{"text":"I had a great time there with my friends... Also, the food was very good and the ambience was nice... I would go back there .."}
{"text":"Popped in after work alone for a beer and a quick bite before tackling shopping for the rest of my Halloween costume.  Reason for my choosing Joey's is that I happened to park in that lot and hadn't eaten all day.  I had a bad week and I don't know if that showed on my face or the service is just really that bad.  I'll explain....

Took a seat in the lounge, greeter was over in an average amount of time with a menu.  Gave the impression she was my server so I ordered a pint.  7-8 minutes later, guy in shirt and tie drops it off at my table and runs away.  I look down.  Not a full pour.  Not even close.  Just over half and less than 3/4 full.  Oh well.  I'm parched and really need a beer.  So I look over the menu...look over the menu...have memorized the menu.  Pretty much watched two loops on Sportsnet.  I now know what's happening in the world of sports.  I check Facebook, I check it again.  I peruse Instagram.  Check some emails, wrote some replies in regards to a Kijiji ad.  Found a scarf on Etsy that I favourite and may buy at a later time.

Someone in the kitchen hall catches my eye.  You must realize that when I walked in there were 3 greeters.  I have seen 3 other girls in the lounge.  One behind the bar.  I have no idea where tie guy came from or where he went.  Anyway, they collectively realize that I've been sitting there for quite awhile (and being shy have tried numerous times to do the best I can to flag a server down...haven't quite physically flagged someone but damn near.  When they were around, which was not often).

So server comes over and apologizes...\"oh!  Something something fake nice\" (ooopsie apparent in her voice).  I ask the soup of  the day.  Something not appealing, split pea or similar.  Order chicken souvlaki out of one of those moments when that was totally-not-what-you-were-gonna-order-but-it-had-been-so-long-since-I-decided-that-I-kinda-forgot-what-I-wanted-when-I-decided-a-half-hour-ago.  Kneels at table when I order.  Now I feel weird.  Kind of explains what I'm ordering (green onions...no thanks) and takes order as if I looked like I was going to rage at any second (is this a service tactic for potentially angry customers?).  Yes, I am aware that I have an extreme case of Resting Bitch Face.  But...made me feel strange.  Felt a little weird now for eating alone.  I eat alone all the time, I rarely feel or get treated strangely.  Odd.

Food comes...below average.  Could've gone to Opa and it would be on par.  Probably better.  The two 1/2 and 3/4 pints of warmish beer I'd had probably helped.  The skinny fries suck.  Limp.  Probably called skinny because you stay skinny only eating half your order.  Watery souvlaki, not a lot of love put in to it.

Sigh.  Try harder Calgary.  Why have double the amount of people on the floor when not needed?  Cut your staff down by a few and educate them on proper customer service.  

I guess this is what I get for going to a chain restaurant in Calgary.  I need to make better decisions with my life."}
{"text":"I love this joey's! The Bombay butter chicken is always my go-to and the servers will always bring your dish however you ask for it (extra whatever less whatever, whatever!). I also really love the calamari and the ahi tuna sandwich. You can't really go wrong with what you order here, it's always done well."}
{"text":"I stopped into Joeys Chinook this afternoon with my spouse for a quick lunch. We sat ourselves in the lounge and service was very prompt. However we were more taken care of by the waitress that took drink orders then the waitress that was actually supposed to be \"taking care\" of us. I had a Sangria which was perfectly fruity and very refreshing. My Spouse had the Chicken fettuccini  which was very fresh, and creamy and he enjoyed very much. As a vegan myself I had the veggie burger, sans cheese and sauce. I was pleasantly surprised that the veggie patty had sprouted brown rice and was freshly pressed. It was topped with tomato, pickle, cucumber, avocado, onion, and sprouts. For a chain restaurant this was such a well done veg option that I'll definitely have again! Plus the Skinny Fries cannot be beat! They are always fabulous! This is overall such a great location and I always enjoy myself when I stop in!"}
{"text":"I used to love Joey's! The menu was always great and the staff were excellent.
So naturally I was excited to head there while visiting home!
Nope! 
First off my favourite salmon dish was no longer on the menu. Second, our waiter was so damn pushy! The restaurant was dead, so he didn't need to be so pushy! My friend (who I hadn't seen in 2 years) and I wanted to sit and chat, have a few drinks, order some good, digest and then order more. Well that wasn't possible, our waiter checked on us literally every 4 minutes. After we had our meal (I had the French dip, my friend had the lobster grilled cheese) \"So have you ladies decided on a dessert?\" \"No. Not yet.\" ---this conversation happened 3 times in 10 minutes (let me point out that my friend also told him \"I need to sit and digest, have another drink then we will order\"). But our waiter didn't have patience! So we ended up just getting the bill and leaving! 

Disappointed Mr Joey! :("}
