{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  It's clean and the owners are the most friendliest folks in town.  Plus, free WIFI! Woot Woot!

Zephyr Caffe serves coffee from Italy and it's absolutely divine.   The iced tea is refreshing and nice.  Try their salads and sandwiches. My favorites are the avocado cucumer and cheese sandwich and the tuna salad.  They serve desserts too. Try the Tiramisu or the strawberry cake."}

I had visited Zephyr a couple of times with a friend after our walks along the canal. It wasn't great (unlike The Coffee Shop, at Joe's Farm, which is wonderful), but it was okay. Until yesterday....

I took another friend of mine there after a walk along the canal with our dogs. This friend is 8+ months pregnant, and after the walk, she wasn't feeling great. I waited outside with our dogs while she went into Zephyr ask for a glass of water. The woman in Zephyr (who is, I believe, the owner or co-owner) was LESS than customer service-oriented. In fact, she was downright rude to my friend. We live in the desert. Someone walks in to ask for a glass of water, you give it to  them, no questions asked! This woman slammed the glass of water down on the counter and treated my friend like she didn't exist.

We had been planning on ordering breakfast and coffee once my friend felt better, but when my friend walked back inside to ask about any fruit that Zephyr might offer (so she could get her blood sugar back up to a safe level), again the woman almost ignored her. Didn't look at her when she spoke. Pointed to the display case and said, \"Only apples.\" My friend asked her if she was having a rough day; the woman responded, \"No, I'm not having a rough day. Only apples.\"

It was embarrassing to me, since I'd recommend this place, but even more, it displayed a HUGE lack of customer service. I'll NEVER return to this coffee shop and, frankly, hope that karma is in full swing for this person. We drove to Joe's Coffee Shop (at Agritopia), had a lovely breakfast and coffee, and were served with more than a smile.

Please don't frequent establishments who treat people in this manner.
