{"text":"Excellent food, unique in the best way possible. Try the specials, they rock. This place has a great atmosphere and scratch made food. This is what your Grandma would make if she was Polish and had the chops of a Michelin chef. You will be surprised and will come back. Oh and the soups are exactly what any good polish place would have."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I have been going there for a solid 7 years.  Not as frequently as I like since moving away from Glendale 6 years ago.  The food is always good.  The owners are great.  I'm very happy at the success they have found.  Most of the basics ahve been covered, so I want to add my story.  On our first visit I heard some customers raving about soups I found to sound a little odd.  I gave them a taste and they were amazing.  Since then I like to try the soups regardless of what they are.  This lead me to try the pickle soup when my wife & I took her parents there.  It was close to 8 months later when we came in to visit again, had lunch and asked if they still do pickle soup as my wife was craving it.  Although it was off the menu, they noted that my wife was pregnant and that if she wanted pickle soup then she must have pickle soup.  They asked for a date in the future that we could make it back in.  Found a date where I could pick up a to go order for dinner and sure enough, they put it on the menu that day.  Definitely a rare circumstance when a place will go absolutely above and beyond like this and make you feel completely special.  Just absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Been going here for lunch 2 times day since I was turned on to the place sad part is I work in downtown Glendale but never went around the different neighborhoods to explorer! But back to this place, WOW great food and YES all the food is killer, don't go in there thinking this is the place for a light snack NO! this place feeds you well.  The staff AKA husband and wife are super nice and fun to talk with, don't forget to try one of there cooking classes too."}
{"text":"Very good food. All is from scratch and fresh. Pierogi's are excellent. Serrol soup was new to me and was a pleasantly surprise in how great it tasted. Staff very friendly. If you are not familiar with Polish food, they are more than happy to share how it's made. Will be going back."}
{"text":"When I ate there the service was slow and the food came out just warm. This was after quite a wait. The perogies were very doughy and the filling blah. The sausages had been cooked much earlier and were dry. My group will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I was heading to another highly rated Glendale, AZ restaurant (it was closed so be sure to always check days and hours of operation) when I came across A Touch of European Cafe on Yelp. With some pretty solid reviews in hand, I decided to journey a couple of blocks the the historic part of Glendale, AZ and give some Polish food a try for the first time.  I couldn't make up my mind on what to order based on all the reviews so I decided to indulge and get the sampler platter with Kielbasa, Stuffed Cabbage, Pierogi, and a generous scoop of Hunter's Stew.  I can't compare what I ate with anything because I have never had this type of food before except for Kielbasa.  However, it was EXCELLENT.  The husband and wife chef team scored big with the stuffed cabbage and kielbasa and there was nothing wrong with the stew and pierogi.  Everything is made from scratch and you can really tell that the owners have put there hearts into their dishes.  If you are looking for something unique, put this on your list!!!"}
{"text":"We had sandwiches for lunch which were huge and tasty. Wish they served beer/wine, but still a great spot to sit on a beautiful patio and enjoy the great food and service from this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Oh so delicious!!  Chicken salad on apricot walnut bread is so yummy. Great, friendly service. Sweet interior. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We go here every year during our annual jaunt to Glendale Glitters. It's owned by a very friendly Polish family that always make me smile. One year, one of the daughters had a fake baby and must have been \"playing mommy\" for a school class. It kept crying and the whole family kept taking turns rocking and feeding the baby while acting like nothing unusual was going on. I told you that make me smile!   Every time I go there, I am sure to get the pierogi as it's not to be missed. But please don't go there during Glendale Glitters because it's so hard to get a table during the festivites and I really want to get a seat this time."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer.  I have been coming here for dinner at least once a week, and sometimes lunch, because the food and the service are so terrific.  It doesn't take long to feel like one of the family.  The atmosphere is warm and fun. The portions are huge.  The food is simply delicious!  Try the soups.  I sometimes have two.  If you are lucky they will have the roast pork and sauerkraut special.  Yum!  The cabbage rolls and the goulash are also great picks.  And ask if they have \"Mama's Apple Cake\" when it comes time for dessert.  You won't be sorry unless you are trying to lose weight.  They are only open for dinner a couple of nights a week and it varies by season so call ahead.   It's a small place, and very popular, so make a reservation if you want to be seated without a wait--even for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a real find and I mean \"find\"  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.    My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Definitely a treasure as someone mentioned.  A small peaceful oasis with great food.  And don't forget the dessert!  If you miss mom's or grandma's homemade Polish and other mid European dishes you can find them here."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to not be a big fan of polish food but then my Dad dragged me here and I've been hooked ever since. The Hunter's Stew and the Kielbasa platter are to die for and the service is excellent. I have never been disappointed with this place and plan on making a trip there this weekend. They also do these cooking classes which are a bit expensive but I sort of want to try one."}
{"text":"The most delicious lunch to date! The House Sandwich was perfect and toasty! My hubby goes there weekly and I strongly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I don't think this business wants business.  They close at 7 on a Friday night.  I met up with my party out front at 6:30 (still hot and light out in July) at this place based on the great Yelp reviews.  We walked in and the place is hideous inside you can look into the messy, cluttered kitchen, there are maybe 4 very crappy little (think Winchell's Donuts from the 1970's) tables in the whole place and they made no use of their patio.  The lobby and dining room are the same space.  So needless to say, not really the place you want to meet with friends.  Not even a place you CAN meet with friends, the tables are pretty much for 2 people and there are only 4 of them.    Anyway, being optimists and since we were already there we walked in around 6:45 the woman was rude to us for being there 15 minutes until close.  I guess she wanted to get out of there so we were told she was closing and we could get a to go order if we wanted to stand around and wait.  It wasn't like there was any seating.  I looked at the fat guy and another person sitting around in the messy kitchen and took the rudeness of their upset over how \"late\" we showed up as my cue that we were not really wanted there so we left and ended up at Westgate.  We tried to support downtown and felt bad that we were denied.  FRIDAY NIGHT!!  Any restaurant should at least stay open until 9 on Friday and Saturday or at very least seat until their posted 7 close time.  We should have just gone to Hause Murphy's.  They are open late and down there and have never let me down."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my son there today! It was incredible food. Excellent service, quaint location. Highly recommend them. I had the Hunter's Stew and a side if their beets. Oh my goodness it was good."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and the owners are so friendly. The food is fresh and very comforting. They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own wine and they will open it for you."}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews, I don't feel I have much to add except that you MUST COME HERE!  The food is incredible.  I love the pierogies and blintzes are to die for.  This is seriously good food."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Polish food. I grew up eating potato pancakes and blintzes for breakfast and stuffed cabbage & peppers, goulash and all the rest for lunch and dinner. Also growing up in the Chicago area, I often had access to great Polish deli's and stores. I was very exited to find the \"A Touch of European Cafe\" so close to my newer home here in Glendale.   So to the review...   The service was friendly and had a real homey feel - nice people.   The food was 'pretty good' not quite the same as that which I was used to from all the Polish delis I grew up eating from - in particular, I am used to a coarsely ground sausage, where the one made and served here was VERY finely ground and a Very mild in flavor. So not really my favorite.   Price - Well here I have to say was my main dissatisfaction factor with the Cafe. It was simply too expensive. The combination platter I had was $17.50 and to me was worth maybe $12.50 to $14. And then everything else from a cup of soup to desert and even the apple cider were $3.50 all (especial the cider) were over priced by at least $1 (it adds up). I am always open to trying a new restaurant and will pay prices that may be too high - once - to just see for myself. But as in this case, where I feel the overall cost of the meal of $31 (for one person) was over priced by about $9 - $10 almost a 1/3 (should have been around $21 not $31) I would think twice about returning based on price..   The bottom line, I may go back, the people were nice, the food was OK but, I am going to keep looking for a more reasonably priced Polish food place.."}
{"text":"Excellent Polish food. Very friendly, family owned restaurant. Went with two kids under two and they were very ask welcome. I brought two people who have never had perogi and they LOVED them. Great place. Make sure you BYOB (beer and wine only)."}
{"text":"Such an amazing little restaurant. I do mean little, it's safest to call for a reservation. The food is delicious and authentic. The menu offers many choices. A definite must check out."}
{"text":"Wow best lunch!  Walked in asked the owner behind the counter what to eat and they ordered everything and it was awesome."}
{"text":"I am an expert in eastern European food and I am in love with this place for a long time. My dad took me here a long time ago - I believe I was 12 years old when I first came here. We know the owners and my dad always comes in to chat - they always bring a welcome and warm feeling. The food is amazing. I usually order the same thing (Polish sausage with saurkraut). The only \"bad\" thing about it, is that it's very far from where I live (Scottsdale), but I end up making the drive to Glendale just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant place with an amazing appeal. The service was fantastic, food was quality, and again the patio on a beautiful March day was perfect. Will have to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, and the owners are just as cute as can be! We tried to go to the Taste of Glendale but it was packed and I'm cheap and lazy and didn't want to pay $25 to stand in line. I remembered having enjoyed this place for lunch before so we gave it another try. We'll definitely return. I had the sampler platter (or half the platter actually since it was huge) and my date had the pork goulash. As much as I enjoyed my dish I'll have to say that the plate of porky goodness really stood out. Nothing fancy but very filling and truly downhome tasty (if home is Warsaw I guess). The weather was beautiful so we sat out on the patio w/another couplethat are regulars  and their adorable dogs (oh so European) enjoying pleasant conversation amid the twinkly lights before walking around the neighborhood briefly. Perfect for date night but remember to bring your own wine."}
{"text":"We have definitely found a new favorite place to eat!!! Down in the heart of Glendale, this restaurant is an absolute find!!! We got a sample of the pumpkin soup and was it yummy!!! The owner told us her husband made it for the 1st time last night and am I glad we were there for the inauguration!!! All the food we had, stuffed cabbage, goulash and noodles and pierogies and sausage was excellent. The service was fast and extremely friendly. There's only 5 or 6 tables in this restaurant, so you definitely need a reservation. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I love pierogis and cabbage rolls, so I was excited to visit. The proprietor is lovely, the service is stellar, and we enjoyed our visit. I think there is a Glendale curve in effect for the Yelp rating, however, so my (admittedly high) expectations did not match the food.    Pros: - The food is well executed in technique. The kielbasa is just a little bit crispy on the sides. The pierogis are slightly browned.   - The pickled herring was well done - fishy, tangy, a little sweet.  - The service is quick, efficient, and friendly.   Cons:  - The sauerkraut and mushroom pierogis were bland. I expected more flavor and texture, perhaps tanginess or crunch from the sauerkraut.  - The flavor profiles of the kielbasa and the cabbage rolls were just...boring."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to try something new. Delish! We both ordered the \"combo\", which included a kielbasa and 6 pierogi. We were contemplating the sample platter, which seems like it would've been way too much food, once we saw what the combo came with. Pierogi were really tasty--crisp outside, with a creamy center. Apparently, there are two flavors, but the combo comes with the potato cheese variety.  Situated in an older house on a cute street in old town Glendale, it's easy to miss. Service was good and employees were nice. Seemed like a family owned/operated establishment, which added to the ambiance/feeling in the restaurant.   Desserts a plenty as well. I was too stuffed to partake, but the macaroon looked scrumptious!  Hopefully, they'll be around for a while, because we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this place while visiting family. We saw it had great reviews and the locals liked it too so we tried it. It was definitely worth all the hype. It was delicious and seemed authentic since it was owned and run by a Polish family. When you ask customers there what's good, they say everything so it's sure to be great and it was!!! We tried the \"My Big Fat Polish Sausage Sandwich\" and one of their soup of the days which had spinach, carrots, and potatoes with a hard boiled egg. It was delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxing and beautiful sitting in the shade under the trees. The food is delicious! I had he panini croissant and the hubby had stuffed cabbage... we both licked our plates clean! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is simply fantastic. You must come here and try it. The atmosphere is very European small and intimate. Large patio for dining al fresco and the staff is very caring of your needs. Comfortable and affordable. You will not leave here hungry."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good old fashion Keilbasa and no ladies I am not talking about what is in my new set of pleaded pants.  I am talking about the great sandwiches at this hidden location in the old town Glendale.    The soups selection is great (the chicken dumplings are lovely) and the specials are always a delicacy, did I mention I can bring my own Scotch, bmos?  Classy!    For those of you that like your red wines you can definitely pull out that cork and make love.   Speaking of love that beautiful lady server always brings are great smile and service.  I brought my flute and was ready to make babies but while in the middle of my overture, I found out her husband made all that tasty food.    Well meantime folks come in for a great time for A Touch of European Cafe..  Stay Classy"}
{"text":"Wow..just wow.  This brought me back home to the days my gramma made cabbage rolls.  Everything was so tasty.  Pierogies were awesome...everything on the Polish sampler platter was yummy.  Really nice that you can bring in a bottle of wine..with no corking fee.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes one of my favorite meals of all time; their tomato, mozzarella and basil sandwich.  Each and every time I bite into one, I can't help but close my eyes and get lost in the joy.  Everything about it is perfection, from the freshest warm ciabatta to the generous drizzle of balsamic that balances every last bite.  I've been going there for years now and there's never once been a single variance; it just always blows my mind.  Might not sound substantial either but it will really fill you up without weighing you down.  (Because AToEu is kind of far from where I live, I've tried to get my fix of this sandwich at other closer restaurants such as Pane Bianco, but no other place comes close!)  Whenever I can break away from ordering the sandwich, I also really love the hearty, home-cooked Polish platter, which includes homemade pierogies (not frozen) and homemade kielbasa (tender and flavorful), in addition to hunters stew and stuffed cabbage... all wonderful, warm, and comforting.  Also wonderful and warm is the family who owns this restaurant.  They're a special family, and they make me feel like family whenever I go there.  If I lived closer, I'd be there every week."}
{"text":"The food was out of this world. The owner/ waitress was very friendly and helpful. You better not pass up this place"}
{"text":"A gem hidden in down town Glendale. We stopped here for lunch. The chicken salad sandwich was delicious and so was the grilled cheese my boyfriend ordered. There menu is a mix of salads, sandwiches,  and Polish entres.  We will be back and try this place for dinner."}
{"text":"A quaint, little restaurant serving primarily Polish cuisine.  I tried their \"chlodnik\" soup (cold beet soup, similar to gazpacho), and stuffed cabbage (\"golabki\"), both of which were very tasty.  I was also offered a free sample of their 'cream of peanut' soup, also delicious, and shows you that these restaurateurs can get quite creative and beyond traditional Polish cooking.  They have quite the selection of entrees, sandwiches, desserts and beverages, including the Polish black currant juice, a definite must-try!  They are only open for dinner on Thursdays and Fridays, and on other days it's just lunch, so be aware.  also, it's BYOB (beer/wine only).  There is plenty of free street parking right outside.  And the staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Will definitely visit again next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for a while! I'm just never in Glendale so I finally made the drive out there to try this place for lunch. Service was great! While waiting for my food, the cook even brought me a sample of Beet Soup that he just made to test it. I had the Kielbasa and cheese pierogis and it was great comfort food. The kielbasa was juicy and the pierogis has a great flavor to them. I even used the leftover kielbasa in my scrambled eggs the next day. :)"}
{"text":"Good ethnic food at reasonble prices. Very warm and friendly owners. Small and cozy...feel like you could be tucked away in a small cafe in Europe. Try it, you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Yummy is all I can say. I love pierogi and theirs were great. My husband had the Hunters dinner and loved it (2 meals worth!)"}
{"text":"This tiny place has my attention!  The cabbage rolls are so delicious,  try the sampler platter so try as much as you can in one sitting.  A must for authentic European food."}
{"text":"Not very often do I crave a nice polish meal but this past weekend the craving hit me solidly and I suddenly found the urge to get some perogi smothered with sour cream  and no I'm no pregnant nor have the proper organs to be carrying a child. So I went with a friend to this cool little place near downtown glendale. The day was cold so sitting outdoors was out of the question but the outdoor seating looked like it would be perfect on a warmer day. Inside the place was, dare I say, cute, quaint and cozy.   The food was delicious. I had Perogi and white borsht. At the end of my meal the craving was satisfied and I could go on living. The owner and staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"PICKLE SOUP?  At first, I was dubious. I am not really a fan of pickles, but the waitress highly recommended it. I tasted it, and fireworks burst in my mouth. There were savory, herbal and sour notes in the soup. It was robust and rounded. We also enjoyed tomato and barley beef soup. We enjoyed the pierogi, goulash over noodles and grilled Polish sausage. This was a surprisingly delightful cafe that is a must when you come to Glendale square. PICKLE SOUP? YES, PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere and the food was just wonderful. Only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 stars Is because the service is slow and they are not busy, I didn't get a single refill on my coffee or water until I asked just as we finished our meal."}
{"text":"this is probably the third restaurant i tired in Glendale, AZ...It is located in a historic site in Glendale and all the houses around it are also little shops that sells antiques and trinkets. The restaurant has a very cozy and homey touch and a nice little outdoor patio seating area.  The inside of the restaurant is quite small...maximum capacity is about 25. We sat by the door and since my bf got a little cold the really nice waitress moved us further in the restaurant. The lady who served us might also be the owner...but she was very friendly and nice.  So I ordered something called the Combo...it came with 6 potato-cheese pierogi and a smoked kielbasa sauteed with onions. OMG the smoked kielbasa was huge! it was at least 9 inches!! =D it was also very yummy! the potato-cheese pierogi was a little bland by itself but dab a little bit of sour cream on it..it was pretty good. I really enjoyed my dish and I was close to finishing it but since the waitress gave us some bread and butter, I got pretty full.   My bf ordered the smoked Polish sausage on a roll ciabatta with cold sauerkruat slaw. It was also very huge..and looked really yummy too. he also ordered a cup of cream of potato...which i  thought wasn't creamy enough but was still okay.  The entrées are a bit expensive per person...average $14 but if u order just a sandwich with water then it's about $8.  Another thing about this place that might be cool for those who drink is that you can bring your own beer and wine without charge. =D  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and service. She made a mistake on the bill...charging us $33 instead of $27..she was nice and apologetic about it so we tipped her more. =D I would love to come here again!"}
{"text":"Chocolate moose pie amazing . Sample platter a winner great taste great food wonderful service  Had the polish sample platter with hunter stew. Best meal ever!  Had buckwheat beef soup. Amazing fresh flavor,  Best restaurant in Arizona"}
{"text":"Small little polish cafe that has big flavor! The service was incredible, our server was so sweet and hilarious! Kielbasa and pierogis? Yes please! It was brought out within 5 mins of ordering. The pierogis were huge, stuffed with potatoes and cheese, super filling. The sausage was enormous! It was smoked to perfection and it was so juicy. Never been a fan of spicy mustard but when it was presented with the kielbasa, I couldn't turn it down. It was the perfect combo! Prices are fair, atmosphere is great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had a pierogi craving and this place hit the spot.  Our waitress (who I assume is one of the owners) was wonderful.  Very pleasant, helpful and polite.  She was sure to make us feel welcome, which I liked.    This food was exceptional.  Stuffed cabbage was excellent, bigos was delicious, and pierogis were the best!"}
{"text":"My wife said the pierogi's were some of the best she had ever tasted.  So good that she got an order of 12 to go.  I tried the Hungarian pork goulash and it was very good.  Big portion.  Couldn't finish it all even though I wanted to, but I got some for later."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!  Homemade Pierogi is my favorite. This little restaurant in a small house is run by a husband and wife. They are really nice and welcoming. The food tastes fresh. The atmosphere is pleasant, with indoor and outdoor seating.  Definitely check this out!"}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant. They have good polish food (I notice a lot of european nationals come here - I recognize the languages). They are small inside with 5 tables, and a large patio area (this is the historic Glendale area).   The best part may be the atmosphere. The service is unique. Some places are more ...um, comfortable, than others -this is one. But here it's like visiting family for dinner. Don't be surprised at getting drawn into \"intra-table\" conversation.   So I've been before. And I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"So good...Quint essential remedy for when I'm having a bad day. Cold beet soup is perfect on a Phoenix night."}
{"text":"What an amazing hidden treasure! It's like being in my grandparents ' house and enjoying a homemade meal. The pirogi is outstanding and the home soups are so flavorful.  Makes me feel like a kid again."}
{"text":"Stopped by today with the wife.  It's always a favorite place to eat when we're in Phoenix. Menu has enlarged.  Food is, as always, magnificant."}
{"text":"i liked this place. small inside located inside old town glendale so it looks sorta cute food was gooood! got the sampler combo cause i didnt know what to get and the cheese and potatoes pierogi were yummm!!  recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a sourpickle soup. Was pleasing. As a Latvian I even didn't know what to expect from that. Although I tried also the barley, beef and mushroom one and it seemed even better.   Had pierogi both with sauerkraut and mushrooms and potatoes. Both were fine but boring. They were not real dumplings but dry fried pies served with too thick sour cream.   However tried also the sauerkraut and it was very good. Also the super unhealthy sausage that comes with it.   The cabbage rolls were plain and not worth to try.   They served espresso in a very beautiful cup."}
{"text":"Gosh I love this place!! Stopped here for a late lunch when I was by Downtown Glendale, I'm so glad I did! My friend and I had the Kielbasa and pierogies which was about $14. It was a huge potion so I took half of it home for dinner. We also shared a slice of carrot cake, which was also fantastic. I did love the atmosphere, I felt like I was in someone's house for lunch. The serve was friendly and helpful. If I'm ever in this area again I'll go back."}
{"text":"Perogis! Yumm! I grew up in the upper midwest surrounded by polish communities and miss sweet sweet perogis. The kraut and mushroom ones are really good and 1/2 doz is a perfect serving size for lunch.  The atmosphere and the people make the cafe very comfortable.enjoy."}
{"text":"Great little spot... cozy patio and amazing food! The menu offers basic items and some delicious favorites as well as some new Items we haven't had before. We started with a hot pickle soup!!! Oh so yummy! I had your basic egg salad sandwich but it was huge, and delicious! I could only eat half! Hubby enjoyed a sampler platter, cabbage roll, perogies, hunters stew and kielbasa .. He enjoyed every bite! Our daughter ate an Italian sub, which that too was a large portion and also very satisfying! Expresso, Lattes and desserts... we were all satisfied! From start to finish the service was great too! We'll be back! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I am not of a European food conisour but this place is amazing.. the owners actually work here. I love the atmosphere here. When you walk through the gate your taken to a little cade. The ambience is perfect. The staff is friendly and the food...omg the food is fantastic! I highly recommend this cafe is you want European food. The pierogies are cooked to perfection and I don't think I've ever had smoked kielbasa cooked as well as here. If your near Toth and glendale...check them out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Today was a good day. Yelped this place and had the Braut  sandwich. It was served with spicy mustard and sour kraut. Delilah to say the least. Outside seating and quant with Plesant staff. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but.. well.. let me explain.    I came in on a Friday around 5:15pm trying to catch an early dinner. I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had \"reserved\" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy.   The restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise.   The food is best described as \"home cooking\". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland?   Overall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good polish home cooking, then this place is for you.  It's not personally my style, but it was still pretty good.  The service was stellar.  I can see why they get so busy.  The owner or server was very friendly and accommodating.    I ordered the goulash with pasta a green beans.  It was pretty good.  The portions are quite large.  My husband had sampler dish.  I would recommend to those looking for comfort food."}
{"text":"Being of Polish descent but not really being in touch with my Polish side, I was really excited about this place and wasn't disappointed. The food was great! I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch and delightful conversation and service on Christmas eve while visiting from Los Angeles.."}
{"text":"A Touch of European Cafe is a well kept little secret of Glendale Arizona. If you enjoy Eastern European fare, or just want to try something new, visit this small, picturesque cafe, which is located on a charming and quiet side street within the historic square of Glendale. Weather permitting, dine at the outdoor patio under mature shade trees, where you may feel as if you are no longer in the desert Southwest. This is a place where you can casually relax with some quality authentic food in a quaint, possibly romantic setting. Tip: Call ahead about their Sour Pickle Soup... you do not have to be pregnant to develop cravings for this unusual yet appetizing soup recipe!"}
{"text":"A great little gem in Glendale.  This is the 2nd time I have dined here.  They have a great outside patio along with their inside dining.  Everything is made from scratch including the bread.  They have 3 different homemade soups and daily specials. The portions are large.  I shared the fresh mozzarella and tomato (add some prosciutto) sandwich with my mom and I didn't go away hungry.  They have all sorts of desserts from cake to cookies."}
{"text":"This food really is fantastic. The specials are always delish. Their meatloaf is to die for. This is not your 'normal' meatloaf. It's always been perfectly cooked and seasoned, with a good amount of their gravy.   Their mashed potatoes are of course very good. Always topped with onions and some paprika. Was their for lunch yesterday and the chef came out and gave is tasters of his Sorrel Soup. Wow! It was explosive with flavor! The Pork Ghoulash tastes just like my grandmothers, whose parents were immigrants from there.   All in all its delicious, and they're extremely friendly. The wife is the waiter/hostess, husband is the cook, and they're both friendly, can't go wrong with this shin dig!"}
{"text":"The Touch of European Cafe is a quaint little place in one of those old homes that have been converted into a business just off the Historic Glendale square.  This place is locally owned by a couple of immigrants from Poland. They offer fantastic tasting Polish food and have exceptional customer service.     Now, I'm not a \"beet\" person so when I was asked to sample their red borscht-beet soup I was apprehensive to the point of making a grimmest face. But to my surprise it was delicious! We ordered some soup de jour, pierogi's both cheese and smoke sausage with onions for apps.  These pierogi's were amazing!  The best I've had in quite some time.    Since it was lunch we opted away from the delicious looking Polish Plate Specials and went for their gourmet sandwiches.  We had their Fresh Mozzarella, basil and tomato on cibatta bread toasted with their vinaigrette dressing.  It was very fresh and tasty. We also had a smoked polish sausage on a cibatta bun with their sauerkraut-slaw and mustard.  It too was very good and huge! We had to take half of it to-go. They have a lot of homemade deserts to choose from including Cheese Blintzes and Kolaczki Cookies, which we had both the apricot and raspberry ~ delish!!  The Touch of European Cafe is very small and popular so you may need to call ahead of time when dinning indoors for dinner.  They have outdoor seating which is perfect for dinning for lunch of dinner when the weather is nice. They are BYOW so you can bring your own favorite bottle of wine!    We are looking forward to our next visit, this time it will be dinner.  Planning to bring a nice bottle of Pinot Noir to go with either some Hunter Stew or some Stuffed Cabbage Rolls along with a side of pierogi's of course!  I might even have their soup de jour again!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife came back on 3/07/2015 for her birthday. This time we brought our two sons. We have been telling them how great this place is so we had to have them see for themselves. Me, my wife and one son had the Chicken salad sandwich, {This is my third time here, and I have had the chicken salad every time.} Once again, we all believe this to be the best we have ever had. My other son had the Egg salad sand which, and of course I had to try his and he had to try mine, and we loved both. Now the chef  here always makes a few homemade soups and each time you can get a different soup. Today we had the Borch soup and the tomato with rice and basil. CRAZY good!!!!!!! The great thing here, you can have a taste of all soups to see if you like them, and then you can order the one you like the most. The owners like I have said before, are so very nice and make you feel very comfortable. We will be back in April, {we live in Gilbert, long drive but worth it} I will try to try something different, but I won't make any promises. Woo Hoo!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I've only had the pierogies, but I've had them about ten times. It's about half an hour away from my house.  That's how good they are. The woman who owns the place is so friendly and sweet. I really like her. It's also BYOB.  I'd love to bring a bottle of wine and sit outside on their patio, eating pierogies. (Ok. I have a problem.)"}
{"text":"Went here last night and had a great experience. Our server (who I'm pretty sure was one of the owners) was extremely friendly and helpful, the food was unique (maybe not in Poland, but in Phoenix) and delicious, and the atmosphere (we sat on the front porch on a beautiful evening) was very enjoyable. And maybe the best part: it's BYOB! We brought a bottle of wine, and as soon as we walked up the sever grabbed wine glasses and bottle opener and made sure we could get started.  We had a sampler plate as well as pork goulash. Our favorites out of everything we tried were the perogies (buttery potatoey goodness) and the cabbage rolls. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A group of us enjoyed lunch in August. We really enjoyed the food. Some had the large portion of cabbage rolls, while had a half of sandwich left over. The bread was freshly baked and they serve coke in the bottles as opposed to the fountain drinks. The wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions. Oh, the carrot cake was large enough for the entire table plus the best ever!!  Definitely will be back with the wife some evening soon since they are open until 8:00pm.  Also, The air conditioning in the hot day was much appreciated."}
{"text":"It has been 2 years since my last review of one of the best restaurants in the valley. I drive and hour to get here and it is well worth it. It is located in the historic district of Glendale. Small, quaint with the owners running the restaurant. I have never had a meal that was not outstanding, best soups ever, different every day. One of the owners is the chef and he is a genius. wonderful sandwiches, salads, and authentic Polish food. Homemade pirogues are to die for. The sausage is flavorful and will make you want more. They ever offer cooking classes. I have learned  a lot of tips from taking the classes and you get to eat the meal at the end. This place is a must. If I could give it a 10 I would."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place. The best food and great people. One of my favorites for any occasion!"}
{"text":"If you need a reason to go to downtown Glendale, this is it.  A Touch of European will remind you of a small lunch spot in large urban cities surrounded by tall buildings even though it is in a small cottage in the middle of downtown Glendale.    The menu is mainly Polish, however it does have many other \"touches\" of Europe.  The tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwich melts in your mouth.  The cibatta bread is perfectly baked on site and the balsamic vinegar sauce is downright perfect.  I still have not been able to figure out how they make the sauce.  It is not your standard reduction.  Also try the stuffed cabbage.  Again, the food just melts in your mouth and is very filling as well.    There is patio seating as well as seating in doors.  On a nice day, I recommend sitting outside and enjoy the serene world of downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Great service and great tasting Polish food. Downtown Grlendale area. Prices are a little high but worth the try.  Able to buy desserts to go. Also BYOB wine or beer. They will supply glasses for you."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Authentic polish food and they owners are so friendly and awesome. Talk about good stewardship. I've tried every single sandwich and every single one is good. The husband cooks and the wife waits the tables. They also have a plethora of soups , changing theme every week. The white borsch is great, the tomato soup is the best I've had anywhere. Yeah, we come here every week :)"}
{"text":"Glendale is where I live and work and I like to try everything in the core downtown area.  I have had this restaurant on my to try list for some time.  The really good stuff: The place is really cute.  The service is really great, Margaret works very hard at making you feel at home in the restaurant. I could tell by the way regulars are treated that if you go often you are family.  The OK: The food is well cooked and presented.  I had the sampler plate($15.95) with 2 cheese Pierogi, Kielbasa, stuffed cabbage and hunter stew.  The so-so: I prefer more of the fat to be cooked out of my meat.  I make my mid day meal during the week to be my big meal and many of the dishes I did not try are not that large.  Price wise I will not keep it in my regular lunch rotation.  General commentary: I was asked if I wanted lemon in my FBIT and I still got it.  The butter served with the nice warm bread was rock hard and not near able to melt (this can be tricky as there is a range that refrigerated products are allowed to be held at room temperature).  I may still go back again as it is different and not bad and I would be happy to show it off to another person.  Of the food I had I would reorder the stuffed cabbage and the Pierogi.  Based on what I saw I would also like to try some of the soups."}
{"text":"8 of us went on the Saturday afternoon to celebrate birthdays.  I called ahead for a reservation, I hear the place is small and gets packed.  I should have bought the GPS, but I thought I was going to use my sense to get there.  Circled a little and found out the street does not go through the Glendale library is in the way!  LOL!  We ordered 12 pierogi (mixed).  They are so so SO good.  We ordered sandwiches, sausages, cabbage wrapped something, etc...  Everything was so delicious!  Loved the atmosphere of the owners interacting with the customers."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place? I have probably been here a hundred times in the last 8 years. The food is amazing, the service is wonderful and the patio is very dog friendly.. need I say more? This is one of my staples to go to in old town Glendale. Go. Now. Just go.. and it's a BYOB."}
{"text":"First of all, the atmosphere here is amazing. The patio is quaint and quiet and a great spot for lunch (and they allow dogs). The service was phenomenal and perhaps most importantly the food was great! We got the sampler plate that came with hunter stew, peirogis, kielbasa and a cabbage roll. It was plenty of food for 2 people. The cabbage roll was the best thing on the plate and I would definitely get an order of the cabbage rolls as an entree next time we come here."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, and always the food was delicious, fresh and clearly well-prepared. Folks are really delightful, atmosphere is appropriate for the cuisine. I noticed that there were some \"regulars\" there, which speaks well of any place. On a return visit, I asked for lots more onions, and they showed up, no additional charge."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a cute little place in historic Glendale. Beautiful little tree-lined street and a lively patio. I had the tomato mozarella sandwich and tomato noodle soup. Both were very good. I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was better.  The atmosphere is quaint and very relaxed. It was incredibly authentic and family oriented. Our waitress had a European accent  and was working hard to keep our 2 yr old entertained with cookies and by drawing her pictures. Heads up though, it's BYOB!!"}
{"text":"Charming restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. The service was friendly, efficent and flexible.  My sisters had large tasty sandwiches for lunch.  I had the polish sampler.  So worth it!  Everything on it was fabulous.  Fresh tasting and perfectly spiced. The hunter's stew, pirogis, cabbage roll and sausage are to die for.  It is served with addictive spicy mustard and lovely dark bread...I used it to sop up the tasty juices."}
{"text":"So if your looking for a great place with really good polish food, an incredible outdoor patio under shade trees, and very friendly staff, this is the place to go. Food was prepared fresh, deserts were excellent. A little pricey, but only for the large plates. But you do get your moneys worth.  It's a little out of the way, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I had the goulash and my husband had the kielbasa. The sausages were so tender and delicious. I am going to have to come back soon because I am regretting not ordering the sampler. I want my own sausage and I am dying to try the cabbage roll and pierogi. I'm staring at other customer's plates longingly. The carrot cake was also amazing. The owners are super nice. Really a great meal experience in every way."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner last night.  Not only was the food excellent but the owner was just so sweet and personable.  We shared a few specialties so we could try a variety.  Cabbage rolls, pierogi, kielbasa and goulash all were wonderful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went in on a whim while I was downtown. Didn't know it was only Polish till I sat down because the name denotes all of Europe, and not just Poland. The menu also didn't have a lot of European foods on it, just a few desserts and borscht. There was only one waitress (the owner) and it was really busy due to a lot of special events going on in that area. They really should have gotten some temporary help as I waited a long time to even get a drink and she just kept telling people to sit down \"if you're going to stay\" but then you ended up waiting forever, wondering if you were even noticed. I got a turkey and cranberry sandwich on ciabatta - not really European at all! - and while it was a good size sandwich, it only came with a small bag of Lays and a pickle spear for $7. Way expensive for something I could have easily and cheaply made myself. They wouldn't let me get just half a sandwich and a bowl of soup for a set price (\"We don't do half.\") which would have been a lot more satisfying to both me and my wallet. The tea - a Polish brand fruit herbal tea - was really good and decent priced. They also had a few Polish brand items on a shelf you could buy (I bought a box of the tea for only $2.99).  For the service and the prices, I won't be back (around $15 for a sandwich, tea, and a box of tea that took over an hour to get and eat... no bueno). Decent sandwich and cute house, but they need to rethink their menu a bit before I'd even recommend this place, much less come back."}
{"text":"I don't think it gets any more Polish than this in Arizona--at least I haven't found a place that does.  Coming from a predominantly Lithuanian family with relatives married to Polish people, the food here reminds me of Sunday afternoon family get-togethers in terms of authenticity and taste.  The spot is very, very small, so you may have a wait.  The menu is also very small and specialized.  But what they serve is delicious and will not leave you hungry (or broke) when you leave.  Their desserts are phenomenal.  If I lived closer, I would probably be here quite a bit more often.  Very heartening to see a family group all working together to make a business run!  As for the review that mentioned a \"crappy attitude\" - Baltic people are very direct and no-nonsense, and don't follow the American way of attempting to \"sugar-coat\" everything.  So while that may surprise some people, it doesn't this particular Lithuanian."}
{"text":"I've never had Polish food before so I can't make an informed comparison. That said the food was quite good and the hospitality was above and beyond. great place to eat"}
{"text":"This place was so cute and fun, came with some friends and had a blast!! Food had great taste I will totally be coming back here."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a beautiful spring day with a group of friends.  We sat on the patio, it had a nice breeze, soft modern music in the background, and it felt like eating at home.  Now onto the food.  At first glance at the menu suggests that it may be out of a student's budget, but there were plenty to choose from for everyone.  I ordered the breaded chicken breast filet with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut-slaw-salad.  It was excellent and very tasty, and tasted like a homecooked meal.  I was never a fan of sauerkraut, but after eating it here changed my mind (mix of apple slices made it more refreshing and sweet).  Chicken breast was tender on the inside, and crunchy on the outside.  Mashed potatoes were very flavorful with caramelized onions and topped with paprika.  A friend also let me try his smoked kielbasa and potato-cheese pierogi...which were both very tasty.  Portion size is exactly what you paid for and will feed you well.  Very personal service and they have eyeopening desserts as well.  I will go back for sure to try more!"}
{"text":"Great home cooked meal. Nice outside dining and friendly family run business. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Never had polish food in my life until this awesome place! I lived most of my life down the street from here and I'm disappointed that I didn't know about it sooner! Service was outstanding and our food was deliver quickly! It's a little gem in downtown Glendale for sure! I will be back to try more of its menu!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here for our Anniversary lunch...and, we were not disappointed.  We shared the pierogi's (OMG!  They're so amazing!!).  Hubby had the cabbage rolls again, and he loved them as much as he did the first time he had them.  I went with the turkey and cranberry sauce sandwich on a croissant.  It was very, very good!    And, as always, the service was friendly and attentive.  This place just makes us smile!  :)"}
{"text":"Love love love EVERY single thing about this place! The food, the atmosphere, the people, and the owners! Felt like home!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed everything.  Cute little place, pleasant service, yummy Polish food.  I will be returning.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that one of my two lunch partners thought the food was too bland.  I would argue that he expects everything to be overly spicy and therefore doesn't appreciate anthing else.  But...since he wasn't as impressed I decided to achnowledge his opinion.  They took our lunch reservation and had a table held for us which was awsome.  It is a tiny place so I would recommend reservations so you won't have to wait."}
{"text":"Worth the drive to Glendale. Some of the best Polish and eastern European food I've eaten stateside. Everything was delicious. Wonderful ambiance. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant  gives you plenty of good Polish food and you will not leave hungry!  I ordered Pierogi's which were potato and cheese filled.  They were sautéed in butter and browned on one side and had a bit of a crunch which was wonderful.  Also, I got the smoked kielbasa and the skin snapped when being cut with a knife and was so juicy too.  My wife got the sample platter which had potato Pierogi's, 1 stuffed cabbage, fresh stuffed in house kielbasa, hunter's stew which is similar to sauerkraut.  She said everything tasted wonderful, just like her grandmother made.  Before the meal, toasted rye bread and butter was served.  The only down about this restaurant was that all the soda was served canned, therefore we ordered iced tea which had free refills.  This is a pet peeve of mine here in the States, but in Europe it is usually a standard.  Otherwise, I would have given this restaurant probably 5 stars."}
{"text":"To experience Historic Downtown Glendale I'd put this little restaurant at the top of anyone's list.  Great homemade Polish food with a very inviting atmosphere.  This is a family run place at its best!  Located on a quiet street in a row of older homes the uniqueness oozes from the inside and out.  It's very small inside with only about eight tables inside and maybe three outside.  So they don't serve to a vast amount of people.  With that said there is plenty of interaction to be had with the waitress.  Which is one of the main reasons to check this place out, she is great!    Make sure to call ahead to see what their hours are as they are not open at all times for lunch and dinner.  Quite expected for this type of place.  I know I'll be back and would suggest for anyone else to check it out as well if in the area."}
{"text":"This is a gem! The soups are scrumptious. My new fav is the chicken salad sandwich on the apricot bread. Save room for dessert. The Napoleon is perfection. The restaurant is BYOB."}
{"text":"Goodness, if you want to try something new and delicious give this place a shot. First off, the location is pristine, especially on a. Nice day. Quaint little cafe in a nice neighborhood. Friendly staff, great recommendations, delicious food. Great place to bring a date!"}
{"text":"Great food , wonderful service!,,,    I come from Chicago and know good Polish food, this is the place!   A hidden gem.  I ordered the combo plate, it came with 6 Pierogis and a good size piece of smoked sausage.  I was able to order 3 of one kind of Pierogi and 3 of another. Along with bread and a small bowl of the chicken paprikash soup , I was done for the day!   Great service and everyone in my group enjoyed their meal.  The owners are very nice people and really work hard at producing a good meal at a reasonable price.  Ignore the bad reviews about being overpriced! This is quality homemade food and who ever writes bad reviews must be used to fast food garbage.  It may be a little more expensive but it's good!   If you need to complain about prices then go to your fast food hang outs.   Definitely a place to try if in Glendale, I drive 45 minutes to go there."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I came here for lunch while visiting friends in Phoenix, and this lunch was delicious.  I had the hunter's stew with kielbasa, and the kielbasa was one of the best I've ever had.  Very tender, flavorful, and as the name suggests, the dish was very generously portioned.  Served with stewed pickled cabbage over noodles, this is a very hearty, filling dish.  We ordered some potato pierogi's as an appetizer-- if I had known how delicious these were, I might have ordered a bunch just to have as my meal.  Fantastic pierogis, delicious sauce.  We dipped bread into the leftover sauce on the plate when we were finished.  My friend ordered the stuffed cabbage-- this was also a delicious dish, very flavorful, and not quite so heavy as the hunter's stew.  I would easily come back here for another meal if I find myself in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Really wonderful polish restaurant in a cute bungalow. I was looking forward to the soups and pierogi my fellow Yelpers recommended. I started with a cup of the cold buttermilk and beet soup which was served with a sliced hard boiled egg. It was wonderfully smooth and tart. My part Polish friend had the warm pickle soup which was also delicious and authentic. She also judged the sauerkraut mushroom, and potato cheese pierogi to be just as good as her grandmother's. I got the combo platter which also came with a huge kielbasa, the best I have ever had.  We also opted for chocolate mousse cake and poppy seed cake for dessert. The portions were really large and too much after our dinner. But good nonetheless.   I am new to Polish foods, but I can't wait to come back. I was really torn on whether to order goulash as I have a relative who makes a mean version at home."}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints! What can I say that hasn't already been said here?  Outstanding, delicious homemade food! Excellent service! Generous portions! Reasonable prices! The BEST homemade soups!  Be sure to eat here if you are in the downtown Glendale area.   Margaret & Waldemar are the owners. Margaret waits on tables and Waldemar is the chef...the food, portions, and service are just as consistent today as it was when they opened years ago.  Your first visit WON'T be your LAST!  FIVE STARS!!!"}
{"text":"We catered for an event. Everyone was super happy with the food and they have a good assortment of polish food mostly."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!! The atmosphere is fantastic; small, intimate, the owners talking to customers like friends that dropped by for a cup of coffee. The variety of food was intriguing in a way that will please groups where not everyone is a polish food enthusiast. Everything is fresh, home made and tasty. The quality of the food: pierogi: B+, delicious, but I make a pretty good pierogi too lol. Kielbasa: I had the smoked, and I give it a solid A. I may try the fresh tomorrow ( yes I'm going back tomorrow...). The Golabki: A+++++. So good I took some with me for dinner. I am from out of town, here for a week for business, and I only wish I had found this Monday. I travel 48-50 weeks a year, and finding Places like this is the best part of my job. This is what I call a \"DRM: Death Row Meal\".  If I ever find myself on death row, this is a meal that I would request lol"}
{"text":"This little Polish restaurant tucked in downtown Glendale is authentic and warm. I went for lunch and had the tomato, basil, and mozzarella sandwich, which was outstanding! Next time I go, I will try out some of the more \"polish\" dishes such as the sauerkraut and sausages.  It is only open a few evenings a week for dinner but it is BYOB or bring your own wine..a hard to come by perk in most Glendale restaurants."}
{"text":"By far, this is my new favorite in Phoenix!  The flavors are authentic and warming with unparalleled hospitality.  I can't wait until my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Make sure you call to make a reservation.  It can maybe hold 25 people maximum inside. Yes they do have outside seating, but it can get cold during the winter.  Even with the outdoor heaters going.    I like the home feel of the place, I felt like I was eating inside a friends home.  The food is the same as it is comfort food.  I felt very satisfied when I left.  The sample plate was great and gave me an idea of what the food was like.  I did enjoy the service, nice home feel of the place, and the food.  If you want to try Polish food in Arizona, this is the place."}
{"text":"A delicious lunch. The pickle soup was amazing. The perogies mouthwatering, topped off by my favorite childhood comfort food, a black and white cookie, which until now I had to go back to New York for. Love this place"}
{"text":"When food is offered from love, an understanding of flavor and the intertwining nature of the ingredients, it transcends good food and takes on something that isn't easily found in the Phoenix valley.  It becomes great.  Wonderful people making and serving delicious food in a simple, home style setting make this my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here last night it was so much fun.  The owners are a polish couple who keep the place very immaculate!  The atmosphere is fun .  I counted there are only about 7 tables in the entire restaurant but there is seating outside.    The meal starts out with some pumpernickel bread and butter which was very tasty.  We ordered the beet salad it was fresh and not over bearing when it comes to pickling.  For my dinner I ordered the house special which is sort of like a pot sticker with meat.  But they put a polish spin on it which had a butter sauce and bacon bits followed by sour cream.  She had the cabbage rolls which were very large.  The plate comes with three.    We shared our meals so we could get a taste of everything.  For dessert we had a tipple layer chocolate tart which had a chocolate cherry filling.  It was so gooooooooood!     The menu mostly consist of polish food.  Its a very neat place if you want authentic polish.  This was the first true polish meal I ever had and it was fantastic.  Prices were great for a Friday night.  Two drinks two meals a salad ,  bread and butter , and dessert came out to 30 bucks!    Cant beat that.  Plus the food was homemade.  The place itself is nestled in downtown Glendale its a little hard to find the first time but trust me its well worth it.  It almost feels like eating in someones house.  Very fun very different.  Try something new and go here.  And you also feel good because you just supported a local mom and pop business!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place to have a birthday lunch.  I enjoyed everything about this place. The location, owners, and of course the homemade food.  We started with a Pierogi Platter (1 doz), three different types: potato-cheese with smoked kielbasa saute with onions, meat, and sauerkraut.  I love the meat and potato-cheese, not so much of the sauerkraut ones.  I ordered a smoked polish sausage on cibatta bread , so yummy!  As for my friends, they had a fresh mozzarella, basil & tomato on cibatta,  hunter stew, cabbage roll, and breaded chicken breast  cutlet & cheese on cibatta bread.  I will need to go back to try the cheese blintzes.  Another plus about this place was   B.Y.O.B. - (beer or wine only)..  This was certainly a hidden a gem in downtown Glendale!"}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place. We saw a newspaper write-up and decided to try it out. This small restaurant is in an attractive setting--great outdoor seating, live music the night we were there and fantastic staff.  The food is delicious--I had the potato and cheese pierogi and kielbasa sausage, my hubby had their 'Hunter Stew' (a cabbage and sauerkraut and noodle yummy).  They brought a small, free sampling of the evening soup special (dill pickle--a true polish tradition) and loved it.  We split a chocolate-dipped coconut macaroon for dessert and found it outstanding---not too sweet and large enough to share. Lots of other items on the menu will call us back. Seating is limited inside and it was too cold to sit outside the night we were there, but we didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I liked this place and would've liked to try more than just pierogies. I did order kielbasa as well, but it didn't come out, and she didn't charge me for it, so I didn't argue. This is a really cute restaurant, with great patio seating.   I hand make my own pierogies (which I am not entirely bias to, I always am on the lookout for someone who can do them better). A Touch of European Cafe's are about a 6. I think they were a touch undercooked and a bit too greasy for my liking. The farmers cheese that they use in their potato is wonderful, and I think I will be trying that out the next time I make mine. Their sauerkraut were good, but lacked depth.   Overall, I think that this is a great place to come to, and probably doesn't have much competition as this is the only Polish restaurant that I know of."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Loved eating outside as it was so quiet on this little nook like street the cafe is on. Soft music playing in the background and mild AZ temperature made for a great dinner. This was our first time going, but certainly not the last. Grade: A++"}
{"text":"A Touch of European Cafe in Old Towne Downtown Glendale has a delightful atmosphere.  The restaurant is housed inside a bungalow home in Catilin Court Historic District. The patio is very charming and relaxing during times when the weather is nice.  The restaurant offers many traditional polish dishes and other European dishes. The restaurant also offers a small selection of special imported food items to purchase.  You can enjoy dining at an authentic European family run business.  The food is tasty and house made.  I had a meal from the favorite daily menu.  It was a chicken dish with leeks, green chilies served over noodles with a side of green beans.  I enjoyed the flavors of the entree.  It was a harty meal. Also, they have rotating daily soups that are usually very good and filling if you get a bowl."}
{"text":"Smoked Kielbasa, Pierogi, great soups, sandwiches and salads. This relatively small place is one of my favorite places to go, relax, and have some great Polish food. On top of this the experience is heightened by the friendly face of one of the owners Margaret who serves you. Her husband Waldemar who does the cooking will call out a welcome and loves to come and talk with you when he has a chance. When the weather allows the patio is wonderful. So don't just sit there, go get your Polish fix."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a mom and pop restaurant. Their whole family runs this place. They are very friendly and accommodating, they will take care you. Plus this is the only Polish food I've been able to locate, aside from Stanley's who specilizes in sausages.   The restaurant is located on a quiet street in Downtown Glendale. There is a patio with trees towering overhead. It makes for a very peaceful lunch, and for a moment almost makes you forget you're in a blistering desert. They do have limited hours so make sure you call ahead of time.   I have been here twice, and both times were excellent. My friend's mom (who is Polish) made me Pierogi when I was young, and ever since I've been hooked. I had both the potato and cheese and the meat Pierogi. Altough I prefer a little more butter and onion with my Pierogi they were still delicious and cooked perfectly. Next, I had to Golabki (stuffed cabbage) which was even better than the Pierogi. They were moist and filled with plenty of flavorful meat, and topped with a sweet and tangy tomato sauce. The Goulash is also amazing, but I can't go into detail on this one since I had it on my first visit.   I highly recommend A Touch of European Cafe. I wish I didn't live so far from this place! Its rare that I get to fulfill my Polish cravings."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Every dish I've ever had or any of my family has had was amazing. We get lunch here 4-5 times a month, sometimes more. Great daily soups as well."}
{"text":"We got our Polish food fix here! Yay!! The stuffed cabbage was simply amazing! The homemade kielbasa was pure Polish love!! The cheese & potato pierogi were just sooo good! We took home some home made dark rye that was baked to perfection! Another hidden gem in the desert!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Wonderful Fun Place to have great homemade Polish food cooked and served by the family and eaten in the kitchen or out on the patio. The father husband chef butcher makes the juciest tenderest Kielbasa ever.  Full range of Polish Food--excepy no Kishka.  And do not order the green beans if not fresh; ours were canned."}
{"text":"If you like food that is truly authentic and exceeds your expectations, that this is a great place to sit right down and dig in. The owners are first generation immigrants from Poland you might think you are sitting in Poland if you while you dine. We ordered the kielbasa platter and the combo plate. The brown mustard really complements the kielbasa. The combo includes potato cheese pierogi which I really enjoyed. With the owners doing all of the food preparation and service, you feel like you are sitting around their kitchen table. We really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Can't say more than what has already been said.  A warm, cozy place. With fresh, homemade food. I'm not polish, my husband is, and we both loved it. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Service: Amazing  Food: Delicious  I would recommend the cabbage rolls or the pierogies. Two of my favorite things growing up and they do them well here. It makes me feel at home. Plus the people that work there actually seem as though they love their job. You don't get that everywhere. Which is another reason to support local businesses."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and Margaret was very attentive and sweet. We purchased some sweets and pickled beets too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Mozzarella Sandwich is the best sandwich period.  The freshness of all the ingredients, the tang of the dressing and the ciabatta bread, oh the ciabatta bread, are a combination I would never have thought of but I am very glad they did!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful! The cabbage rolls and the pieroge are delicious.  Pastries and desserts are great too!  Nice, family owned place.  Small selection of speciality items from Poland.   Always reminds me of family to visit this place."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken salad sandwich. The bread was really quite good. I do not usually like apricots but i enjoyed the bread that had baked into it; apples, walnuts and apricots. The servers were very nice.The restaurant is very small and in an old building in the historic area of Glendale. I adore old restored houses/cottages. The only negative is the place is a bit pricey for lunch. Maybe it is a better place to go for dinner? 19 dollars seemed a bit much for a sandwich lunch and a drink. I do want to go back and try the Perogies though."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for a couple of years. It is always a pleasant outing. The food is always good and the service is great. We almost always get one of their sandwiches which comes with chips and a pickle. Their tomato soup is maybe the best I have ever had. Only had it once as it is available on certain days. If you luck out when it is on the menu by all means get a bowl. Highly recommended."}
