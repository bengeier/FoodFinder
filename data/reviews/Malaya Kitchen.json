{"text":"Always excellent food and service. My boyfriend and I eat here on nearly a weekly basis and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Roti Canai is a dish I order every time. Really tasty and one of the best I have tasted. 
Tom Yum soup, Nasi Goreng, the malaysian fried rice as well as Curry Laska are all equally good. The curry laska is an enormous dish that can easily be shared.The Singapore Rice Noodle is okay, not one of my favorite dishes here.

The service which is good, fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It's tucked away in the arboretum shopping center. The food was fresh and delicious. Best Tom Yum soup I've had in the area. Service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we discovered this gem. I've been there three times in the past week and ordered a different dish each visit. Everything I've eaten has been spectacular.  The Indian pan fried noodles were amazing and the portion huge.  I had tofu curry for lunch and the curry sauce was identical to authentic Indian curry that I had while in India.  The Pho Tai soup was flavorful and the portion generous.  The the service is great too!"}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing. Mongolian beef is crazy good ! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  Spring rolls tasted like they were frozen - all mush, no fresh vegetables.   Pad Thai was a pile of mush and a weird pink color.   Not worth the price.  Didn't eat half of the stuff I purchased.   Will not return."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte last month. I was so excited when I found there is Malaysian restaurant in Charlotte area. Whenever I go to Malaysian restaurant, I always order Char Kuey Teow. It's a popular noodle dish in Malaysia. When I lived in Raleigh, I have been so disappointed because good restaurants in Triangle area that offered that noodle dish were closed (Fortune Palace, Penang, & Merlion). With a great expectation, I decided to make a trip to Malaya Kitchen for lunch last week. 

The restaurant is located in the busy shopping center. Kind of remind me with Cameron Village in Raleigh. The waitress was very nice & polite. I ordered Char Kuey Teow, & I was so disappointed. It was just Ok. The authentic Char Kuey Teow usually comes with shrimp, squid, sliced of Chinese sausage, fish cake, chives, & bean sprouts. Mine only came with beef, bean sprouts, & scallions. There was no taste belachan in that dish, which is the key ingredient in Char Kuey Teow. 

Sighhhh.... I guess I have to make a trip to Atlanta if I want to enjoy delicious Char Kuey Teow. The service was good though. I give them a second chance, so I will come back to try other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Malaya food.  I been going to the location on S. King dr.  Since they close down, I been coming here instead. I love the blissful noodle and satay tofu."}
{"text":"Simply the best General Tso's Chicken I've ever had!  Spring rolls were great as we'll.

This will become a favorite lunch date spot for years to come!"}
{"text":"Our party of 6 enjoyed our dInner at Malaya Kitchen. Each dish was freshly prepared and uniquely spiced. The roti canai was flaky without feeling greasy. The service was attentive but not intrusive. We're looking to going back."}
{"text":"Authentic Malaysian food. The roti telur taste exactly like the best one in Malaysia. Curry laksa is also very good."}
{"text":"I went here based on a Yelp search and was really blown away. This is in the back corner of a sprawling strip mall, but really worth checking out. The flavors are great, service quick and inexpensive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Charlotte, my sister took us to the Malay Kitchen. Very friendly and efficient service, delicious food. For three of us, we had the Malay Roll to start, followed by Basil Chicken and Coconut Prawn plus rice.  Fresh ingredients, full flavor, vegetables cooked al dente.  Coconut Prawn had mild coconut flavor - more savory than sweet. All dishes were very satisfying. Although we were quite full, we ordered the fried ice cream to share...it was perfect!  Definitely will return to try other dishes on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Heard good things so invited friends to join us. Restaurant was about 25% full. Ordered the pot stickers which were only fair compared with several other nearby restaurants. My dish, Chili Chicken, was OK, not the best we've had, but full of fresh ingredients. My wife ordered a shrimp pad Thai and specifically ask it be only mildly spiced (3 witnesses here).  The waitress, on her first rerun asked how everything tasted t"}
{"text":"Looove this place.  Delicious Malaysian food near Ballantyne? Who would have thunk?! I love having a neighborhood joint that can always be depended on to satiate my cravings for char kway teow, curry, and belacan sauce.  Malaysian food is an amalgam of Thai, Chinese, and Indian influences and Malaya does all of these dishes very well.  Tip: if you want to crank up the heat ask for a side of belacan sauce.  Add it to everything if you can stand the pungent, spicy, shrimpy hotness.  It will give you special powers.  Or just really funky breath and a sheen of sweat on your brow.  Either way, it's good.  

Try: chicken meatballs, roti canai, tom yum mee hoon, chili garlic duck, mee siam, curry laksa, char kway teow

If its on their specials menu, the spicy stir fried clams with chicken is a crazy fusion of flavors and texture.  It's awesome.  Order it. 

This is a small, casual place with friendly servers.  Inexpensive, consistently great food."}
{"text":"In the year since we moved to Charlotte, this is my favorite Asian restaurant.   I had the Beef Rendang which exploded with flavors in my mouth, wow!"}
{"text":"Great new place for South Charlotte. We had Malay roll, Malay pan fried noodles, and veg curry. All very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a really good find in the Arboretum! I have a gluten allergy and they are good about meeting my needs. I really enjoy the Satay and the Char Kway Teow. Beef & chicken are both yummy. Their food is consistently good and I would definitely recommend them for a casual dinner, date-night, dinner with kids, or takeout."}
{"text":"Last Saturday my husband and I were \"cruising the town\" looking for a bite to eat. We noticed about 5 or 6 different restaurants along that side of the Arboretum. Most of the places had their menus on the outside and nothing really appealed to us. This place kind of had a cool looking sign so we walked in and asked to see a menu. The ladies at the front of the restaurant were so welcoming. We decided to go ahead and stay for dinner. My husband ordered a ying ling... and they served it in a \"COLD GLASS\"  how awesome is that?! For an appetizer we got the crab ragoon, which I have to say was excellent. Normally from take-out Chinese places it's usually frozen and deep fried on ordering. These weren't the usual triangle crab ragoons that you see at most places, but the blossom ones. Super Yummy! They serve them with some duck sauce. 

For entrees he got Mee Goreng which he loved. I thought it tasted like there was some dill in it. Not a big dill fan myself, but he loved it. I got my favorite which of course is a Pad Thai. Very yummy. Their Pad Thai is very plain though not a lot of extras. The food was delicious and we'll be back again for sure, but I LOVED the service!! 

Those ladies bust their butts to make sure you have a great meal. You have to love eating at a place that values their patrons that much."}
{"text":"In full disclosure, I have only had one thing here. The malaysian lo mein, spicy, with shrimp. It's so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else. So sad but true. However, my husband has had several things from here including the curry duck which really was amazing (i tasted it). He also likes the pineapple fried rice. Good food but not much for atmosphere. I usually do takeout."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place based on the reviews.  Started with the Popiah, a spring roll.  We chose to have ours fried.  It was just so-so.  Then had the curry chicken.  Not much depth to the flavor.  Curry gravy, chicken and cubed potatos.  Not that interesting.  Finally, we had the Mee Goreng, an Indian noodle dish.  Again, not much depth to the flavor.  We had ours with chicken.  There were pieces of fried tofu in there.  I enjoyed this dish but it was not that interesting.  This was the best dish of the evening.  Finished with the mango and sticky rice.  This was so-so as well.  Would go back and try the soup and other authentic malaysian dishes but was pretty disappointed that i was not more flavorful tonight."}
{"text":"I am not from Charlotte NC, so when my wife and I came across this place it looked like any asian fusion place I haved been to in the passed. But the food here was so so good. The heat level was just right for my taste which is pretty hot. My wifes dish was very good as well. I had Rendang beef and would come back just for that dish again"}
{"text":"Today my wife and I and our son and his wife and both or our grand daughters went to the Malays Kitchen for lunch after church.  It was really good for the most part.  I strongly recommend the chicken with vegetables with the fried rice.  The won-ton soup was also pretty good.  Service was good, everybody was friendly.   The place was also very clean.  Reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Yum! We went here on a whim tonight, and we will be back. I ordered the egg drop soup to start. My husband ordered a beer, and it was served in a cold glass. They appear to have beer and wine with a nice assortment of domestic and imported Asian beers. 

Our entrees were excellent. The meat was incredibly tender. I could cut my chicken with a chopstick! We had the beef with garlic sauce and King-bo chicken. Entrees were delivered to the table less than ten minutes after they were ordered. 

We dined in, but they seemed to do more of a takeout business. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here at Malaya Kitchen is amazing. I have enjoyed every single item that I have ordered, and I have visited this restaurant numerous times. The food does not take long to be ready, and the service is very good. Interior and ambience could be better, but the food and service is amazing. Pricing is relatively moderate, but I would recommend eating here from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., which is when they have lunch special each priced below $9. Also, the Mongolian Beef is my favorite dish. I would highly recommend Malaya Kitchen."}
{"text":"Could not be happier! 
Service A+ waiter took his time and gave me great recommendations, and our drinks were never past half empty 
Food A+  fresh, streaming hot and oh so delicious. Most memorable dish of the night was the vegetable curry, had like 10 different veggies in it. 
Atmosphere A we were here on a slow night so we had the advantage of a quiet dining room with very little hustle and bustle"}
{"text":"Worst food is an understatement... I have eaten here a couple of times in the past - it was never great but a meh type of place where you can do a take-out when you are lazy to go anywhere else...
But last night the food was horrible.. I would not even eat it if it were free food...
Roti Kanai was horrible .. the roti was hard as a rock and the curry was so like yellow liquid...
same thing with Roti Telur.. they didn't even fry it well... you can taste the rawness..
the pot-stickers were not steamed right - you could not only taste but see the raw dough !!!
Beef Rendang - that came as a nightmare.. so spice.. no flavor.. as if somebody made it and poured a glass of water on top it !!!

I am so disappointed with the food ...this was my last time there.. 
 I should have guessed that this place has gone downhill when I went to pick up dinner on a Friday night and there were just 2 people in the bar and none sitting and dining !!!

Save your money and go someplace else !"}
{"text":"I would consider this place as home away from home. 

Customer service - Excellent
Food - delicious

Must haves:
Fried rice 
Roti canai - appetizer
Beef rendang
Triple delight

If you haven't noticed already, they are CLOSED on MONDAYS"}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month and get the same thing everytime!  I love the Char Kway Teow with shrimp, the noodles are delicious.  My husband thinks his General Tso's chicken is the best, with just the right amount of heat! The service is always friendly and prompt. The food is always served hot. It's a little gem of a place tucked away in the Arboretum!"}
{"text":"Disappointment only because the flavors were excellent and the rest could have been.
I ordered takeout as my wife was working late.
The curry with shrimp for me, and the basil dish with beef for my wife.
The shrimp had a soggy breading (yuck where'd that come from!) and my wife's basil based dish had fatty lumps of bad beef. Usually a fan she couldn't eat it.
The vegetables and flavors were fine but the proteins were very much not.
An expensive price for a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Food was lukewarm, seemed reheated. I must say the food lacked flavor and ingredients. We will not return. We ordered 3 entrees and I would add they were all mediocre at best. Only thing we liked ok were spring rolls. 
 We don't complain either, but the food value was not here."}
{"text":"Coming with a NY palate for great food, I can say this place is really good. It's located in a shopping center with many kinds of ethnic foods. I had they're Roti Canai and it's excellent. I also had decided to try their Mongolian Beef. I am used to getting it which is really good from PF Changs, yet they beat them out by a landslide!! My picky son who barely eats anything loved their Pho. This place has good food and I do recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Last night we had a great meal at Malaya. The roti with curry sauce and pan fried potstickers were excellent. I even saved the curry sauce to put on my rice. We also had pad thai which was just ok and Mongolian beef which was fantastic. My issue is that we had a party of 3 and we used a $5 coupon and they wrote in an 18% tip on our receipt before they brought it to us. The service was great and we would have tipped at least that much but it was not disclosed anywhere that there was an automatic gratuity. It's a reason not to go back as they are deceptive in the way they charge and that usually carries over to being deceptive in other areas of their business!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Asian fusion food! We had dinner & the service was wonderful! Sharing the roti is essential--curry sauce and flatbread--imagine if naan and tortillas had a baby. Warm & fresh & scrumptious! Then I did appetizer for dinner with wonton soup and dumplings, both were delicious. My friend had the mango tofu entree with an orange sauce and it was incredible! Sort of sweet & spicy & citrus all together. We shall return!"}
{"text":"A cozy restaurant with authentic malaysian cooking. Great service and quite affordable."}
{"text":"The waitress was Chinese and she was so helpful and I ordered orange chicken and fried noodles I think the fried noodles is a better choice and it's pretty good and I will come there to eat more Chinese food ' the single in the restaurant is bad I can't call in side and the wifi won't that good I suggest to eat near the door"}
{"text":"Continues to be of my favorite Asian restaurants in Charlotte.  Great food and plenty of options for meat-eaters and vegetarians.  Tom Yum soup will kick a cold away.  Our go to apps are Roti Canai and the Lettuce Wraps.  Our favorite entrees are Basil Tofu, Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, Crispy Sesame Tofu and Mee Goreng Noodles."}
{"text":"Malaya kitchen was amazing it was very authentic and reminded me of my time in Singapore. The Laksa was superb I asked for fiery hot and they happily accomodated me, my wife had Laksa as well and of normal spice and she loved the Laksa broth. I highly recommend Malaya Kitchen"}
{"text":"Been here once for lunch on a weekday and thought the food was tasty and portion was just right. Quick and efficient service as well.

Definitely will be visiting here again... I will follow up with a more detailed review once I explore Malaysian cuisine more."}
{"text":"I was pretty DEVASTED when Cuisine Malaysia closed down. Where else was I supposed to get my Beef Rendang and Roti Canai?? Luckily, a little sign on the door led me to its sister restaurant (aka Malaya Kitchen aka heaven). I quickly looked up Malaya Kitchen on yelp (of course) and that's where the adventure began! I had a couple of foodie friends in town and this was the perfect opportunity to try it out. 

foodie friends + late lunch + first time = family style!

We ordered (takes a deep breathe) roti canai (malaysian crispy pancake and curry to dip), beef rendang (malaysian staple: tender beef pieces marinated in exotic spices and coconut), sarang burong (ring shaped fried taro topped with shrimp, chicken and veggies in brown sauce), curry laksa (egg and rice noodles in coconut milk curry) and mee goreng (stir fry egg noodle in red mild sauce with mixed veggies). Rarely does this happen, but I literally recommend EVERYTHING that we ate. Craziest part? Dare I say I enjoy Malaya Kitchen more than I've ever enjoyed Cuisine Malaysia (I KNOW, I'm sorry!). Every time I write a yum review, I reminisce the meal all over again... and now I'm craving Malaysia food!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim and it was fantastic.  Our waitress was very nice, great about checking in on us, keeping waters filled, etc.  The food came out quickly and the portions were very generous for the price.  The pineapple fried rice with chicken was awesome.  The Beef Rendang is probably one of my favorite dishes and it's just delicious here.
We've also gotten carryout and the food is equally as good and they do not skimp on the portions.  
FYI, when I recently went to pick up carryout, there was a sign on their door stating they will no longer be open on Mondays as of 05/19/2014."}
{"text":"In the middle of the Arboretum, surrounded by Chili's, Wal-Mart, and the Gap, this place is a nice and unexpected Asian restaurant. It's received some pretty great reviews. Creative Loafing gave a nod and recently the Charlotte Observer included it in a map of ethnic eats (just a side note: the map's a fun little resource for finding foods of every background). The digs are nice, and while the accolades are good, I didn't find it to be something to write home about.

We got Char Kway Teow (pan-fried flat noodles) with vegetables, which had a deep pork flavor, topped off with grilled vegetables and bean sprouts. I'd love to find out how to make it. Thai food fans will like the mee goreng, a spicy noodle dish with chicken. It's topped with chopped peanuts, has a nice crisp taste from garlic and bean sprouts, and leaves your lips buzzing with spice. I liked a few bites, but it was kind of oily, and my eating subconscious kicked in: \"Mr. Werner, there is too much oil here.\"

The service was the best part: the staff were very friendly and chatted with regulars who stopped in to say hi. I also really liked this giant painting of a Malay town on the wall to the left of the entrance.

I'd like to try out Cuisine Malaya, the other Malaysian restaurant on the list. I liked what I tried, but I want to seek out an even better option."}
{"text":"Malaya Kitchen is exactly what the Arboretum needs, a restaurant that isn't vanilla.  I saw the ad in creative loafing and it spoke to me.  So I wanted to go check it out.  A  modern restaurant, the portions are generous, $8 lunch specials. The waiters are all friendly and helpful.  A great little find to get your Asian on."}
{"text":"On this visit, we had the chicken satay for an appetizer and thought that the peanut sauce was pretty standard. 3.5 stars. 

I wasn't feeling very adventuresome when it came time to order dinner, so I just got an order of chicken pad thai.  It was good, but not the best pad thai I've ever had. 3 stars. (Locally, I prefer the Thai House or Thai Orchid for this dish.)

David had the coconut shrimp, which is breaded and served with your choice of brown or white rice. It also comes with a side of veggies - broccoli, carrots, etc.  The veggies were lightly sauteed and not overcooked.  His was definitely the more exciting of the two dishes, visually as well as in terms of taste. 5 stars. 

I would definitely like to come back and try this place again.  I have heard that they have other dishes that are not available on the \"standard menu\"   and I will  definitely ask about that on my next visit! 

Service was fast and efficient. 4 stars. 

I thought the prices were average - appetizers ranged in price from $2.95 - 7.95.  As for the entrees, you can find a lot of options in the $9 - $13 range, but they have several specialty dishes that run between $14- $18 each - certainly reasonable prices for dinner."}
{"text":"Oh, Malaya Kitchen. How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good. 

A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately. 

For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal. 

We started out with the Roti Telur. \"Pancake\" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!

My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce. 

I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate. 

Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy! 

The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department. 

Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Malaya Kitchen is one of those great spots that I would be missing if it weren't for Yelpers! Thanks all! 

Malaya Kitchen is a wonderful little gem in the Arboretum.  It's cozy and comfortable and the servers are so helpful.  You can tell they love explaining their dishes to newbies.  

My hubby and I had the Malay Roll - it's seasoned ground chicken rolled up in tofu skin and deep fried - it's served with a sweet-chili sauce and it was delicious.  It reminds me of a Chinese-Filipino dish, called Kikiam, I grew up with and it brought back some really nice memories.  We also had the Hainan Chicken  - it's poached chicken served at room temperature with the most amazing rice! And last but not least, we had the Char Kway Teow   - pan fried noodles - oh my - so good.

Can't wait to go back! And their hours fit folks who tend to eat late - they close at 11:00 PM Mondays -Thursdays, at 12:00 Midnight on Fridays and 10:00 PM on Sundays."}
{"text":"I miss the Malaya near Elizabeth. That was always a nice treat and also a great meal before a concert at The Visulite. 

But, I've heard they are related somehow and the recipes are the same. I also like that they have my favorite Beef Redang. 

Employees are friendly and helpful with making choices. The restaurant is clean and nice looking inside. 

I'll visit this place many times."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The Taiwanese beef noodle bowl is my favorite but we've have the Singapore noodles and different chicken dishes and they've all been great."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Asian food in South Charlotte.  All the veggies are fresh and that is very apparent.  The quality of the food is outstanding.  My husband loves the Sesame Chicken and I love the Chicken Pad Hingpan.  Not sure if I spelt that right.  Honestly, the environment is quite simple and the prices are a bit high, but the staff and food are wonderful.  I only wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had their General Tsao's and really enjoyed it. Good quality white meat (not the fatty nuggets other places serve), perfectly streamed rice and veggies, good portions, and a great price. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good menu to select from. At South Charlotte one really good option for Asian cuisine. Very popular among Indians (veg or non veg) who like their Indo Chinese and other Asian cuisine.
If living in and around Arboretum area, then it's a must to try once."}
{"text":"Okay so I live practically behind this restaurant and late Sunday night we were going to see Iron Man 3 at the Cinebarre and we were too early. So instead of waiting we decided to eat at one of the local places. Malaya Kitchen had amazing reviews so that's where we ended up. Since we didn't want to eat too much or take too much time we decided to try 3 of their appetizers. We had the Malay (Chicken) Satay; pot stickers; and the Malay Roll.  So first things first the pot stickers were just okay. They were too under cooked for my taste. I like a good sear on mine and these did not have that. They were large and well stuff (the filling has chicken not pork) but again just okay for me. It ranked in the middle for me as far as the dishes go.  I didn't really want to order the Malay Roll but my friend wanted to try them... he however didn't read the description very well and didn't realize they were wrapped in tofu skin. I'm not a tofu fan, like at all, but I decided I'd give it a try as I'm always open to new things.  He really liked them, I however did not!! The sauce that came with them was good though, actually all of the sauces with each dish were amazing. First turn off was how it looked (really unappetizing although I won't tell you exactly what I thought it looked like haha). Otherwise it just wasn't something I liked, but like I said my friend really liked it so it's purely a subjective point of view. They didn't make it poorly I just don't have the taste for it. Lastly was the Malay Satay which is probably the best I've had in a long LONG time. It was by far both of our favorite dish!

The staff was extremely nice and attentive especially considering we came in an hour before they were closing.  I will definitely be coming back to try out their main dishes and re-review!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I completely enjoy several dishes here. However, tonight I ordered several appetizers for my myself and I was very surprised they were mediocre and had little taste.
Very surprised and disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG! We live in the Steele Creek area so we stumbled upon this place on accident while hungry and in the area for another reason. I will definitely say this, I will drive the 14 miles to eat there any time. The noodle soup that I ate made me weak in the knees, it was THAT good. Also, usually when you tell a restaurant you would like it EXTRA spicy, they wimp out and bring you something vaguely resembling spicy, but not this place. We said make it super spicy and the waitress said, \"how about medium?\" She talked us into going medium and bringing more chili sauce in case it wasn't hot enough. Thankfully we listened. Medium is PERFECT, and by that I mean very spicy! We loved it!

Amazingly wonderful food, exceptionally friendly and attentive wait staff and seriously very reasonable prices. We will go back a million times, we were THAT pleased."}
{"text":"This review should stand as a testament to the good taste of my fellow Charlotte Yelpers and the integrity of their reviews. If Malaya Kitchen and the reviews they've earned here are representative of Yelp as a whole- and I think they are - then the system works! So feel free to pat yourself on the back, raise a self-congratulatory glass of local micro-brew and allow me to explain.

When I came here about 2 years ago for dinner with my mom, we were NOT impressed. I remember the service was amateurish and the food was as bland as Norwegian cuisine adapted for recovering stomach surgery patients. But I'm a strong believer in second chances, especially if, as was the case then, they're new and still working out the kinks. Two years and 4.5 stars later I figured they must be doing something right. It just so happens they're doing just about everything right!

A couple weeks ago I went with my girlfriend and mom and we all left very happy. For starters, the service has improved considerably. But the food is where the greatest progress has been made. My mom got the Basil Flavor Chicken. While not the first thing I'd order, the chicken was very tender and flavorful and served with a generous portion of vegetables. Well worth getting if you can't handle too much heat. My girlfriend's Curry Duck was likewise, colorful and full of flavor. I think the duck should've been a bit crispier. But if your food is gonna go soggy, I can think of a lot worst culprits than coconut milk and spices. 

As for my choice, the Curry Laksa...my god. I want to live in it! It's a gargantuan bowl of vegetables, noodles and your choice of meat in a spicy coconut curry broth. I suspect tyrants and despots the world over may just find the answer to hunger strikes in its heady aroma. All the lofty, idealistic political or religious goals in the world would just melt away with one intoxicating whiff of this otherworldly stuff. I only fear I'll never have the willpower to order anything else."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place on and off for the last one year! The taste has amazingly been the same through the time. Not really crowded and good for a quiet dinner. Must try the roti kanai and roti telur. Good seafood options and love the cilantro clams."}
{"text":"The food here was decent, but I wasn't impressed with the roti canai here. I usually go to a Malay place to eat that, as I don't know how to make it at home.  But here it wasn't as flaky or like I have had it before.  The rest of the food is decent, not something to rave about.  

I think they have a mix of Thai and Chinese food here as well along with Malay but not really the best Malay place that I have been too.  I was hoping for a better Roti if not anything else."}
{"text":"Maybe because I have worked in and out of Malaysia, but my wife and I were disappointed. the food was nothing special and they appear to be trying too hard by adding Japanese and Chinese dishes to the Malaysian.

Service was very nice.  Prices were OK, in fact cheap which accounts for the rave reviews.

Would not come back.  Gave it three stars because most people will not know just how badly they do Malaysian food."}
{"text":"Very unusual for a restaurant at the arboretum. 
Definitely a keeper!

The good:
- authentic Malaysian food
- nice variety in the menu
- Singaporean beer
- very attentive and friendly staff

The bad:
- Chinese music
- couldn't try all"}
{"text":"First time here... friendly, attentive, quick service and most importantly, delicious and fresh food. If you are looking for something different than the traditional Chinese food... definitely put this place in your rotation. Malay food is delicious! Get the Malay roll as an app... you will not be disappointed! (We ate too fast and forgot to take food pics)."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh food.  I had the Curry Laska and ate every  bite and going back tomorrow for more.  Super clean.  Nice variety on the menu.  Service was adequate."}
{"text":"I agree... Not just the Arboretum, but Ballantyne area in general needed a more authentic Asian restaurant, rather than the fluffy \"chain\" type spots. This place is the \"sister\" restaurant to Cuisine Malaya in downtown near CPCC. So the menu is VERY similar, minus the sushi. Honestly, I heard the sushi is VERY good there, but I have only tried it once (and it was good). I cannot keep from ordering teh main dishes- and these are almost all the same at Malaya Kitchen, as Cuisine Malaya. Great food and service. So happy to be able to get their good Malasian food close to home!!
Try the Char Kway Teow (like Chow Fun), one of my favorites. Oh, and the crispy or Curry duck!!"}
{"text":"Love Malaya Kitchen! I eat here ~twice a month. Char Kwey Tao (sp?) either beef or tofu is my favorite. We always have special requests (no this, extra that...) among my friends which they happily accommodate & get all the details right. Tuesday nights also have 1/2 price domestic beers. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Lunch special last Sunday: Chicken meatballs with Ginger and Scallions $6.95. YUMMY. In spite of what the owner says it's not hot, not even mildly hot! But very tasty and mildly sweet  ( I hate too sweet food ).

What can I say, next door at the Charlotte Cafe there was a 100 blue hair seniors waiting for a table. Age does not always equate with wisdom. LOL!"}
{"text":"I had the Mee Goreng with chicken and it was very tasty. I would recommend this dish to anyone who loves Asian food. The Indian pancakes with the curry dipping sauce were really good too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian restaurant. Service is fast, food is fantastic and the staff always gets my special order right. I have a couple of \"go-to\" items, but my favorite is the vegan Tofu with mixed vegetables. If you like spicy, they can heat it up! Prices are very reasonable. 
Highly recommend. We visit at least once a week."}
{"text":"The place has an amazing selection of Malaysian, Indian, Thai and Chinese fusions. Good selection of asian beers and real fine service. I'll highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been back three times so far and tried something new each time.  I have left satisfied each time.  I can recommend the curry and the Pad Thai as fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the few Malaysian restaurants around the Queen City. Very vegetarian friendly. The Veggie Hot - n - Sour Soup is to die for! Family owned and operated. Great service!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and efficient and the location is absolutely wonderful. If you're craving Asian fusion and you're near the Arbo, definitely stop by!

I've only ever gotten the pad thai here and to be honest it was a little too sweet and too artificially red for my personal taste. However, given the paucity of Thai choices in the area, this is a decent place to get your Southeast Asian fix!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a hidden gem tucked at a corner in the Arboretum Shopping Area. It's clean and has nice ambience. I ordered Curry Laksa and Roti Canai,and enjoyed both."}
{"text":"The two-star rating is for the food only.  This is really Chinese stir-fry disguised as Malaysian food.  The vegetables are mushy and the food is oily.  Some of the spices are in there, but not all, so your beef rendang will not taste like it should.  It tastes okay--it's not bad, but it's more like a stir-fry imitation of what the dish should be, not the original, and it shows.  
The servers were friendly, the place is clean, the prices seem fair, the location is convenient with lots of parking, and we were waited on promptly.  No complaints.  The decor is standard to any Chinese restaurant.  And they have a nice-sized bar in there, which is good.  People in the restaurant business are on their feet all day and work really hard, so I don't like to leave less-than-positive reviews.  If you come here without expectations, you'll probably like it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite asian restaurants. Try the Mee Goreng (Indian Pan fried noodles)
...It is very good. Don't be afraid to order it \"Extra hot\" if you like a bit of spice!!"}
{"text":"Man, my Asian peeps can THROW DOWN with the food here! Good lawd!!  I had this place book marked for awhile and my newly graduated from 8th grade son and I looked at the menu and pics on Yelp of course and he decided here.  Great choice, cause, damnnn, it rocked!  Now, I'm dieting but I tried a tiny bite of all dishes and can personally attest that the food was very very good.  The fam gave it 5 stars with no hesitation as well.  

Location is fine; in a popular large strip mall called Arboretum but must say when they designed the parking spots imo, they are a bit tight,  but still, its a good area and parking is ample. 

The restaurant interior while not very expansive is overall fine and seating layout is decent enough so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of each other. The bar takes up a fairly large part of the interior. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful.  They clearly answered our questions on the dishes and checked in and topped us off appropriately. 

The fam started with the \"roti canai\" app which is a simple dish with a single large piece of fried naan served with a side coconut curry.  But the flavor of the curry was far from simple, it was Excellent.   The curry was not sweet,  just very flavorful with the requisite coconut taste. The main dishes were 1) Mongolian chicken, 2) General tso chicken,  and 3) Char kway teow stir fry wide rice noodles.  All were delish and the tastes exceeded what the eyes initially conveyed.  It was shark eyes all around!

Overall the restaurant takes indian/thai/chinese flavor traditions and offers dishes that embody combinations in an otherworldly \"fused\" way.  We wholeheartedly suggest that you try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Very happy about my recent Doordash meal from Malaya Kitchen! I had not been there in a couple of years, and saw it on Door dash the other night. It was really good! And having it delivered was outstanding. So we ordered the  Roti Canai for an appetizer! So wonderful a Indian Style Bread/pancake with a delicious Curry sauce! I wish I had gotten two ! Then I had the Spicy Cilantro Chicken, it was thin slice of chicken in the most delicious Cilantro sauce ever !! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! Really spicy and Really good! We ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice-Nice and light with basil and Pineapple in it. Very good choice  My Sister is a Vegetarian and she ordered the Sesame Tofu, She loved it! It was crispy and delicious! Can't wait to try more of their delicious food..Love the Fusion!!"}
{"text":"The food is real good and not pricy.The service is also good.i have tried below food items all are delicious.
Kyaroti/Grilled chicken/banana flavored ice cream/singam Thai beer."}
{"text":"This place is located in the back of the a shopping center. There is parking in the lot in front. Came in on a weekday afternoon. It wasn't crowded and we were greeted upon entering. We were sat soon after. They allowed us to pick our seats. The waitress was nice and attentive. The prices were good and reasonable for lunch. The food was okay. This is where they lost stars from me. It was presentable but it came out within 3 minutes of ordering it. The broccoli was ice cold like the took it from the freezer and forgot to warm it up. The rice was super sticky and the one good item I had was the sesame chicken. The waitress forgot to bring the appetizer even after the food arrived and when reminded she looked back at her written list to confirm. It's a nice quick place to go to with mediocre food. Some people had great experiences so maybe it varies by the day or by the wait staff that help you. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"This review is not for the quality of the food but for the staff and how cheap these people are.Never have I seen a restaurant where the waiter decides the amount of the tip. We were 3 adults and 2 kids (4 yrs and second one is 14 months) who dined in there. These guys added the tip amount to  our bill saying since there are 5 people, they get to decide the tip amount. To add to that, we ordered a side of roti only and the the guy charged us $4 for just that. I would rather pay a poor person than pay these guys any more money than they deserve.
Never going here again"}
{"text":"Tried this place while in town doing some Christmas shopping. Fantastic. Every part of the meal was great, the staff was friendly and awesome. Calamari was perfectly cooked, and the curry was top notch."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I've only eaten inside once for dinner with a party of 5 and the service was great. I tend to get take out from here since its convenient. The food is always ready when I get there. I always get the Pho because I'm obsessed. They have other good dishes too."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews and I was thrilled with the quality and taste of this food. I had the tofu and veggies with brown sauce. Very tasty. My husband had mango chicken and it was too sweet for me personally, but it was well-prepared. The service was good and reasonably quick. The restaurant was a great choice for lunch. We were in and out in about 45 minutes.

Very healthy and good."}
{"text":"I've never tried the Malaysian cuisine at this South Charlotte eatery and take-out, but their Chinese is consistently excellent. The General Tso's, Beef with Broccoli and Lo Mein dishes are all wonderful, and their pick-up service is speedy and convenient. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but for a Saturday night take-out meal for the family, it fits the bill."}
{"text":"Malaya Kitchen has been on my list to try for quite a while. It's tucked away in the corner of a fairly busy shipping center in the area, near some bigger names like Qdoba and Chilies. The decor reflects the menu; contemporary, but inspired by a deep Asian heritage.

The business is family-owned, which gives it an honest and inviting atmosphere. The wait staff is tremendously nice and helpful.

The dishes came out prepared very carefully, right down to the elegant floral garnishes. If you like Asian fusion, their food is incredible. We had the sesame chicken and tofu; both tasted very fresh.

Overall, can't recommend it enough. It's a quick and easy dinner that left me satisfied."}
{"text":"We ordered three different entrees, all of which were amazingly delicious! Everything is reasonably priced. Portions are good. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Their lunch menu is a better deal. 

Avoid the thai tea unless you like the packaged instant stuff. 

Location makes parking somewhat difficult but I would definitely come back. They close at 11pm. 

No changing station in their restrooms."}
{"text":"Location: In the arboretum by Le Peep breakfast restaurant

Ambiance: low-lit, few seating, seating wraps around like an L. Some by the entrance and then some that are perpendicular that goes pretty deep into the restaurant

Food: 4/5, pretty decent presentation and large portions. Flavors are pretty rich

Service: Very courteous staff

Food turnaround speed: Average

Price: Fair

**If you want Thai, Chinese or Singaporean dishes, they've got you covered. Better than the typical Chinese takeout, it has a pretty cool ambiance. Above average food but not earth shattering."}
{"text":"Just to get it out of the way, I don't have any experience with Malay cuisine. I do like Asian cuisine in general, and spicy food as well. The wife doesn't like spicy food as much as myself, but isn't afraid of it anymore.

The wife and I started with Roti Canai. The tortilla-like bread was fresh and warm. The menus says crispy, but I didn't get that. It was more like a tortilla fresh from the griddle to me. Good, but unremarkable. The curry sauce was delicious. I'd gladly eat a bowl of it as a soup, in fact, I did just that once we were out of pancake to spoon it onto. I'd definitely get it again, though I'd ask for it to be spicy.

I got the Pad Himmgpan with chicken for dinner. A nice mix of meat and veggies. It's not a wet dish, so all the flavor is on the food, not leaving much for your rice. The flavor was great, the menu said it was spicy, but the spice was moderate at best, the only bit of heat coming from the jalapeno slices cooked in to the veggie mix and the non-edible red peppers. Normally I'd ask for it hotter if I went back, but the flavor of this dish was so good I'd be afraid of any additional heat coming from the addition of something that would throw that flavor off. The chicken in my dish was exceptional. I'm pretty harsh on chicken in Asian cooking, as it often comes off rubbery and tasteless. This chicken was tender and flavorful. I liked this dish enough that I will have a hard time not getting it when I go back.

My wife got the Curry Laksa, an enormous bowl of noodles and veggies in the curry sauce our app was in, though it seemed less spicy. She enjoyed it, though the sauce was probably too thin to carry much flavor to the noodles. If she got it again, she might skip the noodles entirely.

The service was fast and friendly and the food was good. I definitely want to drag my wife back and try it again."}
{"text":"Very, very good.  I always go for lunch.  The specials are good, prices are really good.

I have never had a bad dish here.  The Taiwanese beef soup lunch special is so big I cannot finish it.  Singapore noodles are amazing.  Everything is always fresh and cooked perfectly.

Friendly staff, very attentive.  Good iced tea.  Don't hesitate to give this place a try."}
{"text":"The Service:
Friendly and prompt. Awesome job.

The Setting:
Looks like a fast food place with a bar and Asian-ish touch. It has TV and clean restrooms.

The Food we ate:
-Love how the salad was crispy fresh...but the salad dressing ruined it...ick.
-The calamari looked different (like puffballs), but they actually tasted better than I expected. The sauce that came with it complemented it.
-The summer roll and its sauce was ok...not that good, but not that bad either.
-My teriyaki chicken was a bit a bit dry with very little sauce on it. If they added a bit more sauce, it would've been perfect. It still tastes good though. The veggies that came with it was perfect.
-My hubby's basil beef tasted like a regular stir fry. And let's just say we shared my teriyaki chicken instead."}
{"text":"It's fine, but nothing special, the food is meh. The Drinks were served in can form to avoid refills."}
{"text":"They charge for drink refills so drink slowly.  I got the beef curry and it was nice and flavorful.  They seem to specialize in curry all the other dishes we got were not that great.  I will not be back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"The Mee Goreng and the Pad Thai were good enough to justify a return visit, but the Mango Scallop dish was disappointing due to over cooked, chewy, previously frozen scallops. When we asked the waiter if the scallops were fresh or frozen, he seemed to not know. I will return, but I'll avoid the seafood."}
{"text":"I've only been once and my husband and I opted for take-out. We both were pleased with our dishes although the \"medium\" spiced dish my husband hD was a bit more \"hot.\" Still, he enjoyed it. I had a vegetarian dish with chickpeas & cucumbers and it was very good. Healthy portions for both. The restaurant is very small but was very busy when we went. Friendly staff. Will go again."}
{"text":"Roti Canai is awesome. I pair it with the chicken satay and the Tom Yum soup. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this after being told by locals it's the best. The service was excellent, very attentive and nice people. Food was just ok. Maybe because there are so many different styles of cuisine offered, it's hard to perfect them all? Not sure, but it missed the mark for us."}
{"text":"One other review said best general tso's chicken...I can't disagree more. It was sticky sweet - zero spice. I was hoping to find a good Asian restaurant near home, still looking."}
{"text":"So good! Everything was so fresh! Often the problem I have with eating out is the veg. If it's overcooked or the flavorless I'm sad. I had the chili chicken.  it's spicy! And I love spicy food. I'm usually disappointed in the heat but this was perfect! And like good asian chili spice the flavor keeps building with each bite. I don't think I've ever had green beans as the main vegetable but I'm definitely going to be rethinking that! It was so good. My hubs had the teriyaki chicken and he only reason I'm knocking this to 4 instead of 5 was his chicken breast was a little bit dry. He ate most of his vegetables and had to share a mushroom with me it was popping with tenderness and flavor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure if this is actually a sister 'rant to Cuisine Malaya in 'liz but the flavors and execution are different enough to make me wonder. If I'd have taken a breath between all the curry slurping and pepper scarfing, I might have thought to ask.

Guess what I found in my bowl of curry noodles? Daun salam. A bay leaf relative - but more anisey, bitier, different. An awesome, strange nuance I always stick in my curry laksa but not to be found at our only other Malaysian joint. Made my little day, seeing that leaf, all scenting my curry with odd, tasty flava.

Roti was good, if standard. Hainanese rice on the burner here, but veggies beware - chicken stock abounds. 

Service was comfy and attendant. If I lived closer, I'd be here regularly, but even leaves of Salam won't get my belly to agree to a 30 minute drive when the craving for curry hits...alas."}
{"text":"Malaya Kitchen is incredible. I'm so glad that I found this delicious little gem. I am simply addicted to the Curry Laksa. I've come in enough that they know me...and what my order is. They are friendly, and everything that I have tried has been phenomanal."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Definitely try out the curry dish! The service here is fantastic. We do takeout from this restaurant usually ordering the curry laksa. The food is always ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. The roti canai is to die for."}
{"text":"The Curry Laska lived up to the hype. I also have to say that their pot sticker sauce was the best I ever had. All and all this was great place to simply try something different. I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an Asian fusion restaurant then it's a must to go to Malaya Kitchen! Our experience has always been great. It was packed and busy on Valentine's Day but it was understandable .. They had a big family in the corner. Overall , the food there is amazing! My boyfriend got sesame chicken with brown rice and I always get the Vietnamese beef noodle soup(pho Thai). We usually get calamari but my boyfriend had enough of it because we got it so much. If you never been here well you HAVE to come. It is a must"}
{"text":"Disappointing Malaysian food. 

The roti canai lacked in flavor. The curry laksa was bland to say the least. Even the nasi goreng couldn't save the day. What with all that ketchup (?) it was doused in!

I so wanted to like this place, being a big fan of Malaysian cuisine. I will probably give it another shot because lots of other things on the menu looked promising and the family running it though understaffed did their best to accommodate all our requests. Hopefully, they have some hidden gems in that extensive menu and I will find them soon."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  Never a wait.  Good size portions.  Excellent vegan and vegetarian options.  These guys really know how to cook tofu.  This is one of the best Asian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I tried a few dishes here and have not been impressed. The tofu is spongy, but the sauces and veggies are above average. They do have a few options, but they all seemed to have a similar problem - poorly cooked tofu. The tempura batter also contains animal products, but did look good. Overall, there are much better options if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"Great family operated place. The food in general was good, ordered the shrimp broccoli dish, it was perfectly flavored and seasoned. Also ordered summer rolls as appetizers, weren't that tasty though. For dessert I had the fried ice cream, gotta admit that thing was just fabulous, perfectly fried and sweet dough, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am Thai and found the cuisine in this restaurant very similar to dishes served in Southern Thailand. My family and I have eaten here many times and it is becoming our new favorite for Asian restaurant. We found most of the dishes that we ordered to be delicious, unique, and made with fresh ingredients. We did find 2-3 dishes that we ordered not to our liking but that might just be because of our personal preferences. The price here seem higher than other casual Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  Finally found a properly made General Tso's chicken.  I don't normally care for ginger dressing but I thought theirs was much better than I've had in the past or I'm just developing a taste for it.

I also tried the basil chicken.  Oh, this was so good.  They also have brown rice which is harder to find in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I ended up in this part of town, but I let my Yelp app randomize for me. I said one $ and sort by highest rating. After excluding a fast food place, Malaya was the top. Now, I know NOTHING about Malaysian food. In fact, I'm not even sure I know where Malaysia is on our big planet. But after eating this meal, I need to find out more.

I stuck to the specials menu and ordered the \"Malaya Roll\" which turned out to be ground chicken in a pastry roll that was fried to a crunchy goodness and served with a sweet chilli sauce. I ate all of it and then dipped the garnish cucumbers into the sauce too.

For my main, the Hong Kong Duck Soup caught my eye. When it arrived, it was a massive vat of dark colored broth with noodles, veggies and probably half of a duck sliced into bits. It took a little while until it cooled enough to eat but when it did, OMG yum. Deep flavor in the broth and the noodles were just perfect al dente and the bok choi was nice and tender. The duck. Oh, the duck. Tasty, meaty and all too many more adjectives that need to go here to describe a great meal. Check the picture I posted!

I opted to skip dessert, instead finishing the Chinese beer I had ordered.

Great service sitting at the bar. My only complaint is not their fault - my cell phone could barely get a 2G signal. :-("}

{"text":"To start get the potstickers pan fried. They have a great texture and delicious filling. So far, I've loved everything I've had. Curry noodle soup with veggies was tasty and had okra, yum! Taiwanese beef noodle soup is so flavorful and has the most tender beef in the land. Pho is a favorite, broth is fantastic, I also like this with veggies. I've had a few other items and you just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"How did I not come here b4??? A keeper for sure.

Tho the Hainanese rice seemed oily, it had a taste I could not pinpoint that tempted me to order more to go...garlic jasmine rice with a chewy texture, not dry. Mmmm. 

The Sarong Barong was served in a crispy taro bowl which our happy server snipped into bite sized pieces in front of us. Lots of different veges with shrimp and chicken cooked in a sweet, but not too sweet, soy sauce-wine base. Loved that it was not salty like most Asian restaurants. 

I couldn't pass up an even more tastier dish of Belacan (shrimp paste which is reminiscent of fish sauce). Served with okra and chicken for my dish but also available with green beans, beef, or shrimp. I'll definitely order this again. Now I must find a Belacan dish recipe . 

It's bn a while since receiving such doting service. From beginning to end, it reminded me of restaurants of days past. We were tended to meticulously from chopsticks to even being asked if we wanted our second bowl of white rice brought out to be added to the leftover take home. Most servers wouldn't bother. 

I hope to try other dishes here. I'm sure I'll be surprised again."}
