{"text":"We went to Fairview mall this Friday saw this new restaurant. Look very cool and fancy. We ordered ramen and salmon and tuna poke, food are very tasty but very salty... maybe next time I will ask him less source. Not sure if this possible for noodle though."}
{"text":"This is pretty good for food court ramen!   I ordered the spicy tantan ramen; the flavour was mediocre but it wasn't overly salted like traditional franchises. The noodles were my ideal consistency, a little bit more on the chewy side. My friend ordered the shio ramen which is most likely the best one as it packed a lot of flavour while being light. Definitely will come back to try different options."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on ramen but it was very tasty! The pork belly was a nice balance of fat and meat and the other toppings were fresh. Broth was tasty also! Nice to be able to get yummy ramen at the mall!"}
{"text":"I've been here 2-3 times now. Each time I tried different item - ramen, katsu, gyudon. The food is tasty and flavorful, I really enjoyed it. They also put some thought into the presentation, which is always a nice touch.  The price is higher than what I'd normally expect to pay at a food court. That being said, I probably would still go again whenever I'm at Fairview mall. After all, at least I know I'll enjoy the meal :)"}
{"text":"Ramen in a mall food court?! Yummmmm. No more tough decisions in the Fairview food court thinking about what to eat. This will be my go-to.  I tried the spicy miso tonkatsu ramen. The ramen is restaurant quality. You can taste the broth is rich with miso flavour. The noodles were a good texture, and the chashu had even layers of fat and meat.  Also tried the chashu baos which were simple in terms of ingredients and tasty for that reason.   I sampled a piece of their karage chicken, it was so good. Would have gotten that too but my stomach only has so much room!"}
{"text":"The food took way too long, the employees were taking their sweet time even though there were a bunch of people waiting. The food was okay though. Got the chashu don and the pork belly buns. Flavor was pretty good and they were pretty generous with the ingredients. They definitely need to improve on their time management though."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen for food court quality. The texture of the ramen reminded me of the ramen from the foodcourt in UNY or Jusco in HK. The karage was pretty good aswell again for food court quality. Not too oily and nicely flavoured. This new ramen option really spiced up this foodcourt and satisfied my cravings when I don't want to line up at the ramen joints on Yonge!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple months since I last visited Fairview mall. I was starving and looking to get something quick like poutine but noticed the new food options. The fake food display drew me in and I decided to get the chicken katsu don. I thought they were going to give me the last chicken katsu that is sitting under a heat lamp but they actually made a fresh one.   It looks like they are still new and have some kinks to work out. My order took almost 15mins to be completed. The workers seemed a little confused with their roles. The girl who took my order ended up preparing orders even though there were 3 other people doing it and there were customers just awkwardly waiting in line to place their order lol  Presentation wise, the bowl is very colourful. I wish the chicken katsu was placed into the bowl more nicely, but oh well. The bowl tasted even better than it looks. The chicken is hot and juicy and there is a nice balance in flavour. Typically I tend to eat more rice than I do meat, but this time I find myself doing the opposite.   Overall, food is pretty good and prices are reasonable. I'm not sure if the long wait and lack of organization is a regular occurrence or if it's because it's near the end of the day and the workers were already stating to clean up. I'll be giving this place a couple more tries regardless!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much my go to place for Japanese 'mall' food. So with that in mind..... The pork belly bao is ok. Sometimes the pork is more meat than a balance of meat and fat that makes it so good. But overall not bad and reasonably priced.   The Karaage chicken is blah. The coating is thin, the chicken bland. The pork tonkatsu fares better.  The shining light here is the ramen. The shoyu soup base is light and flavourful, not overly salty. The noodles are firm with a nice bite to them. Over all a surprisingly good 'mall' ramen."}
{"text":"While doing some errands in Fairview mall I started to get hungry and for convenience sake decided to head to the food court to get a bite to eat.  I came across this new place and decided after looking it up on Yelp (and the good reviews), that I should try it!  For mall food court food, It's pretty decent!   I tried the beef gyundon rice bowl.  It was $11 i believe with taxes.  It's actually a pretty big portion - definitely fill you up.  Lots of beef, rice, bok choy and scallions.  Flavourful and nicely cooked fresh rice hit the spot when the afternoon munchies hit.  I don't think I'd necessarily come here for Japanese food if I wasn't in the mall, but the next time I head to the food court here, this will definitely be my stop."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good for a mall's food court. I choose the salmon rice bowl. For 11.50 I got three pieces of steamed salmon with rice, root veggies & salad. The salmon was cooked fresh right before our eyes. I couldn't even finish all of my food as we also got some potato croquettes. The potato croquettes were delicious too. The only thing is when they cook the protein fresh you have to wait a bit for your food. But I'd buy food from here again."}
{"text":"My new favourite at Fairview mall. I really dig the chicken karaage. Located at the food court corner at the lower level."}
