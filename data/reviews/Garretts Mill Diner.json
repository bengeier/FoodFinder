{"text":"The staff was excellent.  Food was great.  They went above and beyond.  We would recommend this place to everyone.  We've never experienced this much friendliness from a restaurant owner and staff.  He held the door open for us.  Went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Really good food at a reasonable price. I'm huge on breakfast food and they definitely do a great job of it here. I have not tried their  lunch yet but the specials sound really good. The pancakes are the best I've had around here.. Crispy edges but nice, fluffy and light middles. Also I have to say the breakfast sausage was really good and I'm a little picky about that. Very nice staff and owner! Service was fast and food was fresh. If you have not tried them out you should! I hope other yelpers come and support them so they stay around for a long time. This place is a keeper. Can't wait to come back and try more items!"}
{"text":"RATES 4 on taste.... great pancakes cooked well a nice little home cooked crunch onnthe outside.... 5 on the owner that's on the premises..... 2.5 on the particular waitress that we had maybe she's new or maybe her skills are poor (good help on hard to find, I own a business I know lol) I would've gave 3.5 because of the server but can't. At this time they are using homemade butter, whipped cream, & sausage gravy WHAT!!! YEAH! All very good.... I will go back... TOO ME TASTE IS IMPORTANT!  SERVICE secondary"}
{"text":"Excellent service and very delicious breakfast at a reasonable price. The seating area is limited for a large gathering,we had about 14 adults and 1 child but the owner / waiter was able to serve all of us quickly! Would say it was a very pleasant experience and I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place - I really do!  The food: excellent! The service: inconsistent!!  We keep going back again and again because the food really is delicious.  I keep thinking things are \"just a fluke\" with the service but it just keeps on happening.  There seems to be an overall disorganization of the whole system in general, from seating to ordering to delivery.  People that came in and were seated after us had their orders taken before ours.  Then, their food arrived WAY before ours (and we're talking several tables.)  In the meantime, \"certain\" tables were being offered scone samples to \"enjoy while they were waiting\" (as announced by the server). We were waiting...and waiting....and we were still never brought any scones to \"enjoy\"!   Also, there seems to be a lot of favoritism/cronyism with the owner and certain patrons - kind of a who-you-know type thing.  That can leave others feeling left out or \"less important\" - and in a small place like this it makes it very obvious.    To sum up, it shouldn't be that hard to keep things consistent - and either give the same treatment and service to everyone in the place or don't do it at all!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for bfast... Sausage Gravy, Real Deal Potatoes, Scones!!! This place is fresh and delicious- everyone was so friendly and service was super quick. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came up to visit my childhood home and found a great place that felt like I had never left!! Amazing staff and incredible food! Planning another trip back next month and my first stop will be here. Thanks for making our visit that much better."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for breakfast, the place is great and the food is amazing! They just reopened few weeks ago! I highly recommend trying this place out! Trust me, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I went just to meet someone and have coffee and felt like I was a guest with Brian, the owner who really (!) wanted me to enjoy my meal. He checked in with us and let us know that he could accommodate my special diet needs. It wasn't overbearing. The coffee was OK American standard. I like mine a lot stronger. This place deserves a try!"}
{"text":"Thank you Brian for providing a valuable, great breakfast, and a clean experience in the greater Stow area!  I was born and raised in CFO and had several choices in \"the old days,\" but recently upon periodic returns from Packerland and Chicago (still a Browns fan, btw)have not found a good breakfast anywhere around the entire Hudson-Akron Area. The service was on-point and Brian was a refreshing change to restaurant ownership.  Good luck with your business!  You have what you need to continue to make it happen.  I like your business plan and never stop listening to your Customers, which I am a solid one now.  Help Brian you both will benefit!"}
{"text":"Perfect little breakfast place. My fiancé Mike and I go here at least once a week. Best gluten free pancakes I've had. He also has gluten free toast available. Eggs are always cooked perfectly. Reasonably priced. The owner is awesome and always super welcoming. Staff is friendly as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff are always kind and helpful. Just don't be in a rush when you go, they are not always the fastest. But try the pancakes! They are the best around!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and very accommodating! Everything from the waffles to the eggs and bacon are amazing. My son has celiac and they were able to sub out regular pancakes with  gluten free pancakes no problem! The owner is extremely nice, attentive, and hard working. This is a great little family spot."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp search, decided to try. Sign says \"Best Pancakes\". I tried pecan waffles and eggs. Very delicious! Also serve locally brewed coffee, good flavor compared to standard coffee. Owner/chef and staff were very friendly. I'd definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Just had a great meal AE Garretts Mill Diner. The food quality was high and the service was fast and friendly. I recommend the sour dough toast with your breakfast choice. Fresh brewed coffee was also a hit."}
{"text":"Stellar service and good home cooking. My 2 egg western omelette with bacon substituted for the ham was fluffy, hot and satisfying. I splurged and ordered a croissant instead of toast. My home fries could've been more fried but tasted good and my husband's steak and eggs were perfection!"}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time. The food was excellent, the owner is very kind and accommodating, and the prices are right! A MUST-GO if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and was looking for a breakfast place. WOW did this place deliver and how.   Fresh biscuits, homemade gravy and friendly folks. This is my new favorite breakfast place when I'm in town. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was good. Coffee was good. Bacon was good. But that biscuits and gravy... was thoroughly meh. I share some of the blame for ordering biscuits and gravy north of the Mason Dixon Line. Serving biscuits and gravy as runny and dry (respectively) as that in the Deep South will get you shot."}
{"text":"Corn beef hash with eggs was some of the best I have ever had. Phenomenal tasting beef, eggs cooked to perfection. The toast is not just your ordinary toast either - from a bakery or something. Coffee was good too. 5 stars for that hash though, my lord that stuff was amazing!"}
{"text":"If you go on the weekend, prepare for a wait. Weekdays are quieter. The place is small and simply furnished, but service is good and the food is exceptional. Great value too. They really do have the best pancakes, waffles and biscuits and gravy in the Akron area. This is a locals' haunt and our absolute favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for breakfast with my fiancé and two kids. No wait, excellent friendly staff and good sized breakfast portions."}
{"text":"Brian, the new owner, clearly takes pride in a clean and organized restaurant. When you walk in, the place is bright, and one can smell the food coming off the griddle. The servers were very attentive to quickly take your drink orders and ensure they stayed full. Wife had the pancakes, I had the mushroom omelette. Pancakes are amazing. They have regular and sugar-free syrup for you. Omelette was on the small side, but came with home-fries and toast. All things, the breakfast was very good and made fresh, to order. They have lunch also, and post their specials on their Facebook page. I would definitely revisit!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, definitely the best pancake ever!  Not a place to go if you are in a hurry, but the food is worth waiting for.  The food is a bit pricey for breakfast, but it is good."}
{"text":"Cozy and cool. This little spot has the feel of a quaint small town diner that you could come to know the owners name and weekly specials, while at the same time embracing the culinary trends of the future. We arrived at 8:45 AM to be seated promptly, waited on attentively, and checked out speedily (with an iPad ). Even at that early on a Saturday morning the dining room was at three quarters capacity....I imagine it gets really busy after 10 .   The food embraces traditional breakfast fare with unique stylistic components that set it apart from other breakfast venues. 1. Steak burrito with has Browns far and above any Bob Evans dish (high five on the availability of pepper jack as a choice of cheeses ), hash browns sliced large like an au gratin type dish vs the standard shredded cut. 2. Huge waffles! ...3. Probably the best French toast I've ever had both in taste and visual presentation! Add this place to the secret awesome breakfast place list!"}
{"text":"Really the best breakfast experience that I've had in a long time.  We were in town for a gymnastics event and went in for breakfast on the first morning based on the Yelp reviews.  We were warmly welcomed as we arrived.  They guy cooking actually waved us in a few minutes early while we were waiting for them to open at 7am...  The place is small but very nice -- great look  and feel.    The food is outstanding.  The first time we went, yes we went both days while in town, I had the veggie omelet with sausage.  The veggies weren't boring veggies like green pepper, they were like caramelized onions...yum!  My daughter had the pancakes and eggs.  We both had the fruit cup.  My favorite thing there might be the fruit cup!  Like, real cut, good fruit cup, not the normal stuff you get at most places.  It had canteloupe, bananas, apples, grapes....yum.  On day 2, I added a short stack of pancakes to my meal since my daughter loved her pancakes the first time we went.  Whoa, the pancakes are seriously good.  They are very close to crepes but a little thicker.  I've had a lot of pancakes over the years and these were almost the best.  They have a syrup warmer so when they bring the syrup over, it's already warm.  A very nice touch.  I highly recommend this place.  Great look / feel.  Very friendly people.  Outstanding food."}
{"text":"This is a small diner with great food! My husband and I have been there twice. The first time they were busy and we had a slight wait but it was nice to have coffee and talk with my husband. The servers were friendly! The food was great, my husband and I got the same meals both time because they were so good. I had the western omelet and my husband had the biscuits and gravy with eggs on top. Both were delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Man I am just a big fan.  I have been several times and have not ever been disappointed.  I have not ordered the same thing twice, but I have always had a pancake on the side.  There are very few places that get my approval of pancakes.  Most places use a bisquick type mix.  This place is all homemade (or a really good imitation).  Their sign says best Pancakes and or Waffles and I will agree.    I mentioned I have not ordered the same thing twice.  On he back wall, they have a big menu and lots of specials that seem to change by the week.  This is where I usually order.  This will also contain your upgrade / upcharge list.  Some of it is a little odd (e.g. home fries for pancake .50), but nothing that would make you not make substitutes that you feel you need.   Next time I go in I am just going for Pancakes, eggs and bacon.  There is a special for that and it is on the $5.00 menu side."}
{"text":"Similar to a truck stop diner.  The atmosphere was not great. The food selection was ok--the typical-- omelets, pancakes, waffles. But, they did not have any fresh fruit on anything, not even as a option, so I wouldn't consider this for those eating healthy.  The service, however, was really good."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for breakfast with my family based on the Yelp Reviews. We would have never found this place without Yelp since it is off the beaten path from where we typically go.   We were not disappointed! very cute little spot, with super friendly service. We were seated right away and had our drinks served quickly.  Boys had the cinnamon french toast, I had an omelet and my husband had poached eggs and home fries.  All was tasty!! The service was friendly.  All in all, a good stop for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Really good coffee, and the steak and eggs was the best I've had since I can't remember when. The owner made sure my steak was done to perfection and the waitress never let my coffee cup get empty. The food was wonderful, the service was amazing, and the people were a joy to meet and chat with. I plan to be back soon and often."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast here for the first time with an out of town guest. Since we were just looking for a simple filling breakfast, this fit the bill. I will definitely come back. The pancakes were excellent. Very light and fluffy, not the normal heavy batter in most pancakes. My breakfast was simple, hot, cooked fresh and not full of grease. Service was friendly and attentive. If those are the things you're looking for, than you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here while Christmas shopping for lunch.   We all got something different. Someone got breakfast. She liked it. Eggs, hash browns, bacon. Someone got the special breakfast burrito. He liked it. He has a large appetite and he enjoyed and was full. Someone got the soup and grilled cheese. She liked that. I got a BLT with fries. I liked it.  This looks like a nice little family place that cares about its customers. Nothing fancy but a good meal at a reasonable cost. Totally family friendly and good food. I'll be back.... :)"}
{"text":"This seemingly obscure diner is tucked into a little strip mall in the Stow area. When you walk in, you can tell that this is a family run business that specializes in making sure they can handle the onslaught of hungry and hungover diners. Let me start my food review by stating the Corned Beef hash is absolutely amazing. The owner indicated that they source their corned beef from the same vendor that many of the noteworthy corned beef shops utilize in Cleveland. Absolutely delicious and a must if you are a corned beef lover. We also fined on the pancakes and they were hands down some of the best either of us had ever had. Blueberry and Banana pancakes like this earn the five star review alone. These folks work tirelessly to keep up and their food shows. If you get the chance, stop by and take my advice. You will surely be back, as will I."}
{"text":"It's all about service folks!  We were greeted at the door (nice, warm touch) then waited forever it seemed to get a seat.  Again, it took them forever to take our order and serve us.  All this time the had someone dedicated to walking around and resetting tables.  Not impressed with their service at all.  The food was ok; average at best."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place that is clean, comforting with goid service, and great food, you found it. Not fancy, that's what makes it comfort food. A definite must try!!!"}
{"text":"Great find! Very good food and good coffee it's the good regular coffee not that gross bold stuff. The pancakes are good and the eggs were perfect. The fried potatoes were like what my mom makes. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here just about every weekend since we discovered this place. Service is always nice and friendly, food is great, and it's nice not having to wait 30+ minutes like at other breakfast spots."}
{"text":"My grandmother and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast and we found this place. As we walked to the door, the owner came and opened it for us. Apparently they were closed that day. He could have said, I am so sorry but we are closed today-and we would have gone somewhere else. But, he still invited us in and served us whatever we wanted. He was over the top nice and kind to us and acted as if it was no trouble to make waffles, eggs, sausage, or coffee (even without anyone else there)! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Just the ownership alone was very refreshing and the food was also great! Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great breakfast, and my wheat free- vegan options were catered to!  The BBOP's had a great local breakfast with amazing service and great coffee too.  Thanks Brian & David!"}
{"text":"Great food for breakfast or lunch! Friendly and on point service! Have anything you want your way..."}
{"text":"Great little diner, they do an excellent job and the food is reasonable and well done.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like home. The owner, Brian, is pleasant and friendly. Not just to customers, but his hard-working staff. They act as a team, bringing even more of a family feel to the experience. I like that they offer options for food allergies (ie gluten-free) but Brian also took the time to ask more questions to ensure the meal is prepped perfectly for your needs. This means a lot, and I've never experienced any other restaurant with that level of care. Even 5 star steakhouses. I would most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great little local diner. The staff is extremely nice and friendly, even to a stranger like myself. The place is clean but a little bare but that's not a negative. Good pancakes, sausage and coffee."}
{"text":"Love the little diner ambiance... Super nice people. We enjoyed our food and the portions are HUGE! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm afraid to write a good review because I don't want this place to become too popular. The staff rocks! I love a small breakfast place where you can banter with the staff. I feel like Norm when I go here (Cheers anyone?) the food is right on par with a good diner, they even have delicious gluten-free pancakes and bread. It's straightforward diner classics with a staff that takes it up a notch."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Very good food. Excellent coffee! I had the eggs, sausage links and home fries. All very well cooked and tasty. The home fries were fresh sliced potatoes and yummy. The pancake was also very good.   The owner gave us a complimentary home baked cookie as a bonus. I'd come back when in the area again for business!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy around  Excellent homemade food at an excellent price! Fast, friendly in a quaint atmosphere. Only complaint would be the coffee. Could be a tad more bold."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Garrett's Mill for breakfast this morning. It is definitely a case of everything was good, but nothing was great or special. Everything tasted good and was cooked well,  but I think it was a scoach overpriced for the portions. There was just nothing that would make me want to race back there. Everyone was nice, but it did take a while to get our food. I wasn't a negative experience, just average. The atmosphere was kind if like a city diner in a strip mall in Stow. That isn't a bad thing. We frequent the Stow Cafe for breakfast where we get much more for our money, but this place has a lot less of a nursing home vibe and the food is fresh off the grill even if it does take a little while. I would say check it out if you want and it will be good, but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Service was nice and friendly, but that's about it. The coffee was meh, the toast was okay, bacon was nothing special, eggs were okay, hash browns were very thin and not much of them. Also, although the service was friendly it was very slow, there were tables that were sat after us that got their food before us, which is always annoying. Overall, nothing great, but seemed to be run by nice people."}
{"text":"I love independently owned restaurants that are run by an owner who is passionate about their customers and food. Garretts Mill Diner is such a place.   Yesterday, I was looking for a breakfast spot near my hotel that a dear friend and I could meet up at to catch up and grab some vittles. I knew there was a Bob Evans nearby but that didn't excite me. Thanks to Yelp, I found Garrett Mills Diner. Certainly without Yelp, I wouldn't have ended up there.  It's a small spot in a strip mall off Steel Mill/Garrett occupied primarily by a bar.  Inside,we found about 15 tables, an open kitchen, the owner/chef and a great waiter.   The family vibe was genuine. We engaged in great conversation about his story, his vision for the restaurant and prepared ourselves for some excellent food.  The coffee, from a local roaster, was delicious. It blew away the Dunkin Donuts carry out I walked in with.  They boast of their pancakes and for good reason - the sample I tried was OH MY GOODNESS incredible. Light, tasty and delicious!  My friend had the French toast and loved it.   I had the huge, three egg western omelette with cheddar/ham/onions and peppers. It was excellent.  Service was superb. I drink plenty of coffee and our server was constantly refilling our large coffee mugs (what is it with places that give you a tiny coffee mug anyway?)  The owner Brian was the best. Friendly and engaging, one could tell he took great pride in what he was doing. And rightfully so as this place ROCKED!"}
{"text":"11 bucks for the tiniest plate of sausage and gravy and two eggs and some Home fries... tasted bland at best"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here today. I eat ketogenic (low carb high fat) and they were more than accommodating and made me a great low carb breakfast. Great food, service, price. Highly recommend, especially if you eat low carb."}
{"text":"An awesome local establishment with yummy food, a kind staff and good prices. The waffles, pancakes and cinnamon toast are terrific, as are the omelettes and shakes. Check this place out if you're looking for a great breakfast diner to become a regular at, or you just need some good food to make your mornings better."}
{"text":"Great food , place, and people! Went for breakfast and everybody loved everything. The biscuits and gravy is highly recommended, they were awesome .  I can say the same for the pancakes, waffles , and sandwiches and burritos .   They have all the basics and plenty of specials and originals. The portions were excellent and they have plenty of options depending how hungry you are. Also check out the fresh fruit and smoothies!   We were very well taken care of by everyone and Brian, the owner was a wonderful host and we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cute little diner! Their pancakes are really good and fluffy, with just the right amount of crisp on the outside. Everything is cooked to order, so if you go at a busy hour it might take a bit, but everyone there is very nice and the coffee refills keep coming! Homefries could have used a bit more seasoning, but they were still great! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic breakfast. Worth the wait! Mom and Dad had steak and eggs and I had the Harrison (one egg and hashbrowns). The staff and owner were so sweet! You have to try their pancakes, uniquely shaped and delicious!"}
{"text":"I regret having to say, my family and I will no longer be eating at Garrett's Mill Diner. The staff and owner are very friendly and the food is good even though I find  the food pricey ( 3.35 for one very thin crepe-like pancake for an example) for a small diner I accepted the cost because we like dining there.  What I can't  accept is the obvious padding of the bill. First time this happened my friend, who was with me said just let it go. The second I ordered one of their $5 specials on the board yet when the bill came everything had been charged separately costing me almost double so asked the waitress and she said I didn't order the special even though I ordered the exact same foods in the special.  Ok just a few days ago  my husband wanted to go to Garretts for pancakes and he got 2 thin pancake for 4.75 a side of sausage for 2.95 and I got one thin pancake for 3.35 and also a side of sausage for 2.95 and to 2 coffees which adds up to 18.50 without taxes, yet I was handed a bill for almost 26.00???   I examined my bill to fine that they had charged me for 3 extra I items I hadn't order nor consumed. I have had it!  It seems to be the owner's aim to make a little extra money off of unsuspecting patrons."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! Definitely the best place to eat breakfast in Cuyahoga Falls! The food is amazing and I personally love the chili! The people are great and service exceptional! If you haven't taken the time definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Seriously, always a happy group working here, especially the guy cooking. It's a tiny diner, but we never really waited longer then 10-15 to sit.   We love coming here for b-fast at least once a week. The bacon is the best you'll find at any diner. Perfectamundo! The eggs always perfect.   My 17 year old son really liked the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  I've also had the turkey club and it was good. So I usually get eggs/toast bacon, even tho they wear shirts saying 'best pancakes...'. So today I tried the pancakes thinking, a pancake is a pancake, right!? WRONG!!!!! So very very very wrong! Me and the 2 other people I was with today could not believe how airy-light/yet slight crisp on edges and perfect taste.  I mean. What just happened here!? The bar on pancakes has just been raised like to the sky!  I am not exaggerating.  We were all impressed.  Their coffee is not my favorite, but I like the oj.   Oh, and I almost forgot.  While you are waiting for your meal, the server will bring a free little mini scone, one for each at table.  These little bites are freakin amazing! You'll feel like Oliver from Oliver Twist, \"please can I have some more!\" Lol.  No I never really ask for more, it's their thing to give one little taste to each guest, but damn you'll be thinking it guaranteed!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I placed a pick up order and as soon as i walked in they greeted me by name and were very pleasant and welcoming!  Will definitely be returning to dine in!"}
{"text":"Tried this place randomly the other day. I opened the door and was greeted with a welcoming hello from everyone working! I loved that! Was quickly seated and gave my drink order. Drinks came fast and then the man took my food order. I ordered the crepes with Nutella. It was pretty good. To sugary for me but I'm not a big sugar loving person anyway. They were very tasty though! I plan to come back. You can't beat a friendly family type place. I love how they treated you like family when you got there."}
{"text":"Small family owned, this breakfast spot has the best homemade pancakes & waffles you'll ever taste."}
{"text":"I wish it was better than it was.  My wife and I went in for Sunday breakfast/brunch.  Even by breakfast standards they have a pretty limited menu (I think there were 3 omelets on the menu).  My wife had eggs with the usual (potatoes, bacon, toast), I had a waffle and a side of sausages.  None of it was bad, but none of it was great.  The waffle was pretty nicely done, properly cooked and a little crisp on the outside, but tasted just OK.  It would have helped if it arrived hotter and if they had something better than the cheapest pancake syrup.  Like I said, it was OK, but it wasn't anything special.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First visit, and we really liked it! It was about 11:30 on a Sunday morning/afternoon and we only had to wait about 5 minutes to get a seat. Everyone was really friendly. It was busy so getting refills was a little slow but not a huge deal. They gave us complimentary small scones which was also a nice touch.   The loaded breakfast burrito was a hit. I don't like eggs and tried a little and even I enjoyed it. The chorizo on it was really tasty. A little on the greasy side but still awesome.   The sausage gravy was very very tasty, but the biscuits were a little dense, instead of on the fluffy side. Personal preference I guess, no biggie. I still really enjoyed them. The meal is $10-11 but you can order just the sausage gravy and biscuits for $5.99.   I also ordered one pancake it was really good.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously. This place is delicious. We try to make it there for weekend breakfast as often as we can but ALWAYS go for Mothers Day. Their pancakes are phenomenal along with their cooked to order eggs. Their biscuits and gravy is out of this world. And the service is always great.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and exceptional service!  I'm new to the area and wanted a local place for breakfast - Garretts Mill Diner did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"A nice little place to get your basic breakfasts.  Definitely worth the great price, for what you get.    The atmosphere is very friendly.  The service and wait times were good, although the service also seemed disorganized.  For example, we were asked the same thing by different waitresses several times.  It seemed like they did not have assigned tables or something.  Paying up front, in the same little space people were waiting to be seated, was also a little awkward.  I signed on a portable tablet, ended up wondering why it wasn't just done at the table.  The menu had all your basics covered, but was pretty small.  Don't expect to be overwhelmed with new choices.    The food was good but varied.  My son had wonderful French toast!  My bacon and egg sandwich and my wife's omelette were average.  The toast and homefries were disappointing, especially the \"toast\" which couldn't have been in the toaster more than a few seconds."}
{"text":"I came in here while on business and needing a quick simple lunch.  It wasn't too busy on a Monday afternoon, and I was able to get served quickly.  I ordered the soup and grilled cheese special, can't beat the price!   The soup was a tomato basil bisque I believe and was really food.   I did the grilled cheese with cheddar and it hit the spot.  Menu is limited for lunch, bigger for breakfast.  I would def go back.  My only reason for not giving a perfect score is lack of options for those of us who don't eat meat or restrict from certain meats like pork/beef."}
{"text":"The food was good, however it took quite a while to get to our table. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Has a great hometown atmosphere and excellent quality. Brian is extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and very friendly and attentive. The new owner seems very dedicated to running a quality establishment.  Home fries were very flavorful and perfectly cooked. My wife's omelet was delicious and the pancakes were worth the  trip.   Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast this morning and were pleasantly surprised when we're were able to sit down immediately. We ordered 2 pieces of French toast and the corned beef hash. We waited, and waited, and waited.. a family of 4 who sat after us got their food, ate it, and left before our food was even on the grill. We left hungry 30 minutes after we ordered and they still made us pay for our coffee. We were obviously very disappointed."}
{"text":"We both ordered the Biscuits and gravy meal with sides of bacon.  The gravy was very good but the biscuits really ruined it--very dense, dry and cold!  These biscuits have got to be home made because I can't imagine any retail biscuit being this bad.  Service was passable but not attentive--she came around once to see if our drinks needed refilling and then was MIA.  Took some waiting and flagging down to get our bill.  Worse still, the bill came out to just over $30 for the two of us--which for a simple breakfast is way over what it should be."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely horrible. All but ignored for most of the meal.   The biscuits and gravy were inedible and got a very substandard bacon and cheese omelette. All went untouched after one bite. I was comped for the meals, but we definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Sunday morning we were seated immediately and had the BEST pancakes (honestly the best I've ever had) and breakfast burrito (huge and delicious). We were given complimentary blueberry scones which were a nice surprise. The pancakes were perfectly crispy around the edges, was provided plenty of real maple syrup, and the breakfast burrito was large and flavorful! We had excellent service as well- our server seemed very proud of the small business he was working for/owned/managed, and the (I guess seasonal) hot apple cider was DELICIOUS! I would have never guessed hot apple cider could be so more pleasant than cold grocery bought apple cider! And to top it all if he even gave me a to-go cup of it! And then our bill was extremely reasonable. He's made a regular out of me; I suggest everyone to try this place, at LEAST twice!!  1/15/17: The tomato bisque is TO DIE for!!!   4/23/17: The fresh fruit crepes (w/ chocolate/Nutella drizzle and powdered sugar) are the BEST."}
{"text":"Well, Yelp told me this place was good and Stow is desperately in need of a good breakfast place as the Cafe just doesn't cut it. Good news, our meal was great! It wasn't the sort of meal that drives me to want to wax philosophical about the taste but everything was done incredibly well and tasted good. Bacon was crisp without asking, potatoes crispy on one side, waffle crisp on outside and soft flavorful inside. All good. Service was a bit slow as the restaurant was nearly full, but not too much longer than you would expect from, say, a Bob Evans at rush. Interior is very simple but clean, but that's not what this place is about, it's about good food and service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious waffles! Great prices, specials, and service."}
{"text":"I met my friend from NC at this restaurant, for breakfast. We chose it because it is very close to Route 8 and the turnpike entrance. The young man (I think his name is Brian) that worked the breakfast shift this past Wednesday is unbelievable. My friend and I both own businesses and neither of us have seen someone take ownership of a business and treat it as their own like this young man. Mr owner (I think his name is Ben), if you're reading this, you need to give that young man a HUGE RAISE. we watched this man cook, wait on tables, answer the phone and ring people out all at the same time, moving faster than seemed possible, all with a smile on his face!!!!! We were both amazed at his ability to handle a restaurant full of people (including a huge table of about 10 elderly people behind us), cook and do everything so cheerfully. We assumed he owned the place. My friend asked him how long he had owned the restaurant, and he told us he was not the owner, just an employee! I have never seen an employee take such ownership of a business and treat it as their own. This guy is a GEM. truly rare and I hope the owner realizes just how lucky he is to have such a man in his employment. Oh, this guy can cook, too. Our food was excellent. I really hope the owner reads this, because this kid deserves some recognition."}
{"text":"M. Small business setbacks. The pieces are there but the puzzle is not complete. It's difficult to run a breakfast business from a remote location. It's equally difficult to run it on a budget. I admire the attempt being made but a booming business may not sprout in this garden. The food was overcooked and poorly presented. The service was not inviting. The roll between the front and back of the house need to be reversed.  D. Brian the owner came to our table and talked to us.  That as nice.  He was very personable. The meal was ok.  I have to go back to my same old thing.  Bland home fries.  They were very crispy, a little hard to cut, and definitely lacked seasoning.  A little onion, salt, pepper, would make a world of difference.   I got a hint of baking powder taste in the pancake.  Brian makes a really good sausage gravy.  It's different than most. It doesn't have that heavy taste of floor, and has some kind of  key secret ingredient in it. The sausage patties had good flavor, but dry like it was left on the fire too long or a reheat.  Musica latina in the background was kind of festive."}
{"text":"This is a great local diner! We had amazing breakfast and they gave us free scones while waiting. Everything is fresh and made to order. Go check them out for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I used to come here before becoming a Yelper. It's been over a year and once again Brian delivered. Not only did he remember me and he came to the table to chat before going to the grill.  Crepes and pancakes were cooked perfectly along with my eggs with onions and cheese. The coffee is not French roast or the crazy strong S#%bucks, but is not watered down as mentioned in another review. They do a damn good job. Two forks way up for family style diner, Garretts Mill."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I haven't tried anything off of their lunch menu, but I'm a huge fan of their breakfasts! I highly recommend trying their homemade sausage gravy. Looking forward to coming back sometime for lunch."}
{"text":"Garrett's mill diner is by far the best breakfast place around! We have eaten here at least a dozen times and Everytime we've come the food is delicious and the service treats us like family!    The omelets are huge, biscuits & gravy mouth watering, but the Pancakes are the most delicious I've ever tasted!! If you're looking for a fantastic breakfast or lunch place, this is the place!!!"}
