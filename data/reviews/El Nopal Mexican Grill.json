{"text":"I wish I could put zero stars worst Mexican food and service. From sauces, baby portions for asada fries, the picture isn't what states on the menu. They microwave the to go container so I had holes at the bottom and warm sour cream and guacamole."}
{"text":"This location was very clean and the service was friendly! Most importantly the food was delicious! I had the menudo and a carne asada taco and they were both very good. We ordered the asada nachos for the table and my only complaint was not enough."}
{"text":"Clean clean clean. This place is really clean. All the staff was cleaning while we were there even though the place was already spotless. The food was pretty good too. Street tacos so good they reminded me of being in Austin, TX."}
{"text":"Food was cooked to order and fresh. The different salsas were all tasty. My girlfriend had the shrimp burrito and loved it. I had the taco combo. Good prices. 5 star for food, proces, and staff, just had to take a star away on overall, for one thing. Cleansiness. Floors and men's restroom could be cleaner. Plese mgmt, keep your place super clean, then you have yourself a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"These carnitas tacos are heavenly and I should not do such comparisons, but delicious and scrumptious does not do them justice. The place was packed for one reason ONLY, the food here is exceptional."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall restaurant is delicious, I ordered the combination plate with 3 carne asada tacos. The meat was tender and marinated perfectly. The staff was very nice and the restaurant was kept very clean. I will definitely come back for their bacon wrapped shrimp and Taco Tuesday!! Did someone say .99 cent tacos??"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, but I hoped the food would make up for it, the torta that I asked for tasted awful, so I told the lady and gave me an attitude. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very tasty, clean restaurant, it's like a fresher and better tasting Roberto's! I had carne asada fries - they were very good!! They also offer American style sandwiches that look pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good food good prices and good service clean place.
Muy buena comida buen precio y buen servicio y muy limpio el lugar"}
{"text":"The lengua was bomb great price too I love the hard tacos probably the best taco in town no joke."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend stopped this cute place today and honestly almost didn't try it. I wanted crunchy tacos but on their menu it only shows street style it wasn't till I asked that's when we decided to stay. I ordered the combo play with 3 tacos which came with rice, beans and my choice of tacos. I got ground beef, grilled chicken and carne Asada my boyfriend got the Cuban Torta served with French fries. 

Okay so the service was amazing and the place was clean and setup so cute with tables and each table had a flower set and there was outside seating! 

The food my tacos were really good and the beans and rice were amazing, my boyfriend enjoyed his Cuban torts but said it was a normal one for home but it did taste rather delicious to me! 

Overall the atmosphere was so good and the salad was also amazing really enjoyed everything definitely returning back"}
{"text":"2nd trip here.  This place is legit!!  Basics:  Friendly and clean (men's room was spotless--even right after the lunch rush). I've never been to Mexico but the Machaca Eggs scream Authentic.  It was served w/in 5 minutes piping hot.  Whenever I'm at North Las Vegas Airport at lunchtime, I'm coming here.  (Nice view of RWY 12R)."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef & chicken enchiladas. They had an odd taste! Nothing like I expected. The taste was quite bitter & sour & no it was not the sour creme. Also ordered caldo de Res which was delicious along with 2 tacos (carne asada, pastor). Not to mention, i ordered a cheese enchilada on the side of the caldo de res & that was forgotten... also- I ordered beans & rice which were also tasty.. but when I received the beans they were completely all spilt from the containers into the bag. So I hardly even had any. For the amount spent, I was not satisfied. Will not order from this place again.

Ordered on the 12th of January at 4:00 pm"}
{"text":"If I could I would give negative stars. Service is extremely slooooooow. The food is subpar. I ordered a club sandwich and since there was no description on the menu I asked If It was turkey and the lady told me yes, I also asked for no tomato. The sandwich  came after 15
minutes of waiting and had tomato. My husband sent it back because I was in the restroom at the time. 5 minutes later the sandwich  came and it was not turkey but ham. Ham and bacon on the same sandwich ? Really ?! NEVER AGAIN. I can't believe I wasted my lunch hour at this place !"}
{"text":"Very thankful to work in this shopping center just for the fact that El Nopal is right here. Great food, great pricing and great employees."}
{"text":"This is the worst little taco spot ever . There's only pictures without prices ducktaped to the wall as a menu , the workers got my order wrong 3 times an started cooking others food before they started on mine . Was trying for a quick bite turned out 40 minutes , all tables were dirty had to clean myself . An tacos less then mediocre. If u like real good authentic Mexican food don't go here worst place in Vegas -5 stars"}
{"text":"One cashier, one cook, on a Sunday at a busy Mexican food place is not a good mix. Our order took 45 minutes to get to us, there were only two orders before ours. Keep in mind this is a step above a Robertos, it is by no means a full fledge mexican restuarant; so the cook time  shouldn't be that long. My taco order ended up being wrong, instead of waiting an additional 20 minutes, I just ate it. As far as the food portion, I had the smallest burrito I have ever had in my life; no joke, so much for a California burrito. The meat was basic and the beans were bland. We won't be returning. If your time is valuable to you, then I suggest you don't either. 

The two star is for thier prices, salsa and cleanliness."}
{"text":"OMG! I've been here 4 times and every time I get something new and it's always delicious. Their salsas are absolutely incredible, hands down one of the best salsa bars in town. Great customer service 

Camarones a la diabla - 8/10 - sauce is amazing and extremely spicy, shrimp are small though

Chile relleno- 9/10- HUGE chile! 

Enchiladas red and green- 10/10- perfection, not over sauced 

Carnitas tostada- 10/10 huge and delicious 

carnitas tacos- 8/10 just simple tacos but with any of their sauces, they're off the charts"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great tacos, this is the place :-) Bomb tortillas, good customer service, nice plating, clean restaurant... This place is a gem, especially for people living on the west side. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Super clean and super friendly 
 The food was great. Nice \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere . They have menudo  and cocido everyday. They also have off the menu specials daily. Just call and ask what today's  are. They even gave us a sample of todays(puerco con salsa roja  con papAs, pork in red salsa with potatoes )....delicious! The prices are also amazing."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I'm normally not a fan of pork tacos but theirs are out of this world. Just got one of their wet burritos. Normally I eat half and have the other the next day. This was so good I finished it off right away. Their portions are always decent size and a great value. The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a taco salad on my lunch break. It started off fine but as I was eating it the meat and the shell were ice cold. The winner of the taco salad goes to ROBERTOS! I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I just ordered $52 worth of food through Postmates. Two menudos, 2 seafood tostadas, and an enchilada plate. 
Blows my ever-loving mind how or why these people would not pack spoons, forks, napkins, lemon, salt, hot sauce, oregano, onion, NOTHING. I can't even begin to express the ultimate frustration of having no utensils and even more so, having ZERO fixings for my menudo. If you understand the concept of menudo, you know it is not MENUDO without lemon, onion, oregano, and hot sauce or some form of chilè. Cevichè with no hot sauce or lemon and salt???? Then, I open my daughters enchilada plate and I must've counted a whole 7-8 grains of rice. To make matters worse, I called them immediately to complain. Low and behold, I get a machine that says they're unavailable. I figured maybe it was just this one call they missed but nope, I called them as many times as there were grains of rice for the enchilada, 7-8, and no one ever answered. How is a place of business \"open\" but takes no calls? Had they heard my complaint, they would've had the opportunity to rectify the situation (or at least I would've hoped) and they would've spared this negative review. The food was OK-tasting. Just make sure if you're ever ordering for delivery, that you call and remind them to include whatever fixings go with your dish and also remind them of the bare essentials because apparently these people think we live in the medieval times and eat with our hands, then wipe them on our clothes. 2 thumbs down, plus my two big toes down."}
{"text":"It is the best mexican food around. Great Service great price. Its always fresh. Never pre done. Its not fast food. Its resturant quality. Great flavor. And taco Tuesdays are the best deals. 99c cant beat it. But again you may have to wait cause they are fresh made to order. Go and try it."}
{"text":"great place friendly service looks extra clean open floolr kitchen food just ok nice outdoor seating to cold for this time a year
real plates they bring the food to your table...
the have beer to ....."}
{"text":"The food is really good, it's just not consistent. It depends on what cook is working on that particular day.

The beans are cold every single time, not sure what the problem is there but the rest of the food is a good temperature.

If they were consistent all the time and the beans were hot or at least warm, then it would have 5 stars for sure!"}
