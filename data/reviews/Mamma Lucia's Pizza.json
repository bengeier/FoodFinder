{"text":"I went in about 45 minutes before closing and was told they weren't making any more pizza. The guy was a total jerk about it too.  Their pizza isn't that great, so being denied service has pretty much means they're never getting my business again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza.  Thin crispy crust, with great tomato sauce, it  taste like home-made sauce and cheese on top with mushrooms.  They have good calzones, spaghetti, cheesecake, etc.  They also have these little knots made out of dough and garlic on them.  They give you pizza sauce to dip them in, delicious!!  Lots of tables, so your not wondering were you are going to sit, and very clean environment."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup here on a friday night. Called ahead and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes. No issues there. Girlfriend and I each ordered a calzone. Growing up Italian i'm pretty picky in regards to pizza calzones etc. I had an ok calzone here. It was the perfect amount of cheese but the main ingredients (sauce and sausage) were a bit off. Both were very tasteless heck I've had better sauce out of a jar. Girlfriends was not quite as good (buffalo chicken) the chicken seemed a bit off and the sauce was quite runny. Probably will try the pizza but is not somewhere I would recommend"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  Sorry to hear they'll be closing but hope they find a new location in the north hills."}
{"text":"Staff could be a little friendlier - but here quality of the pizza makes up for it. Easy to stop in for lunch and pick up a couple slices or take some friends and order a large."}
{"text":"Yeah, Northway Mall is at best a third tier mall.  But Mamma Lucia's is alive and well.  Oh baby, is this great pizza!  I had a craving for it at lunchtime today, so I headed over and got me a slice.  Mmmm, garlic, cheese, sausage, and fresh tomatoes!  The slices here are so generous, they feed two!  Shall I bring 1/2 of my slice at home to share with Rick?

Nah!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fine but the guy with the black hair who is always there, possibly a manager is rude, indifferent and bad for the business. 

It also seems like staff turns up the tv so loud to watch sports in the evening that they could care less about customers comfort and interests.

I don't think the owner or general manager is ever here

No bathroom for customers"}
{"text":"This place is very expensive and the pizza was not that great. People have claimed that its the best around but honestly I have had much better pizza at other places in Pittsburgh. I'm not going to say which ones because this is a review of this place but know that they exist. 

We ordered two large sicilian thin crust pizzas one cheese and one pepperoni, the first thing that I didn't like is that it wasn't a fresh pizza they took two pizzas that they had under lights and warmed them back up with the oven....Pure junk the pizza cheese had already been cooled once and didn't feel right to my mouth when they warmed it up. Anyone who has reheated pizza the next days knows what I am talking about.  

Secondly this place is expensive for a basic pizza place, our two pizzas and two pitchers of pop came to $49.10 that's a lot of money for pizza and pop. I could have gotten 4 large pizzas at papa johns (with up to 5 toppings) and a 24 can case of pepsi at Giant Eagle and still had some change left over. Its not like we got a toppings loaded pizza either one was plain and the other had only pepperoni.  

Thirdly this place does not accept LivingSocial, Groupon, or any other things of that nature so if you have one they will only be accepted at the wexford location.  

Fourth, we got two pitchers of pop to drink you would think you would get a refill right? Most places offer that on pitchers of pop...think again refills were $3.00 for each pitcher so to get them refilled it cost another $6.00 on top of $49.10 we had already spent. We got two pitchers cause half the family likes Diet and the other half likes regular.  

Fifth, The staff is not friendly and really don't say much they look like they hate their jobs.

Positives: They did provide parmesan shakers and pepper flakes on the tables which you will need because the pizza is bland and has no taste without those.  

Summary: The pizza and beverages are expensive and the pizza is average to poor I would go some place else. My family and I will never go here again"}
{"text":"For the money, this is a one of the best lunch deals in town. A slice of pizza will cost you $1.80. You can get a half hoagie for a few pennies over $5.00. One of the daily specials will fill you up for less than $5.00. I've done lunch here numerous times and I've never been disappointed with anything that I've ordered and I'd be willing to argue that the pizza sauce here can go toe to toe with any of the other higher priced pizza's in Pittsburgh (and yes, I've tried just about all of them). 

Today I got a Buffalo Chicken half-hoagie. It was done and in my hands within ten minutes and it was very tasty, The lettuce was crisp the tomato was fresh and the cheese was generous. 

Granted the service can be a little \"rough around the edges\" at times and the restaurant itself could use a little updating but keep a sense of humor about yourself and you'll be fine. If you're looking for a good slice of pizza, pasta or oven baked sandwich that won't put a dent in you wallet, you can do a lot worse than Mamma Lucia's."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. This pizza is the closest I've found to New York style pizza outside of NYC."}
