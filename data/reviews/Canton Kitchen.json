{"text":"The food is not bad but prices are slightly high for what you get. Its a bit more expensive after they reopened."}
{"text":"Great Canto food. Some tasty dishes that I haven't tried before too. Portions and large and price is decent. Service was wonderful. The chef came out to check if our food was seasoned well.  He seems to genuinely interested on pleasing the customers. Decor and atmosphere is refreshingly modern. Clean washrooms are also a bonus :)"}
{"text":"Pretty damn great Chinese food for a very low price. Large selection, quick friendly service, and looks nice and presentable"}
{"text":"My favourite place for a quick meal.  Lots to choose from,  and you can ask for no MSG and less salt/oil. Place is clean and staff is very friendly. Tried their signature fish sauce chicken and soy sauce chicken, both were tender and flavourful (and they come with extra sauce on the side). Last but not least, generous portion and great value!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant because of the reviews we saw. The restaurant is hidden but definitely a gem. The food was flavourful, service was good and the place was clean and tidy.  It's a small shop but considering it's a small Chinese fast food type of restaurant,  it was more above average than most.  We had the beef brisket noodle soup, fried lotus root and satay chicken chow mein and were not disappointed.  Portions were a good size with generous meat and veggies, not like some Chinese restaurants that give little meat but more noodles.... would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food is extremely clean and I don't think they put any MSG.... most Asian food I go to give large portions but it isn't as fresh but this place is really fresh and the interior of the restaurant is updated and really clean with a wide selection of menu and almost everything is under $10 so you can get something really fresh.... they only cook it for 5 minutes so you don't have to wait long and there soya milk is good.... I try something new from the menu every now and then"}
{"text":"Three words:  Sand Ginger Chicken.
That's all you need to know.  When a place lets you know they feel they have a special dish, you should almost always pay special attention - and this is a classic example of that.   I've had a few of their \"signature dishes\" now, but Sand Ginger Chicken in particular is reason enough to come here.  The texture of each bite is just as much of a foodie pleasure as the intensely delicious taste.  Stop reading and order!  Salty gingery tasty chicken goodness!"}
{"text":"Location is not bad. It is in an unexpected place but there aren't many Chinese restaurants within the area so its good.

Environment is clean and a typical lively Hong Kong style atmosphere. Gotta have your Chinese news channel blaring in the background.

Food is not bad. A bit greasy but its Chinese food. Wouldn't be the same if it wasn't greasy. Portion size was quite a bit and pricing is fair. They provide soup, soy milk or chrysanthemum team for each order. Soup was bland and I couldn't finish it.

They have lunch specials but promote it on a sign outside, not inside. So be sure to do your studying and let them know.

Overall the place is fair. Nothing special. I'd come back but only if there aren't other options or if I'm indecisive on where I want to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food, tastes great, portions are good, can't ask for more!  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow this place is now on my list! Amazing service, extremely clean and owners are so friendly! General tso chicken was delicious :D"}
{"text":"Great Cantonese styled Chinese food. It is a restaurant where you can stretch your dollar for some decent traditional Chinese food. Their signature chicken is tender and flavourful. Their vegetable and beef is tasty. I recommend coming here if you are looking for something other than egg rolls and Gen. Tao chicken! Friendly staff/owners are a plus!"}
{"text":"Super super super clean place with really nice, friendly owners.

I haven't eaten authentic Cantonese food before but this seemed legit and was definitely delicious.

We tried the salt and pepper chili prawns and sweet and sour chicken dishes - both super tasty and fresh! Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $18 after taxes!

I want to come back to try the house specialty, sand chicken (described to us as a crazy yum dish with tons of fresh ginger - YAY!)"}
{"text":"Went here on Sat lunch.  I love this place.  It's clean and the food is always good.  I have to say out of the 4 dishes that I ordered, I didn't like the sticky rice too much.  I found it too greasy & not a big fan of the preserved pork taste.  Other than that I loved everything."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, fast and decently priced and we ordered things that weren't on the menu that we wanted. What more can you ask for! So glad we don't have to go downtown to get certain dishes we crave for."}
{"text":"I love the selection of dishes! A real Cantonese resto in the area is long over due.

I've tried their tofu, eggplant lunch combo and I'm a fan. They don't skimp in flavour. Good value!"}
{"text":"One and only restaurant in this neighbourhood. Food are awesome, with the fair prices. Most of the Chinese restaurants' chicken can't match their style. Noodle soup is good for a meal if you go alone. I have finished that big bowl in 5 mins. Double thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First of all, the name has changed to New Canton Kitchen.  Secondly, I kicked myself that I didn't see the poster about the $3.99 tax inclusive (plus beverage) lunch menu.  If I had had, I would have ordered from it, and this would be a 4 or 5-star rating based on value.  Since my item costed $6.50 (still a fair price), it is now a 3.5 star rating.  The pickled pork belly on rice tasted quite good.  Many popular meat on rice and noodle choices on menu, though none unique.  Competent fast food booth for lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good. I've enjoyed  the following dishes :

Shanghai Noodle - twice 
Chicken with Tofu
Beef Brisket with noodle 

The restaurant is quite new and still finding its footing. Very tasty food but I have to return again to verify consistency.  Shanghai noodles was very good the first time both in taste and presentation bit the second time around was sub par.  

A meal will cost you $10 including tax and tip so you get great value for your $$$.  Quantities are quite large and the staff is very friendly.  The server asks for feedback from his customers and he genuinely cares about improving the quality. 

I highly recommend you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Looking for a decent meal with out breaking the bank?  Canton Kitchen is a place you should check out.

Pros:
Great value

Cons:
Specials are all in Chinese

Like I said earlier, Canton Kitchen is a great place to get a good meal for cheap.  You can get dinner for 4 here for about $25-$35 which is amazing.  There are also lunch specials here from $5.99 so if you're eating alone, that's no problem at all too.  Rice comes for free when you order 2 or more dishes which is also another plus!!

I came here on a Friday evening.  The place is a little small but can still fit about 10 tables inside.  This place mostly services take out though if you ask me.  If your a group that doesn't want to cook, this is a great option.  I ordered 3 dishes and they came out blistering fast.  I was in and out of there in 10 minutes.  Would of been even quicker if I had called ahead of time.     

Being very cheap, one would assume the quality of the food would be very bad to make up for it.  Not so here my friend.  While the dishes here won't be called spectacular anytime soon, it's more than good enough for the price you pay.  I've had food at places that charge much more and are not as good here.  

So again, my main gripe here is that the specials on the chalkboard are all in Chinese.  They do have an English menu but none of the specials are listed on it.  I have said it in the past about all Chinese menus here and I'll say it again.  It's not as bad here since they do actually have an English menu.  Only listing the specials in Chinese though, seems a little unfair to me.

All in all, I see myself coming here a lot on a weekday where I just don't feel like cooking but don't want to hurt my wallet too much.  I recommend this place to all but do come with someone who can read Chinese to really get the full benefit of this place."}
{"text":"My favorite take out place. This location is perfect for me since I work just around the area. Their food is always good and the price is very reasonable. I love their signature chicken. It's so tender and seasoned perfectly. It goes so well with rice and some veggies!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here for supper yesterday. Nice and simple restaurant. It was not busy at all but they just opened less than 2 weeks. 
We decided to have the diner for 2 combo D (pork belly and fish filet with veggies ). We did not have to wait too long for the food. It came with a generous portion of rice. The fish was good and the veggies were fresh. I was not sure if I would like the pork belly because of the fat, but it was so well prepared that I could hardly tell there was fat. I did order a pop with that because the tea was strong. 
Overall it was very good and at a good price for portion size. They do serve the rice on styrofoam bowls and give you plastic forks and spoons. Staff explained that they want the food court style like their other location (which is in a food court ). Staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Great taste with fair price, located at a food court, I had three dishes with rice only $25 after tax."}
{"text":"Production line of authentic, genuine, to-go, non-designer-ish Cantonese food.  BBQ available, different noodles (we tried the Canton Kitchen House noodles - very, very good), Malaysian rice, you name it.

They are BUSY.  Phone never stops ringing for take-out.  No rancid smell of oil and the kitchen is clean.  They use free-range chicken for several of their dishes, if not all - they also make the Hokkien-style steamed soya chicken.  OMG.  Prices - very reasonable.  Fast, brisk but friendly and polite service."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic mom/pop shop style Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and not sodium filled like most Chinese food. It's great that this area finally has a good Chinese restaurant. I recommend the soya sauce chicken, house special vermicelli, any of the pad sewn (fried noodle) with satay sauce. The staff is very friendly and very attentive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is head and shoulders above lin garden.  The place is clean as it is, and I see they have renovations planned next week. My Cantonese chow mein was great.  Generous chunks of white fish, chicken, etc.. 
I will be back before long!"}
{"text":"Forgive me for this review of Canton Kitchen. It is past due and i can only say what little I can remember. I came with family, about table of 8-10, so we got a lot of different dishes. Their trademark chicken, some greens, chive omelette, lotus cake. Most of which are just chinese staples at restaurants.

What I liked about canton kitchen is that it has a home cooked taste and feel to it. Really, it's as if I was a dinner guest at their home for dinner. Nothing overly elaborate and showy. Just simple easy to stuff your face with food."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite and came across this place. Chicken was super moist and full of flavour. One of the best Chinese chickens I had and had me addicted to hainese chicken afterwards. They serve generous portions of rice as a free side if you order more than two entrées I think. I'm hoping to gobback to try more of their items later!"}
{"text":"This is no gourmet but if you are value originated and looking for some Cantonese food that tastes like home? Canton Kitchen might fit the bill.

$6.99 for an entree dish and if you order 2, it will come with a huge bowl of rice. My father still believes that one has to eat rice to have the strength and energy. BTW, the $6.99 entrees does have a whole chalk board of selections but all written in Chinese.... They do have an English menu but a little different in a few items.

Tea infused Chicken and Soy Sauce and Braised Mushrooms with Tofu were both well prepared. 

I know I will be back again when I want some cheap Cantonese eat with good Wok Hei. They also have noodle/rice special the whole day.

There is table service if you want to eat in. The sit down area is more spacious and cleaner than typical food court.  

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Canton Kitchen is always the busiest at the food courts at Silver Star Blvd. 

Good prices with meals starting at $3.99 tax with a choice of drink/soup of the day/soy milk drink! No need to wait for lunch specials since it is all day long!

I cannot even buy food and cook at home at this price point?! Maybe that's why I eat out so much?

Vermicelli with Pork and Zucchini ($3.99) with milk tea was great for breakfast! So many veggies made me felt healthy. 

Take it easy with their Chili Oil though, it has peppercorn inside! A lot spicier than the usual ones, they have bottles on sale for $5!

You might have to wait a little for your order to be ready as there are so many phone in orders for pick up... but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, Hot and Fresh! The only lack of milk tea in their combo menu was disturbing. We ordered the pork chop rice and XO beef noodles. I had the Coke while my Girlfriend had the Soy Milk. 

They have a huge selection of choices for lunch but the prices were a bit steeper. There is a lot of seating and they do offer soup of the day. The soup alone is $1 on their menu which is quite incredible. A lot of places charge a lot more for soup."}
{"text":"Was decently surprised by this place - I always drive by thinking it was a fast food type of deal offering take out only. The interior is actually quite spacious with about 10 tables (even large round ones that can fit a party of 8) and everything looked pretty clean. 

Although a lot of people do come by for take out, it's still pretty busy but no wait necessary to be seated. A lot of your typical chinese dishes though they do specialize in chicken, and my parents love their various fish dishes as well. It's homestyle cooking which is always nice. Upon talking to the owner after finding out they ran out of fish, he apologized for not buying enough this morning - we later found he buys fresh fish every morning at the supermarket which is a very good sign of the quality of food served here.

The prices are quite average for any chinese establishment, but one might find it just very slightly pricier if you're thinking of this place as a take out place. We were also charged for rice which we thought was included in the set dinner menu. But soup did come included. Overall you can expect to spend roughly ~$15/person here.

Price, quality of food, service, and cleanliness, makes this place a sure 5/5. Bonus points for the owner servicing tables and making sure everyone had a decent experience, as well as whoever is the graphic designer for this place lol. Definitely an excellent place for a casual meal that's easy on the pockets and great for your belly."}
