{"text":"After being mesmerized watching a video featuring their pasta in a cheese wheel . . . Yes you read that right: PASTA.IN.A.CHEESE.WHEEL, we immediately made dinner resos (your only options are between 5:30-6:45pm or anytime after 7:45pm due to their 20 person capacity)  Once you find this hidden gem (tucked inside Una Takeaway), you are welcomed into a cute and cozy venue.  They started us off with some savoury popcorn and bread and omg, soooooo good! We took this as an indication of what was yet to come!  Cheese Moretum (salted cheese and braised artichoke) to share, we ordered the carbonara, oxtail rigatoni and braised lamb gnocchi to share. We devoured what seemed like two loaves of house baked bread with the cheese, which was really rich and creamy. I can't pick a favorite of the pasta dishes, each had their own uniqueness that made them shine. The roasted pine nuts on the rigatoni added great flavor to the the oxtail. And who knew you could eat celery leaves (they taste just like celery without the texture) Instead of individual gnocchi pillows, the lamb was placed on a gnocchi disk that looked like a waffle which had amazing texture and flavour.  The perfect ending was the chocolate gelato affogato, which was a production all on it's own. As the espresso was poured over the merguine and gelato, a bittersweet aroma arose in the haze and captivated us. This was a dessert for all our senses!   This is an ideal spot for an intimate dinner, whether it be a date or gathering for a small group of friends!"}
{"text":"Make sure you make reservations well in advance as they book up fast due to the small amount of tables in the restaurant. We started with the chicken liver & almond, this was super creamy and super flavourful with the pickled onions, egg on top to mix in along with the granola as great texture. The radicchio and endive salad was nice to share between the 3 of us. We decided to order 3 pastas so we can try a little bit of each. The favourite was the spaghetti alla borttaga but thought the pasta could have been cooked a little bit longer. We also we're excited to order the pasta where they mix in the giant wheel of cheese as seen on IG. It was nothing special. Just cheese, pepper and pasta. The bucatini alla matriciana with tomato sauce was tasty as well."}
{"text":"Really good food and wine. Take your guy or girl and treat him/her to a date night here. You'll enjoy it! A booking is recommended. Also in addition to the proper dinner that you'll order - get the popcorn as a side. It has real cheese on it. It's really good."}
{"text":"I'm torn between rating this place as a 3 and 4 star. My girlfriends and I were looking forward to the pasta and between the three of us, we shared 3 appetizers, 2 salads and 3 pasta dishes.  The appetizers were very well done - particularly the chicken liver and the tripe.  The salad was interesting - the beet salad were shaved strips as opposed to chunks... a different way to eat it I guess, but I prefer the chunks.  The pasta was where it fell apart for us.  I am all for house made pasta (in fact everything is made in house) but the texture was off.  Rigatoni was a touch too firm, spaghetti was very thin and ramen like and the linguine was similar - they did not have a smooth texture, which was a shame as the sauce was really good!   I'll leave it as a 4 star as service was really good and we enjoyed most of the food."}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun! Step inside this place and forget you are in Calgary. Decor is awesome. Food is delicious. Cocktails are deadly. Service is professional.  I tried four different pastas, chicken liver and almond, and cauliflower and cumin. Some of the dishes use unusual combination of ingredients but it works! The chicken liver and almond is  my husband's new favourite appetizer. The pastas are homemade and rich.   Just a heads up. If you usually dine at Rea's or Chianti's, you may not like this place. Portions are NOT huge because the dishes it's quality here, not quantity. If you have a healthy appetite like me, I'd share an appetizer, a salad and get your own pasta."}
{"text":"Calgary's food scene changes on a day to day basis and I love Big Taste YYC because it reminds me to check out what's new on the scene. Bread & Circus is a trattoria tucked away inside Una Pizza. Thanks goodness I actually read the instructions in my Open Table email confirmation because if I relied solely on the address I would have been wondering up and down 17 Ave for ages. You enter via Una Pizza Takeaway. I'm not quite sure how big a place it is, the tables that I saw were set quite close together but it looked like there was more at the back and a separate entrance. Interesting decor but it can get hard to hear your companions if neighbouring tables get too loud. The Big Taste offered selections from their regular menu and consisted of Kayle's Caesar Salad, Lasagna and Amaro Zabione. There are some things they have to work out. We were on a time constraint and the server said that the restaurant preferred that we either all did the Big Taste Menu or a la carte but not a combination and the Big Taste would probably be faster as they were fully prepped for that. They have an interesting take on Caesar Salad in that the lettuce is a big chunk of iceberg lettuce with dressing and heaps of cheese on top and mini cubes of bacon/ham? (not sure). I was a little taken aback as I'm used to the well mixed version but surprisingly it was a very good caesar. The dressing had all the right notes and even though the dressing was on top and you basically cut your lettuce into chunks it was really enjoyable. The interesting take was the addition of fresh dill which just added an extra lift to the salad. The lamb ragu for the lasagna was perfect and a really nice lasagna, not heavy and the lamb adding a subtle flavour. The dessert impressed the least. It was too boozy and runny and disappointing. Not sure if it was because they put too much liqueur in the bottom of the bowl and then served the zabaione on top but it had the consistency of soup. It was a long wait between the salad and lasagna (almost half an hour) so I think the kitchen needs work on how they get food out, the lasagna was not a thick chunky version that would have taken hours to bake and remember they told us that it would be faster than a la carte because they were prepped for that as it was the Big Taste offering. Parking could be an issue as the restaurant is right on 17th and between the mounds of snow and rush hour parking can be a challenge. It is a small menu which I like as it doesn't overwhelm you with choices. There are some really interesting appetizers and dishes that I will definitely go back to try. They'd get a 4 if they had gotten out the meal in a more timely fashion and if dessert was better so I'd say 3.5 out of 5. Our server was excellent and knew her menu and wine and even got one of the wines from Una as they didn't have the variety my friend wanted on the Bread & Circus list and gave her a tasting of both her choices to make sure she got the wine she preferred."}
{"text":"All I can say is great everything, the salads are outstanding, the pastas as outstanding, and the service also is outstanding. Try different dishes every time I go. But the Cacio e Pepe is a must to try, meaning cheese and pepper, it's tossed in a grana padano cheese wheel. Love it! And make sure to try the  funnel and orange salad."}
{"text":"Food , service , drinks , ambiance , ... Action !  We had a very pleasant dinner experience at B&C. The food was very tasty, and the portions were surprisingly big. The service was top shelf too ! The cocktails , starters , main and desert consistently good."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian eatery. Excellent service. Although it is a small menu it is big on taste. Fresh made pasta, amazing beef carpaccio and perfectly cooked steak. We will definitely be back to Bread and Circus."}
