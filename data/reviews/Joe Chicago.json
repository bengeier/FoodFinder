{"text":"Tried their burger, pizza and brisket. The food is below average and obviously overpriced given the quality.

Their pizza doesn't even come close to the actual good Chicago ones.

Their service was friendly and the seating area was good. Parking is at the back."}
{"text":"I have been in search of a restaurant where great food and service go hand in hand. Saturday night  my boyfriend and I had dinner at Joe Chicago and we found just that! We ordered the chicken wings appetizer, I had the ribs and my boyfriend had the brisket. The ribs were falling off the bone, the wings were to die for and the brisket was out of this world!! Joe the owner came out to greet us and made sure that we enjoyed our meal. We found what we were looking for incredible food and great service!!! 
Convenient parking and a real Chicago feel atmosphere,  definitely going to be regular's at  Joe Chicago!!!!!"}
{"text":"Passing through Marche Central with a couple of co-workers went to Joe Chicago's for our lunch break, I wasn't really in the mood for a burger until someone ordered this intriguing piece of meat in a bun. So i caved had a burger and a pulled pork poutine. I was very impressed both were delicious and worthy of 4 1/2 stars. Only beef i have took awhile for our order."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's close to my place and is a good change from all the stale shish taouk places. 

The Burger is awesome. So are the wings and everything is so fresh. Nothing frozen I like that."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I ate in montreal. All ingredients are fresh even fries are cut by the chef . Sauces are made by Chef. It's worth a try. Unfortunately the restaurant entry is not easy to find but it definitely worth the try. You will never regret it."}
{"text":"From presentation to taste, my Harry burger was fantastic. I'll be trying the pulled pork snadwich next and oignon rings (they look amazing on the pictures). And I want to try the ribs of course. They also have some pretty amazing german beer called Krombacher. Washes down the amazing food really well."}
{"text":"I love Joe Chicago! Good food and service. The chicago style pizza is a must try. There's only two places on the island that make that style of pizza. Be warned, the Big Joe Platter is not for light eaters. Most of their sandwiches are also very good, like the Big Al Roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"The wife and I visited Joe Chicago on a Saturday night and to be honest...we didn't know if it was due to Joe Chicago being a very new resto...or the night of our visit being during a snow storm raging on... but when we walked in... we were the only patrons there! 

Awkward... 

The staff were however quite happy to see us, we were promptly seated and given a few minutes to peruse their delicious looking menu. We went with their beer battered onion rings and a pair of double Harry's hamburgers. As a side I went with fries and the wife went with a poutine.

Let's break it down shall we?????

- The Beer Battered Onion Rings were absurdly good. Serving is generous and it truly hit the spot! Personally, I love onion rings and this ladies and gents... was the best I've had in awhile. LONG LIVE THE MASTER OF THE ONION RINGS!!!

- Double Harry Hamburgers looked and tasted very good. Sure the size of the burger tried to impress me and challenged me that I couldn't get it all in my mouth.... it failed in its challenge.... and it's delicious 'death by foodie' made me quite the happy man. The patties were well seasoned and all in all, a solid burger.

- I barely touched my fries but they were the kind you'd find in Baton Rouge resto... and they were even better! Sadly, I left over half of it there as I was filled to the rafters to this point. My wife however devoured her poutine... she considered it 5 stars! So take that for what it's worth!

- The soda refills are free. LONG LIVE JOE CHICAGO!!! 

The service was attentive and friendly, nothing but praises to be given here.

The bill was about average. It's certainly not the cheapest meal but it's basically on par of what you'd expect to pay for a gourmet burger joint.

All in all, I felt it was CRIMINAL, CRIMINALLLLLLLLL for a place as good as this be this empty.... but I'm sure word of mouth will quickly spread and hungry foodies of Montreal will make their way here and experience what Joe Chicago has to offer... and it's a lot!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I definitely recommend the sliders. (The brisket was crazy good)

Friendly service. Fast delivery. Try it! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Joe Chicago - a taste of Chicago in Montreal... While all of the food sampled and the  service were great, what I truly delighted in was the poutine. Even if you don't love poutine, you're in Montreal and it is practically illegal to find yourself in this fair city and not indulge in this decadence. I happen to love poutine, but this place has definitely ruined  it for me forever. The gravy was sublime (not sweet), the cheese curds fluffy and the portion ridiculous. It was by far the BEST  I've had. Sure it ain't in the most happening of spots, but it was oh so worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing! The spice sauce is phenomenal. Not too hot and not too sweet. The wings and onion rings are very different and the deep dish pizza was unlike anything I have ever experienced. Just perfect!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a nondescript corner of a strip mall is a door that leads to this incredible find of eats that play up to its Stateside touting. 

The place is spacious and clean, and service was phenomenal. From my server to the owner and head chef of the restaurant, they definitely profuse friendliness and warmth that of their Windy City brethren.  

The food came out hot and prepared just right. My burger was an incredible meal in itself; the patty cooked to pink perfection, and the smoked meat really offered a hearty sense to my palate. I also sampled the pulled pork and WOW. My server told me the owner smokes his meats on premises every morning, low and slow... just the way it should be. 

Everything on the menu looked incredible... I wish I had more time to explore more offerings!

If you are from the States and are in town visiting, and really have a hankering for traditional Americana flair, you won't be steered wrong at Joe Chicago.  This place has earned a spot on my \"Must-Visit-Again\" list when I'm back in Montreal.

Mahalo for reading, and happy eating!  :D"}
{"text":"After reading about Joe Chicago on MTLBLOG, my 'cue loving family had to check it out at the first opportunity.  This hidden gem is located off the beaten path in Ahuntsic, but well worth the trip from the Plateau if you're a hard-core carnivore.  

We started with the onion rings, which were in a beer batter, which gave them a tempura-like crispness.  This was followed by the Chicago-style pizza, which was good, although I never met a pizza I didn't like.  Since our family motto is \"go big, then go home\", this was followed by Double Harry burgers (half a pound of meat!  Bacon! Cheese!), a chicken Caesar and a Smoked Chicken Breast platter.  This was my choice, and will be my go-to on subsequent trips.  The fat had rendered out of the skin, leaving it with the crispness and taste of bacon!  Yes, chicken skin bacon.  You heard it here first. 

No room for dessert, but there was plenty of time to interact with Chef Joe and his family.  Their warm personalities were a treat in the cold Montreal January!"}
{"text":"Went with my wife yesterday...still full!  Awesome little place, portions big, food was excellent and fresh !! The owners Joe and Mary were extremely friendly....go support them and give them a shot! The address says L'acadie but front entrance is really on Sauve/Cote Vertu..."}
