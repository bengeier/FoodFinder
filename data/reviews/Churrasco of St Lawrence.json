{"text":"On a bright sunny spring day, there's no better given the outside picnic table seating.  Get there early though; before the lunch crowd has the line-up careening through the market.  Their speciality --- chicken.  Sandwiches are fresh and tender and they don't skimp.  Get a side of crispy fries and pop and you're looking at 10 bucks out the door.  The place is absolutely no frills but if you're into a quick comforting lunch, give it a try.  +ives: value, tasty  -ives: can get really crowded if you show up late"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Churrasco in the city! The rissois are the most addictive and I cannot stop eating once I start. Their sandwiches are super packed with goodness, and while some places stuff it with lettuce and let you down, Churrasco of St Lawrence definitely fill you up with chicken! (I have yet to try the pork of beef - I'm too hooked on the chicken!) Their rotisserie is beyond delicious, definitely a must try (honestly just get 6 of everything and feed yourself for a life). The custard tarts kill me every time, and I have eaten 4 in one sitting (on more than one occasion).

The people who own and work it are a blast! Definitely a must in the city"}
{"text":"Sweet mother of lunch! That is some damn good chicken! Based on the line up for lunch I figured this place must be good but wow. The spicy sauce that they roast the chicken with is so delicious and flavorful. Not much else to say. The place sells amazing chicken and a selection of sides including rice and potatoes and deserts. I'd love to try their custard tarts as they look really good. The only crummy thing about this spot is that its cash only."}
{"text":"Great price for the amount of food you get. Came here for lunch and got the Half-Chicken with potato and veggies. The chicken itself was a little dry, but tasty. The best thing about this place in my opinion is their Homemade Piri-Piri sauce. This place can get very busy with the lunch rush, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"This rating is strictly based on Churrasco's Portuguese egg tarts. 

They are excellent here! They are rich and sweet;  flakey on the outside and perfectly gooey on the inside. The fact that they are less than $1.50 each is an added bonus. 

My tarts that day happened to be sitting on the display for awhile and were not as warm as I would like. Other than that, Portguese egg tarts don't get much better."}
{"text":"Review of the Egg Tarts only

I've been on the hunt for good egg tarts in Toronto. This is the 3rd place that I've tried. I've got to say these are the best so far (in Toronto), although I have had better in other cities. They are priced well, and are pretty tasty. The only problems are:
-they are a little too sweet 
-I wouldve preferred if they were more fresh. They looked like they had been sitting there for a while. 

That being said, if I'm in the area, I won't hesitate to buy some from here again"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! its great juicy chicken, delicious rissois, amazing piri piri sauce.  Always great service with a smile and good value.  I wish they would accept credit cards and not cash only."}
{"text":"I went back yesterday - this time with my husband. 
We shared a Churrasco BBQ Chicken Sandwich that comes with tomato and lettuce for $5.65 and each of us had a riss√≥is as a snack.
Both items were really good and made us want to go back very soon."}
{"text":"I buy the same things every time - the pasteis de bacalhau (cod fish cakes) with the peri peri sauce - yum! Little cod and potato fried dumplings that I can't get enough of. Did I mention that they are gluten free? Stock up!
Oh yeah, they have other stuff that is pretty good, too. My friends like the chicken, the corn bread, and the pastel de nata (custard tarts). They seem pretty happy, so I guess they're good. But the cod cakes are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches here aren't great unless they are made in front of you.  Normally they pull them out of a little fridge, they are wrapped up in plastic wrap, and just isn't amazing.  

If you are going here really the only think you should be looking at is the quarter chicken and half chicken.  Get that, with some of the little potatoes and slather it all with the amazing and addictive Piri Piri sauce.  Seriously I could drink that stuff.  Yes the chicken can be dry sometimes, just depends on when you go, but still a solid place for me.  

I end the experience by getting a 6-pack of the custard tarts to-go.  They are amazing and travel, a nice surprise dessert for dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Portuguese egg tarts are delicious! I think they are about $1.65 each. The crust is crispy and flaky. The filling is more like a thick custard than eggy. Nothing like the chinese style egg tarts, which is exactly how I like them. I've had them in Portugal and these are one of the closest I've found to how they are there. Wish I lived in Toronto to get them more often!"}
{"text":"Good chicken.  Great if you like rotisserie.  Good value. The skin is crispy and the meat is tender. Highly recommend the half chicken meal."}
{"text":"The chicken and rice dish was awesome (and gluten free)!  The house-made sauce was extremely flavorful, even if the chicken was a bit dry for dark meat."}
{"text":"I stopped in here out of desparation, after heading to the market at the end of my workday.  Should have known better than to hit up the St. Lawrence Market on an empty stomach - my bad.

The menu at Churrasco of St. Lawrence is pretty basic, BBQ chicken, BBQ chicken sanwiches, more sandwiches without chicken and Portuguese custard tarts...I ordered their \"famous\" Churrasco BBQ chickens sandwich topped with lettuce, tomato, mayo and hot sauce...the bun was okay, the BBQ chicken was ok, the toppings were...again, ok.  Nothing spectacular.  I'm, not even sure why I even ordered it...I suspect I was absolutely starving at this point and the smell of BBQ chicken just got the better or me.  Overall the sandwich was, you guessed it...ok.  However, the custard tart?  WOW!

Service was quick, prices reasaonable, the sandwich was meh, but the custard tart was fantastic.

Probably not going to hit this place up again for their sandwiches, but I definitely see more of their custard tarts in my future."}
{"text":"Great chicken! 

It is always good, always juicy, always delicious. I always make a note of visiting Churrasco every time I am within a couple of Kilometers. 

I would vote Churassco as the restaurant who serves the VERY BEST ROTISSERIE CHICKEN in Toronto.

I am pretty sure their secret is a very well practiced and maintained family recipe, something that no chain and only a practiced chef with years of experience could duplicate."}
{"text":"Me: I ended up not getting bahn mi. I got Portuguese bbq chicken at the market.

Friend in Niceville, Fla: Showoff. You people and your \"big cities\" and your \"ethnic foods\".

Yeah I guess we're pretty lucky. I didn't have the heart to tell her the next door Jewish deli counter Mano's (ob refrain: Manos hands of fate) is run by Koreans and serves up bulgogi on a bun. That might just send my Niceville, Fla (I'm not even making that name up) friend over the top.

$5+coins gets you a Big Mac sized hunk of BBQ chicken, lettuce, and sauce on a bun. It's juicy. It's sloppy. It's hard to find a place to sit down and eat it. It's a nice break from a Wendy's triple. I went with the cornbread on the side. Of the many things I used to hanker for in Korea was some nice cornbread (you could buy cornmeal in Korea but it was sold in little packets for $5 a packet and really only good for dusting the bottom of your pizza tray). So naturally if I ever see cornbread as a menu option I always take the cornbread. The guy behind the counter warned me it wasn't like American cornbread. It was Portuguese cornbread. Okay. Whatever. Cornbread me. 

The cornbread was a bit of a disappointment. It's not the yellow, moist johnnycake I was expecting. It was a bun with a very very hard crust. One could barely tear it apart. Maybe I'm approaching my Mr. Burns years but I found it hard to tear apart.

I should have gone for the fries. Oh those fries. Big paper sack of fries. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Wow, this was really good! We had a lunch meeting at work so I ordered for 8 people. It came with Caesar salad (the dressing was as good as my home-made Caesar), loads of rice, seasoned roasted potatoes and enough chicken to feed about 15 people :). The chicken was perfectly done...not dry like a lot of places, and so flavourful.  It was an absolutely delicious meal for an amazing price ($12.50 per person)."}
{"text":"The custard tarts were so disappointing. Not creamy, packed with filler and sweeter than they are supposed to be. Definitely not made with the same quality ingredients as pasteis de nata are supposed to be made with. The pastry okay and overall I'd say these tarts are a 4/10 at best.

I had read great things about these custard tarts, so I figured I'd give them a try and picked up half a dozen tarts. The tarts in the display looked fresh and authentic but after I paid, they actually fetched a pre-packed box of 6 custard tarts from what I assume was the back. There was not a single person in line except me and the person at the cash made me wait for them to finish wrapping up two pre-made sandwich platters before helping me. I'd like to come back and try other items but I'm not feeling this service."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for almost my entire life, and it never disappoints. I always order one of the staple enormous chicken sandwiches, which are under $10 and always delicious. The quality has never flagged. I feel like who I assume to be the owner is like some distant member of my family bc I've seen him so many times over the years, lol. Go eat this family's sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Reasonable priced and filling lunch option. Could use a little refining.

I've always heard that the chicken here is good, but had only tried the tarts in the past. The portions are very reasonable, and the price is right, and the sauce is very tasty. Really enjoy how vinegary it is. Sadly the rest of the food is on the overcooked side. Because it was rotisserie chicken I thought it would but safe to get the white meat, but it was pretty dry. Thank god for that sauce! I would try the dark the next time probably.  And the parisienne potatoes were overcooked too, and very soft. As well as the veggies that came with them. I prefer when they have a little more bite, and I've had them mostly that way in the past. The bun that comes with the meal is soft, and I liked it.

Service is really quick (if there isn't a line) and friendly too! Good people making good wholesome food."}
{"text":"This review is solely for the custard tarts. They're the best I've found, and I've tried a whole bunch of these. The best $1.45 you can spend, not that you'll only buy one of them."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Fast, cheap, tasty.  I always get the same thing - BBQ Chicken Sandwich - with extra Piri Piri sauce to pour over it.  Their sauce is homemade, unique, and outstanding - they also sell it by the jar.  I don't live in T.O. anymore, but this is on my list of places that are *must visit* when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"6/24/15:  Came here as part of a food tour to try their Portuguese Egg Tarts and some sort of fried dumpling...

1. Portuguese Egg Tart:  Was okay.  Outside was burnt.  The filling was a tad too molten.  Couldn't remember much else except that my gf makes these far better.  Nothing special.  5/10.

2. (unknown flavor) Fried Dumpling:  Our tour guide did tell us what the filling was, but sorry I forgot.  My apologies.  But I did remember the filling was amazingly yummy.  Cheesy and creamy--can't go wrong with that.  Whatever meat was in their was just for texture, to give the cheese and cream some structure, but the filling as a whole was so good!  Unfortunately I'm not big on the pastry part--kinda soft, and not all that savory.  Not crisp either.  Now, I realize maybe traditionally it's not supposed to be crisp, but well, kinda a waste if you're gonna fry something and not make the shell crispy I say.  But I dunno how it's really supposed to be.  7/10.

Not super impressed overall, but those fried dumplings are worth getting as a snack.

3/5

{"text":"The custard tarts are definitely worth a try!

Aside from that, they mainly sell rotisserie chicken (along with sides of salad, potatoes, fries, etc). Since it's at the main entrance and because they're so quick at preparing food, it's my go-to place for a meal in the market. They give filling portions for plus or minus $10, depending how much chicken you order. Plus, their hot sauce is amazing and the family running it is so sweet!

They don't have any seating specially for them, so everything is takeout, but there are other spots to sit down in the market.

Also, cash only!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say the owner was super nice and was very informative when you ask him about things on the menu. I could spend a hours talking to him just about chicken because I can tell he is very passionate  about it. 

Ok now for the food. I ordered the a half chicken with potatoes ,rice and bread. The chicken for me what a bit dry,over cook, didn't have much flavor. The hot sauce that came with it didn't really help either.   It was however a generous portion of food which I end up  splitting into 2 meals.  Maybe if you get it fresh it might be better?"}
