{"text":"Fantastic food fantastic service fantastic price. Worth the short ride (12$ Uber). authentic ingredients authentic food. Great wines/cocktails. Don't miss it"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Frosty glasses for beer, delicious gourmet pizza, and fabulous service! What a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and they serve fresh authentic Italian food. Pizza and pastas were delicious and I loved the branzino fish. Desserts were yummy and the gelato is a must! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We just had an amazing meal at this new gem. The Gnocchi was pillow soft and delicious. The filet mignon would melt in your mouth and the mushrooms in red wine added another layer of flavor. Then came Cannoli and house made Blood Orange Limoncello.  This was Strip quality food and service at a locals price.  Great choice for any night but we chose it for pre-theatre and we're thrilled it was only a 5 minute drive to the Smith Center!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Jerry's for years.  Recently opened this new Italian gem and boy is it beautiful!  Contemporary style with truly authentic Italian food.  Tonight I sat at the wonderful bar and had the Rigatoni Bolognese and Anchor Steam Lager.  Homemade bolognese with a high quality pasta and a frosty glass of suds.  Some of the best Italian food I've ever had!  If you're looking for great food, a comfortable atmosphere, and very affordable prices, look no further.   

P.S. They carry 57 labels of wine for dine in and to go!"}
{"text":"When I got the email stating that a new Pizzeria had opened at Jerry's Nugget replacing my very favorite I shot my husband a text and said - guess were we are going for Sunday Funday!?  They had only been open a week or so.

The place looks beautiful.  And the bread was excellent.  We started with the meat and cheese platter - it was delicious and beautifully presented.  We both had pizza and they were OK.  I know now after speaking to the manager (?) who asked how everything was that I can ask that they add extra garlic or additional toppings (menu doesn't say anything about that)- cause it was just a little too bland.   

The other thing that I thought was not on par for a restaurant is that they offered us water when we got there - and with the walls full of wine bottles never asked when we ordered our meals if we would care for a glass of wine.  Cause we did care for a glass of wine  :)  And with the walls full of wine bottles - I would have liked a glass of Merlot - but they didn't have that - really?  Had to settle for Cab - which was very good.

Our waitress was very attentive.

So instead of when I feel like pizza - suggesting going to Jerry's Nugget.   If I decide to go to 
Jerry's I will eat here."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a little off the beaten path inside Jerry's Nugget. The food was great & the service was amazing! We had a very large party (30ish) & Giuseppe was so accommodating. He even extended happy hour prices for us. Locals, please patronize this place so it stays around."}
{"text":"A real gem. Beautiful space, fantastic food, superb service and outstanding value. This is worth making a trek to NLV. The casino is also pretty neat, old-school fun."}
{"text":"Contento replaced Uncle Angelo's restaurant inside Jerry's Nugget, which had been a favorite of ours for many years, and which we miss.  Contento clearly aims at being more upscale in décor, and succeeds nicely.  The menu, however, is more limited and pricy than Uncle Angelo's.  This review addresses only the take-out pizza available at a counter directly outside the restaurant's entrance.  In a word, ghastly.  I don't know if it suffered from being in the showcase too long, but frankly I doubt it would have been better even fresh from the oven.  A thick layer of tasteless dough, topped with a miserly splash of undistinguished sauce, topped with unevenly distributed mozzarella.  The pepperoni slices were arranged geometrically, though.  Sorry, but we deposited most of ours in the trash.  RIP, Uncle Angelo."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent wine selection at an amazing price!! You just can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"I was bummed but not surprised to hear this spot had closed. Despite tasty food and warm, friendly service in a gorgeous build-out space, all of Contento's standout qualities couldn't make up for the poor location inside Jerry's Nugget casino.

I visited a couple of times and tried a good portion of the menu- pizzas and all things carby were their specialties. They had an in-house baker and the quality of all things baked was stellar! Pastas and entrees were unfortunately hit or miss for both dine-in and takeout orders, but you could easily make a meal of various apps. Wine list had limited Italian options and mostly sold by the bottle, which limited what I was interested in pairing with my meals.

I am hopeful that the talented kitchen crew and friendly service staff can find a new home in a better location, their food is definitely going to be missed by those who live in the area."}
{"text":"Pizza was great tasting but  the dessert wasn't the best ordered the cheese cake and the cannoli"}
{"text":"Michelle is a wonderful waitress! Very attentive service with a smile 
We all ordered something different and everything was DELICIOUS! A hidden Vegas gem; try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. Wasn't expecting the quality of the restaurant to be this awesome. The free homemade bread is legit. The crust of the pizza is thin and crisp. Cannolis are $5 for 2. Can't wait to go back for the pastas and other pizzas. And they have a take out place which is the spot right next to the cashier and bar. And you can also order to go. 

The prices are really fair for the quality.

Customer service was good. No complaints, very friendly.

It's really a nice hidden gem inside Jerry's Nugget. I hope this place gets more exposure."}
{"text":"Every time we have come the food has been outstanding! The chef frequents the table to make sure everything is above expectations.. This place deserves a real strip location as Jerry's is a little sketchy. The atmosphere shifts 100% as you enter from the casino wow what  a transformation!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some bomb pizza this is the place to go! They import the flour from Italy and they make all the breads in-house, it doesn't get better than that. But wait it does the staff is so nice they make you feel right at home and the desserts are to die for specially the cannolis ! This is a well rounded experience and guys don't let the location freak you out cause you don't want to miss out on a great dining experience because you feel like the location is weird just go!"}
{"text":"Brilliant Italian and very reasonable prices.  Crazy that this place isn't busier and hopeful that people find it quickly.  Pasta bolognese and chicken parmigiana were both fantastic.  Salad was wonderful and service was incredible!"}
{"text":"First of all, excellent and friendly service. A good menu that is not overwhelming, but that includes appetizers, salads, pasta, and pizza-all as upscale and well prepared versions several notches above a standard wings and pizza joint. The pizza is on par with Settebello, and the mixed drinks are extremely well prepared. This is a strip quality restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! I have tried the aracini and a couple pizzas. The dough on the pizzas and the foccacia are excellent. Great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Contento Pizzeria great ambiance for a pleasant italian evening. Authentic service by Italian server Steven"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant pizzeria nestled inside the jerrys nugget casino. The restaurant is cozy new and beautiful. The food was great the lasagna spaghetti and meatballs were excellent. We also ordered salmon and it wad cooked to perfection. The bartender Jeff was gracious and made us some delish drinks. Christina was also very nice."}
{"text":"Contento is new located inside Jerry's Nugget Casino. We came here excited to try a new restaurant with great reviews.  I left wondering if I would ever come back.  The restaurant was completely dead and empty when we arrived on a Friday night.  An empty restaurant should mean excellent service.  But not at Contento. Our server did the best she can.  She brought us to our table, checked on us a few times, and gave us her recommendations.  For an empty restaurant, our food took forever.  A couple that walked in 15 minutes after us even received their food before us.  The check even took a long time. We shared a Caesar salad, side of meatballs, and the complimentary focaccia bread.  The Caesar salad was great.  The bread wasn't anything special unless you love salty bread.  As for the meatballs, the first batch was served cold.  This was not a good sign.  Either our plate of meatballs was literally chillin' in the freezer or they simply forgot to press start on the microwave.  The kitchen fixed the issue and gave us another batch that was cooked.  I got the salmon for my entrée and was pleased.  It was very thick, full of flavor, and flakey.  My fiancé got the chicken parm and it was on the dry side and lacked sauce.  It also was small and served with a few pieces of pasta.  My overall thoughts...this is an Italian restaurant where the salad & salmon is good, but the Italian food needs work. There is just way too many other options for Italian food in Vegas.  I can't say I'm a fan.  Contento is just A-OK."}
{"text":"Waited impatiently for this restaurant to open.  My co-workers and I used to frequent the previous Italian restaurant in this location \"Uncle Angelos\".   Very disappointed in menu, prices and quality of food.  It used to be a fun place but not anymore.  Can get better Italian food at Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, they have fantastic service, great food and they have a great selection of wine. If anyone has a bad experience here is only because they already came in with a crappy attitude. I could not be more happy with this place. Btw try the tiramisu, it is the perfect dessert to accompany the meal."}
{"text":"Very nice place, love the pizza and they also have a nice bar love coming here whenever I'm in northern Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Great prices and amazing food. I love their wine selection and the fact that we can purchase more to take home at retail price."}
{"text":"I was drawn in by the smell of fresh baked pizza. The atmosphere is open and comfortable. 
I had a dinner salad as well and the ingredients are very fresh and the flavors go being well together.
The wines are really good and are paired with perfection.

Until next time contento"}
{"text":"Looks nice BUT...A place like this belongs on The Strip. Expensive and this place caters to locals on a limited budget. Out of place. I tried it but I don't want gourmet toppings. Just ok. Bread 4 a buck b4 and pizza slices also b4 were wonderful. They need to clean this place up. ALWAYS DIRTY casino and smoky. Dirty Dining closed restaurant and the buck stops w the chef who us still in charge??? Chaos at reception counter all the time. Mentioned b4 was told 15min wait at 1130am. Seven tables w customers? SEVEN? Why. Hostess said short on cooks. OMG!"}
{"text":"Visited this evening for dinner and had a awesome overall experience!

We were greeted immediately upon walking in and we were also sat immediately. 

Our server greeted us and was super friendly. Being that this was our first time in, she went over the menu and highlighted some popular items as well as her personal favorites. 

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was amazing. In my opinion some of the best I have had. Not overly greasy or chewy with great flavor. 

I ordered the margherita pizza. The pizzas here are about 11 inches, personal serving size. Again, I was impressed. The pizza was not overly greasy, seasoned well. The crust was light and crispy. The pizza was similar to what you would get at Grimaldi's. 

The pricing was quite reasonable. 

As mentioned, the server was awesome. She was super attentive and friendly. Our drinks never ran dry, she checked on us often. 

I only regret that I didn't save room for dessert.  There is always next time. 

I highly recommend you check this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing service (thank you Michelle) and food! Homemade foccacia and grain bread dipped in oil and vinegar. Ordered the spicy pizza, and my friend ordered the gnocchi, and both were wonderful. For dessert tiramisu and cannoli, I have never like cannoli before and I loved it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"food was top notch, the salad with mozzerella and proscuitto was some of the best ive ever had. the cannolis were perfect. hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Cute Authentic Italian restaurant, with great decor and a super kind staff!  We went for a full dinner with drinks, appetizers, main course and dessert and all was super tasty! I've been dreaming about the 'Burrata Del Sud' Antipasti since we left (I could eat it everyday!!) and I honestly would take a bath in that nights special of risotto, it was so delicious!!  The signature cocktails were very good and the price for drinks (and everything) was not crazy, very fair.  We will be going back with friends."}
{"text":"I just finished eating at Contento during their happy hour and I'm definitely content. The ambience and decor inside the restaurant are nice. I came here specifically to try the pizzas and ended up having the 4 formaggi and margherita pizzas, which are both discounted during HH. The copious amounts of tomato sauce literally drowns out the rest of the ingredients in the margherita pizza and is overpowering. The 4 formaggi, however, was really good as the flavors all complimented one another and balanced each other out.  The pizzas are personal sized and 11 inches each. I was too full to try anything else, but the desserts looked inviting.  They also have a to-go area where you can pick up pizza by the slice.  The service at this restaurant was fantastic. I had three different people checking up on me while I was there. They also put the game on the TV too. I would recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I had high hopes with this new place that replaced my old favorite \"uncle angelos\". We started off well enough, the waitress was promp at the moment got our drinks and everything was okay. My group had a child present so we were hoping to get bread to keep them happy,we didnt find it in the menu so we left at that;we did find it odd the other tables had  bread so we assumed it might come later or with our meal. After the drinks arrived our waitress left us to talk to the crew on the opposite side of the restuarant. I normally wouldnt mind it but seeing the other waitresses so attentive to the other guests made me mildly upset.a new set of guest sat down behind us,the moment they sat down their waitress brought them,i quote \"fresh bread,on the house\" . This got me thinking \"are we not good enough for bread?\" I asked the hostess if we were getting any bread for our table and she responded with that it was only available upon request,i informed her that the guest next to us recieved bread without request,furthermore how can you request something you have no knowledge of i asked. She said it was based on request and what you ordered...but the new guest just sat down..how could they possibly have placed an order before looking at their menu? At this point my party wanted to leave.i wanted to inform to the manager but he was no where to be seen at this point. To make a point,im simply upset that i had such a terrible first experience with people i care about.I hope that they are able to improve upon this;i did not enjoy feeling so alienated at a place i was hoping to be a great place to get quality pizza. I didnt have a chance to try the food,which is a shame it looked extremely promising. In conclussion i would dine in at your own risk in regards to service and would recommend trying the food to go if you wish to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm!!! I had a meatball panini sandwich that was bigger than my head! The French fries were cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection! 
I can't wait to come back and try the pizza next time, because it looked amazing.  
The wine list was phenomenal, and you can even buy bottles to take home in a convenient carrying case!  
The restaurant was easy to get to, because I valeted behind the casino, walked straight, and it was on the right side. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy! The valet is free, and I didn't get lost wandering through a smokey casino, which I feel like always happens to me when I want to eat on the strip."}
{"text":"A gem. It's in a part for town I would rarely venture but after a recommendation from a friend that is VERY serious about his food we headed to Jerry's Nugget to check out Contento.
Was it worth it? Hell yeah.
The place is decorated beautifully, the staff are welcoming. The specials were explained enthusiastically and it is clear the staff here are believers and not simply payroll.
We wanted pizzas so we took a margherita and a diavelo. Bases were really crispy and toppings were simply delicious. We had their antipasto to begin and fresh hot bread with olive oil was also included. The menu is quite extensive with many pastas, meats and fish dishes,  so I'm looking forward to my next visit when I'm not so focused on my pizza craving. 
Glass of Cab, $9 and my son had lots of refills of soda. Water was constantly refilled.
If Contento was a Strip restaurant it would not be out of place but I fear the prices would double. 
This place is worth the trip, prices are good, food is great, staff are delightful and the parking lot is patrolled and valet parking is free. 
Try it, I know I sound like a schill but it's rare to find such high quality food in a beautiful restaurant at these prices."}
{"text":"So this was weird..... took a Lyft from the Airport to eat here since it looked amaze (20 minute ride), walked up with my small carry on roller bag and the security guy out front rudely instructed that luggage was not allowed in. I asked to see if we can check our bag somewhere and he rudely said \"not allowed\" . You may want to note that somewhere dudes, most people in Vegas are traveling FYI. Would have loved to try you, but on to the next place"}
