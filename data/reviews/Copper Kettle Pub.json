{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous renovation! Every detail is charming. Food and service are amazing. Black bean burger was fantastic.if only the new country music was quieter."}
{"text":"AMAZING little country gastro pub.  First off, get 2 orders of onion rings. Yes, you, 2 orders.    Delicious crab cakes, juicy tender chicken wings, and a 9/10 charcuterie board, just missing a pate or rilletes or something meat spreadable.   Great destination for motorcycle rides, cyclists, country adventures, or romantic escapes."}
{"text":"This place has reopened and it's awesome! Great renovation of an old pub with microbrews on tap and a varied and reasonable menu. We had the wings and they were delicious. We will back for more!"}
{"text":"Love the Copper Kettle. Beautiful atmosphere. Amazing renovation done by the new owners. Patio is amazing, the food is upscale casual. The owners are the most friendly and courteous. Had my wife's 40th birthday there a couple weeks after their opening and they served 25 people flawlessly. It's my new favourite pub."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but I don't quite yet. The renovation is awesome, the beer selection is good, and prices are reasonable. The food is not really worthy and service has been very inconsistent.   Food: Crab cakes are great - I wish they would make it a main so you don't have to order a separate salad (more on that later). The daily poutine was good but VERY salty. The burger was fine but more baseball shaped than I normally like. The smoked salmon wrap was horrible. I love smoked salmon and used to think more is better. It's not. They pack so much into this wrap that it becomes overpowering verging on gross. If they put less in (like half), it'd be great. Now the salad. WHY do you put RAW oats on your salad? Who likes eating raw oats? If you're looking for texture, there are so many other things that aren't chewy, bland, and prone to feeling like cement stuck in your teeth. I always forget to ask for no oats and have always been sorely disappointed when my salad arrives with oats. Please stop with the oats.   Service: We've been mid-day on a weekend and were able to get a table on the patio with no wait. That day the service was great. We've also been on weekday and weekend evenings and sat inside. Every time we've sat inside the tables have been nowhere near full but the service has been SLOW. Last time there our beer glasses sat empty at the edge of the table for over 30 minutes (this was before our meal arrived) despite our server walking nearby several times. Unfortunately this is similar to other times seated inside in the evenings.   I really hope the inconsistencies in service are corrected. I also hope they stop putting raw oats on the salads :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an impromptu afternoon lunch and beer. Great chicken wrap and fries. Service was great. The waitress serving us was very nice. Warm and cozy atmosphere with the fireplace going on a cold rainy day."}
{"text":"Copper Kettle is back under new management. Place is bright, airy, and welcoming. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Wow a hidden gem right under our nose. What a lovely place and excellent food. Healthy fresh food with generous portions."}
{"text":"Beer and tap selection is nice. Renovation is fantastic, unfortunately the food falls short. As locals it's our third visit and on average the food has been a miss most times.  Too bad hopefully, it improves going forward. Happy to come have drinks and looking forward to patio."}
{"text":"The good: the soup was tasty. Very sweet and savoury and everything a good soup should be.   The atmosphere is great. Cute custom woodwork, unique stained glass, strange yet wonderful wall treatments  and all set in the midst of a glass studio and art gallery.   The meh: the sandwiches were fine. We had a egg and peameal bacon on a kaiser and a crispy chicken wrap. The kaiser turned out to be a focaccia. That was weird, but I'll take it. It was fine.   The bad: We went in for lunch at just before 2 and weren't done until almost 3:30. Seriously slow service. I was amazed at how slow, actually.   The ugly: This is where it gets gross. My wife ordered a pumpkin cheesecake. It came in a little ramekin straight from a fridge. It was obviously left uncovered because the top layer was dry and stuck to the sides and tasted of fish. That's right, the pumpkin cheesecake tasted of raw fish.   We called over the waitress and asked if they stored their desserts with their raw fish and she said \"I'm not sure, it's my second day\".   When we told her our experience she was shocked. She said she'd have it taken off our bill. Fair enough. No harm no foul.   Aside from the fishy taste in our mouths.   My wife watches over my shoulder as the manager tastes our cheesecake and declares it fine. He doesn't taste anything and he won't be comping anything. The waitress is sent back to inform us that this was the decision.   You read that right. A complaint was sent into the kitchen and the manager sent the server back to tell us to kick rocks. Why not face it yourself, coward!  I inform the waitress that I'd love to discuss it with that manager directly and asked he be sent over. She comes back in a moment to tell us that that manager was too busy to speak with us, but a second manager has overridden the first and comped the fishy cheesecake. She apologizes. That's great.   What I don't know until later is that the first manager is giving us the evil eye the whole time we're waiting for the bill. What a guy.   We won't be back. Hopefully this incarnation of the Copper Kettle doesn't last long. It's too cute a spot to deserve such rude, dishonest, unprofessional and unhygienic ownership."}
{"text":"We strolled in for a drink about 8:30, live music playing.  We sat at the bar and had some whisky with a ginger elixir we brought in.  The bartender and owner were friendly and accommodating.  The girl's food next to us looked yummy.  The restoration is beautiful and authentic looking.  The kitchen is galley style so it can only accommodate so much cooking at once.  You might have a wait for food but it is a local gem, well worth a little time."}
