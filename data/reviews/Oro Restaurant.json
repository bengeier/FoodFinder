{"text":"We were married at ORO on May 18th, 2013.  We chose ORO because the food, staff and owners go above and beyond.  They are consummate professionals. Their Humidor room was the perfect setting, and just the right size for our family and friends to celebrate with us.  It couldn't have been a more perfect evening. The food is fantastic and the wine selection is excellent!  The owners, Domenico and Connie, are EXCELLENT restauranteurs and have a great staff!!  Can't wait to return for another evening of delicious food and fantastic service!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, food ambiance and service. I reserved a table online a few days ahead and I received a charming call the day before to confirm my reservation. I highly recommend dining here and we will go again!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed and at a loss for words. I've been to ORO before, and had a very nice evening. So when it came time to plan a small intimate wedding, we decided to  look into having a reception here. I was delighted to read the good reviews on Yelp, and to find out they had a room that would be well suited for a wedding reception for 30 people.   I called and briefly talked to Domenico, who asked me to send him an email. He seemed hurried, but no big deal. In the email, one of the questions I asked was about bringing in a wedding cake (on the phone, I told him we would still order ORO's desserts as well).   This was his entire reply:  We are in the food business. Would you bring a pair of shoes into a shoe store??????????????  Regards,  Domenico   Domenico Ciccocioppo Proprietor ORO Restaurant 45 Elm Street Toronto, Ontario M5G 1H1 416.597.0155  -------  Now, I think most people tend to wear shoes into a shoe store... but that's besides the point.   I cannot recommend this place based on the service I received."}
{"text":"The food is good but a little pricey! The waitress was really nice! The decor was really modern and had a cozy feeling to it."}
{"text":"My firm does an annual client dinner here every year.  They always do a nice job, but this year they really brought it up a notch.  Absolutely delicious appetizers, well-executed mains, good crusty bread, and can't-say-no deserts.  Ours was an event menu, but if the polenta with truffle oil is on the menu in the dining room DO NOT MISS!"}
{"text":"I have been at Oro for a few times, both for private or corporate functions in the last few years. Never once disappointed. Great ambience and good quality food every time. I agreed with some reviewers that the food may be a tad salty on some courses. I found the waiters are attentive and knowledgeable.  May Bea bit pricey, but a very safe place to impress your guests."}
{"text":"My dining experience in Oro was fantastic.     I had the Australian rack of lamb  as the main dish, number of appetizers and the white chocolate and pistachio semifreddo for dessert.     I am extremely picky when it comes to lamb dishes but without a doubt their rack of lamb is at the top of my list.    We were also served mini foia gras appetizers and it was delicious!      The wine list was amazing and the staff were extremely professional.    There were more than twenty of us that night and we all had an amazing time."}
{"text":"So apparently there is a statute of limitations on reviews here?! Yes, I would say our visit was about a year ago, maybe a bit more. As I just joined Yelp, I wasnt actually able to write a review on a site I WASNT YET A MEMBER OF. Are you going to delete all the good reviews that are more than six months old as well? And are u so blind that u didn't see how much I complimented the food. This is a very good demonstration of how bad your restaurant seems to be with people, even if it is good with food. Why on earth would I write a fake review that said 'one of the best composed dishes I've ever had'. I will happily give you my cell number if u want so you can respond like a man."}
{"text":"Visiting downtown Toronto for an event. Over an hour before they were closing ...the waiter took one look at the Levi 1940s vintage $850 shirt in my hand and refused my son and I service....all over a shirt in my hand . No, I was not bare chested...the shirt was my top layer....we were walking around the city to see the Nuit Blanche exhibitions. My 20 year old son wanted to escape the crowds as I did, popped into Oro . Over an hour before closing, seats half empty, the man that greated us said we would have to wait....no problem. Headed to the rear of the restaurant to whisper to another. Standing there waiting.....the second man comes up to inform us \" THEY ARE CLOSED\" ....I Said \" Excuse me?\" ..\" CLOSED\" Instead of a nice relaxing meal, we went across the street to a quick burger place, watched from the window as they sat 3 more couples over the half hour, and headed on our way . I'm a creature of habit....I find a good restaurant, I stick to it....regarding of the location.... restaurants in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and several in new York know me personally as I travel for business so frequently.....now Toronto being added to my list, their loss . Take my business elsewhere!!! Never judge a book by its cover....biggest mistake someone can make"}
{"text":"I arrived late to a birthday dinner due to traffic. The service was fantastic, the servers set up my setting immediately and got me water and menu.  My group had started eating prior to my arrival so i asked what they recommended, it seems like the group didnt enjoy the food. Most had said that the food was salted heavily so i opted for a pasta dish that no one had ordered at my table.  STROZZAPRETTI PUTTANESCA is the name of my pasta dish, this was recommended by the server and i took his advice.  I took a peek at the wine list and it was truly amazing and the restaurant was small and cozy.  When my pasta came it was a nice portion for the price of $19. It wasnt overally salty as my friends had mentioned that the other dishes were like BUT i found that the quality was the same as something i can get at east side marios or  at  jack astor's so im not impressed.   i think the money can be better spent at a nicer restos that has the same quality of service.  Close to dessert time one of my friend actually mention the salt issue to the waiter and he said that its due to the braising of the meat, but i dont see how that could affect the salmon and other pasta dishes my friends ordered.  it coulda just been an off day... i don't know"}
{"text":"Came here for business dinner back in fall of last year.  It's a cozy restaurant with laidback atmosphere.  I was greeted at the door where the server took my jacket and checked it downstairs.  There were alot of couples and larger groups (4 to 6) so the restaurant was lively under the dim lighting and warm fireplace.      The wine was good.  My dish was seared scallops with risotto.  Both were cooked to perfection.  The scallops were  large in size and just the right tenderness on the inside. The best I've ever had.  The creamy risotto I savoured with the wilted spinach.  It was a very filling dish.  Based on this, I would recommend their seafood based dishes.   Didn't have room for dessert but had an espresso.  Appetizer was good but not memorable or I would be writing about it now and be able to recall what it was...believe it was the the tuna. Had the mint julep drink and it was refreshing but nothing extraordinary.  The stealth service was impeccable.  I didn't even realize when they refilled my wine glass. At the end of the evening the server brought up our jackets and remembered the owner of each.  Thought that was a really nice touch of service.   This is definitely a place for casual business dinners and for mature couples who are looking for a place to unwind and have some good conversation and food."}
{"text":"Taste of the food was good. However portion was a bit on the light side for the price they charge. Ordered the mixed seafood dinner which came with 3 jumbo shrimp, 2 scallops, and some kind of white fish. Tasted good."}
{"text":"Front staff was great. Server was not attentive at all, and we were a party of 8 . It wasn't a busy night so you would imagine the service would have been more complete. I'll explain: one person from our table ordered a glass of red wine and he walked away. We had to call him back to take the rest of the table's drink orders. No smile, no recommendations, and no classy service. He was always rushing away from our table.   We were there to celebrate our work accomplishments and quite baffled by the lack of attention.   The wine we ordered was excellent along with the calamari. Lightly battered, almost reminded me of tempura. Our mains we all ordered was bombarded with too much salt.   Overall we were not impresses and won't be returning. Our bill was over $700 but felt we got much less in service and quality."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch, ambience was probably the best part of my experience here.  The service was ok, it was the very end of lunch so understandable. I am not sure if it was just because of the summerlicious menu or not, but the food was just uninspiring, I left feeling a little disappointed with it."}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant has to be one of Toronto's best kept secrets. It has been there forever and you would think that things would take a turn for the worse as time goes on. Not the case, this place serves the most delicious steak tartare. The service is friendly and efficient and the food is cooked to perfection.Highly recommend the steak and asparagus."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious for dinner, I was a bit unsure how I would like it just because it was a bit quiet. The food came and it was soooooo good. The staff were super nice and generous.   They gave us a dessert wine free since we waited a bit for our dessert to be served. Honestly we didn't mind the wait since we were catching up but it was a really nice gesture, much appreciated.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and would come back."}
{"text":"The food was expensive, and was too salty.  The food was overall ok but definitely did not justify the high price.  Bottomline:  you pay for the atmosphere, do not come here for the food."}
{"text":"Really authentic, even the music is classic Italian. I ordered the rabbit and the flavor was quite nice (although the accompanying sauce was quite nasty). Although next time I think I'll stick to the classic Italian dishes (pasta looked amazing)."}
{"text":"Pass on this place. Food is nothing special. I ordered crispy buffalo mozzarella and got fried cheese bites. For a restaurant like that I expected much better. Staff is very rude. There is one obnoxious waiter with glasses and curly hair. I was with a party of business associates  of over 10 in a private room and despite the fact he was looking at a bill well into the 4 figures, he acted like we were nothing but an annoyance. Recieved same the next lunch I had there. Far better Italian restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"OK, so I was in Toronto on a quick weekend trip with my girlfriend and we wanted to do one really nice dinner. THIS WAS IT!! The food was Italian inspired and DELICIOUS. Please don't let the pictures fool you while the table we had was quite cozy this is located in a store front type local, and the fireplace the show in a lot of pictures is right next to a glass window. So while this is not quite a cozy as it seems from the pictures don't let that stop you.   The STAFF IS AMAZING they genuinely seem honoured that you chose their restaurant. They took our order Lamb shanks for me and gnocchi for the girl, we split a bottle of wine (FYI least expensive bottle of white is about $40 but there is an extensive by the glass list). when the wine arrived I asked fro the cork as my girlfriend collects them, the waiter laughed ( a good hearted chuckle not laughing at me) and before the night was over I think I had a dozen corks. The lamb was SO tasty it is demanded I try to cook it at home and her gnocchi was incredible. When the dessert menu came we asked what the waiter suggested and he said very good and left with our menu, when he cam back he had a dessert wine that paired AMAZINGLY with a dessert plate he brought out. which contained warm nuts in a chocolate dough, a passion fruit sorbee with flour less chocolate cake, and something that was almost a cross between a mousse and a ganouche' that is one of the most delicious things I have tasted in my entire life. BOTTOM LINE: if you have half the experience we did you will not be disappointed. FYI not including dessert 1 pasta 1 lamb shanks 1 bottle of wine 20% tip total was about $130   At the end of the nigh it was pouring out side the door man went down the street and got us a cab then walked me and my girlfirend out individually so we would not get soaked. ABOVE AND BEYOND!!"}
{"text":"Our family of four went there last night before going to see Matilda, and we were all thrilled with the restaurant, which descends from one of the city's oldest and most authentic Italian eateries. Italian restaurants are less open to fusion cooking than French or other great cuisines -- odd given that most elements of Italian cuisine come from elsewhere (ie tomatoes and corn from Mexico).  But here there's lots of innovation and borrowing, which I really applaud. The drinks list offers  a range of craft ciders and beers, as well as Italian offerings. One of the appetizers is a variation on Indian sag paneer. One of the main dishes has Thai spicing. Almost needless to say, the cooking is excellent. I had a pasta with dandelion pesto -- what a great use of the Italian foraging tradition. The mascarponi dessert had all four of us sharing and groaning in delight. The service is formal, but it doesn't take long before it becomes friendly. The seats are extraordinarily comfortable. Altogether, a great place for a special evening."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, good wine, generous portions and attentive service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the wine list was incredible with sevearal ORO wines listed.  I had this amazing Lake Huron White Bass that was grilled with seasonal vegetables and I have to say there was nothing left on my plate.  The dish was light, flavorful, and well seasoned.  My husband also enjoyed his baked penne which was a little heavier, but very tasty.  However, nothing compared to the delicious and satisfying Lemon Trifle.  This is one of my favorite desserts ever and a MUST for anyone who likes lemon desserts.   The restaurant itself was lovely and located in downtown Toronto not too far from the lively and bustling Yonge Dundas Square.  The decor was warm and beautiful, but the service was just okay.  They quickly refilled our water glasses and brought us more bread while we were waiting for our entrees, but the service lacked the welcome and warmth you would like to see at a restaurant of this pricing.  Food was delicious, dessert astounding, but the service could have been better!"}
{"text":"If you like good pasta, this place is for you.  My friend and I came here recently, and, thanks to Yelp, we had a wonderful experience.   Following advice from past reviews, we ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi and Pappardelle Bolognese... Both dishes were extremely well made, the gnocchi having more savoury and spice to it, and the bolognese having a jambalaya-reminiscent topping that was surprisingly elegant.   However, other things we tried were relatively lacklustre - I found that the flavours in the octopus salad were not well balanced, being predominantly acidic and a little bitter (but not subtle enough to pull it off). The lemon trifle was also unimpressive.  Overall, I give 4 stars because I still fondly recall the gnocchi I had here (my friend actually preferred the bolognese though), as well as the interior. The pictures actually do not do it justice - the interior is beautiful, with a touch of elegance that is somehow both modern and rustic. The service was also pretty good.   I will come back when I have about $25 to spare for a plate of delicious pasta. And I will suggest it to every guy I know for a date place to impress a special girl."}
{"text":"Space is nice, service was great.  The frisee salad with nuts, goat cheese and poached egg was delicious.  The mushroom pasta was very dry and very miserly with the mushrooms.  Not very flavorful either."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly even though we were early for our Saturday evening reservation. We began with Presecco.  It was nice and quiet so it was easy to hold a conversation.  The service was good from the professional wait staff.  We began with a caprese salad and beer battered squid.  For mains we had the veal and the black cod.  The food was as good as one would expect in a family owned Italian restaurant.  We drank a Ripasso and an Amarone.  The Amarone was delicious.  We finished the evening off with some delicious Grappa.  Overall it was a very pleasant evening.  It was over priced but then we were down town Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendations of alot of people but I have to say I was disappointed with the food.  Ordered the mussels and linguine daily special pasta and their gnocchi..  The linguine had too much going on and not anything positive.  It was a mess of corn, spicy peppers, tomato peels, I think lettuce anf onion and probably 5 other ingredients!  The sauce was too watery as well.  The gnocchi was extremely disappointing as there was too little sauce, and either fennel seeds or shaved peanuts! What authentic Italian cuisine adds that to mask the flavour of the tomato sauce!  Too weird...  The calamari was tender but paying 15$ for it and having plain iceberg lettuce on the bottom was also disappointing..  The only saving grace here was the servers were extremely attentive and kind, always checking on your water and clearing the food quickly.  Of note: their bread comes with olive oil that is soaked in garlic...but they should just stick with what works.  Use balsamic man!"}
{"text":"Excellent...in every way.  Best italian food in the city...gorgeous decor, attentive, appropriate staff...great meeting rooms."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  At first I was a little hesitant because the place was so quiet... but once the food came out everything changed. AMAZING.  Glad I took customers and co-workers here -- everyone was blown away. A real diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Toronto for a vacation, and I was looking for a good restaurant close to our hotel when I found Oro. We arrived at the front door and, because there are two steps up and my wife was in a wheelchair, the server, led us around back so we could easily roll directly into the restaurant and to a table at the front. (This allowed us a fantastic view of most entertaining traffic patterns, such as two people doing 3-point turns in opposite directions.)  The servers were very attentive and the food was top-notch. I had the Crab and Scallop Cake, which was delicious, and I followed it with the linguine (with shrimp, etc). This was also quite good, and I felt I had made an excellent choice.   I would recommend this as an excellent place for a quiet romantic or vacation dinner."}
{"text":"I went on a deal voucher to this place, but man was I disappointed.   I guess the only upside was the fact that I didn't have to pay full price for my meal. The food was uninspiring and cold. I had the Bass and it was poorly served with almost raw vegetables on the side. My girlfriend had the pasta, and it was very bland. The waiter was helpful, but not very attentive. We were left in a corner of the restaurant and almost forgotten. I had to wave him down in order to get his attention. I left feeling full, but disappointed.   I know I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything was just ok, nothing really special, even food was ordinary. Overall considering the price range I say it's overrated."}
{"text":"Oro is simply overpriced. We went to Oro because we had a groupon and wanted to try it out; it was disappointing. While the ambiance is romantic and cozy, the entrees had seemingly ordinary ingredients and were yet expensive. For an appetizer, a plain arugula salad was $14.95. It came with preserved mushroom, marinated artichokes, caper berries, roasted garlic, Grana Padano and a sherry  vinaigrette. It was just fine, nothing special. I could have made this at home:)  For the main course, I ordered Venison Loin and it was okay. Once again, nothing unique or flavorful...$36.   The wait staff was helpful.   Overall, as a Torontonian, I would say, Toronto has amazing high end restaurants with a great choice of entrees if you are willing to spend that much- For example, try Jump."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here often with a colleague that is quite allergic and they have been able to accomodate him while making a great tasting meal every time. The ambiance is extremely modern and the food is delicious however it is not cheap."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant when Groupon had a deal and decided to give it a try on a week night and I was very glad I did.  The environment of the restaurant is amazing, although a bit quiet because it was during a weekday, but the lighting, seats, setting were so elegant and upscale.  My friend and I ordered two main courses and a dessert. I went with the Beef Ribeye, my friend ordered the Butter Braised Lobster and we shared a Tiramisu Panna Cotta for dessert.   The ribeye was amazing with very strong flavor, but what impressed me the most was the mashed potatoes. A mixture of potatoes, bacon, leek and olive was surprisingly a good blend and the combination created an amazing taste. The lobster was very fresh and it came with black rice mixed with coconut milk, which was also surprising a very good combination. The dessert was very unique, Tiramisu made into a jello-like (never had something like it before).  Although this is one of the more pricier restaurants I had been to, but my logic is this. If the service, food and environment were all good, I do not mind paying the premium; and Oro was well worth the premium!!   I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"It's quiet, beautiful and feels very private it's great for quiet dinners. The food was great & the service was great."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It was a last minute find for my birthday celebration. The decor is beautiful. A very elegant European feel with beautiful floors and detailed installations on the walls. A great place to take a date or a celebration.  We ordered:  Appetizer: Antipasti A selection of in-house cured meats Italian cheese, marinated seasonal vegetables, and condiments $16.00 - beautifully displayed and the pairing of taste was great.   Mains:  Gnocchi di Ricotta Braised brisket, caramelized onion fresh horseradish tomato sauce, basil, and woodland mushrooms $22.00 - my friend had this dish. she thought it was very tasty!   Crispy Catfish New potatoes salad with basil aioli, grilled asparagus, and marinated tomatoes $24.00 - this was delicious. the crispy catfish was not too salty and very crispy indeed. The potatoes were in a basil cream sauce which was amazing!  Mixed Seafood Platter Risotto, roasted cauliflower, and steamed broccoli $35.00 - my other friend had this dish. It was served in a dish and not as big as we imagined for $35, but it tasted wonderful! (but i probably wouldn't pay for this, not sure if it's worth the money).  Dessert:  Baked Alaska Molasses cookie and toffee cake ice cream $8.00 - this was amazing! the texture was awesome!! it looked like a white volcano with melted ash! amazing dessert! They were able to preserve the ice cream inside and the ginger cookie that it was the base gave a very refreshing taste!  YOGI TEA Aromatic and stimulating herbal blend with citrus peel, chamomile, orange blossom, lemongrass, spearmint, hibiscus and rosehips  PEPPERMINT Mint Infusion  The teas were served in these beautiful small kettles. They were very strong and flavourful!   The service was awesome! The staff was very welcoming and gave some good recommendation for food!  The washrooms were beautiful! Very nicely decorated and clean!!! This was a pleasant find indeed!!! :D Will be going back and bringing others to try!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with my work colleagues. Ambience is spectacular and quiet with just a few tables so it does not get very noisy or crowded. Very friendly waiter who took our jackets as soon as we entered and promptly took us to our table. Very attentive of our needs with the water and explained items from the menu. Definitely on the pricey end for an afternoon lunch, so the pastas would be a good option at around $17-22.  I opted for the venison ragu ravioli which was a great option. Very flavourful and nicely done with great presentation. Based on recommendations from other yelpers one of my colleagues opted for the ricotta gnocchi. It was quite delicious, with the only complaint being that the dish seemed to be the \"same\" flavour with each bite. Even then, still a good option.  The only drawback I had was at the relatively slow service. For a smaller restaurant with only two other tables occupied, I didn't expect to wait as long as I did, hence the one star off. However I definitely recommend this place for a once in a while \"nice\" lunch or dinner. Will return to try dinner options."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely wonderful. We came here for summerlicious and though there was a fixed menu we had plenty of options to choose from. The portion size was huge. I had the beef ziti for an app which could have very well been a full meal. My gf had a wild mushroom salad which was perfectly seasoned and just delightful. We both had the chicken parmesan for dinner which was again just wonderful.  My favorite part of the meal?? The service hands down! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was here for summerlicious 2015 and I loved it! The cat fish was great but what I will always remember is the chocolate panna cotta with orange and a cherry on top it was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Went here on a chilly rainy day.  A friendly greeting at the door, took our wet coats and sat us by a beautiful wood burning fireplace - nicely lit an cozy.  Have been here three or four times now and have never been disappointed.  Strip loin steak was very tasty, well seasoned and served with asparagus, mushrooms and potato.  Mushroom soup always tasty as is their romaine and other starter salads.  Service always friendly and accommodating.  There's a lot to be said for a consistently well prepared meal!"}
{"text":"I had such a pleasant experience at Oro. What really makes the place stand out for me is the service. The waitress and waiter we had were so attentive, we carried full on conversations with them. We were visiting Toronto, and the waitress even wrote down a little list of other restaurants we should go to on some post-it notes. It really made this charming restaurant shine on our visit to Toronto.  These are the dishes we had:  - Ricotta gnocchi - I like well made gnocchi, and these were quite good. The mushrooms added a little savory, nutty flavor to the dish, and the duck complimented the dish.  - Pappardelle Bolognese - This dish had a hint of spice to it, and I really am a sucker for perfectly done pasta.  Overall, a lovely experience. Canadians really are nicer!"}
{"text":"Place was decorated great. Quiet atmosphere and romantic. We had Gnocchi and trout. They were both delicious. Also had the calamari and it was  good. We had Maple Creme brûlée for desert and it was oh so delicious. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"An excellent Italian restaurant in the hospital district - this has been a mainstay in the area for years.  One highlight is definitely the service - some of the waiters have worked here for more than 20 years and you can definitely tell.  They are friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable.    The food was very good as well. I actually had a steak, which was excellent, and a spicy cream zucchini soup.  The unbaked cheesecake was not to my taste, but some people enjoyed it.  There's really nothing to complain about here - high quality Italian food!"}
{"text":"Good - food was good not amazing; service was great   Bad - both me and my friend had stomach aches after. Based purely on both of us getting sick after I would say you should go somewhere else"}
{"text":"We had a lovely time at Oro. The service was excellent and the food was amazing! We had antipasto at first, then I had pasta of the day and my boyfriend had the veal meatballs. For dessert my boyfriend had the pannacotta! I would absolutely come again and recommend the place to people who love Italian food!"}
{"text":"On Fri 2014-04-04, 4 of us (and 1 baby) ate dinner at this Italian restaurant. Overall it is an excellent restaurant. The food and service were excellent.  We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 wines, 4 entrees, 2 desserts, 1 latte, and 1 tea. Please see my photos to see what we ordered.  When I reserved online, I specified that we needed a table that where we could put a baby stroller beside it and that I would be taking photos of the food (ie, don't want to disturb the other guests too much). It turns out they have 2 dining areas. They were only 50% full that night so they put us in the 2nd dining area and all other guests were in the first dining area!  What service!  Our waiter was knowledgeable and very attentive."}
