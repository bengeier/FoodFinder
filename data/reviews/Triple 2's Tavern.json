{"text":"Great service from a cute waitress.  I was there to watch a bowl game and they fired it up for me with audio and everything.  Fun environment and great food and staff."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is AWESOME. Went there for lunch on Sunday and even with the  NFL starting back Ashley ( hope that's spelled correctly Ash ) service never suffered. Great pretzels and cheese sticks for App. Wife had a pizza she said it was awesome. I had the steak sandwich. It was awesome. It's a diners, drive in and dives place.  Oh and the beer prices are awesome...   HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest visiting we will be back many more times for sure.."}
{"text":"Fun place to go. Always a fun crowd. service is fair, food is fair. The world needs more neighborhood hang outs like this. Music is decent too. This place is always our back up plan if we don't know where to go. Friday is the best day to go. all day happy hour."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood bar. Good service. Went in about 900pm on a Friday night hoping for Karaoke as mentioned on Yelp, but none to be found. :("}
{"text":"Every time I go here the food is phenomenal (especially with their new menu that just came out) and so is the service! It's definitely refreshing to go to a bar and getting great food AND service, I don't live close but it's always worth the drive! Just wish I could give more stars!"}
{"text":"This place is less than \"meh\". Service wasn't great. Food was less than great. They have cold beer and and like 37 TV's or whatever. So that's something I guess... Basically, it's analogous to going to the prom at the last minute and all the hot girls are spoken for. So you just kinda settle. But then you regret waiting until the last minute...because you could've found something better if you would've just planned things out just a tad better."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE WAITRESS.....Never do I do bad reviews but I'll make an exception. Went there tonight, it was prob my third time there. Good environment good food.but tonight was horrible. Went with my boyfriend && we sat in a 4 people table. Took the waitress about 15 min to come by to get our drink order. She seemed angry but we ignored it. Brought back drinks prob 10 min after that. (Not exaggerating) then I ordered a burger (well done) Burger comes back with red. I tried to get the waitresses attention but every time I did it was always the \"one min\" response. Finally I stopped trying to call her over. She finally came to the table,no joke about 15 min later to ask how everything was. At this point I was over impatient. so my boyfriend ordered another beer && I decided to get one as well. Also decided to re order my burger. 7 min later my food comes (burnt patty) literally burnt.!!!! I didn't even bother with the food anymore. Yet our beers no where to found. She comes back 5 min later asking us if we would mind if 2 people sat with us, at this point I was irritated && in no fault was it the people who were waiting for a table fault but I was so angry with the waitress already I told her \"no, I don't want anyone sitting with us\" keep in mind these are 4 people tables (small && cramped) tables.... She continued with the worst attitude and says \"too bad we need to fill up the bar..\" Seriously what was the point of asking then.? I was beyond livid. My boyfriend just said \"ok I guess we will be okay with two strangers here.. just bring us our beers that we ordered 20 min ago\" && she said she forgot.!!!! Really.?! She was the worst waitress I had ever dealt with.. When we were heading out the people in the next table said \"yea we feel the same way about her, we are heading out too\" BECCA was the name on the receipt. Horrible service from her. Not going back because of her. Don't say you weren't warned."}
{"text":"Very good food! We got a burger and it was great. Good quality meat and tasty. Fries were excellent. Similar to steak fries.   We also got honey BBQ wings and they were really good as well.   Kids got pizza. It wasn't great, honestly. And the salad was pretty good but had some rotten pieces.   Overall very good!  Update: I have to take a star off. I've been here twice in the last month and ordered a medium rare burger and it came out well done both times. Once was take out so I couldn't even send it back!"}
{"text":"Just came to grand opening for Triple 2s Tavern. The food was really great, burgers were cooked to perfection and the wings were excellent too. kid friendly during the day and a BIG difference from the original bar/restaurant it used to be. Owner was very engaged wanting to know what our experience was like ... will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"So my first night walking was the first night they had live music. Elbow to elbow packed....uhhhh. I'm instantly annoyed and 100% of the time I would turn around and walk out, BUT my wife wanted to watch the band.  We walked up to the bar and surprisingly it being 2 deep the bartender quickly made eye contact with me and took my order......BIG PLUS. Kudos to that. My wife sideled up to a table (Sienfeld reference) and made friends with people sitting there and luckily within minutes took their table as they were paying the check. Waitress came over as soon as we sat down to get us another drink (YEAH another big plus). Although we didn't order food, it looked like your typical bar menu, fried food and cheeseburgers. Sadly they had a very poor draft selection, in this day and age you expect a ton of choices when you go to a bar or even LOCAL BEER.....but sadly it's Bud light, bud, coors light etc........ This is where I start to pout and say........\"just bring me a Mich Ultra\" and then I sulk at the table and don't order another drink. (beer snob) SO........I was going to give 3 stars because the bar was just ok, but the staff were total ROCKSTARS that night being attentive, and that goes along way with me. Keep up with the live music.....we'll be back."}
{"text":"After seeing triple 2 tavern winning  best wing at wingstock 2016 I decided it has to be the real deal.  I had tried some other wing places in the city that were winners at wingstock and they were tasty.   I guess you can say I was going on a wing binge because I drove almost 40 minutes to try this award winning wing.   Lets just say I was highly disappointed in the food.   The service was absolutely great!   That is the reason for the 3 stars.   Me and a friend ordered the appetizer rolls,  they were nasty and tasted awful.   We weren't concerned with that,   The real reason we came was for the wings.   So we ordered the maple bacon wings.   Disgusting!   Undercooked and under flavored!   We had ordered some teriyaki wings that were subpar,  so we told the waitress we didn't like the maple wings and she came back with a mountain of teriyaki wings.    She was very nice and the owner or manager was also!   I wish the food was good,  I would have loved to give them 5 stars.   Great service and a great place to watch the game and have a beer.   The food was just awful."}
{"text":"This place has changed it's name so many times, but one thing remains...they have tasty bar food. We ordered pizza slices, mozarella sticks during HH and they were so greasy good lol AND CHEAP! I ordered a Shrimp po'boy and it didn't disappoint. The food is greasy, beer cold, and lots of TVs for all types of sporting events. Staff is friendly. Outdoor patio seating and smoking area, along with bag toss. It's definetly a sports bar/pub atmosphere, so expect casual atmosphere and CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Seemed like our waitress was the only person waiting on the entire restaurant and bar inside and out. We had to go to the bar a few different times to order drinks and food as she rolled silverware. Not her fault. Management and ownership definitely needs to get their crap together. We gave the waitress a decent tip even though the service is not that great. We felt  bad for her. The food was good and drinks were decent. We only got appetizers.we would've definitely got more food and drinks it was just too hard to get waited on. Very fun place and fun crowd."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the menu.  There aren't as many options as there used to be.  My favorite sandwich was one of those discarded in the revamping of the menu.  So, no cheesesteak, no steak/mushroom & cheese, no Cobb salad, no pasta.  They did keep the Italian, which is now called the bada boom.  That one is also good, just not my first choice.  You can still get pizza & wings, but it doesn't appear that mushrooms or black olives are available as toppings???  I tried ordering the skinny dip this past weekend (which sounds like a French dip) but was told they were out of beef. The week before I had ordered the pulled pork extreme fries, hold the onion.  Guess what?  Yep, it came with the onion straws.  They did add a few sweet items, so that was a plus.  The menu isn't all bad.  The food that is left is still good.  One can only hope they take a hard look at the menu and do some tweaking."}
{"text":"Great place to go in a Saturday night! Love the live music! Didn't give the full 5 stars because the waitress took a little too long to notice when we needed a refill on our drinks. But the atmosphere is fun! Keep up the music!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the buy one burger get the second burger half price on Saturday, but apparently you can't take it home.  They refused to sell me a second burger for half price."}
{"text":"Awesome...... found a new hang out to spot that's better than native new yorker.... friendly yet satisfying the server was awsome food  was more than great definitely will be back for more thanks for making my first round a day to remember...."}
{"text":"Well, where to begin....the wife and I were looking for someplace different in the east Gilbert area and thought we'd give this place a try. We went at about 4 pm and the place only had a few guests when we arrived (got busier while we were there). The dining space was decent and it has an ok tv situation for sports etc. However, the menu was lacking, the food wasn't great, and the service was terribly slow. I'm pretty sure only one server/bartender was working, but there was a clear \"manager\" present who didn't do a thing but speak profanely to a regular at the end of the bar. With all of the competition in the area, we will continue to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time ever the other day and the adorable waitress with tattoos and long, pretty hair walked up to me with a sweet smile and confirmed that I wanted a margarita on the rocks.  I was in utter disbelief that she remembered my drink order from the one other time I'd been in, a couple of weeks prior, but I guess somehow she did.  Plus the margarita was delicious, and perfectly mixed.  Very impressive service!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday , very crowded , ok service and ok food ......My beers were ice cold but my sisters mixed drinks lacked flavor"}
{"text":"The food is deeeelish!  Great bar atmosphere. I can't wait 2 keep coming back to try the rest of the menu.  Maybe not the aligator but my boys are into it.  This place is fun.  Bathrooms could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Been in after work a few times.  Service was slow when I arrived alone, seemed to speed up when my party joined me.  Not a good sign.  Food was served quick, fair but not great, reasonably priced.  But, I will give high praise to the Bomb shots and Mini's!  Very creative, flavorful, and good price.  Waitress explained and made suggestions and those alone are enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"The best thing about Triple 2s is the staff. But the bar food staples, pizza and wings well they can't be beat. I have had about the entire menu and it is not just thrown together like most bar food. $4 apps are a great deal like the fried pickles etc. If you live close this should be your hangout."}
{"text":"K and I had some time while we waited for C to finish his rehearsal so we decided to stop in and give Triple 2's a shot. We managed to be in time for happy hour as well.  K had the seasonal brew ($4.75 for 25oz) and I had the Devils Ale ($4.75 for 25oz). Both beers were cold and our server Allison did a nice job of taking care of us.  We also sampled a couple of the happy hour food items. The mushroom caps ($4.00) were a great value because there were a good number of caps for the price and we tried 6 boneless wings ($4.00). Too much breading and the sauce was a bit cloying. About a C on the bar food grading scale.  Nice Server. Average food. Good beer selection. Fair happy hour prices. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Man, this place SUCKED! The only reason it's getting a second start is b/c at least it was clean.  The wings were terrible: hardly any sauce on them and the sauce they did have were just a shade shy of being pure vinegar.   The waitress was horrible. A food runner brought our food, and the waitress never came back to check on us. So, she didn't find out 'til it was too late that they'd forgotten my fries.  The beer selection is horrible -- all football beers. For a neighborhood bar to have such a poor selection is too bad.  The seating is weird. It feels like you're on top of the tables next to you -- no privacy at all.  My wife didn't even eat her food (fried shrimp, I think?).  Ugh, I was so disappointed. Really wanted to like this place."}
