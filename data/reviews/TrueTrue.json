{"text":"Tired TrueTrue pizza today and I am a fan. I tried the Into the Wild and would suggest it to anyone who is a mushroom nut! Also tried the Date Night and loved the sweet barbeque sauce on it. Looks like I will be gaining some weight."}
{"text":"TrueTrue has kept, well, true to what it was back when it was OnePizza.  This is probably my favourite make-your-own pizza joint in Toronto. It has such a great selection of ingredients, including ones you wouldn't normally find at a pizza place, like falafel and goat cheese. And, most importantly, toppings aren't extra.  The charming woody decor has since changed into a more retro-futurism thing that they have going on, which isn't necessarily bad, just a very different in terms of atmosphere.  I miss that they got rid of the order sheet with all the ingredients on it, but the servers here are so nice that I don't mind all that much.  A pizza paired with a Mexican coke here is just bliss."}
{"text":"One pizza was excellent. I had the Donnie Brasco and my boyfriend had the Aloha Smoke. The fennel sausage on my pizza was excellent. The crust thin and delicious! The Aloha smoke pizza was the best twist on Hawaiian I've ever had. The pineapple salsa on it added delicious sweetness and heat.  A must try for those who worship pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza selections or you can make your pizza to satisfy your own appetite.  Crispy pizza crust and good ingredients also."}
{"text":"Really good concept for a build your own pizza.   Seems reasonably priced ($12) for a one-size unlimited topping pizza that has a pretty fast turn around time from when you order to when you get the pizza.  I've ordered the Donnie Brassco a couple of times.   I would recommend."}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Would have liked to have more (quantity) of toppings for a 12$ pizza, but still a decent spot and good casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic! Perfect for individual lunch portions. If coming for lunch, there's a bit of a lineup so be warned. However, definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best eatery in King East Service is very friendly, fast. Price is reasonable Will come back for more :)"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's I ever had,   Especially since you make your own pizza they have tons of yummy fresh natural ingredients you just choose what you want: what type of Doe what toppings the oil extra. Then they make a home made pizza with a wood pizza oven (yummy). But sadly they do not have the best drink choice."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty pizza!! I like how you can actually watch them make your pizza from scratch. And with a $1 something extra you can add any veggies you want. I ordered my Donnie Brasco with arugula and they put so much of what I expected."}
{"text":"Great value, reminds me of an Italian WIlbur in the east, would visit any time!  Building your own pizza just works!"}
{"text":"This place has great design your own pizza. Topping selection is great and you can choose whatever you like included in the main price (except more cheese).   The place itself is very nice considering it is counter service. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This place figured out Fast food pizza.   Absolutely delicious for an on the go pizza that's beyond the boring toppings. It's like a Chipotle for pizza.  When you walk in, just ask what they recommended and get that.  Wine and beer on tap is a bonus."}
{"text":"This new place follows the trend of personalized pizza with premium toppings. I like the structure and all you can eat which is reasonable for $11.86, but wouldn't consider it cheap. The good is that there are lots of unique, premium toppings. The service was fast given it wasn't busy. The bad was that the pizza wasn't that great. It was all crust, with limited toppings in the middle. The aristocrat was dripping in oil, and the hunt & peck was peppery but not much more to it.   I've tried a few of the other new restaurants with the same concept and this one still has some improvements to make. I'd much prefer a pizza from one of the big chains (Nova or even Pizza Pizza) or Terroni. Still, the convenience and customizability is probably the best part, so I'd go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Great pizza options (create your own, $11.86 no matter what toppings you choose) with beer & wine on tap. Great addition to King East!   The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the bathrooms were pretty dirty and my chair at the table still had crumbs on it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Delicious ingredients. One price for pizza and any number of toppings. Bottomless soft drinks. Nice decor. Free WiFi.  Work gang loved it. Will be one of our new goto lunch spots."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had in my life. Couldn't take more than a few bites, felt like I was eating the cardboard the pizza came in."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with friends. The line moved quickly. The service was friendly. The ingredients seemed both fresh (fresh mozzarella) and interesting (pineapple salsa). While we were eating, one of the employees came to the table to ask how everything was, just like in a full-service restaurant. Cleat they are trying to cater to a short-on-time crowd that wants a meal normally not meant for short-on-time crowds, like gourmet pizza. The pizza was good - not incredible but definitely passable, one par with the pizza at the Marche. What really sold me was the quickness, the choice, and the service. If you live in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"Walked by randomly and the place looked hipster enough to walk in and check out.  It's like a subway sandwich shop with long flat bread pizzas. Simple ordering menus with wine and beer avail.  Ordered the peck and hunt pizza which included eggs and ham.  Good but a little salty. Dough was ok.  Way better than a grab a slice and go place but had tosta quick fire pizza a few days ago which has a similar concept and that would be my choice if they were side by side. Would def come back here though."}
{"text":"Build your own pizza establishments are popping up in the city with this being one of the first. Choose from 7 curated pizza's or select your own toppings. Visited with a group of coworkers with plenty of seating available. Order/build your pizza, pay and let it cook. I chose build your own and found the amount of toppings dressed were inconsistent with other pizza's prepped. Overall great flavours with fresh ingredients. I found the dough a little hard and thick- I prefer thin crust. As others have said, also found it slightly too salty. Whole wheat and gluten free available.   Wine and beer on tap. Only a few options available.   I visited a few months ago with pizza's at $11.86 plus taxes- since raised all pricing by $1.  With so many new pizza joints popping up in the city I'll look elsewhere for my pie fix."}
{"text":"I went back recently after their re-launch. Sorry but I really don't dig the new renovation...it's borderline tacky and WHY, why changed something that was working so well! The previous decor was chic and welcoming at the same time.   There are less toppings available to choose from for the build-your-own pizza. Prices seem to be marginally higher after the change.   The colour scheme is hideous in my opinion. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"So happy this is in our neighborhood now!  Price: $14 inc tax to create your own pizza. Can't go wrong with that in the city.   Service: awesome! Friendly, knowledgeable, funny, hip.  Food: divine! Egg on pizza is a sin omggg.   Atmosphere: modern, industrial and CLEAN."}
{"text":"Ordered two customized pizza but they only gave me one. I called them and a lady with cute voice said she could make one and send it to me. When I received, I got 3 beverages as a compensation. AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"It's like going to a real fancy bistro-esque Subway, where the food is pizza but your toppings are not limited!  There is no front wall menu - when you come in,  you grab a little paper one to glance over and you can decide what you want as you wait.  Everything is fresh, including the dough being raw at the start. There is a medley of interesting ingredients to choose from like falafel or date. They have a list of their own pizza inventions you can choose from and then build on, or you can start from scratch. The first set of ingredient roll through the little oven and get cooked with the dough, and then there is a second set of ingredients that can go on after.  It's really fun and totally worth the price. :)"}
{"text":"$21 for a large pizza (recommended for 2)?  Not bad.  Got the Donnie Brasco to go, which was recommended by the staff as \"the meat lovers choice\".  Each squared slice had a careful dollop of ricotta on top, which was nice to have so that my dining partner and I didn't have to fight over those bits.  Crust is not too thick, which was nice.   Only thing is that staff didn't know everything about the ingredients (ie: Questions on about the cheese types), but they were kind enough to ask the manager who knew the answer.  A decent choice for a quick bite."}
{"text":"A great addition to a trendy neighborhood. One Pizza, as the name suggests, has one pizza size. It is a rectangle-shaped pie that you can load with as much toppings as you want. The crust is quite thin.  I really liked the vibe of this new place - lofty hipster feel - great decor.  Staff were really friendly and made a point to get to know us (as any new business should).  Overall it was very clean.  The Good:  1. Decor. Very nice, casual resto - different than most pizza places. 2. Taste. Fresh ingredients and whatever you want to put on it. 3. Staff. Friendly and really tried to get to know us.  The Bad:  1. Size. We didn't think the size of the pizza was very big - we were both still kind of hungry afterwards - especially for the price of it + tax and tip.  Recommendation: try out this new, hip resto when you have a pizza craving. It's a totally new concept and pizza only takes 2 minutes to cook!"}
{"text":"While I was a big fan of this place when it was known as \"One Pizza\" I feel the recent reno and rebrand has complicated things unnecessarily. Gone is the wall seating, large communal tables and convenient printed menus from which I could choose my toppings.   The feel of the restaurant has been moved a bit upmarket which is fine, but I'm not sure why there is no list of toppings available or labels on any of the containers. This means the server has to either walk you through every topping or you need to figure it out yourself before ordering.   While it might still be unlimited toppings on a personal pizza for around $12, the new ordering method slows things down and also means you get less toppings since you are being rushed through the ordering process.   Don't get me wrong, it's still the best pizza in the area, I'm just not sure what was wrong with the old formula."}
{"text":"Love this place and their pizza. Thin crusts and great combinations of toppings. The restaurant is really nicely done up. It is a little pricey but well worth it"}
{"text":"This review is strictly based off food not restaurant service.  I ordered two custom pizzas from true true via foodora  on a Sunday night. Not sure what had happened but it took an hour for the pizza to even be prepared. Total 1.5 hrs to be delivered to my home.    Nonetheless, the pizza was absolutely amazing. You can select from a generous selection of gormet toppings. Basically if you want to make a fine Italian pizza or a more americanized pizza the choice is really up to you.  I was so surprised that they topped my pizza with a great amount of toppings (no skimping out at all) the blue cheese is delicious and so flavourful. I must say every topping is delicious!  $12.86 for a personal sized custom pizza with unlimited toppings. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great pizza place that is part of the AYCT (All you can topping) trend.  Their ingredients are fresh, the crust has a nice texture and the pizza is always made to order. For the price, service and quality, it meets all of the criteria. For those that like to take photos for the 'gram', this place has a nice interior for that."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until my cousin introduced it to me and I can say, I am definitely in love with their pizza and their cute restaurant. We ordered: - donnie brasco (Classic Tomato, Shredded House Blend, Ricotta, Fennel Sausage, Chorizo Sausage, Pepperoni, Pickled Red Onions, Fresh Parmesan, Oregano) - into the wild (Fresh Mozzarella, Blue Cheese, Wild Mushroom Blend, Fresh Parmesan, Truffle Oil)  They both tasted amazing but I would recommend eating the donnie brasco first as the flavours aren't as overpowering as the mushroom. I would definitely return to try their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised after my visit here. Service is quite quick and pre-designed combos are creative.   i had the DATE NIGHT, which included barbeque sauce, fennel sausage crumbles, dates, mozza, and and parmesan. crust is thin but \"Q\", a refreshing change from the crisp thin crust everywhere else, and dusted with cornmeal which i typically like. the barbeque sauce/cheese combo killed the roof of my mouth as it was scalding hot, so BEWARE -- don't be a fatty. just give your pizza two seconds to cool off! the addition of dates to pizza was completely new to me and went quite well with all of the other ingredients. at first i felt the sausage bits were a little sparse/too tiny but ultimately i think too much and it would've thrown off the flavour balance. just better distribution and it'd be perfecto.  i was confused reading the menu when i couldn't tell how many ingredients you could add for a design-your-own, but after overhearing other orders i realized it was unlimited! i'll give that a try next time but have a feeling my inner fat kid will overload on the toppings to the point where the crust would buckle at the weight. OH WELL - that's what forks are for right?  wine and beer on tap for those interested. I haven't seen this place during peak hours but the cool decor makes for a nice quiet spot to hang out late in the evening."}
{"text":"Wow! What a cute little pizza place. The food was amazing, and the decor/branding/ambiance was very pretty.  We got the arugula parmegiano pizza (can't remember the name), which had roasted garlic. It was a thin crust but the dough held up very well and did not get soggy. Their oven is not even a brick oven, but the dough got baked properly. I think their oven heats the pizza from the top and bottom, not sure.  It was $14 for a medium which is enough for 1-2 people. It's pricier than your averga pizza but we think it was totally worth it.  Initially we came in because I liked their logo and branding, but to our surprise the pizza was amazing. I was told there's only 2 locations in Toronto. It's not a franchise."}
{"text":"One Pizza is such a simple idea and it works.  You can design your pizza from the bottom up with unlimited toppings for just over $11+ tax. They also have some specialty pizza on the menu for the same price.  An example of my last pizza: whole wheat with pesto sauce and goat cheese topped with chicken, sun dried tomato, spinach, bacon, fennel sausage, pepperoni, sautéed mushroom, extra virgin olive oil, and oregano.... Hungry yet?  The pizza size is enough for one person... If you tend to eat a large pizza in one sitting then you'll need to buy 2 here... If you only usually east a couple slices in one sitting then this will definitely do you over. Pizza is thin crust so it's not hard to eat the whole thing.  For a personal pizza the price is a tad high but it's definitely worth it cause of the unlimited toppings and fresh ingredients. Restaurant has a cool hipster vibe and lofty decor. Also the staff are super friendly so that's the icing on the cake  Gotta check out this place next time you're by King and Jarvis."}
{"text":"Cute little pizza spot - perfect for a date night or catching up with friends and family. Decided to finally give True True a try after passing it every day on my way to work. Definitely exceeded expectations! Personal-sized, thin crust pizzas with a myriad of topping choices. I tried a wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil, subbing blue cheese for cherry tomatoes and was super happy with the size, taste and cost (~$12 for any kind of pizza whether you order a pre-made or customize your own).   Ordering takes place at the counter and when your pizza is ready staff bring it to your table. In addition to yummy eats the decor is also amazing. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Was craving for pizza and wanted to try out this joint as it has been notable for great pizza by quite a few other food bloggers.  This spot lets you customize your own pizza with unlimited toppings and they also have several pre configured pizzas on their menu made fresh to order.   As a first timer, I opt for their pre configured pizza, the Donnie Brasco which was made with classic tomato, shredded house blend, ricotta, fennel sausage, chorizo sausage, pepperoni, pickled red onions, fresh parmesan and oregano.   It was absolutely a mouth watering experience eating this pizza. The crust was crisp on the outside and thin (not too doughy on the inside). All the ingredients married perfectly together and came out fresh tasting and piping hot. It also did not leave you with that greasy oily feeling at all either.  Will definitely be back again. As well, I plan on trying other similar joints (i.e. Blaze Pizza) so that I can draw further comparisons."}
{"text":"When eating at a pizza place, one ought to simply order pizza - lesson learned. I came here while in the midst of my bi-weekly, short-lived salad phase and ordered a salad with a side of salad. Specifically, the Chop Chop and the Side Car. The Chop Chop ($12.29) had chopped romaine, red & white quinoa, red & yellow pepper, avocado, grape, tomatoes, pomegranate seeds, green onion, pea shoots and a cilantro tamarind vinaigrette. The side car, on the other hand, was a simpler blend of arugula, sliced pear, walnuts, goat cheese and lemon dijon vinaigrette. Both were difficult to consume, especially as someone who is not compelled by greens as it is. The side car, however, was the most disappointing - a modicum of goat cheese barely felt fair for a product worth about $8 after-tax ($6.86 pre-).   On another occasion, I had the Aristocrat and the Kale, Caesar! salad. I believe the Aristocrat (tomato, mozzarella, garlic confit, pesto, arugula, extra virgin olive oil and parmesan for $14.86) was the only pizza on the menu that did not have pork, apart from Into the Wild (blue cheese, mushroom, same price). The pizza was just fine but I did wish they had more options for those with dietary restrictions! On a more positive note, I would say that True True's pizzas are far healthier and noticeably less greasy than what you might encounter at a mainstream chain restaurant. My meal felt light, but at the same time I didn't finish feeling completely full. The salad was much better than the others I had before - essentially an earthy mix of kale, parmesan and lemon for $6.86.  Overall, I'd recommend you take the customize-a-pizza option when you dine in if it is still around - that way you can make the most out of True True :)"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place for pizza. The consistency in flavor and always delivering a satisfying experience makes the 5 stars worth it.   The staff is friendly and patient when I choose my toppings.  I've had Blaze Pizza which has more variety but in my opinion True True wins on fresher ingredients.   I've had the frozen yogurt which isn't anything special and probably slightly overpriced, but a great dessert after a delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I was here on day 10 after they opened and service was great. Food was great.   A week later I'm back. And this happened: I asked for no onions. I was the only person in line. Guess what she put on my pizza?! Onions! It's not brain surgery! It's listening skills that are lacking in customer service. Luckily before the pizza went in the onions came off!  I think the restaurant is a great addition to the community. Prices are fair and the food is fresh.   Teach the \"young people\" to listen to the customer's answer after they ask the question.  How could I forget?! The young lady preparing my food (and putting unwanted onions on my pizza) was wearing gloves but then takes a J cloth and wipes the counter. I asked if she was going to change her gloves before handling my food? She said: it's ok we use food safe. I'm presuming that's some sort of cleaning solution?! YA I don't want someone touching chemicals then my food. Really?! From a health & safety perspective and food handler; they don't think that will look strange to a customer?! Dirty cloth, you touching said dirty cloth then handling my food. No thanks! Watch them while they prep your food."}
{"text":"I am really sorry to leave a bad review here because their pizza are good but they are currently, as I speak, making me lose 55$ on a delivery order. I placed it on their website more than 1h30 ago and I still have nothing. I tried to call many times and I sent an email but nothing.  Forget about this place, this will be my last order"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza options with unlimited toppings, very nice ambience .   Used to be called as one pizza ! They have maintained the quality and prices!   Would definitely recommend trying out their different pizzas and you can make them anyway you like!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean place, lots of space, friendly staff and custom made pizza at affordable prices. What else could you wish for?"}
{"text":"We ordered a build your own pizza and a date night pizza (with no dates in it). The pizza comes out in an oval shape instead of circular. I find the tomato sauce to be kind of bland in my customise pizza but I enjoyed the fresh mozzarella. The date night pizza was delicious with the chicken and BBQ sauce.   The price of one pizza was around $14 which was not bad considering it was filling. Good service and lots of seatings available."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I was in a bit of a rush and got their gluten-free margherita pizza to go. Everything is made fresh in front of you but once you order you're asked to walk down to the cashier to pay and wait. Unfortunately this means that you don't actually get to see them make the pizza in front of you unless you linger around, and trust me, they were in no hurry so that would have been awkward. I didn't get to see if they prevented cross contamination by 1) changing their plastic gloves, 2) using different utensils to prepare the food, or 3) use a different cooking oven (which is a conveyor belt through an oven, like how they toast bagels at Timmies). They did however take longer to make my pizza than other people's, so possibly they were being more cautious and I just didn't see it. I had two parties after me get served their pizza before I got mine.   The pizza itself was good, but for my taste could use more sauce since it was a bit watery. I didn't have any reactions to it and the portion size was generous for a personal pizza. The takeout box is a bit awkwardly shaped though and they don't give you a travel bag so you're basically holding the box that has an angled lid, which isn't that great in the winter when you already have to deal with icy sidewalks.   TL;DR decent pizza, possibility for cross contamination, awkward takeout box"}
{"text":"One of the newest chic restaurant in downtown Toronto. I took my wife to this place for her birthday. The manager and the staff were very friendly and accommodating with our needs. The pizza is great, they have a great choice of pizzas. The Aloha Smoke is very good and would order this pizza again!"}
{"text":"Awesome build your-own-pizzas  Food: 4/5 Make your own with unlimited toppings (only prosciutto is extra $2.50). I like their preset pizzas too. My fav is \"into the wild\" with mushrooms and truffle oil. Pizzas are all made to order. Good beer selection - craft beer is always appreciated.  Atmosphere: 4/5 Nice retro chic renovations. Located in the downtown core. Service: 4/5 helpful and friendly staff. You order and they bring your pizza to you. Self serve water"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are visiting from Los Angeles and we both love One Pizza We really wish that it was in LA. I honestly think this is the exactly the way pizza should be. Not greasy, not super fatty, not having all these artificial ingredients, but fresh, simple, quality, ingredients. I'm full, but want to go back for seconds LOL. I can tell why has such rave reviews on yelp I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Best in the downtown area. Great customer device. Clean store. My husband and I are huge fans. We planned on going back for the last night of our trip and overslept. We were very sad. I had the Donny Brasco and he creates his own cheese pizza. Both were exceptional."}
{"text":"We chose this place because it could seat our group of 5 and feed those that were vegetarian and one that kept kosher. Everyone in our group was happy with their food. The problem was you had to order at the counter and a lot of online orders came between part of our group which cut down on the time we had to visit. Also I can only stand for a limited time and with the delay I had to find a place to sit while I waited for my food."}
{"text":"My husband I really enjoyed the pizzas. I had the aristocrat and he had the create your own pizza. He made his pizza half and half and they were really patient with him as he was putting different toppings on each half. Btw, bechamel sauce was delicious! We just wish though that the crust was a bit thinner at the ends. Manager on duty was friendly and outgoing. It's always nice to see the manager on the floor working and greeting customers. We would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"TrueTrue, previously called One Pizza, offers a simple selection of signature pizzas or you can create-your-own pizza. Both options cost the same, $11.86 each. I came here a bit after lunch hour with a friend, so they were not very busy at all. I opted for their Hunt & Peck, which is topped with spicy tomato, fresh mozzarella, spinach, chorizo sausage, farm eggs, parmesan, chili oil, and black pepper. My friend had the Aristocrat, topped with classic tomato, mozzarella, garlic confit, pesto, arugula, extra virgin olive oil, and parmesan.  Although their pizzas looked amazing, both my friend and I agreed that their pizzas were very underwhelming and bland. The first bit was good, but slowly lost that \"wow\" factor. They even forgot to cut my pizza into individual slices when I was served my pizza. The Hunt & Peck lacked any real flavour except for the heat coming through from the chili oil and chorizo sausage. It felt like they did not season this pizza at all. On the other hand, the Aristocrat was quite salty. Maybe they accidentally put all the salt into one of our order? Who knows lol. Definitely had have better pizza than this before. Might I dare say, even Domino's pizza is better than this. Won't be coming back any time soon unfortunately."}
{"text":"We are relatively new to our neighbourhood.  We have not found good pizza until tonight.  The pizza we ordered was in our top three pizzas of our lives.  We did a build your own, and it had arugula on top.    Thanks.  We'll be back often."}
{"text":"I ordered this from uber eats- ate the whole aristocrat pizza, and a kale Cesar salad that I was nervous about, but thoroughly enjoyed as well. So much so, I had to come on here and say thank you very much, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good, quick wood oven (I think) pizza. Any way it's quick, if there's no line. Chances are if you go at lunch, there's a long line.   It's very tasty, especially for the whole wheat option I got.   I didn't give it 5 stars bc I think it is kinda pricey.   Also, there was this blonde woman that gave the dirtiest look to her fellow employees for making a pizza too big? What's up with that? Shouldn't be done in front of customers. Other than that everyone else seemed very friendly."}
{"text":"Came by on a Friday night with my sister in law to catch up and enjoy some delicious fresh pizza. The service was great, the pizza delicious, the ingredients fresh, and the ambience ideal. It wasn't too crowded that night meaning we could very easily catch up. As for the pizza, it was absolutely delicious. Being fresh made in front of you is great too, especially if you like to call the shots. Me, I opted for the \"Donnie Brasco\" since it sounded absolutely delicious (and it was).  The price was also quite reasonable. No, this is not as cheap as your slice from Pizza Pizza but you're getting what you pay for. If you are in the mood for something fresh, tasty, and a little bit different be sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend the personal size margherita! It is the perfect bite if you want something filling on your lunch break without feeling stuffed and heavy afterwards.  The process of ordering is fast and easy and you can choose to eat in or take it to go (if you are in a rush you can also call ahead or use their App to have it delivered).  The place is clean and cozy and you can also indulge in some wine ( or beer) or a frozen yogurt afterwards.  If you fill you need some more, then you can just order the extra large or have a small for a very quick and small appetite.  Also, they offer free wi-fi and lemon infused water :) A nice touch!  Recommend this place to everybody. As all my colleagues come here too for lunch almost everyday.  Oh, and they offer salads as well!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to build your own pizza (back from when they were called OnePizza). The staff were friendly and generous with the toppings at a great price point. I went back recently and saw the prices have significantly increased and instead of having one standard size, the portions have changed.  I guess there was an adjustment of business model. The quality is still good but won't be going as frequently."}
{"text":"It's true, the pizza here is solid. Similar to most other fast casual, build your own pizza places, but they offer a lot more unique offerings than the standard pizza place. Want a fresh cracked egg on your pizza? You can get that here. I got the aloha smoke, which is an elevated version of the standard Hawaiian pizza. It's got two of the most controversial toppings - pineapple and cilantro, which I typically enjoy, but it just didn't work for me on this pizza. I tried my friend's \"The Pro\" pizza which I liked a lot more.   They have bottles of what I thought was chili oil, but it tasted like nothing, so I'd avoid all those empty calories because it ain't gonna do anything for the already delicious pizza."}
{"text":"My friend and I were so happy to stumble upon this gem last night when we were craving for a good pizza after some drinks! They have a set pizza menu but you can basically make your own  with a whole range of gourmet toppings. You can even choose your dough! I was super pleased and satisfied and can't wait to go back for my next pizza fix!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon and it was quite empty, which is good because I wanted to get some work done on my laptop without getting into anyone's way. They have free wifi and I sat by the table against the window, giving me coffee shop vibes even though I was there for an actual meal. Ordered a salad and their chocolate chip cookie. Salad ingredients were fresh and I was told the cookie was fresh out of the oven. Both were delicious. I would like to come back in the future for their made to order pizzas."}
{"text":"You know this place is good when the orders and lines are backed up. I like that the app allows easy customization. although I thought that it was unlimited toppings since they're \"not like the others\" but hey, each bite was full of toppings so I can't complain much.   it would be fun if they add in seasonal ingredients as well."}
{"text":"Was in the area for an event a couple of weeks ago. En route home, we were still hungry so dropped in One Pizza for a second dinner. For a quick and simple dinner, One Pizza is a great choice. You can order any of their pizzas on their menu; should you not fancy any on the list, you can also 'Create Your Own.' There are a lot of places to sit so you can either dine in or dine out. They have a liqueur licence so you can grab a glass of wine or a pint of beer here.   I can't wait to return and try another 'Create [My] Own' pizza!  Good for: pizza, fast food"}
{"text":"Finally a pizza I love! If you are going to have pizza, have it the real way. Don't get glutin free crust, don't get whole wheat. Get the regular crust and you won't be disappointment. I love the aristocrat with some extra brocollini."}
{"text":"Interesting concept - one size one price any toppings.  The topping selection is great.  They sold me on the pizza that has eggs but I didn't really like it all that much.  I like eggs just fine but I didn't think it really went that well on pizza - maybe after a night of drinking... The crust is a bit on the hard side for thin crust and it has that cornmeal on the bottom which I find distracting.  If I choose the right ingredients maybe I could boost rating to a 4 star but the cornmeal and crust quality is the limiting factor.  They have really great cookies from a bakery and service is friendly.  Pizzas are fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Try the donnie brasco with spicey sauce.  And the big chocolate cookie for dessert.  Great environment, super friendly staff.  Will go again before I head back to the states."}
{"text":"Love it here! The pizza was sooo good and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the pizzas. I love the fact that you can customize the pizzas as well!"}
{"text":"I dislike soggy pizzas. This place doesn't serve soggy pizzas! Great food, great service, and comfortable and relaxing environment."}
{"text":"I dig this place. Needed a quality 'za and got one here.  The pizza won't blow you away but it's customizable and tasty. Nice that they have beer and wine available. Tasty side salad too.  I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with gourmet toppings; this is where I come to when I want to treat myself to a premium pizza. I definitely recommend the Aloha Smoke if you're a fan of pineapple on pizza."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here on our break between classes as it is across the street from our school. Our classmates always bring their boxes to class, so we had to come once! I got the \"Into the Wild\" pizza because I love mushrooms and blue cheese (but actually, any cheese). It delicious, but it was even better after drizzling the chili oil on. The manager/owner was extremely friendly and seemed to be very involved in all operations of the business. They also have complimentary water you can fill yourself. The prices are comparable to pizza prices you order at a restaurant. I'll be back again, but to make my own customized pizza. That seems to be a better value unless you really want something specific from the specialty pizzas.  Come get a pizza dat! You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is one of those instagram-worthy restaurants that also packs flavour with fresh/good quality ingredients! I'm surprised it's not as hyped as it should be. My Saturday dinner was very pleasant. There's more ubereats and foodora mens in here than actual diners.   Did I mention they also serve draft beer? Pizza+draft beer. Say no more fam. Just go here. There are so many pizza options baked to perfection AND you can also custom make your own masterpiece. Must go."}
{"text":"Solid three stars for this quick and pleasant pizza joint. Came here on a Friday and got the Aristocrat pizza. 10-15 minutes later it was delivered to my table on a plastic tray sans utensils. That was A-Ok as it was easy to handle and it went with the whole relaxed and easy vibe.  I also ordered the 9oz Cab Sauv from Chile which went pretty well with the flavours of the pizza. I wouldn't say this will be my favourite new pizza place in the city but it's a reasonable choice in this area and the prices are in proportion to the serving size and quality."}
{"text":"I love this place - it's some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. Their salads are also really delicious. And the pink interior is really nice!"}
{"text":"I've had this pizza twice; once was dine in and once was delivery.   The time I dined in was great, delicious pizza with quality toppings.  The wait time was also very reasonable.  The price is a little on the high side for the size of the pizzas.  Though worth a try.   The time I had it delivered was horrible.  Twenty minutes after the deliver time, there was no pizza.  I called the place and they told me it wasn't delivered because there was a glitch in their system which didn't allow them to see if the order was pick up or delivery.   I understand that it's not their fault there's glitch, though it's their responsibility to find out if it's delivery or pick up, not the customers (especially since there's a $5 charge for deliver).  They apologize for the mix up and ask me for my address again and send out the driver.  When the driver gets here, he makes me come down to his car to get my pizzas.  By the time I get to the table, the pizzas were rock hard and ice cold.   It was disappointing since I kept telling my friends how great it was going to be based on my previous experience with the place."}
{"text":"I ate here twice when it was called One Pizza, it was amazing. I'm sure the pizza is still great. But, Yelp shows that the restaurant is open until 11 PM. I walked there with a friend a few minutes ago because I didn't want to order Dominoes or other garbage. It was closed when we got there at 10:30 PM. The owner should contact Yelp to correct this. Still, very inconvenient hours."}
{"text":"I got the Large Hunt & Peck. The large was good for two people, but if you tend to eat more than the usual, then you probably would be putting on $21 per pizza. The pizza shape was also pretty interesting, since it's in a rectangular shape.  The portion sizes are fairly good, but it's a tad pricier than Blaze, but it's tastier and better ingredients. Service was good and they were patient with our order. I'd go for the build your own next time because I was under the impression that the individual ingredients cost more in the store, but online it basically reads like the system is only for the premium ingredients (of which there weren't too many). The inside reminded me of those 60s diners without all the plush seating and you had to serve your own water. That water dispenser worked, but it felt like it barely worked. Also, it'd be a nice touch to add a bit of lemon/citrus fruits etc to the water. Up to them, but I think that's an instant plus and also very good.  This place is an order at the back and they'll bring you your food. There were not many diners, which was surprising because I feel like it should have at least more business. There were more orders for take out via UberEats than actual dine-in's so it is probably the location which isn't as prime. This place is good for a casual date night especially because it was pretty private, there's a beautiful garden nearby and you can at least drink alcohol if things aren't going too well.   I liked the fact that they had a pizza with an egg on top, which was an instant plus because it's hard to find one that would have it on the menu.   Service: 4.0 / 5 Food: 5 / 5 Price Point: 4.0 / 5  Overall: 4.5 / 5"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Really cool concept. The price is right as well. Fresh ingredients, lots of toppings to choose from, no limit on toppings, dough rolled in front of you - great idea. Good service. A casual and different choice for the area - well done."}
{"text":"As a pizza super fan, naturally, I had to try this (fairly) new spot in Corktown.  I went with a group of friends on a Friday evening.  We were a little concerned that we wouldn't be able to get a table (there were 7 of us), but when we arrived around 6:30pm, most of the tables were open.    Their menu has 7 pizzas to choose from, and they are all the same price ($11.86).  For the same cost, though, you can create your own pizza with unlimited toppings (which is what I chose to do).  Rather than ordering at the table, you place your order and a pizza station and the employees prep the pizza in front of you (think Subway, but with pizza).  There is a great selection of toppings to choose from - it was hard to narrow down exactly what I wanted!  I ended up ordering a pizza on traditional crust (you can also choose from whole wheat or gluten-free (add $2.50)) with both classic tomato and pesto sauces.  I chose to add fresh mozzarella, artichoke hearts, caramelized onion, cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives and salami (on half).  After the pizza was done cooking, I topped it with a  balsamic glaze.  The pizza was delicious!  It had a nice variety of flavours - sweet tomato sauce, salty toppings, and a little punch from the balsamic glaze.  The crust was thin (which I love!) but a little too soft.  I think a crispier crust would make this pizza taste even better (and would have held up to the toppings better, as well).    Overall, a delicious pizza that is quick and convenient!  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"You get the same quality pizza you would at places like Pizzeria Libretto and Lady Margareta (don't get me wrong, I love these places) but for so much less.   One pizza generally costs $12 or you can make your own combination (unlimited toppings!!!!!) for $12 too.   Me and my boyfriend got the spicy sausage pizza with two runny eggs."}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars. I've had two terrible experiences. The first bad experience was when a large order ahead of me was missing a pizza order and so they gave the large group my pizza. Which meant I had to wait for a new pizza to be made for my order. I complained and got a coupon for my next pizza. This second time, a large group was before and after me, and somehow my order was pulled out of the queue and behind both orders. I walked out because I wasnt going to wait for 5 pizzas to get baked before mine. This place is not worth the effort."}
{"text":"Went to this spot a few times when it was One Pizza, so was a little concerned that they rebranded so quickly. Thankfully the quality of the pizza is exactly the same, and they've added some bells and whistles to sweeten the deal.  Their pizza is quite delicious. At first it feels weird eating an entire pizza by yourself (like me) but the crust is thin and you don't feel like garbage when you're done -- sometimes you want more. I usually stick with the Donnie Brasco (which is also a great movie) but I've also had the Aloha Smoke and Into The Wild -- yet I keep coming back for Donnie. You can easily create your own as well.  I actually stopped coming here for quite some time because I was trying to cool it with pizza in my diet, but I was intrigued by their sandwich board promoting salads. The Chop Chop is quite tasty, and the Side Car is also a good choice if you're looking for just a side with your 'za.  They have a few beers on tap which is great if you want to kick back with some suds while you wait for your food to bake, though it usually only takes 10 minutes.  I've been totally satisfied with the food every time I've come here, so whenever I'm in the mood for pizza this has become my go-to in the Market."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that TrueTrue has the best pizza in Toronto. Also one of the best ambiences. The place has such pretty colours and a comfy ambience. I'm obsessed with their instagram worthy environment! I love that basically all the toppings are free, that way you don't have to settle for just a few toppings. My only complaint is that the serving of the pizza isn't that big. It's satisfying, but certainly not a lot if you eat a lot. I will certainly come here again!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Toronto. Friendly staff.. Fresh ingredients, make your own pizza as well as set pizzas on the menu.. Beer and wine on tap and great decor."}
{"text":"This is probably my only pizza place I go to around this area. Is quick, convenient and their pizza taste fantastic. You choose your ingredients and size, pay and just wait for them to bring it right to your table if you are dining in. This is what make this place nice as a fast food, you don't have to hang around to wait for your order to be ready and then go find a table, but it will come to you! Everyone working there is always nice and welcoming and I also like their wine and beer selection. The only thing is that they might be a little busy over lunch and they close at 10pm which would be nice if they stay open late on the weekend for an \"after-hour\" snack. You can also call ahead to have your pizza ready for when you arrive if you are starving and don't have much time to waste. Recommended."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday before normal dinner time. They were really quick. Wife and I loved our pizzas. The personal really can feed two if your appetite is light. Small is really meant for one."}
{"text":"If you want a Truetrue Pizza experience, look no further. Truetrue is a pizza place on King Street East that you can choose from a selection of choices of pizzas or you can make your own creation. Only thing is that you are not actually doing the kneading or putting on your own toppings. You just have the options while the pizza chefs place your toppings on for you. I started off with spicy tomato sauce with a drizzle of pesto, then I proceeded to the cheeses. I got mozzarella, bocconcini, goat cheese, and feta cheese (stayed away from the blue cheese as it has a strong overpowering taste). On to the MEAT!! Since I am pretty much a carnivore, I chose all of the meats. (Pepperoni, chorizo, chicken, beef, salami, and BACON (MORE BACON!!). As for the vegetables, I chose mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and spinach. All topped off with 2 eggs. If you are wondering if I finished it? Well those who know me, know that its bulking season. But in all seriousness the custom pizza is a great portioned sized personal pizza with many selections of topping to choose from. Not to mention they have wine and craft beer in tall cans or on tap. I would suggest coming here for a date night, with friends, or even bring the family. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"favourite pizza place! been coming here since it was still One Pizza, soooo good, neighbourhood fave by far. love their super thin, super crispy crust and their spicy tomato base is sweet with a kick. love adding the egg to my usual Hunt And Peck. I usually pair it with a cherry boylans at checkout. tip: their chocolate chip cookies are soft gooey and delicious too. takeout is a breeze with their skinny boxes!"}
{"text":"Great service! Came here for lunch with a friend and the ordering process was a breeze. The pizza is pricier than your average lunch spot (around 15 sans drink) but it's very delicious.   It's awesome they have gluten free dough too! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great and quick pizza! Light thin crust. Great toppings including confit and caramelized onions."}
{"text":"Took the Friday before Labour Day off and treated myself to some pizza and vino for lunch. I ordered the Donnie Brasco which was a meat lovers dream. The toppings were fresh and the dough was delicious. I'd say this is a middle ground between the Libretto/QMP-style and your typical mom and pop pizza joint. And the price point was great. I could definitely have split my meal.   Next time I go back, I'll be sure to make my own instead of going with a signature pizza."}
{"text":"This place was one of those make your own pizza places. The whole process from ordering, choosing toppings, and receiving the baked end result was quite a breeze. I loved that they had eggs as one of their topping options.  Taste is quite good for my palette, though I kinda wished that the crust was a bit crispier and had more charcoal texture. Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite of good pizza!"}
{"text":"For it's price of 12 dollars it's amazing! You can pick as many toppings as you want, and be as creative as you want! There was plenty of seating area available as well!"}
{"text":"OnePizza should stick around. Please don't be cursed and share the same fate as Ole Ole.  Everyone should try this place.   I'll start with the bad,  since there isn't a lot. I'm not a fan of the price - $12 for one pizza which doesn't include any drink. Yes,  unlimited toppings but once could fill up on a whole medium pizza from Pizza Pizza for $5. Let's not argue about quality but just an example of the mark up here.   The good: the pizza! Really fresh dough and you get to choose between white,  whole wheat and gluten free,  extra charge though.   Pick and chose any and every ingredient you wish. It amazes how quickly the pizza cooks which perfect dough bubbles in such little time. I also like the extra finishing toppings like chili oil,  truffle oil,  arugula,  capers,  chili flakes, etc.   There's wine and beer on tap. And the sea salt and chocolate chip cookies aren't so bad either. I should also mention that the staff is super friendly and welcoming.    I'll probably come back,  but it just pains me to pay so much for so little."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is fantastic.  Grabbed a takeout pizza (built my own:  bechamel, cheese blend, pepperoni, chorizo, bacon, mushrooms and carmelized onions.) Pretty good combo and all of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  Will definitely return, what a great addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"I came back Friday night for a quick pizza dinner. Prices have since gone up a bit now $12.95 + tax to build your own pizza with unlimited toppings. They continue to have a good selection of toppings but I'm not sure why they got rid of the mini menu list with toppings. I constantly had to ask what was what and what kind of cheese they had etc. I wanted feta cheese on my pizza but I end up getting goat cheese. Guess the girl made an error but I typically don't like goat cheese - at all. I got some simple toppings along with some really good ones like chorizo, asparagus, roasted red peppers etc.   I came here when they were called One Pizza. They've changed the layout of the restaurant as well. To be honest it makes the restaurant a little brighter but I preferred the old layout and old menu style. The food is still good, with a few alcoholic beverages on tap. I would recommend if anyone wants a good pizza with unique toppings."}
{"text":"I still remember the first time I had one of True True's pies was not at the shop, but at the stand during the summer at Union Station. I walked right past all the eager customers waiting for the gram worthy chimney cone to get myself a personal Donnie Brasco. It was a sight to behold. The bubbled crust, the sausage and chorizo, the onions and cheese. It felt like a delightful modern twist on the Neapolitan/Margherita classic form. It called for me and I answered. I devoured it before heading towards Jack Layton's for some epic Pokemon Go with my friends.   Fast forward a bit and there I was with the Hunt and Peck. It very strongly reminds me of a breakfast version of a pizza. It was, as expected, delicious. The chew of the crust, the satisfaction of the yolk, cheese and sausage in my mouth with moments of chili and black pepper. What a great pizza. It's unfortunate I don't really frequent this area, 'cause I'd love to be back for their rendition of the Hawaiian, the Aloha Smoke. For sure worth a try!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza experience. Quick. Lots of toppings options. Tasty crust.  The dough is soft and chewy, and freshly made in house. The toppings are numerous and plentiful and it's ONE price for as many toppings as you want. Though I'd say a few of their signature pizzas are worth trying. I enjoyed the Donnie Brasco, Hunt & Peck, and Paris of the South. The Aloha Smoke was a bit lacking... It wasn't bad at all, but a lot more generic than the others I've tried. I was expecting more from the pineapple salsa which was really just chopped pineapple small. If you are going to order that one I'd recommend adding a few more ingredients to make it a bit more special. I'd also recommend adding at least some kind of stronger cheese like parmesan, blue cheese, or feta to make sure you get slapped in the face with some cheese.  If you are looking for a cheap pizza slice, it's probably not the place for you. But if you are looking for a sizeable single pizza you can eat all yourself and not feel ashamed then this is the place! Also, you could potentially share it with someone... if you both aren't really hungry."}
{"text":"I ordered a large swirl soft serve gelato ice cream from True True. It was $6 plus tax. It's also an extra 75 cents if you want toppings. I got the strawberry sauce, skor bits and rainbow chocolates as my toppings. I found the dessert to be on the pricey side for mediocre ice cream. It didn't taste like gelato at all. It tasted more like regular ice cream truck soft serve ice cream. The staff at the restaurant was also not very friendly. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"First, lets start with the ambience and environment. Absolutely amazing! I love the decoration, the place its just so cute and amazing vibed. I love this kind of relaxed environment.   The food itself is really good, we had two pizzas and both were true to taste. They also put enough toppings on it that you have it in every single bite. The crust is a little chewy - if you're into chewy pizza. I also really like that its personalized sizes but at the same time very shareable."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the feel of the whole place. I had the Aloha Smoke it was great. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"This place and blaze pizza are very comparable. I think true true though has the edge when it comes to everything except location. The quality of ingredients are definitely better, nicer decorated restaurant, wider range of options etc. it's $14 for a personal pizza which is enough for 1 person. That is more expensive but I think it's worth it. Me and my friends each got one of the seasonal pizzas which were all excellent. My personal favorite of the seasonal pizzas was the devil in disguise (i think it was chorizo, honey, sesame crust, peppers and some other ingredients I don't remember)."}
{"text":"Great pizza with thin crust. I like all the unique topping combinations. If you are eating it as a meal, skip the first size, unless you want a light snack."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least five times since it opened and I have been happy with the food. I always do the build your own pizza which has unlimited toppings. The BYO pizza comes out around 13 and is enough to feed one hungry me. You can choose between whole wheat and white dough, several bases and a couple types of cheese and plenty if meat and veggie toppings so you should be able to find what you like. Opens relatively late for a comfort food place on King east, which is another plus. I think one pizza has found a pretty sweet spot between convenience and the qualify of food and the value for the money."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch here. The pizza was cooked to perfection with fresh toppings. Staff were friendly and efficient. Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like the layout of the restaurant, it gives off a unique and modern vibe. The staff was very welcoming and helpful as they guided me through the ordering process. This was my first time being able to select an unlimited amount of toppings for an affordable price of only $11 (obviously I went trigger happy). The aroma from the pizza made my stomach growl. Opening the pizza box was like opening a treasure chest. I was excited to say the least! The pizza was oven baked to perfection. I love the crispiness of the thin crust and the flavors from my choice of ingredients. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5  Would come back? Yes  My favourite customize-your-own pizza spot. I've tried all of their signature pizzas, but I'll highlight my two favourites below that I always come back for:  1. Hunt & Peck - The famous \"egg\" pizza with spicy tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, spinach, chorizo sausage, farm eggs, fresh parmesan, chili oil and cracked black pepper. This one is delicious - eggs and chorizo on pizza is a pretty weird/unconventional combination if you think about it, but the spices really make the pizza.   2. Aloha Smoke - A Hawaiian-style pizza with classic tomato sauce, shredded house blend cheese, smoked bacon, pineapple salsa, cilantro and crushed chilies. I love this one because the pineapple pieces are plentiful but chopped up in fine cubes, and the bacon is not too salty."}
{"text":"Although the pizza is pretty damn good, do not order via UberEATS. The couriers are unable to package the delivery. You will receive a sloppy pizza with toppings stuck to the box and slices folded in half. UberEATS is such a bush league operation."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Their pizzas are super tasty and I love how thin crust they are. I got the 'Into the Wild' Pizza which had Fresh Mozzarella, Blue Cheese, Wild Mushroom Blend, Fresh Parmesan, Truffle Oil. I got a half pizza and a small salad (can't remember which one) , and I must say it was super enjoyable the whole way through.   10/10 waiting to come back to have more pizza. Great for a casual lunch time spot with coworkers or friends! Wish they had a patio and they definitely need another more central location."}
{"text":"This restaurant wins it's five star because of the sheer volume of choices. There are certain pre-made pizza combinations available, but the create your own pizzas were where One Pizza shined. The taste complemented this as well, as it was comparable in quality to higher end sit down Italian restaurants. Even better, the pizza is cooked fresh before your eyes. Only drawback is the price, which was about $12 per pizza. However, it is clear you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint that rivals Blaze Pizza for a build-you-own option. The different sizes are great and the toppings are fresh and delicious. I went for an all meat + pineapple + mushroom option and it did not disappoint. They don't have signs on their toppings and some were \"premium\" toppings so it can be a bit daunting to order if you don't know exactly what you want or what a topping is. The crust was crispy and light and the tomato sauce was good, but not as good as Blaze in my opinion. It seems that they are expanding with another location on Queen and if they manage to keep the same quality, they're sure to be successful! Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week, as it was near our hotel.  There were four of us, and we each got a 'personal' sized pizza.  They were easily big enough to share, and we all ended up taking half back to the hotel.  I had the Aristocrat, which I liked, but the arugula was a bit much.  My husband had the Date Night, and it was really, really good.  Also highly recommended is the Aloha Smoke, though my daughter ordered it without the crushed chilies.  It was pricey, but then we did order twice as much food as we needed.  Two big thumbs up."}
{"text":"A nicely decorated restaurant with a different ordering style than the normal sit at your seat and order off the menu. You order and and pay at the counter and then grab your seat and the restaurant staff will bring your pizza. I got the Margarita Pizza and it was delicious and light, I would definitely order it again. My fiancé got the Donnie Brasco pizza I think and it was also delicious but slightly heavier compared to the Margarita pizza because it contained the sausages and the pepperoni. I would definitely come back here again if I'm in the area. Top notch pizza. Stay tuned for soft serve Gelato during the warmer months."}
{"text":"They changed a lot of things that I was really excited about. I ordered my own creation to go and I was wondering why they never asked to top up my pizza so I didn't get any arugula, truffle oil or Parmesan. The japlenos is now a saucy type, they didn't have a white base so I was left with tomato sauce or pesto. The number of toppings decreased. I didn't see as many vegetables.   The server was nice but definitely gave vibes of attitude if you don't get them on a good day. He checked me out and didn't mention the app they were heavily promoting.   I picked up this pizza to try and as an app for my actual dinner but I don't even know if it will suffice. Definitely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice little place on King East.  This place makes those gourmet flatbread pizzas. I ordered a marguerita pizza, which was decent but a tad bland. (I should've asked for chili flakes.) The crust was super thin and soft. And it's the perfect size for one person.  They carry several of my favorite non-alcoholic drinks: GoodDrink brand iced tea, the entire line of Boylan brand pop, and San Benedetto water.  Their playlist was music from the 60's - a nice change."}
{"text":"So yum!!   They have amazing combinations for pizza toppings, I had the Hawaiian smoke and it was delicious. Even the pineapple was fresh! Get the half and half, you get a personal sized pizza and a salad. 10/10 would go back."}
{"text":"Went with a couple of friends after volunteering at the waterfront marathon on Sunday. I really liked the decoration of the place and the overall concept, it's like a fast casual pizza place.  Pizzas look really cool in a rectangular shape, and you can order from the menu or create your own. Plus they have some interesting, not your typical toppings.  We had The Pro and Aloha Smoke. Delicious! Their dough is really really good. It's thin but the corners bake puffy and soft.  Your order the pizza, you pay and have a seat. Soft drinks are self-service but we got the pizza brought to our table. Service is quick."}
