{"text":"Well, if you think that what is on the plate is pizza then you are mistaken, it is called Arizona Cheese Crisp - must be to avoid litigation by the Italians! The exact name of the dish is fig and prosciutto cheese crisp with Humboldt Fog goat cheese (never knew that the great German explorer in his free time was making goat cheese in the fog) and balsamic tomato jus etc. Sounds attractive, even though it is 37C and UV index is 9, time to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We were in town for a couple nights and wandered past the open garage doors and just had to go in. The ambiance was high end with the vibe of a place that's been in town for decades. Killer cocktails and apps and the staff was super friendly. Do yourself a favor and order the Sonoran Burger, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick snack and a drink before a concert and realized it is a Great new addition to downtown Phoenix. Modern twist on southwest cuisine. The avocado fries were amazing and I was impressed with the cocktail menu. Cool vibe."}
{"text":"I'm sure I ordered the wrong things.  We wanted a late night snack, so decided to order the pork wings and the carnitas nachos.   The nachos lacked flavor, the cheese was at the bottom not on top of the nachos and had no flavor.  The carnitas were dry with a smoky flavor.   The pork wings were ok I wouldn't order them again. The pork flavor is really heavy.  The restaurant was beautifully decorated, and some of their entrees looked promising.  However, I only ordered off the appetizer menu.  The staff was extremely friendly and the service was great.   60/100"}
{"text":"A very creative menu of spicy dishes inspired by the southwest. The Toasted Quinoa Bowl was just excellent, and Mary's  Chicken Taquitos makes for a perfect appetizer. Their cocktail menu is quite intriguing, but I focused on their very good selection of local Arizona craft beers on draft. Beyond the food, the interior was well designed; relaxed, not too noisy, and well-detailed with nice materials. And the staff was helpful and attentive, and though my server switched out partway through my meal, there were no interruptions."}
{"text":"This is not a place for lunch, come here if you have a couple hours. I don't understand why they don't hire more servers during lunch. This is the 2nd time we are here and it's 45 mins still no food. BTW when it comes the food is good."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, a good amount are local. Unique yet tasty cocktail options. Decor is really nice and the staff are even nicer! I had the bacon wrapped dates, avocado fries, and a cheese crisp. Everything was fantastic and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Our food was so great, and the service was wonderful. The creamed elote is phenomenal! Out server paid a lot of attentu9n to our many food allergies and was happy to accommodate us when my friend's meal came out wrong. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. Best lunch we've had downtown. My husband says burger was best he's had in Phoenix in years. Don't miss the avocado fries!! Cool vibe and decor"}
{"text":"I come here anytime I fly into Phoenix! I have gone to a lot of restaurants here and can tell you I have yet to receive service at the caliber of this place. The waiting staff is quick and communicates well. I love all the bartenders here. They're super down to earth and have a wealth of knowledge about everything they serve you. Great place for a date. If you're looking for a mind blowing taste bud explosion; see Nicole!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Great service and good selection of food. The crispy pizza was perfectly cheesy and salty. I also tried the Senora Burger and is was great.  Good bun, large slice of raw onion, thick burger, and a friend egg cooked just right.  I will definitely be back to enjoy this again."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Dust Cutter located in the Renaissance hotel in Downtown Phoenix. Now it's important to note that I don't write a lot of reviews, but my experience was so pleasant that I feel I owe it to the service and the restaurant to do so.  I sat down at the bar looking to get some convenient food since I was staying in the hotel anyway.  Christine, the bartender/server, greeted me with a smile and a glass of water.  I ordered the Calamity Jane per her suggestion which was AMAZING.  Since she was 1 for 1 I figured I'd just take her suggestion with the food to which she suggested the Sonorah Burger.  This was a weird one because it came with an egg which I've never tried before, but it was incredible. Perfectly cooked and went well with my cocktail.  

Although the food and the convenience was a significant part of this great experience, Christine was definitely the core of that experience.  She was not only polite which you expect everyone to be, but as a bartender she was very intelligent and intuitive on her suggestion based on other drinks I like.  The whole experience was terrific and I would recommend anyone who is visiting Phoenix to try this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent environment and service. Had three young children with me and waitress went out of her way to make sure they were taken care of and happy. Food was fresh and good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in downtown Phoenix! I discovered when I was staying at the Marriott but I have been back multiple times. Their appetizers are soooo good! I love the blue corn nachos! The environment is really cool as well with an industrial rustic vibe in a fun location downtown. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Avocado fries and pork wings were the bomb! Amazing cocktail menu. Loved the open air concept, service so attentive, ask for Jose. Hotel newly renovated, lobby is gorgeous."}
{"text":"I had lunch in Dust Cutter today and my whole table was beyond impressed.  The avocado fries and the chicken taquitos are a must as appetizers.  I had the fish tacos and they were full of flavor.  The people with me had a quinoa bowl and a salad.  Both were full of flavor.  You need to visit with Rhonda at the bar she has been with the hotel for 41 years and has the best stories!"}
{"text":"The happy hour \"house cocktails\" by the way are not the list of cocktails they have in their bar menu. Instead, what they really meant to say is \"well\" drinks are on happy hour. 

I don't know about others but that seemed misleading,  in my opinion. Oh well. 

As for the staff... of the two bartenders that were there, one was friendly and helpful. The other did her job,  but there was nothing special or endearing about her that one could connect with and think \"Can't wait to come back!\" Nope. Quite the opposite, frankly.  Tried to order \"chicken taquitos\" and was simply told they were out.  No follow up suggestions or nada. Which is fine, I suppose, but as our time there progressed it became evident that she is just not the \"serve others\" kind of bartender. Or maybe, it was just us she didn't care for. Her loss. The restaurant's loss, and a loss to the other bartender. 

I would suggest people go to Blue Hound, instead. It's only a block away and the staff is always friendly and eager to serve. Or the Aroggant Butcher. It's within the same proximity."}
{"text":"My gf and I have been wanting to try this place out for a while. Boy was that a big mistake! we sat at the bar - restaurant wasn't busy at all! The bartender we had was extremely RUDE and disregarding towards us.  A very nasty attitude. Makes sense why the bar was empty...made us feel as if we dnt belong there. When we asked for the bill she stood there  and asked how we will be paying for this with a very nasty look on her face! We left after paying of course. On our way out an employee ran after us asking if we would like to speak to a manager as she noticed how rudely  we were being treated. We said no thanks and walked off. Left feeling DISGUSTED by the way this older lady treated us.  Shame on dust cutter for having a employee like her to represent your restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dust Cutter about 5-6 times now. As far as food, everything I've tried is great.  I would HIGHLY recommend the chorizo flatbread and the burrito bowl with steak. The nachos are also fantastic as an appetizer. All I have tried drink-wise is the wine on tap, but it was fine. Also, the happy hour prices seriously can't be beat.  The only reason I'm giving this place 4 starts is because the service is SO slow. It always takes half an hour for food to come out even if no one else is in the entire restaurant. What gives?  Anyways, if you have the time for a long lunch or dinner, give this place a try. Atmosphere is great too!"}
{"text":"Loved loved the margaritas!!! Awesome!! 
Food amazing!! This place have great service the bartender who made our margaritas was fantastic!! 
The steak had great flavor and is really well priced. 
We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for drinks here the other night and it was fabulous. It is located in the Renaissance Hotel lobby. The space is beautiful and the service is great. We weren't planning to eat there, but the menu was intriguing so we gave it a shot. Glad we did! The corn bread and cheese curds were great, but the cheese curds aren't your typical cheese curds. The taquitos were excellent and I wish they would make enchiladas out of that sauce. My friend raved about the pork wings, but I didn't try them because I don't eat pork."}
{"text":"I'm not usually into \"cowboy or western\" type decor, but this place is so cool and unique. Love the hanging lights with the vices! We had the Burrito Bowl with chicken and the Toasted Quinoa Bowl and I could eat these everyday and be happy. Delish! Great spot to hangout."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find while on business travel. Most hotel restaurants are blah. This place is inside The Renaissance Hotel, newly remodeled and has an awesome menu! 

The bar is beautiful and set up for socializing, looks like a great meeting spot after work or with friends. There are a few small tables but also has quite a few large hi top tables for large groups. Cute rustic lux feel. 

I had the chicken & waffles it was amazing in flavor even the watermelon was pickled and has a spicy kick. The chicken was tender and juicy and was a nice meal portion.I love the bourbon syrup you can definitely Taste the bourbon.... I may even have a lil buzzzzz Just don't pour the sauce over top as the waffle is lacking on the crunchy crisp of a perfect waffle so it will get soggy fast. I'd have given it 5 stars if it were crunchy!"}
{"text":"Nice casual downtown hotel bar and restaurant.  Food selection is limited but everything I've tried has been delicious.  Becca is a fantastic server and bartender.  She was very attentive, outgoing, and friendly.  She also makes a great cocktail!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a group of 10. First issue was trying to get that accomplished. I would leave a message and then get a return call several days later. The reservation was made for 6 pm and I told them we would all be arriving just after that and most would be there by 6:30. Well apparently guests started arriving around 6:20 so they gave the table away even though several other tables were open. Anyways that didn't ruin the night so they arranged another table in the back corner. The wait staff was terrible. I can definitely say I will never come back here again for anything more than a drink. It appeared that we were an inconvenience to the staff. At one point the waiter took a half full drink off the table without even asking. First thats rude and second they are over ten dollars each so now you are costing me money. I can go on and on about the issues we had but the other reviewers covered them as well. I was absolutely embarrassed by the service and apologized to my group for even thinking about this place. So many other places downtown that have way better service. I can say for a fact that was the worst waiter I have ever had. Never mind the fact we could hear them talking bad about us in the kitchen area right behind us. Due to the party size we were stuck paying an automatic 18 percent tip, definitely not worth that. I felt disgusted and embarrassed for this place. Never again!"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Modernish menu, but nothing to write home about.  Had the chorizo cheese crisp and some bacon-wrapped dates.  The server was good enough to warn us off of the chicken & waffles because they take a long time.  The food was yummy (& sorry to sound like another wannabe foodie dbag) but it was quite \"heavy-handed\".  The dates were waayyyy sweet.  The cheese crisp almost acidic in its saltiness.  Tasted ok mind you... just too intense.

Decent drinks.  The Cutter was nice, but not something I'd order again... a bit more tart than I was expecting.  My wife ordered the Mescalito - nice, but again [foodie dbag voice], lacked any kind of subtlety... smokey to the point of annoyance.

Service was pleasant and competent - when present... not sure if it's the size of the place or what, but they don't stop by... or really even show themselves very often.

Nice looking place and not too crowded on a night with a ballgame and concert a few hundred feet away.  

Not my first choice but not a terrible place to have a drink and snack with friends.

---------Update-----------
So, this is fun... The charge on my credit posted today... for exactly $80 more than I wrote in... It's both oddly round and not round... I guess maybe our servers thought $15 on $73 wasn't a fair tip?  I am pretty old, so maybe the 20% rule for decent service is no longer valid?  Maybe the new guidance is 130%?  Geez, I think I owe a lot of money to a lot of servers...  :-)

Anyway, called and spoke to a very nice person at the hotel (accounting, Racquel).  She's quite helpful and diligent in trying to solve the problem... Looks like the whole thing is a mess (it was a split tab between two parties and only one charge is showing (so they just put it all on my card - even though they definitely ran both cards and gave us two charge slips/receipts...)).  Racquel was good enough to run down threads and figure out what happened.   Seems for one reason or another they completely lost the other payment and rather than look at my receipt and question, they just did the convenient thing and charged it all to my card.  Lovely.

Cudos to the hotel staff (Racquel) for resolving expediently!

However, this definitely makes this restaurant a non-starter for me.  If staff can't operate the POS and closing managers can't be attentive enough to pick-up discrepancies, I wouldn't chance it here.   The food/drink wasn't terrible, but not worth wasting the time later to fix issues (or worse, missing the overcharge - it was just lucky that bill cycles today and I happen to be looking online)."}
{"text":"Been here serval times to grab some drinks and appetizers, and this place never disappoints! The bartender Tony is amazing. You can tell he really loves what he does and gets very creative with the drinks he makes. All of the food that I have ordered here is excellent. Try the bacon-wrapped dates, they are incredible! Just a great place to grabs a happy hour cocktail and some food!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Renaissance on the renovation and atmosphere. Being a downtown local, this is one of my new go-to's in the neighborhood. Christine and Arianna are always spot on with the bar service and the craft cocktail list is amazing. Great job guys, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Had lunch there recently. Chintzy poor on the wine but my server Rhonda noticed and rectified it. It was obviously an untrained person who poured initially. That said, the fish tacos were very bland, even with peppers. They were also teeny tiny - I weigh 115 pounds and I left lunch starving. I certainly won't be back for lunch. I have had the nachos at happy hour and they were much better."}
{"text":"Dust Cutter has always had an inviting look. I always wanted to stop by and check it out, and while waiting for a concert nearby at the Van Buren to start, we found ourselves here finally.

We walked up to the bar because I didn't recall seeing any hostess stands (unless we somehow missed). We pretty much looked lost until one of the staff just told us to sit anywhere. I chose a spot nestled next to a fireplace. It's not your traditional fireplace. It was sided with glass walls bordering a neat pile of pseudo logs and looked very modern. The tables were made of thick wood. Some tables were short and other bar height. Openness galore with TVs interspersed everywhere so that if any sports event was on, you'd be able to see it... but in a chic way.

The menus were already on the table so we just had to wait for a waitress to come take our orders. I kicked of our night with one of their signature cocktails, Snake in my Boot. I really enjoyed this cocktail. It did have a unique taste while surprising you with a spicy warm \"bite.\" Try it! Its base is El Silencio mezcal, which isn't my typical go-to, but I wanted something different.

For eats, I had a fajita carñitas bowl. It is reminiscent of a fancier Chipotle fajita bowl. It was good! I would order it again. 

We also had fried avocado as an appetizer. Since it had to be fried quite a bit on the outside to hold the structure of a soft avocado inside (allowing you to be able to eat it as a finger food like fat fries), it had the appearance of something else not as appetizing, but the flavor and the texture was good. Sure, we'd order this again too. 

My hubby had the fish tacos as his entrée. Honestly it looked super healthy to me (and thus not as exciting to me), but when given the chance, and I did take a bite, I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it and the black beans side! ...But nah, I would still order the fajita bowl again instead. 

So come check this place out! It's got a neat vibe, and they actually acknowledged our presence when Nook nearby did not."}
{"text":"Very cute place love the warehouse roll up doors And also love the Avacado Fries very yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The avocado fries and cheese and cheese curds were delicious! I can't say I've ever had avocado fried before, but I'm also surprised I've never seen the option on a menu before this. Two cheese crisps were also more than enough for three of us to share. It was surprisingly filling. My favorite was the fig and prosciutto, delicate balance of figs and arugula. Overall, food was good, but unfortunately service was slow for a partially filled restaurant for food you wouldn't expect to take that long.."}
{"text":"The major advantage of this place is that it is open late at night located in the Renaissance hotel.  Also I would give three $$$.  Now my review.

Service: Started out bad but after I hinted to my waiter/bartender that he was taking too long and nowhere to be found, never gave water, or table settings until after food came out, and food came out way before drink he improved.  

Food:
I really liked my cocktail which I think was the highlight of the meal the el pepino.
The bbq pulled pork was also tasty fresh and juicy and had enough acid  and the bread was crispy and fresh and nicely toasted. Downfall is that it never came with a side of sweet potato fries which you had to pay $5 extra since I just like a few fries I never ordered a whole side.

The dessert was a different story if it is not edible do not put it on a plate.  I was going to get the lemon meyer trifle but my waiter warned me that the sponge cake you would normally expect on a trifle was instead a biscuit topping so I chose the lime avocado cheesecake with pistachio crust and raspberry coulis.  What I got was an inedible disaster.  I was hoping for a light and fluffy cheesecake and what I got was something very very very dense that felt like you were eating butter.  No really it had no taste so it was like eating a whole stick of butter.  The crust also was graham cracker with no taste of pistachio.  Finally to add insult to injury the chef placed a very bitter raspberry sauce on top.  Which was so bitter it was inedible.  It seemed like it was a new chef trying to0 hard to be creative that he completely forgot about making something tasty which is a shame because dessert is my favorite course.  I really forced myself to take a second bite but that was extremely painful.   In the end the waiter saw I did not like the dessert and he took it off the receipt. After the dessert fiasco all I wanted was something normal and familiar like carrot cake or plain light and fluffy new york style cheesecake or a warm brownie with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream or tiramasu unfortunately these were not on the menu.

In the end the whole meal was hit or miss but give the severity of the misses I had to give the place two stars.  One more note is that the atmosphere is really nice and trendy but with that said some of the seats are not comfortable and I had to move to three different seats to find something comfortable which goes along with the theme hit or miss."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix for a work trip and stopped at Dust Cutter for a drink and had an extremely great experience at the bar! Tony waited on me and was very professional and provided outstanding customer service. He provided me with recommendations both for the Dust Cutter and for places in downtown Phoenix. Great employee! Keep up the great work! :)"}
{"text":"It was OK, step up from hotel fare, close to the convention center.  Prompt service."}
{"text":"The avocado fries and bacon-wrapped dates are to die for! Great vibe and delicious food."}
{"text":"Being the only customer in a restaurant is a telling sign. The wait for my sandwich and fries was minimal, but they made the wrong sandwich- not even close to what I ordered. The fries were clearly cooked before the sandwich and were lukewarm and limp. The waiter realized the sandwich problem and remade the correct sandwich but did not bring new fries. He left the first batch of disgusting fries on the table and thought that was good service... $15 wasted on an average sandwich and cold fries. Stayed at the hotel another four days and never went back. There's great food within a block."}
{"text":"Our first time here and not a good experience.  My husband's chicken sandwich was over cooked and it took forever to get a new one.  I ordered a burger and it took 10+ minutes to get ketchup.   I ordered a vodka lemonade and got a vodka grapefruit.  Server was slow and when the bill came we thought they might take the sandwich off or give us a free drink to compensate for bad experience, but NO!  Bill came to $74.39 plus tip.  Total rip off.  Won't be coming back here!  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Love the taquitos and the chorizo cheese crisp! Located inside the newly renovated Renaissance Downtown Phoenix! Slick as a whistle is one of their crafted cocktails and it's delicious! Definitely coming back soon!!! Staff very friendly and know of some great downtown treasures as well! Start at Dust Cutter and make your way through Downtown Phoenix for a fun night!!"}
{"text":"Celebrating my b-day! The avocado  fries were amazing! And nice lavender ice cream   dessert on the House.  Vibe is very high end. Loved the fire pit and the garage type windows that go up. Service was exceptional, particularly Becca! She was friendly and very nice. Love this place and will come again!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time in the dust cutter. Their menu was great and I loved the ability to take things up to my room if I wasn't going to finish at the table. Very friendly, helpful service."}
{"text":"Service is pretty terrible. 10 minute wait, one check-in by a disinterested bar maid 8 minutes in, at which time she shoved a menu at me, and then nothing else.  Walked out at the 10 minute mark. Not even a water. Tons of waiters walking around doing nothing -- other than ignoring a customer without a drink and/or food. This staff needs a lot of training.  Actually the manager needs to be replaced -- because it all starts at the top and rolls down. And this great service was for a Marriott Platinum guest of the hotel . . . ?"}
{"text":"While working the Final Four this year, I was staying in the Renaissance Hotel....so as you can imagine, this was a place I frequented as my schedule was quite busy. I tried the nachos, spicy chicken sandwich and BLATT. The spicy chicken sandwich was excellent and the perfect amount of spice. Being that this place is in a hotel, sometimes it was slow and other times it was super busy. Overall, the food was good and the service was generally on point."}
{"text":"As I noted in my last review, we did go back again. And again had another wonderful evening and delicious meal. This time, because the weather was cooler, all the doors to the outside were open, which made it even nicer.  Our waitress - Reetau I think is her name - was great fun to spend some time with and very helpful. We split the pork ribs and the Kale salad. I had the chicken and waffles - amazing - and Ric had the steak frites - also really good. No room for dessert - portions here will not disappoint. And their special cocktails are very unique and evil good. One area for improvement- timing in getting things to the table. The appetizer arrived well before our drinks, and our entrees arrived moments after the salad. It's a small inconvenience."}
{"text":"We had a happy hour for our organization this past Friday night, a group of 30. I worked with Julia to put together a menu that would accommodate our group, a variety of popular dishes. The food was fantastic - the bacon wrapped dates, taquitos, and bbq chicken cheese crisp were my favorites. The s'mores brownie was so good I'm still craving it to this day!! Thank you Dust Cutter, Brandy and Julia for your patience in making the menu perfect! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Live this recently redesigned lounge at The Renaissance in downtown Phoenix.  Excellent cocktails, good service and interesting small bites. The prosciutto and fig flatbread is amazing. Live to stop in here before concerts ballet or theater!!"}
{"text":"We are local downtown residents.  Decided to try this for happy hour on the way to a Diamondbacks game.  The food was good, but an additional charge of $6.00 for a tiny portion of chicken on their happy hour nachos, w/ no indication from the server or mention on the menu it was that much of an up charge and a ridiculous charge of$4 for a Diet Pepsi.  Our server also seemed not to interested in us, as we had to walk up to the bar for a pop refill.

Will probably not be returning.  Too bad b/c the food was good"}
{"text":"Nice bar.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  We had six people and they were not busy at lunch.  It took us over an hour to get our food.  My fries were stone cold and the bacon was not cooked.  The fish tacos were way too small - they looked almost like appetizers - it was over priced and also we couldn't get the waitresses attention to save our lives, even though the place wasn't busy.  Another disappointment for downtown."}
{"text":"Tony's cocktails are amazing!!!! He mixes the best drinks.. the lemon drop I had was great.. the melly yellow was also great..with the refreshing cucumber taste. Be sure to check out Tony and his bar over weekend nights ..."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd experience with Dust Cutter. The first time I went in they had only been open for about 2 months so I didn't expect much as a lot of restaurants need at least 6 months to get into a Rhythm. 

3 months later they seem to have regressed. We arrived at 4:05 pm and a person came over right away and was attentive for a few minutes but 15 minutes later when the rest of our party arrived we waited an additional 10 minutes for someone to come over. The next 90 minutes was just a waiting game of no one coming over. Finally, we called the hotel to ask for them to send someone over. It seems like this is a mother hotel bar that is aesthetically pleasing with service that is geared to not generating loyal local guests. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"ORDER THE AVOCADO FRIES! you will not be disappointed.The service was great! Thomas and Reetau were super nice and helpful explaining the menu. A great new restaurant in downtown Phoenix,
."}
{"text":"Went here with my sisters last night. We are staying in downtown Phoenix and looked for a fun place we hadn't been before. The service was great although it took us a minute to figure out it is open seating. Our waitress was friendly and attentive! We got the avocado fries and the cornbread as appetizers which were both delicious! I got one one the cheese crisps for my entree and loved it! Overall, it was a great dining experience. Enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I travel, a lot. I frequent restaurants, a lot. I'm a Lifetime Platinum Marriott member. (irrelevant) This dining experience was not ideal. Right out of the gate,  waitress served me someone else's appetizer. (stuffed dates)  It took 25 minutes for my burger and fries to arrive  but only because I asked.  The fries were soggy and cold confirmed by another guest (Steve) who tried a few just to make me feel like I'm not crazy. I asked to see the manager.  He came out 10 minutes later. Offered a beer, (P.S. I paid for it)  I accepted. I asked for new fries. Brought new hot fries. Soggy. It's not rocket science. Fries should be hot and not soggy.  Management has been notified and they responded with a promise to address the situation. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First rate service and unique eats.  The atmosphere is wonderful and unique.  I will be back.  Try the nachos"}
{"text":"We went to Dust Cutter because we heard great things about it and it definitely lived up to the hype. Our server was attentive and so nice, she even gave us recommendations for places to go while we were in Phoenix. I ordered a manhattan and it came out quickly and was DELICIOUS. I had the steak frites and the meat was so tender it melted in my mouth. The best meal I had while in town. 

The location is perfect for a nice dinner before hitting the town for the night. Everyone there was so nice and welcoming and we will definitely visit again next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Great menu but food listed not necessarily available. 

Service inconsistent.

Some Servers/bartenders new and some female. Noticed female staff favoring male guests--a continuing  stereotype in most eateries. I tip 110% + bcz I too am in service industry. But when I am disregarded due to gender and age, I will protest and refrain from tipping or tip very little...place is worth a visit but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"Located in the Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix, this is a nice little bar with food service, while the food is good, and reasonable priced for a hotel bar/restaurant the service is a little slow. They don't seem to have enough servers for the crowd that was there the night we stopped by. There were quite a few people in town for the ASU Commencement Ceremony and Many of there were at this hotel. 
Had the Steak Frites and it was perfectly cooked, wife had the pulled Pork Sandwich and it was huge and tasty, daughter and her husband had burgers, everything was very tasty. Server was very nice, just seemed a little overwhelmed by the number of people. 
Would recommend them if you are in the hotel and need a quick bite or just want to go out for something to eat."}
{"text":"You really can't beat Dust Cutter. Really great food, Plenty of large TVs to catch a game on, and a solid selection of tasty cocktails and local beers to sip on! This is a far cry from your typical hotel bar/restaurant. The menu is full of personal favorites like the avocado fries, taquitos, and a stellar hamburger offering in the Sonoran burger. If you find yourself downtown after a game or concert you would do well to drop into dust cutter and check it out!"}
{"text":"Tony Escalante was our bar tender here and he made amazing drinks, took care of us in a matter of seconds every time. Had our shots perfectly made. Kept the conversation great. Also recommended places since it's my first time to Phoenix. But get the lemon drop shot it was amazing! Thank you Tony for being an AWESOME BARTENDER and I live in Vegas and he definitely tops them!"}
