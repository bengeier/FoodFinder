{"text":"I could not have a more different opinion of this place from the other 2 reviews. It literally put me off of Indian food for long time. I did not find the food to be terribly fresh, as though it had been sitting in those chafing dishes for hours. It looked completely unappetizing, and tasted oily and bland. After a few bites I stopped eating.... they certainly got their money's worth out of me considering I ate pennies worth of nan bread and a few bites of food!   I tried to keep my dining partner good company... he happily ate for 2 and didn't share my sentiments, but I've since spoken with several Montrealers who reassured me that Buffet Maharaja pales in comparison to other Indian restos in the city, upscale (Le Taj, Bombay Palace) and bargain (Bombay Mahal- excellent) alike. On the bright side, the service was good and the atmosphere comfortable."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Considering that this is a buffet, the food is well prepared and exceptionally fresh. The variety helps to ensure that there is probably something for everyone.  If this were strictly an ala cart restaurants, I would probably only give it 3 stars. But, as this is a buffet, the quality of food is4 stars in it's category."}
{"text":"I always come to Buffet Maharaja when I visit Montreal. Maybe not the best Indian food, but much more than passable. Good buffet selection, w/many vegetarian options. Excellent naan; sadly, I'm now tied to a gluten-free diet. And incidentally, Maharaja is not dirty, the waiters don't smell bad, but going to the restroom *is* an opportunity to walk off some calories. Worth trying in a city that has so many fine restaurants."}
{"text":"Worst quality of Indian food I ever had. No variety even for dinner - both the veg and non-veg selection was limited and the same curry was used in multiple dishes. The veg food had no labels on it - so VEGETARIANS BEWARE! Very pricey -- which was even more frustrating!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian buffet with limited selection, even though I think it said 100+ items on a sign on the exterior? If I had bothered to read the reviews beforehand I wouldn't have gone. And they are accurate. I think there were four or five main dishes, one of them butter chicken and one lamb, and none were particularly tasty. The naan was decent though, as were the papads, so I had a carb heavy lunch. There must be better Indian options around in such a restaurant filled city, so I would recommend avoiding this one."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food is pretty ordinary, you could find way better Indian/Pakistani food in Montreal. Every item on their menu is either oily or too spicy although to their credit they have a lot of variety of vegetable and meat dishes (as well as entrees, fruits, desserts, breads and rice). Basically I would go to a proper restaurant and order a dish that I like than go to Maharaja for a buffet. Probably the only thing going for them is that they are the only Indian Buffet in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews but being South Asian I feel obliged to warn people about this place! Stay away this is the worst sample of my cuisine!  I visited several years back and found it terrible. I made the mistake of going again as I had been assured that the management had changed and the food had improved. Bad decision!  The quality and taste of food was beyond extremely poor - badly cooked, unfresh, flavourless food. Considering that is a buffet, the choice of dishes was pathetic... there was not one dish from the disappointingly small spread that pleased the taste buds. The dishes and cutlery need to be replaced and the loud Indian music blaring off a large screen TV was very annoying.  In short, I will never eat there again even if I'm paid to. There are many better options in a city like Montreal."}
{"text":"To be honest, it used to be average almost garbage. I decided to go for lunch today. First of all, first floor is now closed, the restaurant is on the basement level. Entrance has been improved and let me tell you so was the food, the service and everything!  I believe they changed management as the owner is white. Servers are still Indian. Food covered a nice and fresh salad bar, 4 meat curries (including a light and really good butter chicken), 4 vege curries, white rice, regular naan bread and potato naan bread, cauliflower patties, soups and chicken tandoori (special mention to the extra savoury onion rings). For desert, there were mille-feuilles, choux à la crème, ice cream and the zalabia. Not a huge list of choices but enough I think.  The server even brought us a fresh and hot garlic naan bread.   Prices haven't changed. Honestly, it was really good and I enjoyed it compared to the last time I went.  Disappointment comes only from the bathrooms for myself, they weren't exactly clean."}
{"text":"In contrast to the other reviews I really enjoyed this restaurant.  Maybe I just so happened to go there on a night when they were on point.  Or maybe because I live in Boston where we are really lacking good, authentic Indian food.  But we absolutely loved the food here, which can be very surprising for a buffet.  So many choices and everything was delicious.  I have been craving it ever since and been so disappointed not to be able to find anything similar locally.  Next time we're in Montreal we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had a group of nine for lunch on Saturday.  The server was very attentive and provided us with 3 full sized naan breads to share at the table.  That was the highlight..the naan arrived hot and still crispy.  The rest of the buffet fare was so-so.  The lamb should have been stewed for longer, the meat was still tough to cut from the bone.  The butter chicken was watery and favorless.  The Tandoori chicken was dry.  Not the best Indian buffet I have tasted for $15.  The washrooms in the basement needed cleaning and was out of paper towels."}
{"text":"I ignored the low ratings because I was starving, craving Indian, and it was literally a block from where I was staying. I should have looked elsewhere. While there was a reasonably large selection for the buffet, the food was terrible--the lassi was too sweet, and while appropriately spicy, I've had better tasting and better quality food at other buffets in my hometown (and the Indian I've had in some big cities makes home look bad)."}
{"text":"Even after reading the reviews i went to try the food. But i realized i did a big mistake. Environment is not good, forget about the service, nobody cares, i refilled my water glass by going towards the counter and getting my own jug of water. Actually nobody works their everything is taken care by one person, kitchen, service etc .Quality of food is too bad. The yogurt smells bad and the meat is half cooked. I suggest everybody please don't take a chance."}
{"text":"It's a buffet... amazing selection and great price at lunch... a bit more at dinner.. but if you're hungry (very hungry), craving indian and you're not picky about the \"nicest\" place in town.. this is the place to go. I thought the taste was quite good, not the best butter chicken... but everything else was really good.. and super filling."}
{"text":"It's difficult to give this place a star. Pretty much all 100 items taste alike and you get stuck with a bill for 20 bucks per head. Take this from an Indian who was starving. Ok, the only silver lining was their samosa. Ok 20 bucks for 2 samosas."}
{"text":"Don't slip on the floor!!  The steam from all the food makes the floor soaking wet.  Pretty gross if you ask me.  For some reason i just felt that the place was dirty.  The food was average and you could tell it had been sitting there for a while.  Save your money and go get something good down the road."}
{"text":"I've never tasted such tasteless menu. As being of East Indian descent, the food was bland, below Indian standards. There was no taste in the food, especially the vegetarian options.   The variety of desserts especially the Indian desserts were displeasing to the eyes.   The vegetable naan bread given the fact it has mashed vegetables inside it, was empty and had a yellow - ish color to it.   I would definitely not visit this place again and I would recommend others to do their own research."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them 3 stars because the service was very friendly but I was distracted by the commercials playing in the background! One of the tvs was playing the show \"How it's made\"...  The buffet was ok at the beginning but when you start paying closer attention, you quickly run out of options. The butter chicken is not chicken breast, the pieces of chicken were very fatty and the sauce completely tasteless! The rest is just about the same; starts off good till you realize that the quality is just not there.  Dont be fooled by the buffet; go elsewhere to satisfy your Indian craving!"}
{"text":"Just worst  Never ever go to this place. Expired food. Stupid staff. No taste and real expensivevv"}
{"text":"Le pire restaurant indien de Montréal. Pas beaucoup de choix et nourriture sans saveur, qualité des aliments douteuse...  Très cher payé pour un buffet et service qui laisse à désirer.  Bref, allez ailleurs...autre que dans un buffet."}
{"text":"Well, I didn't really want to go after seeing all the negative reviews but could not turn down an invitation from a friend for his birthday.  Lets get started. Not really so called authentic Indian cuisine, but more of a mix of cuisines from central provinces of India. I went on a quiet weeknight in freezing cold but it didn't really disappoint. While some of the food were very dry and bland  but some were extremely classy and delicious.   Butter chicken is their primary, but god they make it good even without cashews and pistachios, mind you its a peanut free place. Spinach lamb follows the same path with other curry dishes.Naan is staple bread but expensive, their waiters still served them to each and every table and more if being asked, now no Indian restaurant actually do that these days. Only downfall, vegetarian dishes were dry, i believe the staffs did not change the trays and they had onion rings and french fries, oh please its an Indian Buffet.  My waiter was quite dynamic and seemed to have quite a good knowledge about  origin and ingredients of Indian food. His suggestion was to go for dining during their Saturday night, which is the busiest and the best day by far he said.  Its a good place for events and to dine with families too.  I believe its worth giving it a try on Saturday night too."}
{"text":"My wife and I have a personal connection with this place.  For in 2008 it was here that it was the first time we had Indian food as well as it being the first time we went to Montreal. It was only later on that I realised we also had middle eastern food at this place.  I went back again in 2013 to relive the ambiance and be reminded of younger years of dating.  Now back to the food.  The food was delicious.  The chicken tiki Marsala was delicious and the chicken briyani was spectacular.  My wife loved the sweets as she has quite the sweet tooth. It being a buffet I got to try most dishes. I enjoyed almost every dish that was mild to medium spicy as my palate could not handle the spiciest dish.  Will definitely come back here again the next time we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch while in Montreal for vacation. The following should be a good summary of our experience:  Selection: Lots of different items to select from. Plenty to make a vegetarian or meat eater quite pleased. Quality: Meat items do not get resupplied too often and some dishes you need to go through the tray with a fine toothed comb to find meat. Also, lots of the meat dishes have more bone than meat. Flavour: Did not find the food to be bland and spicy when it was supposed to be. However, the complexity found in most true indian dishes was missing from those dishes which were not dominated by spice. Atmosphere: Very nice location and the walk downstairs to the bathroom past the waterfall and fish should not be missed. However, ventilation was bad and it was quite hot inside. Price: Very fair given the prices for other items in town. Students even get 10% discout.  In summary, if we are in Montreal and are in need of some Indian, this location is a sure bet, however, we would try a different place if within vicinity."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food, but this place was decent. I usually try to avoid Indian food, as it's not my favorite cuisine, but it was my boyfriend's birthday, and he loves Indian food, so this is where we went.  The selection of food was huge, there was so much to choose from. There was some sort of weird cabbage dish that I fell in love with. The butter chicken was also pretty good.   They are not lying when they say the spicy section is spicy. It's refreshing to find that in restaurants now, which I believe feel pressured to cater to more timid palates.  The only downfall here, and its something I always find weird at ethnic buffets, is the food that doesn't belong. Like pizza and french fries. I know that it is done to appeal to kids most likely, but there was honestly so much to choose from, even a picky kid probably could have found something other than pizza and fries."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service.  Half empty.  Rock hard balls of grease called pakoras.  Crusty jello, yes, crusty.  Warm sweet lassi.  No one to take the dishes away.  View overlooking a construction waste bin.  Lighting they forgot to turn on, and when they did, it was glaring.  I'm guessing that the positive reviews below are from family members."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly service/staff just visiting Montreal ordered some pakora and Nans asked for chutney they did not have container Nans were half done had to bake them @ home will not recommend this place"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the buffet.  There was a large selection and there was something for everybody in my group, lots to choose from.  It might not be considered as totally and completely authentic, but hey, the place was clean, the food tasted good, and the service was friendly and efficient.   I'm definitely going to return."}
{"text":"Very okaish place. The food was not that great. The place needs to be revamped. The bar area (I guess non operational) seemed unhygienic. Even the ice cream section seemed too shoddy with old deep freezer and tasteless ice creams. I don't think there is anything the servers or waiters can do here. The management needs to get this placed cleaned up and painted.   Vegetarian food did not taste fresh. The cutlery was way too old. The deserts were horrible.   A suggestion : cook less, cool good and keep the place clean and ventilated. 8 good dishes are better than over 25 average dishes.   I was just a visitor on a trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Indian food I have ever had. Went a few times when it was upstairs and it was ok but now it is awful. Very poor choice and the quality is awful, the beef curry had burger bites instead of real meat. Best thing was the fresh nan they brought to the table. Salad bar is large but garbage, had one plateful of food and left. didn't check out the toilets but the dining room was dirty enough so dread to think what the toilets were like. I wouldn't give it one star but you can't post a review unless you do."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm a through and through foodie who was raised in India. In short - I know my Indian food. Enough said.  Lets get down to business. Decent place with lots of room and very spacious. It only serves buffet .. Duh! The spread is big for a buffet that costs under 20 bucks including taxes. The taste however, is a bit bland. The food is not always fresh - quite typical for a buffet!   Although I didn't enjoy the taste of the food very much, the service was fair. The staff was courteous and they smiled!  Great dessert selection. Again - not the most authentic though.  All in all, a reasonable place to pig out when you're hungry and don't really care about the taste so much. I wouldn't go there for a family dinner though ..."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a visit and expected the food to be good at this place as it was mentioned in Hyatt's guide book. The food was bad, smelly bathroom and the waiters seem to have a big problem when it comes to bill payment(as mentioned in one of the other reviews too). Chicken butter masala and roasted chicken were tasteless, Pathetic ice cream. I would recommend trying some other places if you have an option. This ones not worth it."}
{"text":"THE WORST MOST HORRID HORRID HORRID HORRID HORRID BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD AND WORST THAN INFINITELY BAD restaurant in the world. There are flies swarming the heating trays. The food looks radioactive due to all the food colouring. The floors are slippery and it is disgustingly humid because of all the condensation from the heating trays. This place is a shitty mess. Buffet Maharaja is like paying a stranger on the street to vomit regurgitated putrid sewage back into my mouth. This is horrid Indian food and most likely the worst restaurant in Montréal. This places boasts a hundred different dishes in their buffet and they all taste the same. You will be disappointed to see that everything is stored in aluminium slosh buckets heated underneath with propane burners. This is never a good sign. Also a very bad sign is when an Indian resto is soooooooooo shitty and desperate that they've got to serve stale French fries. This is a pitiful and sad state of affairs. It boggles the mind to think that this awful awful place is still in business after all of these years. This is one of the oldest Indian restos in the city. I remember back in the 90s that they used to run advertisements on the television. Either local CBC or CFCF12 or Global. Or maybe it was SRC I forget. There was soft core porn late at night and I think between programmes Buffet Maharaja would come on and brag about how they had like a hundred different items. The first time I went there was when I was a teenager and I knew it was absolute shit. But hey! Unlimited food! And they served me beer even though I was underage. I went back about a year ago just because I'm an optimist but it still sucks donkey balls. Go anywhere else. See my other reviews for suggestions. Peace out."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went for lunch a few weeks back and for sure ill be back. I love a good Indian buffet and this place did not disappoint. The buffet is huge with lots of options for me as a vegetarian. Lunch price was more than reasonable. Decor is bright and airy. If I could say one thing it would be the desserts (not like I needed it) , the icecream was generic out of the tub and wasn't a big fan of the rice pudding. A lot of the other desserts as well sort of looked like something you'd find in a cafeteria line. But as I mentioned it was just as well because I had already eaten more than necessary trying to get all my favorites in."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Service was slow and indifferent. The food was bland.  Bland curry, what's that? Not much.  The food is plentiful, there's variety (at least there's a number of name cards over the items) but then again it's a buffet. It's inexpensive but so what? I've had much better Indian food at a local food court in a shopping mall.  So - pros: it's cheap and it's a buffet.  - cons: it's not great. Not even close."}
{"text":"Great for large groups.  Okay service.  Okay food.  Somewhat expensive for their buffet when compared to other Indian restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"The place is huge, it's downtown Montreal, it has free parking at the back (a big plus downtown) and you get good value for your money.  The best Indian in town it's not.  The biggest indian buffet it is.  Great for a group and with kids."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about...  Butter Chicken was No good in taste and not even properly heated...  Saag chicken was ok ..  Everything else was pretty sub-standard .."}
{"text":"Quality, value, selection. All of the Indian cuisine staples. The dessert, particularly the ice cream (which was old) was not impressive."}
{"text":"We planned to have a feast here on our way back to Toronto from Quebec. It was a rainy day and the place was fairly busy, so we had to park on the street.  The food is decent and has a wide range of choices. This place is probably the biggest buffet place in downtown Montreal, and if you are craving to feast on Indian food then it is a good place to be.  The interior of the restaurant is nice and we got our seats quite easily.   The price per person is something I do not recall exactly, but it was less than $15 if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"My Indian parents, who between them have been to Indian restaurants in dozens of countries on 5 continents, declared to me that this was the best one they'd ever been to in their life. So, during my next trip to Montreal, I tried it and agreed with their expert opinion. Kind of an odd thing to say about a \"buffet\" style Indian restaurant, but Maharaja is kind of like a high-end buffet if you can picture that.   Anyway, I've been to Maharaja a million times and make sure to come on every trip I make to Montreal. I saw the infamous US judge Robert Bork there once."}
{"text":"Contrainte d'y aller pour cause d'anniversaire d'une amie, j'ai été absolument déçue par ce buffet terne et sans saveur. La subtilité de goût que l'on recherche habituellement dans la cuisine indienne fait cruellement défaut dans leur bouffe, qui manque royalement d'épices. Bof, bof, bof.  Comme nous étions un groupe, le pourboire était inclus dans la facture totale, qui s'élevait à près de 30$. 30$ pour un repas médiocre dans une ambiance moche, et avec un service nul, ça fait beaucoup!"}
{"text":"Went for the $10.99 lunch buffet, and it was fairly tasty. The selection is 3X that of most Indian buffets, with decent quality and decent spice on the meat dishes, although the chicken tandoori was dry. Not as flavorful as smaller places I've been to, but not bad."}
{"text":"Unlimited GULAB JAMUN!  I don't find it as bland as some other reviewers do, but maybe I'm just a sucker for buffets."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the WORST Indian food I've had in my entire life and trust me I've had Indian food in at least 14 cities in 5 different countries. The waiter was so rude and demanding. he brought the bill without us asking and he was expecting something like a 20% tip!  I'd rather die of starvation and not step foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"Good variety, however the food was rather bland and didn't taste very fresh. For $18 I am sure you can do better on a Saturday night!!  My teenage son complained the tandoori chicken was tasteless, but he did enjoy the naan. Overall, I would avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"Pro:   - Attentive wait staff. Granted, I was one of the two customer there.  - Sugary, buttery, and most unauthentic sweet balls that I've ever tasted, and it's warm too.  Con:  - Very colorful but extremely tasteless, hardened food. It's under-salted and under-spiced. If we're not counting the color, just the flavor. Their bright red tandoori chicken and creamy yellow-orange butter chicken taste almost the same as microwaved hospital chicken.  - Disgusting ice-cream section, only 2 out of 4 buckets has ice-cream, and it looked filthy.  - After 35 minutes of dining, the waiter brought me my cheque and credit card machine, while I'm still eating.  - Small selection of food for a buffet (about half as much of selections), even less selection of deserts.  -Flies  - Quite pricey for a buffet"}
{"text":"This place is an abomination. Absolutely deplorable food. All meat items had stale taste to it and to make things worse everything was lukewarm. Avoid this place like the plague!"}
{"text":"The local press reports it was fined again for its lack of hygiene... for the 8th time  Insalubrité au buffet Le resto du boulevard René-Lévesque est devenu un abonné des inspecteurs  Le restaurant bien connu Maharaja a aussi sa réputation auprès des inspecteurs de la Ville, qui viennent de lui coller une huitième amende pour son insalubrité.  Gouttes de gras en suspension sur la hotte, série d'explosions de nourriture dans le micro-ondes, aliments en putréfaction sous une planche à découper, moisissures dans l'évier. Ça ne semble pas s'améliorer pour le restaurant Maharaja.  Le buffet indien montréalais situé au 1481, boulevard René-Lévesque Ouest a reçu le 31 mars deux amendes de 2700 $ et une de 2500 $ pour sa malpropreté. Ce sont des visites des inspecteurs en juin 2014, janvier 2015 et mai 2015 qui ont conduit un juge à imposer ces peines.  Le propriétaire actuel, Ali Hossain Khan, a reçu quatre amendes en trois ans. Il a été condamné à un total de 9400 $ pour ces fautes. L'homme d'affaires ne nous a pas rappelés.  Le précédent proprio avait lui aussi reçu quatre amendes, pour un total de 11 500 $, pour la malpropreté, la température dangereuse des aliments et une infestation de vermine.   Moisi et gras  En mai 2015, la visite des inspecteurs a mal débuté. À peine entrés dans la cuisine, ils ont soulevé une planche à découper pour constater qu'une odeur fétide s'y dégageait. Le dessous de la planche était couvert de moisissures. Dans la cuisine, le micro-ondes \"était incrusté dans une épaisse couche de matière gluante noirâtre\", écrivent les inspecteurs dans leur rapport.  La hotte était quant à elle pleine de gouttes de gras qui menaçaient de tomber sur les chaudrons en dessous. Propreté et saleté se côtoyaient jusque dans la vaisselle. \"Des ustensiles de travail malpropres étaient placés parmi les propres dans un emballage de papier souillé et des résidus alimentaires séchés\", lit-on.  Plus loin, on a constaté le même problème de moisi sous les tablettes de la chambre froide. Pas étonnant puisqu'une eau stagnante puante se trouvait sur le plancher.  En comparant les photos et les rapports de la précédente visite en janvier, on constate que la situation ne s'était pas vraiment améliorée en quatre mois.  http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/05/27/insalubrite-au-buffet"}
{"text":"Will give it 0 stars. Worst Indian food I've ever had. This place used to be so good with over 100 varieties. Largest Indian Buffet in North America. Now they hardly even have 10. Don't even think about it when you go to Montreal."}
{"text":"First I must admit that I`m a Floridian that usually takes an annual one week Holiday every Summer to Montreal not only to hopefully escape briefly to cooler weather but to get my Smoked Meat and Poutine (fix).  That as well as a few Dim Sum outings in Chinatown.  I always include doing at least one Indian Buffet for Lunch.  Over the past decade and a half I have tried several different Indian Restaurants in Montreal and up until the past few years, Maharaja Buffet usually lived up to its boasting of being the \"best and biggest\" in North America.  Since they closed several years ago briefly for major renovations, IMO, both the selection and quality of their offerings have degraded.  I also found very irritating that when requesting an \"Indian Beer\" they repeatedly served a (domestically) brewed Beer that had a Label indicating it was supposed to be an Indian Beer?  I`ve dined at countless Indian Restaurants throughout the US and Canada and they always offered a nice selection of different (Imported) Indian Beer/Ale/IPA`s.  May sound a bit picky but personally I`d rather be served a Molson Export, Labatt`s 50 or an O`Keefe Biere then a imitation Indian Beer knockoff."}
{"text":"An Indian buffet, what is there to say? Lukewarm food, half of which caters to the chicken-sh!t losers afraid to eat ethnic food. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food and this has to do with the spices and seasoning used, also the \"slop\" look of most dishes throw me off a bit, but I like it well enough but I can't go on a tangent of authenticity since I know little of its history. However the food here is passable. The service is HORRIBLE and smelly. I know, I know sounds like I'm stereotyping Indians here, but seriously 2 of the server smelled like they hadn't taken a shower in a few days and were unaware of this nifty new-fangled invention called antiperspirants or deodorants. It was disturbing. If the wait staff's hygiene is not monitored, I fear for what's going on in the back of the house. One good thing... fresh made Naan bread."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious food at an affordable price. They have so many items to choose from, and there is always something for everyone. I loved the butter chicken and the coconut shrimp. There are also some American foods like fries and onion rings. Loads of appetizers, breads/rice, meat curries, seafood, vegetable items, salads, and desserts."}
{"text":"I will be adding to the fair amount of existing reviews for the Maharaja Buffet by saying I went with my fiancé earlier tonight and we had a good time. We had previously both looked at Yelp for reviews and we weren't sure what to expect; it seemed some people really loved it while others disliked it. Well, we liked it!  We liked the food; although the food was not crispy fresh (after all, it's a buffet so it can be expected that any dish remaining more than 5 minutes in a heated plate will be slightly wet, it's perfectly normal) it was tasty, good and quite fulling. The ambiance was nice, the waiter polite and efficient, and if you get to sit in the back you'll have a nice view of the city.  Now, vegetarians who like buffets will be pleased; about half their selection is made of vegetarian dishes. Even my fiancé who eats meat took and enjoyed the veggie food.   Maharaja Buffet might not be the fanciest place in town but it is nice, cosy and good. We'll certainly go back in the future.  P.S. They take credit card, however it seems they do not take debit as we saw an ATM machine at the entrance."}
{"text":"Oh Boy. Buffet Maharaja is actually one of the first restaurants I had been into Montreal 6-7 years back so I have some ...err personal attachments to this place. I've had my brothers reception, my own reception, and a couple of other big family events here so I dont know how else can I rate this place. The service here is of average just like most indian restos. I guess its a hit and miss thing on who is serving you on the day of. I have had some good experiences with the staff.. some really mediocre.   With all that I love the decor here, the lady owner of the place was really lovely and it showed how much she cared for the place. This place is one of the few indian restaurants that does a good clutter/crowd free job at decoring with an indian vibe.  The food? Hmm well Honestly, buffets are never really my favorite places to eat out at so I always have zero expectancy out of the food. But the food here? Again a real hit and miss. I personally love their chicken biryani, plain rice and butter chicken. I am also a fan of the pakoras but even sometimes I found them to be really dry and unbearably hard on the mouth. Meh! But they do have a good selection and variety. My best guess is come on a Friday night or Saturday as apparently they prepare everything special as they expect big groups on those two days.  Here is why I added a 4th star here. The Sweets. I am telling you folks the sweets here are incredible. The new chef here has recently come from Bangladesh and is one of the best sweetmakers from the country. Why is he working his talents at Buffet Maharaja? I dont know, but I all I do is that the whole bengali community has gone insane. They have real milky roshogullahs, chom chom, roshmalais, laddoos and other sweet goodies oh and lets not forget my most favorite mishti doi :) (sorry for not knowing the english names :(...) Anyway I sometimes just come in here for the sweets itself. They even do fresh orders if you're ordering for more.  Heres to some real authentic Bengali sweets! YEAHHH"}
{"text":"Awful, awful service. Our waiter sat us down and didn't turn up again for 10 minutes, not even to ask us if we needed anything to drink. We eventually got up to get our food.  The food itself was passe. Some items were cold and barely edible. The dessert selection was decent and was the saving grace.  They had advertised that students get a 15% discount and at the end when a few of my friends tried using their (non-photo) university id card + passport as proof, the waiter interrupted them mid-sentence and practically yelled at us that he didn't make the rules and couldn't accept it. A polite no would have done the job but he had to yell and make a scene. When the time to sign the bill came, we all concluded that the service was not tip-worthy. Here comes the classy part - he stands over us watching how much my friend tipped and when he didn't tip, he YELLS again at him saying \"That's the line where the tip goes , why are you leaving it empty?\". My friend caved and gave him a tip. I wish we'd complained to the manager, but I don't know if that would have done anything given the other reviews. In summary, skip this if you are ever in Montreal. You are much better off eating at one of the other Indian places downtown."}
{"text":"I had not been here since 2012...it went through a lot of changes, now the dinning hall is smaller, the buffet has fewer choices and the food went from average to junk...don´t bother"}
{"text":"J'ai mis les pieds qu'une seule fois chez Maharaja.  En 1998.  Mon premier indien.    Quelle déception !  Tout était sec et tout goûtait très fort le cari.  Le service était moche, inefficace et sans sourire...  J'ai tellement été rebutée par mon expérience de la cuisine indienne que je n'ai remis les pieds dans un resto indien que 8 ans plus tard, en 2006, pour un souper de groupe, l'anniversaire d'un ami.  Le Royal Gandhi, si je ne m'abuse sur St-Laurent (et Fairmont, coin Nord-Est)... Malheureusement, cet endroit a dû fermer boutique.  Le Royal Gandhi m'a par contre (et heureusement !) fait découvrir une délicieuse cuisine.  J'ai depuis mangé à plusieurs restos indiens de Montréal et n'ai jamais été déçue ; l'indien, c'est bien épicé et savoureux... délicieux, quoi ! et on se fait habituellement bien servir (avec un sourire s.v.p. !).    I have now moved on to way much better ! ^_^  Enfin, ma seule et unique visite au Buffet Maharaja en était une de trop.  Ne fréquentez pas cet endroit... allez ailleurs ; passez à autre chose sans même passer par ici s.v.p. !"}
{"text":"Besides the limited choices (around 10), which is fair for the amount you pay ($15 for lunch), I have nothing against this place. I admit not knowing a lot about this cuisine but taste-wise, this place was great! Will be back for the 50% off Tuesday lunches for students."}
{"text":"Surprised by all the bad reviews. :/  Hubby and I ate here today. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. The buffet food was good and everything tasted fresh. Pistachio ice cream dessert with warm fried ball (don't remember the name) that the waiter recommended was delicious.. Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Extreme poor quality indian food. Naan was extremely  undercooked and was pure dough. Curries were diluted and cold. Told the manager my concerns he said the restaurant caters to its populations tastes and only for indian events he makes more authentic spicy food. Please go elsewhere, this restaurant gives indian food a terrible name and is nothing close to authentic."}
