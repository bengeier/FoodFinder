{"text":"This place does a good job with their food and the beer prices are very reasonable. I've been here several times in the past year or so and really don't want to give up on it but my last two visits (June / July 2014) have been met with the worst service I have encountered that I can ever remember anywhere.   Our server was more interested in her boyfriend at the bar than actually doing her job.   Place was nearly empty while glasses remained empty, food orders were forgotten, drink orders forgotten, requests for condiments forgotten, request for separate bills denied.  The list goes on....... I'm not even sure forgotten can be used to describe it....... Ignored may be more appropriate...  The bartender who appears to manage the place or more, is clearly aware of the service problems but takes no action.   I've had several things on the menu all have been above average for pub food. They also have a great steak sandwich that they practically give away...  I sadly have to give up on this place though because the service is just that bad..........  Bye bye Beckhams.   Good luck."}
{"text":"Try the dill pickle wings!   Just don't go on a night the Flames are playing. The pub has a loyal crowd that shows up for games, wings and ribs.  As the other two reviews mention, the pizza is great here, too."}
{"text":"We are pretty much addicted to this pizza. Delivery is friendly, food is hot when it gets here and delicious."}
{"text":"yum, yum, yum!   I love heading to Beckhams for wing night, their roasted garlic wings are delish!  Quality of service is hit and miss but what can you expect when getting such great deals on the food.  There have been times that we get our order within 10 minutes of ordering, other times it has taken nearly an hour.   We have been in and eaten off the regular menu as well...the amount of food is crazy and all tastes great!"}
{"text":"I've been to Beckham's a few times over the past couple of years.  The pizza at this place is quite delicious and the food has always been pretty good.  Service has never really been Beckham's strong point and unfortunately last night the service was completely and utterly dismal.    Our team headed over after our game to find the place quite busy with a number of other teams already there.  It took awhile for the server to bring menus to our table.  After finally taking our order, the table waited for an order of wings and a quesadilla.  After an hour of waiting, the server apologized and said our order was stuck behind another big order.  However, while we were waiting, one of our teammates came later than the rest of us, ordered and got his pizza before our wings and quesadilla.  I have no idea how the mix-up happened and what was going on with the kitchen last night but we left hungry and pretty miffed.  While their team specials are really good, I've never really been a big fan of Beckham's to begin with and this particular experience will almost guarantee that I will not be returning to Beckham's anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Prices aren't bad, but if a waitress rounds down my change when bringing it back, it's your last opportunity at my business."}
{"text":"Good pub. Nice to experience happy and responsive table waiting. Beckham's makes it look easy, by making a good pizza with generous topping choices at a fair price. One of my favourites is shrimp, feta and mushrooms. (I haven't had many other items on their menu). How hard can it be?! yet so many other pubs just don't get it.  Bravo Beckhams."}
{"text":"Started coming to Beckham's when our usual Wed night wing destination began boarding up before 11 p.m. I love the service at Beckham's, it really is fantastic. They also have a ratio of one TV per customer, which means you get your fill of sports hi-lights without craning your neck.   The food is pretty \"pub\" but it's good. In fact the giant burial mound of nachos is so huge, we've never been able to eat our way through it.   Love to see some more beer choices on the taps, but at least what they have is fresh. If you're up in the industrial NE, this might be a good destination. Surprisingly busy on week-nights, which tells you that the food and service is good and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I ordered pizza over the weekend. Being new to the city and looking for something other than the chain brand. I remembered the flyer I received for beckhams. The price was not outrageous for a large with wings and pop. And the delivery time was acceptable. First we tried the wings. We order the dill pickle. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the lack of dill pickle. The wings on their own were quite good and crunchy without the batter. Next we popped the lid of our pizza. At first glance it looked succulent. A deep dish style pizza lathered in scrumptious cheese. I love my pizza cheesy. Ample toppings accompanied our salivating excitement. However, the first bite changed our lives for the worse. It's not that beckhams pizza was terrible, it was an illusion. It was the cologne after 4 days un-bathed. There was something about the sauce. It was bland. Change the sauce beckhams and you might be able to throw that cologne bottle at some unwashed person.   Cheers,  Side note: the barqs root beer was exactly barqs root beer."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and looking for a lunch spot. Found Beckham's while driving around.  Place was absolutely packed when I went inside! That's a good sign. Took a while to get service, guess that's understandable being a single patron. Had a nice glass of cab and ordered the chicken club sandwich. My only complaint was it was pretty skimpy on the chicken side. Overall taste was good. Also had a Greek salad which was one of the best ones I've ever had. It's always fun to find places like this. I'll definitely come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Beckham's completely exceeded my expectations.  I visited last week with friends for drinks.  We ordered the wings and pizza and both were delicious!  We were so blown away by how good the food was, we went back 2 days later.  This time we ordered several items from the menu, and every single one was awesome.  I would highly recommend this place for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Came to eat here. Was pretty dead when we arrived. Sat down, read menu, waited 10 - 15 minutes for a waiter. Watched several staff members wondering around pretty aimlessly. Decided to leave. Crappy service. Sure we didn't miss much in terms of their food..."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. (We had the Mexican Supreme).Crust was perfect. Beer was cold. Bill was very resonable. Lots of TV's good music. Will be back. Wish it was in walking distance from my house. Service was very good. Even the bartender left the bar and came across to us and asked us if we needed another drink."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on delivery. My brother-in-law swears by the pizza here and we got some delivered the other night. Crazy snow storm out and it arrived quick and hot and DELICIOUS!! That is some of the best pizza I have had! Talk about toppings!! You need a knife and fork to eat the deluxe!   Have never been in the restaurant or tried anything other than pizza, but the pizza deserves 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I always find this place hit or miss some time the service is good sometimes it's not.  I will say that the pizza is good but I don't think I have ever had something not good here."}
{"text":"Beckham's... oh Beckham's. Why did you have to fall down last night, of all nights? I love your pizza, especially your special for teams... $8 for a small pizza with any 3 toppings I want. I've had it before and it was a-ok. But last night after my frisbee game, I wasn't feeling the pizza. So I ordered a quesadilla instead.  It's my own personal policy never to write a one-star review as soon as I get home. It's a big deal, giving any place a one-star. Most times, it's more emotion than anything that fuels the need to vent and rant about an experience. And so, I have a next day policy. That gives me time to reflect and to be somewhat objective about the experience.  Well, it's the next day and I've reflected. There's no way to redeem last night's visit from receiving the title of my first ever one-star review. Four of us showed up around 830. The place was busy, but not packed. There were at least three servers on for the night. It's not uncommon for Beckham's to be busy on a Tuesday, they are surrounded by parks and fields after all, and always have oodles of sports team coming in and out the door. The first part of our visit was a-ok. Beckham's was sitting at a solid 3 star. Our server came right over and got our drink orders, she was quick to come back for our food orders. After that, she got a little harder to track down, but she was still around.  A fifth member of our team arrived about twenty minutes after us. He flagged down the server, ordered himself a beer and a pizza. By about 915, his pizza came out. Where were the quesadilla and wings the rest of us ordered? No where in sight. Team member thankfully shared a slice. 930, server is flagged down and told we didn't get the rest of our order. She was surprised the pizza had come out and not our other two orders. She also said that this had happened with 6 other orders that night already. She promised to head back to the kitchen and check on them and asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks. We declined. At 945, she came back to tell us our food got stuck behind a really large order. She offered to get the kitchen to pack it up to go. Instead, we cancelled the two orders, paid what we owed for our drinks and left.  Now, I understand that sometimes things get busy. And that people come in with other large groups of people and sometimes food doesn't come out right away. BUT... nearly an hour and a half to wait for 10 wings and one quesadilla is a wee bit ridiculous. Our server should've been on top of that, and if it was the 6th time this had happened that evening, where was the manager? You'd think he or she would have been over to the table at least once.  In no way does this seem to have been one person's mistake. Instead, an epic fail on the part of the team working last night. Beckham's, there's no excuse for last night. I won't be returning after this, but I do sincerely hope you learn from this review and find ways to not let other Calgarians go through a similar experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza's, with a lot of toppings and nice crispy crust. I had a meat pizza and it had a good variety of meats on it, and they didn't skimp on the amount. My wife had the cheese pizza with additional toppings.  I usually always finish my pizza but was I glad I didn't as it was excellent cold the next day. Our waitress was awesome, young and always smiled"}
