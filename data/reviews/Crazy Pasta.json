{"text":"This is a great place for a well priced Italian feast. Portions are big the food is tasty and the atmosphere welcoming. The owner Carl spends a lot of time at the restaurent ensuring a great experience for everyone. The first priority is always your satisfaction. Not to mentioned a huge selection of take home fresh pasta and sauces for your enjoyment even when you are unable to come to the restaurent or want to impress your guests."}
{"text":"Awesome prices/place. It's a shame it's so empty! People need to come here. The pancake is huge and only $4, and the skillets are only $12 which is way competitive for a brunch place!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent (even though under seasoned) but for the price, I can list numerous other local establishments that are darn good and a far better value. I won't be back."}
