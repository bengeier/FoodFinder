{"text":"Sadly, they are now closed.  Went there last night, but the window signage had been removed (including the open sign), the lights appeared to be off, there was a For Lease sign in the window and their website no longer appears to be operational."}
{"text":"Went last night to try the Mozart burger...nommm. Crisp veggies, delicious homemade sauce, juicy patty. The price is good for the portion. The owner cares so much about the place. Maybe should've thought out the decor a little better, and kinda wish they had a menu that doesn't look like it was put together by Microsoft publisher, but it doesn't distract too much from their delicious burgers!"}
{"text":"Came here after work one evening to try it out. We ordered the 99 Burger and Beat Burger with fries. The food was good but nothing mind blowing like what the earlier Yelp reviews had alluded to. It's comparable to a regular pub style burger."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place on Reddit Toronto; I decided it would be fun to trek down and try the new burger joint in town despite the ongoing blizzard.  Since the place is new; I'll be a bit more thorough on the review.  I was greeted by a very polite woman who I would believe to be the owner. Her English may not be perfect but even I can tell she has passion in her eyes. I ordered the Mozart Burger with no onions to go. While I waited, I took a look around the interior and the shop front.   The signage in the shop front I feel needs to stand out more; the logo looks great but I don't feel it's very visible as it seems like a waste for such a long signboard. It just has a small logo in the dead centre with plenty of space on the left and right side.   The interior itself could use some work decoration wise but I get the feeling it's not sure what it wants to look like yet so that is kinda negligible for now. The place was relatively clean and spacious too.   As for the food itself; it didn't take long, probably a bit less than 10 minutes which is fine for burger joints. The burger was better than I anticipated; the beef was as close to what I like as it can be without me making the burger itself. The sauce was great and the cheddar was spot on. I do feel like the other toppings like lettuce, tomato and pickles could have been utilized more though as I ate the burger without even noticing the taste of tomato. Overall, a decent burger for a decent price.   This is one to watch and definitely worth a try. If I have the time I'll probably return."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight to take out some burgers after reading the great reviews, and I have to say I'm totally in love with this place now. Everything was exceptionally delicious and fresh tasting, and the house made sauces were a wonderful touch! The rings and fries weren't afterthoughts either...not too salty or greasy, crispy goodness. No longer do we have to trek all the way down to P&L Burger or Burger's Priest to get our burger fix. The staff were so nice too, and very friendly. Love it."}
{"text":"Our burgers were really beefy and flavourful, but perhaps a tad overdone.  We did get takeout, though, so it's possible that the burgers just kept cooking on the way home.  Overall, really good banquet style burgers."}
{"text":"Didn't realise this was a new establishment.. went a couple days ago to check it out and it was superb.. mouthwatering burgers!! got the '99' burger.. will be stopping by again real soon!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am not a burger girl. I'm not one of these people who freaks out every time a new burger joint happens. In fact, I couldn't even tell you the last time I had a burger. However, I was somewhat craving one so I decided to accompany my burger-loving boyfriend on a mission to check out our neighbourhood's new burger place--you know, just to see what it was like.  Inside, its diner style reminds me a bit of a roller skating rink as a single disco ball rotates in the middle of the restaurant while subtle colourful lights flash around. I couldn't resist the charm of this place and upon seeing a family enjoying burgers in old fashioned presentation, I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Mozart burger--a 4oz cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles and bass sauce, which is kind of like a garlicy, rosemary-esque mayo concoction. I confess, i actually liked it a lot. Picture a Wendy's burger all grown up. Fresh, soft sesame buns surround a homemade freshly-ground patty. We also tried the super greasy onion rings and the fries, which were both alright though cold by the time we got home, yet still wonderful for soothing our hungover bodies. The boyfriend said it wasn't quite as good as the Priest, but would still totally go back. I probably will too.  One thing to note: Not that I'm a big bacon person, but I was kind of weirded out that they specified beef bacon. Maybe it's just me, but nothing about that sounds appealing. Other than that, it's great to have an awesome burger joint in the neighbourhood. I think I might bring my parents here next time they visit. Quick service, ample seating, and burgers are cooked to order."}
{"text":"Gord and I had a late lunch today at Burger Bass.  They just opened a couple weeks ago in our 'hood.  Gord ordered a 99 Burger with no tomatoes.  I ordered a Bach Burger with no onions or lettuce.  While we both agreed that the interior could use some work, we did enjoy the burgers.  The burgers are made with 100%, fresh beef that they grind fresh everyday and are topped with fresh toppings.  The bun was lightly toasted (so a bit crusty) but soft.  The meat was very juicy (make sure you have lot of napkins) and flavourful.  The bass sauce includes mustard, mayo, garlic and cumin and is tasty.  The staff was friendly and chatty.  I'll be back again for a burger!"}
{"text":"I'm not going easy on this place just because it's new. While I can appreciate the hard work that goes into opening a restaurant, I have standards!  When we walked in we were greeted with hip hop at a good volume and smiling staff (including, I assume, the Mother). Very nice! The space is huge and I think they could do a lot more with it. As it is now, the sparsely furnished place gives off a sad vibe. They should really put in some booths to fill up the space and add to the diner vibe! The washrooms are good, I love self contained washrooms.  Our burgers - 99 burger and Mozart - were delicious and juicy. There were some unique spices used, I think cumin? I thought the fluffy bun was a bit too big for my 4 oz burger, but looked like a good size for the bigger ones. On a prep note, they might want to cut the ribs out of the lettuce. The fries were close to perfect except that they were overly salted. The garlic sauce that came with the fries was very, very yummy. All in all very good portions. I loved the metal tray the food came out on, it was a nice touch.  We only noticed the small ice cream display on the way out. It'd be really awesome if they offered floats or milkshakes, especially in the hotter months."}
