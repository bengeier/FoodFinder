{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for dinner last night and didn't realize how close this place is to Greensburg! It is a perfect location for the Greensburg/North Huntington and west Newton diners. To start off, there is plenty of parking and easy to find in herminie. As soon as we walked in the owners, Rob and Lisa greeted us with a smile and hugs. They were thrilled as people started filing in for dinner. Every body that walked in the door was like royalty to them. We both ordered beers and they came out in seconds notice and they were as cold as you can get beer before it freezes. Nicely done.  We had a tough time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked so good. For appetizers we got the bacon wrapped dates.. which are probably the tastiest thing i have ever tried. and the cheese sticks were right up there fried to perfection... for dinner I got a barbecue loaded burger with onion rings jalapeños and sauce....amazing. and kudos to rob for using sliced grape tomatoes. My girlfriend got the po boy sandwich which she enjoyed thoroughly. And she is a little picky with food. All in all the service was 5 star. The atmosphere was so cozy and unique. And the food is out of this world. All at a fair dining price. Everyone in this area needs to try zalas ....you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Been to Zala's numerous times. We have had the sandwiches, salads, typically order dinner and now tried Saturday brunch. Saturday brunch with Bloody Mary bar is great. By far our favorite place for dinner. Love trying the dinner specials and they continually change them. The strip steak is always great. Seafood pasta, salmon, pork dinners are all favs. Drinks are good and very good beer selection. I always get a take home container as portions are large. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A small, crowded, hidden gem in Herminie PA; a nice diverse menu, good prices, great service and terrific food!  The specials are wonderful here - tonight we had the crab bake with andouille sausage and spicy hush puppies and the very well prepared and portioned french dip!  It is tight, but that is a part of its charm; skip the drive to the South Side, Lawrenceville or Shadyside and cruise into Herminie PA for a trendy and enjoyable dinner! We loved it here and will return soon!"}
{"text":"I parked by the side of the building and when I opened my truck door there was a wide wet river of something.  As I sniffed the air, I decided it must be leaking from the dumpster!  Went in anyway as I had arranged to meet a friend for dinner.  We both had a dish with crabmeat - mine was a regular menu item and her meal was a special.  Both of us ended up sick within a couple of hours after eating.  Definitely will NOT return to Zala's!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible! The service is absolutely perfect. You feel welcome the second you walk in the door. The beer on draft is ice cold. The food is literally to die for. The bacon wrapped dates(the appetizer)are absolutely amazing. I had the 1LB NY Strip. I am not even a huge steak person, and only get it at places I hear have a killer steak. Let me tell you, this steak was absolutely to die for. Garlic butter basted, seared medium rare to absolute perfection. The sides I picked were the garlic butter baked potatoes and the corn medley. The potatoes were awesome! But good lord was the corn medley incredible! Bacon, jalapeños, cilantro, and grilled corn all mixed together I can't get over how good it was as a side. I seriously can't get over how fantastic this unassuming little place in Herminie, PA is and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Based on previous reviews, decided to try this place tonight. Loved it! Great food, huge portions, great people. I ordered the white chicken chili and the fish tacos appetizer even though I was there for dinner. That is once I saw the size of the appetizer, overheard another booth exclaim disbelief that it was only an appetizer when served, I went with Jessica's recommendations. The fish was freshly breaded, light, the toppings slightly spicy which I love. Very tasty chili! My friend had the fish tacos, ate every bit and then the Pgh steak salad, half size. He ended up taking home half of his salad. Twice staff going past our table stopped to ask if I was dissatisfied with my choices since I did not finish everything. I explained it was wonderful, I simply could not eat it all. Also hard to decide what to order with so many creative items on the menu. We were warmly greeted by all on arrival and sincerely thanked for coming when we were leaving amid also just chatting with those working tonight. Rarely have I seen this type of warm caring attention, even from higher prices places! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Pretty neat cafe. Small but comfortable. Decent beer selection & the sangria was good. The wife & I both enjoyed the appetizer which was deep fried red peppers stuffed with cheese & covered with a red sauce. My dinner was good but my wife's chicken was over cooked & she's sorry she didn't say anything. The service was excellent. It was a little pricey for Herminie."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Zala's for the first time 2 nights ago.  It is a tiny friendly bar restaurant. The decor and atmosphere is so cool.   Very enjoyable.  The food was amazing.  I had French dip sandwich which was the best I've had.  My husband hand gnocchi with the sausage.  He loved it.  We keep talking about it and are ready to go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Excellent food and exceptional service. Four adults and one child and everybody was extremely happy with the food and portions."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying if I could give it 10 stars I would I have been hear about 10 times and every thing was great from the owners to the staff and they go out of their way to make sure every thing is right I am a pretty big guy and I have to take food home with me So you defiantly get what you pay for and more"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, large portions.. what's not to love?! It is making me write a longer review- but honestly, i feel that's unnecessary."}
{"text":"So good!  First time there today. Exceptional service (shout out to Jessica - so knowledgeable and friendly) and food. Nice beer selection, great Sangria.  We had the bacon wrapped dates sprinkled with blue cheese and a drizzle of honey...seriously tasty. I had the cast iron skillet steak with compound butter, green beans, parmesan potatoes, and an outrageous bread/cheese stick.  Steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and the sides were very good. Topo had the Smokehouse burger - also cooked perfect with just the right amount of heat.  This place is awesome and we will be back.  What a gem!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The bald bartender washed glasses while we sat at the bar waiting to order a drink. There were only 2 others at the bar. When another couple walked thru the door he couldn't wait on them fast enough.  We left after 5 minutes and will not go back.  That was the 2nd visit."}
{"text":"An absolute gem. Great food and good people. Amazing service! I go with family and friends and always greeted and welcomed."}
{"text":"Wow! A gem in Herminie!  Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. The menu looked great but got concerned when the dressing for my salad came in a plastic container but all concern faded after that.  My 16 oz. steak was perfect. It was medium rare as ordered and had a wonderful char from the cast iron skillet. The seafood bisque was above average and loaded with seafood. The side that surprised me and I really enjoyed was the two-tone corn with jalapeño. It was spicy and delicious.  My wife had the crab bucatini. She loved it. The sauce was light and refreshing. We had to bring both meals home for a late night snack as there was some much of it. I've had far more expensive steaks that weren't nearly as good. We made sure we told the very busy owner that we would be back."}
{"text":"This place is perfect, convenient location, after the first time we went (and LOVED the food!!!) we went back some weeks later and where thanked for coming back, very cozy, homey and comfy!!! And the food is absolutely delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! We really enjoyed the bacon pierogies, but it was all really good. Yummy garlic Parmesan fries and the Rueben was outstanding. The reviews did not disappoint us. We would definitely stop here again on our way to Pittsburgh. Super service.  My boys say they need more stars. Easy to get to from interstates."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had their special which was a steak sandwich with sausage, pepperoni, and peppers. Everything was excellent and the fries were seasoned extremely well. Service was friendly and the owner even let us try his homemade hot sauce. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!! Completely unexpected for the area. We have been here 4 times now and have yet to order anything that was less than outstanding. Had a burger the first visit when the menu was limited. It was one of the best burgers around. Now that there are dinners on the menu there is so much to choose from we have to go back every week!  Crab cake and the chicken in the port wine reduction are to die for. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  Huge portions   Is a nice comfy homey neighborhood place. Kitchen is open and owners greeted us warmly on arrival.   Would go again"}
{"text":"Crazy to find such great food in little Hermanie.  Ordered the short ribs and they were really tasty.  Great find!"}
{"text":"I tried a bite of everyone's plate in my group. Everything was so delicious. Crab cakes are awesome! Sides are delicious. Cheese filled breadsticks! Yum! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Rob and Lisa are what makes this place a joy, the food and service, over the top. Zala's is perfect,"}
{"text":"The service and food at this restaurant is absolutely impeccable. Our server, Bria, was amazing. I ordered the New York Strip Steak and it was easily one of the most delicious steaks I have ever had. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have had in a long time. Unique menu and excellent portions. It's in a small town in Herminie, you would never expect the flavors and creativity here. We had a variety of food and the cast iron steak was a table favorite. Excellent sauce too for the pasta. Truly one of the tastiest places around. Love this place. Can't wait to go back."}
