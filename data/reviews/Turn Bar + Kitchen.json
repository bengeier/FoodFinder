{"text":"We enjoyed an anniversary dinner in September. The food was divine, presentation was  perfect. The staff could not have been more accommodating."}
{"text":"I used to come here for Sunday brunch all the time when I lived in Cleveland. I had so much fun here. It's so nice and quiet here. I always ordered champagne, and I always ate a little too much chocolate from the dessert table. The eggs were good, the fruit was fresh and pretty, they had a nice variety of salads. I need to take my sister next time I'm back."}
{"text":"If you want to make yourself feel swanky and elite, Muse at The Ritz-Carlton is the lunch joint for you.  Not necessarily somewhere I would head on my own, but if you're with upper-management coworkers or want to make a good impression with clients, this is a great spot.  It's quiet, which allows for easy conversation; the food is fancy enough to match the atmosphere (it is at The Ritz-Carlton!); and the service is impeccable.    Each time I've visited Muse, I've ordered the cobb salad which is delish - in my opinion you can't go wrong with egg, avocado and bacon.  It's one of the few remaining restaurants that still serves bread  with your meal, so you can hobnob over sourdough and Parmesan crisps, too."}
{"text":"Arrived at the bar area around 9:30pm on a Saturday. There was one other couple there, while a few others trickled in... not busy at all. Unfortunately our food took at least half-an-hour from the time we placed our order...It actually may have been longer, but we chose not to stick around. Most of the staff was watching the Cavs game, so that may have been the cause of the delay. Not the type service I would expect, which is too bad."}
{"text":"Disappointingly disappointing. Wearing a suit and looking for an upscale place for a drink and a light meal after a day of client meetings, the recently renovated Turn bar at the Ritz Carlton seemed like just the place. The food was really quite good, but the bar staff was so indifferent and inattentive, the experience fell far below expectations. Ritz Carlton boasts of it's legendary staff training - weeks-long orientation to their mission of guest service and so on. Perhaps the staff at Turn missed these sessions?"}
{"text":"Stayed at ritz, ate at Turn for dinner.   It was a Saturday so there was a DJ, music was loud but we enjoyed it.  Server was super, bread and oil was really great, ice tea was fresh, corned beef sandwich was really great.  Overall nice, and now the not nice.   Fried cheese rolled in pretzel crust was good,  shrimp scampi was a sad bowl of melted butter and super thin sticky pasta with 5 shrimp and what looked like pickled red onions.  The shrimp was incredible the rest wasn't edible.  The seat seemed broken, uncomfortable because the cushion sunk so far down the wood frame dug into my legs.   We returned later in the evening for a nightcap and sat at the bar.   I am under 5' so I was barely able to get in the seat at the bar.  2 of the worst drinks we have ever been served.  The turn and passion cosmo, murky dirty pinkish dishwatery looking liquid.  One in a rocks glass with a ice ball and the other in a martini glass. A $33 dollar disappointment.  They also did last call at 1:15am?    Not really worth the money,  if your staying at the Ritz-Carlton byob."}
{"text":"Wow. Filet with gnocchi & Brussels sprouts side with Bernaise sauce. So. Good. Please drool over my picture although it doesn't do it justice.  Service is excellent, ambience is quiet and relaxed."}
{"text":"Don't eat there for Thanksgiving. They just reheat prior cooked food. It was an awful dining experience and the service was horrible. The waiter completely forgot to bring our desserts, which we had to remind him about."}
{"text":"Mike and Stephani took me here for their Mother's Day brunch. I cannot tell you how excellent the service and food were. I was pleasantly pleased with the lobster bisque, all the seafood selections and fabulous desserts. It was also my son's birthday and they brought over a special dessert with a candle for him. As we were leaving they even made a bouquet of flowers for all the moms. I  highly recommend turnfor any occasion."}
{"text":"Wow!   I visited Muse for lunch and I was not disappointed!  I entered the restaurant and was greeted and seated, right away.  My server arrived immediately and filled my water glass with filtered water, leaving the bottle on the table, which I love, because I can fill my glass, at will. The server also place a basket of assorted rolls and flatbreads on the table....yummy!  I proceeded to order the Harvest Salad ($14), adding grilled chicken (+$4).  My salad arrived a short time later.  Large bed of fresh chopped kale, topped with juicy cranberries, clusters of candied pumpkin seeds, roasted apple chunks, shaved manchego cheese and warm grilled chicken.  This was probably the BEST salad that I've ever had, a tad expensive at $18, but worth every penny.  The serving was more than generous and the ingredients were plentiful.  I would absolutely order this salad again and again.   I am still dreaming about it......."}
{"text":"So this is really the lobby lounge, and they serve the room service menu. It took a while for us to be waited on. And the tables are kind of small. However, at the food was excellent. I had scallops, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. I also had brussel sprouts, they didn't appear grilled as much as steamed. They werent crispy, but the flavor was very good. The pancetta that came next with them was excellent. The wine pour was small. Although they have a nice selection of wines.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for dinner. But if you're in the hotel, it's a nice enough meal. Without having to leave the premises"}
{"text":"We had a party of four this Saturday night for a birthday dinner.  The service was flawless and the food was excellent, from the appetizers to the desserts. We recommend the waffle fries as well as the chicken liver appetizers--not what we would typically order, but recommended by our server and tasty.  Very good cocktails and solid, if short, wine list. We will be back.  Thank you for a great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast there as I stayed at the hotel (for a wedding.) The food was not bad at all. The service was ABOMINABLE! Worst I have had in some time. After being seated, we waited at least 15 minutes before we were offered coffee. Without a lot of work we would never have been served at all. Most of the time it seemed like there were no servers in a larger room at all. Understaffed and poorly trained.  I would never ever go back. The aggravation is not worth it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Muse more than I did. But the whole experience was rather disappointing.   I met my mother there for lunch and we were the only ones in the entire restaurant at about 12:30 in the middle of the week. It was unfortunate. We each had to pay $12 plus tip to park at the Ritz (which is not nearly as lovely inside as the Hyatt or Renaissance downtown) which I think is ridiculous. When your restaurant is empty at lunchtime in the middle of the week perhaps providing free or at least discounted parking may be a good plan.  The dining room itself was nothing worth noting, with generic decor and cheap looking art. It was also freezing, which was unfortunate.  The service was very good, which was nice.  I ordered the turkey ruben. It was the best turkey ruben I'd ever had. But it was certainly not worth $18. I mean really, it's a sandwich. My mother ordered the $16 salmon burger, which she said was very good, but again, way too pricy. Plus they charged for every addition, which seems a bit tacky.  While we expected it to be pricy since it's the Ritz, it was lacking that something special to make it seem worth it. I would encourage Muse to reconsider its prices, as well as the costly parking situation. Perhaps then the place wouldn't be so empty."}
{"text":"I went to Muse a few years ago for Restaurant Week. Had a great time and good meal. Since I hadn't been there in so long, we decided to make reservations for our pre-show dinner the other day. Upon arrival at the Ritz, we couldn't find the restaurant - where it had been before was now an empty, dark space. We soon found out that they combined both the lobby lounge and restaurant together. We had reservations, but there was not host/ess seating people so we just sat down at one of the few tables they had. There were no food menus at the table and no waiters/waitresses to be found so after a few minutes, we just left. What a bizarre and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"It did not get off to a great start, but since I've started writing this review at the beginning of my meal/breakfast, things did look up.   Waited about 5-10 minutes at the entrance of the restaurant - no benches to rest on while waiting for someone to notice me and seat me. There are chairs in the lobby all the way across the lobby and hallway, but then I'd never get seated because no one would ever know someone was waiting.   I asked if there was a reservation under [breakfast companion's name], and was told no. So I said I'd just sit first and wait (being 7 months pregnant makes sitting very attractive). Waitress grabs 2 menus and we walk in.   So I pass by a table laid out for 3 and I stop and ask if we can sit here because we are a party of three. The server was annoyed that I didn't say that in the first place because now she had to go back and get another menu. I didn't make a huge deal out of it, but thought her comment was unprofessional.   I asked for coffee and orange juice and as I was waiting at the table, I heard her, quite loudly, talking to the other waiter about what just happened. It wasn't like she was cussing me out or even bad mouthing me (although the tone was definitely not a nice one - more of a complaining/funny/annoying thing that happened at work today tone). She was talking in the \"back\" of the restaurant, past the double doors that led into the serving hallway. But because those doors were open, the entire dining room could hear her. Extremely unprofessional given that this was a restaurant often used for business breakfasts.   After leaving the hotel, and taking some time to cool down, I called to let the hotel know about the acoustics of the dining room and pass on the fact that the servers in the back hallway should be careful as to how loud they are when discussing the customers.   I know this might just sound petty to some of the readers out there, but I know that I would appreciate knowing if the dining room could hear me talking about the customers. If she wants to complain (and I do understand how the misunderstanding happened and felt marginally bad that she was inconvenienced to have to take the 10 steps back to get another menu) she is free to do so behind my back (just not in my coffee please). I just didn't appreciate the entire dining room (there were about 3 other tables) hearing her comments.   The food/breakfast was good. Coffee refills were prompt, and other than the indiscretion at the beginning (before my companions arrived, thankfully) there were no issues. The hotel did give me a call back to try and understand the situation and I tried to be as balanced as possible including the role I played in inconveniencing her about the menu. Still, in a professional setting, I think that people need to be aware of their surroundings or the acoustics of their immediate area.   I appreciate the call back from the hotel manager and would probably be willing to eat at the Muse again and will definitely still stay at the ritz the next time I travel here)."}
{"text":"I usually stay away from hotel restaurants but because of scheduling ended up at the Muse and found it to be delightful. I had the citrus scallops and my guest had the Mahi Mahi. Both came perfectly prepared and perfectly presented. I certainly can't complain of the food and the service was likewise impeccable.   Muse also has a very complete wine list, which list was impressive even compared to that of other high end hotels. I also enjoyed the seating, as every chair is not only comfortable but has arms on them.  As for the bar area, it only has four bar stools; hence more display than functional.   Though Muse is perfect in ever detail, it has a sterile sort of hotel atmosphere about it. When dinning you just seem to be aware of the fact that it really isn't a restaurant as such but the convenience extension of something else; in this case a hotel.   Because it is a nice place with superb service, I gave it a three stars but as I can honestly say that I'm a fan of the place. However, if stuck in the Ritz hotel, pressured for time, I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Muse has a fantastic brunch buffet with a wide assortment ranging from sushi to custom scrambled eggs made in the middle of the room and brought to your table.  Fabulous service as you would expect from a Ritz. I also happened to show up on a game day and all the wait staff had  brown t shirts on to support their home town team that day. It was a fun unexpected home feeling you wouldn't expect to see in such a high end place.  If I'm ever in town again I would definitely come here again:) Great experience!"}
{"text":"Had such a lovely dinner with my husband last night. Everyone was so so kind to us and making sure all our needs were filled. I had the scallops and my husband had the chicken - we were both very happy with our dinners, delicious! Our waitress was so attentive and lovely, wonderful wonderful service. We would gladly go back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear about this restaurant being opened into the Ritz-Carlton in hopes to revitalize the hotel. In my personal opinion, they are on the right track.  The intimate and elegant decor is breathtaking and captivates all of the guests that walk through. For a Saturday night, there was quite the mixture of guests and locals dancing to the DJ's music.  The full service bar serves several options for appetizers, entrees and other aspects of your typical menu. I selected the salmon, which was cooked to my liking, but the pricing was not. I understand that this is an upscale hotel, but let's be real, paying more than 30 dollars for a small filet of salmon, complimented with only asparagus, is a bit ridiculous. I am more than happy to pay for quality, but this was not the case.  In addition to this, the wine selected was not impressive, and again, nor were the prices. I am a huge fan of the Vivino app, and seeing what they were chargin for a glass, compared to the market value of the bottle, was insulting.  Again, I understand that they are in the business to make money, but there comes a point to where you are being greedy.   Overall, this place is worth stopping by if you are in the neighborhood, but be prepared for a slightly pricier bill."}
{"text":"I came for martinis and had a lovely evening and terrific service.  The hostess was so pleasant and enjoyable to speak with.   It was everything that it should be."}
{"text":"Save your money, not worth it. When I hear the name Ritz Carlton I expect excellent food and service. My dad recommended Muse for a quiet romantic dinner. My husband made a reservation 1 month ago on open table.we arrived to find the restaurant no longer exists it is now Turn. Picture this: you are in the hotel lobby check in desk on left, bar on right , the restaurant is in the middle. Very noisy w loud rock music and TV at bar. Not quiet not romantic. Food was ok, but over priced bar food. The service was ok, the waitress kept apologizing, says she told the manager , but no one came to our table. They signed our valet ticket which got our parking decreased to $20. I was extremely disappointed. This is not the place for a romantic, special occasion : I recommend Pier W, Dons pomeroy House etc...."}
{"text":"Never EVER disappoints! I've come many times and have tried quite a few menu items. Food always comes out flawless and with an excellent atmosphere! I always sit with Mary, she will make the best recommendations and I just go with it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice, but the food tastes extremely average. We went there for thanksgiving and everything was worse than something we would eat at home. We had a nice time, and liked that we didn't have to cook; but paid 70 dollars per person for what looked and tasted like a 35 dollar dinner. On top of the average and uncreative dishes, my mom said her food was too salty and my salad had some bad pieces in it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had great service and great salmon. My guest had a perfectly cooked and flavorful filet. I liked every bit of the restaurant. It was very empty and by the time we left we were the only guests. That isn't a bad thing though; it was very peaceful in the dark paneled dining room with the fireplace going - the restaurant has the feel of an old school club and was quite relaxing. I'll note it isn't the place to watch TV however - there was a very small television added as an after thought in the upper left corner of the small bar."}
{"text":"Not terribly impressed.  I made a reservation for 3 on Open Table.  I got there, gave my name, and was seated.  First impression was ok. It's a nice space and they did a beautiful renovation.  However, I felt like diners were being people watched by the front desk staff because they are RIGHT THERE.  For some reason, my Open Table reservation was subsequently cancelled, which I didn't find out until checking my emails later.  100 points I missed out on and I'm not sure why.  There were only 2 other occupied tables and a handful of bored looking people at the bar.  So there shouldn't have been confusion.  Anywho, we ordered drinks, which were all pretty tasty.  For a shared app, we got the waffle fries. Definitely get those, they're good times.  As for entrees....yeah.  I ordered the Crab BLT and regret it to this day. You know what bacon CAN'T make better?  Alfalfa sprouts, that's what.  They were just stringy and gross.  My two girlfriends ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the Scallops. Both had to be sent back to the kitchen for being too cold.  Our waitress was sweet, but she continued to disappear.  I'm unsure if it was her or the kitchen.  What I do know is that they took the plates, microwaved them (or whatever they do) and sent them back out.  That's a terrible thing to do to delicate seafood like shrimp and scallops.  Thankfully, they weren't terribly affected.  The scallops came with \"Ohio City Pasta\" which turned out to be ravioli.  Strange choice.  Best thing about the meal was the dessert.  Cassata cake and it was pretty tasty.  No Baraonas, but it will do.  If you're a drinker, get the Triple.  That was so darn good, I had to take a picture of the menu!   All in all, it's overpriced and service was lacking.  Lovely space, but valet parking was hella expensive even with validation. It was a Thursday and I paid $20!  Can't say that I'll be back."}
