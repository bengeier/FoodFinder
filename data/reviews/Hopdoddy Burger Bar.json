{"text":"Incredible food at a great price point. The only thing I found strange was the ordering and service aspect, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have it set up the way that it is. You order at the counter, get your own drinks unless you order alcoholic drinks, and get your own condiments and napkins. Why do I need a server, and why would I tip that person? Anyway, the food, drinks and ambiance are great. If they were to change the service format, I would give them 5 stars. Check this place out."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. Great set up and very friendly. My jalape√±o BBQ burger was very good and the salted caramel milkshake was excellent. The truffle fries were much better than I had read in reviews - in fact some of the best I have enjoyed. 

We look forward to going back and trying some other items."}
{"text":"If you like a meatloaf burger then this is the place for you, but not for me. 

Its kinda pricey for what you get. 

As far as flavor and taste nothing to rave about. 
Service was ok also nothing to rave about. 

So what are you to expect ? 

A burger packed so dense its like a brick meatloaf. Above average cost, with average Taste, Flavor, and Service.

Bottom line is you can do much better for the buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"The shroom burger was great. Fries great. Chocolate stout shake definitely not chocolate, more like a a horchata shake. Great selection of beers and sodas. But man, it is the land of confusion trying to just get to your table. Let us seat ourselves Mr. Hopdoddy. What happens if you're meeting a group? Do you have to arrange to get there at the same time so you can go through the line together? Too much stress when I'm just looking to dip some fries in that tasty chipotle ketch. I love this place but dear lord, such a ridiculous ordering/seating process. I felt like I was at an airport that played cool music. All that being said, I'll probably eat here 100 more times because the food was great and I dig on anxiety."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!! The Nutella Pretzel shake is amazing!! A must try! The mushroom burger is by far my favorite but everything I have tried which includes the bison and tuna burger were great also! Very clean and dog friendly outside with water dish!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and I liked the seating/ordering system. I could grab a drink at the bar while the line moved along at a good pace - we got in the line with about 15 people in front of us and were ordering in about 7 or 8 mins. The mushroom burger was fantastic. I also really enjoyed the fries. I wasn't a huge fan of the milkshake however $6 for some ice cream, milk and a few crushed thin-mint cookies...? I won't order a dessert there again but will definitely be back for the burgers and fries. 
I don't want to be a jerk about the it but the wait stuff was on the dumpy side ... I get that you're not that attractive but it wouldn't kill you to try at least a little."}
{"text":"Really impressed. This was our first time. I had the primetime burger and my wife had the magic shroom. Both were excellent. The red velvet cake shake really hit the spot. Probably the best I have ever had in that flavor! Upgrade to the truffle fries and you won't be disappointed. Very attentive service. Our friends, too, were pleased with their experience."}
{"text":"Was the worst food I ever ate in my life. Service was no better. Greasy and gross. I would rather eat Jack in the box!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but good desserts. Like I said, there is decent food, but expect a good wait. Last time I was there, there was a 15-20 minute wait."}
{"text":"I got the Buffalo Bill. It was a bison patty with bacon and Frank's red hot sauce. It was great! The burger was cooked perfectly! I mean, I don't know how bison is usually made but it tasted great so I'm assuming it was cooked well. It was spicy and savory! I strongly recommend it. 

I also got some of the Parnassian truffle fries. They were really good but I wouldn't recommend eating a while order by yourself. They are full of flavor and it can be easy to go a little over board with them. But the regular fries were equally delicious! Very brown and very crispy just like I like them! 

I thought I might as well try a shake while I'm here and boy am I glad I did! I got the pretzel and Nutella shake by recommendation of our server. She did not let me down at all! The shake was pretty thin and easy to drink and was topped off with pretzel chunks. Needless to say it was amazing!!! 

Only gripe was that when I walked in I was really unsure of what to do. Took me a few minutes to figure out that I needed to order at the counter. But now I know :)"}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner and cocktails. Hop Doddy never disappoints. Had a great server taking care of us making sure we had any and everything we needed. Sat there for almost 4 hours catching up and never felt like they were trying to rush us out."}
{"text":"Good burger, delicious, fresh fries. Be patient, order process a little drawn out for a burger place, but if your not in a hurry, worth the wait. Try the stout chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!!! Great tasting burgers! Fresh! The truffle fries are great too!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints around. The Buffalo Bill is my favorite. The staff is extremely friendly and their ginger lemonade is the best. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just moved to Arizona and have been trying out lots of of new restaurants. Finally a place with great service and great food.  The staff was fast and friendly but not too fussy. I had the ahi tuna burger and it was cooked perfectly, you could tell everything was really fresh and made with care. My husband had a burger and we thought it was way better then shake shack which is our usual go to spot. He is also  a huge beer guy and so he loved their beer selection. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic burger options that are far more unique and authentic than a typical burger joint. The server recommend parmesan fries and a side of queso dip. That really hit the spot and I would strongly recommend the same. The best part of Hopdoddy is they source all ingredients locally all the way down to Papago beer options on draft. I'm excited about our next visit to Hopdoddy."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour.  Great, cold craft beers, served in a frozen glass, burger specials for $5.00, it doesn't get much better.  Beers and Burgers are top notch.  Sitting at the bar makes ordering easy, your bartender put the orders in and you are done."}
{"text":"I am very hopeful for this place but unfortunately I have to give 3 stars based on my visit tonight. My first visit was 5+ stars best burger ever. Tonight was more like 2.5. 

They warned us in advance that the burger is cooked medium rare which is exactly how we like. When it came out all 4 of our burgers were fully well done without the jalepenos and some of the amazing flavor from our first visit. Long story short it was inconsistent, leaving us still craving that first amazing burger experience.

I will say the service is great, so is the atmosphere and concept. 

We are going to give it another chance because we LOVED our first visit so much. Please cook it medium rare next time! :-) it's a burger joint, and that's pretty important."}
{"text":"It's okay, the drink selection is odd but the ambience is relaxing. The burgers are fine but nothing great, I'll say a bit overpriced and only a la carte for fries and sides."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here.  Although I would say it is easiest to just hope into a set at the bar and get full service then going through the line.  Their Sea Salt Caramel milkshake is yummy.  I finished it before I even got my burger.  I got a veggie burger with a gluten free bun.  I felt like giving it a shot even though I love me some beef.  It was delicious although the gluten free bun was a little flimsy.
My husband got their mushroom swiss burger and fries which he polished off with no problem.  He would go back anytime and that is saying a lot.  He has high burger standards.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Went at an off time and was told by friends it is usually much busier.  Had a burger, fries, and chocolate shake.  Really pretty good.  The burger was good, but not great.  Very tasty but not the best I ever had.  The fries were real good for what they are (I prefer different, but they were good for how they were), the shake was great!  Service was spot on, though it was not busy.  I would go again but not drive a long way to get there."}
{"text":"Fantastic juicy burger cooked to perfection. Order a beer and it is served in the coldest goblet you've ever seen. Can't wait to go back again. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Good call for a Sunday afternoon. Burger is fresh and staff is friendly.  A little bit pricier burger but I think worth it.  My burger was 8 bucks. Beer is cold and atmosphere is mellow. We will come again. 
Diablo burger had a nice kick and the onions were cooked appropriately. Get the green chile cheese sauce with the fries."}
{"text":"Visiting in town so I looked this place up, though I didn't get to try the shakes but I ordered the El Diablo Burger, food quality was top notch, and they gave me chipotle ketchup with my fries. The giant goblets of beer are a reason alone to come, all the beers are local brews which can be hard to find. Staff was friendly and food arrived on time... Practically perfect"}
{"text":"This restaurant has very bad handicapped access so anyone who has trouble walkiing or is in a wheelchair will have a tough time getting to the entrance. Burgers are so greasy the lettuce looks like it came from a swamp."}
{"text":"so incredibly disappointed...read the reviews and thought it would be great...SKIP IT!  go anywhere else for a hamburger...the only thing good was the fries and the oreo milkshake. Could think of better places for a $40 lunch with my son."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink after a long day at work, and hands down the best restaurant experience I have had. Katie, the bartender, made my night! Not only did she make a killer mighty mule, but also brightened up my night along with Saul, one of the BOH employees that sat down after work to enjoy a burger alongside of me, both kept me engaged in happy conversation. If anything, I'll be back just to hang out with them again! Oh, and the burger was phenomenal, juicy and cooked to perfection on a home made, gluten free bun. As a seasoned restaurant employee myself, I commend this business on both service and food, mostly service. :)"}
{"text":"Just ok. Food was good, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. Lots of options and combinations, and they have gluten free buns and a veggie burger, so that was a plus. 

Fries are above average, and the small touches, like the condiments and the soda were very well done.

However: vastly overpriced for what you get, and the restaurant is that particularly annoying combination of counter-service and servers. Basically you place your order and it comes to your table, but I wouldn't really call that full service, even if they do in theory refill your drinks."}
{"text":"great bar - good beer selection

The milkshake is pricey but well, well worth it

Excellent range and selection of burgers

Awesome upscale atmosphere and a GREAT LOCATION

the line is long and at first the ordering system is a bit different but honestly any place with good food and great service is going to be busy. love the doddy!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger(s) I have ever had!!! I can honestly say I have had every burger on the menu and while the goodnight (which donates to charity) is my personal favorite, they are all amazing. I also recommend the truffle fries and milkshakes. Seasonal burgers and milkshakes spice up the menu, and evey body loves a full bar with local beers on tap. Even my vegetarian wife has had her favorite veggie burger experience at Hopdottys!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome fries with green Chile queso. Classic burger with carmelized onions and the Thunderbird (Chicken) burger is to die for. Great eats."}
{"text":"5 Stars across the board. Burgers were perfect and amazing milkshake! Friendly staff, fast service. 

If anything to critique, is the odd sized goblet the beer served in?? Just out of place..."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you do not like the cold breeze coming through near the door.  All seating is assigned by wait staff and if it is busy, you cannot switch.  Also, the people who take the orders don't listen very well.  Said no to cheese, got cheese.  said yes to chicken on my salad; came without.  Fries okay, burger mediocre.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Staff doesn't seem to be awake. Burger was saturated with grease, bottom bun soaking in grease. They didn't get my shake on the order and after reminding wait staff 3 times about it, I finally got the shake when I was about finished with my food. Tasted like they poured it out of a McDonald's machine. Asked them to take it off the bill, which took another 10 minutes to get out new bill. Frys were unseasoned.  We absolutely will not be giving this food joint a second chance."}
{"text":"First time I had gone to Hopdoddy so I went with the Continental. Probably the best turkey burger I've ever had and it actually looked like a burger ready for its photo shoot. The staff was very friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"My first time here and I thought the food was mediocre. The atmosphere is fun and casual and the staff are nice and friendly. 

I had the Magic Shroom burger and fries. I thought that the fries were bland and the burger, well...it was ok. What made it taste yummy was the pesto sauce. If it weren't for the pesto sauce, it probably would've been just average. 

Quite honestly, in my opinion, the burger joint across the street from them is just as good, if not better and less expensive (I won't mention names, but the name of this joint across the street has the sound of *sh at the end of its name)

I'm giving them 4 stars because I received good service, and I'm a stickler for excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I had most amazing burger that I have ever had, it was very juicy , really tender, and the flavor wore incredible, 
I will personally recommend it"}
{"text":"Our family has come to this place on multiple different occasions in the past.  We are always greeted right away at the door and handed a menu.  We appreciate consistency in the places that we frequent, so we knew that the next stage is to sit at the bar or get in line and order some food.  

They have a monthly burger choice that is always packed with variety and typically something that I would never think of combining on a burger.  Hopdoddy has a solid menu with great variety from chicken burgers to spring mix salad (you can add a black bean burger for some extra protein) for vegetarians.  Make it your own by adding, substituting or eliminating all together.  Finally, add some fries to the order and your all set.  

Hopdoddy also has some good beers on draft that come in an ice cold mug or if you prefer a mixed drink they have a solid variety to choose from.  

Overall, quality place and we will certainly come back and recommend this to friends!"}
{"text":"Really cool place to hang on a nice day. Patio seating. Burgers are amazing! Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews however what else can you do when multiple people walk in and order after you... and there food comes out first. Well that's exactly what happened to me and it is tremendously frustrating when there's more people working than patrons in the restaurant. Havent tasted the food yet... I'm sure it's a decent burger... just don't think I would return with horrible customer service. Oh yea... and when I asked the bartender where my food was, stating multiple people have walked in/ordered after me and they've already gotten their food... he replied \"oh well the fries take a while\". Seriously?!  Fries Seem like something very easy to cook up. Also, everyone else had ordered fries as well and were already eating theres before my food was ready. 1 star. So sad."}
{"text":"They seem to struggle during peak times. While standing in line to order a lady cut in front saying she just needed to get a to-go box as no servers would come to her table. 
We specified to hold the opinions on our burgers, but both arrived with onions. Our food was delivered cold to lukewarm, without utensils. I had to go up to the counter to ask for them and was told all we're in the dishwasher, and were brought later. No one came by to ask if we wanted refills on our drinks, and I had to flag a server down to get a to-go box for my cold food. He was the one who took our order so I mentioned we didn't want onions but got them, he said he would mention it to the kitchen. 
I will avoid going there during peak times, for what they charge, the service isn't with it."}
{"text":"Owen is an excellent server very personable, and knowledgable. Food was 5/5 el Diablo burger truffle frys, my wife had the turkey burger and loved it. Great scooner beers and margaritas, will definitely return. From Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Had the Magic Shrooms burger with Green Chile Queso with Fries while Tim had the Bacon Cheeseburger. My burger rocked; delicious; juicy; and very flavorful. Tim wasn't as impressed with his. He said the meat wasn't very flavorful. The Green Chili Queso Fries are awesome. Definitely recommend getting those if you go. And since we went during Happy Hour the price was just right."}
{"text":"Great burger,great fries, great sauces, great price. Bottom line is if you haven't been here then you should go hop in your car and get yourself a burger. Unique ordering Concept, but it works. Friendly service and food comes out very fast."}
{"text":"This place never fails to be amazing! Quality food and good beer. I've brought family and friends here and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"We are new to Scottsdale and found decent reviews for Hopdaddy. The name being a bit trendy had us thinking outside the box, I mean burger bar..sounds awesome, or so we thought. We shall go pro and cons to keep it simple. 

Cons: No initial greeting. Right as we walked in, not only did no one say anything, but there was no hostess stand. So, we figured self-seating. Once the waitress came over and said\" Oh you guys haven't been here before, so I guess its ok\" -- Oh sorry for being a new customer, my bad. She told us to head to the back of the restaurant and stand in line to place our order. You order, and pay, before you even sit down. Are we at McDonalds? 

Pro: Food came quickly. Usually we don't complain about \"too quickly\" but we wanted a nice, sit down meal...ya know time to enjoy your beverage, chat a few, enjoy the ambiance. Nope. Half way through our meal, the waitress comes back over and says.. \"can you hand me your number\" -- Really, while I'm in the middle of my meal, you want me to put down my food to hand you something..that is of NO relevance right now?? Ridiculous. Staff needs to be re-trained on customer care. 

Con: Paper towels as napkins. Not my style. I guess if you wanted to order anything else you have to stand back in line..and might just loose your table. The theory of out side the box, wasn't what we had hoped. And the food was OK at best, if your name has \"burger\" in it, please have a GOOD burger. The burger was dripping..soggy bun as soon as it hit the table, and was med-rare. (They didn't ask a preference but I think med-rare as an average is a bit questionable. 

Pro: Beer size for price was good. $6 for a premium draft. Everyone was drinking a milkshake, so those might be worth a try. And um...well, I guess they have a couple TV's, that's good. 

Overall, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"LOVE the food.  The prices are a little high, but usually worth it.  The unique soda selections are always a favorite too."}
{"text":"Going in for the first time is very good food! But then this was ultimately the most confusing food experience and restaurant concept in the entire world. Absolutely bizarre and confusing and made us feel super uneasy with so many employees walking around - so there's no point to give you a server or hostess or 90% of the decisions they made for it."}
{"text":"Place is on point! Burgers are awesome. Perfectly cooked to perfection. You have to try the truffle fries! There to die for. Great selection of beers and liquor too. Staff is very friendly and great on upsells! Place is definitely worth to check out if you're in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"Oh my YUM! Nutella shake! Buffalo Burger with Wings Sauce! Truffle Parmesan fries! Wow!"}
{"text":"I prefer eating at the bar so you don't have to wait in line for your food. I have been there 3 times so far and everything I have ordered is very fresh and full of flavor. The order of fries is enough to share. I have recommended the restaurant to many of our friends."}
{"text":"Good burgers and milkshakes! The fries were very good as well. It is slightly expensive, but it's nice to know that the beef is good quality!"}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre and at these expensive prices I just can't give a good review"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AWESOME!  Lots of great beer and drink selections. Price is good. and it's fast casual!  Nice outdoor seating too. Lots of TVs for sports.  And cool atmosphere. Got a burger, no bun (protein style) was just as delicious. Fries were excellent too. Will defitenly come back."}
{"text":"Wow! I have found my new favorite burger restaurant! It's been a while since I have loved every single thing I ordered at a restaurant.  We had never been here before and were a little thrown off by the \"order at the counter\" idea when the place looked like a typical restaurant.  We went to our booth to look over the menu and our waiter came over to tell us we could go ahead and just order with him whenever we were ready.  So apparently you can do it either way.  Throughout our meal, we had about 4 or 5 different people come and check on us (plus our waiter checked on us many times).  I thought this was nice because they seemed over-staffed and had a group of waitresses (or hostesses) hanging out at the front chatting but they kept breaking off one by one to go make rounds and check on customers all throughout the restaurant.  I highly recommend all of the following: Black Cherry Hard Limeade, Green Eggs & Ham Burger (special burger that I hope makes it on the permanent menu), Green Chili Queso, and Caramel & Sea Salt Shake.  Shockingly good prices for such amazing food, good atmosphere, and good customer service!"}
{"text":"\"Cerveza Rita\" - nuff said. This is our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere, great food, easy to get to location and friendly staff. LOVE the fresh meat they serve! I'm telling you, there's a difference between janky tyson meat and the fresh ground beef and bison they serve at this joint. Top notch!"}
{"text":"nah, bloody mary was no good, all about changing things up that was too much in my book.  Food was good, no ambiance, stuck between a cool neighbor bar and an In N Out. (I'll run to In and Out and 86 the blood-mary or play shuffle board at zipps)."}
{"text":"Very fun place with a really good burger! My wife had the primetime, which is a mix of high end beef and other fancy items like Brie and arugula. I had the llano poblano. I preferred my wife's burger, but mine was great also. We also had the Parmesan truffle fries, which I highly recommend. They also have a great local beer selection.

The only knock I have on this place is you have to pay up front, including tip (if paying with card). I don't feel totally comfortable tipping before services are rendered. Not that I would tip any differently, it just seems weird."}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour recently, and you truly can't beat the 5 dollar happy hour menu! Decent selection of cocktails and drafts. 

I did not get to try the burgers yet, but had a few orders of fries. The fries alone were pretty good! However, the green chili sauce was a tad on the bland side. 

All and all, great atmosphere, friendly staff. I will likely come back for another happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. The burgers are extremely tasty and the salads are really good. I was very confused at the soda machine though. You won't find any sodas you are familiar with but everything is made with real sugar and tastes really good. 

You walk in and somebody gives you a table number so you know you will have a table if it is really busy. However you end up ordering at the counter. I am confused by the fact that a server walks around and says they will help you, because my experience is that they basically introduce themselves and then that's it. I end up getting my own drink refills, etc."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place has gotten so many stars. Its a weird setup. First, you go in, and stand in line (McDonalds style) to order a burger and drinks. Wait staff are shuffling next to you and jostling to get by. You're standing in line being jostled on one side and have a loud kitchen in the other.  You pay for your food. You sit and wait. The burgers weren't great. The meat was gummy and had the feel of biting into some gelatinous gooey meat like substance. Not a burger. The hubs had a super salty veggie burger and my kid had a grilled cheese that was basically a hamburger bun turned inside out and buttered within an inch if it's life and pan fried. It was greasy and gross and she smeared buttery handprints on every surface she could touch (She's two - she can't help it. I cleaned up before we left with a wipe, but even for a toddler, it was a gross amount of grease.) The saving grace of the meal was the truffle fries, but I'm kind of partial to truffle oil and can eat that with a spoon, so maybe I'm not a good judge. We ordered a shake to round out our meal and had to pull out our credit card a second time during the meal to pay for it. (WHY don't they just have you order all your food at the table like a normal restaurant so you don't have the hassle of paying multiple times for one meal? I mean, you have the wait staff... They did take an order at my table...) It's a stupid setup. The place is too loud. The food is below average (I like to only give one star to restaurants that ultimately give me the trots, and at least they didn't give me food poisoning). And it's not kid friendly. Save your money and go pick up some burgers at In N Out and rent a movie at home. The experience and the food would be far better. (Yes, I called a fast food burger better...) I would judge this place \"Not worth the calories and the drive.\""}
{"text":"This burger joint is legit the food is amazing the drinks are fabulous..service is good..the ordering process will catch you offguard but it works out in the end"}
{"text":"Went to Hopdoddy due to high praise from a friend. Very disappointed. We stood in line for about 20 minutes, plenty of time to read the justification for the system. Seemed sensible that they would not take your order until they have a table for you. When you think about it, isn't that the way all restaurants work? The difference is that you stand and wait rather than sit and wait. Our order was taken in due course and then we waited another 15 minutes to pay. The payment process was very slow with only 1 register open for a line that went out the door. Finally sat down to wait again. Fries came out quickly. Portion size was not even close to the size/quantity described. I'm agree with another reviewer and prefer to eat them with my burger. By the time the burgers came, they were luke warm at best. I sent mine back as it was inedible, meaning my friends had to watch me eat it by myself. Then, the huge bill for a burger served with a roll of paper towel and ketchup in little paper cups. Not even close to worth it."}
{"text":"The $10 (and above) burger is commonplace in brew pubs and concept restaurants these days.

That doesn't mean the burger should be 10 bucks or eaters should put up with 'em. HopDaddy is the latest, clearest example.

We went on a Wednesday night, right before the rush of diners. 

I ordered the prime time, the missus the s'hroom burger. I was told the PT is served medium rare and was asked if I'm OK with it. Great. What came out was a soggy, well-done burger -- did they keep the patty in a steamer, like some fast-food joint? -- that was flavorless.

The missus' burger was better but also overcooked.

The bun is just not right -- it's way too soft and weak -- for a burger.

The fries and beers are the best thing about our visit, although you have to wonder about $5 for a side of fries and $6 for draft beer served in a margarita glass (well short of a pint).

Lastly, and it's not a small point, the concept of HopDaddy seems like an afterthought. It's poorly thought out and executed: you ordered on your own, then once seated, get \"full wait service\"? The wait staff provides no insight or service, save asking whether we needed anything else with our naked fries (yes, ketchup is upon request and served in small paper thimbles, just like McDonald's) and bringing the check.

One might drop in for a brew if shopping in the area. Else there are many more options for a better burger experience."}
{"text":"This place could be 5 stars for the food & friendly staff, but it gets only 4 stars for the Rube-Goldberg-esque system that they have for queuing in line to place your order & to be seated (so many kids guiding you in what looks like a straight line to the register). Their french fries are fantastic (order them with green chile queso), their burgers are delicious, & they make a delightful milkshake in a dozen different flavors. Be sure to look at the specials, since you may not have a traditional \"waiter\" especially if you are seated at the bar (which works great and saves time, I'm not complaining about it)."}
{"text":"Another great find through yelp. My husband and i went here for dinner on a week night.
Interesting concept to order, wait in line, place order, get a table and they bring you the food. Overall good food, great drinks, lively environment and friendly staff. Everything was great for the most part, I had ordered the veggie burger which was falling appart, but the taste made up for it. Eat the patty with a fork and carry on right...We also got the turkey burger, truffle fries which were gone within few minutes. The best part of the dinner was the Nuttela pretzel milk shake !! Go get one, i promise you will love it !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great burgers and great beer! The burgers are unique and delicious! I love the fact that they use local farms and local brewery's! I would highly recommend this place. I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now & have had very different experiences. The first time here, we ate inside, had fantastic service & left very satisfied. The second time, we ate outside and we were definitely forgotten about. The busser probably helped us more than our server. So it's really hard to say what kind of service here is the norm. 

A couple of things we noticed both times we ate there: 1) there is not a lot of difference between a small and large size fries, but they charge twice as much for the large. If we're paying twice as much, shouldn't we be getting twice as many fries? I guess not. 2) the shakes are delicious. 3) I consider the burgers here to be \"pretty good\", but not excellent. For the price, I'll take Shake Shack or The Stand."}
{"text":"My second time back and I want more of it...!!!!   Great burgers. ...live the fries and the whole pkg....great concept. ..look totally cool ... great drink specials...very Groove. ... !!! It's a big WIN ...!!! THEY SUPPORT LOCAL FARMERS..!!!! :))))))"}
{"text":"The food was good. But the worst service that I have ever had. Our waiter Chad (if you ever get Chad as a waiter ask for a different server) was beyond horrible. He was under the influence of something, he could not stand straight and keep wobbling. He took our drinks for refills and never returned, we had to get new drinks from the manager. He finally returned about 30-mins later with check and then when we paid he lost our card. We had to wait another 20-mins while he checked his pcokets and tried to remember where he had let our card. Good food but horrible service."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour prices on Burgers.  The food is good.  The service is trying to be too clever though. We have been there several times.  There may or may not be someone at the front to greet you when you walk in.  Sometimes you are given a table number, other times we have chosen our seat.  After ordering, it's unclear if it's full service or not.  A waiter or waitress may get you condiments but you can also just get your own.  It's a sort've confusing spot between full service and self service.    The food itself is pretty good though."}
{"text":"Magic Shroom burger is unbelievably juicy and so good!  Best burger I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite burger joint. Everything about it was perfect. Great beer, great burgers with fresh ingredients.  Everything is hand crafted all natural and local. 

Even the beer is local. How much better could it get. You don't drink beer, grab an all natural soda with real cane syrup that tastes great as well. These guys have it down."}
{"text":"I had the Magic Shroom Burger and it was great! The servers were all smiling and you could really tell that they enjoy working here. I loved the atmosphere and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great beer selection.  I had the Goodnight/Good Cause burger which was awesome, and 1.00 went towards a charity so I was eating like a pig for a good reason. 

The beer choices on tap were outstanding. The only thing holding this place back from 5 stars were the truffle fries. I know truffle fries and these were most definitely not truffle fries.  They were fresh cut and tasty, but don't tell me they will have truffle flavor and then don't deliver the truffle flavor."}
{"text":"Management needs to purchase meat thermometers. 3 separate occasions we've been served raw meat. raw....yes, raw.  I enjoy my burger more on undercooked side, but raw is different than med-rare.  And no, I'm not culinary challenged and fully understand the various meat temps. 

when the burgers are cooked appropriately, they're very good.  Great fresh bun.  Fries are solid.  I will give management props for personally addressing food issues.   

 management, please take this review to heart.  After reading other yelp reviews, this is a common complaint. Get your act together, it's gross and dangerous."}
{"text":"Buffalo bill was the best burger I've had. The bison was cooked perfectly, with a thin line of red, keeping it juicy throughout. The bacon, cheese, and bed of greens (romaine lettuce, maybe some arugula?) just rounded it out to make an awesome burger."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident while on vacation.  It was GREAT! Clean, super friendly and competent employees.  I had the classic burger with a bison patty instead of beef.  Fabulous--served with leaf lettue, onion and a big slice of beefsteak tomato.. Husband had the Buffalo Bill--bison with bacon, onion, cheese, special sauces, leaf lettuce, beefstak tomato.  He loved it. They bake their own bread and the buns were soft and perfect.  Also tried the truffle fries--you get a huge amount, more than enough for two people to share.  Yum!  They have an ahiu burger too. The place was super clean, easy to get to, and they use locally sourced foods, and grind their own meat, Get the Root Beer to drink.  It's the old fashioned kind and is wonderful.  Worth the price. We'll be going back before our vacation is over."}
{"text":"Great place, to start it has a modern/ obtuse fealing too it. Big crowds are expected late night/weekends.  Awsome place to grab custom/craft burgers. Regulars are noticed daily as employees are constantly builing a croud that feens to come back. I personally use the place as a happy hours/ after work place to grab a few beers. Put it into your plans, fit it in, make it happen you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Almost left when they advised that we have to order immediately upon entering. Than Justin saved us and Provided a woNderful experience and the food was fantastic. Thank you Justin. We would come back if we could sit in your area again. Lots of other servers there just standing in clusters talking to each other. Why so many in a serve yourself restaurant anyway?"}
{"text":"My Buffalo Bill burger was simple and delicious. The truffle fries were crisped properly and the variety of sauces helped enjoy the meal more. Had a good time eating at this place"}
{"text":"Read  comments so we knew what to expect in terms of ordering but still a little disorienting trying to figure it out for the first time.  Staff were very helpful.  Had the Thunderbird (chicken burger) and the basic burger and both were delicious.  Also had the chocolate shake and frozen margarita.  Cost was very reasonable.  We enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"It's a less good 5 guys with some hassle mixed in. Lots of creative sounding ingredients, no actual flavor. Truffle fries were pretty good though."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life! I went to Hopdoddy after a meeting. The line was long. Oh, no! But it moved pretty quickly. My friend and I chose the Shroom Burger with additions and deletions to suit our tastes. Usually I'll eat half of something that big. Not this time! I ate the whole thing and nearly licked the plate! Also, they have sodas by a company I've never heard of. We tried a couple and they were good. We settled on the Root Beer. All in all, great meal in a place with a cool vibe. Will return - quickly!"}
{"text":"Kristin is the bomb dot com and so is the thunderbird. I recommend always asking for a side of sassy."}
{"text":"Although the staff is nice when asked to attend to you, their service is chaotic and mediocre at best.  They are slow, they mix up orders, they forget to bring what you had asked for.  We tried them twice in one week, and both times they were running around trying to figure out what order goes to what table. They also will bring you burgers that are still look medium, especially when you clearly point out to them that you want \"no pink\" when ordering.  All our burgers came out with variations of pink   To add insult to injury, on our second visit (9/1/16) my son had the Greek burger (lamb) and got food poisoning.  Although management has been very responsive so far, I truly believe the staff's negligence spill beyond the serving floor and into the back kitchen.  I'm very disappointed to say the least, with my child have had to miss school, his swim meet, keep him and my and my wife up most of the night to attend to his abdominal cramps, vomiting and numerous toilet visits, not to mention ruining our weekend trip that had been set from several months back.  I will not go back until I get a full investigative report from the health department, giving these guys the scrutiny they deserve to get their stuff together.  As a restaurateur, a clean kitchen with knowledgeable staff is one of the key ingredients to keep happy customers while serving healthy food.  These guys have failed at both quite miserably."}
{"text":"Love this place. its just not your normal Burger Joint. I had the Magic Shroom Burger along with the Truffle Fries; yum yum!! Never disappointed..."}
{"text":"After my second trip to hopdoddy I figured I'd do a review. The process of ordering is designed to get you to spend more money and receive less service and time to enjoy your dining experience. They count on most people ordering a drink at the walking bar thats your first bill. When you finally make it to the register to order your food they give you a table number and your hit with your second bill. If you'd like another drink be ready to get your wallet out for the third time. So to me they figured out how to get you to take out your billfold over and over and over again. Makes sense for the business owner as they now have several opportunities to get you to spend more money. But the customer and server are the ones on the short end of the stick. Half of you're dining experience is spent standing around being shuffled down the line with your five pound mug waiting to get your next bill. Most people tip on service which is almost nonexistent so the servers get crappy tips. The food was ok but we ordered are burger well-done both times as my wife is pregnant and cannot consume rare meat and each time they were served to us medium rare. Which brings me back to the service or lack of. No one came to check with us for about 20 minutes by then we were out the door never to return. Hey Mr. HopDoddy Your ass backwards ordering system my seem good for your bottom line but everyone in my party left pissed-off and you will lose your customer base..."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers with delicious gluten free bun! You can also buy a pack of house made gluten free buns!! Cool!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't need any more reviews to reveal how delicious it is. I just need to crown it BEST TURKEY BURGER IN TOWN!!! None of the other gourmet burger restaurants have comparable turkey burgers... and I've tried a lot! They're always consistent and awesome, doesn't matter which burger you substitute turkey for, all good!"}
{"text":"The burgers are great, shakes are delicious... The truffle fries are Tid bits that required a fork, looked like they drained the fryer and gave us what was at the bottom. The service was HORRIBLE and servers need a lesson in Hospitality 101. Good luck in North Scottsdale Hopdoddy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The experience usually starts in line where the friendly staff greats you, offers you drinks, as well as answers any questions about the menu you may have so you are ready to order when you get to the counter. Their beers are served in giant frozen glass goblets that are awesome! Everything on the menu is amazing especially the truffle fries and milkshakes. Goodness gracious they know how to cook a fantastic burger!

Pro Tip: They don't make reservations, first come first serve, for the best experience keep your party small (4) because they will separate you when you party gets up there in size."}
{"text":"It's OK but not great.

The place looks nice and clean and it is.  Once you get inside you wait in a line to order your food. When you get to the front you order your food. On your credit card copy, there is a place for a tip and a reminder than normal tips are 15% , 20% and 25%.  If you didn't notice that, the staff has a handmade sign reminding you to tip.  Can you see how it's sort of weird to ask for a tip before service? The service itself was good but it is limited which isn't the staff's fault.  You get your own drinks, ketchup, napkins, straws etc. 

This time I had and IPA and the El Diablo burger and my wife had a classic cheese burger which they advertise as coming with Tillamook cheese. I can buy that cheese at Safeway so I don't find the value there. The beer comes in a glass goblet.  My Diablo was dripping in sauce but the meat wasn't seasoned enough for my liking. Wife said hers was just OK. The fries are very good here, especially the Truffle fries.  

This was our second time and out my wife and I figured it was OK but that's it.  Both times it seemed like it was going to be better than it was."}
{"text":"Their burgers are exceptional, the sides like their fries are delicious, and their nonalcoholic & alcoholic drinks are fun, unusual, & overall great!  Service is different but worth the experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Hopdoddy this week for lunch. Great concept! I was not prepared for what I found when I entered, an amazingly cool set up (when it's not too busy I'm sure). Walk in, stand in line while your table is reserved, order at the front and wait for your meal. Self serve drinks with a full bar as well (and bartender of course, that's not self serve). 

I had the Ahi burger which is freshly ground. Usually when I get this option I end up with a ahi steak on a bun. This was flavorful and an interesting flavor profile. With a wasabi chip on top, greens and a sweet/tangy sauce the Ahi paired nicely. Homemade bun FTW! 

This place is a must try if you're open to a great burger and fun experience. Tried the truffle fries as well. Without a drink it was $19, so not exactly cheap but a TON of food."}
{"text":"The BEST milkshakes!!  Burgers and fries are also good.  Like the atmosphere, but the wait and line can get pretty long at times.  Would almost prefer the service of a traditional restaurant to ordering at the counter.  The food is great though."}
{"text":"Thank goodness they weren't busy.  There was only one other party in front of us and we still had to wait quite a while to place our order.  I couldn't imagine if the place was busy.  The fries are out of this world, the raspberry white chocolate shake was meh as it wasn't very thick and the burger was poor.  I asked for it medium rare and it was brown all the way through and VERY greasy.  Combine this with the loud atmosphere and I won't go back.  There are so many better burger places and it isn't worth going just for the fries."}
{"text":"This place can't figure out what it wants to be. Is it pei Wei for burgers or a sit down brew house?  Sad thing is that it is not really good enough either way. My burger was fine, but bland. In fact four of us ordered different things and all said the same thing.  Fries were great tho.  The whole standing in line thing was annoying. Then u sit and if u order anything else, you have to pay again.  People tend to order more beers after their initial order you know... Then while we r eating, we notice the line grow to around the building. Huh? The food is simply average for a high end burger joint, so why would anyone wait an hour standing in a line for it.  This place will either go to a regular sit down format or fail miserably.  Considering indulge burger failed just up the street, and their food was better, I see major fail here."}
{"text":"Love Hopdoddy.  Fast paced with an upbeat vibe, perfect if you aren't really feeling a full-on, sit down dining experience. 

Got the El Diablo burger, based on the name, I should not have been surprised with how hot it was.  But even for a guy who likes heat, it was almost more than I was comfortable with.  Even if you aren't in to burgers per se they have, fish and plant based options as well.  

I don't do soda, but it was refreshing to see drink options from companies other than Coke & Pepsi. Sort of fits in with their local / craft theme.

One complaint? No sweet potato fries. Sort of disappointing, but the fries they do have were good."}
{"text":"I love Hopdoddy, they have the best burgers I have ever tasted nothing has come close to my experience here. The servers are really sweet and really make sure your experience here is impeccable. My boyfriend loves this place as well he usually get the Buffalo bill, and since I love spicy food the diablo burger is what I prefer. The burgers are well made and are not greasy at all you don't feel sluggish after you eat. The green chili fries are so delicious! I have nothing bad to see about Hopdoddy and I would definitely recommend it to someone."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Phoenix in a long time. The staff was super friendly. Didn't really care for the ordering at the counter aspect but the bar staff and everyone else made up for that."}
{"text":"after a day of shopping we stopped in around 8:30pm, the service was fantastic. They are very kind and welcoming. My mother has Parkinson's and they were very helpful getting her seated.  We ordered the classic burger with truffle fries, everything was amazing tasting fresh and hot. A new favorite for both of us. I don't remember our waitresses name but everyone was great! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Best burger in scottsdale.  Fresh and juicy. I had the lano poblano. excellent flavor fresh angus beef a little skimp on the bacon but overall a great burger, great ambiance and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food. Relatively good service. Only issue is that if you have a large party (6 or more) don't go there. The tables do not move so your party will be separated and if it's busy getting tables close together is impossible. It's unfortunate because I have a large family and we love the food but we don't go there purely because the seating."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy drew me in for my first visit when they opened a while back because they offered a grass-fed burger. On my most recent trip I learned they no longer serve that option, but they do still have a grass-fed bison patty option. 

As a burger bar, they definitely make delicious burgers. One of my favorite parts is the gluten-free bun you can get. Frankly, I'd like to gobble up that alone with a big schmear of butter if I could. It's like a biscuit almost. 

Hopdoddy prides itself on using plenty of local ingredients which is great. The more local the better in my book. 

I'd give the place five stars except the place is so dang noisy once tables start filling. I also think the process of standing in line to order and then going to sit seems out of place there. I like that at Chipotle and other places, but Hopdoddy seems like a place where we should be seated in a more traditional way."}
{"text":"We had a great burger experience here!  I read other reviews and even though I was discouraged by the line, my husband wasn't and so we waited. We were encouraged by a passing waiter to sit at bar and was I glad we did!  (Although the line moved so quickly we didn't really get a jump ahead of any other orders.). I was excited to see so many local AZ beers on tap and hubby LOVED the fresh margarita with no premix. 

I chose the black bean burger. The goat cheese was a good cheese, but I'm not that into \" really goaty\" quality, so next time I'll order pepper Jack and be thrilled. Hubby got the bison burger,hesitating because they're typically dry. This one was fabulous!  

I love this concept. I get that it's not really kid friendly without a kids' menu, but that's not important to me. It turned into a spontaneous date night with hubby instead, without rug rats running around!"}
{"text":"Come here when you want  a burger and booze fix or something more happening than fast food. (I've heard the shakes are good too.)  Had the tuna burger and was a little dismayed to find it ground. Good tuna? Just sear it please.  Still, the fried wasabi seaweed was a nice addition. Fries and burgers are good too.  There's an ease to this location, access, parking, proximity to Harkins theaters. Be prepared to stand/order in the line, be given a number to hang on your table and have your food brought to you."}
{"text":"Exterior:  Very clean landscaping and easy parking.  The building is rather large and inviting, I like the logo of a Cow chewing on some hops.

Interior:  Green and blue colors that pop, booths and high-top tables look inviting, low tables look a tad uncomfortable for larger humans.  The booths have a rail down the middle to rest your feet which is a cool touch.  Large TVs in the four corners of the Restaurant.  Cool Bar area to the right, dining to the left.

Ordering in this restaurant requires instructions which are never a good thing in my experience.  I suppose they are doing this so people don't take up all the booths first while others are waiting in line?  So you get a table assigned to you before you can stand in line to order, seems a bit odd.  We arrived and I wanted to wait for a booth so several people were put ahead of me since they settled for a high top.  This would allow a whole family to wait in line and decide what they want instead of having to \"hold\" a seat, I didn't like it but I can see the reason they are doing it.

Food:  Burger came out medium-well when I asked specifically for well-done, tasted pretty good but in all honesty Five Guys and Smash Burger beef tastes better and I was expecting more from Hopdoddy.  I had the original burger with provolone cheese.  I also ordered Kennebec Fries which surpassed my expectations.  They have a nice selection of craft beer on tap and big ice cold chalices for serving.  I choose to sip on a Lumberyard Hefeweizen during the meal and the beer did not disappoint.  We also ordered a Caesar Salad which was underwhelming.  I know this is a burger place but if you are going to put it on the menu do it right.  The lettuce appeared maybe a bit past it's prime, it was soggy.  I expect a Caesar Salad to have crisp lettuce, there was also too much dressing and the fried Garbonzo Beans were too hard.  Last but not least was the Milkshake, we tried the Vanilla Bean to get an idea of the quality of the ice cream.  Served in a Plastic Cup with canned whip cream it was a pretty big disappointment.  Give me a nice glass cup for the price.  The ice cream did taste good, but the cheap whip cream cheapened the product.

All in all a pretty decent meal if it was a tad cheaper, I was expecting better considering all the positive reviews.  I felt the restaurant had some discontinuity between the lovely glassware for beer and plastic for the milkshakes.  I know kids come here but plastic should be requested by parents not the norm.  Seating is a bit odd but not burdensome and on my particular day there were flies all over the restaurant, not appetizing."}
{"text":"The burgers are spot on. Unique flavors and delicious. The atmosphere is really fun and the concept of ordering and having a table chosen for you is nice. It takes the pain of having to find a seat away. 

However, I was really not impressed with wait staff. They say that someone will come around to get refills, take more orders, and get anything you need. That would be great if someone ever came around. 

One thing that didn't meet my expectations was the chili cheese fries. They are definitely not what you would think. There's very little \"sauce\" and it really doesn't seem like it contains any chili. It's just portrayed all wrong."}
{"text":"Food, seasonal cocktails and milkshakes are all super great! The line /seating situation leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is a go to when you want a good burger that is quick and consistent. They have a few yummy salads with protein added options. Their fries are perfect- not too thin or too thick. They have sodas sweetened with real cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Although I'm super disappointed they took away the grass-fed beef option as that was one of the main reasons for my frequented visits, I will continue to eat here, just not as often. I would like to recommend to the management and owners of this establish that the current type of service system they are using is weird and confusing. You go up to a cashier to order, but do not pay until you eat your food. You have a server who may or may not show up more than once to your table. It's all weird. This is definitely the case so they can avoid paying full hourly wages and continue to allow the \"tipping\" system to pay their employees. Either make it a fully fast casual establishment or a full service restaurant but this half and half thing is a turn off. Like I said: good and consistent food but there are some things that should change to make this place more user friendly for its guests'."}
{"text":"It's good.  Shakes are good.  Food is good.  You stand in line to order and then they bring the food to your table.  Sometimes the wait can be long.  But overall, good restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a hamburger snob, and have worked as a cook in fine dining.

With that said, I give Hopdoddy a 3-star \"meh\" rating.  First, we have to stand in line to order, which I'm OK with, really; but then we have a \"server\" that does JUST a bit more than someone at a buffet, so we feel compelled to tip him more than a couple of bucks.  Either earn your tip by being a real server - answering questions, making suggestions and visiting more than once to ask \"how does your food taste?\".

The hamburgers are reasonably priced until you discover they're something you'd get from a kid's menu.  I realize that food prices are high and that rent in Scottsdale ain't cheap, but damn man - this was about the size of a McDonald's double cheeseburger.  Oh, and if you're going to serve \"El Diablo\" it should probably have some zip to it.

The truffle fries didn't taste of truffle at all.  They were cooked well, but that's where the magic ends.

Anyway, I won't choose to go back because I can get a better, sloppier burger from In-N-Out; I don't care that it's not from a cow that had Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata (13th Century Opera) sung to it."}
{"text":"Really good! I got the \"goodnight\" burger and I was very pleased. Fries were also very good and the selection of fountain sodas is very unique, but so delicious."}
{"text":"Sorry, but Majerles Sports Bar has burgers that make these look like White Castle burgers...in case you don't know White Castles, their burgers are tiny, like sliders, and the HopDoddy price is outrageous! Some of their burgers had an asterick, and if you read the tiny print, they will add up to $5 extra for a burger....I have never paid $18 for a burger, and never will! I asked the bartender if the burgers were 1/4lb or 1/2lb, and the answer was they are 7oz, but they don't look like they are almost a 1/2lb burger! The fries were seasoned, not well seasoned, but seasoned. The burger was tasteless if not for the lettuce, tomatoes, and special sauce. I had to add salt to give it some taste. What this place is really great at: MARKETING! They build it up like a new experience that will have you coming back night after night --- NOT!!! Don't waste your money here, unless you don't mind paying $$$ for small tasteless burgers!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. Amazingly friendly staff, fast service and a great deal on a burger and beer for $10 bucks. You can't beat that. Grab a menu and place your order right away. You'll be given your booth/table number or can sit at the bar and the food is out in no time. When it does arrive you won't be disappointed.  The only thing better than the quality of the food is that of the service. Our server Alex was very attentive and super friendly. Tyler, the manager also checked in on us during our visit, which speaks to the level of customer engagement and the reason this place runs so well. We will definitely be back for more. I can't wait to try more of their burgers and brews!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers here, however have been left with a sour taste in my mouth. We arrived tonight, ordered, and then were told they do not have any fries. This would normally not be a big deal, however, we were not offered any alternatives and the gentleman working the POS was not the nicest about it. It seems odd to me that there was no attempt to get fries to sell at a burger joint. After getting to our table we ordered beer and one of our party never received his. The service tonight was sub par as a manager never checked on us nor attempted to rectify any of our concerns. I think the most disappointing part was that we came here for a birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food here is amazing! But the way we were treated tonight was terrible and enough to make the food not worth going back. After ordering our food, we were told a server would come to our table for us, because we specifically asked for them to order some drinks from our table since we hadn't decided yet. Once we sat down, we waited at least 15 minutes. A woman brought our food and I asked for our server to be sent over. Another 20 minutes passed and once we were almost finished with our food, our server came over. All he said was \"did you need something?\" We ordered our drinks, and then finished our food and waited and waited, and finally about 20 minutes later with no sign of our server and no drinks, we left. Terrible service, and yes I understand the way that hopdoddy works."}
{"text":"Good burgers, shakes and fries.  Good service.  Fun place."}
{"text":"I like to think I know a thing about burgers, them being my favorite meal choice, and this place has truly phenomenal burgers. I got the el diablo and it was cooked a perfect medium rare and not too much heat either. The peppers and the chipotle mayo complimented each other perfectly. The menu is a la carte and fries and chili com queso were tremendous. There was plenty of seating when I showed up, and the only conceivable negative is only 4 TV's in the whole restaurant. Fantastic food and at a good price."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars, we came in to eat today this Sunday June 4th around 2-3pm and immediately got bad vibes. We were sat at the bar for a to go meal cause we wanted to have takeout.

The bartender, didn't catch her name but she had reddish brown hair. My husband said can I have a coors light and she quickly said, no... 

Nothing else, just no. I think she was trying to make a joke. That's not funny to me I find that unprofessional actually. I have been a bartender and a server for many years and I understand the struggle. Although, I don't appreciate sarcasm from a stranger when I am paying them money....or at all really.

We looked at her like, are you going to tell us why? 

Then we paused and waited about half a minute.

She then says, we don't have it as she is laughing.

Ok... so she recommends something else but doesn't seem like she even knows what she is talking about. While she is recommending something she is clanking two beer glasses together... WHY ? She keeps doing this the entire time we are talking. Why!!!?

My husband felt so uncomfortable cause she was acting so weird. I don't really know what else they were talking about cause I was waiting for it to be over so we could leave.

I told him I wanted to leave and when we got outside he was like thankyou, I did not want to eat there she gave me such bad vibes, I was like I know right!!

$12 a burger.. nope. 

Went to Whole Foods and got a sandwich for $9. 

Hop daddy's might be good ? We will never know cause we didn't stay to eat and I don't want to go back. 

You guys should get a new bartender."}
{"text":"We went out for dinner, spur of the moment.... my husband, my sister, and I. As we ordered, we were asked if any of us were veterans. I said my husband was a long time ago (VietNam). The gentleman taking our order said that a discount would be applied. I assumed a couple bucks off my husband's burger. Imagine our surprise when our entire bill was cut in half! Thank you, HopDoddy, for your generosity to our vets AND their families. 
It is greatly appreciated!
The food was great (as we knew it would be from previous visits) and the service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"I suggest going during happy hour for even better prices . It's not pricey but during happy hour it's quite a deal . The burgers are delicious , some of the juiciest and most flavorful burgers I've ever had . Cooked to perfection . Haven't tried the chicken sandwich yet but heard that was amazing as well . Also really enjoyed the Parmesan truffle fries . On a side note their sauces are alps delicious ,especially the garlic aioli."}
{"text":"This was the most expensive hamburger I have ever had. 
The quality was ok. For heaven's sake, it was only a hamburger.  It made McDonald's or In-n-Out seem like a Michelin five star restaurant.  In addition, you have to climb up on high bar stool and then  served  a hamburger in a metal tray with a piece of paper as your dish. You want a great hamburger ?? Go to McDonald's,  In- N- Out, Wendy's, or any  place other than this place that has  a lot of fluff and no substance.  Even the name \"Hopdoddy\" is stupid. Don't go.!!"}
{"text":"The food deserves 10 stars. Such a great selection of burgers with a wide variety of proteins. Really fantastic gluten free buns. I wish they sold them by the bag too! As long as you aren't going on a Friday/Saturday night you won't have to wait in line too long. The only reason why it isn't getting 5 stars is I've noticed the service is going down hill fast... Rude girls who ignore you and choose their favorite tables. Went there with the intention of blessing someone with extra cash on the table beside the tip I left with the cashier, but our waitress wanted to take care of all the tables around us and completely ignored us. Her loss."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is the place to go for burgers! They are a pricey but it's worth it. Their burgers are sooo juicy and not dry like some other places. And their fries are even better. Always hot and fresh! Oh and I cannot forget about the shakes. Probably the best shakes in town. If you are craving a burger, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I went to hopdoddy for the first time on the recommendation of a friend.  I went there post-workout and I was not disappointed.  At first, the ordering process seemed a little strange in that you order your food at the cashier, then go searching for a table with your order number.  It's not traditional but efficient.  The quality of the burger is first rate.  They know how to cook a burger medium, which is something a lot of places screw up.  The ingredients are fresh....let me repeat....the tomato is fresh cut (looks vine ripened) and the lettuce is crisp and clean.  These are the little details that separate hopdoddy from 98% of burger joints.  Long story short, you get a high quality burger for the same price that would spend at a second rate greasy rag joint like five guys.  That being said, they are not the best burger in town...that honor still belongs to z-tejas' hickory burger! (Different price point but worth the extra bucks)"}
{"text":"Great food. Even better shakes. I'm confused by the service though. We order at the cashier, we get our own drinks and sauces but we still have a waiter who literally only brings us the food and nothing else. Do we even tip much for this?"}
{"text":"Dude!!! Beer while you wait in line to order! Cain sugar sodas! A great staff! And a very good menu! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Came in and it wasn't busy. Took forever to take our order. Had to wait for other tables that arrived after us to order before us. Told our fries would come out as appetizers. 10 minutes AFTER we finished our burgers, after asking several times and after watching 5 tables that sat after us get fries, ours finally arrived. Never received an apology or a status update. Horrible service."}
{"text":"They consistently deliver the best burger in a market dominated by burger joints. Try the Prime Time for one that has enough great flavor without overpowering the underlying patty. We waited 50 minutes the other night, but good things one to those who wait."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. They are unable to manage a crowd and while the burgers were good not good enough to offset the service. They need to rethink their business model."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and wanted to try numerous items.  First the beer on tap was super cold, plus they had my favorite (Huss Koffee Kolsch).  Then we tried both the green chili queso fries and the Parmesan garlic fries.  They were great!  We also were given the chipotle ketchup and the honey mustard which were both totally legit!  I ordered the Terlingua burger which was amazing!  The chili was on point and the Fritos sealed the deal.  My husband ordered the Goodnight burger and couldn't say enough good things....I didn't ask for a bite because I was enjoying my burger so much!  We were stuffed, but kept seeing the milkshakes go out, so we ordered the Oreo shake....Wow!  The ice cream almost seemed to have a hint of cinnamon and the Oreo pieces were sizable!  We eat pretty clean, so if we are going to have a splurge meal, we want it to be worth it....Hopdoddy is SO WORTH it!  We truly can't wait to go back and try some of the other burgers!"}
{"text":"Best ahi tuna burger ever! The staff that we have met, Katy, Mike, and Bailey have always made our experience wonderful. They aim to please and do it every time:) love this place and people!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Hopdoddy's last night. I was impressed with the staff and customer service however, the food is what brought the 5 stars to a 4. It was good but not great. The flavor was there but not a flavor that I would tell all my friends about. 

The likes- the caesar  salad / fries (crispy) /shakes/customer service. 

The dislikes- way too much wasabi on the tuna burger. Gf's burger didn't have much flavor too it. 

I would try this place again, but I think I'll try something else on the menu for the burger options.

{"text":"Happen to pass this place yesterday while driving...So Glad I decided to have dinner there last night. The environment is modern and hip...family dinner, fun date, or hanging out. The food...DELISH! I had the Greek burger-lamb, feta cheese, arugala, (asked for caramelized onion), taziki sauce, and cucumber.  That burger was devine! Not sure if its bcuz I hadn't eaten food all day, or bcuz it was new...but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The margaritas (one the rocks) was so one point-no watered down drinks there. The wait staff/bussers/bartender were very inviting and patient. 

Based on my initial visit; I would most definitely go again.


*constructive criticism* the order process is weird...there's no sign that tells you how the restaurant works. If it werent for the bartender telling us (we did look lost and confused-no hostess greeted us). U go thru a line to order-you pay-(they assign you a seat)-you find your seat-from there any additional items the waiter gets..but you have to pay again. The place was pretty busy but there was no long line. Its evident that long lines do form tho...there is crowd rope,a water dispenser and seating while you wait outside. 

There should be a \"how it works\" poster or something posted so newbies aren't completely lost (like we were-and the two couples behind us).

I did order a bottled drink Kombucha(sp?)-It was terrible. The cashier did warn me it was a slightly carbonated \"hippy drink\"(her words). My goodness-it taste like vinegar and...earth. 
My husband order the red velvet shake...he loves red velvet cake. His review-they just dumped some pieces of r.v.cake in the mix and a few cake chunks on top."}
{"text":"I loved this place when i was last there...a few months ago. Great burgers. I have since gone vegetarian and was looking forward to trying their veggie burger last night but when I got there at 5:30pm, they were out of veggie burgers - ? I was pretty bummed. The manager gave me a 10% discount on my next visit. So, I guess they handled it, sort of. Nice people, but I was still bummed."}
{"text":"First time. Food and beer was really good. Finished off my friends French fries and the waiter charged me for eating them. What a load."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for lunch yesterday. A buddy raves about the Scottsdale location so I wanted to see what the hype was all about. My wife got the classic burger with cheese, I got the diablo burger. We shared the truffle fries and each had a beer. The food was good. My wife enjoyed her burger and I really liked the diablo as well as the truffle fries. The ordering process reminded me of the habit in that you stand in line to order, get your drink and sit down then someone brings your food. Where it differs is you then have an assigned server to bring any drinks from the bar and any condiments. Just my suggestion, but for the $40 before tip that we spent on a burger lunch I think it would make more sense to be a full service restaurant where you are seated by a host, drink and food orders taken by a server etc. I felt somewhat awkward about how much I should tip based on the level of service I received. My server was great, I tipped 20%, but would feel better about that had I received full service from stay to finish. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Nutella and pretzel milkshake - unbelievably delicious.
Burger - fantastic.
Green queso dip - really good.
Fries - not as good as expected.  They are the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"My new favorite burger place....hands down. I've tried the diablo and the buffalo. Both excellent, although I would recommend asking to cook the buffalo a tad longer. I asked for medium and i think the patty barely hit the grill before flipping it onto the bun.  They did warn me that it's typically on the rarer side. I had the chocolate shake and it disappointed.  I expected a little more cocoa and less sugar (key ingredient in jersey's)."}
{"text":"I gave two stars because the experience is fundamentally flawed. The food was pretty good, though, maybe a 3. 

First, we lined up outside. It felt a little bit like waiting for a ride at the state fair. You really had no idea what was happening, how seating worked, etc, until you got closer.

They had a waitress taking bar orders in line, which frankly is the only reason I stayed at that point. However, you had to close your tab at the time of service.

Once you get in to the counter to order, still not clear on what is going on, you've paid one bill (for the drinks) and are now carrying a massive goblet of beer. You order, are told what # booth you've been granted, and pay again. If you want water, you are given a cup at that time. So, now you've paid twice and are walking around with two beverages in your hand looking for your booth number.

The food came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, requesting another beverage now means yet another bill I have to pay.

Honestly, I really wanted this place to work. I like the look and the vibe it has. But please, get a proper hostess and seat people normally. Let the waitstaff you've already hired take orders from the table. Get rid of the whole line thing. It's unnecessary and kind of a pain. It's way too much work for a semi-decent burger and a beer or two.

The menu is admittedly very limited. You can have some variation of a burger, a salad, fries, and a drink. Don't expect much else. It's like going to 5 Guy's with a bar and a trendy atmosphere. The waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. I know they all were, because literally every one of them waited on us at some point. That alone was confusing as well. I never knew who to flag down when I wanted another beer.

Once all of this is fixed, I'll be back to see if I like the food a second time, but not before."}
{"text":"For me, the food is only half of the experience of going out, so I'll do some simple math:  (4 star food + 0 star dining experience)/2 = 2 stars.  done and done.  

I'm not sure who was sitting in a restaurant somewhere thinking, \"man, it sure would be great to find a restaurant where instead of sitting comfortably in a booth while someone takes my order, I could be standing in line waiting to give my order to someone\", but apparently that incident took place, and this style was born."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. So much so that I've tried it three times hoping to get a better experience. First of all, no matter how long the line outside is, the hostess will give you the standard answer \"20 minutes\". It feels as though they love people standing out front in line to try and create a buzz. This is a restaurant, not a new nightclub. Well, it might be 20 minutes to get inside the front door, then another 15-20 to order. It's a very strange concept. If you are lucky you may get your own table. If not, they will either put a small partition on your table that you are sharing, or you may get a table alongside the line of people waiting to order. Problem is, you can hear the conversation of your table mates, rather you want to or not. Food is above average, and the shakes are very good. It is a little pricey. About $40 bucks for 2 burgers with fries and one shake and a soda. I can only hope they change their ordering and seating concept."}
{"text":"I have to tell you this place is excellent. I actually took a girl on a date here tonight and we had an excellent time. I always order the Primetime burger which comes with caramelized onions, arugula, and a delicious truffle aioli. The truffle aioli is warm and tangy but also leaves a wonderful aftertaste that will make you salivate even after your meal. The fries are delicious the service is orderly and for dessert? The milkshakes are too die for. Highly recommend Hopdoddy burger bar."}
{"text":"I started a Yelp account, because I was so impressed by this place. I am so excited Hopdoddy decided to come to the neighborhood. I will break down the highlights.

The atmosphere: This place felt like a modern diner. The lighting and music is just right and the positive energy from the staff spreads throughout. It doesn't feel too fancy or too cheap. It is just right. 

The staff: We walked up and saw there was a line. Initially, it put us off a bit, but the guy at the door was so nice and helpful. The fact they had a person to guide us made their unique dining concept more accommodating. They even had someone serving drinks to the line. Lines are more fun with a cocktail. Once, we got inside we walked by the bar and the bartender told us we could sit at the bar and receive full service. Best decision EVER! The bartenders were amazing. Addison and Jessica provided us with recommendations, fast service, and fun conversation. While at the bar we noticed Addison knew several other patrons by name. The fact this place already has regular clientele speaks volumes. I highly recommend sitting at the bar, but every staff member we encountered were genuinely nice and eager.

The food: WOW! Two words truffle fries. These fries were crisp, flavorful, and unique and best of all served with a truffle aioli. I ordered the Goodnight and my husband the Primetime. Both were made perfectly. The best part is they are reasonably priced and so are the drinks. A huge frosted mug of crafted Arizona beer for $5! It is nice to have a place in Scottsdale with quality food that is actually affordable. 

The process: We didn't get the experience of ordering at the counter, but the bartenders explained it to us. You are assigned a table # from the hostess then you order at the counter. After that you find your table and from that point on you don't have to get up again. You have a server for drinks, more food, and anything else you need. I admit it sounded odd, but it somehow seems to work. 

The Cons: I was too full for a milkshake, but we will be back. 

If you like burgers or beer. I highly recommend Hopdoddy."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers we've had here in the valley. Expensive but worth the price. Fresh ingredients and plenty of fries!"}
{"text":"We have been here four times now. We went last night (7/31/14) for their special which is their Ghost burger special. My other half ordered it with grass fed beef (you have to request it. $3 more but so good!!) It has ghost peppers, serranos, jalape√±o,  habaneros and ghost pepper sauce. He had to sign a waiver before they brought it to him. People around us engaged in conversation about his choice. (Others ordered it and took the challenge as well. No one fell off their bar stools) He bit into it and was raving that it was probably the best burger he's ever had. I had a bite and it was great! If I can handle the heat level, so can you! I had the chicken sandwich with avocado and poblanos. The chicken was moist and the best chicken sandwich I've ever tasted (all the others have been dry)  the fries are hot and perfectly seasoned. Not a fan of the truffle fries, but the regular ones rock! Our service at the bar has always been a good experience. Even when they were packed last night, Jesse never missed a beat! Try it at least once...if you like spicy and the ghost burger is gone, try the Diablo. A big favorite there."}
{"text":"Horrible place.  
You stand in line like a McDonalds.  No healthy sides .  Noisy and poor service"}
{"text":"This is my #1 favorite hamburger restaurant of all time! I am quit particular, picky, and I have to say that my hamburger is perfect every time! All of the food I have tried is so amazing! I go here every time I need to make a deposit into my business bank account or if I have too much time in between business meetings, and often alone. The sprouts here all the best I have had anywhere! All of the staff I have meet are super friendly, helpful, and cheerful! This place is so worth the cost and drive! If I was able to eat hear at least once a week I would!"}
{"text":"I have had the Llano Poblano, El Diablo, Primetime, Thunderbird, Goodnight Good Cause, and Ahi Tuna Burger. All delicious, and cooked to perfection. 

The beer is ice cold (literally - bits of ice on top) and comes in a big ass chilled goblet. I'm indifferent about the mixed drinks (I've tried the skinny dip, PVtea, sangrita, black cherry hard limeade, and mighty mule). 

That Oreo, Nutella Chocolate Pretzel shake though!! 

And not to mention, the service is always on point. 

LOVE this place and will always recommend it."}
{"text":"Everyone was raving about this place at work so I met up with my wife and daughter on my lunch break to go check it out.  It was totally packed which was a good sign but it also made the vibe seem really hectic.  The food was nothing exceptional.  The burger and the salad were good but not great. (even the hair that was in my burger didn't make it awesome)  The fries were mediocre.  The beer was good but it wasn't THEIR beer.  They have a bunch of local breweries on tap which is super cool but doesn't really mean points for Hopdoddy's.  Its more like points for the breweries.  Our \"server\" came in the middle of our meal to introduce himself as our server which was super confusing.  Not really sure why he is called a server.  I go to Chic-fi-la and they will bring me my food the same way and will refill my beverage but they don't ask for a tip.  Apparently I am tipping someone for introducing himself as my server.  Not really cool.  I would rather give my tip to the hostess."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and wide variety. You must try their Chili Con Queso fries. Great ambiance, you can even watch a sports game, quite rare that you get good food and a good game together, this is the spot. The milkshakes are so delicious too!"}
{"text":"We come here all of the time, but this last time we came in we were truly disappointed. I ordered the Lano Poblano burger, but without the bacon & sauce and with extra poblano. I was brought out the classic burger instead. I explained what I had ordered and the serve picked up the bun to establish it was wrong and said he'd bring the right burger out. Just a minute later, the same burger came back out to me with poblano added to it. When I asked if it was the same burger I was told it was, and I complained because he had touched it and brought it back out. He then said he'd re-fire it for me. It was brought back out, this time with bacon. I took the bacon off, which wasn't a big deal, but was frustrating because after 3 tries, my order was still wrong. Our fries came out cold as well. At no point was a manager called, etc. Very frustrating as we come here all of the time, and now I'm not sure we'll be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome service. Reasonably priced. I will be back to try more flavors of burgers and brews."}
{"text":"Burgers: 5 stars
Concept: 1 star

We've been here quite a few times. We absolutely love the food, so we keep coming back. The Greek burger and the Good Night Good Cause are our favorites! 

Now, the concept.. Guys. Pick one. Counter service or servers. Having both is confusing and uncomfortable. We are perfectly capable of grabbing our own ketchup, thank you. We don't need to tip someone to do it for us."}
{"text":"So, the food turned out to be amazing. 

But, be warned, unique set up.  You order at the bar area & they assign you a table at that time.  However, the wait is LONG!  This is no mcDonalds and sit down.  Be prepared to stand for awhile.  You can order drinks while you wait, but you don't receive your table until you order.  So part of your party can't be sitting while you wait. 

Limited kids menu and luckily we begged the host for a table so the kids could sit while we waited but otherwise they would have to wait as well.  

If you want a good burger (comes out fast), ok fries, but willing to stand awhile, then it is good for you."}
{"text":"Some great eats at Hopdoddy. The burgers are excellent as are the salads and of course the beer hits the spot. People are always pleasant too."}
{"text":"Stars didn't align tonight for our trip to FlopDoddy.  Highlights: only the Host. That guy IS this restaurant. Nice. Energetic. Was busing tables. Saw him cleaning up a table where beer was spilled. Checked in on my gf and I after HE noticed (no one else did)  that no one for the first 10 mins we were there came by and asked us for a drink order, water, nothing. Kudos to this dude tho. He is the 1-star. 

Service was awful. I think due to two waiters not being sure who had our table (#77). 

Food-- burgers are small. 6 bites. 6. And I had ate my entire burger. I'm a 5'10 190lb guy.  I'm average. Burger done in 6 bites. 6. Bites. Truffle fries were good, flavor wise, but there wasn't a frie longer then an inch. We got the bottom of the fry basket. I ordered a beer, Grand Canyon Pilsner......you guessed it, they were out of that beer. 

The place was packed, seems popular and avg on Yelp was 4-stars. But I'll take Red Robbin, In&Out, Five Guys, Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers each much 'lesser' burger joints if you class them, but far superior from a food/value standpoint."}
{"text":"Went to a wedding in Phoenix and just saw this place as we were driving down the street. We walked in and you order at the counter, but the food is delivered to your table. The staff was super friendly and explained the whole process to us. I ordered the mushroom burger, sans bun and my friend and I split the chili Verde fries. The food was exceptional, especially the fries. The decor was welcoming and modern, with the bar in the middle of the restaurant. I saw the bartender giving margarita samples out at the bar and immediately was sad I was seated at a table cuz they looked damn good. We were actually trying really hard to come back one more time during the weekend, but unfortunately time did not allow. anyone visiting the Biltmore area needs to stop by this burger place. You won't be disappointed. I'm still thinking about it all the way in California."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one so bad service.   I waited over an hour to get my food and ended up by myself cause my wife had to pick up my daughter after one hour waiting.  Was our favorite place... No longer coming here.  Avoid this place"}
{"text":"8 April 2016

BEWARE!  My husband and I had dinner at Hopdoddy on Saturday, April 2,  at about 6:30 P.M., and have been violently ill ever since.  We both ate exactly the same things: Basic cheeseburgers, Kale and Arugula salad, plain French fries.  My husband had a lemonade, and I had a small, dark beer.  About 2:00 A.M. on Sunday morning, my husband became very sick, and was awake all night long with intense vomiting and diarrhea, stomach cramps, continuous  headache, chills, claminess, fatigue and malaise.  This continued for four days, finally tapering off just yesterday.  My own bout of what I am guessing was some sort of food poisoning commenced at about 2:00 P.M. on Sunday afternoon with the same symptoms, and also lasted four days.  I am retired, but my husband was forced to miss work all week long.  

     I called Hopdoddy yesterday morning, and spoke with someone who identified himself as \"one of the managers.\"  I did not feel he was very responsive.  He said he or someone else would be contacting me by the end of the week;it is now 5:00 P.M. on Friday, and I have not heard from Hopdoddy.  I have called the Maricopa County Health Department to report the incident."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time on New Year's Eve at dinner.
Place was busy, but not crowded. Nice atmosphere, friendly/helpful staff. The burger I had was awesome, and their home-brewed IPA was great, all for a fair price. Truffle fries are great, but those are a little over priced. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very up beat and modern
The fries are amazing. I had the llano pablano burger it had good flavor but too many competing ingredients. I even took off the bacon and it still was too much. The descriptions of the burgers all sound good but very rich and heavy. It seems like they are adding way too many flavors together 
The staff are super friendly and helpful. 
I like the ecofriendly attitude and of course the full bar with lots of local beers. 
I would come again but order the basic burger and add on my own choices !"}
{"text":"Meeehhh. \"Shrugs shoulders\" I don't get it. 

So follow me on this one. 

You walk up to the door and someone opens it for you. That's nice right? 
Well then you don't really know what to do next. There is a path in front of you, one to the left and one to the right. Hmmmm I didn't go out to eat to have to make these kinds of decisions. There is no hostess. So you keep walking straight. Then you see a big kitchen. Above the kitchen counter they have a big board which displays the menu. By default you stop moving forward and look. This causes a traffic jam and people behind you also become confused. Then we were asked to step to the counter. We do as instructed and the cashier asks what we would like. I say I have no idea this is all happening to fast. I have never been here and the choices are vast.

Anyways. We order and apparently you have to take a piece of paper with you to find a table that matches the number they write on the paper. I asked the guy where table 96 was and he had a hard time explaining it... That did nothing for my confidence, being the one who actually had to do the finding. 

So.., then we find out we have a server. Oh but not a regular one. This server only brings your food and refills your ketchup. Also you have to get your own drinks at a fountain far from your table. 

The fries were yummy that's the one star. The burgers were raw not medium well and we had them send them back multiple times until we gave up and went somewhere else. We didn't have to pay because apparently you do that after you eat instead of when your in line ordering??? So weird. I'm not a fan. 

So take all of that and add to poorly cooked burgers and I shout a big no thanks to you kind sir."}
{"text":"Watch out when you go here.....they add a big tip to your credit card if you didn't write one on the slip. Gee, what if I put something in the tip jar at the counter or left something on the table?? Taking more money than I signed for is thievery."}
{"text":"I had the poblano burger and it was the best burger i have ever had!  Staff was friendly. Place was clean. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really don't like the concept of waiting in line to order. No greeter but the bartender tried to help. The cashier was too busy discussing how much money they made in tips to wait on us, but finally asked us what we wanted. Then I don't get a reciept and am told to go to table ??? Don't talk to me or I'll forget the number! The chairs are sooo tall I almost have to jump to get on it.... the burger was under cooked - but better than overcooked. And the whole concept is too expensive if I have to wait in a line to order. Just disapointed...."}
{"text":"Thank you Hopdoddy for being you! Get the Turkey Burger! It's my new favorite! Yum to the last bite! Fries compliment nicely. Shakes are out of this world. Dining experience is cool. It always seems like it might take long, but it never does. Staff are super friendly and laid back. Visit if you need a juicy burger in your life."}
{"text":"Great food.  Burgers are awsome and the beer is cold. I love the ahi tune and the goodnight burgers. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Well... I came here with high hopes as my friends in Austin,TX frequent their HD on the regular. The food was okay the service was slow and the price was a bit high for BURGERS. So maybe when I go to Austin I'll give 'er another try, but for now I shall \"steer\" clear of the Scottsdale locale."}
{"text":"Have been here three times now and really enjoy the food. The prime time burger is delicious and so is the beer. I really dislike the ordering system here and will only eat here if I can sit at the bar so I get full, normal service. Really wish they would change it to a normal sit down place. It would make it much less confusing and frustrating. Other people feel the same way based on some reviews."}
{"text":"We ended up here last night after initialing thinking Pei Wei.
So glad we did. We had the Chili con Queso Fries, the Greek, and Thunderbird.
Fries were great (is there cinnamon in the chili? tasty), Thunderbird was juicy and delicious, and the Greek was good until reaching the middle... where it was WAY too rare (we showed our server). Weren't expecting it, but they took the Greek off the bill. Didn't have any beer (gasp!), but the vanilla shake was tasty.
Even with the misfire on the lamb patty, we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Attentive, friendly staff. Stylish building. Happy hour had some great deals. Not a single thing I didn't like about my visit there!"}
{"text":"$15 for burger, fries and ice tea.  30 minute wait for food.  Food is cold, bun stale, and fries chewy.  enough said"}
{"text":"Odd set up with counter order and then some level of table service.  Price point is too high for the product, my wife and I had two burgers, soda and fries, was over $33 + tip.  Food was good but not great, bit too much grease for me but I can see the appeal.  I would opt for other local places for better burger.  Ingos for a better burger and Cibo for better truffle fries...best fries according to my wife..."}
{"text":"Wait in line to order, got bison burger that was rare (near tartare), fries were only a little warm and not so great anyway and price was pretty outrageous.  I could name 5 better and cheaper burger places very quickly.  Service was friendly, but really not doing much other than bringing your food to the table.  For this they seem to expect tips.  I can walk up to counter and get my food if I have to wait in line to order anyway.  I've been looking forward to going here since it opened but won't go back.  Sorry to burst any bubbles, but mine already was."}
{"text":"The truffle fries are pretty darn delicious; would come again just for those. Burgers were great as well. Service was excellent; Megan was friendly, efficient, and checked in with us just the right amount. Also, it might seem like a small thing, but this place has really wonderful ketchup!

The atmosphere was fun without being so loud that we couldn't chat. I would enjoy coming in with a large group, but I couldn't really see any tables that could be set up to accommodate that."}
{"text":"We visited here on our spring break vacation and the food was really good!  Love the concept of ordering at the counter and then waiting for your food and drinks.  The one disappointment was the bar service.  The drinks tasted great, but took forever to get them.  We were sat down and actually received our food prior to our margaritas.  Not the best way to start the experience.  We would have ordered more than one had they been delivered timely.  The Magic Shroom burger was great, and everyone I was with loved their burgers.  The truffle fries were amazing.  Kids loved the shakes and their kids meals.  Overall, good experience and would recommend to travelers."}
{"text":"Good food but not sure what all the hype is about. You wait in line forever .. Weird set up , felt weird waiting in line in the middle of the restaurant for a burger I could get from any place in Scottsdale ."}
{"text":"Big fan ... I go quite a bit however .. it is not always consistent and I hate the ordering system. Too many times are people waiting in line when there are tons of open tables... and in this heat, you want to be served.. not wait in line especially at those prices"}
{"text":"Great food and concept! Loved my Primetime Burger, and the fries were on point. On par with Rehab Burger for one of my faves!"}
{"text":"Been to hopdoddy a few times now, but tonight was one of my last nights in Arizona, so of course I had to stop in before I went. 

Kristen was bartending and she was super kind. At about 5:40 she got slammed and she kept her kindness to every guest and was crushin it with all the drinks orders. 

The female server with short hair was awesome and noticed the drinks were taking a while and the line got really long, she got samplers if the shake and passed then out to guests. What a great thing to do, and good marketing ;)

Again Kristen provided great service and truly made it a great last quick bite to eat. 

Recommendation: prickly pear margarita with muddled jalape√±os, delicious! 

Will miss hopdoddy when I move, but highly recommend. Burgers are always top quality and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here today when I was running an errand at Town and Country, didn't realize it had opened.  I am not a fan.  I got the Primetime burger and it was awful.  A burger some truffle fries and a soda, and my bill before tip was 23.50!  That's more expensive than Zinnburger, but the food is much worse.  Service was friendly, but I won't be going back.  You are much better off driving caddy corner to Armadillo Grill where the food and service is great or down the street to Zinnburger."}
{"text":"The CheezeBurger Gang invaded Hopdoddy on May 12, 2014, approximately 2pm. 

The Restaurant, Very clean inside and out, some patio seating on the outside, table and booths inside, large bar with several local brews inside. 

How it works \"burger bar\", you are met at the door, the hostess assigns you a table, you continue to the counter and order your burger/drinks. After the order you go find your table and they bring your food out when its ready. 

We were met at the door by the hostess, she gave us a quick rundown of how it works, when I mean quick, it was. We explained it was our first time at the restaurant, we would have liked a little more info from her about the place as we told her it was our first time but we figured it out. Continued to the counter and ordered, I had the Classic bacon and cheese,  The Queen had the Buffalo Bill, The Halfy ate the Prime Time , also an order of regular fries and and truffle fries. 

The soda Fountain, We later got the run down from our waiter who was able to educate on the sodas. They use all natural ingredients and make their own soda. Maybe not theirs actually but a Maine Root Soda Fountain. Tasted great and very fun. 

Burgers came out very quick.. all we could say was fantastic!!! the bread was outstanding.. baked twice a day and it showed. It was soft buttery goodness. The meat, awesome very flavorful and juicy. So I would have a hard time imagining that any of their styles/burgers taste bad based on the meat and bun alone. It was really good and we are already looking forward to trying another one. The fries were awesome. They cut them themselves and they were very crispy, which is sometimes hard to do with handcut fries but they did it no problem. They have a selection of dipping sauce chipotle ketchup was good!!. 

We finished the experience off with a milk shake, after the waiter said they have homemade ice cream we were sold, I had the Red Velvet, The Queen had the Carmel and Sea Salt, The Halfy ordered the Nutella and Chocolate Pretzel. FANTASTIC.. they came with a giant straw, which is needed because they all had chunks of the goodness packed inside. The big straw kind of sealed the deal they all tasted great.  

PRO's, food was awesome, we will be back. The waiter was knowledgable and service was great. I think the manager was walking around saying hello but didn't make it to our table (not a big deal). Restaurant is very clean and nice. 

CON's, I think they need to seat you after you make your order, it was a little confusing as the hostess selected a table for you when you entered but didn't really show you which one. Just pointed in the area where your table would be.  We ended up siting at the wrong table after the order. But she said it was no big deal. Four stars because of the seating system but maybe its different when its busy? Bottom line I think it could be improved.  Also we think its important if a customer says its their first time, educate and sell your place!! Especially this place a lot of special things they have/do. 

The Cheeze Burger Gang says give this place a try and add it on your list."}
{"text":"Ok burger, albeit a bit bland and seemingly not fresh as advertised. Good beer selection, lame \"truffle\" fries. I might have even given it 3 stars if not for the convoluted ordering/service system. 

I can understand \"order at the counter, here's your number\" but then you give us a server too. But that's not a server that can take your order, well they can take your drink order, and they'll bring you your food along with whatever else you need, but you still need to order your food at the counter. WTF? I don't get it, just let them take orders. Actually I do get it, they don't allow them to take your order because they are pretty lackluster when it comes to actually getting around to seeing if you need anything. Make up your mind on what type of establishment you want to be, don't just split the middle. 

I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here, save that for Delux or The Grind or even Rehab. Zinburger tops this place."}
{"text":"The Juicy Lucy is not a true Juicy Lucy' (cheese filled)...just a way to overprice a cheeseburger with bacon. Instead of splitting the tab of shared lunch (evenly between party of 2) he gave us each one menu item to pay. So weird!"}
{"text":"Drove in to AZ yesterday and stopped here on a whim, the fact that they are a dog friendly patio was a plus for us. Good selection of craft beer and the burgers we had were also good. We had the Diablo and buffalo burger as well as some truffle fries which were awesome. We ended with a Nutella and salted pretzel shake, also super tasty. But the one thing that stood out to us the most was the great customer service. Geo who wasn't even our server came out made some recommendations and told us about the place. Our server nathaniel took great care of us and we had everything we needed without asking. Also the girl at the door was super sweet as well as the other girl who dropped out food off. Great job guys we will be back when were in Phoenix. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great burger and beer!!  Full service bar so not just limited to beer and wine!  Great range of burgers. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hopdoddy. I ordered a burger special with pimento cheese, bacon, onion, watercress, and a fried egg.  I believe it was called the Pinetop burger.

The burger was excellent.  Each ingredient was at its best showing...especially the meat.  The burger itself was juicy and flavorful with appealing texture. Kudos to Hopdoddy for using beefsteak tomatoes.

The fries were the typical skin-on fries of places trying to be more than In-N-Out. They were fine, but not special.  Oddly, some were super limp and soggy while others were shatteringly crisp.  If you get them (and I wouldn't again), try dipping them in Hopdoddy's Sassy Sauce (mayo, honey mustard, and a touch of horseradish). 

The surprise highlight was my bloody mary.  Normally, I loathe beets, but I'm so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and ordered it anyway.  Hopdoddy uses beet juice as an accent to their BM mix.  They use just enough to give a little earthy complexity for depth and lend a pinch of sweetness to smooth out the rich, savory tomato flavor.  It's spicy, but still friendly.  The bloody mary is a must try for a leisurely lunch or or a hair of the dog Sunday brunch.

Hopdoddy loses a star for execution of service.  It is uncomfortably straddling fast casual and sit-down restaurant service protocol.  It's awkward at best, and it's just screaming with potential for customer service disasters.  For example, our \"server\" didn't know we were there because we moved from Table 67 and no one told him. He didn't come over until we were just about done eating and never really had a chance to connect with us because the servers are all over the place seemingly doing a bit of everything.  In short, I think the front of house needs some re-tooling.  Either do away with the ordering window or make the experience more self-service.

However, the customer service issue was hardly a deterrent.  Considering the excellent burgers, spot-on cocktails, and the pleasant, clean, contemporary atmosphere, we'll back soon.

(BTW, do not sit at Table 67 because you're too close to the bathrooms.  Any closer and you'd know exactly who the chili burger disagreed with.)"}
{"text":"The Goodnight Burger...It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite, oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, lightly toasted breast of an angel resting gently on the sassy and BBQ sauces below. Flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then, an onion! The most playful little onion, caramelized and flavorful. Then a slice of cheddar, lettuce, tomato and a patty of ground beef so exquisite. Swirling in your mouth breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweet and savory so delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin. This is God, speaking to us through food. --Marshall from HIMYM (kind of).

Walking in to Hopdoddy, it was clear this was no ordinary burger joint.  It's a hip, modern building with a bar in the middle and tables all around, including a lovely patio.  At first we were confused, but luckily the Burger Bouncer to the rescue!  He explained the process, handed us a menu, a table number, and sent us to the line.  By the time we reached the front we had decided...we both chose the Goodnight Burger, mine without the jalape√±o.  We ordered a small order of fries on the side to share, a fountain drink, handed over our table number, and paid there at the counter.

The fountain drinks...a selection of main root sodas in various flavors; some familiar, some new.  I saw bright drinks on other tables in pink, green and blue.  I chose the mexicans cola and was quite pleased.  For my water-drinking fianc√©, there was carbon filtered water though I'm not sure what that means.  Right behind that were two disposal cans, one for recyclables and one for compost.  I'm not sure if the general public is able to discern compostables (saw someone putting the dredges of a milkshake in there) but I appreciate the effort!

Finally, the service was impeccable.  Everyone we encountered was super friendly and personable.  The team here works like a well-oiled machine, using teamwork and efficiency to keep everyone happy without missing a beat.  

My only regret is that this restaurant is pretty far.  It will certainly be on my mind when we are in the neighborhood though.  The cocktail menu looked awfully intriguing!"}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant makes u wait in line OUTSIDE like a night club??!! Good thing it's not 110 outside. But the door guy swears people will!  This girl will not in the summer, no matter how good the food is"}
{"text":"Wow I had the most amazing service on the planet Matt is fannnntastic thank you thank you my last day of drinking beer until I found out about my gluten free low sugar low yeast  low carb  no gmo no HFCs  and zero calorie beverage thank uuuu"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this restaurant and I Erik definitely coming back. The best tuna burger I've ever eaten.  My husband and daughter totally enjoyed every bite of their burgers as well.  The fries are incredible.  Can't wait to tell everyone snot this place."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar.  Everyone including me was raving about the burger they ordered and they were all different.  I had the k-town(Korean), but they have bison, bean, chicken, Greek burgers. Good selection on tap.  They serve Maine Root sodas fountain drinks.  I wish we could import them to NH. 
Place was packed but the line was never long.  This is food you can't help but gobble.  Had to sneak in a post-Thanksgiving pun, sorry"}
{"text":"I have heard raving reviews from co-workers so I thought I'd give it a shot. I had a milk shake and the goodnight burger. Overall it was fine, I would have preferred for some more spice but it was still good. I wasn't blown away but I would go back again."}
{"text":"amazing food, but weird ordering system. we had the worst server I've ever experienced last night, perry, who was completely rude and disrespectful to us from the beginning to the point that it almost ruined our experience."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down hill the past couple years. I understand management has changed and people come and go so consistency isn't always there but the quality shouldn't have to suffer. Buns were soggy, the burger came out barely warm, the lettuce and some toppings were wet and literally left a water puddle under the burger. They def have made some beneficial changes like the way tables are tagged and payment at the table instead of at the reg.
But the food quality isn't the same :/ 
Hope to see this place improve! 
Used to love HD!"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is the best burger place in Arizona !If your in the mood for delish food come here .The shakes are thick and delicious .I recommend this to everyone !!!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER AROUND! Menu is pretty limited to burgers and a few salads but if you want an amazing burger - chicken - turkey - ahi or beef - all amazing on home made buns!  Milk shakes are really thick and yummy and the french fries with chili con queso are the gluttonous treat!  A bit pricy and certainly not good for your waistline but so good to taste.  Staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Really good burger. Also great service and fast. Highly recommend it to all people and Families. Also a really good IPA with a Hopdoddy label on it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. F-U-N! Fantastic,  energetic and friendly staff. Aim to PLEASE the customer. The food... DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite burger and fries places. The fries are  so good we fight over them each time! The last few times we went, the meat patties have been undercooked, even when we ask for well done. The large fries order also seems to of been cut in half which is disappointing. I hope it goes back to before the next time we go!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal at Hopdoddy. The concept was a little confusing when you first walk in as to what to do but once the hostess came to us and explained it we were fine. I ordered the \"El Diablo\" and it was cooked perfectly. It is pretty spicy as a caution but nothing crazy. My wife ordered the Ahi Tuna burger that was also very good aside from using too much wasabi so you may want to ask them to go light. Fries were pretty good and they have a decent beer selection. My one gripe was the beer glasses they use. Kind of look like Margarita glasses and they are very heavy. Overall though we really enjoyed ourselves and will come back."}
{"text":"Came here twice to take home the impossible burger. $14 for the burger ($1 to \"make it vegan\"). It's really delicious but too expensive (they don't throw in fries). Also, I don't mind paying extra to insure that I'm getting something vegan but the second time I went I got a completely different bun, cheese, and mayo. I had no idea if it either of my burgers were actually vegan or not (I replaced all the ingredients at home the second time to make sure). The inconsistency makes me think that they probably don't care whether or not you actually get a vegan burger even though they charge you extra for it. Too bad, if it weren't for the price tag and having to replace the ingredients I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have been here multiple times. Would recommend the buffalo bill or the el Diablo. All meats are grass fed and they use the freshest ingredients possible.  For dessert try the milkshakes...recommend the salted carmel and oreo cookie combo."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I read a lot of comments about the seating process and I don't think it was a big deal at all. A staff member is by the door greeting everyone and explaining everything. Different, yes, difficult or off putting, no. Absolutely not an issue. 

Burgers were great, fries came in a huge portion size and were ok. Beer was super cold... like Twin Peaks cold! Service was great, establishment was clean, atmosphere was aesthetically pleasing and an excellent happy hour . We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went there two weeks ago. Food is good, and we paid our check and left and a tip. I checked my bank statement two days after I had gone, and they had charged me an extra 21 dollars on a whole different transaction (bill was 43 including tip) They charged me 43 and 21 dollars on two different transactions. I called them and I talked to the manager (Mike), I asked him to check into it and he promised me that he would call back and try to rectify it. No one has called yet and I am not holding my breath for a call back. I did not keep my receipt since every other restaurant I've frequented has not charged me extra. Please keep your receipts and make sure they do not overcharge you. 
Will be checking in with the BBB to see if there is anything I can do."}
{"text":"It was a lazy humpday and I've had a long day. I did not have any desire to cook so Mr. suggested we try this place out. Excellent idea, my love! 

We walk up to the front and was immediately greeted by their staff. As he opens the door to welcome us in, he continues to inform us that it was their first day opened and that he hopes we'll enjoy the experience. He passes us to another greeter who greeted us and explained how the concept worked. She said that our table will be ready for us when we're finished ordering at the counter. The restaurant is well designed and staff is super friendly. The ordering method of this place, however, is very peculiar-something I've never experienced before. Luckily, we came before the crowd and was seated immediately.

Observing the restaurant and reading their service culture, the restaurant proclaims they use the freshest ingredients and grinds their meats in-house. They also bake their own breads and cut their own fries. Lovin' it already!

Onto our wonderful burgers: I had the El Diablo which had Angus beef, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, Habanero and Serrano peppers, and chipotle mayo. I also added an over-easy egg to top it off. This burger is one of the BEST burgers I've ever had. It was so fresh,so juicy, and oh so so spicy. There was a slight crunchiness from the lightly toasted bun and the meat was perfectly seasoned and precisely medium-rare. Mr ordered the Buffalo Bill which was made of Bison meat topped with an over-hard egg, Apple-Smoked bacon, their \"Sassy Sauce\", Frank's hot sauce, and Blue Cheese. Again, meat was super juicy and all the flavors worked so harmoniously well together. We also shared an order of their Parmesan truffled fries and Sunbrew Beer. 

The waitress we had at our table was a little too friendly, almost to the point of awkwardness. I don't think she knew exactly what to expect from customers on their first day opened but nonetheless, we had a good time. 

We will definitely be back and have already recommended this place to friends. Can't wait for the next round to try their amazing shakes!!"}
{"text":"The best burgers and milkshakes in Arizona!

All around phenomenal, as always!!

HopDoddy never lets me down. If you're looking for the best place for lunch or dinner in the city, look no further."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! Me and the boyfriend will definitely be back. The burgers were amazing! Not to mention a killer michelada for 5$ NEWEST SPOT"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great service! Definitely quality on all levels here : )"}
{"text":"Not anything special. $30 for two burgers, 2 sodas, large fries. Burgers are ok, I liked the fries. I still prefer in and out over this place. I find it awkward to stand in line to place my order when they have servers. Why not sit down and take my order? People were not sure who was in line or who was waitin for a drink at the bar. It was cool to try but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Legit contender to the burger wars. As far as I know, at this time, this location is the only one outside of Texas. And it is very good. 

Order in a line, get assigned a table, go grab your drink and sit at said table. They will find you and bring you your food. awesomely simple and efficient. My Mushroom Burger was very good, incredibly juicy. Wife had a Kale salad with a well seasoned and absolutely delicious turkey burger patty. I was surprised how tasty the turkey was and this hard core beefivor would actually consider one next time. Parmesan truffle fries were an incredible addition as was the vanilla bean and cinnamon shake. Just wow. The shakes alone might be worth the trip.

Great casual/hip environment, lots of craft beer choices, full adult bar libations, organic items as much as they can be found locally.... This place is a hit. Definitely now in our monthly rotation. #loveit"}
{"text":"This spot has only been open for one week and they are off to a great start!
We were immediately greeted outside the front door and told to walk in and meet the hostess who would assign our table number. So you go in, take your place in line and then the hosts will come over and give you a sheet of paper with you table number. We were given menus and deciding what to order. The line goes right past the bar and the bartender wasted no time offering us a drink while we waited. He then mentioned that the seats at the bar are first come first served and full-service. So we quickly got out of line and bellied up to the bar.
The beers looked really great, but being a work day, I just stuck to water.
My friend and I decided to split the Poblano burger and an order of the fries with Green Chile Queso.
It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to arrive, they split the fries and queso, but we had to split the burger ourselves...no biggie.
The queso we got was quite red in color i think it was the chile con queso as opposed to the green chile version we ordered, but it was delicious anyway.
The burger was cooked the way we asked (med-rare) and it was stacked high with toppings and the bun held up to all of the juice. I went though about 4 paper towels during the meal, which to me is a good sign when eating a burger. 

I am excited to go back and enjoy some adult beverages with some of the best fries I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and amazing food. The wait staff are all amazing - great personalities and cool under pressure - particularly for how busy it gets. You will love this place and I guarantee it will become a regular for you just as it has for my family ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered queso fries ,got cheese sauce 15 minutes later, had no fries left at that point....also your a trendy burger joint and you can't even cook medium rare...really ..don't let the little things kill you..jus saying...maybe your lead line shouldn't deserve that after shifter ..while still pretending to work."}
{"text":"The burger was great, fries were delish and service was fast and friendly.  Love the atmosphere and the fact that they have TV's so you can watch sports and have a great burger!  Ordered the Nutella pretzel shake for dessert...wow...that was yummy!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The ordering system was different: they tell you the table number to sit at first, then you order at the counter and they bring you the food when it's ready. 

Despite that, the food was amazing!!! I had the Greek Burger (lamb with arugula, tzatziki, cucumber, feta, tomato) - super fresh and filling! My friend ordered the La Bandita (black bean) and the truffle fries, which were both delicious as well. 

Save room for a milkshake too! The Nutella and chocolate pretzel one was wonderful."}
{"text":"A couple of days ago our family tried Hopdoddy.  There were so many new and interesting food and drink combinations on the menu.  We each ordered something different and were all really pleased with the taste of each item!  The employees were very attentive and also just plain nice.  It was a great dinner.  We recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I guess I skip the confusing part of there ordering system I just walk in and sat at the bar they give you a menu and take you order like at normal restaurant but I had know idea that they had soda fountain or a sauce bar till reading other reviews but anyway I had the Diablo burger with I was super excited about because I like it hot it was not the bell pepper would be just as hot it said it had habanero in it be no heat at all now the burger was juicy but need to be seasoned more no real flavor the bun was soft and spongy very good I had the Cesar salad it  was different then I ever had before it had all kinds of veggies and nuts the dressing was creamy very flavorful it's just to small for the price the red velvet cake shake is outrageous good it would be better if they use real ice-cream instead of soft serve but I will just stop in for that shake over all it just OK"}
{"text":"It was our first time. Horrible Greeting and Service. No one helped us. Stood at door for 5 mins. Walked out."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is HOPPIN! Busy, upbeat burger bar with some great food. Walk in, grab a menu, place your order at the counter, and then they'll bring the food out to you! They've got a full bar as well, so if you want to sit there you can sit there too! 

Large selection of burgers! They can accommodate to whatever you need. Vegetarian? They've got something for you. Not feeling beef? You can get a salad or a chicken burger. Want some Kobe beef? They've got it as well! Lookin for something more sweet? Order a milkshake with your burger! 

I've had their primetime burger and their Llano Poblano burger. Both were juicy and flavorful! Ordered some truffle fries as well, those are 10/10! Fries come in large portions too, so you can definitely share em. 

Servers are super friendly as well! They walk around to make sure you've got everything you need and will go get it for ya! 

Come here for dinner, your tastebuds with thank ya"}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! I tried to think of even one thing negative but couldn't come up with anything. That's how good this place is!

Upon walking in we were greeted immediately. We were told to look over the menu, order at the register and they would tell us which table to sit at.

I ordered the shroom burger and got it as is... delicious! Juicy, tasty and seasoned wonderfully. The aioli sauce was a great addition to this burger.

Hubby ordered the Buffalo bill as is and he thought it was extremely tasty. Sassy sauce was good on it also.

Daughter ordered the impossible burger (plant based) and we were all happily surprised by how delicious this \"burger\" was! That will definitely be ordered again!  It was very moist and the seasonings were fantastic.

We shared a large sweet potato fry which was plenty for the 3 of us. These were crispy and yummy.

The soda is a brand I've not heard of (Maine Root and Mexican Soda). I tried the diet with black cherry and that was good.

Meat is ground on site every day so it's always fresh which may contribute to the wonderful taste. Also no antibiotics or hormones in the meat and the condiments don't have any high fructose corn syrup and you can tell the difference.

A server came to our table a few times to check on us, fill up drinks and take away trays. All the time friendly and answering my questions (what's in the impossible burger-plant base with hem?, can we buy them for home-no they are made fresh daily, or questions about other menu items).

I would definitely recommend this place and the little higher price is worth the deliciousness, freshness and overall nice vibe of the place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Hopdoddy.  It was my first time here and first time in Arizona.  Casual dining with fresh fries and burgers.  The Primetime Burger was delicious! The burger had an angus beef patty, cheese, arugula, caramelized onions, truffle aoili, all the goodies to make a tasty burger.  The burger I wish was larger in size, I finished it wishing there was more.  We also got the Green Chile Queso with Fries and that was addicting.  The queso was so good I wanted to drink it out of its' container.  The fries had really nice texture, slight crisp on the outside and so perfect with the queso or even on its own, comfort food to its finest.  Would definitely come back to Hopdoddy in the future, already craving for their burgers and fries as we speak."}
{"text":"I love burgers especially bison. They produce a fantastic one here. The fries were much crisper and better than even McDonalds. The place is happening and I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great buffalo burgers and fries, all very natural. Fun and happening place with a great beer on tap selection too."}
{"text":"Wow....great organic food!!!

Fries are great; burgers awesome, and organic soda.

Service was amazing"}
{"text":"Giving a 1 star only because of the customer service!!!!! Last Sunday 11/6/16
I was excited to bring my sister here for the 1st time. This was my 4th time coming to hop doddy and I absolutely love the burgers the fries are amazing but on this occasion the customer service was horrible or should I say not there. We ordered at the counter per usual got our drinks and we seated ourselves. After receiving our meal No one EVER came to our table to check on us. I had to flag someone down to get our check. There was a server assisting the table in front of us and behind us but again we received no service what so all!!!! The waiter we flagged down was Ryan he was very helpful and apologetic at the end but I know we weren't in his section so kudos to Ryan for helping us out. Won't be back for awhile but hopefully Ryan will be working if I do return."}
{"text":"Best burgers! The Primetime Burger is amazing (Brie cheese, arugula, carmelized onions, steak sauce). I also love their kale salads and milkshakes. The service is always great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great location, nice atmosphere. You order at the counter and find a seat, your food gets delivered and than you have a server if you need another drink or anything extra. Their food is AMAZING. I've tried several different kinds but the Ahi Tuna burger is my favorite. Definitely get the fries to share and a shake to go!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very bubbly gentleman Aaron  who gave us the details to check out the menu and order at the counter. Our server Melissa was awesome, prompt, and friendly. I ordered the bison burger and shared the truffle fries with my friend, both were great. She had the chicken sandwich - she loved it as well! Of course we needed desert and had the Oreo shake...YUM!

They have a burger & draft beer special for $10!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, great burgers with the lettuce wraps. They do the best job with the bun free option."}
{"text":"This was our second time there.  The food is always good, but this time around we felt that the burgers could be a few ounces larger, and the small fries are not enough to share.  I'd be happy to pay an extra $2 for a larger party.  If you don't order fries you will leave hungry.  

The process of ordering is a bit confusing.  There is a sign that instructs you to get in line and order while you wait for your table, but we had a larger party of 5 so the hostess asked us not to wait.  Once the table was ready we were asked to get in line an order .. so very strange.

One other confusing part is that it wasn't clear who the waiter/waitress is, so we asked one of the people that stopped by the table to drop off stuff for an extra order of fries and it never arrived.  We had to flag someone down later and we didn't get it until we were done with the meal.  They were nice enough to take it off the check without asking, but I believe someone needs to fix this experience in general because when it came to tipping, I wasn't quite sure who I was tipping."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  We came here last night 3 adults 2 toddlers one drink and it was over 70 dollars!!!  Totally not worth the price tag!  Food was fine, pretty average.  There were flies everywhere which was really disgusting!!  Only really good thing are the shakes!! Pretty funky ordering system too! If management reads this...... Do something about the fly problem!!"}
{"text":"Used to be great a couple of years ago but a complete disaster tonight.  Waited in line over half an hour, never saw a greeter, but that's ok we'd eaten here before and knew the drill.  Saw at least a dozen groups come after us stand around for 5 mins or so and just leave.

Anyways, we eventually ordered our burgers and fries and got to our table.  Half our order showed up after another almost half hour wait, luckily it was the kids food.  5 or 10mins pass and my wife and I asked about ours, they said if should be right out.  Another 20 mins later we flag another server who can see we're clearly getting annoyed.  She apologizes goes over what's missing and will see it gets rectified right away.  Another 15mins goes by and we've had enough and just want to leave.  I go back to speak to someone who clearly recognizes me and knows our table number and says they'll get the manager (Josh).  Another wait while they try and track him down.  When he finally comes out he's just short and says he'll refund the meal... He's certainly not a people person.  Wasn't about to wait for them to try and make our burgers a third time and wasn't interested in anything for next time as there will be no next time.  Too bad was once pretty great."}
{"text":"Hey Hop Doddy, You're great 90% of the time, but last night was not the best experience. Two quick notes:

1) After waiting for 20 minutes and being at the head of the line, the hostess or seater tried telling us that they were all out of inside seating. I told them we would wait and then counted three empty booths inside. Don't try to make a customer who has waited their turn sit in the heat (yes, even with misters), if there are open tables. That's dishonest and unfair. 

2) After resolving the whole table debacle there was still another wait because one of the cashiers left and was chatting and laughing with other staff members for a good five minutes (with the line practically out the door). 

Show you deserve and know how to handle your popularity. Don't seat outside unless you have to when it's over 95 degrees. And communicate with your staff that the dinner rush is not the time for breaks. Just suggestions, other than that, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy makes my top 5 Arizona burger list. I've been to Hopdoddy's in multiple states. Always solid, always consistent. It's a huge plus knowing you can go to a burger joint and get a quality, tasty burger along with great fries and a local beer. I usually go for the Llano Poblano burger. I think the big draw for me is the juicy meat paired with fun topping combinations. I would recommend skipping the turkey burgers here and going for the real meat. Topping off with one of their rich milkshakes does the job nicely. I suggest trying the sleeper nutella shake, it weirdly works well. Until next time Hopdod!"}
{"text":"I've been here for work lunches quite a few times. The ordering system is definitely not what you expect with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant but it works nicely as far as lunch rushes go. I've had the veggie burger and the continental club and the continental (turkey burger) is hands down one of the best sandwiches/burgers I've ever had. I'm not in love with their veggie burger by any means. Someday I might try the kale salad because it certainly intrigues me.

Haven't tried the milkshakes but they have specialty fountain sodas and pretty decent iced tea.

Truffle fries are a lot to take in...so I would go with the regular.

Lone review short: it's good but the ordering structure could potentially bother you. The food is good, but a tad expensive for a lunch burger. But it's definitely worth the experience is you are a burger aficionado."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Kids loved them and said they were the best burgers they ever had. Beer choices were good too and the truffle parmesean fries were devoured before the burgers ever made it to the table."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town wouldn't go any where else after eating the burgers here if you have tried this place it's a MUST TRY PLACE any burger you  get is great"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location ever since they first opened. The food is phenomenal. I love the variety of burgers, toppings and sauces. Everything is made with natural ingredients. However, in the last year or so, the service has gradually declined with last night being the nail in the coffin for me. I went with a group of people and one ordered a beer. We watched it sit on the bar counter for 10 minutes, watching staff pass by it time and time again. Finally, my friend just went up and asked if we could take our beer. We ordered fries to come out with our burgers and the MANAGER delivered our fries to the wrong table. Once we notified staff that this happened, there was no apology or anything. We finished our burgers before the replacement fries even came out. The manager never reappeared while the remaining floor staff seemed blissfully unaware there were customers in the restaurant, opting to sit in a corner booth and chat with each other. The food is great but it's not worth going to with service like that."}
{"text":"Burgers were good, garlic fries were addicting, oreo milkshake was not worth the price. Overall good food. Still, I felt the ordering process was unclear (all the way in the back of the restaurant) and someone had to tell us how to order: customers order, then sit, then pay; so it's half fast-food, half sit-down style. Regardless, I highly enjoyed the atmosphere and the nearly 360 degree windows!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. The host, waitress and cashier were extremely accommodating and friendly. Also love coming here and sitting at the bar. Love the rotating $5 happy hour specials! Especially impressed with the 16 year old working there that was very pleasant and great at his job! One of our local favorites!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! First time I went I had the veggie burger. Its not easy to get one of those right. Theirs is great! Best I've had anywhere. Today I tried an actual burger and I loved it. I'm one of those ppl that eat burgers well done and mine was not dry at all.   Everything is fresh tasting. I don't think you could go wrong with anything here. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Walked in 5 minutes before happy hour.  Waitress, fast talking blonde, seated us and told us we can have wait service.  mentioned to her, it was out first visit, wanted to take advantage of happy hour.  She asked about it and was told, in 5 minutes the register will be ready.  Ordered, shakes, one order of truffle fries, one Caesar, classic burger and Primetime burger, bill was $44.00. Got $2 off on fries, THAT'S IT! Waitress did not tell us what burgers are $5!!!  Two stars are for the fries and shakes.  The Burgers were very salty and their sauces tasted weird. Do not plan to return."}
{"text":"We discovered this place one night after a funeral service in North Scottsdale and have since driven out from East Mesa because its just that good. Be prepared to wait in line to order but then you have full service once you're seated. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, the truffle fries are to die for and then the fresh made thick shakes just top it all off. As I'm writing this I'm want to drive out there and go get this for dinner. One visit I had an issue with my burger and  they promptly dealt with it and then were more than gracious with comping and discounts on the bill."}
{"text":"One of the greatest restaurants in Phoenix! Great, pure burgers!

Try the one with mushrooms

I really recommend Hopdoddy"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar - Shoot!  The Turkey Burger ... good Lord it's good.  I'm not use if the other burgers are stuffed with anything but the Turkey Burger is.  I ordered the Continental Club.  The Continental Club comes with a turkey burger that stuffed with sun dried tomatoes, apple-smoked bacon, provolone cheese, arugula, mayo, basil pesto and whole wheat.  It was absolutely delicious.  I didn't order any fries because the burgers were so big.  I also didn't try any of the beers.  Next time maybe"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have loved it each time! The ordering process is confusing, you stand in line to place your order, you have to get your beverage and go to the assigned table and then a waiter attends to you the rest of your stay.....basically for the tip. Anyway...overall good food. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Had the classic, unless you like your cow still mooing, make sure you get it well done.  Great burgers, truffles fries are much better than other places and their sodas are all sugared naturally.  Good place will make the trip back."}
{"text":"Went today to have a burger for the 4th, was busy but went quickly. Much better than last visit despite the line. Primetime burger is where it's at. Worth the extra money. Was cooked perfect. I'm already craving more. Truffle fries are ok."}
{"text":"Burgers were only warm not hot for just coming off the grill, slightly undercooked red centers.  Lettuce on burgers was not good, wilted disgusting.  French Fries were 70% broken stubs looks like we got the end of a the bag average again not super warm.  Which I can't understand how food just coming out of kitchen is not HOT!

Servers were nice but when we said the meal was less than average they asked why, we told them our experience, said we could had sent it back and they want us to have a great experience. That was it... No follow up from anyone else no manager, supervisor etc, you can always save a less than mediocre experience by letting someone else know they care i.e. manager.  

Had TV's on for the playoff game but no sound they were playing music so probably better places to watch a big NFL game.

Odd seating and ordering process you have to order first in line then get your seat, no real chance to \"Study or ask questions on the menu\", just plain weird to us.
 
All in all won't be coming back for just a $9 burger anytime soon."}
{"text":"Thunderbird and Bison Buffalo burger were great. Can't beat the truffle fries - ask for a side of queso instead of ordering the full fries and queso. You get about the same amount of queso but pay half as much. Happy Hour $2 off burgers and craft beers are cheap. This particular location is freezing inside, bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Tried out this new burger bar this past weekend and it was a pretty good experience overall. The restaurant is in a shopping center and easy to find. Parking is right in the front and super convenient. We walked in and were a bit confused but then realized that we had to order and then the servers would bring the food to our table. I ordered the la bandita and my friend ordered the classic burger. The la bandita was delicious! It was a black bean burger with corn, goat cheese and avocado. It was honestly super healthy and very filling with a good mix of flavors. My friend's classic burger looked pretty good too. We also ordered truffle fries to share (which was so good & truffly) and each of us got a beer which was served in a nice, big and cold goblet. 

We decided to sit outside and the nice part about the restaurant is that they bring everything to you and all you have to do is order. The other beneficial part is that you can keep ordering beer or food, keep your tab open and pay your bill at the end. The atmosphere was pretty chill and we were sitting and enjoying the weather with our beer after our filling meal. 

Overall, good food, service and experience. I am looking forward to coming back to try some of their other burgers."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, beer comes in a frosted 16 oz margarita glass, and the milk shake was something I will probably crave anytime I want something sweet!

I didn't like that the burger came alone for $8, and then you had to buy the fries separate ($6) Seems overpriced for a burger and fries. 
I had the el diablo- yum! And the truffle fries- good, but my friend had the green chili fries- we ate the truffle fries with the green chili sauce- so good!!!

It's a good place to meet with friends."}
{"text":"Not a great experience today.. Waited nearly an hour after being seated and the staff did not acknowledge me."}
{"text":"It's an absolute crime that any other place even call themselves \"burger joints\".  This is the best burger I've ever had, hands down.  And the truffle fries?  Don't even get me started.  Though my cardiologist would disagree, this is the best thing I've put into my body in a looooooooooong time."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place! It is an a la carte burger place. I ordered the llano poblano burger, medium well and the green chile cheese fries. The burger bun was delicious! It was soft enough to not cut the top of my mouth and substantial enough not to fall apart in my hands. The meat was juicy and cooked just right. My burger was advertised as spicy and it was. I loved it. The fries were a little thicker than shoestring fries, seasoned with parsley and garlic. The green chile cheese fries came with the green chile cheese on the side. That was a little off to me. It was delicious. 
I sat at the bar. My server/bartender was honest and on point. The food came out relatively quick as well. The restaurant was busy too.
If I was in the area, I would totally come back."}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely would recommend coming here for burgers.

To be honest, I'm not the biggest burger fan but I was definitely blown away by the quality of the burgers here. I got a continental club and had bites of my friends burgers. All were wonderful and would recommend any one of them.

Also definitely get their fries! Delicious and pairs very well.

My friend got a beer flight that they liked as well. I'm not a fan of beer, but would recommend for those who do!"}
{"text":"Can't say the burger I had was anything special. Taste was ok. Shake was good. The way that it is set up is weird. You order at the kitchen. Seat yourself ( where a girl tells you to sit) my ginger lemonade was great. Was warned by our server that it is kinda strong for some. I found it to be light and delicious. Took my 9 year old daughter in my one time visit and I can't say I would make an effort to return. Its just ok."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming to Hopdoddy Burger Bar. It's our treat for the week. We can never go wrong when we eat here. Open area and close to a not so busy intersection. 
The only thing that bother me is the disorganization when ordering. One time we sit and have a waiter take our order and another time you need to go to the counter then a seat is assigned to you. It's confusing at times. 
Either way, the food is filling and delicious! We can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed several of the burgers here my favorites is the llano pablano. I have enjoyed the primetime and buffalo bill and my wife loves the turkey burger (continental club). They just instituted a new happy hour or as they call it hoppy hour that takes $2 off every burger and $4 drafts/margaritas from 4-6 all week! Baller!i have not had the shakes yet but my mother loved the salted Carmel shake. They always have a new burger and shake on special so to keep it new and exciting. The ingredients are fresh and the butter toasted bun adds to the tastiness. People don't like the ordering it seems from other reviews but I found it easy and convenient."}
{"text":"Excellent burger hands down one of the best in town.  Love all types of hamburgers and would consider myself a hamburger snob.   Hopdoddy one of the better burger joints"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Loooove it.  Burgers were not heavy or fatty, queso fries are delish, and the service was excellent.  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had - hands down! Got Buffalo burger...great taste, fresh and perfect size. I'll be frequenting this place"}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for a while, and it was worth the wait. It's trendy, the staff is super friendly and burger was uh-mAzing. Delicious burger needed no sauce or extras. Just had cheese and tomato and it was so flavorful. Probably smaller than most people would like, but perfect size for me. The green chili queso for the fries was fabulous. Best of all, I had a huge craft beer with burger for only $10 (October special)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Great burgers, delicious truffle fries and a very yummy pumpkin cheesecake shake. 

The staff was incredibly rude. The great food doesn't change the bad service."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a burger.  I've been here twice.  I'll be back when it's not a work lunch.  Beers and burgers are essential.  This is one of those places where you get what you pay for... it's a little expensive... but so worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Hopdoddy after hearing great things from  coworker.  Their takeout was fantastic and the online ordering experience was a breeze.  Upon getting to the restaurant, I wish that we would have opted to eat in.  The happy hour deals are really great here and I believe it lasts until 6PM.  I didn't have anything negative to say about my burger or my fries- I am looking forward to returning during HH."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place when they opened! Me and my husband were watching it being built while passing by on a daily basis as we live in Biltmore district. The burgers and beer are awesome! Probably the best burger I've had and the orange blossom beer was delicious! Service was great too! We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great burgers and great beer selection.  The beers are huge and come in frosted Game of Throne type goblets.  They have a $10 burger and beer special that is awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious but pricey! I had the lamb burger and it was very good, cooked to perfection and super tasty. I strongly recommend the Parmesan truffle aioli fries if you have someone to share them with, I didn't even finish half. 

The Doble Fina margarita is the best! It's hard to find a margarita that doesn't just taste like mixer, I'm fine with paying more for a good drink as long as it's worth it. Overall the food was great but a tad expensive for casual dining, I'd go back for fries and a drink or share a burger and large fries with someone."}
{"text":"Great food minus the service. Our server \"Chad\" looked heavily sedated under something. When our food arrived it was incomplete and it took 45 minutes to come as expected. The bad service went on for more than 1 hour. Our cards were taken to the register and mine got lost. The card was eventually found and after 1 hour and 40 minutes we were able to leave the establishment. The manager did come and apologize for the service."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, great staff and beer selection. Introduced family and some friends here. They can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Good happy hour!!! The truffle fries are ah-maxing. I tried the Buffalo Bill with a fried egg as recommended by another review and it was great."}
{"text":"Love the burgers but the payment system is now terrible.  Who's idea was it to change paying until after we're done eating?  It is next to impossible to find a \"server\" to take a payment. Go back to the way it was when you opened. You stand in line, order your food, pay the bill and be done.  If possible, sit at the bar as the bartender is always there for you and service is much better. I have been to Hopdoddy twice in the last week and it appears the staff is really slacking. Tonight my husband and I watched while 7 burgers sat on the shelf waiting for delivery for well over 5 minutes and 4 employees were standing together at the order counter laughing it up.  The place was busy!  
I have asked two employees why the payment system was changed and this was their answer:

1). People didn't leave tips in the jar because they paid with credit card. Most people will leave a tip on their credit card receipt when paying after their meal.
My response to that-I stood in line, ordered my burger, got my own drink, fetched my own ketchup, and one person brought my hamburger from the shelf to my table. No tip earned.

2). By not paying until after eating this gives you the opportunity to order more fries and alcohol and have it on one bill.
My response to that-If I am unable to locate a \"server\" how and why would I want more fries and  another alcoholic drink?

So, go back to payment at order, and have the staff get their act together like it was when you first opened.  Your burgers are great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Theres no words to say how much I love it! Food is amazing. The chicken burger is the best. The boozy shakes are crave worthy and don't get me started on the queso fries!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome and the vibe is quite eclectic. We had the classic cheeseburger and a good night and good cause burgers. The classic was pretty cold which was kind of disappointing but the good cause was excellent. Great service, great time! Will probably be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent fries. Everything tasted fresh and homemade as advertised. Large portion- I could have eaten only half of my burger, but it tasted so good I couldn't stop. The gluten-free bun was one of the better gluten free breads that I have had! Cool concept and space."}
{"text":"Another high end burger place that charges $$$$$$ for burgers that wouldn't fill up a toddler. The burger was very tasting for both bites. Please make a burger that will actually count as a meal. If im going to go in here and get two burgers,two fries and two cokes and spend $40..id like to not have to goto whataburger after to finish the job."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I got the classic burger medium well and it was delicious. The burger was really moist and not dry and every bite I took was enjoyable. Oh and the fires were good too. The atmosphere is chill, would definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite real deal burger joint. Tap beer selection was a big plus for me as well, good selection of strictly local brew. 

From the moment the staff opened the door for us it was a great experience. They were all very friendly and helpful... Sat at the bar and both bartenders personally introduced themselves to us and took care of us through out our meal... Made sure our beer/water glasses were never dry.

Food was awesome. Ordered the Diablo burger... Actually has strips of habanero on it. This is the burger I've been searching for all my life. A real deal burger with some burn... And being able to wash it down with some San tan hop knot just made it a perfect night in my eyes. ... I might also Menton that their home made margaritas are out of this world. If you enjoy a good marg Don't leave without experiencing one.

My only let downs....  the bottom of the burger bun was soggy and though the truffle Fry's were amazing... Seemed like all we had in or basket was bits n pieces... Almost like bottom of the bag. 

4.5 stars, rounded to 5"}
{"text":"Where to start... Oh yeah,  the burgers are the bomb! The service is quick and the staff is well trained and super polite with a smile on their faces at all times.  The place is clean and there is plenty of  parking spaces. Best burger in town hands down."}
{"text":"Love the burgers! 
Love love the GF buns!
Love the Baby Kale & Watermelon Salad!
Love the drinks! 
Love the lemon / cucumber water!

But why in the hell is it always so hot and stuffy in there?"}
{"text":"The food is tasty. Very rich and tender beef and flavors. The truffle fries were great. I liked the variety of dipping sauces...Chipotle ketchup was my fave of these. The line was long Friday at 6:30 and got way busier shortly thereafter. I could see the wait being long had we not been there when we did. Pricey but to be expected for the \"gourmet\" burger joint."}
{"text":"The ordering/table system is a little odd and confusing but the staff is friendly and helpful. When you first arrive you are greeted and handed a menu and then you stand in line to order. Next, while in the line, you are given a piece of paper with a table number and a table is reserved for you. Finally you order. The cashier seemed a bit annoyed with our questions but wasn't too off putting. 

I ordered the \"goodnight\" which had jalapenos, grilled onions, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato.  The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking and wasn't the slightest bit dry (which is rare since I like my burgers cooked well done). The only complaint I had about the burger is the BBQ sauce is basically ketchup and I did not like it at all, so that kinda ruined the burger for me.

My boyfriend ordered the \"Llano Poblano\" which had poblanos, pepperjack cheese, bacon and he added avocado. As usual his was the better order. His was cooked nicely, as well.

We ordered the green chile con queso fries and those were amazing! The queso is served on the side for dipping and has the perfect  chile to cheese flavor! He ordered a beer and liked it while I ordered a fountain drink and was surprised (pleasantly) that they didn't have the typical brand drinks. I got a prickly pear flavored drink and it was good, I think I liked the color so therefore it made the drink better (it's hot pink).

Overall the food was good and the service was friendly. We will be back next time we're in Scottsdale and have a burger craving!"}
{"text":"I expected better, but they really make some silly mistakes. The fries were drenched in salt, the shake was only about 8oz, and the tuna burger used so much wasabi that it was't enjoyable. I liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went 2/24 at 7pm, sat at the bar two of us. Super packed with a line out the door. Got drinks and burgers. Our burgers were not made to our order. Me medium, the other well. Burgers flipped I got the well. The bartender didn't care to make it right and said because it was busy that burgers may not be made to your order, chuckling like he was joking.... and he walked off. It's was my second time there after being blown away the first time with how good it was. Well this time I was BLOWN AWAY and won't go back EVER! Far too many burger places to get a great burger and GREAT SERVICE TOO."}
{"text":"My last meal would be the honey hot sweet potato fries  super cute spot. Service was great!"}
{"text":"We drove into Scottsdale to go to Hopdoddy for a beer and burger the other night.  We live about 10 miles away and it's always been a good experience with burgers that are probably worth driving 20 miles to get.  But not this time.   

Right from the start things didn't go right.  The ordering process was a bit awkward because there were no other customers and we walked right up.  When I asked for a few minutes to look the menu over I felt like I was inconveniencing the person behind the counter (normally you have time to look the menu and beer list over while in line).  Unfortunately I was told that the beer on the menu I wanted was unavailable.  Then when our food arrived they didn't ask if we needed any condiments (hello... I have fries here plus I asked for no mayo which might mean I'll put mustard on it?).  So I walked back to the area they keep the condiments as the staff watched me while talking.  

Then something must have went wrong in the burger cooking process because it was way too salty.  I suspect they might use the same salt shakers in the kitchen that they have on the tables (those ones that you grind to dispense). The reason I say that is that the fries had zero salt so I picked up the one on the table and when I turned it over to put some on the fries, before even touching the grinder, a ton of salt sitting on the top went onto my fries.  So now those were also too salty.  Grrr...  I sat and waited for someone to come by and ask me if everything was ok, however no one ever came back to see if we needed anything else.  So I drank my beer which was cold and good.   

The reason I gave them an A-Ok on this review was because our other experiences here have always been good.  Everyone has an off day from time to time.  Right?"}
{"text":"I chilled at the bar and grabbed a beer from their nice selection in a very frosty glass and the bartender was quick and attentive... My Greek burger was INSANEly good, and the fries were awesome.  A bite of perfection! (Because I basically ate them all in one bite!)  
Dear cool people who own this: please expand quickly so I can show you to my friends back home!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm...where to begin. Stellar service, awesome burgers with fresh in-store baked rolls, angus meat, and highest quality ingredients. Can't wait to go back! Great job, folks!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I like it.  This was my second visit to this place.  
The burger I ordered was really good and juicy.  The bread and other things on the burger were tasty too.  The soda fountain is unique.  They have soda but not the big two.  Their soda is made with sugar cane.  I do not drink soda pop at all but tried it and was delighted with it.  The French fries were good too.  They have a couple of dipping sauces there.  Ketchup and another one.  They are both good for dipping fries into.  I think this place is a spin off another burger shop in the Biltmore area.  

Stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"This is a great burger spot if you're very patient.

They have a small dog-friendly patio, plus tons of seating inside.

I have been here a few times and rarely had issues with my food.  The burgers are really good.  The fries are terrific.  

It was $28 for 2 burgers and 1 side ... that seems like a lot, but these aren't your average burgers, so they might just be worth it.

Not worth it, though: the wait.  Sometimes when you go, the line to order is pretty long.  Then you sit down and wait for your food for a pretty long time, too.  I would rather sit down and wait for a server, then maybe have some complimentary waters or fries brought out for while we wait.  As it is, it's just a lot of waiting.  

I definitely do not recommend Hopdoddy for To-Go.  They don't allow you to call in a To-Go order, so you have to come in, wait in that long line, sit at a table while no one helps you (most recently I waited 30 minutes for my food), and then go.  Instead of To-Go, that should be called To-Go-Eventually.  

If you've got some friends/family to hang out with and you're not in a rush, you will enjoy Hopdoddy.  Otherwise, there are lots of great burger places to check out instead."}
{"text":"Make sure to bring your fly swatter and disinfectant wipes. We came around open and the place was filthy. Fingered printed glass, full trash knocked over in the bathroom, and the restaurant floor looked like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks. Even the menu that was sitting on the counter to look at before ordering was covered in something sticky. We were assigned a tables that was also dirty. My burger was good but for the price.. no way, considering I have to share my meal with a family of flies. No thanks. 2 stars only because the fries and burger was good."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  Tonight they were especially helpful with my elderly Dad.   They let him sit right down at a low-top table, so he didn't have to stand in line.  

Emily was awesome and very patient with my Dad!!!

I LOVE their GF buns & natural stevia soda!!"}
{"text":"Good looking menu, decent burgers, horrible concept.

I walk in. I'm greeted and escorted to a counter where I place my order. Had there been a line, I guess I would have been escorted to the back of the line? I'm handed a menu and given the run down as to \"how this works\" (place order, cashier gives you table assignment and then from there a server takes over and it's \"full service\"). I walk up to cashier who answers any questions I have about the menu. I would imagine that if it had been busy, this system would cause quite a back up. 

After I place my order, I get my drink. 2 stars for having the best soda fountain around (Maine Root). I go to assigned table. Server brings food. 

I ordered the burger that has chili and Fritos on it (I love frito pie and can't seem to find it anywhere). It was pretty good but overlooked. Everyone else liked their burgers but had the same issue. We also got the green chile fried and they were good but overpriced. Those buns tho...yum! Excellent! Even the gluten-free bun was good. (I hear they sell the day old buns).

Server brings check and offers to refill drinks...from self serve fountain. My only interaction with our server is food drop off and check drop off. What exactly am I tipping for? On the plus side, most of the employees are super friendly and people working seem happy so it makes for a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely a strong option for your counter style burgers, but just different enough if you're tired of the typicals like In-N-Out or Five Guys.

It's a weird setup. They ask you how big your party is, assign you a table, order and pay at the counter, then bring your food to you. I think it works fine when you're able to get seating, but when were there for a Saturday dinner, that line ended up being past the door for over an hour when seats just weren't freeing up. In other burger joints there's a more steady flow, but I feel the seating gives customers a sense of entitlement and less of a need to vacate for others. I saw at least two families with kids upset they had to go to-go.

But on the bright side, the meat options were pretty promising. They had a great variety of secondary proteins, like bison, tuna, kobe beef, or even the Impossible Burger! My friend and I split that last one as well as the Poblano. The Poblano was incredibly juicy with good spice. The Impossible Burger, while had decent flavor and the bloody juice looked promising, isn't exactly ready yet. It falls apart quite easily and bites more like mush after a little while. Honestly we both would have preferred an Impossible Chili if that's the case.

The fries were solid as always. For all 3 premium versions, it's fries on the side with dip in the cup. It's convenient if you want to split with friends since it's not messy, and good for friends who just want fries.

I also had the oreo shake but boozy. They added Bailey's for 3 bucks but it looks like it could have been any shot. I liked them together, but the Oreos weren't really bended well and blocked even my boba sized straw.

Definitely a place I'd come back to in the future. But like the Impossible Burger, some dishes were better than others. Possibly you'll have to figure that out on your own."}
{"text":"High end Impossible Burger (meatless) available here. High price also. I believe I paid $16 for it but I must admit it was delicious! Environment is cool but bar-style. Went during lunch time and the line was outrageous (literally out the door). Good place for every now and then not for a quick bite during lunch."}
{"text":"Almost every single review so far - pretty much every one 3 stars and below, and a number 4 stars and above - have mentioned the weird setup for ordering.  So...I'll start there.

We walk in and are greeted by someone who directs us to the menus in a menu holding place and tells us to step up and order at the counter.  On our way to the counter someone greets us to ask how many in our party and looking like they also might take our order.  Nope, this person is only taking our name for a table assignment.  Walk to the counter and place our order, after which they give us our table number.  Pulled out my card to pay, but nope, that's done after the meal when the \"server\" brings us our food.  Get our own drinks, then find our table with the assigned table number.  Now...that's not confusing, is it?

Then a server comes with our fries.  Pretty ok - nothing earth shattering.  Then another server comes (a while later) with our beer.  Ok.  Then our \"actual\" server comes to say hi and ask us how we're doing.  Doing ok, thanks.  Just a little confused.

So...waiting for our food thinking - ok, weird system, but the food must be awesome, right?  Not right.  Burgers come and immediately notice they are about 3/4 size compared to what you can get at many excellent burger places in a 2 mile radius.  So...must be delicious, right?  Not right.  Average, and that is being generous.

Bill comes and we pay server.  We like servers.  We want to support servers.  But...no way to justify the typical 20% plus tip we would normally give these hard working people.  Not their fault, just the system they are stuck in.  Give her a 10-15% tip to be generous, then leave.  Thinking...nobody who is a good server will stay here for long, the tips will always suck.  The system guarantees it.  

I'm sure some restaurant efficiency genius got some award for this creative approach.  For us...one time was enough."}
{"text":"When my wife and I walked up to this place, I thought \"Oh no! not another trendy $18 hamburger joint\". And I was dead wrong!! Prices are reasonable, great variety of 'hamburger' styled sandwiches, They grind, peel, bake and fry their own from locally or naturally sourced food. They focus on local (where they can get it), natural and quality foods including a wide variety of natural fountain drinks (I had a good time sampling all of the off beat flavors). They also offer a full bar for those who want a beer with that burger. Service was quick and friendly. Oh yes I almost forgot - Hopdoddy's serves one of the best burgers I have ever had. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD is the thought i had when i bit into the Magic Shroom Burger. Hands down greatest burger i've ever had in my life. The atmosphere is really nice and is priced at just about any other burger place. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I can't stop raving about this place to my friends. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to get a meal in Scottsdale!  I went there to meet family for a beer and a meal and we were NOT disappointed!  I ordered a beer and when it didn't come fast enough, our server Whitney brought me Two Huge Beers as an apology for it being late!  Great service.  I ordered a Bison Burger with the Truffle Fries and the food quality was 100% Delicious.  Whitney have is great, fast and friendly service.  I would definitely go back there!"}
{"text":"Customer service and atmosphere was spectacular. I love how friendly the staff was. It made my experience that much better. The burgers were great but the fries were a little soggy for my liking. Also, the cheese dip for the fries was way too thick. I could barely dip the fries hence the sogginess! I would not recommend the fries with the cheese. Otherwise, I would have given a 5 star."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time was good, second time was terrible. I won't be back.

Found this place back in March only because we parked on the north end of Town and Country to get to Pizza Bianco. Saw it, figured it was worth a shot as it was happy hour.

Worst thing you can hear when walking into any restaurant is \"Have you been here before\" and/or \"do you know how it works.\" 

If the answer is anything other than \"sit your ass down, we'll take your order and bring you food and drink like every other normal restaurant,\" then chances are you're in a pretentious hipster hellhole and are going to have a bad time. Take a wild guess which realm Hopdoddy falls into... As if the douchetacular name isn't enough of an indication. 

Thankfully, you can dodge this off-putting bullet by sitting at the bar, which we did. Normal service here. 

First time, ordered the Buffalo Bill (medium) and fries, along with a beer and some sort of cocktail with a hip and \"clever\" name. Burger was surprisingly solid, one of the best I've had in restaurant. I rarely ever order burgers because they always disappoint compared to what I make on the grille. This one was great, and came cooked as asked. Fries were ultra-salty, and over seasoned. Pass on these, especially since they are an upcharge. 

Beer list is typical AZ swill; nothing really good, but goes with their mission of being hip by sourcing local crap. 

Service was pretty good on the first visit. Attentive bartender that was friendly.

Second visit, not so much. Place was practically dead during Friday happy hour, a far cry from how busy it was a few months prior. Sat at the bar, and had to deal with one of the worst bartenders ever. Aside from the fact that she looked like she just woke up seconds before we walked in, she was the polar opposite of the guy I had on my first visit. 

And the burger this time was horrible. It was something made out of prime rib, ordered medium. Showed up closer to rare than medium rare. Bun was sopping wet with juice, sure sign that these are not cooked at a high enough temp, made far ahead of time, and likely frozen. No bueno. 

The happy hour isn't anything special, and if the service and food are this hit and miss, then why bother? Plenty of other places that do it right and do it better."}
{"text":"Great classic burger and the fries are Amazing! My only suggestion would be narrow down the servers to 1! Too many people stopping by the table asking incessantly if they could get us something. I was constantly telling people we'd already been taken care of. If you're wanting privacy at dinner this is not your place."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and there's always good food, drinks and service. The chef specials are always new and tasty. The Green Chile Queso fries are the business too!"}
{"text":"I'm quite confused by their concept. I was meeting someone for HH, so I came in and asked if I could order a drink. I was told I could, at the bar. I wanted a table, so I asked if I ordered some fries, if I could have a table, and was told yes. I had to pay for the fries and wine, and then got my table. I was also told that all food was had to be ordered at the cashier, so when my guest joined me, we had to go back to the cashier to order our burgers. So, by the time I left, I had to pay 3 different times (once for the original fries and wine, once for our burgers, and once for drinks we could order at our table). This makes no sense to me. The food is delicious, but seems like a hassle to have to pay 3 times? It also annoyed me a bit that there seemed to be a lot of people standing around (even dancing to the music), but we had to flag someone down to get a drink. The food is good, but I don't understand the overall concept!"}
{"text":"Being the foodie that I am, I know burgers.  Although, I believe they use a quality product, the sum of the whole is still average.  I have yet to find the perfect burger, and so, the quest continues.  I believe the perfect burger will come from an establishment that's been in business for many years.  These masses of trendy burger joints survive on a largely unsophisticated customer.  Most of them will eventually fade.  This place is no exception."}
{"text":"Outstanding Goodnight burger especially the bun and carmelized onions. My friend enjoyed her aji burger. Not too crowded at lunch. They have tables outside which is nice but a little noisy. The server (who only brought out food & the check, b/c you place your order at the counter and get your own drink) came by too often."}
{"text":"Absolutely a wonderful place with great food and a great selections of beverages \" great milkshakes\" The only reason I didn't go with a 5 is the large crowds cause the service to suffer but other than that its wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what my problem is when trying to pronounce the name of this place because I always call it HopdADDYS, but i will learn because as far as I'm concerned its the best burger in the valley.   Been here a few times and each experience was the same.  Consistently delicious burgers and friendly staff.  While I'm not overly fond of the stand in line to get a table formula,  It works out in a first come first serve basis which allows the kitchen to dish out the burgers in a proper order.  

Happy hour here is phenomenal with 2 dollars off your burger at two different times.  Spending 6 dollars for an exquisite burger during happy hour will bring me back time and time again.  Don't quote me on the times but it was 3-6pm and then a late night happy hour as well."}
{"text":"I was in town and decided to try Hopdoddy. 
Friendly staff! I ordered the diablo burger. Every time I get a hot chili burger, it's not \"hot\". The diablo was my first really hot burger. The Serrano and Habanero were delicious on this burger! 
The fries were the thin type and addictingly good! I've  had better burgers in the Midwest. However, the staff, atmosphere, and a solid hot chili burger will bring me back!  
Ps. This shares the second best burger I've had in Az, with Paradise Burger being the best."}
{"text":"I just ate one of the best burgers of my last three years of being a carnivore. It was called the El Diablo burger, with just the right amount of kick and balance of sauce flavors with the grassfed patty cooked a perfect medium. The other two family members in my party were disappointed that their patties were too rare, and I confirmed it with my own eyes, but they still raved about the flavor of their burgers. So maybe the consistency isn't perfect here, but I have to give this five stars for my very memorable burger and an overall great environment. Also, the delicious fries are very thin, small and crispy, slowing down their consumption and preventing diners from focusing away from their hamburgers."}
{"text":"I have been trying to come to this restaurant for a while, and I finally was able to try it on June 30th,2017. We got there before rush hour and we were able to choose our table. The little tables next to the bar are the best seats for a party of two. I ordered a amber beer on a goblet glass and the el diablo burger, very spicy one. Although, the burgers are a la carte, meaning doesn't come with any other side, you have to order fries to make the whole meal. Our experience was very good; our server/bartender was attentive and informative."}
{"text":"We LOVED HopDoddy! We stopped here for a quick burger to-go late one Thursday night after a long work day. HopDoddy pulled through. I ordered a lettuce wrapped burger with extra pickles and no special sauce (due to food allergies), and they didn't blink twice when I placed my order. So accommodating. We were so pleased with their burgers, the quality of their burgers and ingredients, all for such a reasonable price. Highly, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy's a decent place. They offer wonderful farm-to-table food and surprisingly fresh in the thick of hot Phoenix weather. Their style is a little hard to grasp at first especially for newcomers to the establishment, though. Read on!

So when you first walk in, you walk into the bar. There's a sign with menus that you're supposed to pick up from. Sort of like Panera, Paradise Bakery, those kinda places where you order first, then sit down? Yeah, this place does that. Except the menus are in a stand that you pick up individually from, it's not on some big board like at those other places. So that's a little unusual. SOMETIMES there's an employee that hands out the menus, but more often than not there isn't. Again, unusual.

OK, whatever, so you order your food at the counter. I get the \"Good night good cause\" burger which is a combination of \"Angus Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Jalape√±os, Hickory BBQ, Sassy Sauce\" as described on their website at the time of this review. It's good, and at the time of this review is $8.50 a burger. Sounds pricey right? Their other burgers are even pricier.

What gets weird for me here is that there's a line to tip if you pay with a card, but since you haven't gotten actual service other than having your order taken, how do you know what tip to give? So I just default to 20% as a minimum out of respect. If the server deserves more after, I don't know if I'm supposed to leave a tip at the table or go up to the counter again? 

Anyway, so then you sit down a table of your choosing. Each table has a number, but nowhere on your receipt is a table number listed, so I think the table numbering is more for some internal business process unique to Hopdoddy that doesn't have much value to the customer. Like I said, unusual.

Unusual stuff aside, let's talk about the food!

The food is fucking fantastic. The \"Good night good cause\" burger is a spicy, salty, savory delicious burger that gets pretty damn messy with meat juices real fast. Not surprisingly, every table at Hopdoddy has self-service paper towels for customers, sort of like at BBQ places.

If you haven't figured out already, Hopdoddy somehow integrates different restaurant styles, like the paper towels at a BBQ place, the self service menus of Panera, showing the bar first thing at you when you walk in etc etc. Somehow, that integration clusterfuck of different ideas works here. So truck on, Hopdoddy, you got something good going on, keep at it.

The beer selection is great, but what really makes this place shine on the drinks side is actually their \"soda\" bar, which is a wide variety of homemade root beers, such as orange root beer, blueberry root beer. This isn't some cheap, shitty Coke multi-touchscreen soda machine, it's old school, almost retro-fitted looking machine (look, we're in central Phoenix, if you're not here for hipster food/drink experiences, you're in the wrong city). Anyway, the soda is just as fantastic as the food, it stands out as something you probably have never had before.

All in all, this is probably one of the few places I am going to miss about Phoenix when I move away to Los Angeles. Just wanted to ensure I got this review in before my departure. For central Phoenicians old and new, this place is worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Casual sit down joint for quality food.

The ordering process is really weird, when you walk in you expect a sit down experience. NOPE. You go up to the counter and order your food like at Smashburger. But wait, you don't pay at the counter, you pay at your table. Is this to encourage tips? The asinine process of tipping makes me not want to tip. In fact, case in point, I haven't gone back in like 6 months now."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy has some of the best burgers at a great price!

This time I tried the Buffalo Bill burger (bison) which was cooked perfectly with interesting toppings including bacon.

Not only was the burger great but the different selection of fries including truffle fries, which are a must get and were excellently seasoned. 

The real cane sugar soda's are also a hit."}
{"text":"Tastes great! Less Filling! The Rocktober Fest is the smoking deal till Halloween night. ANY BURGER, ANY CRAFT BEER on tap is only $10!!

There is no way to beat this deal. Tasted the Buffalo Bill made with Bison grind and a precious tasty red rover Irish ale. Superb.

Added House fries for a special touch. Sat at the bar and was superbly serve by the corporate
Trainer, who opens the Doddy's all over the US.
Needless to say, I barely had to speak, as Jeff anticipated every possibility within a split second. A force to be reckoned with!

The whole experience was top drawer and quite tasty! Do it! Do IT!"}
{"text":"Matthew pulled us out of the line to tell us there was 2 seats available at the bar with full service, and this was the beginning of an amazing experience. We got a Cesar salad to start and split the prime time and the good night, we ordered medium rare, they came out perfectly. The service was so amazing and the food to die for. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.  Everything is so fresh and the prices are decent. It's my favorite burger spot. They grind their own meat and make their own buns.  You must try the terlingua burger and the green chile fries!  You will probably want to wear your pants with the elastic waistband when you go."}
{"text":"La Bandita burger...best veggie burger I've ever had. I love the atmosphere. The staff was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger place in the valley. Their burgers are to die for, the fries are a taste of perfection and their drink selection is on point.. Did I mention the wonderful service and friendly atmosphere? 
I frequent this place at least once a month and have never been disappointed. Everyone is really friendly, they have a great concept of ordering up front instead of waiting for a waiter..
The only thing I think they could improve on is the quality of their gluten free buns... They tend to fall apart really easily...but besides that, everything is delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have Never had a burger this good, or been to a more creative burger place!  The llano poblano burger had the perfect blend of flavors that went well with the chipotle ketchup.  The Parmesan truffle fries were incredible!"}
{"text":"Absolutely got blown away by Josh today at Hopdoddy. I went to order and realized I forgot my bank card at work. Called work and co-worker couldn't find it. I had $10 cash and asked to discount some of the items I had ordered and Josh tells me the entire bill is on them!!! He totally comped my entire bill and told me to pay it forward!!!! So freaking crazy! I've never in my life had anyone in customer service do something like that. I already love this place , but now I love it even more!!!"}
{"text":"2nd visit.

Continued to be impressed with the beer selection and quality of the food. 

This time we had the Greek (lamb) and the turkey burgers. Both excellent. Tasty fries as an appetizer. We had just a taste of the Red Velvet shake - Decadent. 

Best part of this burger & beer palace, is the service. Mgr. Adam and server Morgan took great care of us."}
{"text":"Not sold on the concept. 

The food was good. No issues there. 

First time in and wasn't sure of the ordering process. After looking confused the hostess hands us a menu and says we can order at the counter. After we order (you don't pay at the counter), you get your own drink and sit at the table number assigned to you. A server brings you your food and leaves and then the waiter comes by and brings you sauces. Why can't I get my own sauce? Had to wait about 5 mins after I got my food for the waiter to bring me mustard and ketchup. 

Idk. Seems weird. Like too many cooks in the kitchen. (No pun intended). It's like they do this so you have to provide a tip to the server. Id rather order at the counter, pay at the counter, grab my food when my order is up and sit down. But I guess that's not what they want to do here. Likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the Buffalo Bill burger.  It was awesome!  Comes with a fat piece of ground bison cooked med rare, Franks Red Hot sauce, blue pepper jack cheese, bacon, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.  I ate every last bite of it.  It was cooked to perfection and seasoned well.  The bun was nice and fresh.  It all went great together.

I also had regular fries and sweet potato fries with chile con queso.  Both of them were excellent.

I wouldn't crown them as the best burger in AZ but they are definitely in the upper echelon.  10-13 bucks a burger al a carte isn't cheap but you are not getting a burger this good for much less out there.

Would come back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Just a dumb concept to have to stand in line to get food.  We wanted drinks first (unwinding after work) and then decided on food. The server can't get us food. So then we have to stand in line for an hour!   Not doing that. So we should just keep drinking and then drive.  Makes no sense!"}
{"text":"I'm gluten free and they have a \"non-gluten\" bun here. It is $1.50 extra but is a delicious bun!  It's actually more of a biscuit and I want to find out where they get them and if I can buy more! They taste as if they could be made in house. The burgers were good and the milkshakes take you back to a different decade. The soda fountain has very unique flavors like blueberry soda, doppelg√§nger and Mexican cola. All in all I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Hop Doddy has a serious identity crisis. Are they a counter service, are they a full service restaurant, do they have servers or just food runners, etc? It is very confusing, seems to constantly be changing, and quite frankly is really a turn off. Went today around 130p for lunch. There were a few tables outside and the restaurant was less then half full. Got in line to order and noticed they no longer have their menu posted on the large signs behind the register. Why would you take them down? It was very easy to see and look at while you're in line. We looked around and didn't see any menus either. (We noticed they were in a magazine type holder on a wall near the door when we left. Not a very visible place if you don't know they are there). 
We ordered two burgers, an order of fries, a side of ranch, and a side of pickles for one of the burgers. We were asked if we would like the fries out first or with the meal. We said either. We were told to go to a specific table number, (which is kind of weird) got our own drinks and condiments and sat down. We were then greeted by an overly friendly waiter (seemed very fake) who had nothing to do for us as the way the restaurant is set up, you do most everything yourself. He said if we needed anything to flag him down. Our burgers were out within 5-7 minutes, but no pickles and no ranch, and still no french fries. We asked for our pickles and ranch and they got them fairly quickly, but still no fries. They took another 5 minutes. Really? The whole time we are there we are right next to several tables that need to be bussed and wiped down, all while the \"waiters\" are standing in the corner not doing much. It's kind of gross to look at dirty tables while you are eating. At least the food was pretty good. When we were done our waiter brings our check and doesn't even clear our trays. Our bill was 28.00 and change and now I'm supposed to tip. For what? So now I've spent 32.00 for two burgers, 2 sodas and fries, for lunch, with crappy service all around. Wow. Great. They need to figure out who and what they are as a restaurant and retrain their staff. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and 2 friends. We were just looking for a place for lunch and my mom wanted to try this new place out. The location is pretty good. The waiters/waitresses could be more clean and friendly. A good portion of them have tattoo's and piercings. The way you order food is kind of confusing and not efficient."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger, fries & shakes.  Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.

Awful ordering system.  Wait in outrageous lines to end up being greeted by three separate ordering places - bar, counter, and table.  The process is even more painful with younger children.  Even though we live around the corner and love the food, we go elsewhere to avoid the hassle.  They also have no kids menu."}
{"text":"As the old saying goes \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" The new menu is nothing short of a disappointment. The removal of our favorite margarita (lil prick) and the worlds most delicious Nutella pretzel shake will end our weekly visit to the once good burger joint. Thankfully the excellent service has not changed. But a great server can only do so much with a dismal menu. The truffle fries were also different, not just in presentation but flavor. They were over cooked and not presented with the mouth watering truffle dip. Overall disappointing evening."}
{"text":"Great selection of micro brews to choose from. Their Goodnight/good Cause burger is good and comes with a great cause. Check it out, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ulku, Is Amazing!!! Awesome!!!
Thank you for the amazing service!!
We are coming back to see you!
You are genuine! 
see you soon!"}
{"text":"It's great food for sure!! Enjoyed every bite. Great service! You order and then sit which in most places that are similar you aren't told that.. Then end up sitting at a table for 10 minutes wondering where's my server! They greeted us by opening the door and walked us through the whole process. Looking forward to our next trip to Hopdoddy"}
{"text":"Ok. I live in the neighborhood but have never been until tonight. The place has been here about 1 1/2 years.


The good.  Burgers are good. Fries are good. Shakes are great.

The bad. Three burgers, two beers, two fries and one shake: $59. Without tip. Food was good but not sure worth the hefty price tag. Hamburgers are small for the price, too. Fries came out with two bites left of hamburger.  When noticed, waiter offered a shake that never arrived. To their defence, a manager later offered a $10 credit on the next visit , which was nice. I would have preferred better service for the cost. Also, you have to stand in line to order, somewhat like Chipotle. This took about 15 minutes. I would rather have sat for my order. Again, for the cost, I don't see the value.

I think 3 stars is generous. More like 2.5."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, beer, and spuds. Service was great-sat at the bar. Kristin, Rose, and Glory were awesome! Personable staff and good atmosphere tonight. We will be back."}
{"text":"The first time I had Hopdoddy was in Austin, Texas. Hands down the best of the best burgers, and it has met its expectations once again. After finding out that Scottsdale has Hopdoddy, I immediately started salivating over their crafted burgers. Tonight, the craving has been satisfied. 

The cashier taking my order was so enthusiastic about helping me pick out my order that he essentially told me I needed to try half the menu. He followed up with \"you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu\". I got wild and picked the Magic Shroom with an easy over egg. Medium rare.

I think my favorite part about this burger was the goat cheese. It really enhanced and complimented the Angus beef. The egg yolk was a little runny (and I like it like that) but you can ask them to cook it all the way if that's your preference. 

Overall, best burger in the WORLD. Definitely bringing my family and friends when they come in town."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burgers in the valley. The buns are always fresh,(no pun intended). Staff is great, and of course burgers are awesome. If you still have room in your stomach I would very very highly recommend their shakes."}
{"text":"First time at Hopdaddy and I must say I wasn't too impressed. It was good but nothing special. I will say that the Truffle fries were delicious but the cake batter shake was not, it was way too sweet so we didn't drink it. The burger was really small for $12. Zinburger is so much better and you get more for your money."}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my family and each time, the food is good and the service is excellent. Today was no exception - super thoughtful cashier/order taker who intuitively recognized some needs for our kids and helped make the dining experience easier for the moms - a young man (at lunch time) and also excellent servers. To the management, you have some real gems as employees!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here. Fantastic and friendly service. The food was really good and arrived quickly. I like the concept of ordering at the counter and then have the server check back with you once the food arrives. I will be back - I want to try aaaaaallll the burgers! I had the Diablo. Just the right amount of heat for me. I couldn't decide which beer to order and the staff helped me -- it was delicious. I can't wait to being my husband here."}
{"text":"Killer burgers in a variety of meats. 
Wonderful fries.
Interesting selection of drinks, 
Go!"}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the area today and needed a quick Burger pitstop. I've had this joint bookmarked for months and needed a good reason to check them out. Hungry!

Ordered the habanero and serrano laced El Diablo Burger and a side order of their delicious Green Chili Queso Fries. The burger was very fresh and tasty and those dang fries were mouth watering. That green chili sauce was so good that I could just drink it in a shake.

There are also several other meat group choices on the menu besides Beef. You can choose from Tuna, Bison, Lamb, Turkey, Chicken and a few others to make your tummy rumble. They even have some good looking Salads for those of you that are looking for some fiber.

Service was friendly and the inside was very comfortable. There is a large full bar in the middle of the eating area and they also have a nice patio area for those who love the outdoors.

Looking forward to coming back again and trying out some other items on their tasty menu. Might even twist my arm and go for one of those locally brewed craft beers.

Come on over and give them a shout out. I got lucky today and there was no wait for a table. This place could easily get crazy during peak eating hours. BURGER TIME!

4 Stars"}
{"text":"Loved the menu options!  I'm not a burger person, but I got the Thunderbird chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  They've got a nice selection of mixed drinks and beer, and I loved the green chili queso.  I thought this place was packed when we got there, but when we left the line out the door was even longer!  Despite how busy they were, the line did move at a fairly good pace.  And you walk by the bar so you can order a drink while you're waiting in line.  To continue with what was good about this place, after we were seated with our food, our server came around frequently to refill drinks and such.  Also, being as I was pregnant and couldn't indulge in one of the delicious-looking cocktails, I indulged in a Raspberry White Chocolate shake... mmm.

The \"cons\" I had are more \"FYI\" as they don't reflect poorly on the restaurant itself.  It's more of a \"know your venue\" type of thing.  Tip #1: This place is not the best for large groups, especially during busy times (a fact they even warn you about on their website).  It's just not set up for it.  We had a group of 8 of us, and did actually manage to get tables next to each other, but that was pretty lucky and it was still hard to have a conversation with anyone other than those at your immediate table (the tables don't push together so each table is spaced apart from the others).  Tip #2: This place is not toddler-friendly.  Or even really kid-friendly.  For several reasons.  First, you have to stand in line to order (which can be a long line if they're busy).  Never fun to stand in a narrow, crowded line with a toddler.  Second, they have no kids menu.  Not that your kids can't eat off the adult menu, but the burgers are a little pricey to get one just for your kid.  Come prepared to share, I guess.  And third, there's no real seating for kids.  Tables are high up, and not set up for either high chairs or booster seats.  Possibly the tables outside could work with a high chair, if they even have them (I didn't ask, since there was no point with our indoor tables.  I mean, those tables were tall!)

Again, I want to re-iterate that those things are not \"bad\" things!  I mean, they were unfortunate for me and my large party with toddlers, but that's our fault for not picking a more family-friendly restaurant, and not Hopdoddy's fault.  If you're a couple with a young baby, or a family with older children, great!  Bring your kiddos!  But if you've got a large group or small children, be forewarned."}
{"text":"Back at the bar for dinner last night, and it was fantastic!  Just Classic Burgers with Fries and a stout for supper, but Owen behind the bar made the experience even better!  Efficient, friendly, funny, and engaging, he made the night!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my visit to this place. I ordered a salted Carmel shake that tasted like a pumpkin nutmeg shake. My server brought the check over to me and I paid with a $20, he then brought me back my change but just the bills. I had to ask for the receipt to check my change, sure enough he kept the 48 cents. This place is super shady and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Round 2 for Hopdoddy.
This is our second trip to hopdoddy. I was trying to manage expectations. After all, how could that $10 for a gourmet burger and craft beer deal still be going? How could they possibly serve up another perfect burger by my outrageous standards? Wouldn't I give up and move on if the line was too long? Our 2nd time around was a GRAND SLAM! We found 2 seats at the bar and had our drinks and food within 20 minutes. Be Advised. The line was out the door but don't be intimidated. I timed the order line and it took 7 minutes for one couple to reach the order stand and their food was served 16 minutes later (creepy I know)."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!

My first time at Hopdoddy was for lunch on a weekday... second time, Sunday brunch.

Great atmosphere and casual feel. Full bar and a variety of seating. You place an order at the counter and a runner brings you your food. The best part? You can customize just about everything! I ordered the la Bandita both times with a turkey burger instead of black bean. SO GOOD! 

Great low-key lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Food: Ahi tuna burger = 4 stars (this is extremely high on my scale) 
Service = 5 stars (courteous, attentive, warm, and considerate)
Ambiance = 4 stars (simple but warm)
Price = 5 stars (affordable and great bang for your bucks!)"}
{"text":"Favorite burger in Scottsdale! 

We just moved here from Cleveland and were a little spoiled with having several really good burger joints around the city.  Hopdoddy absolutely makes the cut out here in AZ! Perfectly cooked burgers, buns that don't take over the burger, great taste, delicious truffle fries, and awesome milkshakes (red velvet was our choice).  

The space works well.  You first build your burger, then find a table and it will be served to you. We went on a Friday night and arrived a little early since we had kids in tow, shortly after we were seated there was a line out the door. Be prepared for a bit of a line, but it seemed to move quickly.  

A must try spot if you are in search of a great burger!"}
{"text":"Ok I have to give it the 5 Stars, our burgers, The Primetime & The Magic Shroom, were cooked right (mid rare) this time, everything was perfect. We are not dessert people (especially with a pastry chef in the house) but we're convinced to try a shake so we got the Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel shake and it was really good, not too sweet it was great with the little bits of crunch thru out. Definitely worth trying again. I appreciate the management inviting us back after our boy so great experience the last time, it was great. Also our waiter, Hashem was really awesome attentive and very nice. Look forward to next time."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar, is the best burger joint in town! At 25 miles away from my home and almost a 45 minute drive I still can't wait to go again! My first visit was a Yelptastic experience, in which I was fortunate to be able to taste several types of burgers and chicken too but it was definitely the Ahi tuna that made me return. I'd been bragging to the guys, my son and daughter's boyfriend how good this place is, and what guy doesn't enjoy a burger so of course I brought them to taste for themselves! We chose the pablano, a bison and the Ahi tuna along with some of their amazing fries. We ordered a couple of their In-House flavored fountain sodas, the Rootbeer and the Blueberry. I am a Diet Coke drinker perhaps even an addict but the Blueberry soda had me hooked at the first sip! To my heartbreak I was told after I had ordered that the last of the Ahi tuna had been sold,choose another burger and perhaps they'd be able to get more tuna in. Crushed and forced to choose again I went with the Diablo Burger. This little spicy number set my tastebuds on fire with heat and great flavor.The manager soon came over and apologized for the tuna shortage and went out of his way to make it up to us. Fabulous food and customer to match, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
The blonde male bartender may be the nicest guy in the place, all around
Burgers and fries came out in a timely manner
Burgers were well cooked and yummy
Above bartender was great to assist us when we had no server
Great atmosphere 

Cons:
Really poor service from \"servers\" regarding clearing our plates, we really had no server at all
Having to physically wave down someone for refills
Slow afternoon, so a million servers and no service. 

Overall, I like this place, the bartenders saved us and were great in taking care of us, let me taste different beers and had great suggestions for a blonde beer. I think it would be a fun place to hang out on a Friday night for drinks and some food. I'll go again as my grandparents said their previous experience was great."}
{"text":"I love hot! But the diablo burger was a little out of hand.... lol! It was totally inedible! I will be back to try a burger but this one never! The guy next to me got the same burger and neither one of us could eat it."}
{"text":"Ok i would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the HORRENDOUS NAME, i mean its just awful and I'm almost embarrassed attempting to repeat it to others as they respond with a 'huh, whats it called?' And if restaurants succeed by word of mouth the name of this place just kills it as id imagine once someone's hears of this place they forget it about 5 seconds later as its not something that would really stick in your mind. Or as my boyfriend said 'oh what i thought this place was called hop daddy this whole time'. Moving on from the name however this place does have AMAZING burgers (not hot dogs as one might naturally think by the name). Its definitely worth trying, yes they are expensive for a burger place but the meal is really worth every penny and this isn't just some ordinary burger joint. I would find it hard to believe anyone would be disappointed when leaving here."}
{"text":"Very good service but it feels like the palce needs a little longer time to settle in and some improvement of the food! Had Buffalo Blue burger, fries and Salty caramel shake!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Good burgers, fries and a nice selection of unique natural \"Maine\" sodas. The root beer is amazing. I have eaten the Llano Poblano and the Goodnight burger (minus the bbq sauce) and both were outstanding. They grind their own meat, bake their own buns, and support local and small farmers. The first visit my burger was a little under done for my taste so I order well-done now. I think if you don't specify it will be a little red/bloody just fyi. 
They do have some daily specials and some happy hour (2-6pm or so) specials. Not sure if they have a kids menu but they do make some yummy looking shakes! Try it out, I think you will like it."}
{"text":"First time trying this location in Phoenix. We tried it in Dallas TX a couple of years a go and loved it. We are so glad they came to Phoenix. Hurrray!  The food was just like we had it the first time.  I had the magic shroom burger  my husband had the llano poblano and we shared the Parmesan truffle fries. The Angus beef patty was cook medium rear and the combination of the condiments was a tasy perfection brewing in my mouth.  My eldest son had the classic burger with cheese and an Oreo milk shake. My youngest had the continental club with a stout chocolate shake and they both shared an order of the kennebec fries. Needles to say we all walked out with a smile.
As for the service, it was AWESOME right from the start we were greeted and assisted in the process. Throughout dinner we were asked if we need anything else.  If you haven't tried it stop by."}
{"text":"Great food at great price.  Loved the Schroom burger and the fries!"}
{"text":"A few local-ish brews does not a \"hop\" name require. Nice little beer selection,  but I thought I was getting more. About a dozen different beers on tap. 
Burgers are good,  but the only thing separating them from a chain \"fancy\"  burger joints (think \"just less than half a dozen fellas\") is a variety of toppings,  a long line and some pretense."}
{"text":"I think if the walk up counter was gone this place would do a lot better. Waiting in line was not too fun. The person in front of us had a larger modified ticket and was totally annoying to listen to..we  did tip the counter staff and server. We were approached too many times asking if everything was \"good\" . Burgers were good but first basket of fries was a pile of crumbs. For $6 a basket, there should be fries not crumbs. They were replaced fast but the guy did look offended. I think the service staff really reallyyyy wanted to make a impression so they would get tipped. ( kinda like a buffet, servers hope they get something ) Six plus times asking if something was \"good \" was overboard. I think if it was just a regular restaurant without the counter it would keep
The servers more busy and they would not be stressing if someone was going to tip or not. I do not like being interrupted every bite I take lol. 

Burgers were good so don't worry on that part!"}
{"text":"Delicious and large portions! Small franchise burger joint with a full bar, they have two locations in Phoenix metro. We went to the Scottsdale location to meet up with friends for lunch and came hungry but left satisfied. Don't be deceived if you have little ones when you see the tall bar height table and chairs. They have high chairs and portable high chairs that latch to the table end. Very accommodating for a big family. Ambiance is loud, decor and style is modern, and great curb appeal from outside. I tried one of the recommended burgers by the hostess and it was delicious. If you have a sweet tooth like me, try the Nutella pretzel milkshake with your meal."}
{"text":"We came here the first weekend it opened and the line was so long. We decided to eat dinner somewhere else and try it for lunch. 

There was still a line for lunch, but definitely not as bad as dinner. I was a little confused for a while, I wish they had a bigger menu in front of the line on a board where we can look at or something. While we were in line, they didn't have enough menus for people to look at -- by the time we got to the counter, we were still a little unsure of what to order. 

We ordered the mushroom burger and the ahi tuna burger with a side of truffle fries. I also got the salted caramel shake which is actually really good! The food was actually very tasty! It's this fast casual service that's kinda turning me off. I'd still come back though for lunch! I'm curious to try the other burgers!"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with Hopdoddy, surely one of the best burgers in town. We moved from Texas one year ago and knew the place from previous visits to both Dallas and Austin locations. My wife and I were commenting how much we missed our Friday night Hopdoddy's trips, and I decided to check the Phoenix area for \"best burgers\". What a pleasant surprise to find out Hopdoddy not only was there but easily accessible in Phoenix! As proud Texans, we can say the Phoenix location lives up to the Hopdoddy name. Friendly staff, the same old fresh ingredients burger. Don't forget to try Terlingua or El Diablo for an amazingly spicy experience."}
{"text":"In regards to burger joints in this price range ($8-14) this is my favorite. My husband orders the Llano Poblano which is an all beef burger, applewood bacon, pepper jack, seared poblanos and a Chipotle aioli. It's got a nice kick without being too much. I order the ahi tuna burger without teriyaki sauce and on a whole wheat bun. The tuna is accompanied by sprouts, honey wasabi and nori chips. The nori chips provide a nice crunch and the sprouts provide a freshness that I love. Personally, I wouldn't order the bun this comes with. With the whole wheat bun, you are eating a burger without feeling terribly guilty. On the unhealthy side, their fries are so good! They also make their own dressings and sauces which go perfectly. 

If you like beer, they serve craft beers in huge frozen goblets. Every time I go I have to grab a beer because of the frosty delightfulness. 

Writing about this restaurant makes me want to go get my ahi tuna burger and beer now. I cannot wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give five star is the setting is on busy Scottsdale Road but it is still nice sitting outside and having a beer and burger . Great food and drinks. Aporeciate you can upgrade to grass fed beef. Fun selection of drinks.   Great happy hour. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Definitely the best burger in the Valley.  

This is what a burger should taste like.  I have already been 3 times, and every burger has been delicious.  The Goodnight, has a great flavor, with sweet caramelized onions, fresh jalapenos, to kick it up a notch, with their secret sassy sauce.  The Terlingua is the preeminent chili cheese burger, with great tasting chile con carne, and  a few fritos to add another texture.  Probably my favorite so far has been the Primetime, with Texas japanese beef, truffle aioli, and caramelized onions.  

The fries are great as well, whether you get the regular fries or the truffle fries.  Fresh cut and fried and well seasoned.  

Don't miss the shakes either, I tried the Red Velvet shake, and there were chunks of cake throughout the shake.  

The soda fountain is loaded with Maine Root soda.  They are far superior to what you get with a Pepsi or Coke product, plus they are all made with cane sugar.  I can't get enough of both the Root Beer and Cream Soda.

The ordering system is a bit different, but it allows quick service once you place your order.  It will get quicker as people get used to how it works.  Still not sure what to think of the tipping system.  The servers bring you your food, and refill your drinks, but it isn't full service, so not sure what a fair tip is.

People who say the food isn't that good don't know good food.  Everything is made fresh, expertly prepared, and served hot."}
{"text":"Tried  for the first time . My daughter  picked the place . It is very casual  . The menu is similar  to zinburger. Their is a line to order which was slow . The meals took about 20 minutes  but the Diablo burger was good  and spicy fresh harbeneros. Fries were plenty.  Also tried the shake which was good . Only complaint  was the time . Server keep coming by often. There is tables  outside  which accommodates pets. I will  be back"}
{"text":"The Magic Shroom burger I ordered was delicious - juicy, cooked exactly to my liking (medium), and well-seasoned. Though I'm not a big fan of thin cut fries because restaurants that serve these tend to overcook them, the Kennebec fries I got as a side were  very good: crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Before coming here, I looked at the beer list on the website of their Scottsdale location and made my choice; unfortunately this Phoenix location has a different list, so I chose a different brew than what I was hoping to get. Hopefully they'll eventually follow the Scottsdale location's example and print a beer list that indicates the ABV (alcohol by volume) and IBU (International Bitterness Units); I find that helpful in making a choice of brew for ordering. Atmosphere is very casual and service is fast and friendly. The Town and Country location means that this burger bar is easy to find and get to, and parking will never be a problem."}
{"text":"Expect Friendly service here!  It's a bit different, you order your food & have a seat, they will bring you your food.  The Parmesan fries were delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped here about 8 pm on a Friday.  It was not too crowded but it was yummy!  I had the kobe hamburger with brie - sooooo good.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not the right one for this restaurant I was extremely disappointed with their service and their food didn't make up for it...and their fries just are the best 
I ordered a burger with cheese and bacon they gave me the smallest piece of bacon ever their prices are very reasonable for their food"}
{"text":"I don't think I've had anything here I don't like. Always consistently good food. I like their sodas, and their burgers are awesome. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It is an interesting atmosphere here. It's relaxed and bar like and loud. The burgers are delicious and the shakes are too. I had the ahi tuna burger on wheat. It was very interesting and amazing! The pretzel Nutella shake is also very good. It has chunks of chocolate covered pretzel in the bottom. The servers were very nice but we hardly ever saw our own server so we had to ask others who passed by our table for help."}
{"text":"The menu is confusing.  Place was.  Busy.. service was a little  slow. I liked their El Diablo  . Fries were a little  cool . We tried their shakes which has was average.  We had different  servers . Price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Menu is a little  confusing, we ordered but the meal took about 20 minutes, hamburger was good but fries were overcooked , disappointed, the servers were attentive  but did not apologize  for the wait"}
{"text":"Although there was nothing wrong with our meal it was nothing memorable. The burgers taste fresh, we got the \"Goodnight Good cause\" burger and \"Thunderbird\" chicken burger. The green chile queso fries were odd, the fries were not crunchy even though they were freshly baked, and the queso was soupy. I asked if the queso was supposed to be so watery and I guess it is. 
The service set up doesnt make sense, you walk in they tell you where youre gonna sit, you go order your butger at the counter then take a seat. The fountain drinks are self serve but you also have a waiter . The experience felt broken up , all that said everyone working here was attentive and provided excellent service. 
Will probably not return."}
{"text":"Hopdoddys is by far my favorite place to get a burger. Although I live far from both locations, it's definitely worth a trip to get some great food. This location in particular has great interior and also located in an awesome location in Biltmore. I tried the Impossible Burger here and it was a surprise to find that it was nicely prepared. Everytime I've taken a new friend here, they are impressed! It never fails! I recommend getting parmesan garlic fries with a side of chili to dip. Overall, I've been to Hopdoddy countless times and I get the same excitement  ready to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible! You would think that a place that prides themselves from being from Texas would have top quality meat. Not the case at this place. Save your money."}
{"text":"First of all -- the burgers are phenomenal.  No other burger has the flavor, texture, seasonings, and done-ness than Hop-Doddy.  But the most fantastic part of eating here is the staff. Whatever magic the owners perform to hire, train and manage these folks should be shared with the world.  The staff are all extremely professional and they seem to love their jobs, their work with customers and their support of each other.  Absolutely great to experience.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy."}
{"text":"The burgers were very good and fairly priced though with no sides. If this were a normal restaurant that would bring me back.  The beer selection was adequate. Although at least one other review complained about only having Arizona beers I thought that was a strength. The problem is that this isn't a normal restaurant. There are elaborate procedures to line you up, educate you on how to order, identify a table, then order at a cash register, then get your own condiments and soft drinks or water then carry your drinks, etc to the table. Tipping is expected though no service was provided except taking an order and identifying a table.  From there it is full service. The only service I can think of other than food and alcoholic beverages already ordered at the cashier would have been a second drink but we had our food shortly after beverages so didn't need another or dessert which wasn't needed. The waitress seemed nice and did check back. Something else which bothered me is that silverware is not provided except a steak knife and there are no napkins, just paper towels. So great burgers, good beers, complicated self serve systems and no table setting. I like restaurants. This doesn't meet my desires. I am not sure how mobility challenged customers could do it. I couldn't bring my wife. But good burgers..."}
{"text":"Omgosh best burger in town. By far. The milkshakes are to die for. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great and the service was excellent. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Hopdoddy, and really hope they expand throughout the valley. My first time here was at a tasting event sponsored by Yelp, I was able to taste most of what was on the menu including their burgers, salads, shakes and cocktails. I went in expecting this place to be good, since I'm a huge fan of their sister restaurant Salty Sow and it definitely met my expectations. 

The setup makes your dining experience very easy and laid back. You walk in and order at the counter. Don't worry if the line is too long, the servers will come around with samples to make up for it. Once you order your seat will be assigned to you, and your food will be served to you there. If you want anything else such as more drinks or dessert you can order it from your server. This process makes for a very relaxed dining experience. 

As for the food, my favorites are the ahi tuna burger. The burger has sushi grade tuna with a delicious wasabi sauce and crunchy sprouts. If you like fish this is a must try! Even though this is a burger place, I really love their Hail Caesar salad. This is a modern take on the traditional caesar as it includes crunchy fried chickpeas, potato hay and a delicious dressing. I absolutely love their Parmesan truffle fries, it's worth coming here for these alone! The fries are full of flavor with truffle oil, parmesan and garlic and comes with an amazing aioli type dipping sauce.

Another added plus is all of their awesome drink options. They have a soda fountain that includes all types of fun flavors such as blueberry and cream soda. They also offer plenty of local craft beer options, and I haven't had a cocktail that I didn't like. My favorite is their version of the Jon Daily which is called the Soco Sweet Tea, if you like Arnold Palmers this is the cocktail for you! Hopdoddy is a welcome addition to the Phoenix area, the only downside is that's it's a little far from where I live. However it's still worth the drive and won't stop me from returning."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour specials.  Good food and beer selection.  Had both veggie burger and the pablano  pepper burger and both were great."}
{"text":"Had the Pablo burger.  It was so good along with regular fries and creme soda to wash it down with.  Definitely recommend this place to any burger lover."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, and really enjoyed our experience!
Our waitress was great- provided just enough attention without being too much. There really is a fine line, amiright? And she was awesome! When we asked for ketchup she brought us approximately 700 little cups of it, cause you can never have too much. I like a little bit of fry with my ketchup, if you catch my drift.
The food was phenomenal. Truffle Fries were lit. Huge portion! More than enough for two people. 
I had the Shroom burger and I'm still dreaming about it. The combination of beef, mushrooms, goat cheese, and basil pesto was just heavenly. They really know what they're doing to build a perfect burger. My lunch date had very specific request for hers (yeah she's one of THOSE ;) and they were happy to abide the substitutions/additions and it came out perfectly. 
We'll definitely be back for more ketchup, I mean food !!!
If you don't want to get messy, maybe don't come here. If your pants are already too tight, maybe don't come here- or at least be prepared to pop the first button. If you want amazing burgers, fries, and service (and you're comfortable rocking a food baby for the rest of the afternoon) I would highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent burgers, and assortment of drinks.  

We had the Buffalo Burger which was incredible.  They used Franks hot sauce on it with blue cheese plus very fresh tomatoes.  There fries were great too.  You can order a large fry and it'll feed three folks no problem.  

Also noteworthy, you can mix up their Maine based soda drinks to create different flavors.  Their staff can provide some recommendations on those.  

Definitely worth visiting for a good burger if you're a local or just visiting the area."}
{"text":"We are from Vegas which is full of five-star gourmet restaurants, and there is no shortage of famous chef's burger restaurants! Before Hop Daddy, holstein's burger restaurant at the cosmopolitan hotel was the best burger place I've been to, but tonight that all changed. Hop daddy was the best burger I've ever had. I have celiac disease and they were very accommodating. I had the magic mushroom burger on a gluten-free bun, with Parmesan truffle fries. They filled out an allergy ticket, and took all the precautions to make sure that my food wasn't contaminated.

The truffle fries were also excellent. We also didn't have the typical order from the counter experience. We sat at the bar which is full service, the bartender takes your order and brings the food right to you."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a work conference, saw this spot so a few of us decided to check it out. The place and concept is very posh, trendy and unique on its own. 

First thing that drew my attention were the \"handcrafted\" fountain sodas. They don't have coke or Pepsi products which I though was really cool I tried the vanilla cream and it was delicious! They also have a full bar right in the center of the restaurant so I think this would be a cool spot for after work or just to grab a drink. It's very casual and relaxed! Not sure if they have a happy hour but I would imagine they do?!?

Its a order first then sit down at a table type thing. They deliver your food to your table based on a number they give out. It really didn't take that long for our food to come out, the friea came out way before the burgers which is new for me. I guess I usually think that burgers and fries are served/eaten together.  They have truffle fries OMG, get them!!

I had the ahi tuna burger, which was seared in both sides and served with domain lettuce, red onion and tomato. Best part was the terriyaki glaze and wasabi cream spread that came with it. Wasabi sauce was pretty hot though so be careful. 

Only thing is they are a little pricey for what it is, then again they are in Scottsdale so I guess the prices are comparable."}
{"text":"Can't get enough. Service is awesome and the food incredible!  Love the triple B. This place is a must!!"}
{"text":"You're assigned seating after you order your food, extremely strange concept. We had a large party meeting us but we arrived early, meaning everyone would've been assigned seats in different areas. No thank you...let me just tell YOU where we'll be sitting. Other than that, food was basic and forgettable."}
{"text":"Good food, poor method of service.

We got here at 6:02pm, stood in line (think cafeteria style) for an hour before we were able to order. Normally my gf and I would have a beer while waiting. During the hour wait, no water or beer available. 

I love the food, but hate the way to order. Most places we can order, get the food and leave in an hour.  I'm not the in the rush person, but an hour to order then get your food 13 minutes later, I'll pass on this place next time."}
{"text":"Food was good, not
Necessarily something I would go out of my way for but it was good. Food took quite awhile and people that ordered after us got
Their food before us which was slightly irritating. Also, they ask you how you want your burger cooked but don't cook it that way, so what's the point of asking? I would go again but like I said I wouldn't go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Best place in town , just open today , fries are awesome , any burger you grab is the best, you can't go wrong , they start in Austin Texas and moving down to Los Angeles can't wait"}
{"text":"My first comment: can you get a real kids menu? Just even if you print it on toilet paper-or anything. Just anywhere.
I went with my kids (cause yelp says it's kid friendly!), and when I asked if they had burgers for kids, the lady at the register told me they could do grilled cheese or order the classic burger with just the patty (it comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato etc). Same size burger as the adult burger, same price, just 50% less stuff. Hmmmmm.
Not asking to reinvent the wheel here, just saying. I looked around on a Saturday afternoon and there were a good amount of kids.

Overall the burgers were good. Obviously I ate a lot of left overs from my kids. (I hate throwing good food away.....)
I had the Caesar salad (not necessarily low cal) with grass fed beef. It was delicious.
Truffle fries were on par with the regular fries if you ask me. They only come in one size (large).....

It's a bit confusing walking in, where do you order, can't read the menu properly, wait, how do we get a table. But besides that-Def will come again. The burgers are great."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times since they opened. 1st time was amazing, shared the classic, truffle fries, and sea salt shake. Second time was sub par, the poblano burger was great but lacked a little something, the truffle fries were terrible and the same shake was super runny. Thought it might be a fluke so we went there again yesterday. Just ordered the shake and it was again super runny. Everyone else liked their burgers but the fries left something to be desired. I hope they figure out the whole shake bit and get something rolling with their fries."}
{"text":"The food and drinks at Hopdoddy are top-notch. I had the Classic Burger, Parmesan Aioli fries and a PV tea (a cocktail similar to a Raspberry Arnold Palmer). So delicious and such a creative menu. I could come back tons of times and probably never get bored. They even have grass-fed meat and composting bins. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they are trying to be local and eco-conscious. More restaurants should be like this.
The only reason for knocking off a star is for an unfair reason. I DID volunteer to sit at the bar (which is full-service where the rest of the restaurant is fast-casual style). It ended up being a bad choice, because I was right on the edge where all of the other customers are waiting in line, and some rather inconsiderate folk took it upon themselves to lean up against the bar, practically putting their elbows in my food. 
Of course, this is not Hopdoddy's fault. Some people are just blind to the situations around them."}
{"text":"Magic Mushroom burger FTW! So yummy! Great tasting meat and fresh veggies on the burger.  Must have FRIES!"}
{"text":"Service and food both so so good! Came here for the first time with my boyfriend and we were really surprised by how friendly they are. Even though the menu is a little intimidating they totally don't make you feel rushed or stupid for asking questions. My boyfriend can't have gluten and ordered a gluten free bun which they were out of so they offered us a free shake (which was delicious) and all of the staff really works as a team to make sure customers are well taken care of!"}
{"text":"We loved it so much we went back for more.  Great food and beer.  
Please do something about the awkward and confusing method of getting a table.  We waited in a huge line while there were many open tables the entire time. 
Not reserved for anyone either.  Maybe waiting for parties of 4-6? We finally stood in line by the bar and ordered beers (nice), but had to pay the tab then.  Three people ahead of us we order or food and have to pay again for food and additional drinks.   This could be improved."}
{"text":"Went tonight on crutches after knee surgery they wouldn't accommodate me at all. Would not allow me to sit down in order I had to stand in line to place my order. Coming up the ramp and it's blocked by a sunshade so I couldn't get through. This place needs to be re-evaluated for their accessibility and I don't believe the requirements. I am so disappointed! I really hope management takes this review to heart and teaches their staff how to have some compassion for handicapped people."}
{"text":"I knew going in, the ordering system might be a little bit of a C.F., but it actually wasn't too bad.  There was a friendly young woman by the entrance guiding the flow of traffic and she gave us a menu and pointed us toward the register.  We were there around noon on a Saturday.  We ordered with no problems and I suffered from mild sticker shock, but nothing obscene.  Two burgers, the truffle fries, and 2 beers were $39.67 before tip.

We shared the Thunderbird chicken sandwich, the truffle fries, and the Magic Shroom burger plus bacon (of course).  Mr. M had a Oak Creek Nut Brown and I tried Four Peaks' Peach ale.  

When I ordered my sandwich I knew it had poblano peppers and chipotle mayo on it and thought for a split second that it might be a little too spicy for my taste, but actually, it had very little flavor at all.  Kind of shocking.  The grilled chicken breast was good quality and moist, but that sandwich was completely bland.

The truffle fries were just ok.  They were soaked with the oil, soggy, and not really that appealing.  Mr. M's shroom burger was the real winner.  The blend of flavors of good quality beef, mushrooms, bacon, and pesto was perfect!  I would definitely get that again.  

Service overall was really top notch and everyone was very friendly.  Our server Riley had several tables and she was hustling and smiling the whole time.  I didn't care for the techno music and all the rabid children.  When we were finished we asked ourselves if we would come back and we both said maybe.  

If I were to return I'd definitely just sit at the bar and for sure get the shroom burger again.  I read that happy hour pricing is pretty good too, so if I do return and have a better experience I'll be sure to update my review, but for now it's just A-OK to us."}
{"text":"Awesome place, friendly people, delicious food. I love their Nutella shake my favorite yummmmy. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"While the milkshakes and margaritas were remarkable, the service set up was not. You get a number for a table and then you get in line to order your food, but when you finally go back to your table you have a waiter for additional drinks. I don't enjoy having two tabs in two different transactions.

The food was great, the mini margs fantastic, but I don't think I will be going back again to meet friends unless the whole party is already with me."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! I had the El Diablo with chicken, can't wait to go back! The bartender Marshall was great too"}
{"text":"We decided to try the burgers based on word of mouth and the reviews on yelp while vacationing here in scottsdale. My husband ordered the diablo and I had the Llano poblano.  Both were delicious. The beef is hormone/antibiotic free. The burgers are made with fresh ingredients and are full of flavour. The buns are baked on site. Overall a great burger experience. Our kids ordered the classic and split it- but didn't finish their burgers. They are picky eaters so we didn't expect these gourmet burgers to be a hit with them. At least it was happy hour (before 6pm on monday) so their burger and fries and drink was about $9. We also ordered the truffle parm fries. So good but too much to finish."}
{"text":"Incredible, unique burgers! Best fries east of San Francisco! LOVE this place. Beer is fantastic as well. Will always come back here."}
{"text":"So, was back in town and chose to eat here again because it was close. This time I got the Diablo, no tomato or salsa (salsa is chunky, like pico, and I don't really dig chunky fresh tomato). Regardless of the tomato, this burger was awesome. Didn't get much habanero, but lots of serano, which is one of my faves. Blazin' burger... Word of warning to those that don't like really spicy stuff...

Sat at the bar, Service was great. I like this place. Funny though, they have 2 of these within close proximity of each other. It's an Austin establishment and they only open one in Houston... In the midtown area. Let's get one in Clear Lake."}
{"text":"Unique experience! Must try the truffle fries- I'd go back just for those! I ordered the Thunderbird- chicken BURGER which was slightly hard to eat, the pablano peppers kept sliding out. It was EXCELLENT other than that. Highly recommend. We got the continental club as well, also very delicious.  You walk in and order at the kitchen window, which was a little jarring at first because it was not busy and we had never been there, so as we took some time to look at the menu it felt like the entire cook line was watching us. We didn't like that so much, but the wait staff was very friendly about it. They assign you a table at the time you order, and you don't have to pay until after your meal. Great time, we will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. My food was cold and the staff didn't seem to care. Bad vibes everywhere, the workers gave me dirty looks and we're clearly talking crappie behind my back. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"The food was great. Atmosphere was lovely. Bartender cute. Try the green chili queso and fries."}
{"text":"I've been able to sample a good cross section of the menu - but it's the ahi burger that keeps me coming back. 
Sushi-Grade Tuna, Sprouts, Teriyaki, Honey Wasabi, Nori Chips, Pickled Ginger - this is one of the most incredible sandwiches I've ever had. It's downright ahigasmic! ;)
The fries are delicious, strong selection of beers and decent cocktails.
It's not cheap - but definitely a good add to the upgraded fast casual market."}
{"text":"This is by far the best burger in town! I love it.
Went in today for dinner and El Diablo is the BEST! 
Ryan helped us and OMG, what a cutie! Looks way too young to be working but what amazes me the most is the customer service! Wow, truly make you feel like they care and are so super friendly! 
Thanks Ryan you are adorable! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"The burger was good. I had a classic cheeseburger. First off, they don't take your order. You place your order at the counter. A young lady brought me my food who was not my \"server\". I asked her for condiments which she brought right back for me. She was also the one who cleared the table. My \"server\" was totally useless and did nothing besides walk by and ask if it was good. I did tipped him because I don't stiff people, but he was terrible. The girl running food out should have gotten the tip. I even had to have someone hunt down my server so i could pay to get out of there. I'm not sure why there is a line for tipping on the bill or why you just don't pay at the counter when ordering. That's pretty lame. The service was great from the person who wasn't my server and it was a really good burger, but not sure about repeating, which is the name of the game."}
{"text":"\"You know what the valley really needs?  Another burger joint\" - no one ever.  I'm not picking on Hopdoddy I promise, but c'mon we know the valley is as oversaturated with burger joints as we are with pizza joints, taco stands, and coffee shops.  But being the devoted and resolutely curious Yelper foodie I am, I can't let a new buzz-generating joint escape my view (even if it is just a burger joint).  I've actually missed numerous opportunities to try Hopdoddy in the past (including their original location in Austin years back), but my Dad asked for a burger joint to meet up at for dinner.  So on early Saturday evening, Hopdoddy it was.

Hopdoddy is pretty hard to miss in the Town & Shopping shopping complex.  On the southeast corner of 20th Street & Camelback, Hopdoddy's Phoenix location pretty demonstrably stands out from the old red tile roof row structures next door.  Hopdoddy's two story window encased structure is an odd mix with the rest of the plaza, but the laid back atmosphere inside will quickly disarm the confused.  The ordering process here is a little different than other burger joints however.  Here you're handed a menu, study it while waiting in line and then order at the register.  Being that there was no line Saturday at 5pm, my Dad and I had to act quickly.  Fortunately it didn't take me long to land on my preferred meal of the night.

First, the burger.  In this case the appropriately named Primetime Burger.  American Kobe style beef, brie cheese, caramelized onions, truffle aioli, steak sauce, arugula and tomato.  Yelpers also raved about the truffle fries so I split a large order of those with my Dad.  And because I'm a sucker for shakes, gotta have one of those.  I had a delicious salted caramel milk shake at The Stand in Arcadia not long ago I figured I'd see how Hopdoddy's compares.  Total cost for my food, shake and tax came to about $28 and was all brought to our table in just under 5 minutes.

The salted caramel shake here was solid, though not quite as rich and creamy as The Stand's version.  Still, a perfectly good shake I can recommend.  The truffle fries came out in a huge portion and liberally doused with parmesan cheese.  The aioli coating was present but not overwhelming which I appreciated.  As for the burger, it was good (especially liked the fresh baked bun), but the sandwich itself didn't blow me away.  I think it was probably the brie cheese that threw me off a bit on this one.  I might've gone with cheddar, blue cheese, or even mozzarella as a substitute.  The burger itself was great and the onions and steak sauce were excellent accompaniments.

So not perfect, but a really good overall first experience at Hopdoddy.  Given their commitment to fresh made bread, scratch made sauces, and keeping hormones and antibiotics out of the beef, I can understand why this Austin born burger chain has taken off.  And for you veggie lovers out there, there are salads as well as a black bean burger option.  Is Hopdoddy good enough to stand up the mountain of burger competitors in the valley?  Time will tell.  But I thinks it safe to say we'll be seeing more Hopdoddy locations popping up in the valley before long."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a fun environment, the bar has good options and I personally love that their is a burger that donates money to charity (its called the goodnight, SO YUMMY) I also cant go to this place without getting a milkshake! I would recommend Hopdoddy to anyone looking for good food and good people!"}
{"text":"Wow. Now that's what I call a burger joint. You got your choice of meat, rather it be beef, ahi tuna, or bison. Not to mention that you get to choose rather to have gluten-free buns or regular buns-both look amazing. What really set this place apart from any burger joints that I've been to in the past is that they offer a wide selection of beer to your meal. I ended up getting the Summer Road Trip by a Brewery Company from Flagstaff called \"Mother Road Brewery\". All their burgers are delicious. If you love spicy foods, I'd recommend the El Diablo Burger. SO MUCH HEAT AND FLAVOR! And what good would it be without their signature Parmesan Fries? One last thing, they offer four different condiments for the fries. ALL OF THEM ARE AWESOME! If I could, I would give this place a 6/5. Definitely check these guys out if your in Scottsdale, Arizona."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks but whoever came up with the ordering  system needs to be publicly flogged. I've been there 4 times and had an issue every time. Stand in line, someone's sitting at your table, who do you tip. Was the server, customer set up not working? When you reinvent the wheel it better be better than what you replaced. In spite of this I keep going back because everything else is great."}
{"text":"So here is the thing with this place, you go up and order your food and get your drinks like you would at Subway or Five Guys. There is a condiments island so you can get your ketchup and sauces for your fries and the take them to your table. When you sit down though you get a server. What I don't get is that I already did everything so what is this person going to do for me. There is a food runner who brings the food, I already got my drink and ordered from the guy at the register. So basically I'm now obligated to tip this guy for bringing me the check. It's not about the $3-$5 it's about how it makes no sense and is really more of an inconvenience. The burgers and salads are really good so if you can get past the awkward and basically useless server then it's not a bad spot."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Clean environment and bathroom. Food was fresh and cooked perfectly. I thought for the price you're getting a great burger. I thought the shakes were the best ever."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a vegan-friendly restaurant and stumbled across Hopdoddy because they serve the Impossible burger. The restaurant has a really cool vibe with both indoor and outdoor seating. There are plenty of burger options -- two of which are vegan. The staff is extremely friendly and were really helpful at helping me decide what to eat. Their service is a bit of hybrid setup where you order at the counter, but wait staff come around to deliver food and reorder any drinks. We were both very satisfied with the different burgers we ordered!"}
{"text":"So apparently ketchup has now become a precious commodity that you have to specifically ask for when ordering fries in your to-go order through any food delivery app... umm, what?

My friend and I just ordered burgers from Hopdoddy, as well as two orders of French fries from a food delivery app -- for quite the pretty penny -- and no ketchup, dipping sauces, or napkins. I guess we're supposed to eat it bland, then wipe our hands on our clothes? Thanks, I think. 

The burgers are pretty good... I mean the typical burger, but nothing over-the-top extravagant where you should pay so much for a burger. But when you're hungry, pricing tends to go out the window when you're craving a specific burger. 

Quite disappointed on the delivery of our order though; specifically the lack of customer service with our order. I mean, if we order TWO orders of French fries, you would think they would send SOME kind of sauce, no?! Am I asking for too much here?! 

I called Hopdoddy to ask why our order was lacking attention (ie. ketchup and napkins), and was told that \"No, we don't include any ketchup or dipping sauces unless specified.\" Umm... What about napkins though? Please, Hopdoddy, tell me where on God's green earth would I enter this information when ordering via food delivery app? I would think ketchup and napkins would be common sense/courtesy... where is the customer service? I get you guys are probably super busy, but c'mon -- ketchup? Really? Especially after spending so much on a small order... quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Only been here once and the burgers were awesome. Tried Labandita and primetime and both were exellent. Labandita was my favorite, just be aware thats its a bit different from your standard burger."}
{"text":"I am always looking for good burger places, and it makes me happy when I find a decent one just a few miles down the road.  My new work-from-home schedule has recently allowed me to try more of the spots in my neighborhood, and I have already visited this one twice.

Possibly the most awesome thing about Hopdoddy is they're all about quality, and that is reflected in something as simple as their fountain drinks.  Coke or Pepsi?  Nope.  They have Maine Root, the purveyors of one of the finest ginger beers around.  Inexplicably, they have pretty much every Maine Root soda besides the ginger brew, but they have other fine offerings besides.

I don't remember which burger I had my first visit, but it was fantastic, and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Next visit, I had the Greek, because I love lamb burgers, but this one tasted too much like a salad for my taste.  Still decent, but not a top-notch lamb burger.

The truffle fries, as well as the regular kennebec fries, are pretty good.

I'm not about to declare this place the best burger joint in the city, but it's definitely worth an occasional visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My burger was delicious!  I had the grass fed which is an additional charge but I was glad to have the option.
Great cold beer selection too.
I wasn't too crazy about the fries since I'm not too into teeny tiny french fries.  The seasoning was decent though.
The staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The booths wonderful. Televisions on showing the sports of the day on multiple screens.  Extremely courteous people.  If only the food could keep up.  $36 including tip gets you two burgers, one \"large\" order fries and a soda.  The kobe burger, call the PrimeTime should be renamed after one of Doctor Who's famous aliens, the Slitheen.  The first bite will launch the slimy little patty squirting out, leaving you with a caramelized onions, brie and arugula sammy.  Even if it were tiny and tasty, i would give them four stars, but this food wants me to leave two, bumped to three because of the sheer niceness of the staff.

What ever happened to a nice big juicy burger where there is enough to taste.  Hoppy will leave you hungry and confused, wanting to just get behind the grill and save these nice people!

Let's hope the owner takes a trip over to Texas where big can be good ;)"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place! The restaurant was very cute and very clean. The service was really good and all the employees were super kind and helpful! They definitely went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience. The fries were amazing and so was our burgers! The shakes are also to die for! Make sure to try this place!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed after wanting to try this joint for 5 months. First to find out that there's no servers. That you have to order and pay at cashier, even for spirits. Which is not much fun if you want to keep ordering rounds. Burgers were good but small. My first order of fries were cold so manager replaced with hot fresh fries. Not impressed with this place at all. I will not be visiting here again."}
{"text":"I finally made my way to Scottsdale to try this place. This mini chain started in Texas and now we have 2 locations here in the Valley. The \"Hop\" part of their name stands for beer (they serve artisan craft beers) and \"Doddy\" is a Scottish cow. Their beef comes from humanely raised cows that aren't given any hormones or antibiotics (according to their sign). They bake their own buns in house and cut their own potatoes for the fries. The restaurant itself is spacious and has a nice modern ambience to it. You basically order your food up front and they assign you a number and a table to sit at where someone waits on you. They have variety of special burger combinations to choose from topped with their own blend of \"sassy\" sauce. I ordered the Goodnight/Good Cause Burger (a dollar is donated to Lone Star Paralysis) - an Angus Beef patty topped with caramelized onions, jalape√±os and BBQ sauce. The burger is hot off the grill and really good. They also have great shakes here. Some of their combinations include Caramel & Sea Salt, Red Velvet and Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel. From a price standpoint, they compare with Fives Guys and Shake Shack. I definitely put them above Shake Shack for the better burger at $8. If you come during social hour (3:30pm - 6), they knock $2 off the burger and the fries are $5. My only negatives is that our food came out separately and I really didn't see the need for servers when you order everything up front. They are basically there to refill your drinks. But overall I give this place a thumbs up and will stop in again another time."}
{"text":"Interesting concept that I am not sure about how successful it will be.  You walk in and are immediately directed to go to the counter where you order your food.  Then you self serve your soft drinks like soda and water, then a hostess takes you to your table.  There a waiter introduces themselves and says they will be serving you the rest of the way, but a food runner brings your food.  All that waiter brings you are your cocktails, beer, or milkshake, and hamburger condiments, and then you pay that person.  The whole thing felt off to me, disjointed, I just don't get it.  They are missing opportunity to seriously make more money for instance.  As a suggestion, take me to my table, and give me a knowledgeable waiter who can tell me about the menu, bring me a cocktail or beer to get things going, let me soak in all the Tv's and cool vibe, and then I will order my burger.  Speaking of the food, the hamburger was 4 star excellent, perfectly cooked, excellent cuts of meat in the ground beef mix, the bun perfectly toasted, and lots of different burgers to choose from.  Now the bad, which were the horrible french fries, which I sent back due to being cool, not crunchy, and coated with some fake crap that was horrible.  Can't they just hand cut a real potato and fry it well.  My replacement fries were just as bad as the first one.  So why this was a roller coaster of confusion, and the only thing good was the burger and the beer, I give it 2.5 half stars."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each time did not disappoint. Had the turkey burger and it was so juicy. Truffle fries are a MUST!"}
{"text":"First time at Hopdaddy.  Definitely not my last. In fact, as I write this review five days after my visit, I lobbied with my family for a return but they were craving something else. 

We arrived at noon on a Sunday and it was 2/3 full. Good sign. We came here on a recommendation from a chef, so we had high expectations. We were not disappointed. 

You approach the counter and place your order and then you are assigned a table. They have a seasonal menu so I got the Llana Poblano Burger, with pepper jack and big pieces of roasted poblano on a freshly baked bun. My son got the Buffalo Bill with bison, bacon, Bleu Cheese and hot sauces, which was my second choice. We each ordered fries too. 

Our beers (huge) arrived in short order and Meagan took good care of us. Our lunch arrived 8 mins later. What excellent burgers!  Rich flavor, good balance of sauce-to-veggie-to-meat ratio. The fresh bun. Yum. The fries were cooked with spices that took them over the top. 

I can't wait for a return visit."}
{"text":"Mmm Hopdoddy. This is probably one of my favorite burger joints ever. I always get the Primetime which consists of Akaushi beef, caramelized onions, arugula, brie cheese, truffle and tomatoes. I've never had Akaushi beef before and never knew how delicious it was. Thanks to Hopdoddy, my standards for burgers are higher. The truffle fries are amazing, as is the garlic aioli it comes with. They also have a great selection of beers. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I've been here before & the chicken sandwich was great. As to why I came again, this time my chicken sandwich  was undercooked. It was gross. Then we asked for a box and she never returned, ten minutes. I ended up getting up and asking myself. Won't be going again."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome burger joint! Can't believe I have waited this long to try out Hopdoddy Burger Bar. This restaurant was surprisingly delicious and the staff was wonderful. Cannot wait to come back and try out some of their craft beers."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy's was great! Burgers were tasty, truffle fries were amazing, margarita knocked me on my ass, and the Oreo milkshake was the best I've ever had. If nothing else I'm going back for the milkshake. Friendly service. I just don't have anything bad to say about this place. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"It's game over people. THIS IS THE BEST BURGER PLACE ON THE PLANET!

I could go on and on about how wonderfully constructed the burgers are, and how diverse and interesting the menu is, or how nicely cooked the fries are. But this place stands out from a lot of the competition by offering OUTSTANDING SERVICE, AWESOME MILKSHAKES.

Service- a woman greeted us as soon as we arrived, and reserved us a table immediately. this is genius. it takes away the awkwardness of hunting for a table after ordering in a fast food style line up. this places was designed to move people as efficiently as possible, and its wonderful. it combines the efficiency of assigned seating like in a sit down restaurant, with the speed and accuracy of multiple cashiers like in a fast food joint. 

Milkshakes- i prefer shakes made with real ice cream instead of soft serve, but these shakes are awesome. both creative and wonderfully made. i can also see how soft serve is much easier and quicker to make. so from this perspective it makes sense with how busy it gets. 

I haven't gone into too many specifics about individual items, because they are ALL equally awesome. I could write volumes about these burgers that would dwarf the Harry Potter series. 

The only downsides is that it can get insanely busy, and that there isn't a location in my hometown of Toronto, Canada. 

It is essential that all burger lovers visit this place."}
{"text":"We really liked Hopdoddy's fresh new variety, but found the burgers themselves a little bland.

One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr

The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.

BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible. 

Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate. 

Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer."}
{"text":"Even though I asked for my burger medium rare and received it well done it still had some great flavor. I can only imagine the burger that might have been and the deliciousness I might have been privy to. Other than that the wait staff were attentive and quick to help us out. The only complaint I had was the whole process of having to wait in line and then being seated afterword. I understand why they do it but it can be a little grating when you have a larger party."}
{"text":"Had the basic bacon cheese burger and a ceasar salad on Friday night.  Everything tasted good but both me and my boyfriend had a stomach ache after the meal then bad stomach cramps.
Something was bad. This is the second time this place has hurt my stomach. Too bad I like the burgers here but if it makes me sick I will have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had Oreo milkshake and Terlingua burger. Burger was kind of spicy. I liked the concept. You order and then they give you a number to assign you a table. I wish they would expand to east coast because I loved it."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 2 instead of a one because I love the concept. Natural drinks, stevia for iced tea, home made buns and freshly ground meat. Sounds PERFECT... Until you bite into the burger and it's so heavily seasoned you can't begin to taste the meat. 

Our server only showed up once at the end. We asked if it's possible to get an unseasoned patty and the answer was a grimace with a \"no, they mix it in the morning and that's the only way it comes\". Grimaced indeed. If we wanted sausage we would've gone someplace that sells sausage. Neither of us finished our burger. Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Alright. 
When I first came here I thought that ordering fries separate from my burger was absolutely ridiculous. Let. Me. Tell.  You. IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S SO GOOD. I'm not much of a burger person, I ordered their Continental club and it is to die for!!! It was a perfect combination of turkey avocado.  Truffle fries, I highly suggest. You will average spend about $15 but again, worth it. Treat yo self. 

Also. Go during happy hour! Ive been back a few times for HH and Kirstin takes great care of us. 

Love coming here whem I crave a good burger or just a drink!  Definitely a fun environment for a group"}
{"text":"I love this place, great truffle fries, great mushroom burger, really nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Burger recipes are good, but execution was very poor. My Primetime burger was already cold when I got it. They put cheese, tomato and caramelized onion straight from the refrigerator - not a pleasant combination with a burger. 
Fries were loaded with salt, like 4 time more salt then anyone can bear.
Cashier, who takes the orders, was impatient and not helpful. 
So overall - a disappointing experience on Sunday afternoon (at 4pm when restaurant was nearly empty)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Primetime burger and even with everything it had going for it in the flavor department the actual texas akaushi beef was tasteless, it had absolutely no flavor what so ever. I was so disappointed. I mean with Brie Cheese, Arugula, Caramelized Onions,Truffle Aioli, and BBQ sauce instead of the Steak Sauce, one would think it would be packed full of flavor. Nope, nadda. The Sea salt Carmel Milkshake was a big let down to. Never the less, they were pretty busy and shockingly they have good reviews, so try it for yourself and decide."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food was great, so much fun. The burgers were made exactly how we asked. The shakes are worth every penny-try the Red Velvet or the Raspberry White Chocolate. The truffle fries are delicious as well. Fun atmosphere, too. Great for the whole family."}
{"text":"Pretty uneven all around. Love that I was able to order online, but modifiers and special instructions were ignored. Ordered the Goodnight/Good Cause burger, no jalape√±os, no bun and light onions. Got a bun, got jalape√±os, got a ridiculous amount of onions. Burger was a little over cooked as well. Wondered if I was being punked but it was still a decent burger. Parmesan truffle fries were a good texture but extremely salty. 

Pickup process was annoyingly disorganized as well. Walked up to the register, where I could see my order already bagged and waiting, was ignored for a couple of minutes before I was loudly informed that I needed to go to the bar.  Bartender was pretty disinterested but went and asked a third person to get my order. Third person walks my order to me and places it on the bar instead of handing it to me. Just kind of awkward all around. Could be much more efficient."}
{"text":"Awesome burger, not dry, moist and oh so good!!!! Garlic fries oh so yummy. Thoroughly recommend"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy has everything I like. Such as a wide variety of craft beers, fresh margaritas, fresh tasty burgers, unique crispy fries, and friendly staff. I had the prime time burger which was cooked to perfection and was one of the best burgers I have ever had. I also had the truffle fries which were on my top 10 fries list. If you are in the area I highly suggest checking this place out."}
{"text":"The hubs and I went here on Labor Day for dinner after he got off of work and it was still hopping around 8 o'clock!  We grabbed up an order of their green chile queso and fries and...I'm not kidding here...we could have just sat there and ate a couple orders of those and been fully satisfied.  They were freaking delicious and those fries...mmmmmm those fries...perfect!

I had their Buffalo Bill burger:  Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce
Hubs had the Llano Poblano:  Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Hatch Chiles, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Chipotle Mayo

He really loved his and I was sort of sad mine didn't hold more flavor.  Their buns and meat as well as ingredients are on par.  I was just hoping for something that exploded in my mouth like a burger at The Attic would have done.  I do want to try it again and try one of their spicier burgers as well as one of their margaritas when I don't have to drive home late on a school night."}
{"text":"What to say? I moved to Phoenix from Austin where I first encountered Hopdoddy. It was great in Austin, it is great in Phoenix. I have been 3x since moving to Phoenix in October. Go get a burger, parmesan truffle fries as an appetizer, enjoy, your welcome."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of delicious flavor?  Do you enjoy ahi tuna?  How about Wasabi chips, do you like those?  If yes you must try the Ahi burger, it's hands down the single best food item I've ever eaten.  Ever.

If you are one of those strange people who didn't answer yes they also have some good hamburgers.  If you're into that sort of thing.

Seriously though this place is amazing.  They have so many great options that even a vegetarian can enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for a burger joint! I got the tuna burger with fried egg. The burger was okay - not much flavor. The bun was a bit soggy. I ate it all because I was starving. Love the sodas!! I also tried a shake with Nutella. It was okay too."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times and every time we have liked it. Staff is great, good comes out quick, and their food is awesome. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to grab a burger! Make sure to get large order of fries! They're addictive"}
{"text":"Their fries are amazing! I ordered many different sauces to share with friends. My favorite was the truffle dip with the white cheesy dip in second. 

I also ordered a bison burger and the ahi burger-both amazing! 

The purple rain drink in memory of Prince was delicious. Not sure if they still carry it."}
{"text":"We came last night for dinner. I read the reviews about their concept and it didn't really bother us. We came in and was greeted by a waiter who explained the concept. We walked up to the counter to order and was told which table we were assigned to. From there, we had a waiter. The only thing the waiter did was bring out the food so I guess I don't understand why a waiter was necessary. They could simply have us pay at the counter and get a buzzer for when our food was ready. Oh well! There was this worker there that we really enjoyed. He wasn't our waiter but he walked around doing tasks. He had dreads and was wearing a hat. He walked around smiling, giving us thumbs up to check if we were okay, and was overall a happy guy! We like seeing workers enjoy their job. 

FOOD
Goodnight Burger - This burger donates $1 to Lone Star Paralysis so all the better. Delicious burger. Meat was tender and not at all dry. Flavors blended perfectly and every bite was really tasty.  When I got to the second half of my burger though, the bottom bun was so soggy I had to fork and knife it. 

Llano Poblano - The flavors were not too crazy and the overall taste of the burger was really nice with the white onions. The poblano peppers was definitely a nice touch too. This burger did not get soggy! Woohoo!

Truffle Parmesan Fries - I wish the fries were a little bit crunchier. They were a little soggy but still had a good taste.

Solid burger place."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Best veg burger ever.  Really nice servers, super clean , great interior, good music, and Mexican fountain coke! Every detail was well thought out. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"{*Soooooo*} this was my second time here. First time was on a random Wednesday the very first night I moved to town and today (Sunday). Both times the restaurant was full which is a great sign! 

Ok ok get to the important stuff, I get it! Jeeze! 

Tonight's order was the Buffalo Bill (which had blue cheese, sassy sauce, hot sauce and bacon). It was delicious! It was suppose to come out medium-rare and it came out well done but it was still tasty and delicious. It had the perfect amount of the Good kind of blue cheese too!!!! 

My hubs ordered the classic burger and added bacon and cheddar. His was cooked perfectly which made me a teensy bit jealous...

We shared fries....**YUUUUUMMMM** I love the soda selection with the real cane brand or whatever it's called and oh the Vanilla milkshake .......**droooooool** 

But really, this place is delicious. Zero complaints. Awesome staff, great atmosphere, yummy and quick to table food.

*cheers*"}
{"text":"By far my favorite burger place in Arizona! I even tried their Impossible burger... which knocked my socks off, a burger that tastes and looks like meat but is made out of 100% veggies. I am a meat lover so that is saying a lot! The beer is great, and try it in their goblet if you want the best ice cold beer that you have ever had. Fries and shakes are also amazing."}
{"text":"Great tasting & quality burger. Love the truffle fries. Usually quite the wait to get in but well worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to come here since it opened a few months ago.  We were forever passing by this place and it always looks happening so it must be pretty good, right?  Absolutely!

They did a great job renovating this place from a Lone Star Steakhouse (I think).  It is modern, open, and clean.  The place really is quite comfortable and a perfect place for some beers and burgers.  Most importantly it wasn't Scottsdale-doochey.

There is pretty much always a line and that's ok.  It moves pretty fast.  They ordering and seating system is pretty strange at first but there are tons of workers there that will give you the deal.  Basically, as you move through the line, you look over the menu and order a drink at the bar if you are interested.  Then, when you get to the register, you give your food order (after looking at a giant menu on the wall with no prices which pissed me off).  After you pay you find your table table and wait for your food.  After about 10 minutes your food arrives.  I know I explained the process poorly, but to sum it up think \"strange but efficient\".

Anyway, the burgers and fries I tried were excellent and likely nothing there is not a solid choice.  I want to try EVERY salad, burger, and side because they all look excellent.  Next time I'll Yelp more about the actual food instead of the actual place and process.

The staff were all very very friendly and efficient.

The only problem I have with this place is the beer selection.  It was seriously lacking.  There are like 10 things on tap (mostly local) but were things you could find at just about any other place in town.  I was hoping for some more interesting selections.

I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I tried the goodnight/good cause burger (has bbq) and it was delicious! Ordered some chili cheese fries and they did not disappoint. The only reason why I have it a 4 star is there's no coke or Pepsi products, which I think is a must with burgers, but to each his own. Other than that this place was great."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful classic burger with fresh and homemade ingredients. Really enjoyed an adult beverage from their Signature Sips list. You have to order at the counter and find your way to an assigned table, but then full service kicks in. Casual dining with a golden touch of class."}
{"text":"as far as gourmet burgers go, this place kills it. the servers also kill it. why only 4 stars? simple, I simply prefer a larger & juicier patty. I like my patties 10-12 & MR. Hopdoddys little 'add-ons- are what make their burgers . they are delicious don't get me wrong but if you want GOURMET, go for the Big was burger at the Roaring Fork although it will take twice as long to get but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Wanted to thank management for inviting us back after a horrible experience. We were treated extremely courteous on our visit unlike last time. Looks like some serious changes have been made with staff and training of employees. Excellent when management listens to customer problems."}
{"text":"Good food, wonderful service but they need to have two bartenders during peak times.  The one there tonight was not able to keep up with the entire restaurant of drinks AND the orders for food of the folks sitting at the bar.  

We will surely go again!"}
{"text":"Good burgers! Don't typically like chain places but this place is reliable! Been at least 5 times! Staff is friendly and nice beers! Quinoa side is overpriced for portion. Would give 5 stars, but nothing is completely out of this world here... I do recommend people to go here though!"}
{"text":"We used to hit this place in Austin Texas for years and it has a perpetual line around it during all business hours. The quality of ingredients is top notch. The fries and queso are a must try. All burgers have been fantastic. The drinks are different and fun. The shakes are fantastic."}
{"text":"Burger was perfectly cooked...great place to meet up with friends!"}
{"text":"I just love coming over here for a burger and a beer.  It is so tasty.  The only problem is that I always gain a pound or two, so cannot come too often.  

The ambiance is busy and noisy.  This is a very popular place and you will have to stand in line to order.  But I think it's worth it.  

I especially recommend the lamb burger - maybe it's called the Greek burger.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. You have got to try this joint!!! The mushroom burger with goat cheese and pesto is amazing. So are the fries!!! Gotta get the Oreo shake too. The decor is hip and they use all local products. If you want a good burger, eat here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Excellent service, delicious food, and a clean and comfortable environment. The burgers are juicy and flavorful and the shakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Just go. This place is awesome. My burger tonight was even better than I expected. Cooked perfectly, juicy, with tomato and lettuce and very tasty fries."}
{"text":"Good burger - fries awesome .. The ordering system is different so be prepared for a line and wait for a table .. Service is good and friendly staff .  Average burger price is 12.00!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a friend. It's a really cute place. I love the openness feel of it. The music that plays in the restaurant is awesome. I got the magic shroom burger and the Parmesan truffle fries. I'm not gonna lie the burger was good but I have had better. It is juicy and not dry so that was a plus. Now those truffle fries were outstanding! I love that they were thin and crispy. The seasoning on them was top notch and the truffle aioli dipping sauce that comes with them is also delicious. The people were friendly and the service was great. I would recommend this place to someone craving a burger. But for me the hunt for a great burger is still on."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh yes. Thank you for being right across the street from my work because I love you. I do hate your ordering system. But I'll get over it because your flavors are amazing. The french fries are divine as well as all of the milkshakes. I love the shroom burger and the black bean burger so much."}
{"text":"The best of the gourmet burger restaurants in town. Cool layout, the ordering is a little different and confusing at times but overall it is still very manageable. My favorite burger so far is the magic shroom but everything has been excellent thus far. The Parmesan truffle fries are amazing. Oh yeah and I forgot to mention that there milkshakes are the best that I have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazeballs seriously 
I'm a carnivore granted the burgers OMG so good. Fresh with just the right amount of saltiness and grease yes in a good way. For you PMS'ers out there it's a must have. Fries are great and according to my daughter the salted caramel milkshake was beyond good. 
So five stars is only fair..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, drinks, and atmosphere. I was with a large group, and we all had a great time and enjoyed our visit to hop doddy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Eating dinner at Hopdaddy Burger Bar was a spur of the moment decision after our party of 6 couldn't get a table at our first choice. But it was an excellent change in plans. 

Hopdoddy has a parking lot with outdoor seating and spacious dinning area. When we arrived, we easily got a table and then got in line to place our order at the register. All the burgers looked delicious, which encouraged me to order both the Ahi Tuna Burger and Primtime. 

The food arrived quickly and I ate it even faster. I tried the Ahi Tuna Burger first, which was amazing. The tuna was not sour or fishy and the condiments of nori chips and pickled ginger was an great addition. But what really made me like this burger was the honey wasabi, sweet and spicy/hot. The Primetime did not disappoint either with flavorful meat, sweet caramelized onions and creamy brie. I really enjoyed the soft, toasty buns both burger came on also. To top it off I ordered a side of truffle fries. 

Service was fantastic at the ordering counter, providing suggestions on what to order and recommendation for how to cook the protein. The counter across from where you place your order is an assortment of sauces, including ketchup, chipotole ketchup, mustard, honey mustard, and an aioli. I just wish that I had more room in my stomach for more burgers and a milkshake.

What I recommend:
-- Ahi Tuna Burger
-- Primetime"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and fantastic milkshakes! I highly recommend the Nutella and Pretzel milk shake. Only reason for the 4 stars and not five is the confusing ordering process."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in town! I don't usually eat many burgers, but when I'm in the mood this is always the place that comes to mind. The burgers here are delicious - not to mention that they are incredibly fresh. You can actually see a room where workers prepare and grind the fresh patties! 

They also have a great selection of yummy burger combinations on their menu. My personal favorite is the \"el Diablo\" burger with jalape√±os, habaneros, caramelized onion, and spicy mayo. But be warned! Don't get this burger unless you have a good handle on spice! They do a great job with their non-beef burgers like the veggie and ahi tuna burger, so don't feel like you have to get red meat! Plus, they have a good selection of beers and TO DIE FOR shakes and truffle fries - these are an absolute must to get!

The ambiance is great; I love how they always have a ton of string lights decorating the building. The service is also very friendly, attentive, and surprisingly fast for burgers. All around a very nice burger place!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburgers were good nothing out of this world but tasty. The green chili cheese is delicious. Also tried the ahi tuna burger it was good too. The poblano burger was good. The reason they get 3 stars instead of 4 is because of their order table system. It's awful. You walk in confused not sure where to go or what to do. You wait in line to order your food and wait to be assigned a table while in the line. THEN when sitting down waiters come around to see if there is anything else you want while sitting....I didn't know when to tip or if I was suppose to tip...just a confusing process that left me more frazzled then anything. Won't be back"}
{"text":"You know how negative reviews on Yelp always start with \"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would!?\"¬† Well, if I could give this place a 1 billion trillion stars (the estimated number of stars in the observable universe) I would. Yes, Hopdoddy gets ALL the stars in the universe.

We stumbled upon Hopdoddy while waiting for a trendy brunch spot a few doors down in the same strip mall last weekend. Our wait for the brunch place was 'somewhere been 35 and 90 minutes' while sitting on a bench we saw Hopdoddys and decided to take a look.¬†

I'm glad we did. The place is clean, modern, and has a really cool set up. The menu sounded delicious and the photos on Yelp proved that this place was pretty solid. They had no wait and were offering a burger and a beer for $10.

The ordering is kind of strange, you take a menu from the host, proceed to order at the counter, and a server brings you your food, any drinks from the bar, and condiments. Speaking of condiments, the options here for dipping sauces are ENDLESS- aioli, mayo, sriracha, honey mustard, chipotle ketchup, ranch, and sassy sauce. Sassy sauce is their house sauce made out of mayo and secret blend of sorcery and magic that makes it truly delicious. I recommend it. Beers are served in a large frosty chalice. Our server Glory was attentive and awesome. Made sure we never ran low on Sassy sauce.¬†

Now the REALLY good stuff: the burgers here are phenomenal. I had the daily special which was the Chicken Fried Steak burger - two beef patties breaded and fried with horseradish mayo and house made pickles. This burger was life-changing. I have never had anything like this. Easily one of the greatest burgers ever built. I am going to start a SuperPAC, an online petition, and engage Russian hackers to help get this burger put on the menu full time. It was just THAT good. Hopdoddy management, if you are reading this, please please please but the Chicken Fried Steakburger on the menu.¬† I'll get your restaurant name tattooed on my body somewhere if you do, I promise!¬†

The green chili con queso fries were insanely good, too. Word of caution, the portions for the fries here are HUGE. But that's not a bad thing. In fact, that's a very good thing.¬†

Let's Recap: greatest burger of all time? Check. A seemingly infinite number of dipping sauces? Check. Cool, funky, modern, and clean restaurant with no wait at brunch time? Check."}
{"text":"Hoody lol place with a great menu.  Fine dining burgers with creative items in a great chill atmosphere. Hop to it today. 

Save room for a tasty shake."}
{"text":"The food was great! Service, not so much

Service: 
Would have given 5 stars if the service was better. It is scattered and confusing. I felt pressured to order quickly without asking questions because of the line behind me. I get to my table and a lady holding a margarita gives me my drink. Later, a man brings our food. (We were told that we would have a server, but were never introduced to anyone.) It looks great, but they put sassy sauce all over my boyfriend's burger (which he hates.) All my guy would have needed was a new bun. He ate half, probably because he felt bad since I paid. Nobody comes back to check on us. I wait a while to see if I can flag someone down to order a shake once I was almost done eating. Nobody in sight,  so we walked up to the counter. Pretty lame concept.  If you want us to walk up to the counter for everything,  dont give us the impression that we will get service at a table. 

The food: 
Wow! This is a pretty good burger. They use quality ingredients and it shows. The parmesan fries are to die for. Ive had similar style fries elsewhere,  but they are always loaded with oil or butter. Gross. These were dry, crispy, and just perfect. I ate every last bite of my meal. My $6 margarita was strong. Even the soda fountain was impressive. No high fructose corn syrup, just cane sugar. I can appreciate a buisness that goes the extra mile to produce quality products all around. We ended with a shake, and it was the best! My man called the extra wide shake straw \"dangerous\" since we were sharing, and it was easy to drink quickly, lol!"}
{"text":"Service alone gets this one a 5 star. Marissa was awesome behind the bar and food was amazing. Best burger in Phoenix (Magic Shroom I think it was called) and amazing atmosphere. 6 stars!"}
{"text":"Quality of food is top notch. Burger cooked perfectly, love the different meat options from bison to chicken patties.  I tried the veggie patty as well, it was hearty and flavorful.  Only thing that is a little uncomfortable is the service style, you order at a cashier then they seat you.  It's like a mix of fast casual and actual servers. Wasn't a problem when it's not busy, but I came during lunch time once and it was obvious the huge delay was the bottleneck of the one cashier and limited seating."}
{"text":"The good: The food is absolutely amazing if it's prepared correctly. I travel a lot. The first Hopdoddy I tried was in Austin and it was phenomenal. When my bf lived in Dallas we frequented that location and it was also phenomenal. My favorite burger, so flavorful, and the chili con queso fries are amazing!

The bad: This location is no where near as amazing as the others. My favorite thing is the chili con queso fries and the last few times I've been the dip hasn't been mixed up. There's huge chunks of meat or unmelted cheese. How hard is it to stir it? They also fill up the cup less than halfway full which is nowhere near enough. Especially when you're paying $7+ for it. I always order a plain and dry classic burger. For some reason the burgers are not as flavorful here as they are at the other locations and they always overcook it. I specifically tell them medium each time (rather than the standard medium to medium well) and it always ends up medium well to well done. You pay and tip before being seated, some days service is decent some days no one says one word to you. When we first started coming we would tip 20%, but now that we realize service doesn't really happen here we tip less. Plus you order at the register and get your own drinks/sauce etc. and napkins are on the table. So service needs are minimal. I really wish it was either sit-down service or full counter. I feel guilty not-tipping, but unless I'm sitting at the bar (where I do tip 20%+) they don't do much.  

Conclusion: This branch needs to step it up to be the quality of the other locations. Austin and Dallas are 5 star, Scottsdale is 4 on a good day but generally more of a 3."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this place. I came in this evening for the first time with a friend of mine( who happens to own a restaurant in Scottsdale)way after the dinner rush. Ordering at the counter was easy, I chose the Bison Burger and my friend got the Ahi Tuna Burger and Truffle Fries. I was asked if medium rare was good, I said yes. As we were standing there, I noticed several already made burgers sitting under the warmers, yet the place wasn't busy enough to have that many going out to customers. 

No sooner had we gotten to our table and barely sat down and our Truffle  fries appeared. Now I am not a fry expert, but it takes longer than the 45 seconds it took to get to our table to make a fresh batch of fries.  My friend agreed. Ok,whatever, they are just fries.  However, not even 2 minuted later our burgers arrived. Well my friend thought it may be possible to sear the Ahi that fast but there is absolutely no way that you can cook a Bison burger to medium rare in 2 minutes.  Sure enough, it was lukewarm. It had been one of the ones sitting under the warmer. I brought it up to the manager,Mike, and he agreed it  shouldn't be lukewarm and said he would cook another.  Here comes the new one. Definitely hot and fresh. You can smell it and feel it. Now to cut into it. At first glance it looked ok until I took a bite and realized it was raw. Couldn't believe they served me raw bison. Went back to the manager again and showed him. He said he cooked it according to the time designated for medium rare. 1 min 45 seconds on each side then another 1 min 45 seconds to finish cooking. I don' t know who came up with that time table but it certainly is not enough time to cook a Bison burger. Manager apologized and was going to redo another . That one came out hot,fresh but medium well. I didn't have the heart to send it back again.

The only reason I gave it 1 star was because the beer came out in a very chilled, chalice-like glass which was nice. However we had to flag down our server to bring us the other beer we had ordered. He totally forgot, said some drama was going on.

Unfortunately I don't think my friend and I will be coming back. If this is how they are when it is slow, I would hate to see what it is like when it is busy."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all of the hype is about this restaurant, but my experience was not so pleasant. I hate to post negative reviews, and I only do when a restaurant can be spectacular and miss the mark by miles. 

I came in for lunch with my brother and sat at the bar. I was pretty specific about the order and it seemed the kitchen did not understand the assignment. I ordered the Greek burger, on wheat, hold the arugula and add romaine lettuce. Meal comes out on the egg bun, no lettuce. It was taken back to have romain added, and replace the bun, and instead of romain (which I know they have because they serve Caesar salads) it comes out with red limp lettuce. Upon taking a bite of the burger, I see that the inside is completely underdone. Obviously at this point, I'm over it. 

The restaurant had more staff than patrons, so I'm unsure how details are overlooked. The bartender was nice, however she did not write anything down and lacked the ability to remember and had to ask three times what the specifics were. 

My brother also had a burger, the traditional one with only ketchup and mustard. Apparently it was too much of a chore to put it on the burger and it came out plain. 

I wanted a burger so bad this day and normally I go to Habit Burger, and their burgers are perfect, always consistent, perfect service, hot meat and cheese, super cold veggies and no matter what I change, they always get it right. It is probably half the cost also. I chose to try something new and my level of disappointment could not be greater. 

The build out was nice, but the food was unable to match the decor. I am sure the concept is good. I heard who the owning partners are, and they always have great restaurants, so I am a bit shocked I was so disappointed. 

Typically in the establishments I dine in, when there is a disappointed customer, some form of management comes out to ask about the experience, get details so they can address the kitchen appropriately. Not one person came out to inquire. 

Word of advice, management should always come out and find out what happen so this can be rectified. Second, if you are going to call yourself a Burger Bar, and offer all of the options shown on the menu, the kitchen should be able to understand and prepare the order, as if they ordered it, and a temperature should always be requested."}
{"text":"Skyler hit the nail on the head. This concept is a little different but the food is amazing. I had the Buffalo Billy and my girlfriend got the Continental. We both agreed the size was perfect (maybe a little big), and the quality of the product exceeded our expectations. 

One thing - I don't think this is a place where you go for drinks. The process of ordering and eating doesn't seem to fit well with sitting and having beers and watching a game. And honestly I think that's okay because there are enough places to do that around here anyway. 

You can tip when you order or you can tip your server (this confused us at first so I asked a manager). The tips among cooks, servers, food runners etc are pooled. The bar is treated as it's own. 

Bottom line, great food, great service and I place I look forward coming back to again."}
{"text":"Updating this review to change it from 2 stars to 1 star.  We hadn't been in a while, but our son loves their burgers, so we finally relented and went back.    Previously, we had given them two stars because their food was great but their ordering system was abysmal.  The good news is: they've changed their ordering system.  The bad news is: they've made it worse.  Now instead of at least completing the transaction all in one fell swoop (ordering + paying), you have to order at one place and pay at another.  So, now the 20 minute ordering process becomes even longer as you have to wait for your bill, wait for the server to process it and bring it back, then wait to sign and total everything.

I can only assume this was done to try and increase the tips the wait staff was getting.  Well, I hope it's bringing in vastly larger tip amounts....because it's driving customers away.  We will not be back.  Ever."}
{"text":"I've been addicted to this chain ever since spending a summer in Austin, TX. The burgers are creative and delicious, the shakes are to die for and the drinks are all super tasty. I've had both the La Bandita and the Ahi Tuna burgers and would recommend them both. I don't eat red meat but have only heard great things about the Primetime. The parmesan truffle fries are so tasty they're worth the guilt. Bonus is that if there's a long line sometimes they'll walk around with samples for you to try. They also will take your drink order and deliver you beverages while you wait in line to order."}
{"text":"First time going was a great experience! All the staff is friendly & cheerful! Even though there know for there burgers, they have a good menu on salads! And a full bar!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today to check it out - and were NOT sorry!

Although the place is WAY trendy and VERY \"hip,\" it's still filled with friendly, helpful staff, delicious food, a full bar, and fantastic soda bar (no Coke or Pepsi, here; this is Maine Root Fair Trade certified, organically sweetened soda).

I got a bison burger, the Buffalo Bill: I was almost expecting it would be too hot, as many of the \"Buffalo\"-inspired burgers are, but it was nicely tangy with THICK bacon and a very savory blue/jack cheese mix. The egg buns are nice and sturdy, able to hold all the weight of the burger and toppings but not overpowering the flavor. I ordered the regular Kennebec fries, which was enough to share, and tried one of the sodas (\"Doppleganger,\" which appears to be their version of Dr Pepper -- as good as Dublin cane-sweetened). Tried the chipotle ketchup, which went really well with the fries! 

My wife got the tuna burger, sushi-rare, and said the honey wasabi opens the sinuses, but wow, was tasty!

While not as terrific as Delux (also not as expensive), still, this will definitely become a repeat location for us. It's close, it's delicious, and I really liked the staff and the ambiance. Definitely worth five stars!"}
{"text":"Went last night with my 3 year old to meet up with a friend. We got there early and even though you are suppose to order before you get a place to sit they were kind enough to seat my son and I as we waited. Bailey came by I believe she was the manager and offered to get us a drink while we wait and look over the menu. They have happy hour, score for mom!!!!!  Finally my friend came. We orders l the food came out. It was delish. My son loved his kids meal cheeseburger with bacon and fries, ate it all. Me of course ate all the fries and my burger. Now we are talking dessert! ADULT MILKSHAKES!!!!!! Can I make that any clearer. Yes they are not on the menu but yes they do exist!! Nutella chocolate pretzel shake with ALCOHOL! I can't wait to try. Then Bailey came by again to see if there was anything else we needed and she even made my son his little chocolate milkshake.  He was in love! Can't wait to come back and try more tasty foods and treats!"}
{"text":"This place was honestly really good. I really don't care for the 'gourmet burger' but this one is probably the best I've had. Get the Mexican coke as well! The meat is really the best thing, aside from the truffle fries. Be prepared to spend a minimum of $20 for a burger and fries though. All in all, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a Scottsdale staple. I've been going here since it opened, and their burgers always satisfy. 

The shroom burger is probably my favorite, but on my last visit I tried the veggie burger. It was had really great flavor and I loved the seeded bun it was served on. However, it was a little cold when it arrived at my table, so I feel like it would have been even better had it been warm. 

We also ordered the truffle fries, and those are my FAVORITE. I am a sucker for truffles and these fries are the best. The dipping sauce is perfect, and they give you a large amount so make sure you have someone to share with! 

Personally, I am not a fan of their milkshakes - they all taste the same to me. However, my friends love their chocolate stout one. Definitely give it a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty amazing but the service structure is annoying. You stand in line, order your burger, self serve your drink and condiments then the \"server\" brings your burger out and you wait and wait for your bill. Why not pay when you order your burger? The little service they provide is not tip worthy and delays your stay waiting for bill. How many times can they offer to fill an already full water glass?"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere! Would be a great place for happy hour after work. We just got takeout and all the employees were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Gluten free vegetarian options and their truffle fries and queso are seriously the most amazing. You HAVE TO TRY THE FRIES!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I have been twice and both times my burger was really good. I also love the fries either with the green chili cheese or the chili con carne...both are awesome. 

The first time I went with girlfriends and we sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive, although the person who closed our tabs at the end messed up and overcharged me...like by a lot. She reversed it but it took several days for things to correct themselves in my bank account. The second time my sister and I went and ordered at the counter. We stood in line about 10 minutes and we finally got to the front woman behind the counter said they were on a table hold. Since they assign you a table and all the tables were full you basically just had to stand there and wait for something to open up. Luckily something did and we were seated and eating in a short amount of time. 

My issues with the concept are: 

1. Why am I waiting in line to order and not paying? There were tons of servers who could have just waited on you in a normal fashion. That way you also know the wait to get a table before standing in a really long line only to be told that you have to wait even longer. 

2. Why do the servers ask you if you need anything? What can they bring you? You've ordered your food at the counter and you've filled your own drink...maybe drinks from the bar? I don't get it. 

Despite these issues I will go back for the burgers and fries...I just wish they'd rethink the wacky concept."}
{"text":"I went to Hop Doddy yesterday at lunch.  As usual I had a great experience. This place never disappoints.  I got the regular bacon cheeseburger and added a fried egg and guacamole.  I asked for medium rare and the burger was cooked to perfection.  I also love love their truffle fries and their Maine root coke.  
I first had burgers at this restaurant in Austin and the Scottsdale location is just as good!!  
My friend got a raspberry white chocolate milk shake and loved that as well.  

Great place and I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Good burgers, friendly staff, I usually sit at the bar. Sometimes too much salt and I prefer the bun without the butter."}
{"text":"I come all the way from Gilbert for the Ahi Tuna burger.
It's incredible. The wasabi is the perfect compliment on top of it. 
Good beer selection, fries were ok.
I'll be back again and again for that Ahi Tuna.........A+"}
{"text":"I think that this place is really overrated. I wish that I could give more stars. The burgers here are good and the service was good. I just think that it is crazy to charge $6 for a shake, a drink that is an average size and doesn't even have alcohol in it. The ordering system was weird. My husband really loved this place, but I guess the just missed the mark for me. I guess with all the hype about this place, I had higher expectations. I am willing to try it again."}
{"text":"So no prices on the menu. Haha, for good reason they do t want to scare you away. 

So we sit by the window upon being served the food looked really good and tasted perfect. 

Unfortunately we were swatting flies off our food and bodies while trying to eat. Extremely annoying. 

The waitress walked over and asked us if everything was good. We said except for the flies, and she proceeded to tell us that \" yeah it seems to be a problem this week\" and that they like to fly around where we're sitting. Did she offer to reseat us (no). Did she offer to make mention of this issue with the management (no)

I dont think she gave two shits about the flies. And because of that I won't be darkening your doorway ever again."}
{"text":"If you love experimenting with different burger styles, you must try HopDoddy! They use premium meat and there's no burger on their menu that disappoints. Even the black bean burger is good and it's vegetarian. 
They have an amazing happy hour where you can get the burger of the week for $5. I recently had their Poutine burger... and it tasted like heaven.
Also their customer service is exceptional. They're always there to assist. I will definitely be back again.

The only thing that I wish, is that they had is better soda. I'm just not a huge fan of their fountain drinks. The only decent one is the lemon lime soda, because it tastes like Sprite."}
{"text":"Pretty freakin' good burgers and the beer selection is awesome!

The setup, however, is not!   Order at the counter than go get a table and wait for the food to come out.  1... by 1.... by 1 more... and by the time the other person is done eating their food.... maybe you'll have yours in front of you.

Apparently this seems to be an issue with others and not sure it really makes good business sense."}
{"text":"Epic experience ! 3 of us tried the -
el diablo  - just as it sounds hot as heck burger! 
Continental Club - best darn turkey burger EVER !
The Goodnight - amazing angus cheese burger with jalape√±os & caramelized onions. 

We shared 1/4 of the burgers and they were all so good to pick a fav.  

The fires hands down awesome !"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, so this experience could have been a fluke, but none the less first impressions are a thing. 
The business set up is odd. You walk in and order at the register and they assign you to a numbered table. They have a full bar and we asked where we order drinks. The cashier was very nice and stated we could order with her, or order with our server. We opted for our server. 

We did NOT have a server. No one talked to us our entire experience unless we went out of our way to approach someone. 

Burger was amazing, but we had ordered some of their specialty fries and we were long done with the burger before we ever got our fries. It took closer to 45 minutes to receive them, and my boyfriend actually had to get up and ask the cashier about them. When the were served, they were delicious. They definitely understand food. 

I just really wish our first experience here was better because the food was amazing. But overall their business model just doesn't make sense to the consumer."}
{"text":"If I could only eat one food for the rest of my life it would be a hamburger. My home cooked burgers have set the bar high. When my family said we should try this joint out I was skeptical. First bite into my diablo burger I was blown away, not by the fire from the peppers. the burger was delicious. And the French fries really complimented them. The quest sauce was great. My only thing I was not impress with is the fountain drink. They have some weird stuff in that department. I didn't even want to try blueberry soda that doesn't even sound appetizing."}
{"text":"They have an amazing Veggie Burger! Pair it with the truffle fries and a Nutella shake and you are in Heaven. Sometimes they have specials of the month that include other types of Veggie burgers-defiantly worth trying the specials.  Very casual place with friendly young servers. It has a very nice vibe with a large bar with great selection of specialty drinks and beer on tap. 100% recommend if you are craving a good burger & fries meal."}
{"text":"Good sloppy mushroom burger. Fries were not bad. Sea-salt shake was good. But for the price of 2 burgers, 2 shakes, 1 small order of fries $34.76 ketchup should be at the table (Who doesn't want ketchup with fries??? That's the American way!) Or bigger cups for the ketchup. The staff was friendly.  I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try a new burger place that has gluten free options. The girl at the counter was really nice and the food was good. However, they were out of gluten free buns, the music was really loud and nobody ever came to check on us!  We were told we could order drinks and shakes from our table, but nobody bothered to stop by and check on us. We won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"The best turkey burger and chocolate shake I have ever had! Great food and decent prices."}
{"text":"My man-friend and I met up with some peeps last nights. It was pretty busy on a 7Thursday night. Happy hour is 4-7PM and 9-close Monday thru Friday. You get $2 off burgers and I think there were drink specials too. When we were there, the hostess will give you a table number. There was a pretty long line that wrapped along the bar... pretty sneaky and genius all at the same time!! The bartender takes your drink orders first and then the cashier takes your food order. 

I had the Lil Prick Martini... it was delicious. It was refreshing and light, not too sweet and not too  tangy. I forget what Mike got but it wasn't bad either. We shared the Buffalo Bill burger (add fried egg minus the onions) and an order of the Parmesan Truffle fries. I really liked the bison burger but they did forget to take off the onion, no biggie. The truffle fries are okay, I've had better.

The staff was friendly and attentive. They cleared out our plates and brought out more drinks quickly. Definitely a pretty nice place to meet with a big group of people."}
{"text":"Whether Prime Time or Classic Cheeseburger, I think this is seriously one of the top 5 burgers I've had.  Add a fried egg to any one of these and forget about it!  I brought my friend from Hawaii here and he almost looked a little sad eating it because he knows its something he can't get there.  My wife swears by the Ahi burger, but for me its all about the beef cooked medium rare!  Great meal, not much else to say."}
{"text":"They ran out of veggie burgers, the salad was just ok. Very disappointing. The manager apologized but I'm not sure if I will be returning."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy has long been a favorite of my family and friends, and every meal there is heaven! I usually go with the Primetime burger with truffle fries, but on my most recent visit I tried the Truffle Mac 'n Cheese Burger that Hopdoddy was offering as a special. This burger was outstanding, and should be permanently added to the menu! My boyfriend got the El Diablo burger, which he said was also amazing. The milkshakes are also a highlight of the menu: try the classic Oreo shake or the Salted Caramel! The staff is always very helpful and fast, and our waiter was attentive and funny. Hopdoddy is a perfect place for families, date nights, and dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Two visits in and I'm a fan.  Food is excellent quality.  Great selection and I appreciate there focus on a more heathy, fresh food.  I'm not a vegetarian but tried the \"La Bandita\" black bean burger.  Very good!  Service is very friendly and outgoing.  While a bit pricy - worth it over some of the other new burger places popping up. The local beer selection is great."}
{"text":"All around I love this place. The burgers are always very good and their special burgers are creative. The fries with truffle aioli are to kill for. The happy hour prices are very good, this is when my wife and I usually come. $5 for a drink and $5 for the burger special? Awesome. Also, we have been here maybe 5 or 6 times and the service has always been very good. The staff is friendly and very attentive to what you want. They take your full order at the register where you pay, but don't worry, if you want another drink they'll be close by. Great work, keep it up."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night. The line was long but super quick and we were able to squeeze in at the bar shortly after we arrived. Katy was our bartender/server and she is awesome!!! She's very knowledgeable about everything that goes into the food and she's super great with her customer service skills! Katy talked up into the cinnamon rolls and shake and, oh my goodness, they were the best drink I have had in my life. They are only limited edition which makes no sense to us so we are keeping our fingers crossed that they become a permanent menu item!!! Burgers and fries are to die for, try them all."}
{"text":"Owen the bartender definitely should be given a portion of the stock in this company. As a business owner I recognize it when employees own there positions and represent the companies they work for as if it is there own. I hope management recognize this gentleman with some sort of profit sharing or a salary increase to say the least.
It was the first time I've ever been here and I was treated like an king. Owen explained the menu like he owned the place as well as explained the Hopdoddy fresh ingredient and top notch beef selections and processes. 
And then the burger itself!!!! It was delicious!!! They only problem was I was stuffed and just wanted another burger! Definitely going back and have already started telling friends, family and now you the world."}
{"text":"I ordered the El Diablo Burger, added bacon and jalape√±os.  Could have been the best burger I ever had."}
{"text":"When you walk in, it's kind of weird. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing. You order your food and drinks, they give you a number that tells you what table to sit at and a server will bring you your food. The food is amazing. That's always more important than the service, but the day I went there wasn't any ice and the service was kinda bad. That being said, the food was amazing - so look past the weirdness of the environment and you'll survive."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Very unique and different than a regular burger place.  The meat is juicy and delicious, and all the burgers are really great.  I always get the Magic Shroom, and it never disappoints.  They also have a cool twist on your regular fountain drink, they have unique options such as, Prickly Pear Lemonade, Mexican Cola, Blueberry cola, etc.  They serve beers in a big iced goblet, and have a full bar as well.  The different types of french fries are also really delicious, as they are fresh, shoestring fries.  They also make all of their sauces in house, chipotle ketchup, honey mustard, and ranch, etc.  All of their food is local which is also nice.  I went to Hopdoddy in Austin, TX and it was good I was SO excited when they opened one here!"}
{"text":"The best burgers and fries I've had in a very long time. Also, I love their soft drinks, particularly the blueberry soda, although my only complaint is that one time, the lemonade ran out of syrup/concentrate and was extremely watered down, but other than that it is amazing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The best burgers (and a good variety) and amazing homemade shakes. They even have a full bar if you want a drink. It is not your typical restaurant; you walk in, the hostess reserves a table for you while you stand in line to order alcohol from the bar (if you want) and order your food toward the back, you sit down, and a waiter will fill up drinks and bring you your food."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Had Alexander as my server. Very pleased! Great guy amazing server. He deserves a raise or bonus or something! Incredible!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday around 2 and there was practically no wait to order. They do walk up ordering and then deliver the food to your table. The menu had a lot of interesting burger options and the guy who helped us was super patient and nice. 

I had the prime time burger (arugula, Brie, and caramelized onions). My bf had the terlingua burger (chili cheese and Fritos). My burger was really tasty. The Brie was not subtle at all and the arugula gave it a nice bitey taste, I removed most of the onions lol but kept some to get the idea, definitely complimented the cheese. It was super flavorful but the Brie was a lot for my taste, usually I love it because it's so mild but on this it was very in your face. The terlingua burger was great! The chili and Fritos added a lot of yummy, zesty flavor. 

We also had Parmesan truffle fries and fries with quest, both were sooooooo good! The garlic aioli with the fries it sooooo delicious, cannot recommend it enough. 

Everything was really quality. Although I didn't love love love the burger I chose, it was still an awesome meal. I would definitely recommend this spot for great burgers with a lot of fun and interesting toppings."}
{"text":"When I write reviews, I try to keep all things equal: the quality of the food, the creativeness of the menu, the service, atmosphere, etc. Hopdoddy makes a great burger and phenomenal shakes: 5/5. One thing I cannot help but fault them for, though, is the service and atmosphere. No, I do not want to stand in line with 30 other hungry patrons for 20 minutes just to order, then roam around with a number looking for a table. It's annoying and can become chaotic during really busy times. Yes, most of this can be avoided by simply sitting at the full-service bar, but good luck with that because you are competing with the rest of the restaurant over 15 bar seats.

Hopdoddy, your food is very well made. I just wish I could enjoy it and receive full service!"}
{"text":"I had no idea about hopdaddy & we just decided to stop in. I assumed I wouldn't be able to eat anything because I have a gluten intolerance but I was so happy to hear they have gluten free & are really good about keeping food safe! They also have amazing sodas."}
{"text":"Yummm. In two weeks, I have been to Hopdoddy's three times, and I am not a huge burger fan. I like the Salty Sow, but I love this place. 

A wide variety of very high quality hamburgers. Yes, the quality of the meat makes a huge difference. The Primetime is sublime, and the regular hamburger is pretty darn good although it could use a little more lettuce and pickles. My third option was the Greek which was a little too rich for me, but still the flavor and quality was there.  The salads look good, but it's going to be hard to tear myself away from the prime directive.

Awesome truffle fries and one of the best Margarita's outside of Austin, TX which is no surprise as these guys are from Texas. Yeehaw, baby.

The ordering process when it's busy is a little laborious, but the service is excellent. I mean really great. Solicitous without too much hovering.

The burgers are on the pricey side if you are a In N Out fan, but if you want a great hamburger with high grade ingredients, then give Hopdoddy's a try."}
{"text":"Great burgers, excellent beer selection, and super-friendly service.  What's not to like?

The burgers are highly customizable and really well made.  All of the ingredients are top quality, and generous.  The truffle fries were simply amazing.  Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries with creative sauces were absolutely awesome! Sure wish we had one of these places where we live. Really outstanding!"}
{"text":"High hopes, with so many great Reviews, that my #1 (The Grind) and #2 (Deluxe) favorite Phoenix Hamburgers were going to be challenged. 

They ware not!

That being the case the appearance of the restaurant it very nice and tidy and the service from the Staff was impeccable. 

I believe the biggest problem here is that the choice of accompaniments on the menu overcome whatever flavor the beef has. My choice was Llano Pablano, just as it is on the menu. My friends was El Diablo, again just as it was on the menu. Unfortunately, in both cases the beef taste of the burger itself never came through. Given the claimed quality of the beef and the price tag, seems like it should have been far more flavorful.

The Truffle Fires were equally disappointing, only from the standpoint there was virtually no truffle flavor, although they were well cooked with  excellent texture.

The Grind doesn't have to worry about being surpassed in quality, in spite of the crowds they are attracting here."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner. The food and service is 5 stars but the way you order and are seated is a bit weird which is why we gave it 4 stars. When you walk in you are assigned a table and then proceed to the counter to order your food and drinks. After you place your order you don't pay but proceed to your table. Once seated a server comes up and ask if they can bring you any sauces or get you the fountain drinks which you already have the cup for. That was the only peculiar thing. Their dipping sauces are awesome. My brother had the el diablo burger but if you cannot handle heat/spice this burger is not for you. His lips were burning. The other burgers that we consumed were the Buffalo bill, la bandita, and their special green eggs and ham. All were excellent choices. Tasty and unique from any other burgers we have had. Fresh ingredients too which was a plus. Their milkshakes were also out of this world. You are given a thick non collapsible straw that allows for thick delicious milkshakes. All and all a great restaurant with awesome food. We will return."}
{"text":"Very tasty hamburger the total bill is a little pricey when you're just drinking sodas so expect about $40 for two people with tip"}
{"text":"Our first time here, very good burgers and fries.  Their soft drink selection is a little bit eclectic, but they do have a good draft beer selection.  Service is a bit slow, so don't expect fast food.   We enjoyed it enough to return again."}
{"text":"They have all kinds of ketchup. Their milkshakes are filling and the burgers are great and juicy. Much better than homemade burgers.They are very organized and the employees are very nice. I would totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Here with my wife as usual. She said she was \"hangry\" and we had never been here so we decide to hop on down. 

Place looks very clean and new even though it has been here for 3.5 years. It was Sunday so lightly full. Ilene orders the ahi tune burger - AMAZING!
The goodnight burger my wife said was fantastic.  The Parmesan fries - AMAZING! and the Nutella pretzel shake - AMAZING!

This is our new goto place. In the past 2 weeks we have been literally 6 times. We absolutely love this place!

The service was great. 5/5. Overall 5/5!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger, always has a good ambiance and the fries are to die for. Their staff and crew are attentive and the good is always consistently good. Great place to catch a game with coworkers as well."}
{"text":"Well something has changed over this past year at Hopdoddy.  This review is really based bang for buck as I cannot beleive I spent $45 for two people.  Two burgers, one fry, one chocolate shake.  

Seriously, $45 bucks!!!???  I cannot come back and I will stick with In N Out where I can feed two with two double doubles, two fries and two milk shakes for $12.

The service has nosedived as well.  People were either haveing a really bad day or they just did not want to be there.  I really cannot say anything good about the service as it just did not exist on our visit.  

Sad to say, but this was my last visit.  Way to pricey for a burger and in most cases, extremly soggy bun that falls apart.  What happened over the last 11 months??"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and this was highly suggested by a family member. SOOO glad they did! When we got there they took our order everything is original and really fresh which is so respectable in the first place. When we made our order they came out about 10 minutes later  to say there was a delay in the order getting to the kitchen they gave us a full refund! Which was totally not what we expected at all, but it added to the respect we already had for this place. If I'm ever in pheonix again well forsure come back  they take care of you"}
{"text":"The La Bandida is a must have; the color is a little off but don't let that fool you! My boyfriend got the Chili Burger with Fritos and gave it a gold star as well. We were able to share the regular size fries between two people no problem. The beers were a bit pricey and came in a margarita type glass which definitely affected the taste of my watermelon ale. I'd recommend to a burger lover!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The burgers are really good and I like the fries as well. I got the Good Night Good Cause and thought it was delicious. The computers were down so getting our order in took longer than usual but the food still came out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"This place always has delicious food and great service.  I love their Kennebec fries.  Yummy!  I just wish that the fries could come out with the burgers.  Usually by the time the burger gets to the table, the fries are almost all gone.  I understand that they do not want the fries to get cold, but timing would be everything.  I definitely would recommend this place and would most certainly go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the ahi burger. It was incredible. Not your typical gourmet burger joint. Full bar is nice plus the speed it awesome. Def going there again."}
{"text":"I've been to hopdoddy several times as I live right around the corner. Overall it deserves high ratings- I would deduct a star from perfect because, like most dining establishments, there are some inconsistencies from visit to visit. 

The food is typically always between good and great, depending on the time of day and day of week. I've had some phenomenal burgers & fries- best when piping hot. I've also had maybe the last batch or bottom of the basket of fries that were a bit subpar compared to what they could be fresh. The salads are also tasty- although expensive for what they are, especially if you add a patty. 

I've read a few reviews of the ordering system and while I do think it can be a little bogus, I've only had trouble with it a handful of times. I personally prefer counter service so I can pay, eat, and leave without waiting for a check. However, I can see how the seating gets to be a little tedious, especially on busy days. My one gripe- affirming many reviews on here- is that sometimes there's a breakdown in communication and there are plenty of open tables but the seating hostess puts us in a \"holding pattern\" and we can't really order until having that golden ticket for a place to park our tushes. Talk about frustrating! 

It's not a great place for big groups either- I once brought my family and a few friends and we had to be split up into three booths- luckily by each other but we were unable to converse with one another at dinner. There were 12 of us. I would say keep it to 6 people or less for a comfortable group experience. 

I would say definitely check out hopdoddy for their food and ambiance- best to go on a less busy day or time. It's a little expensive but you do get what you pay for- high quality food and good service."}
{"text":"This place was pretty great.  

Lots of burger options.
Gluten Free Bun option.
The milkshakes looked great, although I didn't have one.

Did I mention you can order a craft beer from the full service bar while you are waiting in line to order?"}
{"text":"A++ Burger Joint!

Dropped by and the place was hoppin, pun intended. Several hosts at the door quickly recognized it was our first time by the somewhat confused look on our faces. They handed us menus, pointed out the large counter bar, and escorted us past it towards the back where you order your meal. You're given a table number and are challenged to find it. Don't worry, it's not too tough.

I ordered the Goodnight Burger and well, good night and get out, it was pretty darn amazing. I'll spell it out for you:

Angus Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, Hickory BBQ Sauce, Caramelized Onions Sliced Jalapenos & Sassy Sauce

The beef is unbelievably tasty with a great texture and cooked to a recommended medium/medium wellness. Don't be afraid of the jalapenos if you're heat-averse, they really add more taste than spice. I thought the fries were ok, but the burger is where it's at. 

Aside from the beef, you'll find a large selection of craft beer and real sugar sodas. The staff is super friendly and made the whole experience a good one. My only complaint is that there isn't a location closer to Tempe/Chandler, otherwise you'd have to pull me away."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a whim.  Opened on Monday (5 dais ago) And everything was amazing!  Since this review was started we have been back many times. LOVE the bartenders and the food."}
{"text":"I would give them a five if they brought the food to the table instead of ordering at the register. Loved the kale salad with Turkey burger. Best Turkey burger I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"if this place was closer we would go often, the service and food was really good."}
{"text":"The food is great!  I like how unique this place is. It's across the street from work, so very convenient."}
{"text":"From the burgers, rolls, sauce, fries, shakes, and drinks. This place is absolutely the best burger place in Scottsdale. Sorry Zin, you just dropped to # 2. I am driving from Cave Creek to Scottsdale often... I can't get enough of this place.. Everything I mentioned above, they make fresh everyday."}
{"text":"So I'm generally a fan in Scottsdale however there's a huge difference in food and service here!  Pics says the most - put it this way the burgers that they took off the bill and put it in a \"to go\" box stayed on the table! Sorry used to be a fan but this was horrific.  First time here to the new location and I have to say everything sucked from fries to burgers - thank god for In and out!!! Lol"}
{"text":"By far the best burger throughout PHOENIX!  This place is the best place for burgers and family!  The fries are amazing and the quality of ingredients is superb!  Fun environment and worth the wait in line!  We found our place when we are craving for a great burger!  They have hatch chile as well which makes it even better!!  + out of  !! Waitress --- Miss Amber was amazing - prompt and really provided great customer service!  Thanks Amber!  Oh, and she's related to Linda Carter somehow so that's cool!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a date and stumbled by this place. We went up and found out it was friends and family night but they would let us come in if we agreed to critique our food and service-absolutely! It was fun and different. The drink selections were great. The fries with green chili quest amazing.if you are looking for a different kind of burger place this is your place."}
{"text":"2/26
I ordered the Good night/good cause burger with bacon no jalape√±o with the sassy sauce on the side. Although the burger was juicy...it just didn't have me wanting to cone back for more. That sassy sauce tho....yummy!!!

Burger 2 1/2 Stars 

The truffle fries were delicious 4 Stars

I would come back for the truffle fries and I want to try a shake! The customer service was friendly and professional!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a gourmet burger in Phoenix/Scottsdale. No doubt about it, Hopdoddy is tough to beat.

At first, the setup is strange, but the more I thought about it it makes sense. You are required to stand in line to order your food, all the while standing by the bar and beer taps. At first awkward, however, the move is genius. For all of us beer fiends out there, this is your perfect chance to order a brew and sip on it in line while cashing out at the bar.

Secondly, while you're in line they bring around samples of their milkshakes. \"Do you want a free sample of our vanilla bean milkshake?\" Uhhh, yes I do, thank you very much. 

Third, the burgers are awesome. Perfectly sized and cooked just right, they come a-la-carte and you're going to have to order your fries separately, but they're large enough to share. My go-to when I'm at Hopdoddy is the Goodnight Burger (add bacon and make it a \"Great\"night), with the truffle fries. Do yourself a favor and pick up some of their homemade BBQ sauce for dipping, its delicious. Don't forget to follow everything up with their salted caramel milkshake. They give you an extra large straw so you're almost guaranteed to get a brain freeze - totally worth it.

The great thing about the madness of ordering through the line when you first arrive is that you get a \"server\" to take care of you once you've sat down and when you're done eating you've already paid (unless you got dessert or another beer - womp womp)! You can wipe the burger off your face and peace out whenever you like, no waiting on a check.

I highly, highly recommend Hopdoddy Burger Bar when you're looking for some bomb burgers to stuff in your face."}
{"text":"Overall, I like this place. The food was quite good and the place is nice and feels very \"open\" with all the window.  I don't like having to stand in line for 20 minutes. I understand why they went with this seating arrangement. If a place is crowded all the time this allows people to get through faster. However, I find it hard to justify standing for that long. There are very few places where I would stand in line Disneyland style for a meal. XOXO in Chicago is worth the wait (sometimes standing for an hour). This place may not be. I would only come back in the off hours. Ok, rant over.

The food: I had the diablo burger and added a fried egg and bacon. Very good. Far spicer than I would have guessed. My little dude had a plain cheese burger. Most of which he rubbed on his face then threw on the floor. He did seem to like it though. My lady had the ahi burger which she stated was \"really good\". We all enjoyed the truffle fries.

Great food, good beers, nice place, prepare to stand for a bit. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Fun place. Service with a smile by lots of fun people. They make you feel they love their job and are happy you are there"}
{"text":"Veggie burger is for sure one of the best I've had, delish avocados and smeared with a cilantro sauce that was out of this world. As non-meat eater I definitely appreciate a home made veggie burger vice defrosted garden burger.

Hubs said his classic burger was very good but not unlike others he has had at burger focused restaurants.

To drink I went with the Caramel Sea Salt milkshake after 4 separate employees recommended it to me. A milkshake is something I order maybe one or two times a year and this one was so freaking good I can see myself packing on a few lbs just from wanting it again and again and again. Were talking rocks of sea salt in my mouth. Oh yes. 

Fries were just right and spicy chipotle ketchup was a great accompaniment.

As for the line / corral nonsense, we arrived at 5PM for Saturday dinner so we really didn't wait, but by the time we left there were a good 30 people outside and at least 10 empty tables inside. I really had my doubts if Scottsdale peeps would line up at this place as I heard they do in TX .... Turns out they will but curious how long that will last. I can see your standard Scottsdale escalade driving frappucino drinking my-shit-don't-stink train wreck  group of guys trying to work the line here thinking they are all special and I don't think they will have much luck. 

The \"excuse\" for the line is that you are waiting for a table to clear but it's pretty obvious they line you up to create an appearance of demand and exclusivity like a night club. You have to follow the rules like a good little sheep I mean customer or you won't get your delicious burger. Personally I find it annoying if tables are open I would rather wait at a table and chill with a drink vice lining up like cattle (Pun intended) but I have to give it to them it's a smart tactic and they are hustling you to buy a drink from the moment you walk up so they clearly have a lucrative setup. And considering I was balls deep in a $6 milkshake before I made it to the cashier to order their setup works. The only benefit is you don't have to play the game where some fat ass is saving a table for his friends who are still parking their cars and you are standing there like a schmuck with a tray of cold food waiting for a table to open.

I will definitely be back but if I see more then 10 people in that damn corral and can't snag a bar seat I will just go to smash burger.  I will try to stick to early dinners or lunch to avoid waiting needlessly. Time is clearly money here and I would prefer not to offer to much of either up if I can avoid it.

Everything was great and so was the service- based on the accents they must have brought TX employees in for the opening and I will be curious to see if local employees can keep the service levels as high."}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic, especially the magic shroom burger if you like basil and pesto. All the condiments are homemade. It's a quirky service setup where you order like its fast food, but then are assigned a \"server\" which makes tipping awkward. Other than that, loved it!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far. Best burger ever? Most definitely. I gotta say this is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ. The pablano burger with queso fries are my favorite items. The burger is perfectly charred, while the fries are made from Kennebec potatoes (think in n out fries). The queso is very hearty and has a ton of meat in it. It's almost like a delicious chilli. If I could, I would visit this place once a week.

From what I remember all the ingredients are fresh, locally and responsibly sourced. Plus they have a bunch of local AZ beer on tap. It doesn't get any better than that! Do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"Burgers are good 4/5. Nice place to get dinner with some friends. The line to order can be extremely long. 

One problem: their chefs are inconsistent with meat rarity. I ordered medium-rare and got well done. My friend got medium well and got medium rare. We were too hungry to wait for another burger since we had already waited for 45 minutes in the line. This drops my rating to 3/5."}
{"text":"Good burgers, locally grown foods, great service and strong drinks. Isn't that all you really need to know when it comes to a burger bar? You want the facts.  Plain and simple.  

My recommendation is that you let yourself branch out here and go wild with a burger you think you wouldn't normally order. Ask for the sauce you think you wouldn't like to be put on the side so you can give it a go but not have to worry about it being all over your burger if you don't end up liking it. They have a lot of options here and you'll need to go back a few times to really get a feel for what will become your \"usual\" but that's the fun part about a burger bar, right!?

The fries are a perfect option for sharing between two or three people - I wouldn't try to share with more, you may end up ending relationships over an order of fries and who wants that.

So, if you love this place so much, why four stars instead of five you ask? Well. I have to agree with the other reviewer that said that the logistics of navigating this place can be a touch confusing on your first go. If it's really busy you'll wait outside, to get a chance to wait inside.  Then you'll get someone that'll walk up to you and hand you a number to give to the cashier when you finally get up there. You'll order and they'll tell you to find that randomly assigned table number somewhere in the restaurant...so now you get to wonder around a bit to find your table.  

Once all that is over though, you'll have good eats and now you'll know how things work next go round and be ready for the shenanigans."}
{"text":"Not your typical sit down and order restaurant.  At the Hopdoddy you are instructed to figure out what you would like to eat then you can go up and order.  Then they assign you a seat that you have to find after you order.  Over all the food was good.  We really enjoyed the fries.  The burgers were just OK for me, but my wife and daughter loved theirs."}
{"text":"The Thunderbird with a gluten free bun is the best GF item I've ever had at a burger place!"}
{"text":"Ok... This place was seriously incredible!!! My wife and I came here, and we're not disappointed!!! She ordered the Magic Shroom and I got the primetime.. they were both amazing burgers!! By the way definitely order the PV tea if you want an adult beverage!! We sat at the bar, which was great. This place has an amazing overall vibe and the employees were great. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Hopdoddy's on a hot Saturday afternoon.    

First time customers, we were thrown off a bit by the \"burger bouncer\" at the door who gave us the rules of the place.  Very strange method for getting a table assigned to us, then ordering at the counter.   Even weirder as there are waitstaff!\" whose purpose seems to be getting you refills on drinks and clearing the tables.  

Anyway, we ordered two different burgers and both the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Fries with Green Queso.   All the food was fantastic and we couldn't put anything down!    But what put the meal over the top was the Peach Cobbler Milkshake!   Beyond words, it was soooo good!!

My wife said she wished she was one of those girls that threw up her food in the bathroom so she could squeeze a little more in her stomach!!!

Highly recommended!  We will be back soon with our son!!!"}
{"text":"I have been reluctant to try Hopdoddy because it seems like every week there is a new burger spot to try. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.

Upon arriving, the restaurant is a bit confusing. When I walked in, there wasn't a hostess and I also didn't have a clear view of the walk-up counter. After standing confused for a minute or two, a staffer walked me up to the counter to order. What's even more strange - you don't pay at the counter. You're seated and a waitress will bring food, order extras, bring additional drinks, etc. So I'm not sure the purpose of the ordering style, but I'm willing to let it go.

The burger was solid. Very juicy with great seasoning and fresh ingredients. I was also impressed with the bar. I have low expectations when it comes to these bars - I usually expect a Red Robin type bar with pre-made cocktails and a small selection of beer. Hopdoddy hit a home run here.  

I ordered a watermelon mojito, which was made right in front of me. It was fresh and tasty. The perfect summer drink! They also have local craft beers - and not just the Four Peaks Kiltlifter.

My girlfriend doesn't drink, but she was very impressed with their sodas. Apparently they are handmade using cane sugar. Very cool!

Overall, a good spot for drinks and a burger. It stands out among a valley full of similar restaurants."}
{"text":"I may have found burger nirvana in this place. I had heard about it several times including at the Yelp Elite Salty Sow event and then randomly from a buddy who was there and knowing I am a foodie said it would be right up my alley. So I planned to go with one of my riding buddies and lo and behold as I was waiting for him 2 of my other friends showed up (we didn't know the other would be there). Obviously word is going around about this place.

I have to say I was worried that my expectations were too high going in having heard of the wonder that was the parmesan truffle fries or the high quality meat in the burgers. Turn out I didn't have any reason to be worried at all.

This place hits the nail on the head for burgers. I had the primetime which was cooked perfectly and had such a great combo of flavors. It is easily in my top 5 burgers of all time and that is good company. I was really impressed at just how well all the flavors went together. I am glad I picked that burger as it is clearly a well crafted work of art. 

I did have a hard time picking as all the other burgers sounded great too. My friends had the El Diablo and Goodnight burgers and i can honestly say I don't think I have seen burgers get devoured that fast before. Needless to say we were all impressed.

The fries didn't disappoint and the truffle sauce with them is amazing. We also indulged in some shakes. i have the Chocolate Stout Shake and it was great, the stout flavor was subtle but fantastic.

The food is a sure fire winner here....the ordering process not so much. The process for ordering isn't bad but it's awkward. What normally happens is you go through a line to order and get assigned at table where food is then brought to you. However since one buddy and I were ordering after the others we were told we could order right from the server at the table. The same was true of ordering additional food like the shakes. It was nice and our server was great it just was a bit odd. Not sure if this changes during big rushes though as we were there when it was late and emptying out.

In summary this place has awesome food go try it."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite burger place, paired with an excellent bar. The ambience is friendly and upbeat. Very original twist on burgers with all kinds of funky stuff to go along. Their cocktails are AMAZING, especially the Moscow mule."}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected. I've had much better. Fries were soggy, burger was a bit bland. Bread was nicely toasted. Service was ok

I had to update this post. Not long after I posted this review I received an email directly from the GM. His email was incredibly professional and seemed very sincere that he cared about my experience. I will certainly go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time since I live closeby.

Gotta say, the whole idea of waiting in a line outside the door to order was annoying. I'd prefer to be waited on at a table. But oh well.

The environment was cool.  Very open feeling. Brand new place so everything was very clean.

The service was good and the food came out quickly.

Ordered a taco burger and was please. Not the best burger I have ever had, but very good. Their fries are delicious as well! Especially with parmesan ones.

I also ordered a milkshake and it was SO good! That was my favorite part of the meal.

Overall a great experience with good friends. I would go back and try more of their unique burgers."}
{"text":"I ordered a Llano Poblano burger with their truffle fries. Burger was fantastic and so were the fries. If you're going here you have to get the truffle fries. They have different kinds of dips for your burger/fries. Place is clean and trendy and they have a good happy hour. 

I am giving this place 4 stars rather than 5 for one reason. I hate to be a \"stick in the mud\" but there was one thing that bothered me. When I went the place was relatively dead. Perhaps 6 other people in the restaurant before the rush hit about an hour later. Anyways, the wait staff was mingling around chatting. No problems with that, friendly chat with your coworkers is great. There was one conversation between two workers that was incredibly loud and about some bodily functions that were pretty gross especially since I am waiting for my food. Hearing people talk about their snot isn't an appetizing conversation."}
{"text":"Super good.  One of the best burgers Amy and I have had. Try the Queso fries. The service is outstanding too. Welcome to Phoenix Austin company"}
{"text":"Very happy with the food. I have been here 3 times. Twice in Scottsdale and once in Dallas. It is a very cool concept and the execution on the food is very good. I enjoyed the Ahi Burger and salted caramel shake. The beer selection is great. Just be prepared for a line if you go during peak hours."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy has a unique atmosphere and probably the best burger I've had in Phoenix.

The El Diablo burger is fantastic... juicy patty, spicy jalapenos with a delicious guacamole. I highly recommend the Truffle Fries, the dip they come with is well worth the calories.

The line can get pretty long around dinnertime, but the staff will take your drink order while you wait for a table, which tends to make the wait much more tolerable."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I got the black bean burger with fries and a drink for $18.... Wayyyy overpriced. Could have got some similar at another restaurant for $10 or $12"}
{"text":"Great milkshakes, had the one with nutella which was really good but maybe a bit high on calories but who cares if its good :)
Burgers were also good maybe not the best ever but really good. Had the bison and was completely satisfied. Would have been nice if this place was located more central but you can't always get all that you want"}
{"text":"5 stars??? No 6 stars if I could!! Best hamburger ever,awesome place and really cold beers. AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you are bringing friends or a date and are not a super serious burger lover.   The lay out of the restaurant is open and inviting. The staff is friendly and attentive. The burger I ordered was the Llano Burger medium rare and it was a good burger and the fries were good too.  However, the $15+ dollars that this meal cost leads me to not recommend it to serious burger lovers or even casual diners as you can find a better burger nearby (Shakeshack or Rally's depending on taste) and are really paying for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Good food excellent tuna burger always fresh and flavorful has wasabi as a nice  touch"}
{"text":"Great burger joint! From California and have eaten a lot of awesome burgers... The burger I had today was fresh, tasty and delicious!
The pic my last bite! Wish I had more...
I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Friendliest  staff Ever. No one compares to their burgers and fries. No One. Although with their promotion of 10$ pairings of burgers and beers they are neglecting the quality of their tuna burger. I loved it before and I will go again but not till after the promotion. A free beer isn't worth a bad tuna sandwich. And a bit of a tip , if you'd like a water, make SURE they know you Want a water. I believe they may be trying to conserve with as many time as they've forgotten to bring it."}
{"text":"Decent craft burgers with the option to add other patty meats and flavors. Salad options also available. Service is order at the counter then sit. But there is also tableside service too in case you forgot something at the counter. 

Booths and tables available. Pretty good for families."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love a good burger and don't mind paying a little extra to have a quality meal but on my first impression of this place I say Pass.
We ordered a Greek burger and the Buffalo burger, regular fries and parm fries plus two drinks.....punch line it was $36. 
The first two burgers that came out we're undercooked (we ordered our own temperature ) and had asked for no sauce on one but upon investigation I found assume under the one piece of lettuce which is not cool since I'm allergic. To the mustard in it.  Our server was very sweet and apologized and said she would make us two new ones. We  snacked on the fries while we waited 10 minutes for the new burgers. Side note, no visit from any manager yet to address this issue. While we waited a tray of dishes was dropped right by our table , coincidence ??
Second round of food came, no feta on the Greek and my side of fries from my plate had mysteriously disappeared from my plate.  Waiters came by to check on us and had to send her for fries and yes you guessed it still no manager got involved .

I love trying new places but this place is a one and done!!!!!
I could have gone to Denny's, left full and had an extra $20 in my wallet"}
{"text":"A solid burger offering to be sure but at this stage in the game it is given 'also ran' status as it fails to distinguish itself from the ever growing $7+ gourmet burger field.  I share the sentiment about the order/set up system.  Also feels more FoxRC and less Austin which is kind of disappointing considering that Scottsdale would be well served by giving up some of its rhino-plasticized pretense in favor of a willingness to 'keep it weird' or authentic."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend & friends, we all are now obsessed! This place is great! The stand in line to order and receive a table number to sit at after ordering seems weird, but it's so Efficient! We went at 7pm (it was packed), we waited in line for about 20mins, however it went FAST. The staff is constantly bringing over samples for you to try, they take your drink order while in line so you can sip while you wait- lots of local drafts available and they even make their own triple sec and lemoncello! 

The food is made fresh- and it's amazing! Every person in our group ordered a different burger and different style fries- ALL were GREAT! I ordered the shroom burger that has goat cheese and pesto on it and WOW! Best burger I've had ever. Parmesan truffle fries were mind blowing good!
Every person working was positive, nice and really wants you to enjoy your dinning experience there!
Also, a huge plus in my book is that they recycle and compost! 
We will be back for sure. Well worth the drive from the West Side of the Valley!"}
{"text":"Meh. 30 dollars later and I had a mediocre burger, fries and a super sugary adult bev. Sneak into In 'n Out with a flask instead and you and your wallet will leave A LOT happier."}
{"text":"These guys are so disorganized. The place is like a train station loud and you can't hear yourself talking. The greater tells you while you wait for a table you can go and order. You go out of line to order and they won't take your order without a table number. Manager isn't any better at resolving problems, could care less. We just walked out and would never go back. Plenty of good places that will take your money."}
{"text":"Best happy hour EVER! I'm currently on my third visit to Hopdoddy and continue to love it. 

I know some people seem to dislike the odd ordering structure they have, but I think the food is well worth the irregular set-up. Just a bit of an overview: You walk in, grab a menu, go to the counter where you order and get assigned a table, then you go to your table. From there everything is structured like a normal restaurant, you can order more food, your food is delivered to your table, and your server brings you your check. Honestly, it seems to be an unnecessarily complicated system, but once you go through the process once it isn't that annoying. 

Back to why I love this place-THE HAPPY HOUR! From 3pm-6:30pm Monday-Friday all of their cocktails(plus other drinks), fries, and seasonal hamburgers are $5! I love it because it makes me be more adventurous and try out some of the seasonal burgers that I otherwise might have missed out on. You really can't make a bad choice when it comes to the food here."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT burger joint! The truffle fries top it off! I also love the big beer mugs, makes me feel like a viking! Lol! The food is fantastic! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went for the 1st time last week, but it won't be our last!!  This place is great!  Great food, great staff & great atmosphere!
We started with the parmesan truffle fries, then each got a burger ~ classic for me & primetime for my husband.....yum!"}
{"text":"GREAT burgers - loved every last bite of the Goodnighter. Lots of options, all sound great. 

A little overwhelming on your first visit, but the staff guides you to the right spots to order and sit. Fried were good, but not great. Will definitely be back through - fantastic burger and would love to try more of the menu and shakes."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!!! I wish i could give them more starts if i could. The truffle fries was soooo good and the beer came in a frozen glass. The servers were very nice and friendly. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"We just ate at your SCOTTSDALE AZ location and once again your burgers and food overall was excellent and has not disappointed us to date!

In addition, your Soda fountain has the absolutely best sodas around with that extra filtered water and cane sugar like the pop from Mexico still has and what a treat since I don't even drink soda much anymore due to he HFCS sweetener in the standard sodas, says Bravo there!"}
{"text":"The food is always great here. Tonight the customer service was amazing. All of the young women working were so friendly and helpful-from the woman who took our order, the food runner and server. Hopefully their boss reads this and does something nice for them. This location has been so much better in my experience than the one in Scottsdale. The good is really good. Tonight I had the diablo burger. It is spicy but good. The server suggested sassy sauce. It was great. We had truffle fries as well. This is a great place for quick but excellent service that also has great food and cocktails/beer."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst waiting situation. Don't go on a busy night. You have to wait in line outside 30-60 minutes. No waiting area no seating. We were not to stand at the bar because the hostest did not want to \" crowd the area\".

Didn't get a chance to eat and probably won't go back to try. Very poor planning for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to Hopdoddy on Sunday, Oct. 8th.  We were here once before and wanted to have the truffle fries.  I hade the Primetime and my wife had the Classic.  Of course we had two orders of fries.  The bad news was our food was not hot when it was served.  I was starving so I ate mine.  We complained to Ulku who promptly offered new burgers and fries, but I had wolfed mine down and wasn't hungry anymore.  Ulku tried everything to make it better, offering free shakes, etc.  Ulku did refer our situation to the manager, Demetrie.  Demetrie came over to apologize and told us our meal was comped.  We didn't ask for this or anything free, but the staff knew how to take care of a bad situation.  We will be back because of the service."}
{"text":"Been a fan since I went to their location off Congress in Austin.  This location seemed a bit slower but the same great flavor of burger and parm fries. Bartender was efficient but hardly made small talk. No worries since the majority of my meal was spent grubbing down hardcore. I treated myself to a specialty shake of his choice, I think it was tres leches. Took it with me as I left and I still rave about Hopdoddy. I'll bring the lady and infant next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm a big burger fan and I really wanted to like Hopdoddys. The drinks were good, however the food left something to be desired. My Buffalo Bill burger came to the table barely warm. Cheese wasn't even beginning to melt. The \"caramelized onions\" advertised on the menu, were completely raw onion slices. No hint of color whatsoever.The ordering process seems a little confusing and, having only one person at the register, makes for a bit of a wait. For the price, I was left a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there when I was in arizana I got the buffalo hamburger It was amazing. The service was great. There soda could be change to coke, sprite. It was very welcoming."}
{"text":"This place was a lot to take in and certainly not what I was expecting.  There was plenty of good to go along with plenty of bad.

First of all, the place was packed on a weeknight, but their inane ordering system can't support a crowd.  You wait in line until a table is ready... but then you order at a counter anyway.  It seems like an elaborate ruse to keep you standing next to their beer taps, which was a fine local selection.  Food is reasonable ($8 burgers, $5 shakes) because they make it back on the $6 draughts.  But the drinking aspect of the experience keeps people at their tables longer, which makes the line move slower.  IT'S MADDENING!

We were starving by the time we got our food.  Fries came first and they were good, but not outstanding.  (We probably should have ordered the truffle fries, which looked good and have been getting rave reviews.)  The burgers were flavorful on a brioche bun with a mayonaise  based sauce, but they meat was too salty and too greasy for my taste.  The raspberry shake was thin and unspectacular, but the nutella pretzel shake was one of the best shakes I've had in my life.  Sure, the pretzels were so big that many couldn't fit through the straw, but that left a spoonable pretzel treat at the bottom of the cup.

Also, they had several housemade ketchups and sauces which were actually pretty good.  Everyone from Pittsburgh considers himself a ketchup connoisseur and these actually weren't offensive to me.

The decor was nice.  Happy hour prices looked really inviting, although I can only imagine the crowd.  Hopdoddy did enough to bring me back, but they're still suspect in my book."}
{"text":"Went here today for our weekly cheat meal and it was a success!! Best milkshake I think I have ever had I got the Nutella one. The Parmesan fries with aioli were also amazing! Got the good burger and the shroom one also both delicious! Good service and the food came fast too."}
{"text":"Burgers and drinks (I like the Lil' Prick although I hate the name) were delicious. We ordered 6 burgers on a busy night and they came quickly and without problems. 

 Ordering process is a nightmare but once you are sitting everything is taken care of. Servers were fun and quick. 

We will go back, on a slower night I hope."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger: GO HERE! The burgers are perfect. And if you're vegetarian or vegan they have delicious options! I tried the impossible burger (meatless) and I actually prefer it to a red meat burger. The truffle fries are to die for. The atmosphere is great and the service is quick."}
{"text":"PROS:
Tasty food & drink, slightly swanky ambiance, decent prices for the quality/ambiance and pleasant staff.   

CONS:
Awkward ordering/seating/service system. 

Here's some more detail, if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know.

FOOD/DRINKS:
My husband and I split the caramel and sea salt milkshake, which was delicious  - creamy with really great caramel flavor accentuated by the salt.  It's not huge - a little smaller than a Solo cup - which was actually great for us but smaller than the average milkshake.

A nice big serving of tuna on the ahi sandwich - served raw in the middle and seared on each side.  The toppings really make it pop - lots of flavor from the terryaki sauce, honey wasabi and crunchy nori.  

The la bandita burger has a great patty, and between the cheese, avocado and chipotle ketchup (we asked them to leave out the mayo and added their chipotle ketchup ourselves, instead), it really tastes great.  The whole wheat bun adds a sligth sweetness.

Note: sides are sold separately.  This suits me fine, but just FYI.

ATMOSPHERE:
Very nice ambiance - a bit industrial with lots of blond wood and low lighting and no wall in front of the kitchen.  The booths are particularly awesome - comfy benches, high but with foot rests.  The beautiful bar has them, too.

ORDERING SYSTEM:
You have to stand in a line (that isn't too efficient) to order your drinks(at the bar) and food(at the counter), while a hostess assigns you a table (but doesn't take you to it, just sticks your number on it).  She hands you a slip with your number, which you have to hand over when ordering.  

Just in case the nice atmosphere has fooled you into thinking you're in a regular nice restaurant, just before the food counter, a sign reads, \"Woah, nelly!  EASY ON THE MODIFICATIONS, PLEASE\"  The did leave the mayo off both sandwiches for us without complaints, but I'm reluctant to try substituting the veggie patty for meat in their mny menu items the future.

Once you've ordered, you're funneled through a fountain drink/condiment station and let out in one corner of the restaurant.  You go find your table and your food and drinks are gradually delivered to you by pleasant people.  

Another weird thing is that, at this point, a server comes over and says he'll be taking care of you.  My first thought is that I just stood in a long line and endured a rude sign to do my own ordering - am I now expected to tip this perfectly nice fellow for refilling my water?

CONCLUSION:
We'll definitely be back, but it'll be in spite of the ordering system.  Also, we'd probably think twice about coming here with other couples because of the initial awkwardness."}
{"text":"Burgers are my #1 favorite meal, I ordered my burger medium and it came out med well to well; after trying it, it didn't matter because it was delish! The FF are pretty badass too, it's definitely my new go to burger spot..."}
{"text":"Milkshakes are AMAZING! Highly recommend you try one.  The truffle fries are also very delicious. I personally am not a fan of the burgers but my family loves them. The service is great, always very upbeat, pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Went back to Hopdoddy today after about a 6 month break from it. We waited in line, and were assigned to table 25 by the hostess. When we arrived at the register our order was taken and assigned to table 25.  The woman behind the register asked if we wanted anything from the bar, and I said I thought we ordered bar drinks from our server. She informed me that they have yet again changed the flow of the restaurant and now everyone was to order everything and pay for everything at the counter. I joked with her that every single time we come to the restaurant it's different and she laughed and agreed with me. So I ordered my beer with her, paid, and we headed to table 25.

Surprise surprise, some other woman and her 2 daughters are at table 25. So I asked her if that was her assigned table, and she told me she just sat down there and a waitress came and took her order. I explained to her that we waited in line like we were supposed to and were assigned that table, and she basically told me too bad. She also told me someone just tried to bring her a beer that wasn't hers. Yup, mine. So I found the hostess and told her what happened and they still let this woman steal my table.  They assigned us to a different, much less desirable table right in front of the door, and while they did finally get our food to the correct place no one ever brought me that beer. I went up to the bar and explained and the bartender happily poured me a new one.

What a mess. This is the most disorganized restaurant I have ever been to. They constantly change the flow of the restaurant which is probably why the employees never seem to have any idea what is going on. I used to think the food was so good that I could put up with the aggravation, but tonight's visit changed my mind. My Buffalo Bill was undercooked and my portion of fries was paltry. I won't be back, which is sad because I used to be a huge fan. I've just been jerked around enough by this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger but woefully overpriced for a glorified fast food joint. Glad I tried so I'm no longer curious but I likely will not return. Give me 5 Guys or In n Out for less despite no alcohol and I'm very happy. Hard to imagine this place could last much longer."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious. We got it to go, which took the same amount of time as dredging through the circus-freak of a line in the restaurant. Literally, the line and layout of the restaurant is ridiculous. It feels like 2 restaurants in one, with just a million things going on at once, with food being passed around on trays to sample, being delivered to tables, a line to stand in that wraps around the bar and the hostess stand,  loud patrons, even louder staff. The bar felt like a sanctuary. The food was delicious. The bar even had these tiny have sized cocktaiol drinks just for sipping, perfect for those of us getting behind the wheel. I would love to return when it's not too busy, I don't think I'll return if it is ever that packed again."}
{"text":"We came across this place yesterday walking around this restaurant district. This place caught our eye and we weren't disappointed. The patties are fresh, and delicious, definitely can taste the difference. The combinations are different. I got the prime burger which I did forget what kind of beef it was, but it had carmelized onions, a Chipotle mayo, and basil. I didn't care for the basil, but the flavor combination was good. My fianc√©e got the buffalo burger which she really liked. We split a large fry, which they are to die for, fresh hand cut. To drink I got the black cherry hard lemonade, and my fianc√©e got the Lil prick, which was the prickly pear martini. I liked the martini over the lemonade. Then for dessert we split a oreo milkshake. It was amazing. They put cinnamon in the vanilla ice cream, which the combination taste amazing. The only problem I had us that is we got our food before our drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome! Concept and good food!! Really liked it..... Love the fresh ingredients and amount of food.... Soda is a little pricey.. But natural...So I guess that's ok...Lol otherwise excellent will be back.... BTW.. Much better than deluxe..Or habitat Burger....."}
{"text":"Burgers be ballin' at this trendy burger joint. Served on the metal trays reminiscent of ones that can be found inside toaster ovens in lieu of plates, these burgers aren't messing around. There are no garnishes or fancy flowers to distract from the main attraction.  The burger beckons at you to eat it. 

Being Valentine's Day, my hubs and I didn't know what to expect. We were relieved to find plenty of parking, but were disenchanted to find such a long line inside. Ah ha! One of those \"walk up to the counter and order\" places. In order to allow for adequate timing of seating, and preventing those annoying seat savers from monopolizing the grounds, your table is assigned conveniently while you're in line. While looking at the menu you're handed while getting in line, you can also order drinks from the bar since it's on the right side. I didn't hesitate to try my Skinny Dip cocktail. Having a mini coronita upsidedown in a large margarita glass filled with frozen alcohol just seemed appropriate when the temps were starting to rise outside. 

The Prime time burger was delicious. I couldn't really tell the difference though between the Akaushi beef versus other types of beef. You can't really go wrong with Truffle Aioli, steak sauce, and Brie cheese. The caramelized onions ever so sweetly caressed the beef and Brie. It seemed like a match made in Heaven. 

The Diablo seriously packed some punch with some bites that were super spicy. My hubby said that it was one of the spiciest burgers that he's ever had and he the type to enter spicy food eating competitions and win them. He did go on to say that although it was super spicy, he loved it because he felt that it was \"just right.\" He always complains that other places claim that a menu item is spicy and doesn't pull through. From his words, you can count on this one to taunt your taste for burn and flavor simultaneously. 

We shared the truffle fries, but although very flavorful, they weren't quite \"truffly\" as one would expect. I guess that was good though, because the side didn't over power the burgers we had. I also plan to order the red velvet shake next time because that just sounds awesome doesn't it? My vote is that they add alcoholic shakes to their menu too because that would be phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Their fries are all gluten free (and yummy!), and I had a lettuce wrap mushroom burger which was to die for! My only complaint is that they don't have kids sized shakes for the kids meal."}
{"text":"This place is garbage, i went and ordered and the food was cold when it got to me, which really didnt matter because the burger tasted awful anyway. Service was terrible, it seemed like they were all in a bad mood for some reason! I saw a lot shady figures and not-so-polite staff, except for this one guy Steven, he was the only decent human being there. He actually smiled and was polite! Shocker. I also saw an older guy hitting on wayy younger girls the whole time too which was extremely off putting. I think his name was brian. Weird, weird place. Definitely don't go here."}
{"text":"I wish that I could remember our servers name from yesterday because she was fantastic! The food and selections at Hopdoddy's are really good to start with and the drinks are of quality. Our server went above and beyond and fulfilled our needs ahead of time; we never wanted or had to ask for anything. It was awesome because everyone at the table commented on how exceptional the service was. How often do you hear that?

Twyla and I have been here several times and have enjoyed each visit. The range of burgers that are offered is lengthy and the gluten free options FN rock for my Celiac girl. I have to take care of my gem. Our food was cooked to the proper temps and the buns on our burgers were as soft as a baby's _ _ _ (hangman) or a Charmin roll on your tush. The Truffle Fries bring me back to my San Francisco trip. Napa too. I love truffle fries. 

It is located in a hub of activity. There is nothing you could want for: movies, shopping, eye candy, plastic personalities, coffee shops and I'm sure there must be a massage place close by too. I highly recommend it!

{"text":"Wonderful burgers.  Quality ground beef, perfectly cooked.  Perfect fries, not too oily.  Loved the real sugar throwback sodas, and I don't usually drink soda.  The atmosphere was open, airy, light and inviting."}
{"text":"I love the burgers, the fries and the atmosphere. Great place! A must visit!! I get the classic burger, extra lettuce. Shakes are amazing too."}
{"text":"The bacon cheese burger was delicious just the way it came. My vegetarian daughter loved her veggie burger but my other daughter was very disappointed with her caesar salad (and i can see why). She asked if she could order it with chicken, our first time here, and the guy taking the order said yes. What he failed to tell us is that the chicken would be in the form of a ground chicken patty.  It was horrible!  We also ordered it without the chickpeas but it was left on there. For $11 or any $, it was a big thumbs down. 

We will come back for the burgers for sure. Oh, and if you can make it in between 3-6, they knock off $2 from the burgers."}
{"text":"Man! 
Food was fantastic! Burgers were perfect! 
The service/ordering system are so confusing... it would have been helpful if someone could have greeted us and told us how it worked in there."}
{"text":"Burgers are so trendy these days and you don't find me complaining! The hamburgurlar and I have one thing in common: we both love burgers! It's my cheat food any day of the week. Give me a burger, fries (and maybe even a milkshake) and I'm one happy girl. Granted, I don't eat my favorite meal every day of the week, which is why it's such a special treat when I do. Being a huge fan of Roaring Fork and Salty Sow, I was very excited to give Hopdoddy Burger Bar a try. The verdict? Folks, they did it again! 

Here's how it works: 

There are three ways to enjoy a meal here. You can post up at the bar, you can dine in or you can get take out. Whichever option you chose, you will start by first going up the counter and ordering your meal. If you plan on dining in, once you order, the server shows you to a seat so you don't have to fight other patrons to score a table. The server will then bring the food out to you and you can enjoy your meal! 

Now on to the food. The burgers are why you come here, but they do have other delicious food as well! I especially love the Classic Cheeseburger and french fries, but the cous cous is delicious, as is the Kale Salad with Baby Kale Leaves, Arugula, Feta, Watermelon, Avocado, Sunflower Seeds, Pickled Red Onions and Pomegranate Vinaigrette. Actually, all of there salads looked delicious. While I love the Classic, they also have several funky burger options, such as the Buffalo Bill with Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce, the El Diablo with Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Caramelized Onions, Habanero and Serrano Chiles, Salsa Roja, Chipotle Mayo, an Ahi tuna burger, turkey burger and veggie burger, etc, etc. There's a burger for all palettes here! 

Now let me talk about my other favorite part of the meal. Mmmmm....milkshakes! Oh yes, they have milkshakes here and a.m.a.z.i.n.g ones at that! I had the Nutella and Chocolate pretzel and yes my friends, it's as good if not better than it sounds. I might just stop in for a milkshake one of these days, but then I don't think I could resist a burger to go with it!"}
{"text":"Nice place for burgers and beer. Family-type place. It is a little confusing because you go up to a counter and order and then sit down at a table. It is kind of like paradise bakery. 

They have seem to have a lot a good happy hour specials, not very expensive. I had a margarita and it was really good.

I'm not a burgers and fries type of person, so I won't even comment on the food."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed! We stopped in on Sunday after my husband met someone from Austin and they raved about this place. I get the whole grass fed support local farmers/vendors but the burger lacked flavor. Let's just say Culver's does a better job! My husband had the primetime and I can't even member what I had. The burger falls apart because it is so greasy. When lift to bite into it the grease is dripping off. Not worth the money and will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I won't be back that is assured. The length of my review is commensurate with the dissatisfaction of our experience.  This place blows. Where do I start I'm really confused. Just like when I walked in the door.
My wife and I walk in the door. I see two people waving their arms. I figure that's where I go. When at the counter I state I want fries and a beer. She replies, \"If you get a burger with the beer it's only $10.\" I'm in! Now I go look for a place to sit. But I haven't paid anything. How does anyone know where I'm sitting? Where do I go? A server says, \"where are you sitting?\" \"I dunno.\" What if I sit over there?\" \" You can't sit there you sit at 23.\" WTF is 23? What if I want to sit at 47 or 51 or whatever as long as it's open?
We sit somewhere. Amazingly our food comes and it's correct. How did they know where we sat? We are out of water. My wife gets up to get water twice. No one comes around to see if you need anything, you just go seek what you need; weird.
Our bill comes. Who do we pay? How much to tip? No one did us any favors that's for sure. I didn't pay when ordering, there is no cashier. WTF? The bill is wrong. Order taker lady said a beer and burger was $10. They charged $15. WTF? My wife goes up to question the bill, \"sorry the server didn't get the bill right.\" WHAT? The server had nothing to do with the bill. Your bullshit excuse shouldn't be placed on the server having nothing to do with the transaction. They argue over the bill. Why do they have to argue? They told us one thing and delivered another, bait and switch; no argument should have been had period. 
This place is F'd up. I'm a local and won't go back. I will pride myself in the length at which I will discourage anyone from going here, it is my duty as a consumer. No good words will come from my mouth for certain."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We had the truffle fries, prime burger and the classic burger. It was all very delicious and our server was very friendly. The fries were brought to us first. I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Loved! I got a burger with the Kobe beef patty substituted, and it tasted fresh and delicious. I liked the menu options and my meal was hearty. I also liked that the cashier took her time to explain my options and customize my order. I ended up getting the Kale salad, and it was light with a earthy flavor that I enjoyed. The ginger lemonade was fresh and not out of a can. I enjoyed it and would DEFINITELY return! I was full for almost the whole day and really enjoyed the flavors!"}
{"text":"This is a fun burger bar! I enjoyed it a lot! You grab a menu and you walk straight forward to order your food and then they bring it to you. It is really inviting they have lemon/lime water while you wait which is refreshing. I got full really fast but the burger and the truffle fries were great. The only reason why I'm giving them 3 stars is because it was really hot inside and we found hair in one of fries we ordered."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Hopdoddy is in Scottsdale. I moved from Austin, and this was the place I frequent most. The burgers are simply the best in America. While you wait in line, you can get their oh-so-tasty sangrita and their sweet and salty Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake. Double fisting. 

Check out their Instagram for any special burger of the week/month. 
Sides: You must get their parmesan truffle fries. The sauce it comes with it is to die for as well. You can ask the server for more than one tiny cup. 
Don't forget to also try their different type of condiments with your burger. Chipotle BBQ is usually my go to."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious (especially the impossible burger), drinks are really good. Place itself is very clean and I like the style. My only complaint is that fries don't come with the burger, but this seems to be more and more common now. So for a burger, fries, and a drink I am normally spending close to $30 which is kinda crazy for a fast food style place. That being said, I do keep going back because I love it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for quality burgers but it is truly inconsistent with the way they cook the same burger: the cooking crew is apparently not always the same and once you might get one of the best burgers you had in your life and another time, the same burger is greasy and really not as good...
They should also have a better beer selection."}
{"text":"Really thought this place nailed it. We thought the ordering system is fine and have seen it at other places. We came for an early dinner and were able to find and order fairly quickly. We ordered the impossible protein style, the el Diablo, the Hopdoddy ipa and Parmesan fries. The impossible burger was delicious and I thought really well done considering it's a meat substitute. The el Diablo was also good but the Parmesan fries were really awesome. The servers walking by were friendly and helpful. They have a nice variety of hot sauces however, they had a generic version of siraracha which is made in China instead of Cali which I didn't care for. 

Bottom line..great place for a burger with many different options. Has a fun hipsterish vibe. 

Pros
Impossible burger is great 
Parmesan fries is the best 
Service is good 

Cons
The off brand sriracha was not great!"}
{"text":"The employees are friendly but my food hit the table before I was able to order a beer. The Truffle fries are delicious the burgers are grilled not flame-broiled. My server dropped the check after my third bite... it was okay but I'm not impressed. Pumpkin cheesecake milkshake was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Horrible way to order and pay, burger was ok, guy plating food were wearing plastic gloves but adjusting his baseball hat, so that was gross, pop not great options for diabetics, and the manager was so annoying. The servers were nice and all were willing to help our table of  7, 
45 mins from home, no need to return.
Update, we left cash for tips, but mysteriously ten dollars was added to my daughters bill, she drove all the way back for a refund, shouldn't this be illegal, caution save your receipts and check your account!!!!"}
{"text":"We had family from Canada visiting, and one of their requests was a good burger.  I pulled out my yelp app and Hopdoddy popped up.

Upon entering, I thought I finally found my go to burger joint.  There is a nice bar next to the ordering line with only local beers in tap.  Sweet!  There are televisions placed through out the restaurant playing the nfl playoff game so I was excited to try the place out.  

 The ordering system was a bit confusing.  But we finally settled on the Buffalo Bill ( Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce) with both garlic truffle and regular fries. From there you are assigned a seat.  They took awhile to put our number on our assigned seat.  I had wandered around the place looking for our number awkwardly carrying drinks and condiments before I realized it wasn't placed yet. 

I thought my burger was underwhelming.  It was lukewarm by the time we got it.  The garlic fries were very good.  Everyone else looked like they were enjoying whatever burger they had ordered.  

The employees that worked there were very nice.  They were efficient except for that bit of a wait for our seat in a almost empty restaurant.

My first experience was okay but I something tells me to come back and try something else.  

I give this place a B-  
Due to confusing ordering system, my lukewarm burger, and long wait to sit in an almost empty restaurant"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place for lunch while we were out and about. When we first came in there was no hostess and it was VERY confusing but one of the employees came up to us and I then asked how it all worked. She then said we can sit down at a table then we go order at the register then the server will bring our food to us and anything else we need and we will pay through them as well. Not sure I like this concept but oh well. 

My boyfriend had the clasic burger with cheese and I had the Llano Poblano burger and we shared the truffle fries. The burgers were very tasty and so were the fries. The fries were big enough to share with 4 people! 

The service was reallly good and food was very tasty as well so I'm sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food but order process sucks.  You get all your food at the same time including beverages.  So we waited 20 minutes for beer.  You should be able to order and receive adult beverages while in line near the bar.  Customers would be much happier."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is great place if you are looking for a burger fix or don't have time to sit down for a nice long meal.  You order in line and then you will be seated.  A server will come by for drinks and to deliver your food.  Everything is local and the quality of the beef is amazing!  I usually get the El Diablo as I like the spiciness! The Green chill queso and fries is delicious as well!  The only tip I would give is they typically cook the burgers a little less than what you specify (i.e. if you like medium rare, order medium)."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Fast service! Try the fries and quinoa sides!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Probably one of the best burgers I've had. Always juicy. Ordered 2 burgers, a small order of fries, and 2 waters - $20 bucks"}
{"text":"Sadly the first time I've been to one of these...and we have them in Texas!!  

Staff, restaurant \"vibe\" was on point!!  Beer was super cold (really too cold for in IPA), but a great selection and very attentive bartenders!  WiFi worked great (since I was working), so that was a nice touch!

Burger...got the Llano Poblano, side of fries with the green chili queso...  AMAZING!!!  Burger was on point, perfect amount of seasoning, and cooked to perfection.  Flavors of the chipotle aioli, pepper jack cheese, grilled hunk o poblano and the perfectly crispy bacon married well...I also added caramelized onions and that too it to a new level!

Bottom line, great burger, great staff, and cold beer...hard not to love it!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is delicious!!! I had just a classic burger came out in a tray ordered fries doesn't come as a meal which sucks but the fries were okay nice fun clean atmosphere customer service was great! Will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Always one of my go to spots for a delicious burger. Their Cesar salad is a fave as well. I almost always get the Magic Shroom Burger but recently tried the Lamb burger & was very pleased. I've also had El Diablo & Primetime. I personally think all their burgers are worth a try. The combinations are very tasteful together. I always substitute for Akaushi beef. Medium rare is perfect. 99% of the time we just grab a seat at the bar where you have full menu. Mmmm I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place makes me think of a glass house. Super cool. First, you walk in, and wait in line to order. Meanwhile, someone walks up and assigns you a table. I never understand why it takes people SO long to order. It drives me insane! Anyway, there's several types of burgers to choose which you can customize. 
You know how you walk up to a mall food joint, go to the counter, order your food, then sit down...
So, if I order my food at the front and then wait for someone to bring my food to the table- no server... why is there a line to add tip? Why should I tip when drinks and condiments are self serve?
Burgers are good though. My mood changes for what I prefer. The Greek burger is made with lamb. That's good. I love the Llano Poblano but get it as a turkey burger. 
Also order the green chili queso fries which are awesome. 
Good joint for fresh and tasty burgers."}
{"text":"Nothing like some home improvement to get the appetite going. Although a burger joint, Hopdoddy is non meat friendly. We opted for the veggie burger which was homemade and quite delicious. Also the perfectly cooked tuna burger. Both overflowing with fresh crispy vegetable toppings.
A giant side of fries put this meal over the top. If you haven't been before, you order at the counter and they serve you. Very friendly staff and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but it didn't deliver. Burger was just basic nothing really special and same for the fries. Didn't try a milkshake but I heard they do them pretty well here so maybe next time I will try one but there are many other burger joints in Phoenix I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Not only was the food delicious, but the staff and especially the manager were amazing. The manager, Brian, came by our table to make sure we were having a great time and we certainly were! Would highly recommend this place for dinner and dessert"}
{"text":"Anyone can serve you good food once, but they do it again and again. I'm a fan of the Turkey Burger and the fries, and they always have a new mixed cocktail for you to try.  Last time the bartender mixed two beers for me. Cheers! So good!"}
{"text":"I truly try to hold back on the negative reviews, but our experience at hop daddy was truly awful. 

First, I wish I knew it was cafeteria style. Even though we are only behind 10 people, it took 15 minutes to put our order in, due to only one person taking orders at the cash register.

Next, the receptionist could never get our table right. They gve us a number and others were sitting there. Utter confusion.

Next, our orders came out cold and when we told one of the servers that the meals were Cold, they looked stunned when we asked them to take it back to the kitchen and heat up our meal.

After waiting 10 to 15 minutes to get our order back, we finally decided enough was enough and decided to leave and received a refund. 

All in all, they made the burger bar experience super challenging and we never got to truly even taste a burger. Hopefully, better training and systems will  be put into place as we would like to come back and try the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but overpriced and marginal service.  

$26 for a burger, fries shake and drink.  It was good but not $26 good.

Staff too focused on being fancy and \"special\" instead getting the food right.

I had to repeat my order 4 times just to place it, and the burger still came out wrong.  I told the server that brought it out what was wrong twice.  It came back wrong again.  I had to repeat the correct order to a third person three more times and finally  the third burger was correct.

However by the time i got the correct burger, the fries they brought with the first burger were cold.

Was told they would discount my bill due to the mistakes, no discount given.

The waiter system is very odd as well.  Order at the front counter, food brought by a sort of waiter and you pay the waiter.  Just weird, do not like."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I had!! Great looking interior with quality food. Also had a nice bar that looked good. If you go you have to try the chocolate milkshake. Might have been the best milkshake I had!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Scottsdale hands down, atmosphere is cool and fun, staff is friendly and the watermelon beer on tap is so good! Can't just have one!"}
{"text":"We ate here several weeks ago in search of a non-fast food burger. I decided you can't go wrong with the Classic, so that's what I ordered, along with fries and the Sangrita to drink. The burger did not disappoint. It had great flavor, was juicy, and had the right amount of toppings. It was a little overdone for my taste, however. I think they said it would be medium to medium-well when I ordered; it was definitely well-done. One suggestion: ask for a side of the Sassy Sauce to dip your fries. The cocktail was tasty and generous with the booze.

The biggest detractor was the service. I didn't read the Yelp reviews before we went, but many echo my biggest complaint, which is how Hopdoddy straddles the fence between fast-casual and traditional table service. When you walk in, someone greets you, gives you a menu and assigns a table number. After we ordered at the counter, she gave us a different table number...next to the bathroom. No, thank you. The \"hostess\" sat us at a new table. Our \"server\" came to our table as we finished eating. He told us he didn't realize we moved tables, but he had walked past ours several times, servicing his other tables. After waiting for the check, we flagged him down to ask him to bring it. \"Oh, jeez, I thought I already brought you the check.\" 

A definite big fail on the customer service, but that would not prevent me from coming back, as the burgers and the drinks were great."}
{"text":"Great vibe, friendly staff and delicious  burgers. My hubby had the Diablo and absolutely loved it!   I had the shroomburger and really enjoyed the goat cheese which I've never had on a burger.  I wasn't  crazy about the shrooms but a pass on that as I am picky about mushrooms and the menu said field mushrooms. The truffle fries were amazing, and they had all local craft beers.   Highly recommend this place. Bonus: dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Like its been said before, the set up is a little odd. You walk in & stop at bar to order your drinks then head to back counter to order your food. We went with the Continental (turkey burger) & a standard type burger for my daughter with an order of truffle fries. Price came to $26 with tip. Servers were all very friendly & stopped by periodically to check on us. My turkey burger was very moist likewise my daughters. The fries were almost in edible they were so over salted. Over all cute place, nice concept."}
{"text":"Wish we had a Hopdoddy in Lynchburg.  They are very quick and efficient when placing orders at the counter.  We chose to sit outside as it was a nice night. We ordered the Hail Caesar and the Thunderbird, plus the Nutella and Pretzel Milkshake.   They brought out the food when it's ready, so we got the fries and milkshake first.  Our fries were crispy and delish and didn't last long, neither did the shake.  Hail Caesar was a good twist on traditional and the Thunderbird was very tasty and messy!"}
{"text":"The best Turkey Burger ever! The bun it comes with really makes it work, somehow. Serving system is kinda annoying but it's not bad. Great fries. Nice vibe."}
{"text":"So I've always liked this place for the food. But every time I go there the service gets worse and worse. And I always sit at the bar, so you would expect to get better service. So today I decided to do and take out order. It was easy enough online. We get there and sit at the bar to pick up and there is no bartender. We were sitting there for almost 10 minutes. Then there was a guy who went behind the bar and looked at us. Didn't even come up to us and turned his back and started talking with another employee. My boyfriend went up to the counter. At this point the bartender came back. I told her I had an order and she just turned away to go get it. I was going to ask her for some additional sauces, but she walked away to fast. When she came back I asked her for the mushroom sauce and she just turned away before I could ask her for the chipotle sauce to, do she had to walk back and forth twice and waste our time even more. Like I said I love the food, but the service is horrible."}
{"text":"There must be a foodie-millennial term for trendy. What ever that term is, fill it on as a descriptor of this place. 
I'm greeted by a youthful woman who introduces me to another who hands me a menu and we discuss the food items for a few minutes while standing  in front of the order counter where I was introduced to Alex (another youthful woman) who took my order and pointed me to table 54 - I found it - after filling my own soda. 
My server introduced herself. And asked if there is anything I needed -catchup. Before my server brought my catchup another youthful woman (not my server) delivered my order. Then came the catchup. Great! 
While munching my burger, I amused myself by observing the activities of the staff. All twenty-ish. Lots of swagger, lots of acne. It's early, but there are at least three staff members for every customer and they are eagerly swaggering around trying very hard to maintain their hipster-ness (I guess). 

I get that attitude is what sells these days and that if I have to ask the difference between a Kennebec potato and a, say, Russet ... well I don't deserve an answer. As we oldsters might say, \"PULEEASE!\"

Oh the food. Burger was yummmy. Juicy. Fresh. All as promised. Hand-cut Kennebec fries, well, tasted like fresh  French fries. I liked the Mexican diet cola - not chemical tasting, refreshing. 
I know that this is some sort of \"chain\" and I'm sure they have a formula ... if they're still in business  at this location in a year, I might try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers paired with local beers is the ultimate American lunch and it's perfect on a warm summer day in Arizona. 

My friends and I were looking for the perfect spot for food and booze, one because we were hungry and two, the weather outside made us crave cold and refreshing beers. Hopdoddy met all of our needs. 

Order at the counter and a waitress will provide a table number for you. Present the number to the cashier and wait at your table for the food to arrive. 

All of their burgers sound delicious and taste very fresh. My friends and I ordered the Magic Shroom Burger, El Diablo Burger and the Greek Burger. If you're looking for a nice kick, El Diablo is perfect for you. It comes with habaneros AND serrano chilis, so this is not for the faint of heart. The Greek is your typical Lamb Burger, which comes with feta, argula, tzatziki sauce and pickled red onions. My favorite burger, which unfortunately was not the burger I ordered, was the Magic Shroom burger. Something about mushrooms and pesto just always makes for the best bites. 

Parmesan Truffle Fries are BOMBDIGGITY, and comes with a side of truffle aioli. It's a hefty portion too, perfect for a group to share. 

Their signature sips seem to be a little on the sweeter side. I ordered the mighty mule and had to wait for it to be watered down until I felt comfortable drinking it. However, their craft beers and drafts were perfect and I highly recommend the HopDaddy IPA."}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed here. All the burgers are amazing and the meat is hormone and antibiotic free, fresh fresh fresh! 
Great happy hour from 3-7 and they are doing an AMAZING deal through the end of October that gets you any burger and any local draft beer for only $10. No time restrictions on that deal, open to close! 
I had the Ahi Tuna Burger today: sushi grade tuna, sunflower sprouts, nori chips, teriyaki, honey wasabi, mayo, pickled ginger, red leaf lettuce, white onion and beefsteak tomato. This is a sushi lovers wet dream; dive in! 
Staff is super friendly and very helpful if it's your first time in. (They have counter service or full service at the bar.) They are honest and knowledgeable about everything on the menu allowing you to order with confidence. 
I've sat at the bar a few times w/ Mike behind it; he's the type of bartender I would want working at my family's restaurant. 
If you want to get out of the house to get a great burger (or salad) but still want that neighborhood feel, this is the place. 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"We planned a night out with friends and one of them suggested we eat here. I had never heard of the place and I was slightly disappointed by the suggestion for a night out with friends. I mean, burger place, really! 

To my surprise I truly enjoyed the food. I had the chicken burger with thunderbird fries and I was extremely satisfied. The burger had amazing taste and was extremely juicy. The fries were suggested by the cashier and I'm truly glad I took her advice. I would go back here to eat in a heart beat! 

My only disappointment was the service. The kitchen forgot to make a plate of fries for one friend, and entire burger for another and the bar took 45 minutes to bring a margarita for another. That's the reason I give it three starts. Three HUGE mistakes for one table. The odd part, you order at the cashier and she's punching it all in. The servers only bring you the food. So I'm not really sure how they \"misplaced\" the orders. Great food, service sucks!"}
{"text":"After using the online ordering service, picking up our food and being charged over $20, I will be very reluctant to come back. Online it states all burgers come with a side of fries and after seeing great reviews for their food, it's annoying to come home to find out you didn't get everything as expected and no receipt as well."}
{"text":"Love ... too many burgers to choose from and great beers on tap.  Don't forget the parm fries.  Delish"}
{"text":"The NEW IMPOSSIBLE Burger has arrived. RUN don't walk to fill you pie hole with this delicious slice of heaven. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my, Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"It has been a couple of years since I been to this location but after visiting the location in Phoenix it reminded me that I hadn't review this locale yet. They are pretty much the same but I remember the service at this location being much faster and the Bean Burger I had was absolutely delicious. The fries are a MUST and the Soda combinations are not to be missed. I can honestly say I will be visiting this location very soon to do a more thorough comparison between this one and the location in Phoenix. I will provide an update once I have completed this task.....so stay tuned and remember to Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friend."}
{"text":"The burgers are very high quality and delicious!  Try the shakes - they are great too!  Friendly staff.  $2 off burgers during happy hours - makes the experience ever better."}
{"text":"Still on our quest to find a 'different' burger joint, my wife and I stopped by HopDaddy today to see what all the fuss was about. Maserati parked in the parking lot, no intimidation there. No valet parking. So far so good.

We're greeted as we walk in the door and they explain this bizarro ordering system to us. They asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar, a table or booth. We wanted a booth, so she wrote a number on the piece of paper, handed us some menu's and said we were welcome to take a seat (pointing in the direction of the booth that has a number flag on it) and to walk up to the cashier by the kitchen area when we were ready to place our order. Strange. Its like a Bistro, but not like a Bistro.

The have a large sign saying that they bake they own buns, grind their own meet, and hand cut the fries all on-premises. They even sell bags of 'yesterdays' buns, which still looked and felt very fresh.

Things get really wild when you're asked what you want to drink. Yes, the place is called HopDaddy, so beer would be an obvious choice, so wouldn't Coke or Pepsi also be obvious? No! Here they have a soda fountain that serves Maine Root branded soft drinks. Go on, Google Maine Root soft drinks. I've never heard of them, either. So how am I suppose to pick a drink when I've never tasted any of them before? This is just bad marketing. I'm all for offering customer alternatives, but at least have a Coke or Pepsi fountain machine alongside the alternative! I ended up getting a Mexican Coke, which they sell in glass bottles imported from Mexico (mexico still uses real sugar in their Coke, while Coke is the USA is made with High Fructose Corn Syrup) and they do not taste the same. Coke make with real sugar is much sweeter, like it used to be when I was a kid.

However, it just so happens that Maine Root offers something called \"Mexican Cola\" on the fountain machine. And something else called \"Doppleganger\" which I interpreted to mean 'coke-like.' Doppleganger tasted like RC and Mexican cola tasted like Mexican Coke or Pepsi. The Blueblerry tasted like a lightly flavored water. I didn't try the orange or lemon-lime. What's the point of offering an alternative soda fountain that has all the same flavors the big guys make? Why not offer REAL alternatives to flavors we've never tasted before??? Wouldn't that make more sense? Otherwise, it just appears you are too cheap to get the Coke or Pepsi fountain machine. It might as well have been called Bepsi. Seems more like a financial move on behalf of management, and not a real alternative to the everyday brainwashing we face from Coke and Pepsi dispensaries.

They serve burgers made from Bison, lamb, chicken, turkey and tuna! And a veggie burger as well (though it does have cheese on it.)

Prices are decent, burgers run from $6.50-$12. There is a fully stocked bar, with seats surrounding it, if that's your thing.

Once we ordered at the cashier, she took our little table ticket and gave us cups for our drinks (serve yourself) but everything is full service from here on out. Again, its a bit odd.

The Kennebec fries were delivered to our table almost immediately. They are served on a baking try with wax or parchment paper. Are they baked? No, they are fried. This is just how they are served! The fries are so crunchy, they remind me of potato stix, a snack you can pick up at any grocery store. They are thicker than potato stix, but they crunch and taste just like them. And they were not at all greasy. They decorate them with parsley, which I could do without. But they were very, very, very good! Definitely going to order those again! Regular Kennebec Fries sell for $2.75. That's a bargain!

When our burgers arrived, they were so salty as to almost be inedible. I ordered my burger plain and dry. All I wanted was the meat and bun. That's just what I got, but the salt! OMG! If they would have just left the angus alone, as nature made it, ground it and cooked it, I bet it would have been perfect. But, no, they thought they could do better than nature and completely ruined it. The burger was built loosely, and they offer to cook it medium or medium-well only. I asked for mine to be medium-well. The bun was fresh and delicious. My wife ordered the classic burger (same as me) but with everything on it except a bun, preferring a lettuce wrap instead. Again, far too salty.

Now, during this time, no less than 5 different employees visited our table and asked if everything was okay? If we needed any extra napkins or condiments or refills on our drinks. And we both said everything was fine because I didn't want to make a scene of sending food back for being too salty. Maybe it was a mistake by whoever prepped that night. Maybe we just went on a bad day.

The place is pretty cool, the employees are all very friendly, a fully stocked bar with beer and spirits and wine and the prices were very good for Scottsdale. Our total was $23.25 +$1.85 tax."}
{"text":"For the setup and how seriously this burger bar takes itself, it was just alright. 

Somewhere between a sit down and a fast casual restaurant, I don't like the mix. Paying for your service before you get it doesn't sit well with me. 

While not exorbitantly priced, I don't feel like the burgers and fries were that much better than what I could get across the street at In n Out.

Overall, just an okay experience with some decent burgers."}
{"text":"This used to be such a great place for a hamburger, fries and Coke.  Sadly it is going downhill. Food is inconsistent, service even more so and now they are starting to run out of food on their menu. That's a sure sign they have either lost interest, are under poor management or both.  Fortunately there are plenty of great burger places in Scottsdale to fill the void left by Hopdoddy's demise (see YELP).  No need to tolerate their poor performance."}
{"text":"Really good and consistent food.  We will definitely come back, love the beer mugs !!"}
{"text":"Was at home, craving \"The Greek\" burger. Jumped in my car and drove the five miles to Hopdoddy, sat at the bar, declined the menu the bartender offered me because I already knew what I was having. \"I'm having The Greek,\" I proclaimed! His face shifted to a look of sadness as he informed me they no longer have the item on their menu, but maybe I'd want to try something else? 

What the shit?? 

I begrudgingly took back the menu, simmering. I didn't come all that way for \"something else.\" Oh hey, look ... they revamped their whole menu. They got rid of the eye-catching design of their previous menu, with the unique fonts for each burger. They've switched to a HORRIBLE two column format. No, seriously ... the format of your new menu is not the one you want. It doesn't flow and is confusing to the eye, and ... of f*ck it. You're not going to change things because of my Yelp review. Whoever told you to change things, though, was wrong! Bad, BAD advice. 

It's not my business. 
Do whatcha like. 

I got up and left without ordering anything; disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the greatest burger joints I've ever been too. Service was amazing and over the top. Food was great as well. Recommend the poblano burger and the Parmesan cheese fries. Also the Nutella Pretzel shake was to die for."}
{"text":"This just might be the best burger I've ever had. The parties are thick, but so light and easy to eat. Delicious, fun soda flavors and shakes. Amazing fries too! We need one of these in our home town of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"That is a fang good veggie burger, YUM! My boyfriend and I were looking for a new place to try last night, and originally decided on Taco Haus..which ended up being closed when we got there. So, looking up places nearby he saw Hopdoddy, which I had really been wanting to try. 

One thing that would maybe knock off half a star was we walked in confused, no idea what we were supposed to do because there was no sign or anything! And one lady introduced herself as our server, but like 3 different people were helping us out. Also they sat two of us in a six person spot when it was really busy. It wasn't much of a problem though, just different. The ambiance of Hopdoddy is nice as well, very hip, cool feeling to it. 

I ordered La Bandita with no mayo or cheese. It was excellent, the housemade veggie patty was incredible. And a mess. But worth it! Loved the arugula and pesto on it. The bun was fantastic as well. I got fries for my boyfriend and I as well, and they were tasty. I liked that they had different options for sauces, but I stuck mostly with ketchup for my fries. Was WAY to stuffed for a milkshake, but they looked incredible. The truffle fries sounded awesome too.

Usually my boyfriend and I always try a new restaurant whenever we go out for a meal, but we both agreed we will have to be making a return here. We liked it that much!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We're from California and first tried Hopdoddy's in Austin, TX. We heard it opened in Scottsdale and booked a trip to \"see Grandma.\" We weren't sure if it would be as good as Austin but it was!! Amazing burgers and shakes!! We had the Good Cause and the Llano Poblano burgers and the sea salt caramel, Nutella pretzel, and Oreo with chocolate shakes. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us with our 3 young children (they loved the grilled cheese). We waited about a half hour at 6:30 pm on a Friday night, not bad. Can't wait for it to come to Newport Beach this summer!! Thanks Hopdoddy's!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last Saturday. We suggested it to friends. Huge disappointment. $74 for four burgers and fries. Every single burger and order of fries came out cold. When I approached someone to tell them about it, they just said \"sorry\" and then walked away. We were sorry that we suggested it to friends. We will not be back..."}
{"text":"Ok we loved this place when it first opened. Now today will be our last time!
Today we ordered our burgers and sat down and never saw  a wait staff. Our forks were dirty, our FF were cold and we decided we wanted a beer but that never happened. The burgers tasted great but we have had it with the service. Last time too we asked for ketchup and was told where it was. Got up and got it. Our table was dirty too. The prices have gone up but service is bad. Good bye."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Maybe a bit overpriced, but incredibly delicious.  The craft soda machine is pretty cool too.  I will have to buy a soda next time."}
{"text":"\"One, I want an American cheeseburger...\"

I will play the simple pros and cons game with this one. 

Pros: 


Cons: 
Price
ala carte
grey burger (not flame grilled)
odd seating 
uneducated (about the food) bar tender
no captain morgan at all, only some local Kingman rum (cause kingman is know for the rum)

Seriously the burger was good flavor but the texture and and color were off. I really really wanted to like it. It was a good sized of gray meat. uggh

If you are like me and want a good cheeseburger go to Bobby Q's and get eh Smokehouse burger medium rare. It rocks."}
{"text":"So it's pretty decent ...clean dining area and clean bathrooms...okay customer service based upon how they operate. I walked in prior to them opening however the door was unlocked so I assumed they were open. I sit down at the bar and the bartender says \"we're not officially open but we'll serve you it just might not be as professional\" I would have preferred a different choice of words--or lock the door until you're ready to open. A waiter interrupted her and said he'd take care of me. My meal came and it was incorrect however they fixed it right away,  Parmesan truffle fries could've been at least room temperature especially being 1 of 2 customers in the restaurant so they have the potential to be amazing (based upon other reviewers), burger was cool nothing spectacular but good to know no hormones in the beef, and fantastic milkshake! This is more like an \"upscale\" smashburger with full service bar/happy hour, and occasional check in by several different servers. M
Average priced for the area $22 for fries burger and milkshake"}
{"text":"I come here often.  Standing in line for more than 15 minutes today.  Food is good but I am really second guessing returning based on the lack of concern and good customer service."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Foreigner - Hot Blooded)

It's at, Hopdoddy, check in and see
I got my burger at a medium and rare
Come on Yelpers, do you do more than star?
It's at Hopdoddy, at Hopdoddy

You should read my reviews, to know what I have in mind
Craft Brews you oughta know
Now you taste so fine, let me order it on the line
I wanna go where the milkshakes and the liquors flow

Hopdoddy Burger Bar is also part of the Salty Sow own restaurant cause that's how I got my guitar pick coupon and knew about this place!  They make their own patty and buns here! Dang.......! 

I came with a friend and like most diners, you order in line and get a table number.  My friend order the Tuna Ahi Burger while I went with the Primetime, even though my heart was shooting for the Buffalo Bill - I love Bison!  Needless to say my Akaushi Beef burger was an experiment and it was okay for my palate.  I didn't really care for caramelized onions cause it really overpowered my truffle and brie cheese.  I had a hint of arugula and steak sauce.  I was really jealous of my friends Ahi Burger!  One of the best I've tasted with sweet honey wasabi and crunchy sprouts and nori chips....yummy!  

Overall, food was awesome-good and the ambiance was perfect for a place to hangout for drinks.  They have many hand crafted specialty drinks plus only locally craft brew beers.  The service is on top of their game here.  Really well informed about their products and treated us with royalty.  That's an A+ in my books! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is AMAZING!

I was out there visiting friends in AZ and they took me here which I must say has some amazing selections of both beer and burgers!! 

I wanted something spicy so I ended up getting the El Diablo and man was it spicy! It caught me off guard because I was thinking it would be a normal spicy but not spicy for me since I LOVE spicy, so it turned out to be spicier then I expected, but it was still good!!! It was a perfect combination for me with a nice juicy patty and the right amount of cheese and veggies on it. 

For the fries you should get regular fries and after they bring you your food ask for aioli sauce and they'll bring you the sauce and you don't have to pay extra for the truffle fries. 

They have a wide variety of beers for everyone! They have some local brews on tap which is awesome! 

OH they also have military discount!!"}
{"text":"My first Hop Doddy experience was on So Co in Austin. When I heard they were coming to Scottsdale, I was ecstatic! I love the concept/experience and the food and service are exellent as well."}
{"text":"Hop daddy is a place I recommend when people ask me where to go for a good meal. I tried their vegan burger which was so delicious. Their Parmesan fries are usually good as well except today, fries were soggy. Service is okay, are server made sure we were taken care of. Would have given 5 stars if not for the fries."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed thier Magic shroom burger. I bookmarked this place almost two years ago and forgot about it until the day I finally came in.

I read a few before arriving here about ordering system being a quite confusing and it was in fact confusing for the first timer. I quickly understood the table number system but after I ordered, I wasn't sure if I needed to bring condiment to my table or not.

Server brought our burgers first and they were really good, but I had to slow down on eating as no sign of fries. I had to ask more than twice before they finally brought fries, by then I finished eating my hamburger, and was ready to leave.

Manager stopped by if there is anything else we needed, by then I didn't need anything else. Only if he came before fries arrived...

Too bad I didn't enjoy service as much as I enjoyed my food. I may come back for more good food without expecting much of service."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar has the Impossible Burger! It's delicious but....they don't offer any swaps for not providing vegan cheese and they don't offer Just Mayo or Veganaise.  A So if you want those items bring your own. I tried to get grilled onions instead of fresh however there is a $1 charge for them..... With all of that said the Impossible Burger is amazing and I love that they offer the Maine Root sodas on tap."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger joints in Phoenix. Everything is local/natural. Their burgers range from rare and perfectly seasoned Ahi to a more traditional mushroom Swiss to the spicy side with poblano peppers. The burgers are fantastic and their shakes are a must as well. Try the Nutella pretzel shake and you won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me,start by saying there is really nothing with a lunch at Hopdoddy.  The setting is very hip, the floor to ceiling glass gives it a very airy feel.  The burger was actually very good.  You can tell that it's a quality burger.  I ordered the basic cheeseburger with fries and a drink.  So why the 3 stars.  First, the off brand sodas! I chose the Diet Mexican and it wasn't exactly what I would call appealing.  It left an after taste that wasn't pleasant. Many others may find it tasty.  The burger? As I said, yes it a quality burger.  But I have to say it's nothing extraordinary, in fact I thought it was a little bland.  Maybe the beef was too good of quality for a burger, that rendered it rather meh tasting.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad burger.  The fries were the thin kind which I like and they were pretty good, tasted more like chips.  The other point I have is that for $15.00 (and that's probably the cheapest combo you can get) I expect to be wowed, and I'm sorry to say that didn't happen."}
{"text":"New establishment in a good location.  Interesting selection of gourmet burgers.  Long line to stand in to wait and order before sitting down.  Fresh prepared burger delivered to the table cold.  If entire party doesn't arrive at the same time there's little chance of actually eating at the same time.  Inefficient workflow with high price.  Do not recommend unless you are able to be first in the door when they open."}
{"text":"soooo good. 

I ordered the magic shroom burger. Delish. Amazing combo, great portion. If you like a good, hearty burger patty, this is your place. 

I also ordered the salted caramel shake - which was really really good. The only thing was it was a pretty small serving for the hefty pricetag. 

All in all - I will be back to try other flavor profiles."}
{"text":"First note that what I need in a restaurant is pretty specific.  Good food of course, but more important than that for me is the timing.  Every weekday I leave work, pick up the little one from daycare, call a restaurant for dinner pickup, and pull in the driveway as my wife is getting home so we can all have a nice family dinner.  I have probably 6-8 restaurants in the usual rotation, but am always looking to add more good ones.

I called Hopdoddy last night from the car for pickup, and was told by the manager who may have been named Brandon that they don't do call ahead orders, but he said if I came in and ordered it would be ready in 10 minutes.  My kid is 2, so waiting in a restaurant is near the top of my list of things I like to avoid, but at this point I was already in the car, so even if I stopped for a fast food it would take almost 10 minutes, so what's the harm in the extra couple minutes?  Fine, we'll give it a shot.

So to begin, 8 minutes alone in line.  I wasn't purposefully timing it, but thanks to a phone call ending as I got there compared to the time on my receipt, the timing was done for me.  I don't blame the restaurant for this part; they have two registers to order from, but one of them was taken up for most of that time by a couple in their 80's who must have decided this was the first time they were going to order food from anywhere, or they just liked to small-talk, I'm not sure, but they took forever.

The part that really got me was that we waited 20 minutes after ordering for our food to come out (thanks again to the time on the receipt for helping me track this one).  I don't like smoke being blown up my butt by anyone, but 20 minutes with a hungry toddler is much, much more than double the headache of 10 minutes with a hungry toddler, so don't tell me 10 minutes if it's going to be 20.  Then to top it off they bring the food on 'for here' plates, despite the two places they had indicated it was take out, combined with the fact that they seated us at their mini booths specifically for take out orders, so we then had to wait while they packaged it up.

Unfortunately this place has worked its way out of the rotation based solely on the fact that they don't take call ahead orders, hopefully that new burger place opening up by Pita Jungle does now that Indulge has sadly closed down."}
{"text":"Burger was awesome. I had the frito chili burger. The group has the Greek. El diablo and continental. The chocolate stout shake. Chili cheese fries. 
Very good. Yummmm!!"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is always a great go to for a great burger and brew. I wish this place wasn't a chain, but it sure doesn't act like one.

Why go there: 
Their menu is straight forward and simple. They have a great variety of burgers made with quality meat (since they ask you for a preferred temp). The array of burgers should please the foodie as well as the picky eater. The brews are mostly local and served frosted chalices. They fries come in a generous cone and their soda machine carries craft sodas. It's a good switch up from the normal Coke or Pepsi products.

Don't miss:
I would suggest to pair up a good burger with the right beer. They do serve up a mean truffle aioli ask for that even if it doesn't come with your burger and fries. The shakes are also very well done. Big enough to share between you and yours.

Tip: 
Keep cool with the seating system. It's a bit of a different approach, but they make it work. If you get a beer, have them hold it until your food comes out if you want the full effect. The Orange Blossom on tap is wonderful served in that frosty chalice of theirs."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent! Beer is awesome! But even better the service is amazing! If you want a great burger with really good beer this is the place! Clean and everyone is nice! Perfect to bring the kids!"}
{"text":"This is a 4 because I'm tough. I like it...in fact I liked every bit of it. However it's a burger so no matter how perfect it's not a 5 star for me. Just can't.

Anyway here's the MEAT of the review. I sat in the little booth at the bar...and Crista was the bartender. Super sweet and on it. She even waited to put in my drink order so it hit happy hour. Thanks girl. 

I ordered the St. Germain cocktail and it's delicious. Simple. Clean and a nice break from a burger.
 
I was between the mushroom burger and the Diablo and thanks to Crista I got the shrooms...so so so good. Cooked perfect. Delicious. But what kind of burger place serves their burgers without a side....it's 3$ up charge for a small fry. 

However, they are so yummo. I love a skinny crispy fry. My favorite! Also seasoned well. Try the house ketchup and the truffle aoli. Yummy!

Good little spot. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Cool building, burgers good, fries good. Gluten-free bun was soggy and crumbly and fell apart, its not hard to get a good gluten-free bun these days. The ketchup tasted sweeter than normal, so i assume it was some off brand.I expected more, there are a handful of places that I'd rather go that don't have bad sexual innuendos on their employees tshirts."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place.  The decor is great and the service is super friendly.  I had the poblano burger and it was cooked perfectly.  They have mostly local beers on tap and I enjoyed the two different IPAs that I tried last night."}
{"text":"Only three stars and it's for the food since there service was terrible. No one should have to wait 20 minutes for their check. My water was never refilled. Are you waiting tables or not. Won't be back since the service is rotten. Even though I wanted to take my husband because he loves burgers and I wanted to try more. Sorry. Get it together. It was lunch and not that busy."}
{"text":"YUM!!  I'm a big fan of Hopdoddy and I can't wait to go back many many more times.  This was my 2nd visit and it did not disappoint.  Here are the highlights...

- Ambiance is cool, modern and low key.  High top tables and outdoor seating are a plus

- Experience is casual but can be annoying since you stand in line to order and then they bring it to your table 20 minutes later.

- Happy Hour - go after 9pm for great deals!  Or before 6pm if your schedule permits

- Food - Ahi Tuna burger is delicious!  You can't go wrong with any of the options.  You can get any meat on any of the burgers so there are a ton of options.  If you like spicy - then go for the ones with poblano peppers!

Milk shakes!!! Do it. Unless you're trying to be healthy. Even if you are. Just do it"}
{"text":"Bit awkward checking in as they hand you a menu and you stand there and read it. My wife likes to read the menu front to back then ask me what I think she should get. Besides that everything else was fine. Great burgers, cold beer and very good service. Highly recommend if you want a burger."}
{"text":"This place is not your typical fast casual.  Its really caught in between being fast casual and sit down.  Its actually very confusing and that is my only complaint.  I wish they would pick what they want to be.  A hostess greets you, gives you menus, and points you in the direction of where you can order.  You can also have a seat at the bar, I think, it wasn't very obvious if that was an option.  So once you do figure out what you want, you order from in front of the open kitchen.  If you order soft drinks they give you a cup so that you can get your own from a fountain machine, if you've ordered beer or drinks they have a waiter bring it to your table.  Then another part, which I didn't like, they assign you a seat and point you in the right direction.  Very odd, why can't I pick my own?  When you sit you are met by a waiter who handles everything from there.  They bring you your drinks, your food, any condiments or extras your need.

As for the food, it was great!!  I had the Buffalo BIll, the bison burger, which was really good.  They told me how it would be prepared, medium rare and you can tell them more or less.  My wife had the Ahi tuna burger which was sushi grade tuna pan seared on each side.  Both burgers and additional topping were fresh and really put together well.  Buns are baked fresh daily and it showed, very fresh.  The best part was the truffle fries side, wow, I could eat those all day.  The soda was very crafty as well, Maine Root company sodas, well above the quality of coke or pepsi.

I would stongly suggest going during Happy Hour, which lasts until 6:30 pm on a weeknight, didn't pay attention to what other days or times it was.  You get $2 off every burger, and the basic craft beers cost only $5 (instead of $6), and you get the side of truffle fries for $5 instead of $6.95.

I will return, but the odd order/sit/eat/waiters but order at counter did throw me off.  I have to go back for the shakes, they looked pretty good, and I have to know if they live up to Shake Shake's."}
{"text":"Best chilli cheese burger EVER!!!!!!!

Super cool layout, great menu, excellent beer selection. I just wish I lived closer so I can go more often! It is definitely a place to take out of towners to show that AZ can rival other states with cuisine."}
{"text":"Best burger in Scottsdale! Great bar. Super friendly staff. What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"My husband and I have added Hopdoddy to our rotation of favorite restaurants.... not a good thing for our waistlines, but it's worth it.   We usually start by splitting the spinach/arugula salad, then he gets the Classic Burger while I love the Goodnight burger, along with a shared small order of fries.  Consistently excellent, every single time, and consistently delicious - quite possibly the best burgers we've ever had.   Realize we could make it a bit healthier by each of us ordering a salad first and then sharing a burger and skipping the fries, but our good intentions always seem to cave right as we're giving our order.  Maybe next time : )   My husband LOVES the cold beers; wine list is okay but could benefit from a bit of an upgrade.  The only thing I really don't like about this restaurant is the ordering system.   Like many other people have commented, we figured out early on to just sit at the bar so we don't have to stand in line, and since we avoid peak hours, we're usually able to get a seat.  Even so, it's not as comfortable as a table/booth would be, and while the bartenders are very attentive, there's not a whole lot of ambience - especially when you're looking at a line of people on the other side of the bar waiting to place their order.   The whole set-up just seems very odd, very awkward, and very inconvenient..... just kind of a crummy way to start what is otherwise a great dinner out.   Also seems a bit odd to have milkshakes offered as a dessert.... the ONLY item offered as dessert.   Just as well, I guess, that there isn't a more interesting/enticing selection to choose from, given how many calories we've already ingested up to that point; it just seems like a bizarre choice to have as your one and only dessert.  

Having said all that, what do I know - obviously their formula works, because the place is consistently packed.   If I was reviewing it strictly on their salads and burgers, I would definitely have given it a full five stars, and I don't doubt that's the secret to their success - consistently top quality, delicious food.   The inconvenience of the ordering system isn't enough to keep us away.   We just ate there last night and I'm already anticipating our next visit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is only a few months old. It is located in the old Lonestar Steak House on Scottsdale And Mescal.  When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted, given a menu, and told what table you will be at. You then get in line and place your order. We had the classic Cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and a sassy sauce which I had on the side. It is a ketchup, horseradish sauce and honey mustard. The honey mustard flavor is over powering so I am glad i got it on the side. The regular fries are tasty, crisp and not greasy. The bun on the burger is a brioche bun. The burger was cooked just the way I ordered it. My only objection is that I had a gift card which I tried to use but there was a problem with their system and I could not use it until they check into the problem. I was later told by a worker there that hey have had a number of problems with the gift cards. Someone needs to work on that. They have a greek burger with Lamb, Feta, onions, various other burgers and salads."}
{"text":"Exceptional burger joint!    Buffalo Bill's been my favorite, but I've had several!     Different order and seating process, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this afternoon for a bite to eat with family from out of town, with hopes of showing them an awesome place to eat. However... I was wrong. We came in and sat down at a booth, before almost immediately being told to leave because the hostess was too busy paying attention to her phone to notice that we sat down without her \"permission\". Y'all struck out on this one... we're going to take our business to NYPD pizza. 

I don't think I've ever been told to leave a booth after sitting down in an open one."}
{"text":"Meh.
I'm a bar fly so the weird service aspect never really affected me. I roll in, plop in a barstool, game on.

The service was very mediocre both times I've gone. 

The bartender I had the first time seemed very aloof, not friendly. Some of the other staff were however, which seemed strange. I had a couple of beers and an appetizer and though it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special.
My second visit I had the El Diablo burger and a couple of cocktails. Both were quite good, but again the staff did not at all seem like they wanted to be there, no smiles, fairly inattentive. I had opportunity to mention this to a manager and was accused by them of seeming annoyed, which was exceptionally odd. 

Overall, there's really nothing that would cause me to return. If you have low expectations this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is a high end burger bar.   While you will pay for it, the burgers are stupendous and the service is also terrific.   Best burger joint we have been to in Scottsdale.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place! I'm not a burger person, but this place sure has me coming back! I love the chicken burger (it's a subbed patty on the continental sandwich).....& the truffle fries. Hands down the best. So. Good. 
The service is weird... kind of an identity crisis between burger joint & restaurant... but the food outweighs the bizarre service component. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What's up with your service?  Tonight, I'm walking into Hopdoddy and two young ladies are walking out.  One asks me:  \"Where can we go for some food around here? We're from out of town and this place won't work.\"  I directed them up to Kierland or Scottsdale Quarter.  No worries, right?

So I walk in and the restaurant is busy but not slammed, not even close.  There are probably 6 or 7 empty tables and there is a line of about eight people.  So I wait 5 minutes and the line doesn't move. 10 minutes and the line is down to six people.  The cashier walks away.  So now there is a line of six people and no cashier and several other Hopdoddy employees just standing around.  Really?   I'm there 10 to 15 minutes and the line doesn't really move. The cashier looks like it's the first time he's seen a cash register and I now know why the two young ladies bailed on Hopdoddy.   I did too.  

I could understand if they were slammed and if the other staff members showed any interest at all in helping the lone cashier (I kinda felt sorry for the kid; he seemed to be the only one working).  I could tell that had I stuck around and waited, I don't know how long in line, that this visit was going to be a cluster. 

Why 2 stars?  Because in the past the food has been pretty good, although the last time I actually ate there the service was really pretty poor.

Will I go back?  Dunno.   They were great in the past but they are slipping..... for sure."}
{"text":"Recently went here for a birthday treat. I have driven by it many times and each time it is packed! I ordered the Classic burger, my husband ordered the Buffalo Bill, and we split an order of truffle fries. I also ordered a yard of Hefeweizen. The beer was perfectly cold, and served in a huge frozen mug. I would return to HopDoddy for the beer alone! 
The burgers were juicy and flavorful.. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim,with friend this week for the first time. The place was a little confusing, but the staff explain how it works, easy enough. Only having about 15 mins left for HH, We sat at the bar, which is wait service. I had the Buffalo Bill burger, and shared the truffle fries. The burger was great, cooked perfectly. My friend and enjoyed the truffle fries as well. HH is definitely the way to eat here."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my dining experience.  The service was terrible, they mixed up my friend and my orders and when we requested for them to fix it we received attitude in return.  This place is also over priced for the quality of the food.  I ordered the black bean burger which was ruined by the excess amount of goat cheese and awkward sauce.  Next time I have a craving for a burger I will definitely go back to smashburger instead."}
{"text":"Great burger and truffle fries was finally able to get my boyfriend here and he loved it! Ordering is a bit different but food was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Kudos if the burgers are really from beef 'humanely' raised.  That being said, the burgers were small and greasy and not worth the $8-$12. It was after the lunch rush, about 1:15 and the service was quite slow.   Parmesan truffle fries were quite tasty but tedious to eat as the fries were so thinly cut and short in length. (I do prefer me a thick fry). It's nice having a full bar as an option, but there are plenty of way better burgers in town. I wouldn't choose to come back."}
{"text":"I still love you.... the flavor of your burger still hits the spot when I crave for some gooood burger. Only feedback, the burger looked small. I guess it was just the bun. However, it made the whole burger looked small. It looked like the middle child between a slider and your regular burger. Don't get me wrong, I still love you :)"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. The food and drinks were very good but the service was amazing! Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"Um, uh, err. After reading the reviews, I wanted to try this place. Unfortunately, it was during lunch time and that was like going to Disneyland during Spring or Summer break. The line was at the  and seemed like it never moved.

I finally left after waiting almost 45 minutes. Maybe, one day I'll go back and have the chance to decide for myself it it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"On my last visit I got the pleasure of tasting the black bean burger and ordering a prime time burger and a cold glass of pv sweet tea. The prime time is one of their flagship burgers being the most expensive. I don't think this burger is that amazing compared to their less expensive ones. I've had their lamb, ahi and shroom burger which were absolutely phenomenal. In other words more expensive doesn't mean better! 

They're pv sweat tea is delicious! They even make their own lemoncella. 

Keep up the great work Hop Doddy!"}
{"text":"Upscale burger joint. Friendly staff and patient with people never been here. Get in line and order food. Sit down and food brought to you. Staff will come by to check on you. Very nice atmosphere. Food was really good. They offer truffle fries if looking for that. Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was taste and cooked correctly. The only complaint would be that they were out of 2 items we ordered first. It is a bar and you are out of beer."}
{"text":"It was a good burger, a little to buttery on the bun.  Drinks are cheap which made up for it.  Fries were good but a little over cooked.  Great kid environment"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in months due to them consistently messing up my order at this location. Have learned if I want a medium burger... order a med rare one.  The guy at the register was AMAZING!  Love him. 
On another note... Tonight our server was supposed to bring us a wheat bun cause we got a white one... the restaurant was totally dead... still took at least 15min to get it!!! Had to find someone else to get my sons milkshake. Everyone else in the restaurant helped us but her. First time I've never left a tip. Don't think we'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome service! Love their food. Get the lamb you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. The burgers are good, but don't waste your time. Go straight for the seared ahi tuna burger. Leave your house now, and go. Don't waste time on sides either. Just get another burger. Shakes are great too. Pretzel Nutella or tres leache/ Oreo is the way to go. Did I mention the seared ahi tuna burger? Go try it already."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. No one greets you at the door. You must find your way to the back to order. The food is dreadful!!!  The burger came with canned chili on it. It was inedible, overcooked hockey puck. I ordered medium but no one came back to check on anything so just left. No one said goodbye or thank you. This place will not be open very long and they don't deserve to be!! I've had much better at a fast food place for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"I heard this place was good and it didn't disappoint. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. Everyone was very attentive and helpful since it was my first time. I really like the ordering style also - you walk up and order while they setup a table for you - very clever. Burger was amazingly delicious and truffle fries were yummy! I definitely recommend this place and plan to go back soon."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is a great hang out place. The bar is great.... Happy hour is the place to be with $4 margarita and wines. 

The burgers are the best. The bun is so soft and moist.... 100% angus beef! Hell yeah..... You can substitute any meat with turkey. 

This is my new hang out burger spot with the friends on a Friday night!!!"}
{"text":"food was good.  i always get the prime-burger or something like that.  only con is that the staff isnt very nice.  Theyre civil, but i dont feel like theyd go an extra mile to help you out."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I'm not sure I like the system of waiting in line to order/sit-down, but then still having to wait for the check at the end. 

Almost all of what they offer are meaty burgers, but they do have one black bean patty option, or you could get a salad without the meat. Two options for kids: simple little burger or grilled cheese. 

Don't come here without ordering fries. And beers come in a nice cold goblet!"}
{"text":"Upon my first visit to this eatery, I found the food tasty and the service was acceptable.   But I wasn't pleased that they charged my credit card more than I had signed for.  Also noticing that maybe they go with the noted gratuity on the bottom of the slip but that didn't prove correct either.   I have tried for a month to get this matter resolved but am not able too.  I am assuming that loosing one customer is not that important. DL"}
{"text":"So sad to write this review but I will never be returning to Hopdoddy. Love their food... Huge advocate for them in the past...but no more. I went in today to a relatively slow lunch crowd...proceeded to the front and ordered two burgers and one fry for the table of 2. Sat ... Waited ... 15 minutes later ask our \"server\" what was taking so long to which she replied I know...not sure what is going on with the kitchen it's been like this all week. She then left the table. Another 10 minutes .... Still no food. We get up and find her and ask... Where is our order.... She does not come back and we watch her delver shakes and sauces to other tables. Another 10 minutes.... People behind us getting their food... I got up again and walked over to her. Asked her to pack our food to go and I wanted a refund...she graciously reminded me I hadn't paid so I told her let me know when our food is done and we will take it to go.  She does not follow up... Manager or some young guy comes out to her and asks what is going on... She tells him \"they don't want to pay\" to which he responded \"if they don't pay they don't get their food\" I looked at them both and we walked out.... The young guy did nothing to follow up and neither did our waitress. I don't care how good the food is I will not return on pure principle. Absolutely awful 42 minute experience."}
{"text":"I go to Deluxe for awesome hamburger, but this place is amazing, too!  Fresh ground Angus beef...  It is like the ultimate burger that you'd grill...  Perhaps, better?!!!"}
{"text":"Warning: I'm pretty much a vegetarian!  I do eat fish on occasions (so I've tried a bite of the ahi tuna burger), but please realize my review is biased. 

Let me tell you - the salads here rock!  I like the Caesar salad the best - topped with fried potato straws and chickpeas!  Yum!!  The strawberry arugula salad is also pretty amazing, but a little too sweet for my salad tastes. 

They have a nice beer list and serve them in frozen mugs - they really hit the spot. Also the fries are to die for. 

Not the nicest place in town or the cheapest...but it does the trick!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah cheers for hopdoddy,  I didn't know they were from Texas until my friend who I took today told me. you go up to the bar, order your grub and they bring it you. Nice vibe, good beer and milkshakes,  tho not at the same time!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, kid friendly and cold drinks.  Perfect neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday as my boyfriend told me this place was the best burger place ever. I got the Buffalo Bill burger and wow.... SOOOOO delicious. I ate the whole thing and that is rare for me. On top of that we both got some fries (one of which was free because we forgot to order two fries). Those were awesome as well. We drove up from Tucson for this place and it was so worth it. Keep doing what you do Hop Doddy."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burgers, you won't be disappointed, but I think Zinburger is better on a few fronts. The few times I've been to Hopdoddy, I've waited in line for 15+ minutes to simply place my order.  I'm OK with this concept for a casual lunch, or at a place like Chipotle, I get the self serve concept, but for dinner, I'd prefer to be waited on and have a server take my order. Also, while the burgers are good, they don't blow me away. The truffle fries at Zinburger are tastier too. Truth be told, not a bad place, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I really like this place even though its a bit crowded most of the time. Expect sound pollution, but we usually sit outside and enjoy our food. I like their lamb burgers and fires."}
{"text":"Many of my friends have recommended this place so I met up with a friend who lives in the area for lunch.  I, of course, was late.  We were given the quick tour of how the place works and were able to get one of the last remaining tables.

I ordered the Ahi tuna burger and the truffle fries.  I thought the tuna was done perfect but many folks would have say it was a bit too well done and my friend said it looked so rare she would not have touched it. She had a cheese burger, very well done, and fries and she liked it.  A word on the truffle fries, they were very good but the order is large enough they need to be shared.  I took over half the order home with me.

Every body on the staff we dealt with was friendly and knowledgeable.  They really fill up for a weekday lunch but it did not hurt the service quality or timing."}
{"text":"This place is very chill. Burgers were fresh and fries were perfect. They don't have a normal fountain soda selection, which we didn't mind. I tried the orange soda and was very pleasantly surprised! We'd def go back. We weren't there for happy hour, but it seemed to be a nice hh menu available. High chairs were available too."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot...had the chicken burger and an order of fries. The chipotle ketchup is everything!! Friendly bartender (we sat at the bar)."}
{"text":"Its Sunday night all our plans fizzled out and no dinner was being cooked so the only option was to hop on over to Hopdoddy (ok it wasn't the only option but who is going to argue with me?)

My party consisted of some picky eaters, my oldest daughter her 16 month old son, and my son. 1st question my son has is how do I even know where this place is at, I just answered him one does not ask these things of mom's just know I know things haha.

We walked in and checked out the menu and ordered where placed.

Daughter went with The Classic Burger plain just beef, cheese, BACON pls cooked well, that's how she rolls

Son ordered The Goodnight burger: Angus beef, cooked med rare, with Tillamook cheddar cheese, hickory bbq sauce, caramelized onions slices & jalapeno & sassy sauce, and that burger didn't last long at all, poof it was gone

After some flip flopping on what to pick I settled with the Thunderbird, it's organic chicken burger with roasted poblano chili, cheese, BACON and avocado, it's amazing with the perfect amount of heat!

Also for kicks we ordered Kennebec fries & Truffle fries, my son loved the truffle fries, said he felt fancy eating them, I enjoyed them as well!

Almost went home without a shake, but nope we ordered a few before we left, I went with the Caramel & Sea Salt Shake, this is the perfect combo of a salty sweet and great treat on a hot June night, my son went with the raspberry white chocolate and I guess it was good, he wouldn't share haha. 

The El Diablo is calling me so I know I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wasn't in the mood to cook dinner so I grab the boys and off we went to Hopdoddy Burger Bar.

I started off with a black cherry lime aid with some Hendricks gin, this is nice little drink!

Ordered us some parmesan truffle fries with truffle aioli, these were some great tasting fries! 

For my burger if you will, I went with the Thunderbird, it's a chicken burger with apple smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, avocado, poblano chili, pico de gallo and chipotle aioli. OMG this is my favorite burger from Hopdoddy! SO dang good!!!!  You really can't go wrong with any of burgers there, my second favorite is the Ahi Tuna Burger and 3rd and 4th runners up are the Llano Poblano and El Diablo! So good!

To top of this great tasting meal I ordered a Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel shake, it's the perfect blend of salty sweet! 

If you are looking for a great tasting burger, go give Hopdoddy a try!"}
{"text":"Came with mama and we both enjoyed the hip environment and the food too!  At first we were a little not sure what to do.  Full service?  Got order?  Grab a table?  Then we were greeted and explain the process.  COOL!  We ordered, got sat, and got our drinks.  I ordered the the class burger with cheese.  Mom ordered the Magic Shroom Burger.  We shared an order of the truffle fries.  It was very good.  Burgers were juicy not dry.  Food was HOT when I came to the table.  NICE!"}
{"text":"Came here with  family of four. Everybody ordered a difference burger and everyone loved it. Great fries and sauces"}
{"text":"Last delicious meal before major oral surgery. So thank for Hop Doddys! #lastmealheaven #llanapablanoburger #chilecheesefries #hungryagain 

Went early and ate dinner wth the senior citizens!! We're getting olds. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries were good, burger was \"ok\" - very dry. Beer was cold no issue there. But the service was very poor. Took them 10+ mins to even acknowledge us at the bar, forgot our fries later, forgot ketchup. I have experienced this at their north Scottsdale location as well. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This should be an updated rating. I used to eat here quite frequently.  But ever since December, they can't get it right. Every time we go they mess up one or both of our orders, sometimes more than once. This has happened three times in a row. They are just not paying attention."}
{"text":"the first thing that popped up on my mind when i read the name of this burger joint.

I said a hip hop the hippie
the hippie to the hip hip a hop and ya don't stop 
A rock on baby bubba to the boogety bang
bang the boogie to the boogety beat.... 

just in case you have no idea what i am referring to. it's rapper's delite by def squad

ordered:
*truffle fries-this is a must if you are a truffle fry fanatic or if you love yourself some good fries. it totally did not disappoint one bit. YUM! i totally highly recommend this! 
*red velvet milk shake- when i saw it on the menu it was calling my name! i couldn't resist that red velvet temptation. was it delicious? it was okay actually. i wasn't disappointed but i also wasn't super impressed. 
*classic burger-made perfectly medium. has everything in it that a true classic burger should have. no complaints. 

how it works:
*order first
*pay at register
*they'll bring the food out to your table.

one of the best meals i've personally have had in arizona. service was good as the server does come by to check up on us. you can pay extra to get other toppings i.e. avocado, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, another patty, etc. i saw a staff open the doors for customers and greeted them. upon my entry i was asked how many was in my party and have i dined with them before. as i said no i was provided a quick overview of how hopdoddy is with some burger suggestions. staff all were very nice and i can't complain! 


tips:
*tips is shared equally to all staff.
*has their own private parking lot.
*cash and credit card accepted.
*serves alcohol
*indoor and outdoor seating
*unique fountain drink options. 
*gift card are available."}
{"text":"This is probably the best burger bar in AZ, possibly the west coast. El Diablo burger is out of this world, by far the best I've had in years. On their opening day it was really spicy, but hasn't been that spicy since then. Either way, they will try to scare you, but really it's not all that hot. 

They picked such a great location and I suspect this place will continue to be as packed as it has been in the past few days since opening up. I love the decor and ambiance they got going there.

The fries are great as well. Very fresh and not overly salty. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that they don't have traditional simple desserts. Who has room for a shake after a burger? I never understood that trend.

Also worth mentioning is the truly awesome customer service. I don't know if it's because they just opened, but it seems like they have A LOT of people working there. Which is great, they're all nice and eager to help you out.

Next I plan on trying other burger combinations as well as their grass-fed patties."}
{"text":"Very good food, the thing to remember is that it's all fresh, which means it's pricier than most burger places and the portions a little smaller. However, they grind their own meat, bake their own buns etc... so they make higher quality food.

I had the Greek burger, it was a little light on flavor. A Lamb burger's sauce should be more pronounced. But it was still great because the fresh flavors were satisfying none the less. 

The truffle fries are great, and the aioli  sauce was very garlicky, but in a very good way. 

All in all it was a great experience. The staff is nice and normal, the food is crafted and presented professionally and the environment is inviting."}
{"text":"What really makes a burger so wonderfully great is the love that was put into it when in the making. I don't usually crave a burger, but when I do I go to In-N-Out for my cravings fix. This time around, I decided to give this place a try. Let me tell you... I wasn't disappointed not one bit!

My husband and I decided to come here on a Friday night. It was pretty busy but we had our order taken quickly and efficiently. The staff is wonderful and so friendly!

I ordered the 'Poblano' burger and it was the juiciest burger I have ever had. Every thought process that was taken to perfect this burger showed in every bite I had. The buns were extra soft yet supported the rest of the ingredients to perfection! The peppers were perfectly cooked (not soggy) and left a great crunch with every enjoyable bite. Also, as a side order we got the parmesan truffle fries. OH MY! Those were to die for!!! They were served with a black truffle butter on the side which complimented the fries to perfection.

The way it works is you order at the counter and they give you a number and a table. The serve the food to you and you are greeted with wonderful staff members that make sure you have a delightful experience. 

I will definitely be back here in the near future!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan :)  I love the bartenders and management here, and it's the perfect place to grab a drink and bite to eat.  Nothing too fancy, but great burgers and laid back atmostphere!  (Just sad they got rid for my shake, but I understand I'm basically the only one who ordered it!)"}
{"text":"Nice array of upscale burgers & funky milkshakes, with a full bar loaded with local craft beers? Umm... yes, please. My daughter's favorite new joint. Went there last night with the extended family and a friend. My Goodnight burger was just as I ordered it, juicy & delicious, the bbq sauce and sauteed onions were a great blend. Helpful hint -- add bacon. Always. To everything. Fries were crisp, salty and lightly herbed. Family enjoyed their Lamb burger, Ahi Tuna \"burger\", Llano Poblano and entree salad (?). Four Peaks Hop Knot on draft or San Tan Hop Shock; both great. Solid service, lively atmosphere. A great all-around time."}
{"text":"Omg so delish! The beverage bar was amazing, lots of choices for flavored pop, and the shakes there are amazing! I took my kids there, we all ordered some burgers and fries, and it was all so great! The staff is steller, and the place is all around the best restaurant for families!!! Love love love"}
{"text":"Beautiful Sunday afternoon 8 get it , but what I don't get is a line 20 + people deep and only ONE REGISTER OPEN !  WTF ?  Great way to loose a load of customers in a heart beat !   No sure if any manager really cares because they would of been all over this in a heart beat. PAY FOR THE EXTRA  HELP AND you will have better customer service !"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this is like Christmas in your mouth. I'm very impressed with this place. Quick service. Amazing Kennebeck home made fries, truffle fries, buns, and burgers. Everything is organically made and made fresh. It's like a chipotle for burger places. Hormone free, antibiotic free, etc...."}
{"text":"Well who doesn't love this place?! It is amazing! 5 stars all the way! The burgers are delicious and I really can't pick my favorite. The truffle fries are a must, and every time we come here we totally pig out! 
Also the caramel sea salt shake is perfection in a cup!! :) 
It can be pricey for a burger, but we are talking top quality ingredients cooked to absolute perfection every time. 
When my boyfriend and I go we share a burger, fries, drink, and shake, which comes to about $30 for both of us. So sharing a meal is perfect for us because it is a ton of food! 
I enjoy this place SO much! They are very sweet here as well and keep the line organized and moving swiftly! :)"}
{"text":"Good

1. Nice atmosphere 
2. Excellent burger selection 
(Including vegetarian option)
3. Good quality ingredients 
4. Nice selection of sides and drinks

Not So Good

1. Prices are a bit high especially since fries or side salad is not included in burger price.
2. Assigned seating. I would prefer to sit where I am most comfortable.
3. Kind of loud in the restaurant.
4. Please Hopdaddy, turn up the A/C I don't like eating and sweating at the same time.

Overall, my visit to Hopdaddy was pretty good and I may return when I feel like splurging since it is a little out of my price range for burgers and fries."}
{"text":"The food at HopDoddy is good, but we are always disappointed with the customer service.

The first time we went we ordered two burgers, fries, and a milkshake. We get to our table and everything comes out except the fries. We of course asked the food runner and he said didn't order fries. We didn't have the receipt to confirm and the cashier said we didn't order them so they asked us to go stand in (the long) line again to pay for more fries. It wasn't even worth it at that point... but it just says something about a restaurant that they won't even take your word and bring you fries you paid for. 

We waited a long time before giving HopDoddy another chances. This time we sat down at the bar. It took the bartender 10 minutes to notice us before we were asked if we wanted a drink. 

Overall just disappointing experiences. My boyfriend is from Austin, TX and has now sworn off this AZ location. The Ahi Tuna burger is a good concept, but the wasabi aioli is way too powerful and ruins the burger. I had the turkey burger last time and that was good, but nothing amazing. I don't eat beef so I think I would only come back for the milkshakes. I can't say anything bad about those milkshakes!"}
{"text":"My hubby found this place on Yelp when he searched for \"Burgers and beer,\" our two favorite things.  When he looked on Hopdoddy's website and found out they were from Texas, he was really interested in trying it.  I remember seeing this place on South Congress in Austin before.  If it's on Soco, it's gotta be good.  

He ordered the Goodnight burger and I ordered the Llano Poblano burger.  We got a small side of fries, which really was only big enough for one person, so when we go back, we will be upgrading to the large to share.  The Llano Poblano has grilled poblano peppers, bacon, onion, tomato, and some sort of delectable sauce on it.  The Goodnight burger had fresh jalapeno and the best grilled onions my hubby had ever had.  

They have a great local beer list, including beers from Phx and Flagstaff.  If you are jonesing for an AZ craft brew, this is the spot to go.  Our only knock on this whole place though, were the huge goblets that the beer comes in.  Those goblets are better suited for margaritas or a drink you can drink with a straw.  They are a little cumbersome and unstable for good hard beer drinking.

Overall, there is no question that we will be back!  I'm already craving that Chipotle ketchup again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The turkey burger and veggie burger are amazing. So is the lamb and tuna!!! Little pricey but worth it. My new favorite is the thunderbird. Must have one!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with fantastic service and burgers. I had the Prime and it was very good. The fries are amazing and the shakes are good too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great burger joint. Got to had the prime time burger and truffle fries... great job Charlie and team. Keep up the  awesome job. We'll be back"}
{"text":"The system for ordering- you line up and go through cafeteria-style- is kinda weird, BUT you can circumvent that by sitting at the bar. 

We tried the classic burger and the \"Llano Poblano\" with the regular fries. The burgers are juicy and cooked right with good beef flavor. I was glad to see they are not asking $10+ for all of their burgers, just one of them.

The fries are pretty good and there's enough for two unless you're in a gluttonous mood.

The highlight of the meal was their $5 milkshake- the caramel sea salt. I'm asked weekly to go back for one."}
{"text":"We are considering another trip back to Scottsdale solely so we can eat at this place again. THE BEST BURGERS me and my husband have ever eaten. The bread is not too thick, meat is seasoned perfectly, good quality lettuce and tomato. Good portion size too. Fries were obviously cut and made fresh- very tasty. Also I had the Peach cobbler milk shake which has bits of crust in it. So delicious! Cant recommend this place enough. I hope they would consider opening a restaurant near where I live!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which Hopdoddy location I'm critiquing here , but assuming it's the one closest to me. Got delivery today through Door Dash. That part was good. I ordered a regular burger and truffle fries . Was hungry for a good burger and fries so it was a $30 splurge. Had to do a quick reheat on the fries. There were a lot of fries and only one teeny tiny half filled cup of sauce.
Then the burger... I took a bite and it was cold and pretty raw inside although the outside was charred. I mean raw and cold enough no juice..bloody or not.. was running out of it. So into the Nuwave goes the chunk of burger. Once I got it to a nice medium it was pretty juicy.
I think the toppings are pretty sparse for a burger that pricey, although the burger itself was a good size.
So, basically very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I'm the naysayer here. Their burgers are great, shakes excellent. Service is extremely erratic. During the past three visits they've lost a burger once and twice misplaced our drink order. Something is amiss between the people who come to your table as 'waiters', the kitchen and the bar. During the past three visits the waiter has not touched food or drink orders and tonight challenged me when I asked to speak to a manager, 16 min after he said he was going to get our drinks. I hate to do low star reviews but it's sorely needed if this place is going to excel. I also think it's a mistake to not pay at the counter. This is fast casual. Pay at the table is a very thinly veiled way to extract more tips when the waiters don't actually provide added value. The actual kitchen servers do great. Please get the house in order so I can come in for a burger and relax instead of cringing that another issue will happen."}
{"text":"These may be the best Burgers in Scottsdale. Great location, great atmosphere and the food is amazing.  Ordering is a little strange, but other than that a cool place to grab a bite. 

You order at the cash register and they pick your table for you when you walk in. The food and drink are then delivered to your table. Anything else you want to add to the tab can be ordered at the table also. I'm assuming they do this to speed up the ticket time. (I would rather they NOT, but I guess you shouldn't complain about food coming out Fast.) 

Bar area seems to be a great place to be, and the booths and table give you a great vantage point. No desserts here except for milk shakes so be ready for that. I had the Goodnight Burger, medium. Perfectly cooked, seasoned great and the bun was everything you need in a great Burger. (the sassy sauce is to die for also)

I would give this place 5 stars if the ordering was done like a regular spot, but 4 stars is for sure solid."}
{"text":"Great choice! This restaurant has it all. Amazing, mouth-watering burgers and yummy slightly seasoned fries. Plus, to-die-for milkshakes are a bonus! (Salted Carmel yum!) 
Service is good, not too many complaints there. Love the actual store itself as well; cool tables/booths and a nice bar. 
The only negative I can say is about the line for ordering food. Kind of a confusing line and annoying to stand next to people eating or servers passing-by. 
Great overall casual place to relax and eat!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty solid burgers, fries, and milkshakes. The food comes out pretty fast and tastes great. My favorite burger is the Diablo and favorite milkshake is the Nutella pretzel...sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, salad and drinks! I will return and bring more friends next time!! 
Truffle fries were extra special!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. Awesome beer selection. Awesome vibe. We loved this place and will definitely be back. Tried the El Diablo burger this time and can't wait to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Interesting setup, it's not your normal system when you go to a restaurant.
They assign you a table
You order at a checkout
Get your own drink then Sit
They bring your food

Choices of food is pretty simple. I ordered the impossible patty which is meatless, plant based, but taste and looks like real meat. 
Truffle fries are really good!

I'd come back if I was in the mood for a burger"}
{"text":"The goodnight burger is absolutely amazing along with all their shakes. They have fantastic service and is a great place for families or a casual date night."}
{"text":"Great if you want an undercooked Burger and food poisoning! They are really great at not reading ticket orders and not following order requests. The \"chefs\" do not know the difference between well done and raw meat which means they're open to hiring anyone to work in the kitchen (No culinary experience needed) & serving you up a nice undercooked burger. It seems mastering the technique of a well cooked burger is not in the cards for this establishment; after flipping so many burgers on a daily basis, they still fall short. I placed an order over the phone for pick up and specified that I wanted the burger to be \"medium Well\". I get home and end up biting into a practically raw burger. The cow might as well have been lying on the table saying \"moo\" it was so freaking raw! Completely unacceptable. I have a sensitive stomach. I was not feeling well. I asked for a well done burger for a freaking reason and now I have to deal with an onset of additional sickness / food poisoning because HopDoddy can't seem to get a simple order request Right! Not ok for being in the food industry. Set better expectations and a more promising experience for your paying / potential customers in order to survive & maintain business. Thanks for the E. Coli & for taking my money! Never again! Is there a way to give them 0 stars & my medical bill?!?!"}
{"text":"OBSESSED with this place. Whenever I am craving a burger I come here. The milkshakes are amazing too. I like the ordering system. It is easy and simple, makes for a quick good meal.

Buffalo Bill is definitely my favorite with the Nutella Pretzel milkshake :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are great. I love the Greek burger a lot. The beer is alway cold. The service is nice and it's always packed. The milkshake is out of this world. 

I do not enjoy the ordering system. I always feel rushed and never branch out from my usual. 

I'm only giving this place 3 stars since I'm from Chicago and can get an even better burger for an astoundingly cheaper price with a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is odd and not so good. Apparently, you are supposed to go inside and order, get your table, and then order any other stuff you want from your server. Multiple different servers came to our table. We asked for ketchup 3 times and it never came. It's a burger and fries place. Ketchup should be standard and on the table and if not, brought to the table upon request before your fries get cold."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned at first ad it seemed much too swanky for me. There was a huge lunch line, so this place was obviously fantastic. Everything has fancy catchy names and they don't serve regular soda. They offer their own versions made with real sugar instead of high fructose stuff. I am OK with regular industry soda, but it tasted like a mix between pepsi and RC cola. Worked great for me. Their frys were super fancy too with sprinkling of green stuff, some kind of herb. They were perfect and came out as an appetizer. This is perfect for me as I usually eat most of my fries before my burger. The hamburgers seemed small, but totally satisfied my appetite. The flavor was AMAZING, and worth the $35 price for 2."}
{"text":"We arrived to a line that was starting to wrap around the side of the building, however, it only took about 20 minutes from the line outside to the cash register inside. This was our first time here, and we debated whether the line was a hype thing, or a good food worth-the-wait thing. 

I ordered \"The Goodnight\" - Angus Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, Hickory BBQ Sauce, Caramelized Onions, Sliced Jalapenos, & Sassy Sauce (I decided to opt out on the jalapenos and sassy sauces)

He had the \"Terlingua\" - Angus Beef, Chile Con Carne, Corn Fritos, Tillamook Cheddar, Sassy Sauce

We shared the Parmesan Truffle Fries (holy cow - order these)

Gonna have to say that the line we encountered was most definitely a good food worth-the-wait thing!  The bun was amazing, the burger was cooked to a perfect medium, and everything was as ordered. 

Overall: A
We will be back - I want to give the shakes a go-round before ginving this a full on 5 star rating! Update to come!"}
{"text":"Consistently great burgers and an interesting menu, creative drink menu and good service from energetic young staff if you ask for it. Otherwise you stand in line to order at the counter. Crowded at happy hour and beyond. Delicious! A favorite!"}
{"text":"Normally go to the hopdoddy on camelback so it was my first time here! Please to say that I was equally satisfied in terms of service and quality of food. This is my most favorite burger place ever!! And I am a self-proclaimed burger enthusiast so saying it's my favorite speaks volumes. For the quality of food that you're getting, you also can't beat the prices. Good food, good beer, good milkshakes, good service. Hopdoddy is just great all around! If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I live just down the street so I've been here a few times since they've opened. Hubby and I love their happy hour! Excellent prices on beer and in terms of cold beer, they give twin peaks a run for their money there! Normally comes out with frosty foam on top because it is so nice and cold. Of course, the best part, their burgers. I've tried a few so far and they are all so good. Best turkey burger I've had and I normally am not the biggest fan of turkey burgers but thought I would try it out one day, not disappointed! I think it had goat cheese, and everything that was paired with it just gave it the best flavor. As for the regular beef patties, they are just so juicy and flavorful. I can't wait to try them all! Also, if you are just craving a milkshake, try them out here! Salted caramel is sooo bomb, and my husband loves red velvet, so he got the red velvet shake and he loved it! Totally worth the price. Only reason I didn't give the fifth star is because I think that their waiters still need some work. I've sat at the bar and at the regular tables, and I thought the bar had better service. Regular tables you have to catch someone walking by if you need something."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger really bad and so I searched on Yelp to find any burger places nearby. I am a big fan of the Hopdoddy on Camelback so I was excited there was one in Scottsdale that my husband can stop by and pick up an order for us on his way home. He was also excited that one was close by as well so I placed an order online to be picked up asap. 

The online ordering system was pretty easy and they require a credit card to complete the order. I decided to order the PrimeTime, Parmesan truffle fries, and the Nutella pretzel shake. When hubby came home with my order, I dug in and the burger was delicious and satisfying. The fries were a little salty but I still ate them and the shake was good. I only consumed half of it because I thought it had too much pretzel in it. Overall, I'm a fan and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yay, another burger joint in the area. I wanted to visit to see how this place stacks up to the others. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon lunch. Surprisingly, we weren't welcomed with a line. I had no idea what to do - no hostess? I think that's a cashier...

A menu was given to me from some employee... We walk to the counter and I order the Diablo bu rger and the Parmesan truffle fries. We don't pay, but are given two empty cups (for water) and a table #. So we look for our table # and we wait....

I thought we had to find water and serve ourselves, but finally some employee came by to fill water for us. Then, we get this waiter of some sort - he asks us if we are ok, our food will come soon, etc. We finally get the food and the burger was a little on the medium side, but packed with so much spice and flavor. The fries weren't bad and I enjoyed it too. This waiter comes by again and we ask for ketchup and aioli, we get that in little plastic cups (kinda tacky). 

When we were done, this waiter comes by again and drops our check off so we can pay. So yea, we assumed he was our waiter even though he didn't take our order and gave him a tip. Overall, the setup is a little confusing, but I really liked the food."}
{"text":"First time here, great burgers and fries. Husband had a chicken sandwich and he loved it, little spicy with the chipotle sauce but still good."}
{"text":"Cool little place to grab a burger. We came (party of two) during a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait when we arrived. Shortly after however, a relatively large line started to form.

The beer selection is really good for a burger joint and they offer healthy options with their fountain drinks.
They offer a variety of burgers, which all sounded delicious on the menu. When you first order, the cashier will warn you of the temperature in which the burgers come (med-rare to med). Unfortunately, our Buffalo Bill and El Diablo burgers came pretty well done. The saving grace of the meal? Fries. Nom. The freshly cut fries with truffle aioli were absolutely divine. They even offer a chipotle ketchup out of a dispenser that compliments the fries pretty well.

Decent experience overall and worth a try if you are craving a burger. Definitely get the fries - you will not regret it."}
{"text":"We tried the classic burger with bacon & cheese, overall they were good and I would order these again. The regular fries are good - large is a good size for 2 to 3 people. The other fries are a bit pricier. The soft drinks are fair trade which is nice but they're very bland which I'm not used to - they taste like water so I suggest just getting water. Seriously, $3 for a drink that tastes like water with sugar! The service is strange, you order at a counter and get your own drinks. They assign you a table and then bring you your food - we had like 5 different servers which makes tipping confusing."}
{"text":"The burgers are great. Hands down, the current burger and beer special for $10 is the best deal in town. The reason I gave 4 stars is that both mine and my husbands burger cook was overdone. Our son got a killer chocolate shake. Great dinner place for the family."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger spots in the west valley. I have tried the bison burger, tuna burger, and bacon cheese. You have to try the queso dips with your fries; I promise you won't be disappointed. I have never had bad food and the staff is always knowledgeable and fun to talk to. I like to sit at the bar for the full service experience. Since tables are fast casual. It can be a little expensive but I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fantastic gluten free grass fed burger. Messy-eat with a fork-deliciousness. Deserved 5+ stars."}
{"text":"We were just visiting in Arizona so decided to make this our last stop before heading home. Came in for lunch and it wasn't crowded. Right when you walk in you grab a menu and head to the front. The tables are all numbered so they bring you the food depending what table you pick. I loved the options of fountain drinks. 

The burgers came quickly and were a hit. Juicy and had lots of flavor. The fries were okay for me. Service was great the whole time. Our server checked on us many times and was helpful in getting refills even though we were able to get it ourselves.

If we had one of these closer to me I'd definitely go back more."}
{"text":"It's from Austin, so it already gets 1 extra star from me.  Sit at the bar if you want service, otherwise you order from the counter.  Now for the food.  The truffle fries are bomb.  We got the Buffalo burger and the jalapeno burger.  The jalapeno burger was excellent.  The Buffalo burger just didn't make sense.  It lacked cohesiveness.  There was Franks Hot sauce, bacon and blue cheese.  It all sounds great on paper, but once on the place, it really didn't do anything for us.  The beer selection is great and they serve the beer in a 19oz schooner for $5.50.  I hear it's $4 at HH.  WHAT?!!!  Craft beer at that price?  Please make your way out to SoCal!  My wife ended lunch with a salted caramel shake to go.  It was heaven!  We will be back when in AZ.  Come to SoCal.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Found a new favorite burger place! Won't bore you with explaining the ordering process, since everyone else has. My daughter and I shared the Primetime, the Goodnight and parmesan truffle fries. Both burgers were cooked as ordered - medium rare - and were flavorful and \"messy juicy\". The fries were to die for...she was even digging to the bottom of the paper cone to get all the goodness that had settled there! We also both had the cream soda...a great change from the usual soft drink offerings. Definitely putting Hopdoddy into our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Excellent buyers!  Service was very good.  The fries reminded me of mom's.  Size of burger was perfect."}
{"text":"We went here today hoping for a great burger and fries.  When we arrived, there was an employee moping the floor from a continuing leak from the ceiling.  That happens in the best of restaurants.  I was upset when the same person who was moping the floor brought our food to the table.  I hope he washed his hands.  The burgers and fries were very good.  I hope they washed their hands in the kitchen. I have gotten food poisoning before from restaurant food.  It was not fun.  Because of that I am always careful about restaurant cleanliness.  Just look at Chipottle."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes.
Burgers.  Beer.  Hormone and antibiotic free prime angus beef ground fresh daily, fresh-cut Kennebec fries, buns baked from scratch, local greens (when available) and 20 plus different breweries on tap.  It's a dream for burger inamoratos.

The burger choices are as varied as the beers on tap, such as the \"Greek\" with lamb, feta, cucumber, tzatziki and the \"Buffalo Bill\" with bison, bleu cheese, and Frank's hot sauce - but for a purist like myself I enjoyed the \"Classic\".  And what a flavorful, incredibly juicy burger this was.  The patty alone stood beautifully and proudly on its own, the secret Sassy Sauce gave it an extra kick of flavor alongside the fresh lettuce tomato and onion - but this meat being so full of flavor I could have enjoyed it by itself.

The deluge of deliciousness doesn't end there, though.  The parmesan truffle fries are outstanding, the truffle aoli alone should receive an award, there are lovely salads such as Baby Kale and Spinach Arugula, and you have to complete your meal with a hand-spun shake of either Stout Chocolate or Caramel Sea Salt.

This place just gets it right on all fronts, where food is concerned.  I have never been a fan of walk up counter service, but the food is delivered to the tables and servers are visiting all of the tables to check on guests, offer refills, bring additional items, and make sure that all customers are happy.  The process appears pretty smooth and streamlined, despite the issue caused by long lines of people waiting to order when there are not enough staff members present to take orders.

When I think of excellent burger spots, this is the first pace that comes to mind. Just for the gorgeous taste and juicy flavor of the meat."}
{"text":"Nice time great food was a little disappointed with my burger. They tired to make up for it. I'll try it again one day."}
{"text":"My new favorite burger place!! The pablano burger is awesome, and the truffle fries are amazing as well. The green chili queso is fantastic too. The employees are super friendly and helpful. Very cool atmosphere. I would recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"\"Best burger in the valley\" definitely describes this place! First of all, GREAT atmosphere! Such a cool interior and different idea. The service was spectacular. Our server had us laughing throughout the meal, brought drinks quickly, and provided great recommendations. The burgers were really REALLY good, and the garlic fries were amazing. I wish I had room for dessert because the shakes looked awesome. Get there early on a Friday night, the line is out the door by 6:30, but the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"The burgers are so tasty. All the food is fresh. Beer choices good to always an ice cold glass. They always have a specialty burger and shake."}
{"text":"Actually, an exceptionally good burger. The ratios are spot on, the flavor and texture of the grind is on point, the tomato and onion are fresh, and the housemade bun is the perfect combination of soft, and, well toasted.  Matt (I Think) the bartender provided great personable hospitality!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the impossible burger and I had a great experience. First, I need to give major compliments to the server Magdalena. We were enjoying our meal and minding our own business and then Out of left field she offered us complimentary ice tea and was super attentive! She would be a reason I would keep coming back to this location. Second, the impossible burger is legit. Truly tastes like a real hamburger. However in the future I would pick one of the other burgers and ask to substitute with the impossible patty to mix it up. Truffle par.esean fries are delicious and whatever sauce they give you for dipping you want to just bottle up and take home.

We will be back to come see you Magdalena!!! Your kindness and genuine care is something every server should aspire to have."}
{"text":"Expected more from the reviews.  Place was packed and staff was harried, not sure sufficiently staffed.  Food was good not great."}
{"text":"One of the best veggie burgers I have had. Love the seeded bun and the pesto. The fries are amazing as well, perfectly seasoned and cooked. The staff was very friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent! Great burgers, great options, hip ambiance. Flavors were good, and all the sauce (made from scratch) options were fun!

My only wish is the burgers were slightly bigger. I got the magic shroom burger with grilled onions and I highly recommend it! Next time I come around (I think there will be whenever I crave a decent burger), I'll be excited to try other burger options with an ice cold beer. And be sure to get fries for all the sauces too!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for a burger, so I decided to stop by. The set up is kinda weird the first time you go. I was greeted at the door by the hostess and asked if I would be eating in. When I said \"yes' I was immediately given a menu and directed to the counter to order.

Once you place the order, you are then directed to a table (they tell you where to sit). The server came over and let me know he'd be taking care of me.

i get my burger and it after the first bite it felt like a greasy tire. Grease was literally leaking out of the burger after I took a bite. The fries were below average.

The experience wasn't bad and the atmosphere was cool, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not your average burger joint, most definitely this sets the bar!  

From the effortlessly cool interior to the locally sourced ingredients, Hoppdoddy's is far above any of its competition. 

3 of us came for dinner, when you walk in you're directed to a counter to place your order, while you're waiting a waitress will come up to you and assign a table, then you can order drinks from the full bar that's to your right as you wait to place your food order. 

I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger, served perfectly rare, this sushi grade tuna is just careful seared to keep it in it's burger shape. Wonderful and delicious honey wasabi sauce mixed expertly with a hint of teriyaki and crunch of nori chips make this \"burger\" easily the best I've ever had. The soda section has all natural house made sodas with cane sugar and no corn syrup. 

For dessert I ordered the Stout Chocolate shake and it was even more impressive than the main course, sweet, rich and creamy. 

If you're looking for the best place to grab a gourmet burger, shake and even a drink, look no further!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe and energy in hop doddy. Food is quick. The way they seat you in a little strange but it works, you grab. Number and sit at assigned tables then they come find you - it was very confusing as to what we were supposed to do the first time we are here. The shakes are very rich and heavenly. Great healthier menu choices as well! Glad there's a hop doddy in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Everything from bison to chicken and classic beef!  The combinations are made that way for a reason; they're so good!

Get an order of the truffle fries, they're so good!  Make sure to dip them in the sauce, then use that to pick up the Parmesan pieces.

The sodas are by Maine Root.  Very mild and super delicious.  The Pink drink they have is prickly pear lemonade and it's mild but tart.  Professor Cane soda was the most awesome tasting rootbeer!  You just have to try everything!"}
{"text":"Great poblano burger and awesome beer selection!! Just went in for the $10 burger and beer deal and couldn't be happier with their service. 

Our server was super busy because of the deal and we had a delay in our fries, but he was very apologetic and made it right. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Who grinds up an ahi tuna burger or chicken, how about ground up prime rib burger? Talk about taking a good thing and totally ruining it. Same goes for the order at the counter concept. Why would I tip a server who literally does nothing? All the food even the salad is served on a metal tray. Ugh it is not a flattering presentation. When i cut into my burger I get pieces of paper along with it that they use to cover the tray. Why is that there? Are the trays unsanitary? The service is horrible because no one knows whats going on. Everything is confusing. I know I won't be eating there again. Save a few bucks and time by just going to smashburger. Counter order, specialty burgers, pick your own table, they bring your food, no tipping. Simple delicious priced right. It's really not that hard! Hopdoddy Epic Fail for overpriced food and bad service."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Scottsdale. Don't miss out and make sure you order the truffle fries with aioli  the service has been good every time I have been. Good atmosphere for evenings and the bar is good too. Don't be scared to try something new as some of the burgers are quite unique."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I want to come here every day. This place has the BEst buns I've ever tasted. Brioche bread perfectly golden toasted and buttered. I could just eat a dozen buns haha but the burger itself was amazing as well! Juicy and flavorful. But wait-- there's more.... Parmesan truffle fries. Get your own order. Don't share. They are so good. And the shakes!!!!! I mean this place is the whole package. Run don't walk!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best customer service I have ever come across let me start of by saying that Cesar is very customer oriented and really cares about his customers! They make you feel at home. Tatum has great customer service as well we will definitely be back not just because how amazing the food is but because of these two great workers!"}
{"text":"The general manager Cesar and our server Ryan were incredible with customer service! All the way to the woman who took our order, who reassured me that the Thunderbird was her favorite and even ordered it just the way I do. We were SO pleased with our time! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but the set up is a little strange. 

Let me also emphasize the food was amazing. 

However, upon arrival, you are greeted and ushered to an ordering station to place your order and pay for your food, and then are given a table number. When seated at your table you are then greeted by your 'server' who will be taking care of you from this point on. 

So after my wife and I finished our meal, we ordered dessert from our server, who then brought us a second check. 

It seemed strange for us to be paying for food twice in one sitting, but that is how it goes at Hopdoddy. 

Did I mention the food was amazing?"}
{"text":"Super flavorful burger! Fries were bomb. Overall good experience. Just know that it's a place where you order and get a number."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place when I was in Austin, but did not get the chance. My husband and I visited this restaurant at 2 pm on a Saturday, so it was busy but not packed. We each ordered a burger and a beer and shared an order of queso fries. For those who like queso fries the way they are made in Austin, I would not recommend this dish. The cheese sauce is served on the side of the fries. It was very good - just not exactly what I expected. The burgers were delicious - definitely the best in the area. I love the draft beer selection, as this is one of the only places in Arizona that serves a large variety of Arizona-brewed beers. Great place to try  a new bev and I will definitely be coming back. 

I'll admit, the ordering system is a bit confusing for Arizonans (you place your entire order and pay at the counter, then they bring out your food), but they do have servers for each table if you forget to order something or need another beverage. They offer self-service all-natural sodas (yay, sugar cane), so you definitely will never need to wait for a soft drink refill.

In all, two filling burgers, two local drafts and a large order of queso fries ran about $37. I've paid way more for food and drink of a lesser quality."}
{"text":"The food was good but the ordering and getting a table process was brutal. The hostess talked us into sitting outside as she said we have heaters. She said she had \"no \"clue\" about how long the wait would be for an inside table. We get outside and all 3 heaters were out of propane. We all ate as fast as we could because we were really cold. Not the greatest experience and won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the Diablo burger and it was okay. The size of the burger was decent and it the presentation was good. The reason I give it 2 stars is because the cost for what you get is not even close to worth it. The burgers are way overpriced and it doesn't even come with a side. The layout is odd as well. You order at the stand and then they bring the food to you. You get your own drinks and refills. I did tip after, but wasn't sure what I should be tipping for. If I go back it will just be for drinks."}
{"text":"We ordered a burger and fries to go. The burger was way undercooked (I'm 36 weeks pregnant so this is a big problem). I bit into pieces of ground up bone twice. The burger is way over seasoned and so salty. Fries were cold and stale. So bummed, we really enjoyed this place the first time we ate here a while back ."}
{"text":"The burgers!!!!! Man, they are delicious!!!!! And the Parmesan truffle fries are YUUUUUMMMMY!!!!! It is counter service, so do not walk up until you are ready to order."}
{"text":"Lunch in Scottsdale AZ! 

Came recommended by a long time Yelper and new friend from AZ this was the first on her long list of places to eat in Scottsdale... I'm sure the list was not in any particular order but I chose this place to meet a few friends. 

Simple ordering process goes like this... customer places their order at the counter, you find a table and a place to sit and the server brings you your order. You pay your bill to your server. I placed my order for a Buffalo Bill (bison, apple-smoked bacon, blue jack cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato in sassy sauce). Comes with hot sauce but I didn't want it in my burger so they placed it in a small container on the side. Everything was delicious! While I had the bison burger, the rest of our group tried the other specialty burgers: Magic Shroom, Llano Poblano, El Diablo, Primetime and Thunderbird. I also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries w/ Truffle Aioli... wow! mouth soir√©e! So delicious! For dessert, the manager (or owner) was kind enough to give us a sampling of their popular shakes including Nutella Chocolate Pretzel and the Pumpkin Cheesecake shake (seasonal).

They serve the freshest all-natural ingredients including their patties (no growth hormones and antibiotics)... so yummy and tender meat! The restaurant is quite big with a casual setting. There are both booths and tables available with outdoor patio seating on both sides of the restaurant. The staff is friendly and our server was awesome! Gosh! forgot his name but shout out to our server at Table #31.

TRIVIA: How Hopdoddy got its name: Hop for beer and doddy because it's the nickname of a tasty cow. Enjoy!

Review #0601"}
{"text":"Aside from the burgers tasting delicious af, I like hopdoddy because everything is local and organic(so they say). They have a long list of burger choices but I usually stick to the goodnight burger + bacon. I do wish the burgers were a bit more filling since they cost upwards of $9. I'm usually still hungry after the burger so I usually indulge in one of the milkshake specials. This is probably my favorite burger spot in the valley. Always a good choice!"}
{"text":"It's weird to give a restaurant 2 stars when the food is awesome.  I just wish their \"concept\" wasn't so annoying.  You stand in line, order, then sit down and wait for a food runner to bring you your food.  You never see your server, they expect to be tipped like they're actually serving and at the end of the day it's such a terrible way to run a restaurant that despite the awesome food I'll take a slightly lesser competitor that lets me sit down, relax and wait for my food.  

If your concept takes more than a sentence to explain, you're wasting everyone's time."}
{"text":"Yea, it's different. Seating was comfortable. My medium rare burger took forever so I finally asked the server hovering to check on it. He told me he sent it back because he thought it was undercooked. Finally came out medium well ( no pink at all). Was happy to eat it and leave instead of waiting  for a third burger. Fries needed the oil changed but, were edible. Self serve drink station was far from where we we seated, might wanna rethink that. Condiments only available in small thimble cups  and far as well.  

Overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Having tried their hamburgers in the past and been dissatisfied with the taste of the meat, went back about 2 years later, I have noticed a change in the hamburger.  It is much better now, and as a result, my family now loves this place.  The fries are among the best we have had.  But it is the Ahi Tuna burger that is absolutely to die for.  I tried it one time and am hooked now.  Of course they still have great sodas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down my Favorite Burger Place.

I got invited about a year ago to try this place out for the first time. Its quite a drive from where I live now...(Chandler). Its about a 30 minute drive each way, but its worth it! I tend to come to this location more than the Phx location...as customer service here kicks ass!

Lets start off with how you order. You wait in line and order your food at the register, pay for your food. Then you get a table number and they bring it out to you. Not a ton of places do this style of ordering...but my favorite restaurants tend to, which is interesting. Its good for business of course, but also good to keep everyone happy and not waiting 45 minutes to get your food!

The line does tend to me be long on the weekends of course, but its for good reason. The burgers are amazing. My favorite would easily be the 'Buffalo Bill' burger. Its Bison, and has franks hot sauce on it. They have great fries with good green chili queso that you can order. The beer is fantastic, and is always SUPER ice cold with the glasses that they serve them in. Milkshakes are also very good here (nutella is the way to go).

Customer service is good here. There tends to be alot of younger people working here. I've had once or two awkward moments, but other than that everyone is nice here at this location. I've been twice this week already, which comes out to 2 hours of driving for Hopdoddy lol. I pray that one day they open up one in the Chandler (Germann/Dobson) area :)

Customer service 4/5

I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great burgers..Great fries..Great Local craft beer selection..Great shakes..Great staff!..Jessica was an awesome server..She was very friendly and had great customer service!..Thanks for a enjoyable evening!..We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Is this a social experiment to see what clients will submit to?

Upon arrival you get the awful realization that instead of having a cool meal out, you have instead walked into an overpriced fast food style restaurant, minus the fast portion.  Yes, for the honor of paying $12+ for an ala carte burger, you stand in line....for a while.....and then are assigned a table where your order will later be dropped off.  The entire process is clumsy and anyone that comes here with coworkers, or on a date, or with a business associate, or with their family should be prepared for the very awkward process.   Unless you are lucky enough to get one of the sparse bar seats, there is no table service.   Granted, if you do get that rare bar seat, you will probably love the place.   Our bartender was great, the beers cold, and the burgers were adequate....but not tasty enough if you have to sit anywhere but at the bar.

The food was edible, but at this price point you have lots of other options that will give you a more satisfying dining experience.   I strongly recommend heading a few miles south on Scottsdale Road and going to Rehab Burger instead....the difference in quality, service, and atmosphere is well worth it."}
{"text":"Seems as though the Patty size has gone down over time, my burger did not stick out the sides of the bun,  Still cant get to used to the ASSigned Seating, Ordering Pointless waist of time. 

Recommendations for Owners: get some real Forks I'm paying 8-10$ a plate  these stamped things are at the point of Nasty.  Work on that Chili Recipe add beans, reduce Cumin add Cayanne,  this should be able to stand on it own. 
Add: Onion Rings.

Ahh well this is going to be a tough decision to go back here as it is. 

rehab has this place beat hands down."}
{"text":"Just driving by and checked out on yelp and it came up as a 4 star place. They have very interesting combinations for their burgers. Mine had Fritos, chili con carne, cheddar and a well done burger. Damn was it tasty!!!  They have a unique selection of drinks too. They have one of my favorites, vanilla creame soda!!!  :D   The wife had a classic burger with bacon and a vanilla bean shake. We shared a large order of fries. The only bad thing was I didn't know they had parsley so I had to pick it off. The atmosphere in here is up scale with the set up but it is a casual dining experience. I would recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and takeout last night. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. My wife, a burger aficionado, told me afterwards: \"I don't think I've had a better hamburger ever.\" Guess that means we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for when I want a flavorful, juicy burger. I ordered a Goodnight Good Cause burger and added mushrooms. The jalapenos were actually spicy, with just the right amount of sauce to not only prevent the bun from getting soggy, but also allow the other flavors to shine through. Man, just thinking about the burger is making me salivate! The highlight of the bruger were the mushrooms; I eat a lot of mushroom and these were damn good ones.

I had a side of the kennebec fries, which were crispy and delicious, and paired especially well with the chipotle ketchup. Next time I do want to try the parmesan truffle fries though! Or the green chile queso with fries. Or the chili con queso with fries...

Although my s/o didn't like the whole ordering at the counter and paying before getting table service (because you're tipping before you get the service, so you can't adjust accordingly), I thought it was generally more efficient. The only thing I would change if I came back is not getting the ginger lemonade because it was a little too gingery for my liking."}
{"text":"the food was great and the waiter was attentative. Love the primetime. Pretty busy place looks like I went he the only one that comes back."}
{"text":"Such a good burger and love the truffle fries!! All local beers are good but the doble fina margarita was horrible!! Go with the classic frozen margarita and a great burger w an Oreo Shake for dessert. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious burgers and fries.  Excellent service.  Awesome selection of beers.   We'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"It's all you could want in a burger joint. Being new, this place was hopping but there is plenty of seating so there was no waiting around. The staff was extremely nice and peppy, helping us every step (literally) of the way. 

You order at the window and can pick up a drink at the bar on the way. The beers come in frozen goblets big enough that you have to hold them with two hands--I was one happy girl. Try the watermelon ale like I did if you like a lighter beer, it hits the spot. 

The burger list is not extensive but they are crafted well, I ordered the primetime which has Brie cheese, truffle oil, and steak sauce--why not try something rich your first time around? My friend got the el diablo burger which was nice and spicy-- they have something for everyone's taste buds.  

I know this place will have a lot of success in the near future and as their shirts say \"we spank our patties and they like it\". Well I definitely approve of whatever they are doing!"}
{"text":"I love this plce, I got burger  and french fries,,, so good .. customer service are so friendly,,,, nice atmosphere.... you guys should order fries super good"}
{"text":"What's left to say that hasn't already been said?  I'll try. The setup really is so awkward. It's like they didn't want to do counter service but had no real interest in full service either- so they just muddled the two to all oblivion. 

Two employees (tried to) explain the process and we were still left confused and honestly a little frustrated before we even sat down. Order at the counter in the back middle of the place, walk backwards get your own drink and condiments, try hard to remember the table number you were told 8 minutes ago, sit down and wait. You're then repeatedly told that you're now receiving \"full service\" when you just did everything the same as if you were at let's say a Chipotle. I've served for 12 years and id still never leave 20%. I FRIGGIN DID EVERYTHING. 

The food was decent but for $30 I'll go to Smashburger and have a feast, not two (smallish, super dry, and overcooked) burgers and one side of fries with a forced gratuity."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick burger after seeing the reviews on Yelp!  I got the Buffalo Bill burger with the truffle fries.  I really enjoyed the burger but thought the fries could have been better.  I also wish they were listening when I asked for no onions, since I ended up with what seemed like a half of a whole onion in the burger.  Other than that, would probably visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm not a meat person but they have decent burgers here. My fav one is the good night burger, it was juicy and I love the jalape√±o in it. I love the sangrita drink, it was delicious and so refreshing."}
{"text":"I've been to Hopdoddy in Austin so I was thrilled to see that one opened in Phoenix! Unfortunately, this location has just entered my Yelp Hall of Shame for serving me one of the WORST meals I have ever had in my entire life. 

I love cheeseburgers. Like seriously LOVE them. I eat them all the time, from the highest of the high end to the lowest of the low. My burger here was absolutely disgusting. I ordered the regular ground beef burger but I swear my burger was so poorly cooked that it had the consistency and texture of my aunt's nasty meatloaf that everybody HATED eating at family potluck dinners. Even the damn dog wouldn't touch her meatloaf, and this burger reminded me of that. It was almost as if the patty had been previously frozen and microwaved or mixed with something -- I don't know, but it wasn't right and it was super gross. 

Even worse, I ordered my burger medium well and it came out practically raw in the middle. The photos don't make it look as raw as it was in the middle. I also paid to add on \"super crispy\" bacon, and it was flabby and sad and chewy and nasty. 

I spent the majority of my meal sitting there seething about how unhappy I was with my burger. Why didn't I complain? Well, first, nobody ever came over to ask how our meal was and second, the place was packed and I didn't want to wait in a long line just to complain. I don't like to complain either and I rarely do, but I had to write this review to save others a similar letdown. Avoid."}
{"text":"It's like you've died and gone to heaven. 

We usually get the bean burger, but one day we went and they were all out- I was semi-upset because I don't eat red meat. The waitress recommended the Impossible Burger to us, to prevent us from leaving. 

Bless.Her.Heart. 

 I fell in love. It's made of wheat, potato and who knows what else but it's delicious and I could eat one every single day. If you don't think about it while you eat, it takes exactly like a regular burger but BETTER!

We always pair our burgers with their Parm Truffle Fries and OMG those are the best fries! Always crispy, fresh, and always more than enough to stuff your face! 

The waitress also recommended a Sea Salt Carmel Shake, and to add Nutella and Pretzels. WOW the best shake I have ever had too! 

The staff is always really great at checking up on you, always very friendly, and always making you want to come back. I am def a customer for LIFE!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch. I used to live just around the corner and this would have been a regular haunt for me then! Tons of burger and drink options with a great patio area. It's one of those \"order at the counter\" places which I'm not a fan of but at least they brought the food out to us. The burger was thick and cooked nicely and the \"sassy sauce\" was tasty - not quite a thousand island sauce but it really complimented my burger. I also ordered their local cider selection on tap and it came in a giant frozen goblet and was a bit frozen itself. 
The counter said the burgers would have a slight pink middle instead of asking how we liked them but both ours were cooked totally through, which is fine with me. The side of fries was just meh - I'm not a fan of shoestring fries and the seasoning was a bit much. The burger would have been fine and plenty without them.
Overall, a decent place - but since I'm not local anymore, not sure if I'd go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"We had a great experience while dining at the bar. Excellent burger, extremely cold beer and the service staff was outstanding. If the prices seem  too high for some of you, then split a burger, they are large enough! I still understand why management is so headstrong on keeping their ridiculous ordering que line. No one wants to stand in line..."}
{"text":"Love this place! From all of the delicious burgers to the yummy fries and the cane sugar sweetened sodas. I discovered this restaurant when I was undergoing cancer treatment. I looked for a healthier option for burgers to enjoy with my family. This is the place!  They even have gluten free buns for my son that suffers from celiac. Thank you for the high quality at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of the stand in line, order, then sit system they had going on but that was instantly changed when I noticed the bar that you're able to order a beer from while you're in line. 

Their beer menu is great. If you're looking for domestic beers they don't have them. I highly recommend the IPA. They serve it to you in a giant goblet that is near freezing. Needless to say it was fantastic. 

The line moved quickly and we were able to order then sit. 

I ordered the El Diablo burger and subbed the onions for fresh jalape√±os. I also ordered a side of the Parmesan crumble fries. Both were amazing. Easily one of the spiciest burgers I have had. The jalape√±os and peppers were fresh as well as the beef. I would argue that you could go there and order fries alone and leave satisfied. 

Did I mention for a party of 6 the price was under $70? 

Can't beat cheap food/beer that is amazing! 

Highly recommend this place for anyone!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Austin we had multiple people tell us we had to try Hopdoddy, that it was the best restaurant in Austin. Well we didn't get there in Austin so we decided to try it in Scottsdale. After all the hype in Austin, maybe we had our hopes set too high.

As many other people have said, the set-up of half service, half serve yourself is a little confusing. But now that we know the system, it's not that bad I guess. And our server was very friendly so there's that.

My guy and I both ordered the basic burger - me with cheese, him with cheese and bacon. We also got a large order of fries to share. The food came out pretty quick, which was great considering they were pretty busy and we were very hungry. 

The fries were good but nothing all that special really. We tried the chipotle ketchup with them. Bad idea! Not a good combo at all. Maybe that is intended for one of their burgers? The burgers themselves were also good but nothing special. It wasn't bad but I've had better. I felt like it was a little short on both cheese and sauce. When I have to pay extra for cheese, I want cheese! I ended up adding mayo to the burger just to give it something. And maybe it's because his had onions, but my man's burger was a sloppy mess. With every bite the burger just poured onto his hands.

At the end we both walked away with the feeling that Hopdoddy was just okay. It's not that we wouldn't go back, it won't be a place we'll be rushing back to."}
{"text":"Fun place! - Our waitress's T-shirt said \"We spank our patties and they like it! \"
One of the drinks is called \"Lil' Prick\" which is a sassy prickly pear martini with tequila.

We had the Goodnight Angus Beef burger with grilled onion and the sauces on the side.  It was cooked just like we requested. The side of fries was very tasty.  All served on a metal tray. They have a variety of Angus beef burgers,  a Bison burger, a Lamb burger, Black Bean corn patty, sushi-grade Tuna, Turkey and Akaushi Beef with Brie Cheese and Aioli sauce.

The drink fountain promised healthier \"cane sugar\" drinks and even my diet coke tasted better than at other places.  They have organic kale, caesar,and spinach arugala salads   We will definitely be back to try the homemade custard ice cream shakes with tempting flavors like Caramel & sea salt, red velvet cake, nutella and chocolate pretzel. Two burgers, two drinks and a large fry about $26 for hormone and antibiotic free Angus beef. Buns are baked from scratch. 

Hopdoddy means beer (hop) and doddy is nickname given to native cows of Aberdeen. Did I mention they have lots of beer choices?"}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite burger place in town, but it's pretty close. My fianc√© loves this place and will not go to zips so this is a great compromise. It's not fast food but isn't a sit down and order type of place. I get the ahi tuna burger and it is fantastic. Rare ahi tuna, served on a delicious bun with a wasbi mayo. It really is different and very very good. They also have their own brand of soda, which is awesome because I'm a huge root beer fan. I highly recommend sitting at the bar, it's first come , first serve and is easier than waiting in line."}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband and I stopped in on a Saturday for lunch. I am so glad we did! This is a trendy, happening place. It is clean, and with ample huge windows, it makes for a bright atmosphere. There is ample indoor seating, and outdoor seating on their patio, if you prefer to dine alfresco. We were greeted with huge smiles as we entered, and since it was our first time in, the hostess took time to explain how things work. We looked over the menu, and found a table. The menu has a variety of different burgers made with organic angus beef, and topped with fresh ingredients. There is also a choice of ahi tuna burger, turkey burger, and even a vegetarian burger! There are sides, drinks, milkshakes, and salads. I chose the classic burger, they asked me if a ribbon of pink in the burger would be okay. I said yes. My burger was cooked perfectly, and was topped with a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, onion, and sassy sauce (don't worry it is not at all hot). I opted to have cheddar cheese added to my burger. The burger is served on a toasted bun, and was delicious!! My husband and I ordered some fries to share. We ordered the regular fries, and they were thin, crispy and not at all greasy! They have a wide variety of natural sodas. We were going to try a salted caramel Oreo shake, but after our burgers and fries, we were stuffed, so that will be something to try next time for sure!  
The d√©cor inside is modern, upscale funky. You can bet I will be back to Hopdoddy when I am in the area to try a different burger, and one of their signature milkshakes! 
Bravo for the great experience Hopdoddy!"}
{"text":"Tuesday 4:30 -no waiting in line. Everyone was super friendly and I received my food in a reasonable time. Truffle fries are wow yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by hopdoddy Burger Bar the other day tried their meatloaf Burger quality of the food was very very good but I definitely thought it was overpriced ! I'm sorry it's very difficult to use to paying $10 for a hamburger must be a millennial place"}
{"text":"I fell in love today and that lover's name is Hopdoddy. 

From the get-go, one will notice their unique concept of ordering your food in line, and then seating yourself. Self-service ice water w cone-shaped cups are effectively placed for folks waiting in line. Samples of frozen margarita are generously offered to patrons. One server looked at my leg brace and crutches and told me to take a seat and my food/drink will be ordered sitting!! That is creating a great customer experience in my book!!

The ambience is hep-cat and cool w tunes from B Marley, Fleetwood Mac, etc washing over you.

Staff has genuine smiles and fab attitudes. They seem to \"want\" to be there working.

Had a medium burger w cheese - so scrumptious! Truffle/parm fries were well-seasoned and served cone-style. Margarita was perfect blend!"}
{"text":"I am almost sure I have eaten at every Hopdoddy Location minus one in Austin. Oh yes I love me some Hopdoddy. 

Why you ask. 

Its all about that shake, shake, the one with caramel and sea salt. YUM!!!

Don't get me wrong the burger here are great as well. Actually I think anyone opening a burger joint should eat here 1st and see how it is done right. Well 95 percent right. My only complaint is the disconnect between the register and seating. Was her twice in two weeks and had the same issue both time. Once it was slammed(so it might have made since) and the other was just casual traffic. Don't really get the issue here. Okay on to the food. The only other thing that some might not like is the price here. Not a cheapo burger so be prepared to spend a little more in this joint. 

Burgers are top notch. I even tried the chicken burger this last time and it might be my new favorite. Always love the chipotle ketchup on the fries, or even the garlic aioli. Trust me when I say this don't leave with out trying the salted caramel milkshake. As for as I am concerned best milk shake ever."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries, shakes are all amazing. Truly great food.  My big complaint is the service set up.  Pick something the counter ordering then being waited on is really awkward."}
{"text":"Good burgers! The classic is delish and the El Diablo is super spicy! I highly recommend the fries with green chile queso. So yummy! As for the milkshakes, I've only tried 2 so far: Nutella with chocolate covered pretzels is amazeballs and the caramel with sea salt just tasted like a vanilla shake with caramel in it. Meh. 
I really like that they offer different types of sodas than you're used to seeing, all made with real sugar. Even the ketchup is made with real sugar! 
Next time, I'm going for the Llano Poblano burger with roasted poblanos, pepper jack, and chipotle mayo and the Oreo shake! Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best burger places I  been, awesome local Beers. The El Diablo burger rules, beware super hot! You'll $&@$ fire and save matches!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love- vegan - gluten free options and ALL delusion. We go here mayne once a week and never have had bad service or any problems with our food. The green chili queso and garlic fries are to see for (on cheat day lol) yummy- you won't regret coming here and you'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Wednesday night date night. It was both my boyfriend and I's first time here so we wandered in and were immediately confused. We stood around waiting for a hostess, and apparently there are no hostesses here. So we asked the bartender if we just seat ourselves or how it works. Instead of explaining that you order at the counter, she told us to just seat ourselves. So we did, so after waiting for a hostess that did not exist, we now were waiting for someone to take our order, which was apparently also not the way things were done. Also, we apparently fill up our own waters, which we were unaware about for the first half of our meal as we sat there with empty glasses. Waiting, waiting, waiting. While, half of me feels like I have no right to complain about the service due to the fact that we approached the restaurant all wrong, half of me feels obligated that there was no signs or explanation on what to do. For someone's first time it can be confusing since this is not how a typical sit down restaurant is run. 

On to the food, I ordered the \"Terlingua\" burger, my boyfriend ordered a classic burger, we split an order of small fries, and we split a shake for a total of just over $30.00. The meat was tender and the fries were well seasoned. I would have preferred that my burger be a little warmer than room-temperature just so the cheese was actually melted. Overall, it was an OK experience, but I can find a better burger with better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has great food! The burgers are great and for what you are getting the price is good. Best burger I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I did not like the ordering/serving system they had.  Most critical job of wait staff to me is to explain the menu, get the orders correctly, put the orders in correctly.  They do none of that. They only bring out food & condiments, don't even refill your fountain drinks. How much do you tip for such an incomplete service? Food was good but nothing special.  We probably won't be back, there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Brought me and some girlfriends here for lunch . Service is good . But the set up is annoying and confusing and the food is not great for price! Zinburger way better!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite burger joint in the entire valley, however yesterday I found out their  milkshakes are no longer made using real ice cream. Instead they use \"custard\" and removed the best, Vanilla Bean milkshake from the menu."}
{"text":"There's so much of this place I don't understand, I'll just start at the beginning. 

First, the name.  What's up with the name?  I know 50's slang, and \"doddy\" is one I've NEVER heard.  Could be, but I don't think so. I thought they just made it up.  I've heard, \"daddy\" and \"daddy-o\", but never \"doddy\".  Server didn't know, either.  So they've go that going for them.

Oh wait. On the menu, it turns out It's the name of someone's pet cow. SWEAR TO GOD. So now, I'm eating the pet cow?!?!!

Which is hardly a good name for a restaurant. And a stupid stretch. What's really funny is, the server, an employee of this restaurant did not know. But what's Who thought this through originally?

Second, I hate it when you enter a restaurant and they ask you if you've been there before. Because why?  Why would it matter?  Loyalty points?  Not here.  It's not as bad as loudly asking a single diner, \"jUST ONE?\"  But it's close.

Well, here they ask you that because, even though they do have servers, you STILL have to go to the counter to order.  The server then will bring you your order.  Why \"half-a-server\"?  Doesn't improve service, doesn't do anything, near as I can tell.  And it's confusing.  And the server still wants to be tipped like a whole server.  Half-strange.  Somebody with too much time thought that one up and believe me, it's not going to catch on.

Third, the food.  The burger was bland.  Very bland.  Dry, too.  Not juicy at all.  Beef is too lean. Look, \"juicy is greasy, greasy is juicy\", and this was neither.  In spades.  VERY BLAND.  And not well-seasoned either.  More an effort to eat than enjoyable.

But worse and odder stil(!) was the onion.  My \"classic\" burger was lettuce. tomato, onion, I added bacon and cheese and \"sassy sauce\" on the side.  When the burger arrived, the onion was perfectly spilling out of the side of the burger.  Except it wasn't.  

It wasn't a slice of onion at all: it was a SINGLE RING of and onion, (truth be told, it was 3/4 of a ring of the onion),  placed along the outside of the burger.  Which would have been great if we were TAKING PHOTOS of the burger, but this burger was to EAT!  I don't get it.  I believe that onion as a topping on the burger, in this country, means a SLICE OF ONION.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And unlike the name of the establishment or the 1/2 style of service they offer, a single onion ring isn't choice or cute.  It's amateurish, unprofessional, cheap or all the above.

Oh, wait: it's Instagram!  \"We'll design a burger MADE TO PHOTOGRAPHED!  Taste-schmaste!!  Just make it look good!  But what i wanted is flavor. Just flavor. 

I even commented to the snooty waiter, before the Instagram connection had been made in my head, \"this would all be perfect, the onion spilling out, would be perfect IF WE WERE PHOTOGRAPHING IT!  BUT I CAME HERE TO EAT IT!\"  I was ahead of myself, I just didn't know it. 

The truffle fries were good, not great, NOT a huge portion and $7/copy, if I were coming back, I'd forgo the fries.  Too pricey.

And that's the point.  I'm not getting the fries on my next visit because there will be no next visit, I'm NOT coming back.  Half a restaurant.  Half a flavor.  Half the service.  Less than half an onion.  Twice the price.

The list, my list:
* Lucky Boy
* Harvey's Wineburger (16th St only)
* Zin Burger
* Freddy's Steakburgers
* Last on the List: HopDoddy"}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGERS AND FRIES EVER! Everthing I have tried from here is amazing. The 4 stars would be a 5 if I didn't have to stand in line (outside) to wait for a table, then stand in line to order cafeteria style at the bar AND again for food, then have a server get me a soda refill and leave me feeling like I am supposed to leave a tip. If this place offered a comfertable place to sit while waiting and table service it would be a 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"I had a lot of hype on this one. I have done several drop offs and pickups while Uber Driving so I was pretty excited to check this place out. Now when I have amazing food I judge all the same type of food to this high standard. The only bad thing is it disappoints you more often! 

I ordered the cheese burger with bacon comes with all the usual toppings and a fresh baked bun about $8. The burger was tasty better than most restaurants. Was it amazing? No! We also ordered the truffle fries very tasty with chipotle ketchup. My daughter ordered the stout chocolate shake (no alcohol) very good shake. My wife ordered the turkey burger she liked it very much.

The atmosphere is nice and modern with a bar. Basically you get a table and order at the back counter and a server will bring your food...works well.

1)burger good

2)truffle fries amazing

3)atmosphere excellent"}
{"text":"Went back with wife and friends. I had the Japanese beef burger with Brie and caramelized onions. Outstanding! Wife had the poblano burger and loved it . Friends said best burger they've ever had . Shared the salted carmel milkshake for dessert . Outstanding service. Couldn't have had a better casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Take it from a fatty this is good stuff.   Burger was incredible.  Fresh ground meat, made on site buns and fries.  Great meals."}
{"text":"I love how they only use local and humanely raised meats. Everything I have had was delicious as well. I  have had their black bean burger, their turkey burger and their classic burger. All I would get again. Also, cocktails are great!"}
{"text":"Well, how many 5 stars have I given to restaurants? Not many. I am very capricious about my 5th star. It takes A LOT for me to wield that 5th star. 
I like Hopdoddy's A LOT! Lets face it, this isnt the place to eat 7 or even 5 nights a week. Its too expensive for that and really, its a treat. The burgers are delicious and the milkshakes are amazing! I dont even want to think about how many calories are in those puppies! 
Anyway, lets get back to the beginning. 
The location is easy to get to off Shea, the parking lot is decent, shared with Chipotle. You walk up and there is free lemon water right at the door so you can help yourself when you are stuck in line. The concept is a hostess gives you a table number while you wait in line to order. You order at the register but pay at the table with your waiter. Then they bring you your food. Maybe they want you to order more food/drinks at your table? No idea. The menu is pretty simple; burgers, fries, drinks. I did notice they do have a couple salad choices. I've never ordered one so I cant speak to that. Since stepping foot in this place the only thing I've ordered is the ahi burger. Omg. Heaven! Its a piece of ahi tuna seared on both sides & red in the middle with yummy stuff in between the buns! The other meat burgers look pretty tasty & juicy as well but I've not tried one of those either. The fries are very flavorful with several options for dipping. They are slim not fat fries but still satisfying. They have a full bar with clearly posted specials for wells & beers. But Ive not tried any of those either. I have the Nutella pretzel milkshake. To DIE for!! Dont bother to get one when you're on a diet. This shake is very rich, creamy, satisfying and tasty! Be wearing your fat pants here girls!! Lets just be honest. The place is very chill with a couple tv screens playing whatever sporting event is on. They have a happy hour from 3:30-6 and the service is very attentive. They have high tables and booths. They use highchairs that hang off the end of the table for the little ones. My kids are 9,7,5 and my little one sits better at a booth than sitting in the tall chairs. The bathroom is usually reasonably clean and we've used it alot. The sodas are all non-GMO so I feel a little better about letting my kids indulge. Once in a while anyway. 
So, even tho the prices are def on the higher side for burgers, I feel it is well worth the value for an occasional treat. Others might say its expensive but good things can be. Dont say i didnt warn you about the milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for someplace different for a burger experience.  Friends had recommended this location - and sure enough, when I walked in, we were greeted by friends at the bar!   They gave me the down-low.  If you sit at the bar, you get full service.  If you don't sit at the bar, you have to stand in line, order your food at the counter, then get a table, where they take your drink order.  So you have to pay two different bills - weird.   My husband is not a fan of ordering at a counter (too much pressure while others wait for you to review the menu).  So we opted for the bar - which was a great choice. 

First - the serving team was fun and helpful.  They talked us into their daily milk shake  - pumpkin pie.  Yes, a whole piece of pie went into that puppy.  Awesome.  My friends said I had to try the Magic Shroom burger.  It was delicious!!!  The wheat bun was fresh made.  Hubby ordered the Greek lamb burger and an order of the Parmesan Truffle fries.  We let them know that he has a standard for the crispiness of fries (in a fun way!) and they delivered!  

Although we felt the Greek burger was okay, we both LOVED the beef/mushroom burger with yummy goat cheese. Yes - we ate it all.  And to top it all, they offer a discount for veterans. 

This is definitely a place we want to return to - sooo many more burgers to try."}
{"text":"Great fries to go along with their burgers. I\"ve been trying a few burgers off their menu, and so far they have been delicious!! Will be going back soon..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place and I drive in from the West Valley. Line is fast, service is amazing. I've gotten free refills on fries as well as cokes. Hamburgers are Soooo great. Perfectly made to order (I like a really rare burger and I get what I want here.) They are deliciously sloppy to eat, but that's part of the fun. Atmosphere is lively and young (I'm old, but feel comfortable.) You've got to try this place. Outstanding. Took one star off for travel."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are a big crowd.  No accommodations for you to sit together.  Very chaotic environment.  Food was good.  If you don't mind loud, chaotic eating, not so bad. But, honestly, there are others that are just as tasty and don't have the downsides."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always come back for the Magic Shroom burger, with caramelized onions instead of raw ($1 extra) and the Truffle Fries, which are big enough to share and served with truffle aioli for even more truffle flavor. What a flavor party for your mouth!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great place to enjoy a delicious burger & beer!  

I have driven by & wondered if the food is any good at what appeared to be a nice looking gastropub..., only after a very bad experience at a zero-star gourmet burger competitor, did we happen to try Hopdoddy & WOW! Exceeded our expectations so much we told our friends & encouraged them to come a few days later with all the kids.

Although every restaurant has its up & down days, H'doddy was short staffed & wasn't the WOW we had the prior visit (which is why this review is not a 5-star).

All in all, great place... with some interesting surprises like the different choice of fountain drinks, but for example, the charcoal-filtered water (or infused water) is delicious & our kids preferred water over the fountain drinks & that's not a bad thing (except for sales) for the family.

Definitely Hopdoddy will remain a family & friends favorite to our family.

Thank you Hopdoddy!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while now. And honestly it was pretty satisfying!

I do feel like the process of ordering your food as you walk in, standing up with your menus and not at your assigned table is kinda weird... I mean if you're going to end up with a waiter (needing to leave a tip) in the end I mean, might as well just have them sit us from the beginning and have them serve our drinks etc. 
that was a huge curve ball, did not see that one coming.

Otherwise, the staff were rather friendly. Everything looked nice and clean. The restrooms were also very nice and clean. 

The food did not take long at all to come out! It was very tasty, I was actually surprised at how delicious it was and couldn't understand how lol since it took such short time to come out. 
We will definitely be back for more some other time."}
{"text":"So I have read the reviews... today was my first visit. Nothing less than Kobe for me and i thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff was very sweet, helpful and went above and beyond when I mentioned I wanted to avoid ALL sugar. Good service | Good food | Good atmosphere  it's a keeper."}
{"text":"I felt strongly enough about my experience here to actually write a review. I work nearby and my co-workers and myself decided to come here for a Friday happy hour. Some of us arrived at 3:30pm and grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited for others to arrive. Including us there were less than 10 customers in the whole place. When more people arrived we wanted to move to a table. The employee we talked too was not accommodating and was very disrespectful. She said we had order first and pointed to where we would line up to order food. We told her that we were gonna have drinks first and get food later, it was only 3:30. She insisted we couldn't get seated at a table until we ordered. She then said we couldn't be seated until our whole party was present. I then mentioned that maybe we should go across the street to Macayos and we could get a table there! To which the employee said, \" you certainly can but their burgers aren't as good.\" We all had full drinks and finally got a table and decided to stay. We still had to go to the bar to order drinks, where I was charged $1 FOR THE ICE in my drink!!!!

The food was good but nothing special and didn't come with a side. The entire service model is inefficient and breeds poor customer service. At one time I counted 8 employees standing by the back counter talking for an extensive period of time while there was maybe 12 customers in the place and we could have used a server to get us some drinks. I was more appalled later when the place was packed and a line waiting outside and there were 3 male employees outside just chatting with the \"burger bouncer\" while there is a line of customers that I'm sure could be served or assisted in some way. 

My expectations of my employees in the service industry is much higher, I wish I could remember the name of the female employee that was so disrespectful and unprofessional. If you like even half-assed service don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever been to in terms of service. . Line out the door and they won't open another register. After waiting in line for 10 min. Sitting for 30 min. They forgot my order. There employees never thought to ask the guy sitting by himself if it was his. After all that got my money back. No food. Wasn't offered anything not even the food. They honestly didn't care. The manager supposedly told the one waitress to ask me to which her reply was well I knew her wasn't number 22. Mind you when I gave the cashier my number I also showed it to her so there wouldn't be confusion. 

I've been to the camelback location many times. Never seen a manager who simply didn't care about such a big mistake. 

Don't go!!"}
{"text":"I really wish this place would get their stuff together. Once again everything has changed. No longer is there a menu behind the cashier. Because that was too easy for people? 
As other reviews have complained, ordered my food, was told to sit at table 23. Proceed to table 23 and find a family sitting there.  Get back in line and explain. They tell me to go to 21. Go to 21. Watch my beer being delivered to family at table 23. 

WHY DO YOU MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT?? 

Other complaints:  the beers come in a giant heavy margarita glass that literally weighs 5 pounds when full.

You pay up front and they have a tip jar. So do I tip the guy who pushed 4 buttons and the people who deliver my food? Do I just tip at the table? The receipt has the 15%,18%,20% breakdown, but I don't really have a server so I don't feel like I need to tip that much.


The burger was good though. So you got that going for you."}
{"text":"Well, I am not sure what to think about HopDoddy.. 

I am giving 3 stars because the burgers as well as the cocktails were really good! I had the ahi tuna burger and it was truly fantastic, right amount of flavors!

However, I am still confused about the concept of HopDoddy. You get in and you're not sure what you're supposed to do.. Sit somewhere, wait, go at the bar.. I didn't see any signs that tells you where to go. After a few seconds, we were greeted by the bartender that told us that we were supposed to order at the counter ? 
So I guess you stand in line, choose your burger, order at the counter and then they assign you a table with a server? That's a weird concept.. You have to get your water at the soda machine. 

Why do we even have a server then? I'm quite confused. We did all the work already.. So it's between a fast-food and a restaurant.

Plus, there were so many servers walking around. I am not sure why they need that many servers.. It seemed useless.

Anyway, we will be back, however this time we will sit at the actual bar so we can get a full and real service! The burgers were really good!"}
{"text":"Only getting stars because of the food... Service was terrible. I hate leaving bad reviews but this feels necessary. Went in on a Wednesday night, food came out quickly. And food was delicious. Asked twice for water and it never happened. Are our burgers without a drink. Also asked for extra aioli which we never got. Didn't even know who was taking care of us because no one introduced themselves to us. Once I pulled out my phone to start writing my Yelp review this guy comes running around the corner with waters after we had our plates cleared? Disappointed that I left a tip over 20% previously to eating. Had I known service was horrible wouldn't have tipped so well."}
{"text":"Getting burgers and beers can get a bit pricey for this gourmet burger joint, but the food is downright delicious. They have a surprisingly impressive selection of local craft beers including Phoenix Ale and Fourpeaks. Also they serve them in ridiculous-sized margarita glass-like glasses. I got the Terlingua Burger that was amazing! Angus beef with chili & fritos! So personally I find this place perfect for a slightly elevated weekend lunch date lol."}
{"text":"The food is probably good but we won't ever know as we left before ordering due to the strange ordering set-up. You have to stand in line and order your food before you can sit down. End result = food with no available table. As you can imagine, this ordering system doesn't work well with kids so I'm going to call this restaurant 'not kid-friendly'. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I love hopdoddy,

went here a bunch when it first opened and tried almost all the burgers.

Definitely don't have any qualms about any burgers.

Be smart if you are unsure about something just ask for it on the side so you can control the amount you have. Definitely do this for the wasabi honey sauce on the ahi burger.


I highly recommend this place. The truffles fries aren't that amazing to get, try one of the others instead."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Hopdoddy for a while now, but never seemed to have the time. When I finally did, and after some good words by a fellow Yelper, I found myself driving there pronto. I arrived with my husband in tow around 7:30pm on a Tuesday evening. I had heard how a line will form outside, but we were lucky and there wasn't a line or a long wait. An employee (hostess?) opened the door for us and we asked about making a to-go order. She told us to sit at the bar, as that would be faster than waiting in line. Luckily, there was open space at the bar and we sidled up to look at the menu. The bartender was extremely nice, helpful, and friendly. He was very accommodating when we told him we had a to-go order. 

We ordered The Classic and the Llano Poblano with a side of parmesan fries. The shake of the day was Tiramisu and sounded yummy, so we ordered one of those as well. Our shake was ready before our food, so we tucked in with two large straws. Mmm, it was really thick and creamy. I really enjoyed the espresso flavor but the crumbled up lady fingers were a little on the crunchy side. By the time we finished our shake, our food was ready and we were on our way.

We took the burgers home and dug in. The hamburger was extremely tender and perfectly cooked at medium. I really enjoyed how flavorful it was and can't wait to go back and try the mushroom burger. The parmesan fries, which the bartender raved about, where meh. The fries themselves were good, but the addition of parmesan and the side of special parmesan sauce wasn't worth $6.50. (The regular fries were $2.75! Definitely a better deal.) The burgers were relatively inexpensive as well, around $7-9 (depending on extras/add-ons). 

Overall, I am very impressed and think I have found a new favorite burger place. I have been craving Hopdoddy all week and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"ALMOST perfect...

While I usually post reviews based primarily on the quality of service (or lack thereof), i'm going to base this review primarily on the quality of the FOOD. Reviews on food joints like this can be a challenge since we all have different taste buds and what one person finds delicious might be what another person finds average at best. With that being said, I think I have a pretty good palate at this point in life & i'm definitely a food-lover to say the least who can tell when the slightest thing is off when it comes to something I order. 

To date, I have visited Hopdoddy at least 4 times (several times during the day, once in the evening). I ate onsite during the first visit & ordered to go during the other two visits. While I have yet to try ALL of the burgers &/or menu items, I can safely say that the FRESHNESS/quality of the burger & associated ingredients (lettuce/tomatoes/etc) at Hopdoddy is UNMATCHED. I have always been a fan of FRESHNESS when it comes to food. I don't like stuff to taste stale/frozen/reconstituted/etc especially when i'm spending a nice chunk of change on what i'm eating. Hopdoddy isn't exactly cheap, but when I know that i'm getting my money's worth when it comes to the CONSISTENT freshness/quality, i'm ok with spending a little extra every now & then. As stated, I visited this place several different times at the time of this review, & each time the FRESHNESS/quality was spot on. The way they season the burger is beyond my understanding because the patty is just bursting with plenty of flavor (unlike burgers you may get elsewhere, where you have to dunk it in all this ketchup/etc just to excite your tastebuds). In my opinion, any time you can visit a place several times & the food is always spot on, you've got a winner. The milkshakes are also delish, albeit slightly different from the norm (they make all of them with like this cinnamon-based custard, so any flavor shake you order has a noticeable hint of cinnamon): Thankfully I like cinnamon, but this might throw someone else off (as it did with my mother who gave me hers lol). 

MY ONLY COMPLAINTS:

1. It has been a while since my last visit (currently on a special diet), so maybe this has changed since then: If so, please disregard this first complaint, but I wish this location had the option to call ahead & order &/or order online (or via an app). At the website, it states that online ordering is available in \"select cities\". Why Phoenix (the 6th largest city in the United States of America) is not considered one of these \"select cities\" is beyond my understanding. Aside from my very first visit, all of my visits were TO GO orders where I would come in from the gym (EXTREMELY hungry) and order. I realize that this is not a fast food place, but truth be told I hate coming in & having to sit at the bar (or a table) while I wait for them to cook my food. Maybe it's a ploy to squeeze a bit more money out of the customer for the bartender/etc but if I wanted to spend extra on tips/etc I would be eating onsite instead of ordering to go. Just my 2 cents. 

2. Selection on the fountain drinks is limited. While tasty, most are carbonated & for someone like myself who has kept a good 15lbs of weight off just by eliminating carbonated drinks from their diet, it's frustrating to be forced into filling up with a carbonated drink unless i'm just in the mood for lemonade, tea or water (which are your only non-carbonated/non-alcoholic options at Hopdoddy).

3. When done RIGHT, the fries are also delicious... But during my last few visits, the fries were overcooked/burnt which completely ruins it for me. It's seriously happened like 3 times in a row & I don't know if it's a new chef or what, but I absolutely hate hard/crunchy/burnt fries. On my last visit, I actually drove back up there & requested to have my fries replaced & to my dismay the replacement fries were just as bad: On my next visit, I will definitely be inspecting the fries before I leave, & if they're not right i'll be requesting a refund for that portion of my bill.

4. OK, OK... I said this review would be about the food, but lastly I must say that some of the servers are quite rude. In short, I came in once for a to-go order & after patiently waiting then paying for my meal (in cash) the server walked off with my money & took it upon himself to assume that I didn't want my change. When I requested my change (which I had to request from another server because my server disappeared once he got my money), the server eventually returned & had quite an attitude over the fact that I actually wanted my change back. He was snobby, unprofessional & rude, but I won't let one bad apple (the type of \"apple\" that is quite typical in this area) spoil the entire basket here: I just thought I would mention it.

So yea, Hopdoddy is my favorite burger spot in town right now, followed by Shake Shack & The Stand (although Shake Shack may become #1 very soon)! Check em all out!"}
{"text":"Great casual and reasonable place to grab a burger.  For those who complain about waiting in line to order, they do offer table service.   Ordered the truffle fries....awesome.  We also had the Buffalo Bill and the Shroom burger which were both tasty!!! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy has a great atmosphere and wonderful service!! Kristin was very welcoming. She greeted us as soon as we walked in and invited us to sit at the full service bar instead of waiting in the long line. They have a dog friendly patio. I'm not a fan of how the sell each item separately, no meal options. The food was good but not the best burger I've had. The parmesan fries were delicious but only come in a large and is $7."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! Had the thunderbird with meat and green queso sauce, good stuff."}
{"text":"While I've visited the Camelback Hopdoddy location a dozen times in the last few years, this was my first experience at their Scottsdale spot. My girlfriend and I went on Veteran's Day, which was a total madhouse - especially in comparison to the Veteran's Day we visited the previous year at Camelback. I'm not entirely sure if it was so packed because of the Veteran's Day deal, or if people in Scottsdale just really, really like trendy burger bars. I'd imagine it's a combination of both.

The line was incredibly long, which I later learned was only worsened by the fact that they make you pay for your food at the counter. At Camelback, you only order at the counter. When you're finished, one of the \"severs\" gives you a bill - which is a far more efficient approach, in my opinion.

Anyway, I've always like Hopdoddy, even if I maintain my stance that they look like they're following a checklist of what it takes to appeal to the millennial crowd - right down to the slogans laced with sexual innuendos. 

If you only eat fast food burgers, these things will blow your mind. However, if you've familiar with the whole upscale burger-bar trend that's a bit oversaturated in Phoenix, you'll find that Hopdoddy actually even holds its own quite well against those. 

Every burger I've tried is consistent and has never left me disappointed. I'm a big fan of their Diablo, Buffalo Bill (sans the blue cheese), and just a straight-up classic with a fried egg modification. But really, it's all about personal preference. Are they the best? Not by a long shot. But for a multi-state operated chain, you can do much, much worse than Hopdoddy.

Their fries are just standard. They're good, but not particularly great. I once compared their garlic fries to what you'd get at Smashburger, which isn't really saying all that much. Nevertheless, they're still edible. I suggest if you're dining as a pair, just order a large and split them.

The shakes are all fine, but a bit uninspiring in terms of creations. I mean, it's not like you can't obtain similar quality shakes with the same ingredients at a dozen other places around here.

Despite my criticisms, I do feel that Hopdoddy does consistently deliver in terms of their burgers. And for that, I give them a strong recommendation - even though I prefer the setup and \"vibe\" at Camelback just a bit more."}
{"text":"Why anyone in their right mind looked at this neighborhood and said, \"You know what we need? Another burger place!\" is beyond me. \"Premium\" burger bars have been rapidly growing in popularity this last decade to the point where I've found that the food, vibe, and slightly inflated prices all kind of blend in together. It's very difficult to tell one apart from the other, especially since they all seem to be located within a five mile radius.  

In some ways, Hopdoddy seems to be following a checklist of what is required to run a modern restaurant that appeals to millennials. It's been proven many times that people are willing to pay higher prices for their food - just so long as they know where it's coming from. Throw in some slightly obscure sodas, a bar, some Sriracha sauce, and slogans laced with sexual innuendos, and you pretty much have your demographic covered!

I'm not a big fan of their ordering system. We were about to go inside, until I was told to \"step back\" and wait in line by some kind of bouncer-type dude. It was very weird. When we were granted permission to go inside, we were able to sample their Nutella and chocolate pretzel shake. As another reviewer noted, if there's actual Nutella inside it, we sure as hell couldn't taste it. I quickly changed my mind about ordering it as a dessert.

You order your food at the counter, they assign you a table (and a server), but you're still required to go fill your drink, grab your sauces, and stock your essentials. You also have to cut through the line in order to do this, which is probably the result of a poorly designed setup. I have no problem with \"do it yourself\" places, but I'm not sure why they still expect a tip when you've done most of the work yourself.   

However, I'll give credit where credit is due. Hopdoddy actually has very good burgers! My girlfriend and I were both impressed with the quality of the beef on our classics. But, at the same time, it's not as if this was something I haven't experienced many times before. After all, it's not as if good burgers are scarce in Phoenix.

If you're familiar with the Smashfries at Smashburger, you'll get a pretty good idea of what their fries taste like. The green chili queso is embarrassingly overpriced, as it's essentially just broccoli and cheese soup similar to what McDonalds occasionally sells. It's not worth the cost, in my opinion.

For dessert, my girlfriend and I split a chocolate stout with Oreo. I'd compare it to a weakened horchata that's more milky than chocolately. We weren't really impressed.

Overall, I'd still give them a decent rating, because their burgers were excellent. But at the same time, there are so many places around here that serve burgers that are of equal quality, that I feel this place is only further over-saturating a neighborhood that has far too many identical establishments.

We'll probably return at some point, as I'm interested in trying some of their other offerings. If you like burgers, I'm sure it'll hit the spot. Just don't expect to get anything that you can't find by going to the fifty other places that offer a duplicate concept."}
{"text":"The burgers vary greatly but they're so delicious.  I never would have thought I would like a mushroom burger.  And no way am I gonna like a chicken burger.   
Well I was proven wrong.  The mushroom burger was my absolute favorite followed closely by the Ahi burger and the Continental (chicken).  The beef hamburger didnt seem nearly as appealing to my palate as the mushroom or Ahi tuna burgers.
French fries with a truffle aoli will give you a new found appreciation (truth here -it could be love) for French fries.   
Salads are delicious, fresh, combinations of the season.   The taste of summer watermelon in a salad of baby kale.  Fantastic.
Sodas from Maine that are made with pure can sugar and natural favors instead of a lot of dyes and chemicals.  Kinda makes you feel like a kid again.  BTW, i hear the blueberry soda ( yeah, bet you've never heard of that before) actually tasted like real blueberries.  
And then there are some special cocktails and deliciously tempting shakes that are unique to this place too.  
And the service is impressive.  The staff is knowledgeable of the menu items including the ingredients of each.  
Food is delicious and different.  Service is polite, knowledgeable,  and efficient.
AND prices are comparable to places like Fuddruckers.
I'm already planning to bring my family here."}
{"text":"Gluten friendly! They make their own gluten free buns as well as gf fries! The burgers are top notch. Killer flavor combinations. We tried the Parmesan truffle fries which were decadent and a caramel sea salt milkshake which I am still dreaming about. The set up is efficient and the staff friendly and very helpful. Do yourself a favor and try this fantastic burger bar!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here with very high expectations. I was told some of the best burgers and shakes and I had to get there Nutella milkshake. 

First off I love the building and the style of joint but ordering was a bit weird because they didn't have the full menu on the wall and the guy that took our order was a bit rude. So I get the Nutella shake and co worker got the red velvet. Neither of us were highly impressed with the shakes. They were good but not great.  

I get the turkey burger which lived up to the hype and my friend got the chicken burger which was 5 star quality. In the end I say skip the heavy shakes and just go for the burgers and great fries."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Bill is one of the best burgers I have had. From the first bite I could not set the burger down. Service was amazing as well too."}
{"text":"We went for the $5 happy hour which is $5 weekly burger, $5 drinks, and $5 fries. Loved my burger, so juicy and flavorful. I got the weekly one which was arugula, bacon, and apricots. Truffle fries were delish but next time I think I'll just go regular fries, the Parmesan gets to be too much after you eat like a pound of fries. Love the nice casual fun vibe of the place and the employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of me and my husband's go-to places if we are feeling a burger. The happy hour is great, $5 drinks, a special $5 burger. The service has always been great as well, very friendly and quick. We usually share a large fry. Burgers and fries are both so fresh and delicious. Environment is nice, upscale and even though it's an interesting fast casual model (you don't have a waitress but people will stop by your table to make sure everything is good) the place feels like a nice, modern place for dinner."}
{"text":"After seeing this place for a year in our neighborhood, we decided to try it with some friends. Our experience wasn't that great, though may have just been an off night for the place.

It was about 7 pm and the place was really busy, however only one person was taking orders, so it took quite some time. Once we ordered our truffle fries and milkshakes arrived within a few minutes. The fries were great, the milkshakes were average at best.

Our four burgers arrived, and of the four, two had to be sent back. One was missing bacon, which apparently was due to the kitchen being out of bacon but we weren't informed ahead of time and charged for it. The bison burger was sent back due to being undercooked but the kitchen also ran out of bison by then so a hamburger was subbed. Both times the staff was helpful and brought extra fries, but it was disappointing nonetheless.

The burgers weren't great and the price point was fairly high given the average quality. 

Unfortunately, there are better burger places nearby I would opt for over Hop Doddy."}
{"text":"Creative burger and drink menu. My shroom burger was tasty, goat cheese made the burger so good. Kids liked their burgers, fries and shakes. Well priced for the quality.  Vegan, bison, ahi, black bean, SO many burger options with tasty toppings. Get here alittle early as line to order can be long and move slowly. Solid burger bar. LOUD music."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. Always consistent. Today I tried an item that's new in az but on the CA permanent menu. The K-town belly burger. Regular grass fed beef patty, egg bun,pork belly, kamichi, Korean crisp rice, a sweet pork belly glaze and more Korean goodness, even some spice to balance it all out! Limited time unless it gains traction so give it a try. Tell 'em Ike sent ya!"}
{"text":"The ordering/seating concept is different, but you get used to it. It is a little confusing and frustrating to have multiple bills from various sections of the restaurant, but it always seems to run seemlessly. 

The burgers are really delicious. I have since gone vegetarian and have their black bean patty instead. It's good, but not the best I've had. It does have beets in the patty, so it is more on the purple side, which is interesting. I do, however, miss being a meat eater everytime I go here. The fries are delicious and I love their chipotle ketchup. I've heard from my gluten free friends that they have the best gluten free bun. 

I tend to go during lunch or early dinner hours because this place does get packed for dinner. I went one Saturday night and did the waiting in line thing. If you have the time and patience for that, then go for it. I usually have plans after dinner and don't want to chance being late."}
{"text":"I took 4 students with me to this location and we all had an amazing time. It was super fun to order and I loved that the restaurant was so inviting to everyone. My students loved the drink choices and atmosphere as well. I had a wonderful cheeseburger-can't wait to go back, very hip!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I WILL return, but actually didn't quite care for my burger too much. I tried the el diablo and actually found it quite chewy, so much so, that I had to spit out pieces after turning it into gum. Gross. Maybe just an off burger patty hopefully... I'd like to give them another shot. 

Regardless, fries were pretty good though WAY over priced. Shakes are incredible here, actually worth the high price. 

Cool atmosphere, awesome soda selection, nice beer selection. Open views with TVs in all the corners."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 7 and had a table pretty quickly. When you walk in, they ask how many are in your party so that they can arrange the table. After that, the hostess will point you straight ahead to the cashier who will take your order. The menu is a different story and for being as simple as it is, the choice was difficult. 
I ended up with the classic burger with bacon and cheese, then added a fried egg. Wow. I'm a huge burger fan and this place nailed it. All of the sides were great rather it was regular or Parmesan fries...delicious! I recommend this place to any burger lover. Did I mention the beer?! All the locals....four peaks, San tan, some others....beer was ice cold out of the tap! Try it, love it, repeat!"}
{"text":"In Arizona for a family trip. Met up with friends living here who selected Hopdoddy. The food is high quality. I had the mushroom burger, regular and sweet potato fries. I think my burger was bison. It was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I've found in Phoenix. The ingredients are all fresh and it was reasonably priced. Even the cocktails were fresh squeezed and our bartender was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Incredible! I had no idea this place was so awesome. Looking from the outside I always assumed (you know what they say about assuming) that this place looked something like a \"Sweet Tomatoes\" or 5-guys inside. 

BUT ALAS it was a fine establishment, something I imagine seeing featured as a \"best I ever ate\" on Food Network. Beautiful, classy decor with a darker wood-pub feel, great island bar and INCREDIBLE menu. So freakin happy about this place... Picture a meal you would get at a 60's diner (burger, fries, milkshake) and then infuse upscale, trendy ingredients and presentation, and lots of truffle oil. BOOM. Hopdoddy. Love this place. 

Now if I can just figure out how to eat here without gaining 70 lbs."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe here.  Order from the counter, and then they bring your order, and quickly!  We noticed that there was provision for a long line and ice water outside, as well as a notice that tables were reserved for those in the line, so we imagined that it could be crowded, but not at 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon!  We both tried local brews, which we later learned were not included in the Hoppy Hour prices, but that was okay.  Served in an icy footed goblet, my wife tried the San Tan Epicenter and I wanted to taste the Phoenix Ale Watermelon, which neither of us felt had a fruity taste, so it was fine too.  My wife went for the Llano Poblano Burger, which she pronounced a winner and muy delicioso, and I was attracted to the Goodnight Burger because $1 of the price went to a local charity--plus it had fresh jalapenos on it!  Both were outstanding and almost too juicy!  We shared a large order of truffle Kennebec fries, and they were so good by themselves that we didn't use the accompanying sauce because they were perfect as is.  A really cute place, service was great, and next time I want to try one of their renowned milk shakes (like raspeberry white chocolate cheesecake or Nutella!)  We will be here again next year!  Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is freaking amazing! I love how you can choose your burger, they even have options for those veggies! Every combination is unique and proves to be mouth-watering delicious. 

It's a more modern set up, you go to the counter and order, are given a seat, and then someone delivers your burgers to you. The decor gives you that \"we're fresh from the farm but very modern\" kind of vibe. A great place for aesthetic pictures. 

Their seasoned fries are to die for! It's a large portion, so I'd only get them if it was 3+ in the party. Everything you buy there is basically al a carte (they charge extra for cheese on the burger). Overall I love the vibes of this place. They have gourmet and affordable burgers, amazing fries, shakes, and drinks all in one place."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy's is just a restaurant full of YES!

Want a variety of burgers that are cooked to perfection? Yes!
Want bomb fries and good sauce to dip then in? Yes!
Want a a variety of drink options (aka from beer to boozed up shakes) to whet the palate?  H-to-the-Yes!

Hopdoddy's has the fast casual, yet cool burger bar 100% down.  The way it works is simple: you order at the counter, they give you a table, and then all of the deliciousness is brought to you.  It's not pretentious, it's just solid good service and freaking good burgers.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite burger place in Scottsdale! My family and I go there every Friday night. Sometimes a little bit of a wait but it's completely worth it!"}
{"text":"Super cool happy hour spot ($5 specials) with an amazing burger! Love all the condiments they offer with your meal. I especially love the chipolte aioli with my fries."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and shakes are amazing! Love this place.  The lamb burger is my fave along with the chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Great place. Not too crowded at lunch!  Custom list of Burgers, unique soda fountain, i noticed that they have large bar w/ nice selections. The 3 types of fries are great and they have a few really good superfood salad selections. About $15/ person. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"The five star is for their great customer service.. we had lunch here yesterday, had the turkey club, the chicken burger and a classic. The club and chicken were tasty but the classic seemed a little blah. The fries however was perfection! I also ordered Lumberyard Hef which was served on a frozen glass, that was probably one of the most refreshing beers I've had since moving to AZ. 

But now the review on the customer service... hours after we've had lunch, my son wanted to try their milkshake so we went back after shopping. Unfortunately my son forgot the shopping bags we had with us. I called a few hours later to see if anyone had come across it and thankfully the employees kept it safe for us. *high five* we will definitely be back! Especially for the beer"}
{"text":"Very busy noonish lunch hour . You wait in pretty long line to order. Modern decor , big booths , large center bar w service. Ordered a very spicy  el Diablo burger and a plant based Impossible burger both served on a great roll/buttered? Bun . Sides of dipping sauce . Huge bowl of chili fries w a spicy dipping sauce. Nice hospitality station out front for people & pets with water ,cups, dog bowls , & mini dog treat bones! ( phoenix in June not many dogs shopping at noon )"}
{"text":"My friend from Dallas has been raving about this place for quite some time so we decided to check out their new AZ location on my lunch break. From the moment you walk in, you can tell this place is more of a restaurant than a fast food joint. Servers bring the food to you and you pay at the end of your meal, as you would in a restaurant, but you order in the beginning in a line (then they assign you/your party a table). It's an interesting concept that's for sure.

Anyways on to the burger. I ordered the Terlingua which included chili, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and the best part -- Fritos! I'm a huge fan of Taco Bell's Beefy Crunch Burrito so I knew I'd be a fan of crunchy Fritos inside a juicy burger. Just as I expected, the combo was a hit! I also tried some of my friends fries which were pretty good although I've had better elsewhere. I will definitely have to try the truffle fries and one of their amazing looking milkshakes on my next visit there (when I'm not planning on going for a run in the afternoon lol)."}
{"text":"I had the grass fed burger with bacon & avocado on a gluten free bun with a small fries.  It was $20! The burger was good and the flavor of the bun was good but fell apart so I needed to eat it with a fork & knife instead of picking it up.  I love that I can get food of this quality - but at that price I would expect table service rather than walking up to a counter to order, getting a number, sitting down & having someone drop the food.  The staff asked if it was good & was really friendly.  I would definitely go back since I love the quality and would be be prepared next time - but was a bit shocked my first time.  :-)"}
{"text":"After meeting with our FA, we stopped here for a late lunch. I had a Ahi Burger, my wife had a Veggie Burger and our FA had the Plabano Chicken Burger. All our burgers were delicious, nice flavors with fresh ingredients.
The Ahi Burger had all the components of an Ahi sushi roll, bits of seaweed, wasabi and the ahi was seared a little too much, but still had the raw tuna in the middle of the patty.
The Kennebec fries, which I asked the cashier what were they and he replied just a fancy word for french fries. But I did some research and that is the name of the potato which has less moisture than the average potato and is best used for chips or fries. I couldn't stop eating them.
I had their Stout Chocolate shake to go which was placed in a 16 oz cup. Nothing special with the taste of the shake."}
{"text":"I love lamb.  I love beef.  This place has both and they do them both right.  

I opted for the lamb burger and wasn't disappointed.  the burger had cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, and a great tzatziki sauce.  My friend had a regular cheeseburger of some sort and it was just as spectacular.  The burgers are absolutely enormous, so be forewarned.

We split the truffle parmesean fries and they were crispy, decadent, and fresh.  

As we sat and ate and drank we noticed some monsterous milkshakes being taken to tables and we were very jealous.  However due to the size of the portions, we were very very full.   Next time I will not only split the fries, but split a burger so that I can then split a shake!

The logistics here can be a little confusing. You walk UP to a counter and place your order. They then tell you a table number to go sit at and your drinks are there waiting.  (beer is served on tap or via bottles as well as fancy soda).  After you sit at your table you are then introduced to you server.  They then bring your food to you and serve any other tiems you may order. Weird, but it works.  

Nice low key/casual place for a great burger."}
{"text":"Brought my mom and it was great as usual. We made it for happy hour. $5 truffle Mac n cheese burger. $5 sweet potato fries with a chipotle aioli and $5 drinks great happy hour prices. The burger normally would be $13. Every time I go I get a different burger and it never disappoints. This time it was a patty of truffle Mac n cheese either fried or grilled they added caramelized onions and arugula it was so good the combination just made me do the happy dance."}
{"text":"Wow- I got an order for takeout, drove 20 minutes home, and it still was amazing! Great experience start to finish. Placed an order online at 7 pm on a Friday, it was ready 15 minutes later as it quoted, and the bartender was a nice guy who was friendly and prompt even though they were really busy. The burger and fries I got were ridiculously good but the whole menu looked good. It was my first experience and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Hands down best food I've ever had. I had the veggie burger which was packed with flavor and great texture and the truffle fries which were the most incredible fries. The service was outstanding and the whole place was extremely clean. Highly recommend going for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I thought the ordering and service were clumsy. The burgers and fries weren't bad but I didn't taste anything that would make me rush back. 
A nice collection of beverages there, from the eclectic fountain drinks to the beer selection, you won't be disappointed. 
Staff was friendly and polite. 
Grass fed and Gluten free options were the reason we came and they were satisfying."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Scottsdale for the price, which go great with the delicious and refreshing cocktails and craft beer!  I love that they have goat cheese as an option, as that's my favorite kind of cheese.  For a starter I recommend their parmesan truffle fries, covered in cheese and served with a side of truffle aioli."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, Arizona- They spank their patties and the patties like it.... This is according to the shirts worn by some of the staff. After having had one of the patties I'm guessing the seasoning is what is spanked into them. We had la bandita black bean burgers. Phenomenal. The best I've ever had. I'd eat the corn studded red-colored patty solo and enjoy it but if you really want an overload on amazingly paired flavors just order it as listed on the menu and you'll get bursts of slightly bitter arugula, refreshing cilantro, a bold chipotle mayo, creamy avocado, and a jolt of goat cheese. The truffle fries and margs were super accompaniments. Haylee, our waitress, was delightful. Her upbeat spirit and outgoing personality provided an uplifting and energetic dining experience. She is knowledgeable of the menu, made fantastic recommendations, and went the extra mile to make sure our party had the best experience. Our party of four all rate Haylee and the food highly. Spot on."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers and craft beer. Server was nice and good vibes for not so expensive but great meal!"}
{"text":"I have visited Hoppdoddy here in Phoenix and Scottsdale a few times and now feel I can fairly review the experience. 

I rate it as inconsistent. 

I would rate the food way above average when it is prepared the way the customer wants it. But preparation has been inconsistent. They seem to have a desire to cook burgers rarer than i want so be careful if you prefer burgers without pink centers. 
Their shakes can be amazing, my wife and I love the Chocolate Stout and the Salted Caramel, but having ordered the same shake a few times, the recipe has always been executed differently. 

Truffle fries have always been awesome. Regular fries good but not worth the price. 

I agree that the service is a bit strange. But not so that it affected my visit very much. The confusion about leaving a tip or not didn't bother me. The only service we got was someone bringing us our food. They do that at Carls Jr. So...No tip from me. 

I have eaten at and managed hundreds of burger places and my Hoppdoddy experience has ranked in the top 15% and it has ranked in the top 35%. When it is good I think it is really good. When it is not at its best it is still better food than you get at most places, but because it is so expensive expectations are very high."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now. And always the service and good are good. The burgers and ingredients  are great quality."}
{"text":"Why anyone would give this place anything less than a 5 star rating is beyond me. Not only is the food sooo delicious and nutritious, the people who work here are quite gracious and pleasant. I have been to this establishment several times and every time it blows me away. Everyone I bring here is amazed as well.
BTW, Haley is the bartender with the mostest! Such a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place! The chicken burgers are so fresh and not over spiced up. I like it with the arugula and beet salad. 
The kids menu is great as well. The mini cheeseburger and fries are a great size for a hungry kid.
Also LOVE the shakes! Cannot go wrong with the oreo milkshake!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  Try the Nutella Shake . Burger was really good. I recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"Had amazing service at the bar by Glory ..  excellent burgers and sweet potato fries. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Remember about a little over a decade ago when you first tried Chipotle, and it was a little bizarre to order your burrito like a Subway sandwich? But it was so simple and since it was fast-food, you quickly got over it once you took a bite of that monstrously delicious burrito, and Chipotle quickly became just another quick service restaurant in your fast-food rolodex. Hopdoody takes a similar approach to reinventing the way people dine, but instead of enjoying the experience, I became overwhelmed and frustrated.

Hopdoddy is a gourmet burger bar. But it has a system that seems to work fine with moving its line along, but that goes opposite to what diners have grown to expect. My wife and I (and our baby) were meeting friends at the restaurant, and wanted sit ahead of them and give her a bottle before everyone arrived. We knew the place was pretty popular and called ahead asking if there was a wait. We were told the line was just a few minutes. Little did we know, that meant that the line to order food (which apparently you must do to get a table) was just a few minutes. So if we wanted a table that meant we'd have to order our food and probably get it before our friends even arrived. Either that, or we had to wait and watch the line grow while we waited for our friends. Lucky for us, they arrived just a few minutes after we did.

My next question for Hopdoddy is who the hell do I tip? You wait in line to order food. The bartender will serve you a beer as you pass the bar waiting to order food. There is a cashier that the register where you order food. There is a separate tab for each order. Oh, and there is a waiter working the table. So I guess if I order something from him, I tip him. If he just runs and buses the table for me, he gets screwed. Seriously, I must be too inept to dine here.

Oh, and after all that. I really wasn't overly impressed with my burger or fries. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything great."}
{"text":"The burgers are OUTSTANDING...you haven't lived untill you try the parmesan truffle fries...the caesar salad was unusual but delicious...one minus....we were there before it got crowded and the restaurant was NOT cool enough...other than that a great experience."}
{"text":"Truffle fries are great! Hamburgers were better when Hopdaddys first opened, but they are still worth trying. Recommend the prime hamburguer and the buffalo."}
{"text":"This place is on point! Amazing burgers. Awesome beer. Great vibe. Waited a while, but that is to be expected for good food and cold drinks on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great burger for the price. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and efficient. The vibe is warm and inviting. Great location with plenty of parking. I've been 6 times already and will go back of course."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Their gluten free buns are AMAZING!! The buns are similar to corn bread and.... basically fucking delicious."}
{"text":"visited for the impossible burger, which we had tried in NYC at umami originally. burger was great! def. recommend to anyone. 

service was a bit strange.

asked the cashier if the impossible could be made pink inside, because i read some restaurants have been overcooking them (well done) & since the novelty is that it \"bleeds\" and browns like meat (starts pink). he said it's not real meat, so it can only be cooked one temperature like chicken, but when it came out it was indeed pink inside (and some outside, lol). hmmm. 

we were warned there was a \"burger backup\" so that we would get our fries before our burger. no problem! sitting outside + the wait meant they were cold before we got the burgers, but the staff replaced them when we asked so no big deal. a subsequent employee came by to check on us after and apologise for the delay, or maybe just to make small talk, and we basically had five different staff interactions throughout the night from start to finish. 

terrance (sorry if i'm speling his name wrong) was super cool and nice and easy to talk to--very invested in making sure we were having a good time. he's a keeper, hop doddy. hold on to him. 

overall: 
impossible burger: 6/5 (haha) ($14)
la bandita: 2/5 ($9)
general employee interactions: confusing/5, but generally positive
terrance: 5/5"}
{"text":"We love Hopdoddy, mainly because they have such an amazing happy hour! It includes a $5 burger, $5 fries, $5 drinks, etc. Hubby and I can get a meal and drinks for $25 out the door! Their burgers are great and their shakes are AMAZING too! Also love that their beer mugs are frozen so you get that layer of freeze on top of your beer :) Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We loved the environment and quality of the food.  Our service from Elizabeth was amazing compared to our last visit where the server took our food while we were still eating and telling her we were not done. Never saw anything like it! She was so preoccupied with something on her mind, it was almost comical, but it was our food and were not done eating. We are glad that we came back as Elizabeth was on top of of her game.

We had the Buffalo Burger an Mushroom Burger no chesese and hats off too the chef as you can see from the pictures they were cooked perfectly. Make sure also too order the fried as they are so yummy!

We look forward too our next visit and hope we get Elizabeth as our server."}
{"text":"What a rad joint! Love the look and appeal of everything at this place from the design elements all the way down to the chipotle katchup mmmm hmmm delicious. I got the buffalo bill burger with fries and an icy cold schooner of beer. Everything that came out with our order looked amazing and delicious   Staff was rad and everything about this place was unique and different."}
{"text":"We were greeted by an incredibly rude cashier who made us want to leave the restaurant. However the GM (Cesar) and FOH manager(didn't catch name) were extremely kind and understanding, insisting that we stay. The food was delicious-- the salad one of my favorite ever! The meal was comped and the service went above and beyond to correct the error. Will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the classic cheeseburger, it was tiny! I'm not a huge eater but I was still hungry afterwards. The burger itself lacked flavor and to be honest I would have preferred In and Out. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but if you can't get the basics right you need to improve your game. Truffle fries were tasty and service was really friendly."}
{"text":"Fries came out super fast, BUT they were cold.  Old stale fries....no thanks.
The burger that we ordered \"medium\" hit the table and it was raw.  It looked as if the party had been seared or flash fried......no thanks.
On to the chicken sandwich.  I was confused by the texture at first, I was expecting a chicken breast.  It was a chicken patty.  There were several different colors going on in this chicken patty.  There was white, pink, tan, brown, dark brown, specks of black.....no thanks.
$40 later and a bunch of no thanks.
No thank you, I don't like your food.  I will go spend my money at a place that serves fresh fries, burgers cooked the way I order them, and that offers a chicken sandwich NOT a chicken parts patty sandwich."}
{"text":"It's a good burger. Came here on a whim after the gf said she was a fan of the franchise in LA.

I got the llano poblano burger, I liked it and I'd be cool ordering it again.
Haven't tried anything other than the burger so far.

I'd say it's in the realm of competition with fuddruckers but they make it hip in comparison."}
{"text":"I'll start off by going out on a limb and saying that this place has the best burger I have ever had ! EVERYONE MUST TRY THIS PLACE! 

Honestly it's delicious, and the place is so great because they have all types of burgers, ranging from the most simple to the most elaborate. I'm a classic burger kind of gal, so if you're classy too and go with the classic burger you won't be disappointed. Be mindful of the sassy sauce because it is definitely a hit or miss depending on your taste buds, it can't hurt to get it on the side! In addition, they have PICKLES!! Not one type of pickle either.. we got two types to choose from ladies and gents and they are tasty. If you take walks on the wild side, any of the other burgers you go with are made to perfection, it really just comes down to how mature your pallet is because they have some crazy options here that won't let you down. 

Lets talk about the meat. The fact that the cows are humanely raised, antibiotic free AND the meat is ground fresh, in house, every day. It's really good for you and they don't make it crazy expensive because of it. Lets be honest, all pretentious jokes aside, the meat really does taste better and you will never get one of those gross gritty bites that meat has sometimes. 

THE FRENCH FRIES!!! both types are killer, you must try both at some point when you are extra hungry.

THE BEER!! so many options, and you get it in this glass gauntlet that makes you feel like you're in Beowulf, in the mead hall celebrating a victory. 

THE FOUNTAIN DRINKS! they are all so different and diverse, if you stand there for a few minutes and try them all they don't get mad at you- BONUS

GLUTEN FREE BUN! it's amazing and it tastes like a biscuit. It is also messy as ever but your eating a burger anyways.

For the people that don't like this place because its not traditional, don't be so boring!! The atmosphere is really cool, and they set it up differently then anywhere else I've been to. Go in, let them show you the ropes, and when you order something extra at the table and they bring you a separate check for the extra items ordered, don't be mad!! Did you think it would be free? Blasphemy! Long line on a Friday night? YOU MUST WAIT IN IT! Totally worth it. Last but not least, the staff is friendly and you can tell they all love working at such an awesome place!"}
{"text":"I came to Hopdoddy about 3 years ago and though I do remember loving it, I never made it back in until this past weekend. It was my brother's birthday on Saturday and he insisted we come here! Now, you know a place is special when the vegan of the family chooses to go to a burger bar on their birthday. He of course ordered the black bean burger and fries. As usual, he loved it. So much so that he came back the next day for another one!  

Since I'm not a huge burger person, I usually go for a turkey burger at places like this. I can confidently say, this is one of the best (if not THE best) turkey burgers I have ever had! It was topped with pesto, provolone, arugula, tomato, onion, and bacon. I only have one word... WOW. It was so fresh and exactly what I was hoping for. Next time I'm here and feelin' adventurous I'll go for one of their crafty burgers and a shake.

I should also mention that the staff was so awesome and patient with me and my family! I'm glad I was finally able to make it in again so that I could discover the valley's BEST turkey burger and also to remind myself how great this place is! See ya very soon, Hopdoddy!"}
{"text":"I've dined here for over a year now, and I don't know why I haven't written a review yet!

I gave up sitting at the booths- I don't like lining up to order.  I just saddle up to the bar and get quick service there.  Aside from creating my own burger, I can only order one of their twelve crafted burgers without having to omit key ingredients.  All of the rest either have sauces that contain cornstarch, or corn syrup (sassy and steak sauces), too hot to even consider (El Diablo), or have items I am allergic to.  Yes, I can ask for them to omit these items, but then all that is left is the burger patty and bread!  So it's the Llano Poblano for me. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hopdoddy-burger-bar-scottsdale?select=lAFmVsT17iI25nVUvualDg#lAFmVsT17iI25nVUvualDg  A bit greasy due to the grilled poblano and slices of bacon, but very delicious!  The brioche is nice, but I'd like to try it with whole wheat next time.  (If I should ever feel like going for The Classic, I might as well wait for it to go on special-- classic burger and soda for $10, but I'd sub something else for the soda.)

I also tried the delicious Peach Cobbler milkshake special, which goes off the specials board this Sunday to make room for a new selection.  If you like peaches and pies, then you will LOVE this.  Peach puree and marinated peaches (in triple sec, I'm told), homemade caramel sauce, and pie crust** mixed in Hopdoddy's vanilla ice cream base.  Go and get some before it's too late!  

Oh, and many thanks to Jesse for delivering on my request for ice-cold Oak Creek Nut Brown. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hopdoddy-burger-bar-scottsdale?select=DBsmT8GBMoxGjQgo_Qs9kA#DBsmT8GBMoxGjQgo_Qs9kA  I only enjoy beers when they're so cold there are ice crystals in them.  Check back for the photos, which I'll add in a few days.  The frosted glass was gorgeous!

**Made especially for this milkshake.  Hopdoddy's dessert menu only features milkshakes and nothing else.  I really enjoy the one made with Nutella and chocolate-covered pretzels!"}
{"text":"Good burger?

Oh HELLS YES!

Had dinner there Sunday night after picking a friend up at the airport. I arrived late, so missed all of the ordering hub-bub (but it does look super confusing to me - I don't understand how they 'assign' you a table while you're at the counter placing your order. How do you know where to go?). 

Moving past that part.... my burger was waiting for me when I got there. If was PERFECT. Cooked perfectly, super tasty and left me wanting more! (Not because I was hungry but because it was so good, um HELLO super yummy yellow sauce) The fries were tasty, too. 

Didn't have the space in my calorie count that day for a shake, but we'll be back. Definitely will be back.

Gave them 4 stars because their ordering/sitting process seems stupidly more complicated than it should. The concept doesn't make sense at all, and then seeing where the counter is located (passed the bar and into the back of the restaurant) it makes even less sense. The staff were all VERY nice, or at least the ones that I saw at the table."}
{"text":"Talk about LOVE at first BITE! This place was incredible. Loved the atmosphere - it was upbeat, lively, and casual. But the food here is just amazing- I mean it's lit'rally worth writing home about (or at least a review on Yelp) because it's one of the best burger places in all of the lands! The burgers are all made with the freshest and highest quality ingredients and then cooked to perfection! You'll actually be able to taste the difference and then you'll wonder why you haven't eaten here before or why you've ever wasted time with any other burger place. Oh, and let's not forget about their fries! I swear the special seasoning in their fries is crack, because they are SO addictive! My gorgeous date and I shared a large fries and it was PLENTY! They also have a chipotle ketchup that was to die for! 

If you've never been here, you owe it to yourself and your taste buds to stop by and sample some of the best burgers ever made! I recommend the El Diablo burger- it was perfection!"}
{"text":"I was debating on what to give Hopdoddy Burger Bar rating.  3 or 4 stars?  I finally decided on a 3 star (still wish I could give half stars) based on my previous visit to the one in Austin, Tx.  I believe I gave the Austin location on Congress St. 5 stars because I had great food and a great time.  This location in Scottsdale is set up a lot differently and when I came they didn't have any other special burgers to choose from.  I really liked the Austin location where they had a system of ordering and had a chalk board of specialty burgers, along with the standard menu burgers to choose from.  Also they had a bar station while you were walking your way to the counter.  I was happy to see the Scottsdale location offering only local AZ beers as the Austin one only served local TX beers.  

Well after my initial impression my wife and I shared a buffalo bill burger.  It was good, not great.  Meet was very good and bun was fresh but something about it I honestly didn't care for.  I can't base my judgment on one burger alone, so I will come back here and try another one for a more fair review.  

We ordered the garlic fries and they were really good.  Price was actually not bad, but in the gourmet burger market which has seemed to really blow up in the past few years, there are other ones that I would rather go to.  Again, I will be back, the employees working were super nice and friendly, restaurant was clean, good beer selection so I will come back.  Maybe next time they will have additional burgers such as Kobe meat burger or some sort of creation."}
{"text":"Great burgers, shakes and fries . Unique fountain drink selections . Love the truffle fries with a delicious aioli sauce . Full bar . You give order at register then sit . Your food is delivered by a server - interesting touch ."}
{"text":"There are so many choices for burgers in the valley, however this place is a little different. If you like gluten free options, grass fed beef, high quality ingredients made on site such as their ketchup/mustard/BBQ sauces this place is for you!

The green chile burger is my favorite stacked high grass fed beef patties cooked to your liking, spread on a potato bun, and paired with a cold DOS XX it was just what my hangover needed!  

If you go during happy hour they knock off a few bucks on drinks, drafts, and burgers highly recommend."}
{"text":"So I liked this place. It is above average, but definitely not my idea of amazing. 

The burger was great, the fries were good, and the margarita was crap. 

I don't remember what burger I got because it was devoured.  The fries were good, but in general I prefer a thicker fry (meh). 

The problem I had was with the drink.  I had a margarita that was INCREDIBLY BORING. No pizzaz, just blah.  The salt on my rim was gone immediately for some semblance of flavor.  

Other than that, it was decent. :)"}
{"text":"This place has great food.Although, when asked about the Nutella shake that was discontinued, we got  a quick and snippy response. Overall Hopdoddy has great food but some employees could use some customer service practice."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a burger place! Burgers where just a tad to salty but overall not bad. The Parmesan truffle fries where good!! Awesome soda drink selections!!"}
{"text":"This is the most terrible lay out I have ever seen in my life. I am told to order my burger then I will have full service after. What is this horseshit, the 15 year old kid at the counter seems like he has no clue what is going on, tells me I have to pay there so I am forced to order my own drink, fill it up, order my sides and any appetizer. What the hell am I tipping for? They should give two options, one for service, and a second for take out service (which is the only option currently). Will come back if they change this"}
{"text":"Terrible impression from the start. Staff are young kids that aren't concerned with happy customers. It's not a traditional restaurant set up, I'd liken it to a McDonalds experience. If you like standing in line and serving yourself a soft drink at the soda fountain then you will love it. I was expecting to be seated and have a waiter...this is NOT that kind of place. Food overall was ok at best. I had a salad and hubby had the Diablo burger and truffle fries. His burger had a good spice. The beef didn't have a good texture. Our fries were hard and not even hot. The kale salad was ok. With all the great burger places in the valley, I wouldn't repeat this mistake."}
{"text":"My wife and I had Hopdoddy on early evening of March 5, 2016. I had the Magic Shroom Burger, she had the Goodnight/Good Cause and we split the Green Chile Queso. We also had a beer and a soft drink from their root soda fountain. I believe our total was around $26. 

There was a long line that went out the door. It took a little bit of time to get to the counter but the staff was helpful and brought out samples of the shakes and fries while we waited. Once we got through the line and placed our order we were seated and our food came out fairly quickly. 

The Green Chile Queso came out before our burgers and was very good as an appetizer and we continued to munch on it after our burgers came out. Both of these burgers were delicious. I really enjoyed my hamburger, it was cooked all the way through but was still juicy and the toppings really added to the flavors. I was a little skeptical at the thought of having pesto and goat cheese on a burger but it was a good combination and I am hooked. My wife's burger was equally as good. 

Overall the meal was very good. I think the burgers are better than Zinburger and they cost a little less. I see a few comments about the order process and while it is different I did not feel there was any reduction in the service. I really like this place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is super confusing when you first walk in (do I sit down to order? should i save a seat? Do i go to the counter?) but ultimately you order at the counter and they will give you a table number. You get your own soft serve drinks but have a waiter for the able should you want anything else and they will bring you your food. We split a burger with truffle fries and ordered a beer and were pleasantly surprised with everything. They do a burger and beer special for $10 which is a great deal based on the size and quality of the burgers. The atmosphere is industrial hipster and they have a great patio. Neat little place, not as chainy as I expected it to be. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. I had the continental club  (i think thats what it is called). The bun was scrumptious, and soft. I recommend the sweet potato fries. Those were delicious as well. Also the place has great vibes and the employees were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this booming spot here on Scottsdale. Ambiance is very modern cool with an affinity for country western music / stars .. Not sure the affiliation . I ordered the prime time burger with arugula , Brie cheese , onions and steak sauce , hubby got the magic shroom burger . Burgers were good but for 2 burgers and 2 sodas ... 35 with tip seems way over the top expensive ( especially the fact that it doesn't come with fries !) maybe I'm a little old school but, I'll stick with In & Out !"}
{"text":"Update to previous post: After posting my review I was immediately contacted by the regional manager who was very concerned with my experience, he wanted to get to the bottom of it and wanted to make it right. I still don't know if I'll return anytime soon but his response was enough that I wanted to add a couple stars. 

 I had wanted to try this place for some time as I had passed it regularly. We decided to call in an order because we have a small child and did not want to take her out to a restaurant. The person on the phone took our order and told me to pick it up at the bar. The place was very busy (which is great) but when I arrived at the bar the employees seemed very inconvenienced by my presence the manager of this establishment told me my order was in the works and then walked to a server and said aloud \"I F*@&$ing hate people who call in orders\" and went back to his work. This was completely uncalled for as I was extremely patient and understanding to the fact that they were busy and had no idea because I had never been there before. 15 minutes later I received my food and left. They had forgotten to add the avocado that we had paid extra for and the fries were over cooked beyond eating. After telling my wife what the manager had said she decided to call and complain, the manager answered the phone and said that he would never had said something like that (calling me a liar) but apologized anyway for our order and said that if she gave him our address he would send us a gift card (I wasn't comfortable with that but my wife accepted his offer) it's been months later and as expected we never received a gift card. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I've been pretty underwhelmed by all these upscale burger places that have popped up in the valley.  Hopdoddy's left its mark on me though because it's probably the only one where I bit into my burger and thought, \"Whoa, you actually do you get what you pay for.\"  I know they take their ingredients and sourcing very seriously, and you absolutely can tell by the taste of the food.  It was also cooked just like I asked, and oh my god, that's such a nice change."}
{"text":"Pros: Really good burgers great flavors. Really good shakes. Ok fries. Local produce, grass fed burgers. If grass fed isn't a big deal to you google the difference and you will only eat grass fed. 
Cons: price is high
You take a number and sit down after ordering. I wish they had normal servers. 

Return factor 90%"}
{"text":"It was awfully loud and a bit confusing when we ordered. We just milled about near the bar and read the menu. Then we went to the register to order. The girl at the register was very helpful and we got our orders placed. What is wrong with sitting down at a table and ordering?

The food didn't disappoint. I had the Terlingua (burger with chili con carne, corn chips, and cheddar cheese). It was a perfect combination. The amount of toppings didn't make the burger a sloppy mess when I ate it and I could still enjoy all the flavors. We got a large order of fries for the table. They came out first and were a bit cold when we got our burgers.

They have a very nice local beer selection, including a few nice hoppy ones. I didn't care for the chunky goblet-thing they served my beer in, though.

Overall, a great experience with great food and beer."}
{"text":"I love the concept, but the burgers and fries need a little help. The fries were stale and dry. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium, but it was a little more well-done. I think they're close to being really good, but not quite there yet."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 30 min before I overheard an employee tell the people in the front of the line there was a \"burger hold\" so they stopped taking orders for a solid 10 min before we walked out. Good burgers can't make up for poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great burger and service! Wifi wasn't working hard to get an uber orther than that great place!!"}
{"text":"Very good food!!! Great service! We wished the burgers came with fries rather than buying everything separately, but really if that's our biggest complaint, they're doing things right haha. They have fun/different types of sodas, I recommend Blueberry Soda! Yum! I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"The food was great!  The ordering system was not so great.  I was 2nd in line and had to wait a very long time.  I was not a fan of that system.  The fountain drink area was fun since they're different products what you don't expect to see- I like that they switched it up.  Our server was the worst server I'd had in my whole life, I really hope they invest in some training for Mariana if they decide to keep her.  She is completely clueless about everything and rarely finished a sentence; I'm embarrassed for her actually. Other than the weird ordering/ seating process and horrible server, I would recommend this place because the great food and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"So, this place is really fun. You walk in get handed a menu and wait in line. While you're in line they walk around with all kinds of samples of their food and answer questions about the menu. After you pay, you get seated and wait for your food. I got the prime time burger with the garlic Parmesan cheese fries and it was delicious! Parking was relatively easy and it was moderately crowded. The atmosphere is really casual which I love. The only cons I would say is the noise level. I'm not sure if I'm getting old or what but I had a hard time communicating with my hubby over the music and crowd. Other than that service was great and we will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Great fresh burgers perfectly cooked. Everything is Al a Carte and the (small portion of) fresh fries are delicious.. The long line snakes around the front is like waiting for a ride at Disney...and moves just as slowly. I just couldn't figure out why. 
You are funneled past the bar so you can order your drinks while shuffling towards burger heaven.
If they cleaned and bussed the tables promptly maybe that would speed things up a bit.
The waitress assigned seating system is confusing the first time but seems to work. 
Definitely a great burger, in a fun atmosphere.
The biggest drawback? The machine they use to make the handmade shakes sounds like a dentist drill...and its running 95% of the time! Its right by the ordering counter so gets louder and louder as you (slowly) approach. Makes my teeth ache just thinking about it LOL"}
{"text":"Yummy craft beer and healthy options for burgers!  They have a full bar too."}
{"text":"This place is great.

Aside from the rather odd way they take orders and assign tables it's stellar. 

Great burgers, awesome shakes and free parking.

Seriously what else could you ask for? Oooh, great staff, yeah they have too.

If there was one of these in LA I'd be there weekly, unfortunately I'll just have to come back next time I'm in Scottsdale, and next trip I'll have to try the \"hop\" part of Hopdaddy."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Excellent food, amazing staff!!! Out of the park! Best burgers, quality ingredients & reasonably priced. Shakes & fries are delicious. Highly recommend!!!!! Hope to visit again soon before going back home. Hats off to management who clearly care about quality food, service & all around experience! 10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Goodnight burger, regular fries and a soda. Burger was awesome!  I would definitely get it again. Fries were barely warm and not very good. Probably won't get them again. Soda was horrible. Organic food=good idea. Organic soda=I'm not going there for lunch again. I will go back for dinner when I can have a beer with my awesome burger."}
{"text":"Best milkshakes. Oreo and salted caramel are my favorite, but I've tried them all, and all are delicious!

Ambience is great. Casual and hip. 

Burgers are great. They're are many options for everyone, including vegetarian and non read meat options that sound fantastic. 

Servers are friendly and readily available when needed."}
{"text":"WOW really really great burgers.  Been looking for a place since arriving in Scottsdale and found it.   Truffle fries were awesome and aioli was to die for.  Can't wait to return again and again.!"}
{"text":"Particularly fond of this location, I have done work with a  non-profit I work with, as well as eaten here leisurely. The diablo is a personal favorite for when I'm feeling spicy, otherwise the thunderbird is where its at! If youre looking for people to treat you nicely GO HERE"}
{"text":"Great burgers at great prices. There was a long wait but they have a waitress come around, offering to take drink orders - genius. The Shroom burger was really good. Definitely top 10 burger spot. If you're a truffle oil lover, the parmasean truffle fries are a MUST. I tried the Highway IPA which was full of flavor."}
{"text":"Gourmet Burgers. Great taste. Great Service at the bar. My fav -  lamb burger with truffle fries."}
{"text":"This place is quite different than anywhere else I've been before. That being said it is a good thing. It seems they can get quite busy at dinner time. I didn't have to really worry about that around 8:30pm on a Friday though. The outside of the restaurant looks really great and so does the inside. You order at a register and take a seat while you wait for your food. The burger is above average and you can definitely distinguish their burgers from ones that aren't as organic their burger is. The garlic fries are to die for and I suggest getting them. The soda drinks they offer were a little odd but made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. They had diet coke though for those who like that. The people were very friendly and dinner was enjoyable. There are TVs all over the place playing sports so that was a bonus for me. I would go here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in today for lunch. We got amazing service from a bartender named Katie (I believe). She was very attentive and she knew the beer and menu items to the full extent. The food is amazing too. Ask about their weekly special burger. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This food is to die for! I've been here about four times in the last year and each time I had something different. I've had the burgers with bun and without and each time, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Disappointing Lunch

Went to Hopdoddy's yesterday and was very disappointed with every aspect of our meal. We had been to Hopdoddy's 1 previous time and were happy with our experience; however, yesterday I feel I would have enjoyed 5 guys a lot more than Hopdoddys.  We waited in a very slow moving line for 30 min. The cashier was distracted and asked us 3 times what we wanted.  When we finally sat down the server asked again what we had ordered.  Once our food arrived our fries were cold, my child's grilled cheese was just unmelted cheddar cheese between to grilled(on 1 side) hamburger buns.  My wife's burger only had sauce on 1 side, and my burger came out with the bacon sitting on the tray and not in the burger.  Both of our burgers were overcooked and tasted very bland. Once the waitress dropped off the food we did not see her again until she picked up the trays.  Very disappointing meal and we will not be going back as there are much better places for a burger in the valley."}
{"text":"Favorite burger spot in Scottsdale, hands down!! First time there I tried the magic mushroom and the llano pablano... Definitely liked the magic mushroom the best but the pablano was tasty as well. Next trip there I had the prime time... Brie cheese and Carmelized onions, truffle aioli.. Need I say more? The burger was juicy and cooked to perfection! The ahi tuna burger is amazing as well but beware the nori chips are full of wasabi heat!! 

The milkshakes are incredibly delish and those truffle parm fries I dream about maybe once a week!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Came for lunch today. It was busy but the staff is AWSOME. For people saying they are confused on the ordering system I am not sure what they mean???  We sat down and had a great waiter. He was super jealous and did a great job. We all lived out food and I LOVED the Kale salad with chicken patty. Excellent. So for us it was a great value and we will be making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Buffalo Bill is by far the best!!!! You can also order it with an egg on top. I love the chili con queso too, I thought it would be similar chili cheese fries but it's way better and less messy. The chili con queso is a dip and amazing! I also put it on my burger."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!! I avoided the place because it fake and too californiy.  I decided to go in.. I noticed they had their own brand of soda and tea that was tasty.  They mainly only serve hamburgers but they are very good and made well.  The place feel more like a high end diner than a restaurant. It's kinda of like chick-fil-a,. You order in line and then sit down somewhere you like and they bring your food too you.   The service was quick and painless.  Good option for any occasion."}
{"text":"Today my buddies went to lunch at Hopdoddy's Burger Bar @ 20th St & Camelback.  I believe they call that area Camelback Colonnade.  I also heard that HopDoddy brings together the two greatest things on earth - Burgers and Beer.  So why not try it!  Let me tell you folks - the burger was thick and juicy and Kennebec fries were outstanding. Our server was great and was the manager.  We even got a treat.  When we got there right at opening we were the only guess. But when we left it was standing room only.  Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Like anything you order is fresh and amazing.

I have to keep myself from showing up more than twice a week and going to town on their chicken sandwhich, chili con queso fries, and shake.

Seriously, this place is the best."}
{"text":"Stopped in one afternoon on my way through town, and was pleasently surprised! 

First ill start by stating you do wait in line to place an order, and take your number to your table whole you wait for your wait. Now, that being said, its hands down the best quality burger joint run as an ordering line. I, decided to sit in the bar and see what \"hop\" doddy was really all about.

Wow! Again, quality craft beer served in a nice frosted goblet! Beautifully done!
Decided to try the 'La Bandito' with a side of 'Truffle Parmesan Fries' as the burgers do not come with sides. 
Defiantly well worth every penny, and without a doubt will be returning when in the area!"}
{"text":"Crazy burger resto with a very cool vibe and amazing background music. Great variety of burgers milkshakes that look great and a full bar if you like. Excellent selection of local beers and IPA's. I will return!!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to be confused..... 

I hated this place, but their burgers weren't terrible and they had a good deal (a burger and beer for $10) so I won't completely destroy it. 

The entire concept is a complete mess. You stand in line to wait to order your food, but there are no menus readily available so you then stand at the counter trying to figure out what you want to order while everyone else impatiently waits behind you. Then, you get assigned a table (without paying) where you are greeted by server who does absolutely nothing the entire time you are there and then you wait for your food, which is the followed by waiting to receive your check...

So what I'm trying to say is, if you like waiting around, you should come here.

Our \"server\" forgot that we asked for dipping sauce (There is literally nothing else they had to remember) then questioned us when we asked for it again. 

The burgers are tasty, but small for the price. Plus, they don't even come with French fries. 

If you ignore all of the waiting, it has a hip atmosphere which would definitely be a cool place to hang out, but overall, not amused by this restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG! Amazing burger! I gobbled my burger and truffle fries right up! I have never had a burger and fries so delicious! Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to try this place! I've been wanting to come here since they opened, and finally tried it two days ago and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I tried just a classic burger with cheddar and it was delicious! They have super yummy sauces, and my favorite was the chipotle ketchup. I got the truffle Parmesan fries which were amazing, but you could get the plain fries and be very satisfied since they have all the great sauces. The burger was big and lasted me two meals (and it was just as delicious the second time). They also have delicious and interesting soft drinks that are organically sweetened including prickly pair lemonade and blueberry soda. Please go here and support this amazing business and all they stand for."}
{"text":"This place is a win! I came here with a few friends for dinner one night. I'm a burger fan so being here was like being in heaven. 

There's a nice selection of burgers to pick from and the staff is helpful if you need help deciding. They also have amazing Truffle Fries! The vibe of the place is really cool. There's also a bar that seemed to have a good selection of alcohol. The seating is a bit confusing but in the end it works. 

I highly recommend this place! Check it out if you're in the mood for a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, fries, and beer. The buns are baked in house, a lot of micro brews on tap and the burgers are amazing and fresh. Try the Diablo burger if you like a good spicy burger that will make you ask for round two of the brew. Truffle fries are also a must, even though a little pricey but can easily be shared."}
{"text":"Well what a treat it was to find this place while out and about. The fantastic yelp scores are definitely warranted as we've been twice now and each experience was very good. Let's start with the food... it is fantastic! There is an interesting variety of burgers on the menu and everything we've tried has been scrumptious! The burgers could be just a tad bigger, but the flavor is fantastic! There are milkshakes and my kids loved them! Fries are sold separately so the cost does add up, but again it's really really good food. Now for the service...also really good! It's an interesting set up, you walk to the counter to order and they assign you a table. Your food is delivered and servers provide refills, etc. and although you order at a register you pay at the end. The assigned seating thing wasn't managed well on our second visit as they'd set a man and his two small children at a table for six leaving our party of five to squeeze into a table for four with a chair at the end. Not the end of the world but clearly saving the larger tables for larger groups needs to be a priority. I was taken aback when they asked if we would be okay splitting up - uhm no! Not the end of the world but an opportunity.  The environment is very nice and well maintained. It's comfortable and relatively quiet for the size of the restaurant. Thumbs up to this place!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good but not great.  Service was just fine.  
Their concept of getting a beer while waiting in line is kind of gitchy but we bought into the concept and actually enjoyed it.  
We weren't overwhelmed but will try again."}
{"text":"After seeing this place about a year ago I've wanted to try it out as I love a good burger. Went in Sunday night with the girlfriend and was excited to see they were still a good amount of people around 8pm. 

We ordered the Primetime, Arugula Salad and some fries. The fries came out right away and they were really good with the chipotle ketchup. Once the food came out I was impressed with the look of both our meals. Took a bite of my burger and it was like warm at best. I ordered medium rare but that means a warm red center not cold. The server took the plate away and came back shortly after informing me that medium rare came like that...
The arugula salad was amazing and was pretty jealous of my girlfriends meal. The manager came back with my new burger and this one was hot and a lot better but still bland. 

Was expecting a lot more after I had built this place up in my mind."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! This place reminded me of a fancy Smashburger where you wait in line to order food, and they bring it to your table. Get there early of you'll need to wait in line a loooong time!"}
{"text":"Lots of positives: soda variety (orange soda, vanilla creme and Root beer), very delicious and unique shakes (Nutella and Chocolate Pretzel). Great delivery on tasty hand cut fries. Shared the Shroom Burger (goat cheese, mushrooms and mayo) was tasty but too too small with too much mayo. Shared the spinach & Arugula salad - it suffered from the laid out display of contents on tray with not enough cheese but over salted ground chicken patti was the real downer. Would come again but definitely change what we order."}
{"text":"Good food. Confusing concept. Why have a hostess who doesn't seat you? Why not pay at the counter when you order food? Why have a server when you have to go get your own stuff (drinks, condiments etc...)? Truffle parmesan fries are killer!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent got the buffalo bison burger it was very good. The Parmesan truffle fries also excellent. Seems like the ordering and seating issues in the past have been fixed."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. The set up is awkward: you are seated at a table, walk up to put in your order, serve yourself a drink and get your condiments (they don't have access regular ketchup m, you have to ask for it in tiny cups which is very weird considering it is a burger joint...) and then the \"server\" delivers ur burger and checks up on you. Just doesn't make sense. Also, the ingredients were fresh but I wasn't impressed with the taste of anything. It all seemed watery and flavorless. The sauces, the burger, everything. I ordered the classic burger. I probably won't be going back. It was very pricey also."}
{"text":"I'll make it simple.... after receiving our meal, we requested our money back and walked out.  Tuna burger was FROZEN, and the burger was a sopping wet mess that left a giant puddle of water and grease on the tray. 

Also, if you have to explain your ordering process at every step of the way, you're over thinking it. 

If they can't figure it out, this place will not make it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Today I had the Impossible Burger. It is a plant based burger and is out of this world. It is great for vegetarians, such as myself. You can customize this burger to make it a perfect vegan burger if you're into that! I highly recommend this place! It is a bit pricy but you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"In my continual quest for a great hamburger, I discovered this place via Yelp. I have visited 16 out of 20 of GQ's top Hamburgers and I have to say that this place is better than several of them. I would definitely put it on my list of top 20 hamburgers in America. I sat at the bar and I would recommend that if there are seats at the bar, grab them. It is better than standing in line."}
{"text":"Green chili cheese fries are amazing! Service was prompt and friendly. Atmosphere was a cool vibe. We sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night around 6pm and it was packed! I almost wanted to leave because of how chaotic it was. However, we decided to stay since I had a coup for BOGO free burger. I had the ahi and my boyfriend got the la Bandita and we split the green chili cheese fries.

The green chili cheese fries were delicious, I almost got full after eating that alone. The portion is definitely large enough to share. I got the ahi burger with the honey wasabi on the side and am so glad I did. If you don't care for wasabi, ask for it on the side or without it. It was different than any other ahi burger I've had before... messy but delicious. My boyfriend really enjoyed his too.

Aside from the chaotic ordering process and not being able to change the tv (how do you not have a remote to change it to the playoffs?) the food is pretty tasty and worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a confusing environment. I like how they strive for organic and different varieties of burger but it's just too pricy for me. If someone isn't standing at the door to tell you where to go or what to do you would have no idea. Beings it's different but I think the restaurant setup itself makes it difficult to understand as well. Food is still great. Generous amount of beer."}
{"text":"I will make this short.  Food is great!  Terlingua burger is amazing and the Queso fries were really good.  The thing that fell short was the service.  It is a very confusing experience if you have never been here.  You don't know what to do. Do I go the counter and order or do I sit down like a regular restaurant? We were told to order at the counter so we did.  We ordered but could not pay and were told what table to sit at and that we would have full service after that.  So we sat down.  A girl came over and said she would be helping us but that was the last we saw of her until we needed our bill.  We had to get everything for ourselves drinks, etc.  I don't understand how this is full service if you didn't do anything for us.  Once she brought our bill we had to go up the bar to pay because we didn't see her again.  Why make it confusing for the customers?  Why can't we just sit down and you take our order?  I will eat here again just because the food was really good."}
{"text":"Fun place with unique burgers.  I had their season pumpkin bigger last year and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"I originally came here for a Yelp event, and haven't looked back since. I love the variety in their burgers. Not only the toppings, but also the kind of meat they use. Chicken, beef, turkey, buffalo, veggie, etc. You can get whatever makes you happy! The shakes are creamy and delicious. They're a little sneaky, because the bar is in the middle of the restaurant and the line that forms goes right past the bar, so you usually end up buying a beer while waiting in line to order. The biggest change they should make is to let people order from their booths instead of having to wait in line. I have 2 young kids (4 and 2) and waiting in line for 30 mins on a Friday night is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"As my mother observed at a recent outing to Hopdoddy to celebrate her 65th year on this planet, \"this place is kind of like Fudruckers.\" Agreed, Mom, but you forgot to mention that it's a million times better than any other patty slinging place in town.

Just when you think the whole gourmet burger thing is overplayed, which it isn't, but in case you thought that, a place like this comes around and reminds you why America fell in love with the ground beef/bun combo all those years ago. Hopdoddy's offers a unique selection of burgers that don't stray too far from the classic formula, but far enough to make your taste buds sit up and take note. I was about to list some of my favorites, but they are really all so scrumptious that it's hard to single out just a few items, but take my word for it - the burgers rule.

As if that weren't enough, Hoppy D's (what I'm calling it now) also has amazing fries (regular and truffle - dear god, those truffle fries) and homemade sauces for your dipping pleasure.

But wait there's more. They also make milkshakes. Delicious, heavenly milkshakes that will make you wonder what you were drinking before when you thought you were drinking a milkshake.

But wait...THERE'S MORE!!! Yup, they serve beer. On tap. Local. WHAT?! Crazy I know. Don't believe me? Go check it out for yourself. Tasting is believing."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything that could be said about the maddening/idiotic ordering system has been said. We came early on a Friday (had to wait outside behind the \"velvet rope\" for about 10 minutes) and I absolutely know had we gotten there later (and as the line grew) my boyfriend wouldn't have even entertained the thought to wait longer out there. And I wouldn't even try to come here with more than four people.

We talked about how OF COURSE college kids in Austin are fine with waiting in line, drinking fishbowls of beer and dealing with the seating system, but what happens in Scottsdale in August at 115 degrees? Who the hell is going to be OK with waiting then?

(Yes, I saw they have misters, but give me a break)

That all said, the food was delicious and the price point was pretty great. Two burgers and an order of fries came out to under $21. I had their lone veggie burger, the La Bandita. The menu says it's a black bean/corn patty, but, due to it's rosy hue, it had to also contain beets (fine by me, just a note.) I subbed the goat cheese for pepperjack, and that combined with the avocado, arugula and cilantro pesto (no mayo for me) made for a dang tasty burger. Boyfriend had the El Diablo, topped with pepperjack, Carmelized Onions, Habanero and Serrano Chiles, Salsa Roja (no mayo for him either) and he loved it. We split a regular order of their regular fries (skinny, perfectly salted) and it was definitely enough to share. I can only imagine how ridiculous the fries with queso are.

So yeah, we'd love to be back for the food, but it all 100% depends on the line situation. Kind of a shame, really."}
{"text":"Got to sit out a monsoon storm one evening, watching the torrents of rain and strobe-like light show from a booth at Hopdoddy. 

My burger (Buffalo Bill) was perfectly cooked and juicy. The ingedients all tasted real and fresh. The truffle fries were tasty and the vanilla shake did not disappoint. 

My wife ordered the veggie burger which she said was really tasty, but seemed to fall apart in the bun.

All in all, a good experience and look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, and you can't beat the happy hour prices! Friendly staff and quick service, too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Say what 5 star review on a burger joint? Yesterday, we came here with some of our friends and new friends for my first time. At first, I was thinking \"Uggghhh another burger joint!\" But, I was really taken by surprise by the atmosphere, customer service, and the amazing choices that is on their menu, WOOW!
I had the primetime burger, husband had the buffalo bill burger, he had their amazing pumpkin cheesecake shake and we shared their parmesan fries. 
My burger, I loved it. I love brie cheese so having it in my burger was a first time and yet, so tasty. I was also blown away how they had akaushi beef- yummmmm! Not, your regular burger joint! As I'm typing out this review I'm getting soo hungry wanting to come back to get some delicious burger again. :-)
Okay, back to my review! I love love their parmesan fries with the truffle aioli sauce, it's probably one of the best fries I had in a long time or in Arizona! 
The customer service was on point. Our waiter, which I didn't know we had our own waiter until later on. I thought the employees were just going around checking up on all of us. They were amazing! 
We'll be back again now that my friends from Sacramento introduced us to this place. Lol"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I'm not sure what's changed.... My family and I used to go here all the time and it was great. I honestly never do reviews but this was awful and I have to share it. I love this restaurants food and wanted to show my fianc√© how amazing it was too, since he had never been. 

Big fail. 

Here goes... 
The lady that took our order accidentally told us and the couple in front of us the same table number... the server apologized to the people sitting at the table we were also given and we were told to go find a table inside. Unfortunately, we ended up sitting in that same servers section. He never apologized for the confusion but instead told \"hope there aren't anymore issues and I'll be your server\". No smile, no apology for their error, nothing. He left and interacted with the people still sitting at the other table we were given (as we could clearly see them through the giant glass window), but he never even came back to check on us at all until the bill was given to us. Both people that made the mistake walked by our table several times, ignoring us completely and I never even saw a manager walk by at all and ended up leaving very frustrated. 

WORST experience I have ever had. I just love their food but I will never go back to this location. Thanks for ruining my favorite place to stop for burgers."}
{"text":"Great burger bar! Even had gluten friendly options that might be better than the originals. The truffle fries were incredible. It is definitely a place to check out if you like great food and good service."}
{"text":"I came here year ago when I first moved to Arizona and been searching for every since. (Name is hard to remember at first.)
Come to find out it's right down the street from my new job! Jackpot! 
Delicious food, creative selections, great atmosphere and freshly made lemonade (my favorite)."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time! I ordered the Greek and the Parmesan truffle fries, both were amazing. Thanks Matthew for the great service. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This was our second visit , food is delicious , my favorite so far is poblano pepper bacon hamburger, good quality meat , it's real food; both times we had truffle fries , these are the must try, unfortunately yesterday they were old and soggy, if you charge $7.95 for side of fries you should go for a better quality food, price is not a joke and it's still a brand new place so I would say they should keep up on good work and try not to disappoint costumes this early. We came in early and it was slow, service was ok, it would been nice if our server had checked on us before food was gone, we had no chance to complain our cold fries. Milkshakes are great and we love beer selection."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh and hot burger with fries. Never heard of this place but can't wait till go back again."}
{"text":"First visit to this establishment and overall the food was tasty for gourmet burger.Here is my grade:
A  Burger homemade bun
A  Burger Agus Beef
A  Fries
A  Happy Hour specials
A Soft Drinks (Maine Root)
A Quick Service
B Atmosphere (Inside it was COLD) and lighting too dark
B Customer service (some seemed less than enthusiastic, slightly punky)
Think the outdoor patio looks nice and would go back when it gets warmer!!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries w/ Maine Root soft drinks are all tasty. This place has nice patio and very dog friendly. They even have dog bisquits for the dog!  Love their happy hour special pricing."}
{"text":"Ultimately, I'd eat here again. Minus one star due to the slightly confusing setup for ordering/service. It was our first time visiting. The deal is that you are greeted by a host/ess, sent to order at the counter where you don't pay, then sent to an assigned table to wait for your food and be waited upon by a server. You pay your tab at the table.  I feel like we were unintentionally rushed through the whole process of ordering and dining even though it wasn't busy. 

The Magic Shroom Burger was divine. I'm actually not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I was sold on the goat cheese and pesto. I think the tomato on the burger was even salted, which is an amazing touch if that small thing were actually thought about when crafting a burger.

The Green Chili Queso fries were top notch, although the fries could have been salted a little more heavily. 

The Nutella Chocolate Pretzel shake was ho hum. I didn't taste any Nutella. Hmpf!

I'll make a return trip. Yep!"}
{"text":"I would eat here 2 times a week if I could (and didn't mind becoming obese) Burgers are amazing here. They are always cooked to juicy perfection. The greek burger is so damn good it'll make you wanna move to greece. Truffle fries are your sexy little delicious friends. The shakes will leave you disenchanted with shakes from anywhere else. Even the soda fountain offers up non-conventional sodas. Always busy so if you're looking for a quiet night you won't find it here, but great social place to eat some gourmet burgers. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"From the architecture to the first impressions and the fantastic food this place was so worth coming to. It is my first time and I will definitely be back. The Buffalo Bill burger was plenty to fill me up. My gal and I split the large fry. I also am very impressed with the availability on my favorite gluten free beer here in Phoenix. What a great place to be, thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of burger places in Scottsdale and this is my fave.  They make everything from the burgers to the buns.  The ordering system is strange and I am not sure who to tip but besides that this place is the shiznit."}
{"text":"My husband was craving an all American meal: burger fries & a beer so we went to Hopdoddy. I am vegetarian AND gluten intolerant, but I love my hubby so here we are. I ordered the beet, spinach, arugula & goat cheese salad. I'm happy to say their dressing was gluten free. The salad needed more goat cheese in my opinion. I had some of my husband's fries which I'm happy to say are not fried in oil that could cross contaminate gluten free folks.

He really liked the burger and will return without me.....good;) The total cost of the meal was kinda high. A burger, fries (which don't come complimentary with the overpriced burger), beer and salad was $34 and that did not include tip.

Cute place but no reason for me to return, salad is probably not what they do best."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE that they have gluten free buns that don't crumble and fall apart and they actually taste great too! Oh and the fact that they have gluten free buns is a bonus. I really don't enjoy eating burgers protein style. I mean come on. I can get a salad. They also have a dedicated fryer for gluten free fries to avoid cross contamination which is definitely a concern if you have Celiacs. You can check my full review here: http://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/restaurant-review-hopdoddy-burger-bar/"}
{"text":"Ever order at the counter at Wild Flower or Pei Wei, only to find there is no where to sit down? This hip new burger bar takes counter service to the next level. Staff, wearing T-shirts with slogans like \"because your mine, I walk the line\" greet you in line, and hand you a ticket with your reserved table number. Want a specific table? No worries, they will save it for you. 

The special of the day was a \"Boris\" which piled tender pastrami and juicy sour krout on top of a tasty chicken burger. It came on a super soft freshly baked bun with lettuce, tomato and onion for $9. Fries were $3 more but they were thin, crispy and had bits of parsley mixed in. Very tasty. 

The drink options include choices like Blueberry Root  giving their self service fountain a fun twist but there is a single Diet Coke option hidden among the more adventurous flavors. (I found this out when in a panic I asked a passing bus girl \"what if I just want a Diet Coke?!\" and she replied \"then you push the Diet Coke button\")

The milk shake flavors go way beyond strawberry, chocolate and vanilla with options like Red Velvet and Sea Salt Caramel. I actually tasted chunks of sea salt in mine! There is no $5 value menu here. The total for a burger, fries, soda and shake came to just over $20, for one person, but it was enough to share which I did. What? did you really think I ate all that by myself? Don't answer that.

PS I saw an interesting drink go by on a tray, which looked like a frozen margarita with a full upside down Corona bottle sticking out of it. Turns out it was exactly what it looked like. It is called a Skinny Dip. Apparently the beer empties into your glass as you drink your margarita. Hmmm might have to \"share\" that one next time...."}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time. I had heard its like shake shack but its really not. Its much better quality tasting food. I kept it simple and got a basic cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. I didn't do the sassy sauce since I don't like mayo so I did BBQ sauce. The burger was good. Very good. I got a gluten free bun (extra $1.50) it was decent but not the highlight I would get the fresh baked bun next time and suffer a bit lol. Fries were fresh but just ok too skinny for me but they were real potato so that's good. Best thing was the ginger lemonade it was gingeeeery I loved it but no free refill which sucks for $3.50. I'd go again. Wanna try shake and lamb burger some day. Price point is a bit high but occasionally I'd do it, its probably worth it."}
{"text":"Really best burger place in town! Tried diablo burger with fries. Burger comes in very juicy, spicy, fresh and nice looking. 
$10 burger in the \"fast food\" place with upscale feel will make your day. 
Full bar and many choices of beer."}
{"text":"Great burgers, but the price for s a bit high for what it is. $8 to $12 dollars for a burger is expensive. The shakes are incredible here, but once again outrageously priced. $6 to $10 for a shake is pretty insane. With all that said, the burgers and shakes are really good though."}
{"text":"My husband LOVES burgers so we were excited to try this place. I didn't love my burger. It was too greasy for me. The truffle fries and sweet potato fries were amazing though which is why I give it a 3. It's a fun environment and the staff was friendly. Really loud though, so if you're looking for a quieter night out, this probably isn't the best place. Overall good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The hamburger was juicy and delicious. I had the, well I can't remember the one I had, but it had mushrooms and an awesome sauce on it. The Parmesan fries were delicious too. I drank their house made soda (blueberry flavor!) only like 3 refills! The staff was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service and concept had major hiccups.

My friend and I decided to try out this new Hopdoddy location for lunch. It was about 11:45 on a Thursday, and we only had about 45 minutes for lunch before we had to travel back to work. Unfortunately, it ended up being the slowest service, unprofessional servers, and most frustrating dining experience I've had in a while. It took a total of an hour and fifteen minutes to get out of there, after we waited for over 45 minutes to get our food.  

Generally, the concept just wasn't working efficiency-wise from the moment we walked in. We walked in & two minutes later an employee taps us on the back and says \"OH where did you come from I didn't see you walk in\" and hands us more menus, even though we had already grabbed some while we were waiting in line.

After ordering, they place us at an unfavorable 2-top table by the line & Soda machine. I think in restaurant setting like that you should be able to have a say in where you sit, but the choose for you. We asked if we could switch our table to a friendlier one, given half of the tables were empty at the time. They gladly let us move to another one. 35 Minutes later, we still don't have any food or milkshakes. We asked numerous workers if they knew where our food or milkshakes were, they all said they don't know and the \"bar handles that\".  

10 minutes later, it appeared no one had looked into anything, and we had to ask another server who had an unfriendly response of, \"you didn't order through the cashier because we don't see your order. Are you sure you ordered. and are you sure you ordered milkshakes?\" instead of an apology or appropriate response of trying to figure it out.

10 minutes after that, we received our food, which was actually GREAT. We ordered the spinach salad and Thunderbird burger. Both were very tasty. 15 minutes later we still had no milkshakes. Finally we received a milkshake, and then it took another 20 minutes and numerous times of asking servers to get our check. 

I understand it's a new opening, and therefore I would wait a few months to try it again. Their food was great and I'm sure this was not a normal experience."}
{"text":"I was confused by the initial setup. I was greeted by hostess & I told her how many in our party and she told me to go stand at the end of a line where there were already a few people. They don't take your name & how many and give you an approximate wait time, you just wait in this line until it is your turn. Once it is your turn you go to the counter to order & pay for your food. It is also during this time that you are assigned your table #, where you will be sitting. I found it a bit odd that the receipt had the option to write in a tip before you experienced the service but I suppose you could leave that at zero and leave cash on the table. Also while waiting in line a server made the rounds asking if anyone wanted a drink. I ordered a beer and rather than having that added onto my bill I paid her separately.
After ordering you sit and wait for the server to bring you your food. One positive note is that since you already paid when you are finished you can leave whenever, you don't have to try to find your server to get your check and settle up.
I will say that the food was amazing. I ordered the Buffalo Bill and the cashier made the comment that was her favorite. When the server came & was identifying the burgers while passing them out when she came to my Buffalo Bill she also commented how that was her favorite. They weren't lying...this was an awesome burger!! I could say it was on par with Gordon Ramsay BurGR @ Planet Hollywood (at least my burger was).
I was very pleased with the beer selection too...all local breweries, $5 for a good size amount.
I would make a return visit."}
{"text":"Very good burger for a very good price. For two burgers and fries it was just over $20. Happy hour is definitely the way to go if you like the special burger of the month. $5 happy hour burger and $5 on all speciality fries and shakes"}
{"text":"Yet another burger & bar place in the valley. This chain originated in Austin back in 2010 and has spread with plenty of support and plans to continue their expansion, mainly west from the point of origin.

I just think they are so basic! It's kewl that there is a $5 burger of the day,  but In-n-Out is right next door, and sometimes they put some questionable items as the \"deal.\" 

Their beer is simply overpriced as major competition in the area can attest to. I think they had the idea this was going to be lie their Scottsdale location. Whole Foods might be near by, but even that store is more reasonably priced then it's Scottsdale counterpart. 

I would say their meat's calibur is on par with Smash Burger, but with Applebee's prices. It was a bit awkward in their as well. Most of the staff was robotic and it didnt feel personable at all. I don't plan on being a repeat customer if they aren't able to step up and perform at an acceptable level of quality. 

3 stars. You know this some somewhat helpful!"}
{"text":"OMG !

I like NOT love a good burger.

I can honestly say that I have had Zero-Zilch-Nada- No interest in the gourmet burger craze that has been going on. 

With that said I would have never visited this restaurant if it was my choice, just not really interested in gourmet burgers I would rather go to Carls Jr to get a Double western. The best burger ever!

Even though my favorite hamburger comes from a fast food restaurant I still know a good burger when I taste one. 

This place blew me out of the water I had the Bison burger (They have a very specific name for it) protein style. Man this burger was crazy good I cant wait to go back and pay WHATEVER for there burgers making my way through there menu.

Oh yeah service was GREAT from the cashier to the waiter to everyone we passed all friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We ate here for Mother's Day because my mom had loved it previously. The four of us ordered different burgers and 2 sets of chili con queso fries. The fries were delicious but we only got one order. We didn't get the second order until much later and the staff tried to make it better which we appreciated. My husband loved his el Diablo, my stepdad loved his classic. My mom was pleased with her burger (lingua something?) and I was dissatisfied with my continental club, which was not a good turkey burger. My husband said he would definitely return. 12 hours later, 3 of the 4 of us had food poisoning which lasted about 36 hours. This is the only food we all ate that could have made us sick. We no longer feel we will be back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't hold a candle in the wind to other burger joints. Just okay. I've had better. The service was okay. No one seemed to know who was suppose to wait on our table so we had to flag a server down to take care of us."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try some delicious burgers at hopdoddy and the food didn't disappoint. 

With that in mind, when we arrived every customer seemed confused by what to do (not sure why, but it was quite odd). After you've placed your order, you grab your own stuff and then sit down at your pre-assigned seat, when all of the sudden a waiter/waitress appears... please tell me why couldn't we just sit down and have a waitress from the beginning then?? Plus, if most of your staff is standing around you probably aren't utilizing them and if you need to have 2 of them to stand by the door to instruct your customers on what to do, maybe its not a good plan... but I digress. 

I tried the the primetime burger, was pretty good, but would get something different next time. My friend tried the El Diablo burger and was extremely happy with it; I tried a bite and it was delicious. 

Overall, yummy burgers, house-made sauces, and pretty decent drinks."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar.  The bartender Mitchell was attentive but not over powering and was super friendly.  Food came out quick and was delicious.  Such a solid find."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Julio is a great manager. The special today was genius. Thanks.  See you next week"}
{"text":"After my previous review, the manager contacted me and sent me $35 in gift cards, so I had to try it again. It turns out that with careful ordering, you can get a pretty good meal here but there are still rough edges.  Specifically --
1.  Stick to the plain beef hamburger and add a couple of simple extras if you want.  Lettuce, tomato, onions, sassy sauce -- these are fine but the hot sauce is sour, the bacon gets lost in the other flavors, and the chili is a mushy mess. (The egg bun is doughy; try the whole wheat).
2.  Eat your fries as an appetizer as they suggest - they come out crisp but quickly get soggy.
3.  Make sure you tell them what you want served first, if not the fries.  The salads are quite good and you might choose this as your starter.  They are a better value than the $5 fries.
4.  The draft beer is cold and the serving is large - one of the better values in a restaurant that is a shade overpriced on some items."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced.  Frankly I don't get the hype or long lines.  Bar service was slow and although my wife's burger was good, it wasn't worth the $12 they charged. Truffle fries for $6.50 were also a joke. You'll be much happier (and spend a lot less) at Five Guys."}
{"text":"My tummy always has a good time here! Food is so good, I've probably had 6 different burgers and they're all so delish. Definitely a solid spot, and you always leave so satisfied!"}
{"text":"I love Hopdoddy so I'm sad to even be writing a negative review about it. But we went last night for some burger/ veggie burgers. The place was very crowded, and there were no tables available. It was a Friday night around 7:30pm, so this was totally understandable and we were happy to wait. A young girl took my name and told us we were 4th on the waiting list for a table. Totally fine, again we were happy to wait. We sat outside by the complimentary water station as the inside of the restaurant was PACKED! However, we ended up sitting there for 20-25 minutes and watched 5 other parties leave. We figured we'd be the next ones seated but nobody came out to call our name. Then, we saw the party behind us in line get seated and noticed people were ordering at the counter per usual (which they told us we could not do until we had a table number). Figured something was up so I stepped inside and talked to one of the waiters. He gave me a very confused look when I told him someone had taken my name and I was waiting for a table. He then proceeded to talk to the young girl who had taken my name. This girl looked at my boyfriend and I as if she had never seen us before and had no  idea what I was talking about. She proceeded to seat us immediately but it was clear that we were forgotten about and we received no apology at all.  I was very disappointed in the customer service on this visit. The food, as always, was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great quality for the price! Ordered the classic burger, truffle fries and an Oreo shake. I would not order the Oreo shake again because it had a cinnamon or nutmeg flavor that I didn't care for. But I definitely will be back because I loved the burger and fries and I want to order the green chili queso fries!!! And they have homemade fountain sodas!"}
{"text":"Went here this week while visiting the parents in scottsdale and had a great meal before getting on the plan to fly home. Now I have to admit I'm not a meat eater so I can't say anything about the burgers, but the tuna burger I had was one of the best I've had! Cooked medium rare just like it should be and the flavors all went together well. Fries were also yummy, probably ate more of them than I should have and took the rest of my burger home. Also their $10 burger and beer deal that I think goes through the end of the month is a great deal. Service was also great."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast and delicious! You order at the front and they bring your food to you. Very good flavors and the burgers were juicy and cooked well!"}
{"text":"Another in a growing number of gourmet burger restaurants with bar service.  This particular Hopdoddy Burger Bar opened about two months ago, and so it still gets pretty packed at dinner time, and some of the waitstaff are, clearly, still learning the ropes. 

The plusses include a wide variety of customizable burger/sandwich options. The parmesan truffle fries are exquisite, especially with thei chipotle ketchup.  My personal burger favorite is the Terlingua chili cheeseburger  (I substitute the bison patty over the standard beef patty.)  My wife likes the Ahi burger, minus the wasabi sauce.   They have a very nice selection of beers on tap, including several IPAs.  Our children love the burgers, fries and shakes. 

Now let me get to the part that I don't like,  and I'll make it short and simple.  If I'm going to pay sit-down restaurant prices for a gourmet burger dinner, and if there are waitstaff who expect a tip for table service, then why does Hopdoddy expect me to stand in line at a counter and order my meal like I was at McDonald's or Wendy's (and where the food is cheaper and there are no waitstaff who are expecting a tip)?  I find this service model to be very off-putting and, frankly, quite irritating.  In fact, it is so annoying that I struggled to give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 3 stars.  But those parmesan fries are so darned good...."}
{"text":"Okay, Hopdoddy, this is starting to sound like a love/hate relationship.  I still love you, but we've got some issues.  First up, \"Medium Rare\"  When I order a burger medium rare it's okay for the cashier to confirm, as in, \"you like that with a warm, red center, right?\"  Yes, that is okay.  But when she asks a second time within seconds, you want a warm, red center, right?  Listen, I want it medium rare.  If somehow you think I am deviating from the standard definition, you are wrong.  Next, you deliver my burger and repeat, \"warm, red center\".  FFS already.  This tells me that either you don't trust me to know what medium rare is, you staff doesn't know what medium rare is, and for damn sure when the burger is delivered medium-well, your chef doesn't know what medium rare is.  Or, warm, red center for that matter.  So somebody needs to get a clue, and it's not me.

Second up, we requested a second order of your delicious Kennebec Fries from the server.  Eventually, he dropped off a ticket for this and said, \"just pay me when you are ready\".  We waited for like ten minutes for him to come back by, and I finally got tired of waiting, and went to the cashier.  Now the cashier cannot take my money, she has to go track down the server to have him take my money.  There's a flaw in that process if you have to track down a disappearing server to pay for your ticket.

Apart from that, my medium-well, warm, red center burger was just as fresh and tasty as usual."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with my family and it was great. The menu is pretty unique but there are classics. Today I ordered the Greek, it's a lamb burger with feta, arugala, pickled onion, and tomato. I happen to get lamb burgers whenever I see them and this one is really good. My daughter got a kids burger and fries and she also enjoyed her meal. I was really impressed by their drinks too.We will be coming back and I plan on bringing some friends next time."}
{"text":"I've come to HopDoddy quite a few times. The first time, I was a little confused my how the seating worked. After sitting and ordering we waited for our food for a bit. Given the restaurant was quite busy, our food was delicious and we were impressed by the presentation. Service however on my first visit was atrocious and I waited 2o minutes for the waitress to come and give me my check and another 25 minutes for change. This is now I believe my fourth time here and the service provided by Meghan has been the best so far. She was friendly and smiling and offered suggestions on my next burger: ad avocado to the poblano burger so it contrasts the spiciness if the peppers and your mouth isn't as fire for so long. I will continue returning to HopDoddy thanks to Meghan and her service and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"First impression was this place is kickin': line of folks outside, food looked good from the window, lots of awesome points. But then you notice the empty tables, and wonder why they dont seat the 25 minute line outside. They can take drink orders as you wait but once youre allowed inside, theres more of the same line to order your food. A server or hostess , I'm not sure who, walks up and asks how many we have and then says, \"Im going to go find you a table and I'll be back.\" My impression is that this is really inefficient. People running back and forth trying to keep track with paper and pen where we can sit... I would consider getting an ipad or some electronic reader that people can mark off unavailable seats and it updates in real time. 

We order, get our condiments,  and drinks, only to now go look for our seat in a section they assigned us. Wasnt hard by the way but still had to look for it.

Food came soon after: red velvet shake-bomb.com, prime time burger- great but I couldnt really taste the brie, CARAMELIZED ONIONS ARE OH MY GOD GOOD, el diablo burger was spicy as hell but awesome, chile con queso fries are stupid good and the queso on the diablo is ridunculous.

Overall really damn good food and i really give it 4.5 stars but just slightly disappointed with the inefficiency."}
{"text":"I've don't usually feel the need to write yelp reviews however this time my experience was so bad I felt I needed to. The brand new manager who by the way never came and greeted a single table or introduced herself was very rude and defensive when I asked her about the gentleman serving us and the problem I had during my meal. 

The young man that was serving us was slow and  ill-responsive. By the time I left I was very disappointed with customer service and felt disrespected and unwelcome by the manager. She made it so that my family member who by the way used to work there for over a year and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"One word: overpriced. Another three: Glorified fast-food. So you order like a fast-food/take out joint, then take a seat and they bring you your food and make a token \"everything ok\" stop. The milkshakes were to-die for (literally, probably shortening your life span by a few weeks due to the sheer fat & calorie count).  The burgers were pretty good, the \"not-to-be-missed\" truffle fries were over-exaggerated IMHO. Loud music, uncomfortable seats. Won't be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place ever since they opened up. I've been driving by this place a few times a week since they opened. So today was the day. I was excited with anticipation because of all the reviews. 

When we first walked in, we were greet with a smiling face and handed a menu. It seems like a lot of newly opened place are using this system. Order and pay then they will serve you at your table. One difference between the other places is Hopdoddy reserves your table while you wait in line. 

I ordered the Buffalo Bill Burger which is buffalo and the Kennebec fries. I really enjoyed it. Nice and juicy with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. Yum yum. The fries were so fresh. I ordered a large fries to split with my family. They were so hot (temp). Everyone couldnt stop eating the fries. My wife ordered the Continental Club Burger which is the Turkey burger with grilled onions. She really enjoyed the burger which is surprising because she never likes burgers. I tried it and it was really juicy and cooked perfect. Really good. 

The service was surprisingly good. Once we sat at our booth, our server introduced herself and said that she was going to take care of us. She brought us out all of their different ketchups. She was even willing to fill up our drinks even through the drinks are self serve. The trays were cleared from our table in a timely manner. 

Overall, I wasn't disappointment. I had a really good time and good food. Enjoy cause I sure did."}
{"text":"Poor Service, cold food & too expensive for the quality and service. Ordering system is terrible. Rude bartender, food was delivered cold, when we complained, the server never came back... So, neither will I."}
{"text":"I have been here twice thus far and I must say I am a big fan. I have only ordered to go, once at the bar and the bartender was super nice (heyyy bartender guy who I forgot your name) and the last time was an over the phone order. I knew what to expect as far as ordering based on my Yelp fam so when I went in for the first time I ordered my to go from the bar and it was really easy, just tell em what ya want..the end. When I called to place my second order I said to the guy I want 2 Hopdoddy burgers please, the guy says we don't have a burger by that name, I said welllllll you should (my bad). Ok so what is the regular burger called? Just FYI it is called the \"classic burger\" people..lol. I have only tried the classic burger and I must say it was absolutely delish both times I had it. I tried the truffle fries which were good and also the K something fries (i.e. regular fries), I am probably one in a thousand but I actually prefer the regular fries over the truffle. All in all great burger and great bar service."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their ordering system, come in order at a counter then sit down for delivery. Would have much preferred to sit down and order like at a normal restaurant.  Burgers were extremely tasty as was the gourmet style milkshakes.  Sodas are not your typical coke/pepsi products but vanilla cream, etc.  Has a small bar with a small selection of microbrewed beer but nothing really to write home about.  Dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"One star tonight, because when I sit at a bar I would prefer to not hear the bartenders complain about work, and how \"pissed\" off they were/are. I'm a guest and have to tip you, please don't be a drag, I'm there after my long work day to enjoy myself. 

Also sadly there was no thank you from either bartender. 

All that aside, good fresh tasting burger and fries . I frequently go there, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here yesterday. The burgers were delicious and the Uncle Bear's Mandarin Wheat beer was superb, albeit I have to say that I had just finished 4 hours of golf in the 100+ degrees.  Will be back, especially when they open up at The Biltmore."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
- Food is perfect
- Prices are reasonable
- Service is great
- Management is doing a great job and makes it a great experience.

Best place for a burger in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh fresh fresh! They prepare their burgers fresh everyday. They are never frozen. I always get my burger on a gluten free bun which is amazing. It's like a cornbread biscuits. It's so delicious. You have to try the green chile Queso fries. You will think you died and landed in food heaven. I have a serious addiction going on with these fries. They are so good. I've been here several times in the last couple of months and it is always consistent. Fresh and tasty every single time. The staff is also super helpful and everyone seems like they love their job! I say this is the best burger place in Arizona! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Hopdoddys. 

I an Arizona Native and over 21 so I usually avoid Scottsdale in general but I liked this.

Everything tasted fresh and came out hot. 

I will say that the queso was a waste of money- not very good or interesting. Next time I go I will definitely try a salad. 

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love burgers and love this place! Tried/ split the Diablo with avocado and the prime time. The Diablo is amazing if you like spicy. The prime time was good but not as flavorful as the Diablo. Enjoyed a mandarin wheat beer as well that hit the spot. The truffle fries were to die for, and the green chili queso were decent, not bad though. My only reservation is the disconnect between ordering and a server, but not a dislike enough to not come back. The honey mustard was tasty as well."}
{"text":"This is a stupid concept. They have a very confusing and added steps to the simple process of fast food. After waiting 10 minutes in line for a beer the told me to sit down at the bar, where I could also order food. While everyone else stands in line and then is told what table to take. So I sit at the bar for 10 more minutes. Finally a shake making person asked what I would like to drink i said a Pilsner, then she went back to making shakes. No beer and no order taken after 20 minutes of being there. I left and will never return. Good luck."}
{"text":"It was like Zen Burger. Good quality beef. I got the Prime time burger hubs got the el diablo burger.  Side of parm truffle fries.  I liked my burger but my husband's was better.  Loved the spiciness of it."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy never disappoints! Anything from their regular burger to a specialty burger is always made so well. Their meat is always flavorful and juicy. They cook your burger to order which is huge, a lot of places won't or do a poor job. I usually get medium, and they always deliver with a red center. Their truffle fries are always crisp! The staff and environment here still have some of that Austin feel and I'm glad they are able to replicate what made this Texas favorite so great, here in AZ."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how delicious these burgers are! They are so fresh and always cooked perfectly! Those buns are amazingly fresh too! The fries are nice and thin so they get super crispy. Try them with the chili cheese dip!! Shakes are the bomb, an absolute must even if you're stuffed. Chocolate stout and red velvet are our favorites. Adult drinks are good too. Love the PV tea!"}
{"text":"This has to be my all time favorite restaurant now. The food was amazing and the drinks were on point. Our server was also the bartender and he did an amazing job at giving us the ultimate Hopdoddy experience. I HIGHLY recommend the green chile queso fries. Burgers are also great, I got the goodnight good cause burger and man I will say best one I've had in awhile. Thanks Hopdoddy employees!!"}
{"text":"Like most people have already commented on, the logistics of the places is weird, but you'll  have to get over that and enjoy some good burgers. My boyfriend and I came here when they had their beer and burger for $10 promo, which was a steal considering we got 2 of the more expensive choices. Who doesn't like a deal that makes your meal cheaper and comes with beer...haters (of course) lol. We got the primetime, the Buffalo Bill burger with truffle fries and 2 draft beers. The primetime was to die for, I finished my half before I took the first bite. The creaminess of the  brie (I love brie) just went so well with the tender akashi beef. The Buffalo Bill was a little disappointing, because the whole burger was overwhelmed by the hot sauce you couldn't really even taste anything else. I substituted the blue cheese for goat cheese which cut down on the saltiness caused by the hot sauce, but it wasn't enough. Sad really, because buffalo is delicious. The fries were good, not extraordinary nor poor, but a little pricey. The nutella pretzel shake which I trying to avoid, because calories you know, was fantastic. I would just give in and order one. I like that it was rich and creamy but not overly sweet to the point where you think you'll get a cavity. And the pretzels add that salty crunch that really contrasts with the creamy chocolate sensation. Will definately be back to try some of their seasonal offerings as well as that lamb burger."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy is a good restaurant with a terrible ordering system.  Instead of having waiters and waitresses, you stand in a long line to order food that is brought to you later.

Problems with this process:

Open tables are abound, but you stand in line for 20 minutes.

You order once, and food is brought to you.  There is no way to order more food or drinks.

The burgers were good, staff was friendly, but the experience poor.

I'll come back when they rethink the process, as it is pointless.

Avoid unless you like lines."}
{"text":"Fantastic! From the burgers to the fries, to the delicious shakes. If you come, be ready to eat! I was shocked to find they have gluten free buns and they are delicious. The system for ordering is unique, but they have it figured out and the line moves very quickly. Even if the line is out the door , you would be well advised to wait."}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing! I ordered a lettuce wrap bison burger and it was water to my mouth. My mother loved her Diablo burger with its spice the truffle fries looked and smelled amazing. I immediately check for other locations in California so I could stop by again. This will be a stop for me on my Arizona road trips."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place for burgers that are a little different. The environment is comfortable and the food is delicious. This is my second time back and I have yet to be disappointed. I would definitely recommend the truffle fries! They are delicious! 

They have some really great beers and in the full bar right in the middle of the restaurant. Overall, great food and a really relaxed environment. It's a little on the pricey side as far as burgers go, but it's completely worth it. 

Also, definitely have the milk shake after your meal! One of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This will be my new go to place for a gourmet burger! Had a delicious grass fed bison burger. Love how you can completely customize any burger & all of the ingredients are high quality & fresh. Great friendly service and a cool atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to go after work as a quick happy hour. 3-6:30 $5 cocktails!! And the bubbly blonde is my favorite! (House infused st. Germain, sustainable white wine, lemon, orange, bubbles, and basil) Definitely recommend if your just trying to grab a causal drink and a quick bite. Ambiance is laid back and staff is all very very nice."}
{"text":"Love Hopdoddy's burgers! Always juicy, flavorful and so crave-able! They make awesome shakes and have a full bar.  Kids' meal of a burger, fries and a drink is $6.  Their fountain sodas are not your regular Pepsi/Coke stuff, they are artisanal small brand items.  Protein style no bun burgers are also available."}
{"text":"Local beers, good price, friendly staff, and awesome atmosphere. My new favorite burger joint in Arizona. The truffle fries are a must try and the El Diablo burger with a fried egg was just the right amount of spicy for me, a little to spicy for my buddy but it was too good and he ate it all anyway. 
Will return again and again."}
{"text":"The white truffle fries were amazing! Went with 3 friends and all burgers were slightly more cooked than ordered, so if you like a medium burger, consider ordering medium rare. Burgers were delicious! The staff was friendly, attentive and very helpful. Atmosphere is fun, relaxed and very family friendly. Recommend this to any and all who like burgers, fries and shakes."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  No lines at Camelback and 20th St location. They process their own meats daily and have good brews on tap. Great customer service!  I think we will become regulars!"}
{"text":"The Good:  very friendly service, punny shirts, a cool aesthetic especially architecturally on the outside, very clean. 

The Mediocre:  Price is a little much... two classic burgers, french fries, one salad and a shake is $50.
The food, my first question is how does a burger bar not offer \"medium rare\"?  I wanted this place to slay burgers but it doesn't.  I feel bad giving the food a bad review but it just really wasn't that good.   

The Bad:  nothing bad to say

Note:  obviously any food review is subjective, try it for yourself"}
{"text":"I'm not one to crave a burger very often but if I did, I would definitely come here. There has been a line out the door the 2 times I have been there, but I was not in a rush so didn't mind. 
They assign you a table right before you're about to order and I've been lucky each time as to get a \"private\" table, since they sometimes seat you at a table where other people are seated and put some BS divider on the table to give the illusion you are separated. All that does is prevent you from looking at the person's food who you are sitting right next to. You are still sitting next to them and can see them clearly so don't see how that helps anything. 
Moving on. I had The Goodnight burger because the carmelized onions, jalapenos and sassy sauce (assumed it was the house sauce and was right) caught my eye. I really like the bun they use too. Delicious!
I favor light beers so tried the one from Grand Canyon Brewing Co. and I loved it. This will definitely be my beer of choice when I return. 
I absolutely hated the milkshakes. Ordered a chocolate one and it was so bad that I asked to switch it for a different flavor which they did with no problems at all. I got the vanilla and it was just as bad as the chocolate. There's some kind of weird cinnamon number on it and it tastes awful. 
Definitely stick to the burgers and beer combo! 
The staff is very young but very nice and professional."}
{"text":"Good food. My boyfriend got the bison burger and it was drenched in Frank's Red Hot. It was advertised that way but he didn't realize somehow. That one is on him for sure, but it was a somewhat overwhelming amount of sauce, plus I just find it odd to completely mask the flavor of the bison like that. 

I got the vegan burger that \"tastes like meat\"- I don't remember what it was called. It was ok. I've wanted to try that brand of burgers for a while and I wasn't super psyched on it.  Honestly wouldn't order again at that price.

The Ahi Tuna burger is DELICIOUS even cold. The flavors all mesh incredibly well. 

Decent beer selection, the staff is friendly and attentive, cool environment and full service bar.  I'll probably return to try the black bean burger."}
{"text":"We  went here last night. I have to say the food was fantastic and as the host said to us when we walked in \"it's worth the wait.\" The truffle fries and ranch had to be some of the best I have had, and I am one of those people that LOVE FRIES AND RANCH!.  The burger was really tasty and I was looking forward to eating the other half this morning. As I get ready to take a bite I notice long hair hanging out of my burger. I think oh maybe it's mine....then I open it up and NOPE it was melted under the cheese and bacon and I know it for sure wasn't mine at this point. Really disappointed I didn't get to eat the entire burger. Rating would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"Such high expectations, but in return all I got was a well done dry burger with flavorless meat that tried to be masked by good toppings.  

I seriously don't get all of the hype.  They could have had an off night - everyone at my table had a similar impression."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger!! In from out of town and this has been the best meal by far. If you're here visiting and people talk about this place...believe the hype!"}
{"text":"So friggin' good! Fast service, excellent food, great atmosphere. Llano Poblano, Diablo (spicy!), & Tuna burger, EXCELLENT. I don't give 5-starts too often. The Little Prick wasn't great, figures..."}
{"text":"Great... No, amazing burgers, awesome fries, you have to try the shakes, all at really surprisingly low prices!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice.  The first time was amazing!  A busy Friday night... Great service and the burgers were excellent.  I got something with chili on it--way out of the norm for me--but it was really good.  My husband got the jalape√±o and habanero burger and was sweating bullets (apparently that's the desired outcome).

Second time was a different story.  Weather was great so we opted to sit outside.  Before our drinks arrived we switched to a different table because the wind had picked up and our daughter was working on homework while we waited for the food to arrive.  Husband ran inside to let the staff know.  They gave us a new number and said it wouldn't be a problem.  Three different people came over to express confusion about us switching tables, our food was delivered, minus one item (a large fry to split among the family).  After that we never heard from or saw another person who worked there.  It was absolutely nuts.  We were the only ones on the patio at that point and were apparently completely forgotten about--as was our large fry.  We actually had to go inside and find someone to get the bill (a good twenty minutes after we had finished eating).

The sweet but clearly overwhelmed server apologized profusely and offered to have the fries we never received packed up to go.  We declined.  Not even sure he was working the patio or if he was the poor schmuck sent to deal with the red-headed stepchildren on the patio.

Hopefully this proves to be the exception and not the rule since the service was wonderful the first time we went and the burgers really are pretty good. 

We'll probably give it one more shot before switching back to the burger-and-beer special Whole Foods runs."}
{"text":"This place is super busy! Either go early or wait til after the dinner rush or else you'll be standing in a line outside the door. However, once you do get in, the food is really excellent. I got the llano poblano burger which I highly recommend. Everything was high quality from the bun to the bacon on top. But the real show stopper here: TRUFFLE FRIES. At first, the thought of paying $6 for fries was utterly disturbing to me, but when my boyfriend and I saw the size of the portion, we were cool with sharing a batch. 
EAT THE TRUFFLE FRIES. IF YOU DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE, THAT IS OK. BUT EAT THOSE FRIES.
Side note: the guy who stood outside the door to greet customers and hand out menus was wearing a shirt that said \"burger bouncer\" and I thought it was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers, Amazing Fries.  Natural Soda bar.  That is all you need to know.  Go there"}
{"text":"Just checked out this lil burger bar the other day and found it to be pretty enjoyable. The burger was good but the fries were eh. I should have just went with the truffle fries like previously recommended but I went with the reg. I'll definitely try the truffle fries next time. The feel of the restaurant is quite nice. It feels laid back, kind of like a sports bar yet nicer and newer. They have TV's so you can watch a game, a bar area, and a sort of unique way of ordering (order food at the counter then they'll bring it to you). 

This place isn't amazing but it's a fun, chill place to get decent food. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"The El Diablo burger is amazing for anyone who likes food with a kick (Serrano's and habaneros)!  Avoid sitting at the bar during the week, the weekday bartender is easily distracted.  The weekend bartenders are awesome - attentive without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight (8pm on a Thurs). We were seated right away, and a server actually took our orders ( they said when it's slower they do table service). I had the hail Caesar salad. It was amazing. It was definitely different than a traditional casear, with tomatoes, carrots, crunchy potatoe shoestrings and amazing crunchy chickpeas. Everyone was very friendly.  Only complaint was it took a little long to pay the bill, but since typically you pay at the counter, it's not a big deal. If bikini season wasn't so close, I would have loved to try the Nutella and pretzel milkshake.....they looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are so good! But the fries is what really blows it out of the park for me. They give you a generous amount and all the fries are delicious. Their shakes are delicious as well I like them more then shakes from Shake Shack. 

Happy hour 3 to 6:30 Mon to Fri - $6 burgers and fries

I love that the sauces are all out and easily accessible."}
{"text":"Waited in a very long line and had 2 line holds while we were in line because the waiters were mixing up burgers and not staying on track with the cooks. About 45 minutes later get to the counter and I'm excited to order the impossible burger because I am vegan. Was told that they have been out of impossible patties for a while. I should've been told that when I first walked in. They named other vegan burgers so I got the black bean burger and it came out dry and crumbly. They also forgot the onions in the burger. I've had a decent visit before but the rest were not very close to being good and far from great. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I was pleased. For me... it wasn't anything extraordinary. I like the vibe/decor. I'm always a fan of open and airy. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. My food was good, but since their specialty IS burgers I expected a little bit more of a \"wow\" factor. 

Alas, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hopdoddy burger bar and grill, what a place to have lunch, what a unique arrangement as far as ordering, you can go to the counter quickly and get your order just like how fast food works, they deliver your food once it is cook to your specification.  You can also just order from the waitress or waiter if you opt not go on the counter.  The place have outside sitting, indoor bar, booths and table with tv broadcasting any sports that are currently playing (just like any sports bar.  

I had a bison burger and garlic/Parmesan ... oh that was delicious.  If you are not familiar with bison, In my opinion it taste better than the regular \"cow\" meat / burger we usually get.  The attendants  in this place are very friendly, hospitable and GO out to the extent to provide good service, the place is clean, the rest room is clean and sanitary and if I ever come back in Scottsdale AZ I will sure to visit this place and eat here.  I recommend for those who are passing by to come and try this experience."}
{"text":"We are at Town & Country a lot and have always wondered about this place. After eating there yesterday, we are kicking ourselves that we didn't try it sooner! We ordered Thunderbird chicken was amazingly tasty and had great kick to it! We also got a burger - cooked to perfection and wonderful flavor!  Cut each in 1/2 and shared so that we could each try each other's order.  Fries didn't get to hang around long as we scarfed them down! Delicious. Soda made with pure sugar reminded us of the old days, how soda used to taste.  We got the root beer. Servers we're friendly and helpful from the moment we entered. We are looking forward to our next visit already! 

PS .. I read a couple of the reviews and people were very happy with the restaurant but only gave four stars. Not sure why.  It's 5 star  IMO"}
{"text":"I visited Hopdoddy recently and tried their \"La bandita\" veggie burger (oh so filling and so dee-lish) fries and a red velvet shake. Gotta say, it was pretty darn good. They were very friendly in explaining their process and answering some questions I had as it was my first time. Their soda selection is lovely as well with their cane sugar options instead of HFCS crap. They also have a great selection of adult beverages if you're so inclined. I will definitely be returning soon and sampling that veggie burger with different topping options!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place on a weekday afternoon, right before lunch hour. We heard about their great burger and beer selection and were eager to give this a go. 
As per the other comments, Hopdoddy is a walk up and order restaurant and then you wait your food while at your self-selected table. 
They offer an amazing selection of fancy burgers all with apparent local farm supplied ties and it is impressive what they can do with a burger per their menu
The self service soda machine was also unique with a selection of home made root beer and blueberry (!) soda.
Now the beer selection was disappointing in that not a wide selection was on tap. I incorrectly assumed with \"Hop\" in the title the beer selection would be awe inspiring yet it was just meh. Some local faves (Four Peaks, San Tan) were offered yet nothing to write home about.
All in all, was very enjoyable time yet it seemed steep to spend almost $40 for the two of us for two burgers and two drinks (no booze even).  
Based on the other reviews and how busy this place was during our visit, it appears to have mass appeal yet I don't see a return trip unless under the influence of a Groupon (or someone else picks up the tab)."}
{"text":"OMG! This place has the best burgers in town. I ordered Primetime, my hubby had El Diablo and my friend had Llano Poblano. All of us enjoyed perfectly cooked juicy burgers. Oh and we shared truffle fries and was crisp and seasoned perfectly. They do offer condiments but everything was seasoned just right and didn't need any additional sauces to kill the flavor. No one complained and enjoyed every single bite. Can't wait to be back soon to try other items."}
{"text":"Great service. Very nice atmosphere. The magic 'shroom burger was fantastic! And the ginger lemonade is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere. The 20th Street and Camelback location is awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was exceptional, burgers were cooked perfectly, cheese was fully melted, Parmesan truffle fries were a hit with the one year old. 

I could describe the whole meal and it wouldn't do justice to the work put in by the front and back of house. While it is also a bar setting the atmosphere was welcoming enough to make you not feel like a burden bringing your kiddo. 

Honestly it was the closest I've felt to the community you feel in the Portland food scene. It felt like home. Well done and thank you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints! I usually get the magic shroom burger w a fried egg. But once in a while I get the specials for Thanksgiving!  The green chili cheese fries are the best! Their shakes are delicious. Service has changed so many times (pay at counter, pay at table, pay at counter... It seems to always be something new.. but we keep going back because it's delicious. My friend's even like the salads!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!! It is about a 30/45 min drive for me, but totally worth it!  

I always order the magic shroom burger with a fried egg. It is delish!  I stick w what I like, out of fear of being disappointed w something else. My friends have tried almost all of the various burgers and loved every one of them. 

The green chili con queso fries are tasty!  I've tried the Nutella chocolate pretzel shake and the raspberry white chocolate one. Both are great!  The wider straw helps to drink the thick shake :) 

The workers have been super kind and friendly every time I've been in!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this particular location.  Ordered a shake but the machine was broken. Ordered the Llano Poblano burger.  I asked for medium but got well done. Dry and disappointing.  I've been telling people Hopdoddy's is one of the best burgers in Phoenix but I may tone that down."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a great tasting burger! The Goodnight GoodCause burger is amazing and tastes great each time I get it. They also have a good selection of draft beers. Good, fast service too."}
{"text":"I never took them up on it, just noticed their email to me and an offer for a free meal on them. I have to give props any time someone improves upon their service. Their burgers are the bomb so here are you 4 other stars! Thank you for attempting to make good on a bad exp"}
{"text":"Bison burger was awesome! Cooked exactly as I had asked. Must try is the green chile queso with fries!  They have a wide variety of burgers to choose from including Tuna and lamb. Definately the burger spot in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Another fast casual type place but with a little more service. The line was long and there was only one person taking orders at the counter. They assign you a table based on your party but you get your own drinks and they bring your food out to you. My boyfriend got the Primetime and he really liked it. I got the La Bandita and it was meh. First off it was pink which I was caught off guard because it's bean and corn, the goat cheese was very powerful that is all I could taste. The patty itself just seemed bland and tasted as if there were beets in it but that wasn't on the list of ingredients? Idk. Wouldn't order it again. The sweet potato fries were good and the sauce it came with was also super good! The restaurant was clean and I will give it another shot if my boyfriend wants to eat there again but won't order the La Bandita."}
{"text":"Tried take out again. Still great food, but their system simply can't handle take out well.  Saw a few tables who ordered after me, get food before me.  I didn't have a complex order either.  Stick to eating in, and it'll be great."}
{"text":"Update: STILL LOVE Hopdaddu! Sat inside at the counter, had excellent service, EXCELLENT bison burgers! THE PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES---OH MY! STILL THE BEST! The staff here is SUPER helpful, easy and all about you having this burger experience."}
{"text":"Exceptional! The goodnight burger was best burger I've had in a long time. Been so disappointed with Zinburger. New #1 place!"}
{"text":"I hate going here....but they have my impossible burger.  

The food is good but I always find myself getting annoyed with how this place runs.  They put you in line to order and it takes forever because they NEVER have more than one cashier/order taker.  Doesn't matter if there's 20 people in line.  Two groups in front of us today still took 25 minutes to order because they all decided to pay individually - why make the whole restaurant wait for 6 people to basically split a check and run credit cards one at a time?  So after standing in line for 25 minutes, you are reminded to tip and it's full service but it couldn't be further from the truth.  You get your own condiments, drinks and refills and you pay before you get your service... Nothing at this restaurant makes any sense and for $55 for burgers for a family of 4, I would expect a lot better service.

If it weren't for the limited availability of a good impossible burger I would have just not written anything and never returned."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in the valley.  This is the second location I've been to, and this place continues to impress.

The burgers are fantastic and there are tons of options.  Being the extremely boring person I am, I usually just get the Classic Burger (which is still one of the best you will find anywhere).  Juicy and delicious.  The fries are also pretty good too, although I wish they gave you more in the larger size.

I've also tried their S'mores milkshake, which was decent.  They cover it with pieces of graham cracker, however, these all just sank to the bottom once we started working on it, and they were a soggy looking mess at the bottom towards the end.  I'd be interested in trying one of their other flavors though.  As with the burgers, there was great selection.

Service is also fantastic.  Someone is always looking at for you even though it's not a real 'formal' restaurant.  If you love hamburgers (and really who doesn't?) you gotta give this place a look!"}
{"text":"The burger tasted great.  We went on a really busy day, so I'm not sure if the wait was worth it, but it was still good.  Definitely not the cheapest place to eat at, though."}
{"text":"I don't know that we needed another $10 burger in the 'hood. But we've got one now. At least it's not another premium pizza place. We have all the burgers and pizza you could possibly want within walking distance. It's like everyone around here never left summer camp. 

But I'm here to talk about this place, and not just complain about our national state of extended early adolescence. We're all callow goobers who watch superhero movies and eat pizza and wear little baseball caps and can't stop watching porn. America. 

Anyway. Where was I? Oh, the burgers.

Yeah, they're ok. They're mainly salt. As salty as the burgers are, the fries are even saltier. I don't know why they bother with salt shakers on the table. I can't imagine anyone thinking anything needed more salt. I think I shrank 5% from dehydration from one meal. 

Hopdoddy features a full bar, which probably explains the avalanche of salt. 

There appears to be little on the menu you can't get at Smashburger, or Zinburger, or The Habit, or The Grind, or Delux, or . . . 

Hey, did you know they're putting an In-and-Out across the street? At least those are more like $7 burgers. Burger burger burger burger burger. Burgers. We got burgers.

Anyway, what Hopdoddy lacks in a varied menu, they make up for with this: Ordering there is weirdly inconvenient. You walk to the kitchen counter after talking to a hostess who doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose, then you place your order, then you're directed to a table. Someone brings you your order. And they ask you what else you need. But see, you already have just about everything you need because you got your own drinks already-- just like at McDonalds. So you say \"fine, everything's fine\" and they smile and leave. But then you notice there's no ketchup. So you have to wait for them to come back ask them to give you ketchup. But they only bring you a little dentist-cup full, not a bottle. So you have to ask for more. And they make another trip. They're pleasant about it, at least.

There's a line for tipping on the receipt. I really don't know why. All the pleasantness, I suppose.

I suppose you could go to Hopdoddy if that's what you want to do. I didn't feel threatened or anything."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best burger bars that I have ever eaten. I had the Primetime burger with Texas Akaushi Beef and a Might Mule. A must have is the Parmesan Truffle Fries with Aioli sauce."}
{"text":"Way overpriced!! We paid 11 dollars for a kids meal which consisted of a tiny slider with small fries and a small drink. Save your money and go to Red Robin if your wanting a good burger would be my suggestion. Also, it's mostly self service with the exception of them bringing your burger. Terrible setup for a restaurant. We won't return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience at Hopdoddy's! The Primetime burger was excellent, and of course the truffle fries were delicious! Great quality ingredients! Chelsea served us at the bar, She was excellent at anticipating our need! Great service and excellent food! This will be my new go-to burger joint!"}
{"text":"I don't usually review places immediately after I visit them but I had to with Hopdoddy. Everything about the place was great. 

I have been looking for a new, really good, burger joint for a while and this is definitely on the top of my list. Their menu is simple yet still has plenty of delicious choices. I ordered the \"Goodnight\" burger with a side of fries, and it was so delicious I immediately wanted another one. The burger was cooked perfectly, every topping and condiment was just the right amount to add to the flavor, but not overpower it, and the bun that held it all together was just as delicious. Every burger is customizable with many options to fine tune its taste to your unique taste buds. Even their fries are delicious, made with kennebec potatoes, which gives them a very unique flavor. Even though I heard these type of fries are referred to as \"hipster fries\", I still find them delicious. ;-)

The overall atmosphere is very modern and laid back, it is definitely a place to visit for lunch, dinner, and even happy hour. They had a great selection of craft beers and yummy looking cocktails. They also make their own soda and their shakes that look amazingly delicious.

I am very happy I came across this place and look forward to many more future check-ins."}
{"text":"After a day of Black Friday shopping decided to take my wife out for a nice lunch and just happened to drive by and decided to give it a try.  First, I prefer table service vs order pay and wait, reminds me of a fast food restaurant and not a great burger joint . . . zero stars.

The Burger once it arrived was out of this world, I had the Primetime . . . three stars.

The Fries were cold and definitely over seasoned, I had the Truffle Fries . . . zero stars.

I really wanted this place to be GREAT . . . but I was left wanting so much more . . . I might be back, but I would need to be in the area . . . not worth a separate trip."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, went during happy hour on a Friday. Service was attentive, burgers were excellent and came super quick. Most burgers were about $6 during happy hour, with a buck or so off for fries and beers. Even regular price was less than expected. Look online so you know what you want to order before getting in front of line."}
{"text":"Had the classic with bacon and cheese, and it was nothing short of amazing. 
I think this has just moved to the top of my list for a burger place.  

The burger was so juicy, many napkins were needed but well worth it.  
Also got the fries which were crispy and perfectly seasoned.   For a lunch a small fry was perfect to share between two people if you don't want a ton to your self. 

I will definitely by back. As I heard the beer is good too."}
{"text":"The review is my opinion.  I don't appreciate someone insulting me in the complements section.  That is not what it is for.  I deleted both posts."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try as we were in the mood for some good burgers!

Location & Aesthetics -- Located just off E. Camelback Road just opposite The Container Store that's off N. 20th St.  It could be a little difficult to miss from the main streets but with a handy GPS you should be fine.  Once in the parking lot, and there's plenty of available parking, you can't miss the restaurant with it's large signage.
There's available seating on the outside and inside, but this time of the year, most folks were seated inside.  I can't remember if I saw misters for the patrons dining outside.  
Restaurant is clean (outside and inside) and well lit indoors.  Noise level was acceptable with music playing at a comfortable decibel level.
There is a central bar area with bar stools and, of course on the periphery of the restaurant, seating all around.  Seating was booth-like and very comfortable with spacious tables.

Service -- Staff are very friendly.  The concept of being seated and ordering is quite unfamiliar to me so I was a bit lost on the customs of the restaurant.  Thankfully staff instructed me what I had to do.  
When you enter, you immediately join the queue to order your food.  Once you're at the front of the queue, staff will either call you up to take your order providing there's an available table.  You give them your order and they'll show you your table.
If there aren't any available tables, then they will let you know and basically, everyone who's waiting for a table (versus folks there for takeaway), has to stand and wait in line (no orders are taken) until a table opens up then the line moves again.  Very interesting concept which I've never experienced before and do like.

Menu -- Lots of available menus at the door when you enter.  The menu was one sheet, both sides, and very easy to understand with lots of descriptions.  We had questions on portion sizes on some items on the menu and staff was exception at helping us decide.

Food -- I had the classic burger with the bacon and cheese (Angus Beef, green leaf lettuce, white onion, tomato, and something called Sassy Sauce).  Sides are extra so we shared a large Kennebec fries, with a sea-salt caramel shake.
Working backwards, the shake was rich, creamy and semi-thick (not too thick that you'll need a vacuum to suck it through the straw) though they will provide you with a plastic spoon in addition to the straw.
The Kennebec fries (in case you don't know is from the medium-to-late-maturing white potato) was fresh, hot, and slightly salted which made it perfectly delicious!
The burger itself was fresh, non-greasy, non-drippy, well seasoned, juicy, tasty, and very flavorful!
With the wide variety of burgers they have on the menu, I will most likely be back to try some of the other options on the menu and do definitely recommend!  I've also heard they serve a mean watermelon mojito so that will be accompanying my next burger order on my return!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to eat here for lunch recently after reading the good reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. When we first arrived, they were giving out samples of the caramel sea salt milkshake, freakin amazing. I would have ordered one but even though I love milkshakes, they don't always love me back. 
I ordered the Greek (lamb) burger; it comes medium rare, which I was fine with. I also wanted to mention that I ordered a gluten free bun, which, by the way, they make in house, very tasty, really quite delicious (not dry and cardboard tasting like Udi's). My friend got the Buffalo Bill (bison) burger and he liked it a lot. We split a large fries, and, although they informed us in advance that that the fries would come out first, I found that a bit odd, but no points off for that, since we ate all of them and they were pretty decent fries. Their sodas are quite unique, by Maine Root; I opted for the Prickly Pear lemonade soda, very sweet. No high fructose corn syrup in these babies! My friend got the Mexicane Cola and he enjoyed it. Overall it was a very good experience and we would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I ordered the el diablo. It wasn't very spicy but tasted ok. My wife ordered the Greek burger with lamb. It had an aftertaste she didn't like. The truffle fires were very good though. Overall it was ok but value for the dollar wasn't what I expected. A nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and a cool concept.  Don't expect the best restaurant service of your life here because it's meant to be a step up from a fast casual restaurant, but that being said the food and beer list a great.  Their truffle fries are top notch.  My favorite burger place in North Scottsdale and one of my top for all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place makes some solid burgers. I ordered the Thunderbird (not your traditional burger) with a lettuce bun and truffle fries. YOU HAVE TO GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES! They also have a delicious diet mexican coke. The only downside to this place is the price- $35 for 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 soft drinks. The \"fast casual\" concept is also a little confusing. ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"Returned to this restaurant after the manager was nice enough to invite me back. My burger was great and the service was excellent!  I had a great time and will go back again!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my husband & we will definitely be returning!!

The setup was a little bit confusing right when you walk in, so we stood around looking at the menu & after a few mins a server came over & told us how it worked. You walk to the counter to place your order, & then they will assign you a table & bring you your food. Would have been good to have signs, or maybe I didnt see them?

I ordered a greek burger (DELICIOUS) & my husband got the primetime. We also got the parm truffle fries & I ordered an oreo milkshake as well (you have to experience everything, right?). Our burgers were cooked to perfection & the fries were fresh & crispy. I seriously felt like I was on a burger commercial because of all the juices dripping as I ate it. My milkshake was good, but I would've like more oreo & less whipped cream taste."}
{"text":"Our server Kirsten was amazing. She was friendly and attentive and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. The food was also good."}
{"text":"The magic shroom burger with some ros√© was the perfect combination! Great burger joint."}
{"text":"First time I've here. I was very impressed with burger.  I got the Impossible burger. I'm not vegan, however heard the burger tasted like real meat. They were spot on. ."}
{"text":"Hopdoddy the restaurant is immediately inviting  and everthing looks clean & new. The stars are for the food. Negatives is the weird 1-2-3 walk through.

  When you first walk in  there is a bar in the middle of the restaurant. A hostess greets you & invites you to order at the counter on the side. After ordering then you walk to an assigned table. When ordering our items sometimes the servers were disorganized despite being friendly. 

A manager helped us decide what burgers to get. I ordered the Good Cause burger that donates a $1 to a non-profit. All the burgers are organic, hormone free can you say hipster? There is a vegan option on the menu that my friend enjoyed with a multi-grain bun and avocado. 
Overall, I enjoyed my burger you are paying for quality  here. But the major standout was the parmesan fries a MUST order here. Next time, i will order their shakes they look like retro american shakes.  

Outside there is a nice patio that you can eat lunch and bring your dog, they even have dog treats.  It will be a nice hangout place in the fall."}
{"text":"5 out of 5!!! Absolutely recommend this restaurant!!  I'm not normally a burger person but this is seriously the best burger I have had.  The bean burger is fantastic, the turkey burger amazing and the mushroom burger unbelievably good. Highly highly recommend this place!! The vibe of the restaurant is as good as the burgers!! I didn't try the milkshakes but they looked yummy!!! The fries... Delicious!! 
Defiantly a must to try!"}
{"text":"This is a good burger spot. Quality of the burgers is comparable to Zin burger but lower in price. The good news is they are expanding in the valley and they plan to open up another location in Chandler in 2018."}
{"text":"I have had great experiences here in the past, today not so much.  Sat at the bar, ordered a beer, burger (medium)and fries.  Burger came out well done but after waiting more than a few minutes for the bartender to come by to ask how everything was I decided to just eat the burger.  She could have cared less when I mentioned it.  Finally with more than half of a burger and an empty beer I had enough.  The bar tender never asked if I wanted another beer or some water. I decided It wasn't going to get any better so Iclosed my tab and left.  Moral of the story don't sit at the bar if the red haired girl is your server."}
{"text":"I have found the best shake ever and it's at HopDoddy! Seriously my favorite now! I'm in love with The fact that they have homemade condiments, real cane sugar sodas, and amazing eats. The service has been wonderful each time we visit and we have been three or four times now! The gluten-free bun is not amazing, but that's a hard one to master. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best burger place I have ever been to, and I've traveled all over the world. Every burger on the menu is crafted with the celebration of your tastebuds in mind! My favorite is the PrimeTime and close second is the El Diablo! They have something for everyone though so bring an appetite and rest assured your expectations will be exceed!"}
{"text":"I definitely felt the vibe of the place. We were welcomed immediately and given a review of how the place runs. A very solid first impression. Unfortunately orders are taken when you walk in at the register. I would have liked a moment to look over the menu at a table as I felt almost rushed. However, the food was delivered promptly and was fantastic. I had the special (we came on a Saturday) and my friend the shroom burger. As it is marketed as a full bar, drink menus at the table would have been ideal. Also, as first timers, the host followed up with us to check how we were doing which was refreshing. Overall a great experience and will absolutely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I concur with most of these reviews! Great food and service.

Shakes are unbelievably GREAT!!!! Get the one with pretzels in it, the classic sweet and salty in a milkshake.

They have turkey, chicken and veggie selections that are actually GOOD!! LOL!!

Got to talking to the server, they had 1,000 applications, hired 100 and trained them 9 days before they opened. So they know about the food and how it is prepared.

Will make it a point to stop by again in the near future!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!  Order at the counter and they bring it out to you.  It is bright with three sides of the building made of glass windows.  There is a fairly large bar you can sit at or a number of booths throughout.  

We ordered the classic cheese burgers - mine with a gluten free bun.  The gfree bun was really good and not the classic Udi's bun I usually find.  We also tried the chili Queso fries.  My friend liked hem better than I did.  I like my friends kind of crispy and a few bites I had were still a little mushy in the middle.

The milkshakes!!  Holy cow these were good.  I tried the Bananas Foster caramel one and my friend tried the malted root beer one.  These were chalk full of calories but so delicious every once in a blue moon.  

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. It is much better when you can pay at the register and not have to wait for a waiter. The waiters leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere, friendly staff, tasty burger. Didn't leave an overwhelming impression, so it was average in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Excellent food, atmosphere was great. Plenty of people working, we got a table right away. Really enjoyed our burgers. I noticed the hostess workers when not seating customers, were cleaning the doors, windows, tables etc. The place was clean and it was priced right. We will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff greeted me outside the entrance and handed me a menu. Ordered iced tea, but had to wait, as they were just brewing it. Burger was average,  but the fries were very good.  I would come here again,  but would not make a special trip here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Craving a burger and went here per my husbands recommendation. It was busy but not overly crowded. I was super happy to read that they support local farms, grind their own meat and bake their own bread! Ordered the Goodnight burger with a bison patty, no cheese, sauce on the side and a small fry. They usually offer gluten free buns but they were out tonight so I went with a lettuce wrap instead.

The bison was so juicy and cooked perfectly, the caffeinated bbq sauce had a delicious kick and the fries were just the right amount of crispy! I was satisfied. Fun atmosphere with upbeat music and a full bar. Highly recommend for a local burger restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hail ceasar was relatively boring.. Dressing was bland. Baby kale salad was really good. Turkey burger was okay... Don't get the gluten free bread! Drinks were good."}
{"text":"Hop Doddy is Hopping!  This is a great place that has a steady line of business - you walk in and the line forms to the left of the bar.  Modern d√©cor and I'll agree with another - slight industrial feel.  They tout all natural ingredients.  If you have never been - then make the visit - its a cool atmosphere.  They use Angus with the lower end choices which you can expect to pay just under $9 for a burger - i.e. for the GOODNIGHT which is an award winner (I've had it a couple times).  A friend of mine has had the Ahi Tuna burger and she was happy with it.  Their website lists all their craft burgers - with the Primetime coming in at $12 list.  Expect some waiting.  Seating is assigned while your in line (when its busy which is usual).  They have a nice chipotle and a honey mustard sauce you can nab at the counter.  You get your own soft drinks.  Have fun."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Super tasty. The set up is a little weird. The way you order when you go in, yet you have a waiter servicing your table. ?? Who cares! You forget about the odd way of ordering when you take your first bite!"}
{"text":"the primetime burger was really good. nice and juicy.  the queso chili sauce for fries was awesome. the ginger lemonade was way to spicy on the ginger side so I watered mine down and it was much better.  only issue is burgers are on the small side."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there today rate almost 4stars! Burger was good but no enough onions and cheese and bacon didn't jump out at me! Fries good better than average. Great comfortable and great service! Malts looked great but didn't try one! Will try again when I return in October !"}
{"text":"Food is great. The burgers are unique and the truffle fries are delicious and good for sharing. I also like their sodas as it's not Coke or Pepsi, they have their own set. Service is usually pretty quick as well which is a bonus. They have a small bar area too with full service if you're looking for a drink or two. 

Only issue I have is the ordering situation. Sometimes I order and pay up front.. sometimes I order up front and someone delivers a check to me. Then in both scenarios someone is also trying to be your server.. can be a little confusing especially when deciding if I need to be tipping or not."}
{"text":"What a GREAT burger experience. The meat is ground right at the restaurant, the sauces are made from scratch.  So many interesting flavors.  The staff was helpful, location is tidy and the seating is comfy. 

I had the classic with bacon and cheese...DELISH!  We ordered an order of fries and truffle fries.  The garlic sauce was amazing.  

The beer selection is phenomenal.  I ordered a Hefeweizen and was NOT disappointed.  Overall a spectacular burger experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a very long time. Interesting topping combinations too! 

I ordered the Good Day I believe. A dollar from this burger is donated to one of Alice Cooper's charity. How could I resist?! Caramelized onions, cheddar, jalape√±o, bbq sauce and a special mayo sauce too. Perfectly cooked to medium and served on a toasted brioche bun. Fries are large enough to share. We ordered them with the queso and green chiles. So good! 

The only thing off putting was the presence of dogs INSIDE the restaurant. The two I saw were well behaved but one was bellied up to the bar seated on a stool! I personally love dogs so it didn't bother me but I wonder how folks with allergies would feel. Hair in your cocktails anyone?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Hailey is the best server ever! So nice and always asking if you need something! Never have I had such amazing service. I'll be back :-)"}
{"text":"The perfect New Year's Eve hangover cure. Fun atmosphere. Great food. Friendly service. One of the best gluten free burgers around."}
{"text":"Just left here. Came to pick up an online order with my work colleague.  Servers were friendly but did not have good organization. You could tell it was very chaotic. The pick up time was for 12:15 pm, but food wasn't ready, so they asked us to sit at the bar.  We were offered water, but got it at the end of waiting...  Then a tall server with nose rings came with our orders to go in two bags. He READ the order out from the receipt correctly and handed them to us.  I checked my bag once I walked out and of course food was missing from the order! Wow, after reading it??? He's like oh sorry! That's what happens when you don't do things yourself..\" Then when he brought the rest of my order, the truffle fries were cold and hard.  Food taste wasn't bad (the burger), but food should be served hot especially if the order was already incorrect.

Wont be back!  Yikes, what a surprise."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Definitely one of my go to spots for burgers. They have such a wide variety of specialty burgers. I love love love the ahi tuna burger. Its made very well. My husband loves spicy food and says the Diablo burger is one of the best in town with regards to spice level. He says that it's extremely well put together, with the perfect amount of spice. We usually get a side of fries as well with the aoli sauce. This place is great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great burger in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe, lots of fun.  Be prepared to stand in line on busy days.  The burger selection is top notch and the local beers on draught are a nice addition.  You wait in line, order, and go to our assigned table.  The line moves as fast as tables can become available.  Fun time."}
{"text":"The person taking our order was ok... But our bar drink orders came out wrong and had to be sent back.  2 people ordered Jack Daniel's on the rocks and one ordered club soda.  The Jack Daniells arrived as Jack and Club Soda. So they were sent back.... It took 3 trips for the wait person to bring just a club soda. 
2 burgers in our order were fine but the 3rd was cold, and so we sent it back.  The replacement burger came out raw.  We asked for the manager and while waiting, we were chatted up by a waiter who blamed everyone else foe the mistake - he seemed to have a nervous need to make sure we werent really pissed.  The manager removed the charge for the 3rd burger. 
For the price and location, I'm unimpressed. 
Photo of raw burger posted."}
{"text":"We were in the area so we decided to try it. Well the burger was cooked perfect but the burgers were just ok. I guess I like the traditional burger not these fufu burger. BUT if your looking for a beer, this is your place. Great IPA beers on tap and love the frozen mugs. (Yes the beers are why it got 3 stars otherwise it would have been 1 star)"}
{"text":"Best burger and fries in the valley . Good happy hour. ( the name of the joint needs help) ."}
{"text":"This was a final pit stop for my hubby and I as we made our way to the airport.  Not much time was spent to research Hopdoddy as it was within the vicinity of a store we made a stop at and based on the restaurant itself having nice curb appeal, we gave it a go.

It's an order at the counter and they assign you to a numbered seat in the indoor or outdoor dining areas type of restaurant.  Each table has a number placed on a stand, so you basically just need to find where your table is at after you pay and get your beverage glasses.

I opted for the bacon cheeseburger which was a total win. My husband tried the mushroom burger(?) and he loved it just as much as I loved my burger.  The burgers were juicy, not too messy and simply cooked perfect and to my liking. We also shared French fries, they were just as amazing and nicely salted. They also offer a variety of house made ketchup.  I wasn't entirely in love with them, but they were still good.

The restaurant itself has a bar in the center and the service was great.  We got checked on during our meal without it being excessive.  There are TVs throughout, so if you're interested in watching what's on the tube versus being on your phone or talking to the company you're with, make note of that.

I travel to Arizona for work every year for Spring Training, so this will definitely be my pit stop as I make my way to the airport.  Now if only they can open a Hopdoddy in San Diego, I'd be SUPER HAPPY."}
{"text":"Surprisingly really good! The ordering system is a bit different. You wait in a line to order your food before you sit down. The employee said that it's the same thing as if you were waiting for a table at any other restaurant except you stand in a line here. We being two adults with no kids ended up snatching up a seat at the bar. I had margarita to start. It was pretty refreshing. It didn't have any added sugar which is important to me. It was lime juice, alcohol, and ice. We ordered the ahi tuna burger, the classic burger, and the truffle fries. All were delicious. We got our burgers on a wheat bun which had grains baked in the top. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"After eating here I will not go any where else for a burger there burgers are amazing cooked to perfection everything is always fresh and hot when they bring it out the meat is full of flavor you can tell it's quality you must try this place you won't regret it try the shroom burger"}
{"text":"I went on opening day, at the new Camelback location. Everyone was upbeat and excited. I had never visited Hopdoddy before, so the ordering concept for me and the other person I was with was a bit overwhelming. But our cashier was right there and was very patient with all our questions! 

I loved the options in the soda machine. They use the healthier option of pure cane sugar over the sweeteners and actual sugar in their drink options. Cream Sods is awesome! I hadn't had it ages and I have always loved it. A delicious healthier option.  

Our fries were hot and delicious. Our burgers were tender and juicy and delicious. 

Servers were attentive and even offered to fill drinks for us, although it is self-serve. Decor and mood was upbeat and urban hipster. I loved it and will go back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been on a search to replace Indulge, which heartbreakingly closed a few months ago and was my favorite burger, shake and fries of all time. Hopdoddy was a really promising replacement potential. I love how serious they are about healthy beef, local food, etc. Exactly what I am looking for. The location is super cool, as is the concept. The staff was 10000% nice and very helpful. Sadly, I just really didn't like the burger. It tasted like an at home burger, heavy on the pepper taste, and just not what I was looking for. The fries were really good though, as was the made from scratch bun. Finally, the shake was trying to be too much. I had them make me just chocolate, no stout. It tasted heavy on something, like cinnamon. This place is great, probably for someone who likes more interesting tastes (my boyfriend LOVED his poblano burger), but not someone like me who just likes a straight up delicious classic cheeseburger, fries and shake. The hunt for a replacement continues. 

The only other thing to mention is that it took about 40 minutes from line to table - hopefully that is just because it is popular as it just opened."}
{"text":"Just finished their Love at First Sting burger, which may be one of the best burgers I have ever had. It was very spicy, but still edible. Halfway through the burger was a little rough due to the additive spice, but still good. Also, got their regular fries. They were great too. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing. But don't waste your time, go somewhere else! Waited in line to order for over 30 minutes to order a burger. The whole time there were 8-10 open tables. After 30 minutes we left to go somewhere where they actually hire a wait staff to take your order. I will never go back again until they change their business model. It's sad that a place with such good food is run so poorly.

Dear HopDoddy, hire a wait staff already you have good food, nice knowing you!"}
{"text":"First  visit....great service and food. What a cool place to eat at. The hostess was very welcoming and walked us through the menu, she knew everything on the menu, which is always helpful. They have a small, yet awesome menu full of creative burger choices along with sides. I will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Full discourse: my favorite cheeseburger is at Houston's, so it is the standard to which I compare any other burger. When I first started eating at Hopdoddy I thought it was really good. I normally get the Goodnight Good Cause along with some truffle fries, green chili queso and a brew. After several months of patronizing the place, I noticed their portions got smaller. I don't know if the crew working there was making things too big, or if they indeed made the portions smaller, but in any case I didn't think that was cool. Personally, I don't find much difference between the truffle fries and regular fries, especially when you're dipping them in queso like I do. They do have a full bar and I like to take advantage of a pre-meal drink snack and opt for a Little Larry with Chambord. I've read many people complain about the concept's seating situation and lately I agree. The issue is that you walk up, place your order AND THEN get assigned a table. This really throws people off because sometimes people walk in and sit wherever they want while the rest of their party goes up to order meanwhile, the staff assigns that seat to someone else and then you have a problem. The employees are usually cheery and the only reason I gave them 3 stars is because the food is average and then shrinking of the burgers isn't cool when they're charging the same, if not more for less."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the black bean burger! The sauce they use with goat cheese is amazing and I have no idea what all is in that burger but it's the best one I've had ever! Also had the parmesan fries, also spectacular.  Staff was all friendly & helpful. Well worth the trip if you don't live right nearby, we don't, and we plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great service. Second time visiting Arizona and we returned to eat here. Young staff but they are very attentive and service is great. Sat at the bar. Matthew was great and answered all of our questions. Food was amazing. Quality ingredients. Good drinks. Will return here the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that makes a good burger but doesn't give you fries with your burger so instead of a 12 dollar meal in turns into 18-20$ and you can get a far better burger at another place with more food. Burgers are good, but not worth not having fries"}
{"text":"Over time this place has got worse. I order the most basic salad from them to go and every single time they mess it up. I don't request any customization to it, just exactly as the menu states. This is now my third time getting it wrong. Won't be ordering from here again. The lettuce quality isn't great anymore and the plastic ware they give bleeds onto your fingers. Glad I've put that in my mouth to eat with."}
{"text":"I seem to forget about Hopdoddy sometimes when I recommend a good burger joint, and I DON'T KNOW WHY!!!

Last night was my first visit to this specific location, but I've been to other ones a few times. It's always busy, and the food is awesome - good portions and good quality. I got sweet potato fries and the El Diablo last night...highly recommend. I've had a bunch of other menu items before, and I can't remember which exactly they all were, but their fries and shakes are also amazing. They have a good selection of alcohol, should you desire some with your delicious meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the setup! The \"GREEK\" burger (lamb burger) was a perfect combination of flavors. We also tried the chili conqueso fries which were super yummy. Definitely try the \"sassy sauce\", it's good with your fries! Just an overall terrific atmosphere! We will definitely be back! Hopdoddy has burgers to crave! Don't forget to try a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait.... my husband and I went after a long day of shopping. There was a huge line so we decided to sit at the bar. Very well priced beer and drinks and the burger was amazing! Also they give a really great military discount! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! The 10$ burger and beer deal are what's going to keep us coming back, otherwise I don't think the prices of the burgers are justified. I ordered the Buffalo bill my husband ordered the prime time, we both thought they tasted great."}
{"text":"Industrial look inside, order at the counter and they'll bring your order to you.  Came when they had happy hour prices 5 bucks for the burger o day 
which was the hog wild I believe, pulled pork on top of the burger, boy oh boy was this great! The same price for the happy hour fries I got the queso with a load of the shoestring fries again great."}
{"text":"This business model doesn't work. The food is okay. You can order drinks from the waitress, but your food order requires standing in line? Is this fast food, or a fine dining spot? I was very underwhelmed. I won't be going back. Stupid concept and sub-par food. Totally lame."}
{"text":"This place could be a little bigger, and definitely needs more seating and a bigger bar area. The food was fantastic, and I'm pretty sure I could eat the chili con queso fries everyday. Well done."}
{"text":"I ordered the Farmers Market, it was the worst salad I have ever eaten. It looks great in the picture, but turned out incredibly salty.  I don't understand this salad. And that salty powdered stuff totally overwhelmed the avocados. 

The description was this: house lettuce, mix seasonal vegetables, fruits and nuts, cheese, house dressing.

I think a handful of those ingredients didn't make it into my salad."}
{"text":"The time has finally come, THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER is here! The burger is plant based but is said to bleed, smell and taste like meat. My husband and I got it and now we feel like we want to order different burgers but substitute for the impossible patty every time!!! It was delicious! It's a different texture but there is so much flavor and you don't feel so heavy after eating it. 

When feeling a little guilty but still craving starch, I will order sweet potato fries but unfortunately never fully be satisfied. Not this time! The sweet potato fries were crispy, lite made perfectly! On top of our delicious meal I love the different ketchups. Seems simple but it's the simple things in life that we appreciate most! 

Also the staff was awesome! Very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I'm a little embarrassed to say I've been 3 times in the last week. The first time my friend and I split the Llano Pablano burger and baby kale salad. AMAZING! 

The second time another friend and I split the Greek lamb burger. It wasn't my favorite. But still pretty tasty. 

Last night I went with my boyfriend and I got the seared ahi burger. It was so good I literally woke up thinking about it this morning ha. 

Make sure you also get or split the Parmesan truffle fries. To. Die. For. 

Moscow mules are awesome. Friendly staff (Love Milan) and fairly quick. I will definitely be returning again and probably again!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the valley - hands down (JMHO). Fun and attentive servers. You can't go wrong here. My BF and I have tried most of the burgers on the menu and have had no complaints about any of them.  Well, maybe I've complained about one or two being super messy but, in the end - who doesn't love licking sassy sauce off their fingers (and maybe their arm)?

Personally my favorite burger is the Magic Shroom.  Runner up is the Buffalo Bill, or maybe the Terlingua?  The fries are crispy, not greasy and awesome with a side of green chile queso (*drool*).  Also, the salads - yes this is a burger, fries, and shake place BUT - they make great salads!  Spinach and arugula plus a turkey burger patty is yummy and, to my surprise, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything (burger, fries, shake) when I order it.

The ordering process seems to bother some people but remember these key points...

1) The line moves FAST and the host/hostess will happily explain the process to you if you are confused
2) The servers come around with samples of fries and shakes on a frequent basis
3) The bartender will let you sample beer as you progress in line past the bar but...
4) You don't have to order your first round of drinks as you pass the bar while in line.  The bartender is only asking in case you're thirsty while in line (which you probably are, see #2).  
5) Once you're at your table you'll have a server who will take care of everything for you.  Drinks?  Refills?  Sauces?  Shakes?  Yes, the server will handle all of that.

Seriously, if you haven't been - TRY IT!"}
{"text":"this place was yummy! the MAGIC SHROOM burger is a must-have. also the french fries were unreal!!! Happy Hour ends at 6:30 M-F so get there early! service wasnt the best though -- we were routinely welcomed by the same person before we were seated and drinks took way too long"}
{"text":"I have been coming here very frequently since I moved here about a year ago. Their commitment to recycling and composting is so admirable!! 
But, the food... Their burger selection is unlike any menu I've seen before, I've tried something new every time I've come here and have never been disappointed
The fries are seasoned to perfection, and are even better dipped in ranch!

But the best part of this trip was our outstanding service by Bergen, she was very patient and kind with all of the guests in line. When it was our turn, she answered all of our questions thoroughly and even made some excellent suggestions. She is really a great part of an already outstanding team!"}
{"text":"I *love* Hopdoddy! This is an adorable, laid back place with delicious food. (More on that in a moment!) 

The setup is simple. You pony up to a single line, (while conveniently standing next to the bar), place your order and mozy out to a table that's been held for you. Family friendly yet not overwhelming. Booths abound (seating about 4ppl). Tables in the center of the restaurant can accommodate larger groups. The bar is also a great place to sit and graze.

Tip: If there's a line sit at the bar!

Happy Hour is M-Th. (2-6pm)
And(!) the Doddy Deal is $9.95: 
-Classic Burger w/Cheese
-Kennebeck Fries
+ a soda (Coke or Root Beer)

No wonder there's a line to the door!

Now, for the food. There are tuna burgers in the world, and then there is the Ahi Tuna Burger at Hopdoddy. Sweet heavenly geezus, You. Must. Eat. This.

Let me repeat: Ahi Tuna. GET IT!

Por quoi?
Pan seared with a robust area of pinkness. I've had the delight of biting into this burger twice. Typing this I crave it again. (It's *that* good.) Sprouts, teriyaki, honey wasabi, pickled ginger and mayo are best friends with nori chips. The crunch reminded me of stuffing potato chips into sandwiches as a child. Sushi is on par with a top of the line sushi joint. (Yeah, seriously.)

When the truffle fries came out I reached greedily for them. (My friend was not as much in love. When she said truffle fries are a competitive market I thought, \"GOOD. More for me. Now move your hand.\")

Jesse, our bartender, was filled with stories. Katy, a server in the dining area, is a hoot. People working at Hopdoddy enjoy what they're doing and the good vibes make the time pass.

Feel free to buy me a gift card online. You know I'll use it!"}
{"text":"Good food- bad service.
We are continually frustrated by the leaderless staff. They are slow and the staff seems preoccupied with entertaining each other.
Please hire some customer friendly staff versus a fraternity."}
{"text":"After a quick look at the hopdoddy.com, I am reminded of what the name means, but I again forget because today's special has snagged my eye:

THE THUNDERBIRD All-Natural Chicken Patty made with Green Chiles & Cilantro Pesto, Free Range Farm Egg, Tillamook Pepper Jack, Salsa Verde, Pico de Gallo, Crisp Tortilla Strips, Shredded Lettuce, Chipotle Mayo, on an Egg Bun.

Chicken burgers patties go well with beer too!! (Hint as to what the name means. I did get\"hop\" part, down!) 

The burgers here are tasty. The beer on tap is \"handcrafted, small batch\" and served in a chilled big daddy goblet. The service is spunky, if not always speedy. 

I'm not sure how I found out about Hopdoddy - could have been Doug T. or Mark S. or Ed. D., but I definitely had seen someone check-in and thought, \"looks good!\" 

Burger and the way they combine ingredients- 4 stars (I think they should be a bit more meat but taste-wise, they're good though I'm only just working on my \"burger dork\" status ;) Shout out to burger dork! So far: like the \"Goodnight\" but \"El Diablo\" is a close second. You can also BYOB (build your own)

Beers - Five stars - very nice selection of AZ beers - here is where I first found Flag's \"Mother Road's Lost Highway\" 

Bar service - Five stars - Kudos to Daniella and the other doll serving us on Sunday night - they were so busy, but took the time to chat and not neglect our group! Great service and so much fun.

Regular service - Three and a half stars - We've had a couple of outstanding servers at tables and one time, not so stellar - quite neglected

Fries - four stars - tasty! (though portioning is a problem - one time, received hardly any. Other times, it was a normal to generous amount on the $2.75 regular)

Shakes - three stars - Salted caramel is \"good\" but I've also tried nutella and the white chocolate one and I'm not a huge fan but the straws are fun!

Other bevs: cool variety of real sugar soda plus mixed drinks and that \"skinny dip\" is sweet (literally!) Their marg mix is too sweet for my taste buds but cool idea.

Seating - Two stars - A host/ess greets, gives you a menu and reserves a table for you, while you wait in line to place your order. Food is delivered and table service ensues though you can go back up for your own condiments or load up prior to sitting down. Seems awkward. Plus, when we ordered additional from table server is when we got gyped on the fries. Seemed to take longer as well. Just not a fan of it.

Overall vibe - five stars - such a fun and friendly place; the indoor space is bright and open and the outdoor patio is welcoming. \"Awesome job!\" to hiring manager - most workers seem genuinely pleasant and very motivated to keep up on the busy days."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the concept and the food is just OK. They charge sit down prices when it's not exactly full service... it's a bizarre set up in my opinion. I had the tuna burger which included an over-seasoned nori chip (VERY strong wasabi flavor) which kind of ruined the burger. I took it off and then it had nearly no flavor. I'll give it another shot sometime, maybe the tuna burger was a poor choice on my end."}
{"text":"I always bring friends and family here, it is a real crowd pleaser. I love the option for a gluten free bun. The truffle fries are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The experience starts in line where friendly staff greats you, answers any questions you may have so when you get to the counter you are ready to order, oh and they reserve a table so that when your done ordering seats are awaiting. They serve beer in giant frozen glass goblets and they do have a bar, but it seems to be more of a family atmosphere! I don't think I have had a better hamburger. Their BEEF comes from traditionally raised cows with no growth hormones and they apparently buy local when available ....and did I say it is super clean.  It is expensive, which I why I gave it 4 stars, but all in all for what you get its a great place.

It is a first come first serve, so keep your party small (4) or you will get separated."}
{"text":"Second try at Hopdoddy's......All I can say is WOW....ate with my daughter and grand daughter.....Best Burger....Fresh Buns.....and loved (again) the green chili queso fries that they bring out before the burgers are ready....like an appetizer....awesome. 

Highly recommend for burger lovers everywhere..."}
{"text":"I admire the gluten friendliness, I really do. However, the no gluten bun was a big fluff-ball that disintegrated the moment I picked it up. Not exactly a Celiac's dream. GF people long for a burger on an actual bun that can be easily consumed (without a fork and knife). Little pricy for sure and definitely not family friendly. Still tasty though."}
{"text":"I went to Hopdoddy yesterday with a few friends. I was excited to try this place since it is associated with the Salty Sow, which is fairly delish. Also, I had a coupon, so I was excited about that as well. I got to the restaurant later than my friends, so they told me to just sit at the table and they would come take my order instead of having me order at the counter. All of the employees were friendly and accommodating. I ordered a goodnight burger, sassy sauce on the side (sassy sauce is like a mayo, horseradish, and mustard concoction) with a fried egg on top and a pretzel nutella shake.... so pretty healthy. The shake was awesome. I don't typically like or order shakes, but this one was a good mix of salty and sweet. I only drank half and brought the other half home for later enjoyment. The burger was good, but super messy. It had a mess of onions, bbq sauce, cheese, and egg on it.... things were falling out all over the place. This place could use more sturdy buns for their more messy burgers. Anyway, the flavor was good and overall I enjoyed it. Also, the price was right at only 7$ for the burger and 1$ for the egg (wow, way less than expected), 5.50 for the shake (but worth every penny....). I would come back if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My hubby and I both enjoyed a Bacon Cheeseburger with massive fries.  I love their array of dipping sauces-you can change it up.  You can walk up and order or they offer table service.  Great selection of artisan like sodas."}
{"text":"The most Delicious burgers I have had. Awesome spot and location. A bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for. You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"The set up is extremely confusing. You walk in the door and nobody is there to greet you. After awkwardly standing around for 5mins, someone came up and advised up to order in the back of the restaurant. 
*Have a greeter posted at the front to greet customers at entrance. 

They did not have sweet potato fries. 
*What kind of urban contemporary restaurant doesn't have sweet potato fries??!"}
{"text":"This is such an usual place. They have servers yet still make you order from the front and then have a seat. The service was OK, so I have no idea why they have servers if they make you get your own drinks. The only thing they did was bring us our food, similar to how they McDonald's employee brings you your food at the counter. The food however was a very poor quantity for the cost. You're not able to customize your burger all that much and if you do they'll charge you for every little bit that you change. If you're looking for a better burger in town check out steak and shake."}
{"text":"Really unique take on burgers here!  Different ingredients for setting up your burger to your tastes and everything was fresh.  Had a large watermelon ale to wash down my delicious burger and my wife had a yummy milkshake to go with hers.  Was very disappointed with the service however after getting seated.  Had to ask two different people about my wife's milkshake before it was finally brought out.  Im sure it was just our situation but still unhappy about it.  Overall, the food was great and people were friendly.  Nice dining atmosphere and plenty of parking outside.  Didn't have to wait long to get a table because we went for a late lunch.  Would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Not just your average burger joint. With Angus beef organically grown and fresh ingredients there's nothing to feel guilty about except that you didn't come here sooner. This is a trendy unique little place in a shopping plaza. The glass architecture allows for a brightly lit dining experience

Upon arrival you're asked to take a menu and you are seated. When you are ready to order just walk up to the counter and place your order. I ordered the El Diablo burger. They asked me if I was ok with a small ribbon of pink in the middle. I was good with it. Most places don't ask.

My burger and fries were out in a reasonable amount of time. My burger was cooked exactly as they said it would be. It came with lettuce, caramelized onions, tomato, habanero and serrano peppers, and a spicy mayo sauce. All this was piled on to a slightly toasted bun. For all the spice it didn't take away from the flavor of the burger.
The fries are made from honest to goodness potatoes, not the frozen processed ones. They still had skin on the tips. Slightly over cooked, but still good.

This was a good dining experience and I will be back when I'm in the area. My only regret is that I didn't try one of their signature milk shakes."}
{"text":"Love this place! The fries are incredible and I want to drink the queso dipping sauces!! This restaurant is a great addition to the Scottsdale restaurant market!"}
{"text":"Burgers were fantastic. It smelled like fresh baked bread when we walked in. Good selection of craft beers and great service. What more can you ask for?  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great! The burgers are so fresh and flavorful. They bake their own bread and buns which adds to the freshness of burgers. They have many menu options and they are all very creative. The portion size is a bit smaller but they have sides that you can choose from. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I toyed around with giving this place 5 stars. They food was excellent. I got a burger and Parmesan truffle fries. I absolutely loved them. Burger was juicy and the fries were like crack (not that I have a clue what crack is like). The only issue I have with the place is with the operational setup they have for ordering/paying. You place your order and are assigned a table with a server. Not sure what exactly the server does for you other than bring you your check (condiments and drinks are handled by the customer).
I will most definitely be returning. I have to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"There have been an abundance of new burger and beer bars that have popped up recently in the valley.  Hopdoddy is riding that trend, along with filling a burger gap  in the Scottsdale-Shea area after the closure of Indulge Burger.  

The concept here is simple: walk in and get greeted by hostess, read menu,  stand in line, (order drink as you pass the bar if you want), order burger, be seated, receive burger.  

QUICK TIP:  If you sit at the bar you don't have to wait in line! 

I rather enjoyed my vegetarian sandwich and I'm not even a vegetarian ;)  The La Bandita (Black Bean-Corn Patty, Avocado, Goat Cheese, Arugula, Cilantro Pesto, Chipotle Mayo on Whole Wheat) was quite de-lish.  

Sides do NOT come with the burgers.  The fries baskets are very \"splitable\" and are crispy and savory.  Waitresses/bartenders provide regular ketchup and house-special chipotle ketchup.  

Also, there are several beers on tap including a few fun seasonal options.  

Great vibe, tasty food, and a friendly staff at fair prices.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was instantly confused; we ordered our food at the kitchen counter, paid, then sat down at our designated table. Then, our waiter came by and we ordered our drinks separately and paid another bill. Besides it being a confusing set-up, the food was good and the service was very friendly. The truffle fries were worth trying! I got the turkey burger and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time. I really didn't like the Cesar salad at all. There was this weird tasting chicken patty thing that not only tasted bad, but I needed to pay extra for. My husband loved his burger and the Parmesan fries were probably the best thing at our table."}
{"text":"This burger place just might be our new favorite. Delicious food and great service are the keys to our hearts. Paul and Matt made our experience fabulous. Everyone was most helpful. Yummy sauces and healthy fare never frozen but made on site. Try it!"}
{"text":"Came here on Superbowl Sunday for cocktails before heading to a Superbowl party and had a blast! Service is awesome. The girl behind the bar was happy, upbeat, and nice. We did not eat here (since we had to save our appetites for the party) but looking around at all the food made our mouths salivate. We can't wait to come back and indulge on a couple burgers! The cocktails here were awesome. We are very excited to become regular customers of this place!"}
{"text":"Great experience as always. Sat at the bar and had quick service. Ordered food and our fries came out no later than two minutes. I had the Greek burger as usual, although I really regret not getting the good korma burger! Love this place and wish I would eat there more often."}
{"text":"Delicious as always! We usually get the buffalo bill but decided to switch it up with the thunderbird and the primetime and both were amazing. The manager Mike was extremely friendly and took very good care of us."}
{"text":"The food is great! Amazing!!! I love it. The problem is the service. The past 2 times we have gone, our servers were borderline terrible. We had to refill our own drinks, which is fine, but that leaves very little need for servers."}
{"text":"We had a mixed experience at this restaurant.  You have to stand in a line to order your food and then they tell you what table to sit at. It's the place to go if you want a fast food feel with high quality ingredients, but without the fast food checkout. 

We were expecting to be wowed by the chocolate shake, but found it to be a big squeeze of Hershey's syrup and vanilla soft serve ice cream. It was on the soupy side and overly sweet. The Parmesan truffle fries had a great seasoning, but were brown and either soggy or overly cooked. 

I had the magic shroom, ordered medium-rare. It was cooked to perfection and everything about it was exactly what I was hoping for. My boyfriend and daughter had classic burgers. The bottom bun was mushy and all the juices soaked through, causing it to leak everywhere. They ordered their burgers medium-well and it was closer to medium-rare. My daughter also said that she felt the tomato tasted sour.

People that want the experience of walking up to a counter to order something, should try this, but be prepared to calculate the tip before you leave. They don't tell you your total until you've finished eating. The next time we're in Scottsdale, we'll be going to Lucky's."}
{"text":"Best service ever! 
It was our first time coming here and we were greeted so warmly and with open arms. 
We were told the whole process of how to order and even got to choose where we wanted to sit on a Saturday dinner rush. :) (they were busy but still let us graciously choose) 
Then the person at the counter was very knowledgeable about her burgers and helped me choose the BEST BURGER I HONESTLY HAVE EVER TRIED!!! Which was the buffalo bill! So delicious! A must try! 
They had a great beer selection and wait staff! Definitely deserving of the five star rating!"}
{"text":"Great beer, amazing burgers! My sister and I visited here for the first time, I got the classic burger with caramelized onions and she got \"The impossible\" burger made out of veggie both burgers were great! We'll definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear. The food is excellent but the staff doesn't care about being prepared (dirty tables, no ice tea brewed an hour after opening, missed orders, everyone at table getting served at different times 10+ minutes apart) I won't be back to this location.   I'm not sure how this place runs so smooth in Austin and completely sucks in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Great spot if you want to wait forever to eat. Or if being ignored by your waiter is what you're looking for. There are excellent hamburgers to be had all over Scottsdale. Do yourself a favor and head elsewhere if you want to eat at a restaurant that respects your time and money."}
{"text":"If you like Burger Lounge in CA, you'll like this place just as much. The buns are nice and light, and get out of the way of the meat, which is perfectly seasoned, clean tasting, and delicious. All of this without being too oily or dripping in butter (Zin Burger was too evil for us).

The patties are twice as thick as Burger Lounge's as a note.

We also had the Ginger Lemonade and Chili con Queso fries - both were great.

This seems to be the place for clean, fresh, high-quality burgers that don't bore."}
{"text":"Of all the burger joints in all the world...this one just has to be on my side of town, tempting me with it's perfectly-designed burgers, expertly seasoned parmesan truffle fries, and huge goblets of local brews and other favorite beverages. The setup is a little different from other burger restaurants in that you wind your way through the line and pay before getting a table. When it's busy (weekends for sure), the wait can be a little long (30 mins max so far), but they will serve your drink as you wait and usually have water available as well. A good way to get your food fast is to sit at the bar. Of course this means an extra tip for the bartender, but totally worth it for the quick service. 

I have tried the llano poblano, the el diablo, and the thunderbird (chicken) burgers. By far, my favorite was (surprisingly) the thunderbird. Best chicken burger I have ever had. The tastes and flavors are amazing. Just writing this review makes me crave another burger. One thing to note: if you order sparkling water from the bar, you will be charged and given bottled water; from the register it's free. Overall, a strong contender for my award for best burger & fries in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have returned twice since my first review, and feel like I got a false first impression. Both servers I've had since, have been no help, and actually didn't even talk to me to see what I may need until after my food arrived. Bad service has really killed this place. 
Burger is pretty greasy/ messy, but tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing burgers. I've had both the grass fed beef and the regular angus beef. Both do NOT disappoint. I am a creature of habit. When I find something I love, I stick with it and the Llano Poblano Burger is bomb. The french fries are fresh and tasty. I love to wash it all down with a Lumberyard Hefeweizen. Perfect combo. Staff is friendly and fun. I don't normally like sitting at the bar but the seats are comfy and you're closer to the alcohol and ample room to eat, so why not? They also have veg, lamb, turkey and bison burgers. You gotta try this place. Cross streets are Shea Blvd and Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Walking through the door you can smell the freshness of a bakery. We were in line during their lunch rush and Kristen informed us that the bar offered full service. She was charming and welcoming and attentive to us the entire time. Also she picked up on cues and was super proactive -- I was sharing a shake with my sister and she went ahead and split it into two cups, it was a small gesture that went a long way. Thank you Kristen you are the best! Also the food was All Of The Things!"}
{"text":"Its my most favorite burger place ever! Its super yummy! On a tiny bit expensive side! But totally worth it! I can eat here all day long every damn day!"}
{"text":"The soda machine is awesome great flavors ... The hamburger was overcooked not bad but over cooked I was told medium rare it came out medium... Flavors aren't bad on the burger but overall it's just mediocre .."}
{"text":"This is a very cool spot and the food is awesome too. They must be \"line out the door busy\" at times (thankfully today wasn't one of those days) because they had misters and lemon-water for people waiting outside. It's a unique concept that you get assigned a table before ordering your food...so you order your food then come back and sit at your table. then a server brings your food out. 

I ordered the El Diablo burger which was really good and fulfilling with fries. Had a spicy kick to it (didn't really like the onions tho). The only thing i was confused on was are you suppose to tip the workers that are walking around assisting guests? they bring you w/e you need and even refill your drink for you. the sodas are cool too, they aren't your normal coke or pepsi, it's like mexican cola or sugar cane ginger ale, something different.

I will def try the place again...one Con of this place is that it's very pricey! A burger, drink, and fries will set you back $15!"}
{"text":"You guys have done a good job in the past but for the last 5 or 6 times I have come in there you either severely undercooked or overcooked the hamburgers. You guys call yourself a burger bar and that is your specialty. You need to get cooks and or management that know how to cook a hamburger properly. I hope somebody actually reads these and will get back to me from the restaurant or corporate office. Just at a loss as to how you guys mess up Burgers all the time and that's all you do."}
{"text":"I do not have enough good things to say about this place...we just happened to be on the yelp app while in the area, looking for something delicious to try. We found it! I had the Ahi Tuna Burger no sprouts and add avocado. It was insanely delicious, I had teriyaki sauce everywhere, I even got my hair stuck to my face with it, it was really attractive, let me tell you. I also had the Kennebec Fries with Chipotle ketchup! They were very crisp and great! Then I had the shake of the day which was Singh Farms Spiced Honey and Graham Cracker shake, I almost died from the overload of deliciousness, if I could drink that shake everyday I would! My friend had the Goodnight burger but I didn't try any.

We were both very pleased that they served local beers while also sourcing products from local vendors, like the Singh Farms Honey. They also said that they make all their own bread, so that's pretty cool! I definitely recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"Grass fed beef, cinnamon roll shake. My new fav burger place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the El Diablo and the Thunderbird burger. The frys are great as well. Can't go wrong with this place. Thanks for your service."}
{"text":"What a terrible restaurant concept. A mix of fast casual and regular sit down? I am not going to tip anyone when I have to order at a counter and get my own drink. All the server did was bring me the bill. The food was just ok. I was told the burger would be medium to medium well but i felt that the burger was much more under done than that."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite burgers back home in CO so when we learned it was near us here we were pleasantly surprised. Grass-fed beef and plenty of options and always coming up with different specials to try out, this is a family favorite. Try the Nutella-Pretzel shake, it is nearly life-changing. They also have natural cane sugar sodas out of the soda fountains. A lot of people think a burger is a burger, but that's not what you get with Hopdoddy."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and the food once again was terrific. This may only be me but the only downside I would say is it might be best to know the menu before you go in. You are greeted by a host at the door, handed a menu and once you walk you are greeted by a another host who hands you a number for the table you will sit at and then you approach the counter to order. It may seem efficient but with people behind you waiting you can feel a little rushed and the menu is quite extensive, front and back. After this last visit we asked for a menu to read it better and realized there are 2 types of fries! I was just ordering fries and the staff that takes your order never asked which ones I wanted. Next time I will have my order ready to go before I walk in the door."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in Scottsdale! It's so consistent! We get the truffle fries, bison burger and a jalapeno style burger. There are different styles and gourmet options! Affordable and lively atmosphere! Great for sidling up to the bar (Owen helped us today and was awesome and great service!) xo this place."}
{"text":"Really yummy food!
Magic shroom burger has a pesto mayo that adds an out of this world taste combo.
I also had truffle fries and a doble fima margarita. Which were both soo good.
All service was fast and friendly. This place is in the details: creative flavor combos, water with lemon and cucumbers if you're waiting outside, order drinks while you wait on line, big into local meat, recycling, fresh house made ingredients.., the list goes on.
We shared a Carmel and sea salt shake after dinner.. Swoon! Delicious!

The only thing is.. After waiting in line to order.. For 30 minutes! And observing how it's ran: order at the counter, wait for number of table from hostess, wait for food, meet a server that is waiting on you but you are not sure why they didn't take your order... The structure is confusing!! I  am not confident even the awesome food will bring me back because I just don't want to wait in line that long cafeteria style to order. The place is packed with a dinner rush amount of employees - just do table service this would get 5 stars from me and others! The atmosphere and menu set it apart, but the confusing customer structure just sucks."}
{"text":"First time here- Fantastic black bean burger! Completely fresh/ house made...not your run of the mill frozen patty. Strongly recommend the truffle fries and the queso fries. Our table if 4 got orders to share... service was fast and friendly! Overall great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The FOOD is FANTASTIC! The EXPERIENCE was AWKWARD and made us really uncomfortable and feel a bit stupid. This place would be great if they changed the system to typical restaurant service and people could choose to sit outside or not. When first entered we saw a sign that seemed to instruct us to grab a cold one at the bar then order food and then be assigned a table. We waited for the bartender to serve us a bar but then he said if we order from him we will have to pay at bar then again for our food. If wanted to pay all together, we should order beers when we order food. But then he served us the beers and told us to tell them at register. Meanwhile while we were waiting to order beer, a lot of people passed us up and got to order before us. Then we get to the register and were told we will have to wait to order until a table becomes available. It felt weird and awkward to stand there holding a giant beer with wait staff buzzing back and forth. We felt like we were in their way. Meanwhile I am watching the kitchen and noticed who I think may have been the manager with a long beard shuffling food, filling fries, etc with his big ass beard 2 inches from food. EWWWWWWW! and I am a fan of a big beards...just not hovering over my food. We ordered and then my BFpulled out a card to pay and was told you will receive a bill at the table. Again that stupid awkward feeling. Then we walk over to sit at our assigned table but the path was filled with severs standing around because we went to the right of the register which turned about to be the servers bar station. Awkward again!!  Then I wished we could have had the option to sit outside. Had to get our own water. Our food took forever--  which is weird --  because you feel like you are ordering fast food style.  Staff was friendly so that helped a lot, but then they have to \"auction\" your food since they didn't take the order. And to top it all off, my burger came with tomato when I asked for no tomato. Good thing it's just because I don't like it and not allergic. Our bill for two burgers, small fries to share and 2 Papago Orange Blossoms was about $40. The super awkward experience made us not want to tip the usual 20%. And why should we when the only thing a server did was bring food to the table once? But damn,  that was a really really good BISON Burger and I would go back again now that I know the system. I would like to try the Biltmore location and hope they have a better ordering and seating system."}
{"text":"OK, so if you love burgers and more so enjoy organic beef, Hopdoddy Burger Bar in Scottsdale is certainly the place to go.

First, let's talk about the restaurant setting itself.

The building is done nicely in a modern/industrial look with SW touches inside and out.

You are immediately greeted by a server who will issue you a ticket with a number for you table and then will mark it reserved while you stand in line to order your food and drink.

The line moves pretty quickly, but you have to wait until you are near the registers to read the menu board (if you do not have great eye sight like me). Since you will be passing along the back side of the bar, this is the time to check out what is on tap for beers.

Once you have ordered, you simply go to your table and wait for everything to be brought out (which the did quite quickly considering that place was nearly full).

We ordered a large side of fries that came first and was perfect for 2 to snack on (and quite tasty).

Then the burgers came and I was pleasantly surprised not only in how well they looked but also by how great they tasted.

Unlike many gourmet burger joints (including those that serve organic or grass fed beef), Hododdy does not smother the burger in sauces so you can not taste the meat.

Also it was cooked perfectly to a nice medium rare (seared outside so inside was nice and pink but warm), juicy but not to the point of being messy (meat also seemed quite lean) and tasted great.

Will certainly look to eat here more often since it is only a short distance from home ... and a good opportunity to try other local brews they have on tap (tried the house IPA which as pretty good)."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful example of a concept from Austin and shows there is room for more great restaurants that serve burgers (sorry sam fox). For some reason town & country not as good :/"}
{"text":"I do not eat red meat but love me a delicious Turkey Burger!! I wanted something different and I got the prim time burger with the turkey patty. 

Hands down the best Turkey Burger I have ever had!! I loved every juicy bite!
They also have great milk shakes.
I got the Parmesan truffle fries, Just as Good. 

The service was great and every thing looked as it was moving smoothly due to the fact they just opened. 

The concept of ordering is kind of difficult when you have little ones so next time I will send my husband to order and ask to get seated sooner then later. 

Very excited I tried the burger place looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"yummy.  definitely the best burger I've ever had.  Wish they had a better selection for kids since I brought my young grandson on one visit."}
{"text":"Updated after second visit. We both ordered the same burger (the one with a poblano chile on it), shared an order of truffle fries, he had an IPA and I had an iced tea. I removed one star from my previous review, as we both were sick within the hour. I did email to let them know and someone called a few days later to say they temperature check the line several times a day and no one else called in sick. (Most patrons don't, but that doesn't mean it wasn't attributable to the burgers we had there).  It doesn't matter which element was to blame, though meat temperature is the most likely culprit. My appetite for HopDoddy is not likely to return."}
{"text":"Full Service? Not really.  Assigned Seating? Yes.  Fast Food style line? Yes.  Tipping? Yes - jar with a reminder phrase about how tipping isn't just for cows.  Also the credit card slips have the tip line on them, but yet again this is clearly not a full service place.  Interesting.

The awkwardness started when we couldn't enter the building yet there were many open tables visible, and no apparent overcrowding inside.  They have a corral that starts outside with staff only allowing patrons in to where you find yourself paying for the 1st of multiple times - the first is a separate transaction in a standing line for your beer.  And sadly there are only Arizona beers on draft and the large size is only available in a big FROZEN schooner that you often see at old school Mexican restaurants.  After paying for the first time you continue through the line where another staff member gives you an assignment slip for your table.  Better not lose that!  And then you order at the register, pay a 2nd time, and proceed to find your assigned seat.  In my case it was 2 burgers, 2 fries for low $30's (excluding tip and excluding beer).  Shortly after this I found my beer glass empty and guess what - you must go back to the bar or find a roaming employee in your assigned seating area.  So make that a 3rd transaction for my visit.  I'm not making this stuff up.

When I thought it couldn't get much worse before I had even received my food I made the mistake of getting a nice tall glass of water from the unlabeled water dispenser which turned out to have cucumber and citrus juices in it too.  If you don't dig cucumbers, you understand the surprise.  But to make me feel better, I noticed all of the signs espousing the \"support local\" philosophy/religion and such, and for that reason I can see why they'll gain a lot of similarly minded consumers.   

Food quality was in fact fairly good as far as burgers go and reminded me a lot of Smashburger, but then the inevitable comparisons of how they run the business came to mind.  

In the end I find myself leaning in one of two separate directions. If I'm going to dish out this much money for burgers and beers I'd rather just be at a full service place.  Or, if I'm going to be corralled into standing lines and such then maybe I'd rather just be at a Smashburger-like place where the food is just as good but without the big dent in my wallet."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and had a buffalo burger. It was fantastic, extremely juicy and flavorful. I'd also recommend the truffle fries, they were great as well."}
{"text":"First, I will qualify this review with the fact that we have a couple of these in Austin. We went there and were not impressed enough to even write a review. The food was OK (better than this experience), but the service was HORRENDOUS! We had a really bad server. So, why did we try this location? One word..location. We were hungry for a beer and burger and this was the closest thing at the time.
So, I tried the lamb burger (labeled GREEK on the menu).TRIED! It was so overcooked and flavorless. If that was really Tzatziki sauce and not just lumpy jarred mayo blessed with a little sour cream, I apologize. There were two small pieces of pickled onion on the whole sandwich. Also, I know I need to remember that I'm back living in my beautiful desert, but does all the meat have to taste like it's just hiked up Camelback?!?!?! SERIOUSLY!
I was torn on whether or not to order fries and wish I didn't. Several reviews have mentioned that they get soggy pretty fast. I thought they would taste better than fast food restaurant fries, but they didn't. The beer I had, which was a seasonal I don't remember, was cold and good! Didn't save the food, but helped. B had the Good Cause burger (good man!) and added bacon. He thought it was OK, but didn't like the BBQ sauce. This shocked me. He would bathe in BBQ sauce. He said it definitely wasn't one of the best burgers. They served his favorite Kiltlifter, so a couple of pints later, the burgers packed in take home boxes, that we knew we probably wouldn't touch again, didn't look so forlorn.
The service was OK, but not spectacular and fun, like at so many other burger bar type places we've been. Football season is coming, and we need to find hangouts here and places to pick up a good burger to watch at home! Probably not going to be Hopdoddy."}
{"text":"Nice burger place, but greasy but expected. Would be easier if make order up front, but able to pay at the end so you can add requests. Their sodas are horrible, we always end up buying bottled coke."}
{"text":"Primetime is always fantastic. Truffle fries are a must. Ceasar sald was great too. Quickly ordered at 6pm on a Friday and got our food in no time."}
{"text":"All right.  The burgers are really good.  Truffle fries - nice touch, Hopdoddy.  I approve.

However, if the bar seating is full, I'm out.  The whole 'Wait in a cafeteria line to order a $12.00 burger a la carte' concept just doesn't jive for me.  It's awkward.

Fortunately, it's a family establishment so there's usually room at the bar...or maybe it's just my drinking schedule..."}
{"text":"I mean, sweet mother of all things holy that pesto/mushroom/goat cheese burger was AMAZING. I would come back 1058486 times just for that. Very similar to a Zinburger, however I think their truffle fries are BETTER (yeah, I feel like a traitor just for saying it haha). A little pricey however worth every dollar in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday and I am hooked.  Sat at the bar which was full service.  First, the bartender we had was great.  Always kept our drinks full.  Had good suggestions on food as well.  The burgers were great.  My girlfriend got the black bean burger and was a fan.  I went for the Buffalo Bill and it was great.  Bison burger cooked perfectly with hot sauce and blue jack cheese.  Also, I definitely recommend the fries with green chili queso.  Burgers were great, but the green chili queso may have been the best part. Ended the meal with a salted caramel shake that was made perfectly."}
{"text":"Wow. 

Sterling service - friendly, efficient, helpful, and so very pleasant. Really really pleasant. 
Menu - great options - loads of beef choices, and some lamb, turkey, chicken, & veg.
Fries - OH MY LAND - so crispy, perfectly seasoned, and delish. Maybe the best fries I've ever had, truly.
Drinks - good beer/bar menu, but we had the ginger lemonade - heavy on the ginger. 
His Burger - LLano Poblano - fresh, flavorful, cooked to perfection, seasoned well, a bit on the spicy side but not over the top. SO yummy. 
Her Burger - Greek Lamb - Raw. Not rare, but Raw. Inedible. Completely inedible. 

My take - I'd return here for all the reasons you'd think. But.... I'd be sure to get my burger cooked through. I'd love to savor some of the flavor of His great burger in a lamb patty. 

Why didn't I return my burger? Too crowded right at high noon, not willing to wait for a redo. Why do I even mention it? So you won't have to.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"This restaurant was shockingly busy for a Wednesday night. because of this, it did take us a while to get our food. the food was good, and I had a nice time. it was nice to try a new restaurant in this area. I would definitely go again. If you go I highly suggest a blueberry soda!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a really tasty burger that filled my senses. I didn't find that here. The patty was bland and the toppings were mediocre. I liked the green Chile queso fries. It has a good vibe, just needs more flavor."}
{"text":"Ordering here was a little tricky - you grab a menu by the exit and order at a counter towards the back of the restaurant. It's not clearly marked where you need to go, but the servers are really helpful if you're not sure about where to go.

Chose to get the Buffalo Bill burger and an order of fries, which came out to be about 15 dollars for a take out order. A little bit pricey, but the burger was really big and the order of fries was too much for just one person at a reasonable price for a higher end burger place. The fries were really good, well seasoned and with good flavor. The Buffalo Bill burger, which was a bison burger, was a little too smoky for my taste, but still enjoyable and worth trying. They have a lot of other interesting sounding burgers on their menu as well, which is what I would want to try the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time, but tonight they were definitely off. When they are slammed quality control goes out the window. The fries were extremely salty. There was about a quarter cup of sassy sauce on my burger, and our burgers were well done. It's a bummer because when they are slower the food is great."}
{"text":"The Burger was great, staff friendly and efficient,  definitely recommend this place as a much check out, you will be back"}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good. I had the ahi tuna burger, my wife had the turkey burger. Both were flawless. We also ordered a large side of fries, which was also awesome. Great beer list, and some pretty interesting craft drinks. My wife had the Moscow Mule. She said it was great. Good stuff----can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite after work spot. My coworkers and I work next door at snooze and always enjoy the food. Today Hannah took care of us and was excellent! She had great energy and interacted with everyone at the table. Thank you hop daddy for always having a great ambiance and excellent service."}
{"text":"Burgers are great.. Not so much the salad. Also there were plenty of seats open inside but they told us they only had outside open ? So we sat outside and now I'm covered in mosquito bites"}
{"text":"Good news/Bad news.
  First:  the truffle fries are almost as good as FEZ fries:)  the Diablo burger is to die for even though it's a little too little for the price.
Second:  the milkshakes are not made with ice cream... they are made from a \"machine\" with some sort of powdered mixes??? that was not made clear.
   the worst part of this first time and last time visit - the staff absolutely would NOT stop bothering me and my party.  At least 4 different people came up over 6 separate times to see
how things were, to pick up plates that were not ready to be picked up, to just chat???, to introduce themselves, to see if the check was ready.  I felt like I was having more conversation with the different staff rather than my friend.  It was very annoying to be interrupted so many
times.  I finally just stopped talking and let my companion field all the comments and questions.
good grief.  They do have out door seating .  We did not go up and stand in line, so a wait person did bring us drinks and food.  So now I know."}
{"text":"We went here because my son said we should try. We were seated promptly but I could see this place gets busy so you may have a wait. I am hard to please with why burger as I want it lettuce wrapped. They did a great job and I was pleased. If I was in the area I would for sure come back. There was 6 people in our party and everyone enjoyed their meal. People came by to see if everything was OK and to refill our drinks. My grandson had been there before and made a friend to one on the waitresses. She stopped by and they talked about action figures. My grandson is 5. He was so excited to see this waitress and get to talk to her. Thank you Hopdoddy for having great people working at your location."}
{"text":"I love this place! And I don't mean that facetiously. This place is the Glenn Close to my Michael Douglas character from Fatal Attraction.

That's actually a bit harsh, but it's because I always have snaccidents here - eating an entire pizza, bag of chips, or another food by mistake. But you can't help it here. Each burger combo strikes with the power of a Zeus thunderbolt! Even the fries are abnormally good. They've got the thin ones to make you have room for your burger, and also make you feel kinda fancy. 

Also, I'm not a big beer guy, more of a cider guy. The drinks are top notch though. Go here once and you will damn  the prohibition movement from back in the day and never wanna be a teetotaler.

Hop on down to this place. It's real good."}
{"text":"Drove by this location watching it being built many times thinking another burger place, do we really need another burger restaurant? Yes since it is close to home and great quality.

Tried going there last Saturday and the line into the restaurant was out the door, so we decided to come back another day. 

Wide selection of burgers including bison which I will try next time, had the Llano Poblano Burger with a fried egg which was prepared well and very juicy with truffle fries which were very good. The true test were my kids thought this was one of the better burgers that they have had.

Location is very accessible with plenty of parking and the ambiance is very nice, with of course a bar, very modern decor and tv monitors that add to the atmosphere but does not make it a sports bar. Plenty of outside seating for the current awesome night dining.

Service was good but the waiter really does not need to do anything as they have a self serve drink dispenser.

Will go back to try the other burgers and encourage anyone to try this new resatauant."}
{"text":"So I've been here about a half dozen times now since it opened. It's still delicious and amazing. It draws a crowd on weekends around dinner, but the hostesses do a great job of moving the line, getting drink orders for people in line, and even sometimes handing out free fry or milkshake samples. Only complaint is that occasionally, after the initial food delivery from my server, they went MIA, even though we stuck around and chatted for an hour or so, making refills and additional orders (shakes) difficult. Granted they were fairly busy, but still a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Magic shroom burger and truffle fries were fantastic!   Great happy hour prices  great service!!!"}
{"text":"This place has some super delicious burgers. They're made with fresh grounded beef, and their truffle fries are to die for!! When I went in, it was my first time & the waitress was super friendly. She was also very quick to get our order in & food out. The atmosphere is fun & flirty. They offer patio seating, bar seating or restaurant style seating. Great place for burgers & as the waitress stated....their serrano chilis are definitely hotter than the habanero. Or they were at the time I ordered my burger."}
{"text":"My absolute most favorite burger place near me so far! The menu is very eccentric and every burger I've tried is great. My favorite is La Bandita last one on the menu. It has 22 different ingredients just in one burger, never had anything like it. Reminds me of a major city restaurant but not as expensive because it's in Arizona. The beer is also stellar, soo much to choose from. And last the fries are addictive, just wish it would come with the meal all together instead of paying separate. Hope everyone goes and try's this great new place!!!!"}
