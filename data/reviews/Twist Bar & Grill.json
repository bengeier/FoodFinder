{"text":"I would give this less than 2 stars but the Cheese Curds were phenomenal!

We were in a private room and a party of 6. Our wait was awful!  We had to leave the room to ask for our waitress. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer. Which arrived 5 minutes before our meals. 

The pasta was excessively salty. The steak ordered medium came rare/medium rare.  The fish tacos were a bit gritty. The mushroom stack and mac & cheese were the only main meals that two of the diners were happy with."}
{"text":"The blackened chicken sandwich is fantastic. Service was fast and great. 5 stars for tonight."}
{"text":"After several dissapointments to begin my stay at the Radisson, ( the pool being closed, the hot tub being out of order, my sleep number bed not working) I was fully expecting the bar to be broken as well. I was pleasantly surprised to find not only was the bar open, but they had my favorite beer on tap, and I'm convinced they have the best bartender in Madison. Scratch that, the world!! Now I am a bit of a celebrity, (Olympic athlete to be exact) but not only did they not make a huge deal about my staying at the hotel, but they acted as though I was just a regular guest. How refreshing!! Like a fresh of breath air!!  A quiet start to the night was quickly turned into the most fun I've had at a hotel bar in a long, long time!! The Wild Mushroom Pasta was simply orgasmic, the beers kept arriving at the exact moment they were needed to quench my undying thirst for adventure, and the bartender really made sure everyone had an amazing time. I look forward to my next visit to Madison, and won't even care about the pool, hot tub, or malfunctioning bed, as long as Chris is behind the bar, Scott is talking about $50,000,and how much he loves nature, Shooter is doing shots of hot Bacardi Limon, and Paul is Paul. I will definitely be telling the rest of my speed skater friends that Twist is where its at!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Friday night, thanks to my coupon from Bucky Book. Spouse had the fish fry and he thought it was one of the best he has had, and we have done a lot of fish fries. It comes with both coleslaw and soup, and a potato choice, for $11.95, which is a really good price for all that food. I had the deconstructed ceasar salad, and it was really good and the presentation was amazing.The drinks were great, had a nice selection. No problems with service either time. We enjoyed it so much, we came back the following Friday after 8pm for just drinks and apps. Did the cheese curds and the fries, and the strawberry shortcake.  Everything was delicious and presented well. Bartender was courteous. We will be coming back for their Thanksgiving buffet."}
{"text":"5 stars for several reasons. Stayed over night with my boys 6,3 years old, waiter was very good with kids. Food came out fast. Fish tacos were amazing. Kids split the Friday fish fry (cod) eat every bite. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay kinda pricey for what you got.  Most of the staff was nice. T he cocktails was good tho."}
{"text":"Placed an order with a delivery service at 8PM. At 8 FORTY, I receive a call saying the bar decided to close early. Absolutely RIDICULOUS, closing over an hour early. Stick to your freaking hours. Now I've got very limited time to find somewhere else to eat. You can be certain I will never try to order from this place again."}
{"text":"I have eaten there twice.  I had the Cuban sandwich with the family.  It had Berkshire ham which is super flavorful and awesome fries.  Homemade I would guess.  My son had the giant burger.  He raved and couldn't even finish it.  My daughter had the seared tuna sandwich and she liked it a lot.  Split some curds which were Carr Valley (Best Wisconsin Curd) and they were gone before I got my share :(   because they rocked.

My other time I had the Mac and cheese.  Huge portion and very good.  Came with some toasted bread and I give it the thumbs up.

The drinks we had were very unique and well thought out.  Decent beer selection for my son.  Bar is large and comfortable.

The restaurant as well is very chic.  Well thought out and laid out.

It's on my \"go to\" list moving forward.   

Good job Twist on bringing a new awesome restaurant to Madtown."}
{"text":"What a pleasant suprise! Two of my colleagues took me to twist for a quick impromptu birthday lunch.  The place was fairly empty and I wasn't expecting to be overwhelmed.... I expected either poor service or poor food given the lack of clientele.

What I recieved was excellent service and really very tasty food.  One of my friends ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich with fries, the other the steak quessidilla with fries.  I got the steak sandwich and salad.  The salad came with a lovely home made strawberry vinaigrette and they happily brought. me horse radish.  the guac with quessidalla tasted homemade and the chicken on the chicken sandwich was moist.  The drinks and cheese curds were even good.  


I'm left wondering why they were so empty.  so... here it is, I'll do my part.  Check this place out!  Great little place for a fast lunch or happy hour pit stop!"}
{"text":"To start positively - the old fashion was good. Now the not so good. We started with the shrimp and crab gazpacho. There were 4 shrimp and no crab AT all. I ordered the steak sandwich which came without the haystack onions and was thin on steak. The roll was really dry. My husband had the wrap with cilantro jalapeño slaw. It was brown with no jalapeños or cilantro and was crazy dry. Bottom line not good and we will not be back."}
{"text":"It was big enough and sports on the tv. But the service was ok at best and the sports were just soccer games. Cool if your into that type of thing. The energy was just way too low to keep me entertained."}
{"text":"Omg. Just had the carrot soup and both my husband, who doesn't even like veggie soups, and i agree that it's amazing. Also best waiter/bartender. The Old fashioned is soooo good"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Madison, I stay at the Radisson and eat at Twist. I stood at the counter for 10-15 minutes while being ignored by 2 staff. I'm extremely upset by this as the restaurant had 1 table of customers,  and I even understand if they are busy preparing for something,  but atleast acknowledge me and let me know you're busy. I'm not sure I will spend any money here in the future which is sad.  I stay for a week at a time and always order from twist because it makes my stay easier."}
{"text":"The food tastes good but the bartender and service is extremely slow.  Try a different place."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings smoked in house. The bleu cheese dressing is phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"Parking? Check
Live Music in the afternoons rather than at bedtime? Check
Good environment? Check
Great happy hour deals? Check

Finally a west side (read non congested downtown venue) which is striving to host regular live music in the jazz, blues, acoustic genre. Get out and support this people!!!!! Thursdays at 4. See you there......"}
{"text":"Twist is new and the chef is putting the twisr on some stand bys i enjoyed the steak sandwhich"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this was!

What local thinking of going to a hotel for nothing else except dinner at their restaurant?  I guess when you're trying to use up the last of the Bucky Book coupons you do!  

We had a $10 off $20 purchase there and stopped in because I had recently attended a conference at the Radisson Hotel and when I saw the restaurant, I recalled the coupon.

I got the portabello sandwich which was thick and tasty with a generous amount of goat cheese.  Fries were crisp and tasty.  Hubby got the egg burger which he declared as the 2nd best in the city with Red Robin (what?!) being his favorite.

The restaurant wasn't busy which likely contributed to the fast service.  The atmosphere was welcoming though the background music seemed just a bit loud for conversation.  I could just be a bit sensitive too.

When I was there for my conference the previous week I noted they have some stuff going on in the restaurant during happy hour including \"Skittles Bingo\" and free beer though I'm certain the beer offer is only for paying hotel guests.

Definitely wouldn't hesitate to come here again."}
{"text":"Steer clear if possible. 

Twist has an okay atmosphere and the portions are generous, but everything else about it was disappointing. It's a confusing cross between a restaurant, sports bar, and hotel lounge with a fairly standard menu of American dishes. 

The food was a major issue. If you're going to serve a Friday Fish Fry in Wisconsin, you should at least have a vague idea about when the fish is overcooked. The hamburgers clearly have been previously frozen and didn't have any pizazz. Our server wasn't terrible but she wasn't really good either. 

Overall, Twist is like a Buffalo Wild Wings without the wings. You can imagine how terrible that would be."}
{"text":"Nice clean classy and great quality food! #yumwings"}
{"text":"Two stars only because the food was good. We went on a Saturday evening around 8 pm. There were a few people at the bar top but other than that not many people. We had a party of 5. The service was the slowest I've ever had at a restaurant. No napkins or silverware. We had to go to the bartender multiple times for napkins and boxes after we asked our server for them. We never once were asked how our food was. Good food, just awful service."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here since the restaurant has been redesigned and I love the new look and feel! We visited on a Friday for their weekly fish fry. My wife and I had the baked cod and it came with a choice of salad or soup, coleslaw, and choice of potato (potato cakes, baked potato, baked sweet potato or french fries). We both had the salad and baked sweet potato and it was delicious as well as the fish. The plate was generously portioned and the price was fair at $11.95. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This has become a go-to for happy hours with the girls after work.  The first few times we came here it was pretty quiet but we've noticed that people are discovering this hidden gem.  The bar is located inside of the Radisson hotel and, from the outside, you wouldn't guess that it housed such a unique, fun establishment.  The bar is huge and was recently remodeled.  It's incredibly inviting.  The bar is long, curved and sleek, with other high top tables within the bar area.  There is also plenty of other seating options, slightly separated from the bar.  

They have a nice amount of TVs and call themselves the Madison soccer headquarters.  Every single time we've been there we've had amazing service.  One bartender in particular (I'm awful with names) has been there the majority of our visits and we are always impressed.  He was the busiest we've seen him last night and he still maintained his cool, friendly self.  He always offers us food menus and makes sure our drinks are filled promptly.  And when he couldn't get to us right away last night, he acknowledged us and promised he'd return.  That, to me, is HUGE.  

They typically have a great little jazz band performing in the back corner which adds a really nice touch to happy hour.  I have all this awesome stuff to say and I haven't even touched on their happy hour prices!!  $3 for a good pour of wine?!!  Yes please!"}
{"text":"My hubby had a conference in the Radisson Monday morning. We got in and checked into our room at 8:30 pm Sunday night...tired after the construction delays on highways and rain slowed us down. After checking yelp and seeing that many of the nearby restaurants closed at 9, we decided to eat at Twist, which closes at 10....after seeing all the posters in the hotel showing what looks like an awesome burger. Just before 9 we, get to the doors....locked...an hour before advertised closing time...no sign of life in the restaurant...who knows when they actually closed for the night. I guess the twist on the sign that says \"American Cuisine with a Wisonsin Twist\" is that they close whenever they feel like it. Ended up eating at Applebee's...ugggh...and then missed getting to use the hotel pool."}
{"text":"You can get in here easily - it shouldn't be that way, because the food is great and the atmosphere is fun. 

The plank salmon is great, sandwiches come out on ciabatta rolls (delish), and my brother demolished his ribeye.  Everything was a winner.

Great place to see a game - comfortable setting, solid service, tasty food.  Prices on sandwiches and apps good.  Entrees are on the high side, but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Before I get started, YES, I know this is a restaurant attached to a hotel. 

Twist wants to be the coolest dude in town and tries to wear its sunglasses at night. On one hand, the decor is actually pretty trendy and nice. LED chandeliers and sharp-angled seating dot the restaurant and add a nice dose of character.

On the other hand, the food is overpriced and somewhat bland. The cheese curds were solid and so was the ginger carrot soup. However, the entree fell flat. I ordered the Mac and cheese only to be pretty disappointed. For $16, it should have been stellar. Instead, it was bland and didn't even come with anything else (hello, where is the bacon at this price point?). 

Finally, the service was actually really good. My waiter was friendly and quite attentive. 

Twist has the potential to break the hotel restaurant quality curve, but it still has work to do."}
{"text":"Heard good things. Got great service but the food was just ok. The fried shrimp had a coating like pancakes?  Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in because of a Bucky Book coupon and wanted to try this \"new restaurant\" (which used to be Bassies, located in Radisson hotel). 

It's very much brighter, more natural light, with a reconstructed seating area. Food arrived super fast, piping hot. We were a party of 2 and both had the half pound burger, which was cooked to order perfectly. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food for a hotel bar/restaurant. But the bartender Paul will make your experience special: he's attentive, remembers your name, and is a total hoot. All while being efficient, making recommendations on food and beverage and sharing great stories."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem! 

It's located inside the Radisson Hotel, but you can't miss it. You enter into a small hotel lobby type area and the bar is the first thing you see. The bar itself is gorgeous! It looks like it has been renovated very recently. Everything - the finishes, the tables, the decor - it was perfect! 

A friend and I chose this place to meet for a drink or two before catching a movie across the street at Market Square.

I arrived at about 3:45, and the bar is actually closed between 2-4pm each day. I had missed this when looking at their website so that was on me. However, I could see folks inside and could hear chatter, so I just decided to walk in and see if they were open. Nope! LOL - it was a staff meeting (sorry for interrupting!). They were so nice though, they allowed me to come in and take a seat at the bar anyway. Awesome customer service!

The bartender was very friendly and the drinks were great. We didn't stay long, we had that movie to catch, but I will absolutely be coming back to this place! I am so glad we decided to give it a try! They also have a full menu of delicious sounding meals, another great reason to stop back! 

I feel like a lot of hotel bars can be very underwhelming, however this place is not like that all! Go check it out!"}
