{"text":"The black bean beef, mixed veggies and Shanghai noodles were all very bland. The only exception was the broccoli in the mixed veggie which was bitter for some reason - shockingly bitter (and funny enough, not all broccoli were bitter but some were). Owners are friendly though so that redeemed it to two star but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Contrary to what seems to be the popular opinion, I really enjoy the food here. I've heard from some friends that it may not be the most authentic but it's still enjoyable, and for the price, you almost can't complain.

I've gotten enough food to last me multiple meals, for only $8.00, on several occasions.

The family that owns the business is fantastically polite and welcoming- especially who I can only assume to be the husband.

My main complaint would be that the environment is not necessarily the cleanest, nor the most orderly. The restaurant is attached to a coffee shop- a Coffee Time to be exact- and that is, on its own, a very strange combination. Its atmosphere is pretty outdated, but if you're doing takeout or delivery, that isn't an issue.

It's a nice little family business that I would more than recommend supporting."}
{"text":"I tried this place out on a whim as its within waking distance from my house. Very good. So we order a few more times and have never had a bad order from there. It looks a little odd as its in the same location as a Coffeetime donut place but they make great food and the owner is always very friendly when we see him."}
