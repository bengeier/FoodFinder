{"text":"I don't have a lot of experience with Haitian cuisine but the food was great. We ordered the chicken with rice and peas. The price was a little expensive for chicken and the service was slow but will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  I've been going here for a few years. I have tried most of the menu and have not been disappointed.  But unfortunately the service is some of the slowest I've ever seen . Thank god the food is good. It's the reason it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Pas de place dans cette petite cuisine créole. 
La nourriture était seche, trop cuite, et un mauvais goût de fumée de cigarette !!! 
On a essayé 2 fois pour voir si le \"chef\" avait eu une mauvaise journée mais .. non !"}
{"text":"La bouffe est super bonne! Le poulet le riz et la sauce sont vraiment sa coche. Petite salle à manger et je trouve le menu un peu trop cher. Par contre la musique et l'ambiance est très sympatique!"}
{"text":"If you need some good haitian fix and friendly service, go to this place!
Finally a great haitian joint that makes tasty griot!! 
The place is a small hole on the wall and they dont have alot of tables(4-5), but sometimes, these little restaurant make great food! 

I didn't give a 5 stars only because the service was a bit slow and the price a bit high. But still worth it!"}
{"text":"Close to authentic Haitian. I love that place. No change since 2008, still as good as it was 8 years ago. Good portions, amazing flavors, you're going to be satisfied.

But you have to be patient. Breathe in, breathe out. Patience is the key. Some people were waiting 20-30 minutes for their order. Luckily we did wait for only 10 minutes.

The ambiance is also great, you almost feel like you would be chilling on the beach.

I'd go back anytime."}
