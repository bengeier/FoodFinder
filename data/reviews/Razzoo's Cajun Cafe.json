{"text":"The food was really good, and damn spicey.  The portions were huge, I don't think I was able to eat even half of it.  This is probably the best cajun place I have been too outside of NOLA."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu. Food here is always good but the service can be kind of hit or miss. They had one waitress named Jamie that was probably responsible for drawing in half of their business."}
{"text":"Razzoo's is one of the best restaurants around Concord Mill's.  The food is great, the waiters are also great and the ambiance is really great.  I must warn, all of the items on the menu are pretty spicy.  But if you like spicy food like me this is the place to go.  You have to try the gator tail and the stuffed shrimp and the rat toes for appetizer.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you have little ones as I mentioned before, It is pretty spicy.  They do have a kids menu but most of it is pretty bland."}
{"text":"Very bland food. Tried several times and different dishes.  All very blahhhh.  I've been to New Orleans many times and this very vaguely reminds me of the food there.  Very very vaguely.   Nice ambiance and excellent service tho."}
{"text":"Today was my very first time dining here and it will definitely be my last. I have never been treated so rudely by a server as I was today with my server (Paige). She seemed to be very annoyed by the questions I was asking about the menu. I ordered a Dr.Pepper to drink, the gator tail appetizer, and some kind of sampler for my entree. After she brought the appetizer, she never came back to check on me again. I watched her stand behind the bar and chat with other servers and I watched her check on every other table around me but she completely ignored me and all of my attempts to get her attention. I never got a drink refill and she never even looked in my direction. I actually saw another patron walk past me with his glass in his hand looking for someone to refill his drink.  After waiting over 20 mins with no server and no entree ever being brought out, I got up and asked another server for the manager. As soon as the server went to the back to get the manager, my server came rushing out with my entree. I told her that I no longer wanted the entree, she said \"ok\" and the rolled her eyes and walked away. When the manager came out to greet me, he had nothing but excuses for his terrible staff, saying that \"this doesn't normally happen\". That's a big lie judging by the other negative reviews coming from people who had the same experience. He also said he will check with the server and her workload. The restaurant was pretty much empty except for a few people sitting at the bar, myself, and a couple of other tables. It was far from a \"full house\". The staff here is just lazy. I cancelled my entree and paid for just the gator tails and left."}
{"text":"I've been to the Razzoo's a bunch of times and have yet to have a problem or anything bad. Service is consistent and the food is always delicious. I'm not an expert on Cajun food but I know the blackened chicken pasta is awesome. The chef came out once and was mulling around talking to everyone asking how they liked what they had ordered and we got a chance to talk to him about the sauce used in the pasta dish. He explained how it was made and it is quite amazing that there is a chain restaurant that makes a sauce from scratch. It's cream based sauce spiced just right, not to hot. If you're in town for a speedway event or any other of the many attractions, be sure to give this dish a try. Bottom right hand side of the menu, comes in either chicken, shrimp or if you can't decide they'll do a little of both. Get a little extra sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their fishbowl drinks and spicy food. I've had good service but the atmosphere doesn't always seem to be as excited as I am about the restaurant..."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good restaurant.  A bit salty at times.  Their fried catfish is pretty good but their baby back ribs are great, better than most places."}
{"text":"Stopped here once with my brother-in-law and his two kids. Staff was great. Portions were larger than expected. Completely different atmosphere than Cajun Queen, but in our opinion  the food at Razzoo's is better."}
{"text":"After a long day of car shopping, Razoo's really hit the spot! We ordered the seafood fondue dip with shrimp and it was delicious!! I ordered the stuffed shrimp and my boyfriend got the blackened chicken po boy. Both were fantastic and the service was great! There's a nice little outdoor seating area that was perfect for the 75 degree weather in January! Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome portions. Service has been good each time we went. The menu has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Bad service. I always liked Razzos when I lived in TX. Been here 3 times and only once did I get great service. Other times, I've come solo and sat at the bar. Only minority in the bar and the bartenders/servers never come to check on me let alone place an order. Place was empty with only 2 other Caucasians that received orders. Bad customer service, don't really like to use the race card but not a coincidence this has happened to me at this location twice in 4 months. Couldn't find a manager to complain so just left. Travel from Pineville and get this service? Pathetic, racist restraurant! I'm sure I would have enjoyed the food, if I got a chance to place an order or get some service I might give them more than one star."}
{"text":"This was my first time and i have to day i was impressed. Loved the atmosphere and the glass bottle decorations. I had the cajun 2 ways and was definitely satisfied. The food was delicious the spices gave the food a great kick and the crawdads were amazing. i will definitely be returning and would recommend this if you want a great change of pace."}
{"text":"The food here is definately different....i loved the rat toes....i know it sounds disguisting but it jalepenos stuffed with chesse and deepfried but the jalepenos were huge...i ordered a cajun seafood dish and it,was delicious but I got so full off my drink and appitizzer I could hardly eat....but good try if you havent ever tryed them!"}
{"text":"I had the Honeysuckle ribs they were just like the menu said, fall of the bone tender.  I was impressed they made a substitute for my non carb diet with no hassle and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars bc I have eaten there before and there food is great. You have to try the crawfish dip it is delicious.  My father and I went there last Monday before we indulged in our day of mall christmas shopping and we walked out. They weren't busy and two servers walked by us several times and after 10 mins of not being helped I even let the hostess know that no one even said hello to us. So a server came over and said someone would be right with us. So we waited still no one evn came to get our drinks so we left. I hope this was just a bad day for them bc the food is delicious! Terrible service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Concord to go! Such a great, fun, family oriented restaurant with as close as you'll get to traditional Cajun cuisine. Service is great! Good is great!"}
{"text":"I absolutly love Razzos i have been going there for years and love everything from there wings and drinks to there salads and stuffed shrimp me and my bff are regulars before we hit the mall"}
{"text":"Franchised Cajun.  Stick to the stuff that's been fried. Don't bother with blackened chicken chicken or fish, Razzoo's is all about the fryer. One star food.  Cold beer and friendly staff salvaged a second star.   Won't be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great crawfish and oysters, this is not the place. The crawfish were tiny and tasted previously frozen. I know - I've bought crawfish at the grocery store before. Plus, you order two pounds and the bottom 1/3 of the bowl contains nothing but legs and claws.  The oysters are about the size of a 1/2 teaspoon, though they were tasty.  We had to ask for napkins.  Just not the place to go for oysters and crawfish."}
{"text":"Very good Cajun.  On par with many places in New Orleans.  Amazing that is outside a Mall in North Carolina ..."}
{"text":"I only get to Charlotte/Condord 2 to 3 times a year, usually for events at the racetrack, but I always make my way over to Razoo's for dinner. I have tried about everything on the menu at some time or another. It's all so good. And they have a sampler in case you don't know what to get. Not many places still do that. The food and service is always fantastic. I have never seen a chain where the atmosphere, food or service didn't decline over time, but Razoo's is the exception. The Quality and service have never flinched in all the years I've been going there. The place is always clean and organized. The staff are always neat and friendly. Wish they would open one near Myrtle Beach."}
{"text":"This place is easy to catch your eye from the outside and worth stopping in. We had the raw oysters as an appetizer. They tasted very good, several were on the small side though. I had the Cajun 2-way with shrimp. It was popcorn shrimp and shrimp ettouffee' (can't spell that Cajun dish).  The in house cherry-mustard sauce is very tasty with the fried shrimp and the fries. Nothing was greasy. Great place to eat as you watch some football on one of their many placed tv's.  Sweet tea was good, but I always think $2.50 for tea is too high, but hey its customers choice. Everything else seemed priced reasonable. I will definitely return here if in Concord, something different to eat and oh, they had well informed staff of the menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic atmosphere and even better food!"}
{"text":"Man.... I tell ya, every time my wife and I go here, it is just delicious. The staff is trained very well, the food is consistent, hot, fresh, good portions, friendly staff, everything is done well. I hate to say it, but their ribs are as good as any I've had. Fried food is great, good technique, hot and crispy... Traditional cajun dishes are always fantastic. Never been disappointed....."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I haven't had one bad dish here. I highly recommend rat toes!"}
{"text":"Before I quit eating pork I loved the Cajun combo skillet! It has crawfish, sausage, chicken and shrimp over a bead of rice and beans. The portion was a nice healthy size and also came with toasted garlic bread and corn on the cob. I love this place and definitely recommend. The service is also great if dining in."}
{"text":"Food here is terrific. Very tasty. Seasoned just right.  I get either the étouffée, jambalaya or gumbo.  All are very good.  This place is a little pricey. Even for lunch. I spent $15 on a plate of étouffée and ice tea. The other problem about this place is that they blast the music.  Hard to have a conversation with a friend.  But this restaurant will certainly tickle your taste buds."}
{"text":"I just got home after dining at Razzoo's with my family.  I had read the reviews here and decided to give it a try.  We arrived for an early dinner, around 4:30pm and the restaurant was not too busy.  We were seen right to our table but then we waited for quite some time before a server came over to take our drink order.  We were not the only table who sat waiting for drink orders.  I saw at least 2 others waiting patiently also.  Then the server came and took our drink order but the other 2 tables had had enough and got up and left the restaurant.  I could not blame them, as I was about to do the same just as the server arrived at our table.    I ordered the shrimp and catfish combo and my wife had the catfish plate.  The fish was good but it sure seemed to have been frozen and not battered there in the restaurant.  As I said, the fish was still pretty good as was the shrimp.    We probably would have tried a couple other menu items, such as the gator tail and Gumbo had we not been in a sour mood from the waiting to take our drink order.    I will probably give this place another try, as I attribute the exceedingly long wait in part, to the time of day."}
{"text":"The platter had a nice combination of sausage shrimp and beans. The ambience was really cool. Definitely try out the cocktails served in Jars."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Every time I visit Charlotte, I always have to visit here and the Concord Mills Mall. It is very unique and I had never heard of a Razoo's before until I went to this location. They have Louisiana Cajun style food. It is sorta like an Cajun Outback (but much better). They have good jalepeno hush puppies which are good. Prices are reasonable for the portion you get. I wish there was a Razoo's in SC!!!! I really want to try their frozen alcoholic beverages and their seafood gumbo. When I come back in town, I definitely will!"}
{"text":"Service and food was good, but to receive more then 3 stars from us you will have to step up your seasoning game. Especially for a cajun restaraunt. We ordered the $65 Jaws option as well as the Gator Punch fish bowl. If you know NC laws, fish bowl drinks are going to taste like fruit punch due to the amount of liquor legally allowed in a single drink. We liked the atmosphere there, so what the hell??? Be festive, right? Drink was good in flavor for $9 and we got beads. Portion of food was tremendous, then again it was a $65 plate. Tarter sauce was scrumptious. Never eaten gator before, it was the best thing on the plate. Crawfish was a little fishy, def some improvement needed there. We will return at least one more time to tried the unfried items on the menu."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant,  Razzoo's isn't a bad Cajun attempt at food when you can't get the real thing.  Having been fortunate enough to be in NOLA and Louisiana twice this year, that comment really gets knocked back into perspective if you LOVE this type of food.  For Charlotte, however, Razoo's is a great stop for some food that is perhaps outside of your wheel house.   Fried pickles, very good, and better than most of the ones you will get at other restaurants that are around them there in restaurant mecca Concord.  Crawfish etoufee ( don't even think about messing with the shrimp), again very good for something in Charlotte, NC. Just a small warning for those that don't like spicy, the roux in this dish can sometimes have a little bit of a kick, but it isn't bad.  The chicken tchoupitoulas is a really good dish that the mister used to get more often until the prices reached where they are now. Fishah yee is also a very good choice as is the Stuffd Fish. Green beans seem to always be the veggie of the day, but there are those occasions that it is something else like black eyed beans or corn.  If you get a salad, you MUST get the fried onion strips and tell 'em not to be stingy with them. They are  that good!   There really isn't a bad thing on the menu- never had the burger- and the pasta is VERY GOOD.  However, I really wouldn't bother with the po' boys.  THIS should be experienced in NOLA.  Oh, the Leidenheimer bread most use in NOLA for their 'boys! Catfish the last few times I had it there- in the last 18 months or so- had changed to much smaller pieces that weren't as good as what they used before, but that might have changed. I was disappointed in their bread pudding- just not very much true bread pudding taste happening there. Sweet tea is usually always good- this is a big deal for my personal dining party. Razoo's is a good primer for anyone interested in experiencing this type of food for the first time, but I hope that you will, at some point, be able to truly experience the REAL DEAL."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  Portions are huge, luckily you can order half orders.  Bread pudding is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to go. The food is great. They have alligator tail, it is seasonal. They always have crawfish. Service is always great."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place, but a friend recommended it and we're glad he did. Very good quality seafood. I got the stuffed fish and my wife got the Tchoupitoulas (have fun trying to say this!) and we were impressed. Kids meals included a drink and were reasonably priced at $5.29. Very good, friendly service. I'd have to come back and try a few more dishes to give it 5 stars, but after one visit this place really is a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"My fav restaurant! From the chicken fondue to the country fried chicken/steak...worth every penny! The staff is friendly and it's never a long wait (unless it's a holiday) and the alcohol selection is a good one although the pickings are slim. Try either the bread pudding or cheesecake which has a funny name (something dancer) for dessert you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Food and service are great! Just be careful not order too much stuffs, their Cajun size is crazy huge."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food I'd just great. You gotta try the crayfish cheese dip! Not crazy spicy but it has a nice kick."}
{"text":"Great food, nice beer selection and a friendly bartender. The gumbo and jambalaya were excellent! The bartenders recommendation of OMB Amber beer was perfect! What more can you ask for? I only wish that this restaurant was closer to my home in Madison VA."}
{"text":"Great stop for us on the way to Highpoint. Hubby was craving shrimp, gumbo, etc - got it all and loved it. I ordered ribs that fell off the bone. With beers and sides, we still got out cheap. Waitresses were super friendly and took care of us. About 4.5 stars for the price !"}
{"text":"There aren't many Cajun restaurants in the area to compete w/ Razoo's.  However, this place won't disappoint! If you like spicy food you will enjoy eating here. They serve 'Nawlins style food including fish, chicken, and crawdads/crayfish. This is only place in the area that I know of that serves crawfish. If you aren't a fan of seafood, the menu is big enough to accommodate your tastes.   Additionally, the drinks here are great. Sometimes, my friend and I come here on Friday nights just for a drink or two. I love their frozen \"Mardi-rita\" and potent \"Worm Burner.\"  The service is good/average and the decor is colorful, as the theme is Mardi Gras-esque."}
{"text":"Great food and generally great service.  Price is a dollar or two higher than other places in the area.   Would be nice if they provided a basket of bread with the meal especially given the price.   Stuffed shrimp is the best"}
{"text":"Awesome place to get some New Orleans style food, great atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food for a \"chain\" restaurant. ( Although to be fair, I've not encountered another.) The skillet is the perfect dish to order if you can't make up your mind! The andouille sausage had a nice subtle sweet flavor and the crawfish etouffee was devoured so quickly I could hardly tell you what it tasted most like!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food, and good drinks! I had a watermelon drink that came in a mason jar which was delicious. Food is spicy, but good! Wish we had one nearby us."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. My husband loved it as well he had the fried gator tail. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Based on the Yelp review my wife and I ate dinner Thursday night.  We were not disappointed.  We ordered catfish, crawfish and crawfish etouffee as we love  crawfish. The crawfish was good but the catfish was unbelievably good. It was light battered, not greasy at all and flaky.....delicious. The hush puppies were also very good.  We have found a new favorite in the Concord area.  The only negative part of the experience was we had to wait about 20 minutes to get the food and it wasn't that crowded. Luckily we had plenty of time."}
{"text":"I went here for my very first time last week, and I must say I was so pleased. Great food, service, and atmosphere. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Shopping in Concord Mills and dropped in for dinner.First time here and we LOVE it!  Great Cajun food for a reasonable price. Nice size portion. Friendly staff. Seafood Gumbo is DELICIOUS!  We had fried pickle chip, Cajun Tricky fish which is a blackened cajun talapia over jambalaya rice and comes with veggie of the day and a big slice of buttered garlic toast. Cajun Skillet -andoullie sausage over dirty rice, red brean rice, corn on cob and buttered toast.  All was really good. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hahaha, this place is laughable.  There is no thought what so ever in their menu items. Everything is far to repetitive; there is no texture, or no flavor. It gets old after the 1st bite. Literally, maybe even less.  I'm not a picky person, and I know what good food tastes like. I don't mind tasting different foods, but if I ever had to come back here (if it was a matter of life or death [seriously, I'd only go if someone held a gun to my head and told me too... eh, even then I wouldn't] -) so we can forget about this sentence. The waitress was the valley girl of the west. She was always laughing, never made eye contact, pointed out something in the menu with a spaghetti arm, and said 'like' a lot. It was very annoying. She gave us our plates in the middle of our meal. She gave us our drinks towards the end. It was just horrible service overall.  Unfortunately, I went to Sticky Fingers before this place. And if you compare the two, Sticky Fingers is so much better, and I felt so horribly miserable that day, because I had to end my night with food like that.  The menu had cool drawings on it, which was the only plus side.  I'm very happy to say that I will never eat here again. Ever. In my entire life."}
{"text":"Overall experience was pleasent.  We opted to sit at the bar since the wait was so long on a Saturday night.  The bar staff was quite prompt and curtious. As far as food is concerned, I would not have been so disappointed had Razzoo's called itself a \"Raw Bar\" as opposed to a \"Cajun Cafe\", as their dished are FAAAAAAAR from authentic cajun fare.  The \"roux\" for the jambalaya is non-existent and many of the dishes are over-the-top spicy just for the sake of being spicy.  I ordered the grilled gator tail over jambalaya, as that was one of a very few items that was not fried.  The gator was super tasty and grilled to the perfect point to where it wasn't rubbery.  Again, if the menu had just referred to the jambalaya as \"a spicy seafood enfused rice\" or something of the like, I would've been fine.  What was beneath the gator was NOTHING like jambalaya. If you want a fun, raw bar environment, this is a great place for you.  If its authenic cajun cuisine you seek, stick with Cajun Queen, or the newly opened Creole's in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Friendly service, affordable menu.. and great drinks what more can you ask for. The only thing I did not like about this place it take a while for my food arrival to our table."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, but had a horrible experience.  Our bartenders took a few minutes to greet us, even though we were the only guests at the bar and a few feet away.  We ordered a few apps, the pickles and the fried crayfish tails, and really disliked both.  The breading on the crayfish was mushy and salty, and the tails themselves were flavorless, textureless, and colorless.  The pickles would have been ok, but they were mushy as well.  We told our bartender that we really didn't care for the crayfish, and her response was to say 'Oh,' and walk away.   We've heard a lot of people say good things about it, and maybe we just chose bad dishes or the kitchen was having an off day, but I was completely disappointed.  We may go back again and amend the rating, but I'll have to wait until I've gotten the awful taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Razzoo's is great as long as you like Cajun kick to your meal. If not or there is someone in your party who doesn't they may prefer to go elsewhere. As a personal spicy food lover I've never gotten anything I didn't enjoy. From the blackened chicken salad to the Cajun pasta it's all great! They have a good mix of local beers as well. If beer isn't your thing I've seen several tables with giant fishbowls that seem to be delicious and a guest favorite! I'm craving razzoo's just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Razzoo's for an early dinner before a concert. Cool interior and atmosphere overall.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal, but it is not authentic cajun. Two of us had the Combo Skillet which includes andouille, red beans, shrimp creole, and étouffée. The dirty rice reminded me of a store bought mix. The andouille was OK, but not very favorable. The shrimp and crawdads were cooked very well, not over cooked, but the dishes just lacked something. The red beans were cooked to mush as was the corn on the cob.  One in our party got the Tchoupitoulas, a chicken dish which she enjoyed. Another got the Tricky Fish and said the blackened fish was good, but did not like the étouffée and agreed with my opinion of the dirty rice. The best looking dish was the fried catfish and shrimp which was reportedly very good.  We also got the rat toes (gloried jalapeño poppers) and fried crawdad tail appetizers, which were OK.   We were seated promptly, but it was early. Our waiter was very slow with drink refills - we typically had to ask.  I would go back, maybe, but stick to more generic items like appetizers or fried seafood. Don't go here expecting real Cajun food."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a place guaranteed to find a spicy meal, Razzoo's Cajun Café in the Concord Mills area of Concord, NC. This restaurant offers a variety of entries but, from what I've tasted, they all have one thing in common, some level of heat from mild to atomic hot.  Dora here. I really like their colorful exterior and that continues on the inside with upcycled materials. I also appreciate the ample space between booths and tables and the generous parking.   The menu had so many items that I would like to try. I chose the Cajun Combo Skillet, Andouille sausage, shrimp creole, crawfish etoufee, and red beans 'n rice, with a side of fried okra. Now this was a great dish with varying levels of flavor and heat. My favorite and the spiciest was the crawfish etoufee served on dirty rice, which was loaded with crawfish in a dark roux sauce. This was outstanding, very rich and smooth and just the right intensity. The shrimp creole was great with juicy shrimp and a spicy creole sauce served over fluffy white rice.  Dora here. Did I really complain about lack of heat in last week's dish? Guess Ernie decided to fix that with this week's restaurant suggestion. Sheesh. :wiping my brow: I'll tell you right now that I fought ordering a chicken dish off the menu, but eating at a Cajun restaurant calls for stepping out of your comfort zone, right? Well, I veered way out! Usually I don't order fish because it tends to be too, well, fishy tasting, but the Stuffed Fish was not at all. And if it weren't for the menu, I might never have suspected that the fish was studded with a subtle shrimp and crab stuffing. The sauce had a smooth buttery flavor, and the fish was tender and flakey with an afterburner kick of heat. Tame, actually, compared to Ernie's forehead and neck slicker. He could've used a towel to go along with his napkin. haha.  What's your favorite seafood dish? We'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog https://torikayson.com/2017/04/22/excited-about-eating-by-ernie-dora-hiers-22/"}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans I'm never ever impressed with \"cajun/creole\" resturants outside of Louisiana. Going in my expectations were very low and I expected bland commercial cuisine. I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The flavors were well developed. It wasnt just bland heavily spicy food. It has nothing on resturants in New Orleans. But generally places outside of the Boot don't. But I'd recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with a meal here, from the gator tail and terrific catfish to their etouffee and incredible bread pudding. My absolute favorite restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Love Razoos! Amazing food, and fun atmosphere. Definitely a place to eat if, you want to have a fun dinner with family or friends."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Jessica was very friendly and helpful when trying to select a good entree. It was my first time and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The drinks are awesome.  We are always treated nice by the staff when we go here, my fiancé and I.  I love the New Orleans feel of the place.  The gator tails which are not on the menu... you have to request them, are delicious.  I enjoy the crawfish and shrimp fondue."}
{"text":"We stopped by this again after a shopping trip at the nearby mall. It was Cinco de Mayo and instead of going to On The Border which was right next door, we decided on Razoo's because of the incredible experience the first time we went there. What a disappointment. We were seated at a table near a booth full of what seemed like employees on their day off. It would have been fine if it weren't for them being obnoxiously loud while playing music from their phones. Our server was Trey and it started off great. Our  Gatorpunch which is served in a fishbowl took a while to come out and as excited as I was for it, it was ridiculously sweet. Like pure sugar. A different server brought out our app and our server never came by to check on us. He seemed busy with the table of coworkers. They finally settled down when it seemed like a manager(?) sat at another table close to them. Our shrimp and crawfish dip was amazing once again. So much shrimp and the bread was super garlicky and toasty! I ordered the hurricane shrimp off of their lunch menu. The shrimp was fried and huge! It was served over extremely bland white rice in a skillet with a less than desirable spicy honey pepper sauce. The best part of the dish was the garlic bread. I would've told Trey but he once again he did not come back to check on us for at least 15-20 min. By that time we were ready to get a to go box and the check. My husband ordered the shrimp platter which was delicious. Huge fried shrimp again with a cherry mustard sauce that we shared because the other sauce that came with my food was gross. The cherry mustard sauce was something unique and I really liked it! I wish I could've gotten it for my meal but I was ready to go. The fries and hush puppies were flawless once again! I was really bummed out by the service and food this time around. The ambience was also ruined by the loud group in the booth as well.           So so so happy that my husband looked up this place in concord! We went shopping and this restaurant was right by the mall. The decor is really cool and a cross between fishing and southern living. It was only 5PM so it was pretty empty for a Wednesday evening.  The waitress was extremely helpful in explaining the menu since it was our first time there. She even brought us out a sample of alligator which was very tasty. We started off with a seafood fondue which was out of this world. There were huge pieces of shrimp and crawfish in the dip and the bread that is served to dip was nice and toasted and slathered in a delicious buttery garlic sauce. So worth it! My husband ordered ribs (I know who orders ribs in a seafood place right?) well EVERYONE SHOULD TRY THE RIBS!! Hands down one of the best we have ever had. It is worth every penny. Literally falls off of the bone and has like 3 side dishes. Fries, rice and something else. I ordered the spicy shrimp po boy. Wow wow wow. It was huge! Amazing flavor with everything put together. I really love all my bread toasted and the bread was once again perfection. It was also slathered in butter which just added to the amazing flavors of spicy shrimp, tarter sauce, and the rest of the toppings on the sandwich. The Cajun fries were also amazing. They were perfectly crispy and the Cajun seasoning really brought it home. The jalapeños hush puppies were a pleasant surprise. Can't complain about anything! Although I will be sure to try their fishbowls the next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"I have ate here SEVERAL times and never had an issue/complaint. Service is always outstanding, drinks are strong ;).  I always order the stuffed shrimp! Yummm!"}
{"text":"Although in the middle of concord mills', we found this place surprisingly authentic, reasonably priced, and, most importantly, delicious.  We would definitely recommend this place to somebody looking for something a bit outside the norm."}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice meal and GREAT drinks, try the worm burner or the Gator punch! Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go. It's better than most chain restaurants and has unique options. If you're by the mall this is probably you're best option. My husband loves this place so I've been probably 5-6 times over the past few years and just have never been impressed. Nothing is bad, but nothing is amazing."}
{"text":"Recently tried Razzoo's and I must say not bad at all. I decided to have the shrimp stuffed with crab stuffing. Pretty interesting I must say. You get about 8-9 large shrimp stuffed full of crab stuffing drizzeled with creole sauce over a skillet of rice. You also get a small bowl of buttery green beans and a slice of garlic bread for about $14.  Just enough kick to it to ...though I am not a spicy food person.  Definitely will try again :)"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal. I felt like I was in Louisiana eating a Cajun mother's dinner. The food was authentic, fulfilling, and sooooooo delicious. The atmosphere was very welcoming and enjoyable and the waiters and waitresses were very nice and respectful. The best thing about the place though was that they had large portions for such a low price. I've spent more on a hamburger than I did there."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, if you come here, you need to ask for Camille, she was very good. Being the first time here she told us about everything. A+++ Service."}
{"text":"I would love to give 5stars but I was really disappointed to see the entire day shift staff parking on the first row(5/5/18). We were the first patrons and even waited on the bench outside for the door to be unlocked so I know that it wasn't customers. It's bad business for the convenience of staff to be the inconvenience of paying customers.  As for the food, it was an experience. Presentation & taste were on point. We tried several things on the menu because it was our first time visiting. No complaints on temperature or delivery. Our waitstaff was polite and attentive. We had a lot of questions about the menu and she did not disappoint. The atmosphere is fun!  *editing review to add one star because the owner responded to my review expeditiously & appropriately"}
{"text":"Gumbo is excellent. Fried catfish is pretty good too. Service was okay. Kids meals are decently portioned for the price. We were there for Saturday lunch and it was not as busy as I expected, which was actually nice."}
{"text":"I agree w/the last posters...GREAT FOOD!...I usually as a rule shy away from chain restaurants but this has KILLER food and a decnt bar.....crawfish are OFF DA HOOK!"}
{"text":"Food and service were great both times we have eaten here. Really enjoyed the crawfish tails app and the ribs were great!"}
{"text":"The etoufee made with crawfish is awesome. It's spicy but I liked the flavor. I've had it 3 times.  I tried the shrimp creole once, but defiantly liked the etoufee better. It's not really my favorite quzine, but I like to go there occasionally for a change.  The service is great, fast and friendly.  I would definitely go there again. Kind of a bar type atmosphere and my kids don't like spicy food at all."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The staff was friendly and helpful. Had the gatortail basket - it's not on the menu but they do offer it as a meal not only the appetizer. The bread pudding is delicious. It's HUGE so it's enough to share."}
{"text":"The service is very slow, and unwilling to please the Customers. Be prepared to wait at least 30-40 minutes for your food.  Not a good place to go if you're super hungry"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is fun and inviting, the food is spectacular, even when they're busy you'll still get great service- what else can you ask for?  I had the crab stuffed shrimp, which was honestly the best shrimp I've ever had and an order of the crawdad tails for an appetizer. Honestly, just incredible food, can't wait to go back!  And don't forget to check out the cute tshirts for sale... I definitely bought two!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Cajun and spicy food, I am a work in progress.  I'm attempting to get my palette better versed in spice.  My boyfriend and I were looking for a change in our typical go-to places when he suggested Razzoo's and boy, did he make a good suggestion!  He had the crawfish etoufee (amazing) and I had a Shrimp Po' Boy and it was MASSIVE.  It was delirious, well spiced and presented.  Is it authentic?  I don't know - I hope to head to New Orleans this winter for a vacation but I can tell you I loved it.  We ate at the bar and the staff was great - They were quick to refill our beers and gave great service.  I loved it, I have been craving it since and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Charlotte/Concord area. I enjoy Cajun type food versus the average \"American\" food. The staff is very friendly and they all wear cool T-shirts that they also sell. Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait time to get in, but for me it's worth it! I love the alligator and everyone I've taken to try it has also loved it including my two young daughters. It is very kid friendly which is always a plus for me. There menu is amazing and can be a little bit overwhelming! I'm a seafood kind of person so there are plenty of options. I enjoy this place and look forward to my next visit. I only live about 1/2 a mile from it so I plan on many more meals here!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim.  Food was awesome!  Travis our server was very knowledgeable and had great suggestions!   Definitely will be back and will be asking for Travis!"}
{"text":"Huge portion sizes so I love the half plate option. They had the best jambalaya I've ever had. It was amazing! Our waitress was awesome and so was the atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best ribs I have ever had and I've eaten a lot of ribs. The service was exceptional. The signature drinks are tasty and most definitely worth the cost. I will be visiting Razoos often."}
{"text":"Surprisingly tasty cajun food. This place is located in Concord right by the big mall so the location is convenient. They offer a nice variety cajun and creole foods.   I ordered Cajun Combo skillet and shared oysters for an appetizer with my family. The combo had grilled andouille sausage, shrimp creole, etouffe, red bean and rice, and veggies. It was definitely a lot of food. Everything was good and the service was very friendly. I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat!  I always order the fried chicken Po Boy, which is awesome!  The Po Boy comes with shrimp or chicken - Cancun or FrIed with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and mayo.  Along side the meal, I ordered the raspberry tea.  The service is excellent as well!  Sydney was my server and she was great.  She constantly checked on me to ensure I was satisfied with my meal and asked if I needed anything.  Come out to Razaroos for Fat Tuesday 2018."}
{"text":"Came to Razzoos tonight and it was great. The crab stuffed shrimp were delish-as usual. Hubby had an issue with his meal, but when the server notified the manager, he immediately came out, apologized and made it right! No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Not only do I think this is the best restaurant around the mall but I also think they have the best cajun style food in the Charlotte area. Yes Boudreux's and Cajun Queen I said it. Now if you dont like spicey cajun food then don't go. I have brought many people to Razzoo's and no one has left disapointed. The food is great, flavorful and they give huge portions. Razzoos has some great signature coctails as well as Boudreux's but the price is no where close. As for the flavor and price it beats Cajun Queens hands down as well. They do have a bayou feel to their restaurant. They also have a very good looking staff. As for the food expect to find all your cajun greats.... andouille, gator tail, grilled gator, etoufee, dirty rice, gumbeaux, crawfish etc. I recommend two dishes. If you like a lot of food and enjoy fried food get the Jaws. It is a heaping portion of all kinds of fried seafood and fried pickles and fries. If you want to try a bunch of different things then I recommend the cajun skillet. It comes with andouille, shrimp creole, etoufee, beans and rice, and vegetables."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here! I'm told that everything on the menu is amazing, but I can only attest to the fried pickles and the Cajun Combo Skillet because that's what I get every time! Great service, great atmosphere! And it's very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had an awesome time catching up with food and drinks! The food was great and the waitress had an excellent recommendation of the shrimp piquant. Of course we didn't know what the hell it was but we read the disruption and took a chance. Omg!!! So delicious!!! Thanks for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere here!!! It's a nice change from all the restaurant that have all the same stuff and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"This place has two things I love great drinks that come in huge glasses and TONS of alcohol and amazing Cajun seafood!!!  I love this place! I always have a great time when I come, I look forward to trying new items and just having a good time! I love how the music is playing in the parking lot and you never know what is going to be written in the chalk outside the entrance. The employees open the door for you and greet you with a smile and then once you get inside, the decor is awesome! I always feel very inspired to take a trip to the bayou when I leave here!   For starters we tried the Rat Toes....I will warn you if you don't LOVE spicy this is not the appetizer for you! Its jalapenos loaded with crab stuffing and then deep fried....a delicious sauce is on the side that kinda cools them down but they are packed with heat!   To drink I recommend the Gator Punch...it's a huge bowl that reminds me of fruit punch with an alcohol kick. It is delicious....the fruity flavors and the liquor are a nice complement to the seafood!  For our main entree I had the stuffed shrimp and my friend had the Catfish Platter. Both options are WINNERS in my book. The shrimp are stuffed with crab meat and then cooked with a sauce over rice....and served in a big skillet....does it get any better? The juices and sauce runs off the shrimp and seasons up the rice and put together is like a party in your mouth!   The catfish is fried golden brown, with tons of flavor in the seasoning and batter. They come with jalapeno hush puppies and fries.   You will literally be fighting over everyone's plate here, the service is great and all in all is just a good time!   I really enjoyed my experience and always look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Went here at lunch for Mother's Day. Terrible service! Waited an hour for the food to come out. By this time there were people who were seated after us, and they had gotten their food and were almost done before we had to call a manager over. Once she came over, all she had to say was \"oh your ticket is in the window, let me get it for you\" and then we never saw her again. Of course, food was cold! Server came to check on us, we tell her food is cold. Doesn't get manager, all she can say is \"oh we are really busy.\"  I have been here way busier than this and gotten my food a lot faster. Terrible service. Will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I have to say the atmosphere is good and the waiters and friendly and fast and the food is delicious I had the Cajun taliapia fish with dirty rice and a bread pudding bread with pecans and peaches serve warm with dark rum! OMG DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a chain restaurant in a busy location, but I was disappointed by my jambalaya pasta.  The sausage was pretty low quality that made the entire dish not as tasty, but the shrimp in it was good.  There also wasn't jambalaya over rice - just pasta which made the meal very heavy and not saucy enough to balance out the penne. Being far off from what you get in New Orleans is a given, but I've had great jambalaya andouille in Columbus, Ohio, so I guess I just had higher expectations here.  However, my husband's crawfish etoufee was good, after adding the table hot sauce (more vinegary than hot).  The service was also nice, and I loved the restaurant's decor, so I wish I could give this a 3.5."}
{"text":"My crew and I set around the bar because of the sweet decor. The bartender was great and had great recommendations. Next time I'm in this area, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you can tell this is going to be a fun place. Then you sit down and get the menu, and every hope is fulfilled. It's covered back and front with little jokes, quips, slang, and general fun. In fact, the entire front is just artwork. That's an attitude that continues throughout the meal and the place - fun, N'Awlins style backcountry relaxed cookin'.   Jazz plays loudly enough to be fun but not too loud to be disturbing from under the neon. There's lots of tables so you probably won't have to wait long (there was no wait for us on a Saturday night). Get ready for some fun!  One of my very few complaints is that the drink menu doesn't have prices. But it DOES feature some very generous servings. Good luck finishing the gator punch with only 2 or 4 people!   Everything on the menu looks amazing to be honest. I couldn't resist trying the gator tail, and it's by far the best made gator I've ever had. Gator can be very chewy, but they sliced it thin, spiced, and cooked it to perfection.   We also got the crawfish fondue appetizer, which is decent, but you DEFINITELY should get it with a side of \"ouch\" sauce. In fact get everything you order with ouch sauce. And then get some ouch sauce for your ouch sauce. It's not very spicy, but it's amazingly tasty.   My friend got the stuffed shrimp which were also good but less filling. And the desserts looked amazing but we were as stuffed as the shrimp. The only change I'd make is getting a different side than green beans.   The prices are excellent as well. The food is way better than anything you could get at TGI fridays, Olive Garden, or the like, and it's probably cheaper. It's also much more unique than those places.   As noted, the music is a great complement to the atmosphere. It's still somehow quiet enough to carry on conversation at a nice volume. Magic. And all the decor is super well done.    Apparently the only other place this chain exists is Texas. So enjoy this gem, Charlotte! You got super lucky they decided to open one here, for whatever reason. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"We went to Razzoo's for Sunday dinner. I wanted to like this place because I love Cajun food. I wasn't expecting much maybe Applebee's level quality. The service was excellent. Our waitress was amazing and super attentive. She even corrected a mistake made my the kitchen before I even had the chance to complain, she spotted it immediately. If I were to give this place any higher a rating it would be because of her.  Unfortunately people go to restaurants for the food not the service.   The boudin balls were bland and icky. They were nothing like boudin balls I've had elsewhere.  The jambalaya pasta was okay. It was average at best.  The seafood gumbo was extremely disappointing. It wasn't actually gumbo which is soupy and watery. It was essentially filled with rice and not what you expect gumbo to be.  Stuffed shrimp was terrible. I feel totally let down by the yelper recommendations. The stuffing tasted almost rancid and gross. I ate one shrimp and all of it ended up in the trash.  Overall, it was one of those dinners where you leave kind of depressed you just spent $60 on a really yucky dinner. Meh avoid this place."}
{"text":"Epic failure went to Razzoos for my birthday dinner.  And left without eating a bite of any meal and watching husband eat. First asked for a blackened chicken dish with no mushrooms- if you pick not one vegetable they have to take away all??? No flexibility. So ordered waiters favorite the fried chicken and potatoes with gravy on the side. Entire plate was covered with smoked gravy.   Left with my birthday dinner consisting of smallest glass of wine for $8.00."}
{"text":"BF and I have not been in awhile& had errands to run in Concord, so we decided to grab lunch.  We arrived and was seated promptly, but on the dead side of the  restaurant. We stayed and  did not complain. Our server was polite, but not on his A game.  We were starving and ordered an appetizer and the shrimp was just meh.  Our entrees were decent, just did not taste as  well we had remembered. The employees must have sensed we were just having a mediocre lunch because the manager came to our table. He offered a change to one of the entrees, but seemed like he was just going through the motions. We just paid and tipped well despite spotty service and decided we will probably not be back. Maybe we will try Cajun Queen for a spicy fix."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and a great setting. Everything was fresh and clean, I sat outside where they had a koi fish pond sitting next to you. Loved it!"}
{"text":"So I think the decor and atmosphere is cool! The food was good, although I wish the shrimp was a little better in size and the French fries were nice and hot. The food had good flavor and though not enough spice for me. Overall it was a good."}
{"text":"Razzoo's is our go to restaurant. Everything on the menu is delicious if you eat it at the restaurant. The only reason I give 4 stars is because the food just doesn't taste as good when you order it to go. But eat at the restaurant, and you'll love it! My favorites are the Cajun tricky fish, jambalaya pasta, jalapeño catfish, rat toes, and the shrimp po'boy! All so delicious!"}
{"text":"Get the gator!  Not many places in the Carolinas where you can get that, so this is your place.  Walking distance from Concord Mills, you'll feel transported to Bourbon St as soon as you enter.  Very cool decorations and service was good.  The drinks are also huge and definitely worth trying, especially the peach one.  I'd definitely come back here if I'm in the area again.  A unique find!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Tricky Fish was what I ordered. My expectations were rather low. Cajun seafood in Charlotte didn't rise to high expectations. It was enjoyable though."}
{"text":"Family-friendly atmosphere. The menu you was organized in an interesting manner. The food (gumbo) was decent,  and our server was nice. I recommend it for anyone who is into this style of food. It's not my cup of tea, but it may be yours :)"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Razzoo's, but was hesitant to try. We finally made our way to Concord, in hopes of fulfilling my oyster and crawfish cravings. Upon entering the restaurant, I am automatically drawn to the relaxed, eclectic vibe. Glass bottles, barrels and ropes are amongst a few things that marry the entire atmosphere. I was pretty excited to have some cajun food and curious if Razzoo's could hold its own against my beloved Cajun Queen in Charlotte (yes, yes I know.. that's a pretty hard act to follow!). We ordered a dozen of raw oysters,  a pound of crawfish, the Tchoupitoulas and bread pudding between 2 people. Okay, now let's break it down!   Raw Oysters: Oysters were delicious but sadly, a lot smaller than I expected. It comes with cocktail and horseradish sauce. Be careful with that horseradish! I got a major brain tingle lol ..not sure how else to explain it but let's just say wasabi is typically made from horseradish.  Crawfish: Very flavorful basket of crawfish complemented by a few potatoes.. and only $6.49/lb! If you like spicy foods, try the crawfish in blazin' cajun! Remember, the crawfish isn't listed on the menu, but simply request a few pounds from your server! One pound is probably enough as an appetizer, but I would recommend at least 2 as a meal. Overall, the crawfish was quite tasty. If I just ate the tail then it would have been perfect, but since I normally eat the entire crawfish it was a bit salty.  Tchoupitoulas: mmmm... probably my favorite part of the entire meal! A creamy drizzle over chicken breast on top a bed of potatoes, mushrooms and diced ham that was also marinated with a tasty sauce. So much flavor in every bite! A bowl of greens is also served with this dish - delightful!   Bread Pudding: It makes absolutely no sense why this isn't served with ice cream! Thus, we added a scoop of vanilla ice cream (for an extra $1.50). The perfect combination of warm and cold in a sweet delight. The bread pudding was crunchy on the outside and fluffy/moist on the inside, exactly how dessert should be!  Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Razzoo's. The environment and the tasty food are perfect reasons why this place draws such a crowd (along with alcohol served in giant fish bowls). Razzoo's definitely did surprise (good surprises) me as far as the quality for a franchise, but I would say Cajun Queen still holds my heart in Cajun/Creole cuisine. Nonetheless I enjoyed my dinner at Razzoo's and would give 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"I  love this place.  I've never really had actual Cajun food from Louisiana, but this is the best place I've been too.  The drinks (alcoholic) are wonderful and reasonably priced.  I usually order the Jambalaya pasta with extra Andouille Sausage--- this place had me craving andouille sausage and I never  had it.  For lunch, I like the Zydeco pasta, and guess what? I'm adding the Andouille sausage! Also, the side of bread they have is amazing! I order extra of that.  I also tried the gator!  I order it ocassionally, I think it's pretty great.  They have a colorful atmosphere that I like and the staff is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food always! Her the stuffed shrimp you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is our first time in here and the moment you walk in you know the place is great from the hostess to the waitress  CASEY who always comes back to your table and ask how we're doing, the foods are great and delicious, we brought our friend from California and he loves the place he liked his Cajun Etoufee, we surely are coming  back to this place nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Nothing here is healthy...just FYI. However, our service was decent (the waitress was super sweet but the food was just a little slow). My coworker really liked her meal (I think it was the sampler) but my Fried Shrimp and Catfish combo was just not that great. I felt the corn was a bit on the soggy side and wasn't too much a fan of their Jalapeno Pups. The catfish did not taste fresh at all. This place could use some variety in their menu to be flexible for those who have food restrictions...but perhaps if you do, you probably should just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Judging from the below reviews, I must have just gone on a bad night or something. Can't quite recall what I ordered, but it was some sort of skillet meal that had sausage, beans and rice, etouffe, and corn on the cob. First and foremost, absolutely everything tasted identical. Same exact taste across the board, making it very bland. I want my rice to taste like rice....I want my corn to taste like corn... The different components should have their own flavor. I should not feel like I tongue blasted a Tony Chachere shaker throughout the entire course of the meal. I love Cajun food, I love spicy food, but this was just all one-note, mediocre, pre-made Cajun.  In addition, my meal seemed 100% pre-made and microwaved. Not sure if it was or not, but that's how it tasted. Even the corn on the cob tasted old/soggy.   Over-all, not impressed and not recommended. Maybe in the future i'll give them another try, maybe with something simple like a po boy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic cajun food - then this is the place for you.  The blackened tilapia topped with a crawfish étouffée was so moist and delicious!!"}
{"text":"This was the third time we've been here. We came on a date one time, and with a friend one time and thought it would be perfect for my boyfriends parents who were visiting for two days. The foods always good and the atmosphere is fun!   This however was definitely not the best service we've had here. The waitress did not seem personable, there wasn't any pleasantries when she came to the table and she pretty much did the bare minimum for serving.   We ordered drinks, which we've done on previous visits and know that most of the drinks we got have add ons like beads and gummy worms (it goes with the fun theme!) but when we received them they didn't have any of those. There was also five of us and we ordered two rounds and only one person got a single strand on her final drink.   We started with the crawfish appetizer, and it was so delicious. We finally settled on the full jaws to share, I believe that's what it was called, and it was defiantly worth it! But let me tell you, be ready for fried food and leftovers. It says it can feed four but it could easily feed at least six especially if you get drinks and an appetizer like we did.    Anyways I would recommended it but hopefully you don't get the waitress we had."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and had the stuffed fish. It was really good the beans that came on the side were full of flavor. The rice has a buttered sauce on it which tasted amazing. I would recommended this dish or the stuffed shrimp dish. The service was really good also"}
{"text":"Omg super service. Brought a coworker here and he has a shellfish allergy ... They went out their way to make sure he didn't have anything with shellfish. Changed the dirty rice to a white rice base cause the regular one is made with a shellfish sauce. The chef or manager came out several times to follow up on the meal he ordered.  Our waitress was awesome too. Every time im in town I come here...excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"I yelped this place before I came and since I like creole and Cajun food. I thought it would be awesome. There was a bit of a wait for our table. They get your phone number and text you when your table is ready. Which I think is a good upgrade with technology advancing.   We ordered the Rat toes for an appetizer. We ended up exchanging it for the shrimp fondue. I wasn't fond of the rat toes. It had too much of a kick to it. But the shrimp fondue was great!   I ordered the stuffed fish with corn. This dish was sooo good. Hubby ordered the catfish po boy. We had so much food we couldn't eat it all. Then we had the bread pudding. It was peach and raisin bread pudding with pecans on top. We had lots of left overs and the food wasn't that expensive either for the amount of food we had.   Oh and we had this drink called gator punch. It comes in a big fish bowl. It was very good! If you like sweet fruity drinks this would be a good alcoholic drink. Because I do."}
{"text":"I really like this place and feel lucky that it's the only Razzos that open up out of Texas. I come here for the reasonably price crawfish and stuff shrimp. The drinks are pretty cool. They have fish bowls drinks that can be share with your gf. I never could pass up on their drink on weekend."}
{"text":"(3.75 stars) This Concord Mills establishment is the lone North Carolina outpost of a Dallas-area chain specializing in Louisiana cuisine. How's that for geographic confusion? Whatever its origins, Razzoo's is kitschy beyond belief. Everything from the brightly-colored menus to the ceiling-hung instruments and fishing gear to the music to the very name itself seems like an attempt to be \"fun\" that instead ends in \"Umm....\"  Fortunately, the complaints end there. The menu rounds up the familiar candidates (gumbo, po boys, fried or blackened seafood, etc.), and adds gator, ribs, and raw oysters for some additional variety. For our first visit, my wife and I went with a jalapeno catfish and a Cajun combo skillet respectively. The food greatly exceeded expectations. The catfish was nicely breaded, and there wasn't a thing in my combo skillet (shrimp creole, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice, and andouille sausage) that was a disappointment. The sausage in particular had a good spicy kick and a firm bite.  Though our server was a bit difficult to hear at times (blame the music, maybe), she did a good job of letting us know what was popular and got our food out quickly. Pricing left no regrets. The catfish (which came with bread and a side of corn) ran $10 while my very generously portioned skillet ran a mere $13.  Razzoo's isn't likely to impress Louisiana-bred purists, but for a chain offering in North Carolina, it's a lot better than one would expect it to be."}
{"text":"This place ain't bad at all!  Great food at great prices.  My husband and I went here a few weeks ago when we kicked off our annual Christmas shopping for the kids.  Those crab cakes are sooo yummy!  Hubby liked the food here better than what he got at one of the restaurants in New Orleans on his last business trip!  I got the Cajun Fried Chicken because it's not too spicy and as much as I like spice it don't like me; the chicken took up the entire plate!  They pound it flat and somehow you wind up with more chicken than you can possibly eat!  Maybe it's a perspective thing, I don't know.  What I DO know is I wound up taking over half of it home!  If you're out near the Mills for holiday shopping and you want something different from the norm, try them out!  We noticed they have holiday catering offerings as well, like a whole Cajun turkey.  If we lived closer we'd take them up on that!"}
{"text":"people who have left bad reviews please go shoot yourself my wife and i go ounce a month and drive a hour each way ----THIS PLACE IS GREAT AND THE STAFF VERY POLITE------the manger and assistant was a breath of fresh air it felt like pure family and as for the food all i can say is WONDERFUL from the crawfish fondue to gator tail and omgoodness the the amount of food they give you is more then worth the trip try the fryed green beans (killer) -----IM A DIE HARD RAZZOOS MAN AND MY WIFE ALSO---SO IF YOU WANT GOOD FOOD AND GOOD PEOPLE THAT CARE WHEN YOU SPEAK YOU HAVE TO COME AND HAVE SOME FUN------------------------OH YA AND THEY NEVER SAY (NO)"}
{"text":"Great food. Atmosphere was fun. We love cajun food and this was just the place to go. Bowl of gumbo and some gator nuggets really hit the spot.   Kids menu was good as well. Will defiantly be visiting again."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  With the description on the menu,  i thought my stuffed shrimp would be jumbo but they were average sized shrimp. There was an over load of creamy sauce on top but they were generous with the rice. The fried seafood playter was overly fried and tough."}
{"text":"This was one of my \"go to\" restaurants , sadly my last visit had me disappointed. I went here with a friend who was vegan after a movie. We ordered a salad and I asked for no cucumbers. I got my salad and it had cucumbers on it. I tried to pick them off but they were julienned so there was a lot of them mixed through the salad. I told the waitress and she said she was going to get another one, so they bring the salad out with no cucumbers, but also no crispy onions, I figured this would be an easy fix just to request a side of crispy onions that weee supposed to go on my salad. So I wait..... and I wait..... and I wait.... so the waitress comes out with a plate of sautéed onions and says \"we are out of flour.....so this is what I have for your salad\" I told her \"No Thank You\". Keep in mind this is a place that specializes in frying Cajun food and on a Saturday evening they claim they don't have flour. Also while the waitress was handing me my onions, someone came from the back of the kitchen wearing an apron and was \"observing \" our interaction closely. We asked to speak to the manager as we were baffled that they would be out of flour and the business would have to close the next day. Well the manager was very sweet and said \"of course we have flour in the back , we are a restaurant and how would we not have any flour \". It was the end of the night and the manager took the salad off of our bill. Needless to say I have to bring my money elsewhere if the staff is going to lie to customers"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  The gator tale is definitely a must.  The staff is great. We were traveling back to SC from DC and were able to call in our order.  Sat down to gator tale and our fabulous meal soon followed."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times and the experience has always been pleasant.  The service is always friendly, usually pretty quick, not a very long wait (maybe once on a Friday night, but that's every restaurant in Charlotte) and the atmosphere is very fun, relaxed, and laid-back.    The fried pickle appetizer is AMAZING!!!!  I've ate fried pickles at every restaurant that serves them and razzoo's has the best by far.  I always get the blacken'd chicken and cheese po'boy sandwich which I highly recommend!  And last but not least...the little perk that gave my review it's 5th star is the crazy, fun drink menu!  This restaurant is worth checking out simply if you are having a movie night at concord mills with the girls and you want to grab a couple drinks before or after the movie, razzoo's is the perfect spot.  The fun drink menu has drinks for one or huge fish bowls for the entire group to share and they are all tasty.  Even better-razzoo's is in the parking lot of the movie theater so drinks and a movie without driving :).   Hope you enjoy & happy yelping :)"}
{"text":"Too good to be true. If you like seafood and Cajun, this is the place to be. Right in front of the outlet. I tried gator meat for the first time there and when I say it was odd the chain. I'm been eating gator since I left. Service is A-1 as well. Don't forget to get yourself a \"Gator Punch\" which is made in a mason jar."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Server was a little annoying. Must have asked us 10 times if we were ok still. Even though we only had drinks."}
{"text":"I always noticed large crowds after coming from Concord Mills Mall. People usually don't stand in long lines for trash food so I assumed their food must be awesome.  We always said we were going to stop in and Saturday we finally gave it a shot. They cater to Cajun seafood dishes. I ordered the 'Nice cat filet' which came with blackened catfish wild rice and corn. The food was decent a little bit more spicy than I prefer but overall I feel like you get a decent portion for a decent price."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that the food must be Out Of This World because the customer service and the cleanliness of the place is absolutely horrendous! My husband and I walk in, I smile and say \"Hello\" and the hostess says nothing. There's a brief and awkward silence while she grabs two menus and then says in response to my \"Hello\", \"Just two?\". We begin to follow her to a booth and the scene on the way was unreal. The place is SO dirty and nasty. There were napkins, straw paper, stains and food on the floors. Several booths were piled high with food and plates left from previous patrons. She presents our booth with a wave of her hand and says \"right here\". I look at the food on the table, on the seats and on the floor in astonishment because the hostess seemed to think this was acceptable. She made no motion to clean it, apologize...nothing. I ask if there's somewhere else that we can sit that is cleaner and her response is NOTHING. She steps about three feet away to another booth and says \"this one\". I thought I was being punked lol. I take one last glance around the place and again; complete FILTH. I say to the hostess, \"We can't eat here. This place is filthy.\" and again she says NOTHING. She just stared at us lol We show ourselves out while walking over paper and food mashed into the carpet and we will NEVER be back again. Once again, the food must be delicious and/or cheap for people to be willing to dine where I wouldn't eat for free. If cleanliness and customer service matter to you, save yourself a trip. If the possibility of good food, poor customer service, food mashed into the bottom of your shoes and a stomach bug won't deter you then have at it!"}
{"text":"Lunch today at Razzoo's was pretty good. The place was practically empty, our waitress promptly got our drink & appetizer orders. If you've never been there the menu can be confusing,  the waitress offered NO suggestions & never mentioned any special. The appetizer (boudin balls) came out quickly and was good. Waitress got our orders and we did not see her again until our food came (ten minutes later) I needed napkins and a refill in water but the waitress only came back when she brought the bill.  I had the shrimp po boy and it was delicious,  my husband had the gator tail and said it was ok. For the place to be so empty I think the waitress could've been more attentive."}
{"text":"I always come here when we they have crawfish in season. But all of their other dishes are great too. Tonight the service was a little off, but all in all dinner was still great as always."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant,  too bad I live about an hour and a half away,  so we only eat here for special occasions. The food here is excellent. My favorites include the crawlfish fondue dip., crawl fish etoufee, the jalapeño catfish. I have never had anything here I didn't love. We have always had great service at razzoos except one time.  It was extremely busy and I think our waiter was new. The manager came and apologized for everything being so slow. Other than that I would say razzoos is perfect!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Razoo's. We've always experienced great food and excellent service. Razoo's also has great lunch specials too. If you enjoy po' boy sandwiches, stop by for lunch on Tuesdays, you can order a po' boy sandwich, side, and a drink for just $7.00! The po' boy sandwiches are huge with generous portions of shrimp. If you are looking for good Cajun food. Stop by and give Razoo's a try."}
{"text":"I love razzoos! Charlotte doesn't have enough Cajun restaurants, however Razzoos always fixes my cravings. I never had anything i didn't love. Anything \"stuffed\" you would want to try!! Be adventurous and get the gator! Be fun and get the fishbowl( alcoholic drink enough for 4 to share). This is an above $10 for an entree kind of place, but def worth!"}
{"text":"Rat toes and fried pickles are the best thing on the menu. The rest is meh! I was disappointed in the flavor of all 3 dishes my family ordered. I had the shrimp Creole which had little flavor, my step-son had the shrimp and catfish platter. The fries were soggy and the hushpuppies were bland and my husband had the adoli sausage w/ red beans and rice which was also bland.  Order the fried food because that's the best flavor.  Next time I'll just stop for appetizers."}
{"text":"We love this place!! My husband and I visited New Orleans last Feb. and this place is quite authentic!! Lots of fired food but that's the best part. I had the fried catfish and shrimp basket and it was very good. My husband had the fried craw fish and the dip that came with it was very good. Almost like a bar b que but with a little something extra. Definitely worth the try. We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte, I had to find a unique eating place that has shrimp, and beans and rice!   Razzoo's has it all!  I has the shrimp and red beans and rice, it was such a delightful meal.  Everything I had was so spicy and good...the hush puppies were very spicy, But I managed to eat them.  Along with the waitress, Makayla she made our dining experience so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Really good!!!  I read about Razzo's on Yelp and although I had visited the Mall area, never noticed this rather colorful eatery.  My husband and I decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. We noticed the busyness upon our arrival and thought it would be a long wait to be seated. I got out of the car while he parked. To my surprise we could be seated right away. I studied the fish pond while I waited on my husband's arrival. We were seated promptly and attended to by our wait staff. Received great recommendations for drinks then ordered. My husband chose the ribs and I chose the stuffed shrimp. Dee-lish all the way...I got their Peach Bread Pudding to go and it was scrumptious. I actually had some the following day. It seems we got n just in a nick of time because as we were leaving we noticed it to be much more crowded. Family type environment. We will be back..."}
{"text":"I really like Razzoo's but there are a few things they could do to make it better. We always start out with the hot and delicious fried pickles but are always in need of more spicy ranch dipping sauce.  You can't really go wrong with what you order on the menu. Everything is good. I especially like the shrimp en brochette.  The dirty rice and green beans are also on point. My biggest complaint is actually their beer prices. $5.50 for a 14 oz. draft is steep. Why not have a daily drink special? My other main complaint was the fact that our waitress was on \"break\" and the nice girl covering for her had too many tables to be acceptably effective.  I had to grab another table's waitress as she whizzed by in order to get another beer. Apparently they were also on \"shift change\" at 5 p.m. so this caused a delay as well. If they tightened up these two areas, Razzoo's would easily be a 5 star spot."}
{"text":"**Service (3/5): well-meaning chain-dining from start to finish. **Food (2/5): my kids tried aligator and crawfish and thought they were fine. Why? They both just tasted like chicken nuggets. Raw oysters poor (shame on us), everything else lackluster."}
{"text":"Delicious. I love Cajun food, and this place doesn't disappoint. The food is good. The flavored tea is delicious. The atmosphere is a little cheesy - too much effort out toward looking like The Bayou, but I get it. However, there's a bar and multiple TVs, so it's perfect for game day."}
{"text":"The stuffed fish is unbelievable.  Stuffed with shrimp and crab and topped with a crawfish sauce. And the Peach Mambo is very refreshing...and made with real peaches."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday. Ordered grilled gator tail and stuffed fish w shrimp and crab . Food experience was different. I thought foods were great. Servers and whole management was really nice. Definitely going there again. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was alright but I've had better alligator elsewhere. The place is a madhouse and the service is slow. Outside, you'll usually find smokers young and old so expect to hold your breathe as you enter. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! So delicious that I didn't even get a pic bc I was ready to dig in! I had the Shrimp Poboy w/ seasoned fries & hush puppies. My husband had a Shrimp & Catfish Poboy w/ the same sides as I had. My oldest son had chicken wings OMG they were fried to perfection."}
{"text":"NO MORE GATOR TAIL?!?!?!?! I used to love this place, their drinks were awesome, food is great, and the price isn't bad.  Now I have been informed they no longer will get gator tail.  No gator tail means i will not go back bummer"}
{"text":"Me and my friend enjoyed dining here tonight. Our sever was very friendly and did a great job waiting on us. The drinks and food were a good portion. All of the seafood we got were  seasoned just right and very delicious! I also enjoyed the good blues music. Good food, Good service, Good atmosphere.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"This is the lone NC outpost of this 17 unit chain that got its start in Dallas, TX.  Razzoos provides your typical casual dining experience in décor, service, and food quality, but with a Cajun twist.  Our server was fun loving with a good knowledge of the restaurant's beer selection.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, seated immediately, and our order was taken soon after.  We started with the Alligator appetizer.  As many others have mentioned, this item is not on the menu, but is very popular.  It consists of fried breaded bits of alligator (about the size of popcorn chicken) served with a few French fries in a basket.  It comes with a spicy cocktail sauce to dip.  The server suggested that I order the crawfish etouffee and I was not disappointed.  A generous portion of shelled crawfish are covered with a spicy brown roux sauce with a mountain of moist dirty rice in the middle.  Adding some of the hot sauce from the table made it just the right temperature.  If you find yourself by the mall, but don't want to try the same old boring chain, check out Razzoo's.  It won't be an authentic Cajun experience, but it will be delicious and who has time to go to New Orleans anyway?"}
{"text":"I used to frequently visit Razoo's in Alpharetta GA but they closed down.  I was so happy to see one in Concord on a recent business trip to the area.  I had to get my fix of Rat Toes and Crawfish Etoufee.  It was just as I remembered....delicious!  Great staff also."}
{"text":"We had high hopes when we entered the restaurant.  The decor was over the top, but fun.  Unfortunately, this place was a disappointment after eating in Louisiana!  The seafood gumbo, or as the menu called it gumbeaux, was not very good.  One of my sons had the crawfish tails and he seemed to like them, but my other son ordered the seafood platter and 6 hours later he was violently ill.  Delightful.  We will not be going to Razoo's Cajun Cafe ever again."}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere here. I had the alligator and shrimp piquant. It was so good, and spicy. I love spicy. It was one of their gluten free options."}
{"text":"WIsh I could give 3.5 stars. Its pretty good but not great. I will definitely go back but I think that is more due to the lack of options for Cajun cuisine that the food itself at Razoos."}
{"text":"We had a good, fun time here after driving to and from Seagrove, NC.  It had been a hot, sunny day and we drove topless, so we were wind blown and sun kissed.  There was a glut of traffic all about Concord Mills Mall and the Concord Raceway lives there so there must have been a race that day.  Ugh!  We had Yelped restaurants and came up with Razzoo's.  Great choice. Cajun theme, large and many people.  Wait time was a bit more than 40 minutes, but we were hungry, needed a driving break and decided that good or bad, we were eating here.  Glad we did as the wait staff were helpful, friendly, relaxed and pleasant.  We ordered Swamp Things (really!) that were a frozen cocktail in tall hurricane glasses.  Welcome to our parched throats they were.  I ordered oysters and they were very good.  My happiness factor was rising.  Lots of fried offerings, Cajun style, so off we went with a chicken dipper basket and I a catfish platter.  Needless to say, we could not finish either as the portions were starving man generous.  It was perfectly cooked and tasty.  We live a good hour away, so unless we are on the road would be unlikey to return soon, but that said, if you are passing through Concord or going to one of the races on the schedule, come and enjoy.  You get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"Great place. Fun atmosphere. Jumping on a Saturday night. We went there to meet a friend I hadn't seen in 5 years, and it was an excellent night. Food was tasty; shrimp Creole, fried shrimp, and fried okra. All was hot and fresh and very good. Wish the lemonade was house made, but you can't have everything. Kudos to Hunter, our server. She was peppy, friendly and efficient. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If I hadn't been born in Louisiana and my family wasn't cajun, I probably could enjoy it.  But when I go to a place that claims to be cajun and I see only pale shadows of the dishes, I come away disappointed.  This place seems more about the Look of what a non-cajun would expect out of cajuns than what being Acadian really is.  Nowhere to be seen is the wonderful dishes like maquechoux, and boudin, nor were the sides near what I like.  At least I still have relatives from Lafayette who send me good sausage to cook my own jambalaya and gumbo the right way."}
{"text":"Cajun 2 ways GREAT! Enjoy the fish bowl when I'm not driving. Boo had the gator and ate every place."}
{"text":"This was so great!! The food, the drinks and the service = A+!!! Try the Peach Mambo (comes with peach slices) and the crawfish (corn, potatoes and deliciousness)."}
{"text":"Best restaurant around the Mall.  Love it, Love it, Love it.  A trip to the mall, Bass Pro Shops, Dave and Busters and finish the day with some good food and great atmosphere at Razzoos.  You've probably seen the reviews of the food being spicey.  Their not lying.  But you can ask for some of it a little less spicey.  I personally don't think it's that bad, just warm.  My favorite is the \"combo skillet\" pass on the shrimp creole and replace it with a double crawfish etouffee.  Pretty waitresses, short shorts, cold beer, good upbeat music, very interesting interior decor.  Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"When I want fried everything, especially catfish, I head to Razzoo's.  I really enjoy the catfish and shrimp platter.  I have also had the tchopotoulis (sp?) which is a chicken dish that's very good.  if you are headed here for gator tail, a dish they're well known for, call ahead.  On our last visit our very nice waitress informed us that there's currently a shortage from the farms who supply this unique meat.  It's very good, by the way, a little like a cross between chicken and shrimp.    As others have already mentioned, it's a lively atmosphere, neat decor, and a fun menu.  They also have some interesting mixed drinks.  Portions are big, so be prepared to leave with something to take home.  Laissez les bon temps rouler!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Went here for dinner while staying at the Great Wolfe Lodge and was not disappointed.  The fried green beans were perfect, gator punch was awesome and my chicken entree was full of flavor.  Our server was very attentive and knowledgable.  Can't wait for one of these to open in Raleigh next year!"}
{"text":"Let Me tell you about the OMG experience we had at Razzoo's...we happen to come at the right time when they had crawfish at 12.99 per pound and did i mention we had 6 pounds..yep folks 3 a piece.   The crawfish, potatoes and corn were cooked perfectly and spicy. They were so good that we couldn't stop eating them. And the cocktails that we had were perfect for the low country boil in front of us. My friend and I had the peach cooler and the watermelon cooler made with vodka. I hope to go again before I leave town."}
{"text":"Sh*t y'all, I'll just go ahead and say it: this is probably as good as it gets for Concord. Here's why I'm giving Razzoo's 5 stars.  1 - Our server Casey was awesome! (Kasey? Kasie? Sorry babe if I spelled your name wrong!) Anyways she was super sweet and the epitome of Southern hospitality. Honey if you're reading this we totally saw you at TGIFriday's the next night and if you were of legal drinking age we would've bought you a beer! Next time, come say hi :)  2 - The food was delicious. Crawfish tails, shrimp, crab, tilapia, you name it. All my favorite Southern seafood items were on the menu.  3 - Ambiance. Just the right amount of kitsch, decent playlist, fun bar scene...not quite NOLA but still neat.  4 - The local beers on tap! We tried ales native to North Carolina and while I can't remember what we had exactly they were tasty  5 - Okay y'all now this is the kicker. Because it was a Friday night in Concord with limited options to party, there were a bunch of folks at Razzoo's drinking fishbowls. Apparently some young woman over-imbibed and proceeded to puke not just in one or two, but across ALL the bathroom stalls' floors. When I went to the bathroom, some of the staff were dousing it in bleach, so 5 stars for cleanliness!   Thus, Razzoo's is as good as it gets. For a Friday night before a day at the track, I think even Ricky Bobby would get down here!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! The food was on the spicy side but we should have expected that haha. We had the stuffed shrimp, bacon burger, and fried platter, and it was all great! We started off with \"rat toes\" and the server warned me that they were very spicy..well I didn't listen! They were all ate but they are not for the faint of heart! Not sure about the other drinks on the menu but the Long Islands were very strong!!:)"}
{"text":"Great, authentic food. Fun atmosphere! Service was fast and drinks wore good!  There was a little wait so would get there early for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food, service atmosphere.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  We tried several different things and they were all very very good and authentic."}
{"text":"Large selection of Cajun/creole style dishes. Should be able to something for everyone in your party. I went on the week so it wasn't that busy but the service is great and everyone was very friendly. Food has great flavor. If your looking for really spicy Cajun, I don't know if they will accommodate you but there is enough spice to give good flavor and not bland."}
{"text":"I won't lie, it isn't like what you'd get in New Orleans, but it's pretty good cajun/creole for NC. The gumbo was decent, the shrimp etoufee was solid. I like it hot, and it wasn't hot enough to give 5 stars, I'd bring my \"Slap Ya Mama\" seasoning next time haha! But it worked for me, I'd recommend it to others, YMMV"}
{"text":"Carry out only review, but it exceeded my expectations. Got the Cajun Combo Skillet for the Mrs. and I to split and it was ample for our dining needs. It came with a long sliced of Andouille sausage, a tasty shrimp creole, tender and nicely spiced craw-fish etoufee, HOT red beanz 'n' rice (my favorite!), a bite sized ear of corn, and a slice of hot french bread.  The to-go orders are picked up at the bar and the food is sectioned out so most items are kept separated. The server opened the container and asked that we check it before leaving to ensure it was as it should be, and then bagged it and gave my 5-year old granddaughter a neckful of beads to wear out!  When we got the food home it was still hot and excellent Cajun cuisine. The prices were very reasonable, the serving sizes fair, and the service for us was excellent. Will definitely come back when we return to the area."}
{"text":"Being from the gulf coast, New Orleans used to only be a couple hours from me. It is my favorite city. I know we are in NC but I did have reasonable expectations for this restaurant. The catfish poboy was really good. Great fish taste and bug serving of filets. The bread was soft and tasty. It was a bit dry though...and I would love to see a fried oyster or roast beef po boy on the menu eventually! My husband got the jambalaya pasta (or Cajun pasta? I can't remember the name.). It was tasty but for having seafood and meat in it...it was one note of flavor. He could only taste the sauce and not all those fantastic ingredients. Needless to say...I had to share my po boy with him since he had order envy. The inside is festive and I love the bead chandeliers...and the Abita signs and hurricane on the menu! I didn't get to try the hurricane mix but once I have this baby I'll be grading that...because that is something you definitely need to get right if you're going for a NOLA theme!"}
{"text":"Everything is salty and the portions are HUGE along with the price. Always consistent but I feel like I always have eaten poorly ."}
{"text":"Big space, lots of seating.  If you like cajun or creole you might find what you like.  I went because my husband wanted to go there, so I was more challenged in finding something I'd like that wasn't fried and unhealthy.  I ended up with the fried shrimp po' boy.  It was okay.  My husband loved his meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good shrimp po boy, a little salty, but not unexpected at this place which fries about everything.  Looks like it could be fun at night."}
{"text":"We took a day trip down to Concord and decided to try Razzoo's. Great lunch spot but I wasn't blown away by the food. Has a fun and unique menu and the decor inside is so fun! I would try it again but not blown away by the food. Service was great."}
{"text":"Nice place with fun decor and a good atmosphere. No complaints about the service or cleanliness. The food came quickly and was hot and tasty. The spice level is a bit high but that's normal with Cajun cuisine. Overall would go back and it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My food was just ok but giving 4 stars because everything else about this place was 5 stars and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.   I love crawfish étouffée and wanted it badly but the waitress wasn't very convincing when I asked about it. My gut said not to order it but I couldn't resist. I settled on Cajun platter because it included the étouffée, along with shrimp creole, andouille sausage and red beans and rice. Plus bread and corn.   I'm not a fan of red beans and rice so they let me sub that with extra crawfish étouffée. Score!!! I was disappointed with it. :(. The étouffée was a little bland. I think it was the roux that was bland. I'm no food critic but I asked for salt and pepper which probably is unusual. There really was no spice or hotness. Bummer.   The andouille sausage was delicious however and the shrimp creole pretty tasty too. Those saved the dish for me. I was just hoping for the étouffée to knock my socks off and it didn't.   Everything else about this place is great. Service (I sat at bar), decor, music and beverage selection was spot on. I bet there are plenty of other food options that are great too so I plan to try something else next time. I'm just in town on business for one night but this is definitely on the list of places to try again."}
{"text":"I like this place more for the ambiance than the actual food. The food is ok- sometimes a little too heavy on the grease for my liking, but I guess that's how a lot of Cajun food is. If you're not big on greasy foods, the stuffed shrimp is great! You get about 10 shrimp on top of Cajun rice that are split and stuffed with crab meat, then are covered in a cream sauce. So good! I love the way the place is decorated and it really gets you in the mood for some fried okra and red beans and rice!   They have a lot of fun things on the drink menu, and two specialty \"beer 'ritas\" where they fix a drink and then serve it with a bottle of beer turned upside down in it. Those are my favorite. If you go with a group, the best one is to get the Gator Punch in a fishbowl. It has 6 different liquors and is served in a fishbowl with extra long straws for everyone. It's worth coming here just for that!"}
{"text":"I love Razzoo's, and I try to eat there once a week if i can.  My wife is a cajun cook and when she doesn't want to cook, or wants a taste of home, Razzoos is the best game in town.  Period.  This place has a really great mix of authentic cajun food, like crawfish étouffée, boudin balls, andouille, jambalaya and so on. They all taste great and are true to south western Louisiana style.  Just superb cajun chow.  They also have a ton of Creole and cajun/creole fusion dishes too. All of these are really good, and I especially like the tchoupitoulas and zydeco pasta. They are unique and well prepared dishes that offer something exotic, yet delicious to folks that want to try a low country treat.  Razzoo's offers a large menu of seafood and chicken dishes, as well as a few southern appetizers too. So there is something for everyone.  So, now that you know the food is good, i can brag on the staff and building a bit. As a chain, mostly located in Texas, they seem to be well funded and have built a large, clean, and uniquely themed restaurant that has a really cool, Louisiana feel. They have a large main dining room with a mix of tables and booths, with a lot of atmosphere. A smaller second dining room is more laid back and low key. They have a modest sized bar area if you want that, and a bit of outside seating too.  I have never had to wait too long for a table, which is awesome. The restrooms are always spotless and that is a big deal to me.  The staff is cool too. Every waiter or waitress I've had has been polite and always willing to talk expertly about the menu. They must have a pretty good training program. My drinks have never run dry and the food comes  out quick. The staff is also really cool about substituting or customizing orders too. So its always pleasant.  Overall, Razzoo's well earns a five star rating."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm!  I love to hit Razzoo's when I'm in Concord and fill up on the endless catfish & shrimp.  The hushpuppies are very good, too!  I'd heard good things about the deep-fried pickles but while I found the flavor to be ok, I thought they were too dried out to thoroughly enjoy.  I will say that I think my daughter had a hard time finding something she could enjoy (the kids menu was pretty lame).  They should incorporate some smaller portioned entrees for the kids and tone the seasoning down some because she can get canned spaghetti or frozen chicken strips anywhere."}
{"text":"My wife, my parents, and all my inlaw's threw a surprise birthday party for me here for my 30th birthday. I hadn't eaten here in almost 7 years so I was dying to try it. When we received our food, my wife had to send her food back because it was not prepared the way she had asked. My brother in law's food was cold, so we sent it back as well. When their food came back out, the manager came and apologized. My brother in law's food was fine. My wife's food was still not prepared correctly. The manager seemed to get a bit agitated bug quickly changed his tone and offered to bring her something else instead. She just decided to keep it and brought it home for me to eat at work the next day. The manager did however take care of our bills since we had problems with the food. The food was ok, but I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"So it was my first time in Charlotte...and we were searching for a place to eat after we went shopping at Concord Mills. We stumbled across Razzoo's Cajun Cafe which i had never heard of in my life. So me and my buddy opted to be adventurous that day and try something new.   We walked in and all I can say is its a very COLORFUL restaurant. We sat down at our booth and were handed menu's that had A lot of items on it.....it was just very busy.... some of the items were rat tails......gator tails....wierd stuff anywayz i opted for the shrimp po boy with jalapeno hush puppies. My friend ordered the blackened chicken pasta. I must say my Shrimp po boy was really good..the shrimp was nice and spicy. I tasted my friends pasta and it was really good also.  I asked the waiter were there any other razzoos in the world...and she said that the one we were at was the only one outside of texas that actually worked. So there's 12 of them in Texas...which explains why i've NEVER seen Razzoo's before."}
{"text":"I've visited twice and I've not been disappointed yet. Great service and awesome food. The flavor was mouth watering. I will return ."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner, unit was not very busy. Ordered wings and crawfish bites but ere bland and tasteless. Server was not very good as he forget my sides and got another diners sides incorrect. Étouffée was very good as was the jambalaya rice. Bread pudding was Luke ward and  mediocre at best. Will not return."}
{"text":"I am fairly new to NC. I am a huge foodie. I'm an even bigger fan when it comes to New Orleans. When my daughter graduated culinary school back in New England I gave her a trip to NOLA. Razzoos is great. My friend had fried shrimp. I had the fish and crawfish etouffe. Light, flavorful, satisfying and Adrien our waiter, totally professional and charming! Ask him how to make an old lady a margarita straight up. I'm pretty sure he knows quite well now!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at this restaurant. The first time was over 4 years ago for a business dinner, I ordered the Cajun chicken with mash & veggies. It was to die for not literally lol but it was wonders. This time I came yesterday on Father's day with a party of 7(including me). We started out with 2 Gator punch bowls which my sister recommend and I'm glad we did although we didn't receive our beads lol but it was ok because they didn't forget the main thing, the drinks btw it was huge and for only $12 can't beat that. We ordered appetizers which came out fast, the Crawfish fondue & shrimp fondue that came with Texas toast.  Boy oh boy was it good, a def must try. We waited it seems forever for our entree, tick tock, my dad said \"they must had  to go catch the fish first.\" Lol  I almost died, but it seemed that way. *****Bells & whistle's******* Finally, entree were in the house.  I ordered the stuffed fish on a bed of white rice and mash on the side with a Texas toast. Everything tasted wonderful once we received it. Fresh and nothing missing. Customer service was top notch from our server, I forgot his name. Although I didn't like the fact that they didn't keep a list of names or 1 name at least of your party and where they were seated, instead you have to walk around and look for them, that's a bit too much but hey it is what it is. Overall I had a great time and would def recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good with the exception of multiple bone chips on our ribs.  We had to remove 5 other 6 chips during dinner. They were not only located at the cut point (half racks). Maybe picked up from a cutting board.  Kind of ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Good food. I had the traditional combo skillet, crawfish, shrimp and sausage. Very good. Also had the gumbo which was also very good. Nice laid back atmosphere. Very busy on a Saturday night. Not much for a beer selection."}
{"text":"This place was good. The decor was ok. The food was ok. I was hoping they would have Maque Choux but they do not.   Nothing was spectacular about this place. Very chain like atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was decent but since it was a slow hour, 3pm, our server would disappear, and sit at another table eating with customers. Then, we were sat next to a table of servers from this restaurant that weren't working at the moment. All we heard was how this or that was f@$ked up about the restaurant. I heard more f-bombs during this meal than I've heard in the past year of living here. Bonus, they were loud as hell. It took all I had to not tell them to shut up!!! I ordered a po'boy and the breading on the shrimp was cornmeal, which was interesting. The hush puppies had tons of jalapeños which were a bit too hot. The boiled crawfish were awesome though!!!!! Also, the green beans with the mustard sauce were great!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for my birthday today. The food was GREAT!!!  The place is very clean  our server was great.  After we ate the manager came by our table to see how our food was.  He spent 15 minuets with us.  Try this restaurant it's great"}
{"text":"Went here this pass weekend. It was really good. The waiters were very helpful and knowledgeable on the menu. Nice family style atmosphere. The food was great. We had the Creamy Cajun Crawfish fondue dip for an appetizer, and stuffed shrimp and stuffed fish for our dinner plates, which all was really...really good lol. You cant go wrong with this place. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat alone and be sad. The food here tastes like they just sort of threw it together."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service with good food. Despite there being a pretty large crowd at the restaurant, we were seated very quickly.   I ordered the Cajun 2-Ways with crawfish, and it was very good. The crawfish were fried very well and the etoufee was well-seasoned with a little zing. As an appetizer, we ordered the grilled gator; it was well-prepared and came with a sauce that was slightly spicy."}
{"text":"Tried the place out while visiting Charlotte. Family and I wanted to try something that's not in our home town, Augusta, Ga.   I have to say not only was the food Amazing but service was great to. I would recommend this place to anyone whom loves seafood. Also recommend to try the gator it was delicious.  Definitely have to return when we decide to visit again."}
{"text":"One of the very first places we tried upon our arrival to NC and we couldn't have been happier! They greet their customers at the door, and are very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is big with plenty of seating and the decor is intriguing.   Their menu leans towards New Orleans fixin's and they do not disappoint. Both visits have been enjoyable and we plan on being regulars. I highly recommend the Cajun Fried Chicken w/ mash and do not ignore the delicious piece of French bread on your plate.   Their Cajun Combo Skillet is good, but VERY spicy for our taste. It's also a hearty dish that two can easily enjoy. They have amazing sweet tea along with many other alcoholic beverages. Of course we couldn't leave without trying dessert so we chose their Bread Pudding which was excellent! The only negative is it doesn't come with ice cream.   This is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"The greatest Cajun food in the east coast literally bought the taste of New Orleans to North Carolina the food is great and a must taste if you are in the area my friend took me there when I visited her from Jersey straight edible crack"}
{"text":"This place has become a second home to me!!!! The staff knows me by name and drink lol! The worm burner is my go to drink even though it's no longer on the drink menu. First timers should try the chargrilled oysters gator tails and the gator punch in a fish bowl! Go hard or go home!  The shrimp and grits are a new menu item and has become one of my favorite dishes here! Crawfish are season items so whenever they have them I'm sure to order them and don't be afraid to ask for extra seasoning.   Mike the manager was tentative and gracious. The staff was awesome as usual. If your in the Concord area or want to try the closet thing to cajun cuisine in the Carolinas check out Razoos!"}
{"text":"First time stopping by. The atmosphere was amazing! When we first pulled in the parking lot I figured it would be a long wait because the parking lot was PACKED! We went in and the hostess said 20 mins. We actually waited 6 mins before being called(First plus). Our waitress was amazing (girl with short blonde hair and glasses). Made great recommendations. I ordered the stuffed shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the Cajun skillet. We order \"Rat toes\" for an appetizer and I also ordered a watermelon alcoholic drink- which was HUGE. Came in a 32oz mason jar for only $8! EVERYTHING exceeded my expectations. Excited to visit again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I along with my Five year old went to Razzoo's on 06/14/2015.  In the past I have loved this place! We always get the cheese fondue and I love the blackened chicken pasta.  This time hubby even ordered the shrimp pasta. The waitress was great and the restaurant is so colorful! We ordered our selections and waited. Now we waited for a good twenty minutes or so.  I normally don't mind because the food is amazing.  This time it was horrible!! When our waitress brought our food out I could tell right away something wasn't right.  There was so much grease in the bowl I refused to eat it. I called the waitress over and told her what was going on. She offered to get the Manager.  Once he got to the table he knew Immediately what was wrong.  They used the Alfredo sauce from the night before for the meal that I ordered.  This was not at eleven in the morning. We went at two in the afternoon. ANYONE that has ever made Alfredo sauce knows not to do that. The butter, cheese and cream separate.  He did apologize and offered to make us something different. I told him I did't want anything else but a promise to Quit doing that! I will try again but if I get anything like that served from the Kitchen that is it!"}
{"text":"Razzoo's easily one of my favorite places to eat. There's honestly nothing you could say bad about this place. My fiance talked me into trying the place a few years ago and I am obsessed. I've tried a bunch of diffent plates from the menu and it was perfection every time. Great for birthdays, get togethers, or even a date night. Outstanding cajun cuisine and feels like you're in New Orleans. Excellent service as well. Concord, NC"}
{"text":"Let's begin with the fact that I am NOT a seafood lover, so nothing will be over the top for me. However, I had a craving for fish, and due to yelp reviews, Razzoo's won. Marley was our waitress. Girlie is ON her game!! Chicago native, Charlotte transplant, and she knows the product she serves. LOVED her demeanor and how she readily educated my boyfriend and I on the good, great, and \"OH! U wanna try this!! of Razzoo's. Will the place see me weekly? No...(read the first sentence, again.) Will I choose them when I'm craving something fishy? Yes. Clean, pleasant atmoshpere, great service, and close by home = WINNER WINNER tilapia dinner!!! :)"}
{"text":"We had the seafood platter. We also ordered some wings as a starter. The wings were supposed to be spicy but there was no spice there at all. The seafood platter was ok the 3 hush puppies they gave us were good, but at the end of the day it was just another fried platter, which is what we order so... Now, the bread pudding, that's another story all together! oh my it was so good! If I ever get to visit this place again it will be just for the bread pudding. Yum! Three stars, saved by the pudding!"}
{"text":"I love Razoo's! Having attended graduate school in Hattiesburg, MS, I had grown accustomed to authentic Cajun food. Razoo's is pretty close, along with Cajun Queen and Beudreaux 's. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Good place for some Cajun food!  Location - far... Far in Concord :(  Food - we came here for some crawfish, they call it craw daddies here. The seasoning is good, not the greatest.. But! Good enough for my husband and I to come back for some more. I just enhance the flavor of our crawfish with my homemade dipping sauce (mayo, squeeze in some fresh lemon, and their Cajun seasoning). Had a side of fried okras which were yummy. The big hype about the rat toes where okay, not my thing. My husband on the other hand liked it.   Service - James, our waiter was cool. He took good care of us.   Place - Cajun-y! It's like a Cajun shack restaurant, or more so, it is."}
{"text":"Things I like: big menu, great service, BIG portions, fun interior, new/weird/funky dishes to try (alligator tail, fried pickles...) popular place to eat.   This restaurant fits all of these descriptions. Now if only the prices were a little bit lower..."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Charlotte we HAVE to come to Razzoo's!   Our favorite dish is the stuffed fish - its grilled tilapia over dressing and rice with a cream sauce on top.  The green beans are also tasty and the French bread is always buttery and delish!  We also tried gator tails which tasted almost like chicken - will be back again and again - service is ALWAYS excellent & attentive!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was poor. Thanks for the free gator punch. Went for a early dinner under staffed managers at bar. One waitress had kids at bar while she worked the other waitress was running everything poor service was unexpected. 1st and last visit. Outstanding food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to eat at. Have never had a bad experience here. The Cajun fried chicken is my go to, as everything on the menu is perfect. Even for people who don't like spicy things, there are options for you as well. Service, atmosphere, and food all Excel."}
{"text":"This place had consistent food, all measuring good to great. Waitress was attentive, courteous, and happy. Surprising overall considering it is a chain. And open until 11 on weekends, later than alot of places around."}
{"text":"I used to work here and i want the people who don't like spicy/seafood to know that THERE IS AN OPTION FOR YOU!!! Tchoputulas (pretty sure that's how you spell it) but it's a chicken dish, with potatoes, lemon butter sauce, and the veggie or the day. But the regular Cajun food is very good too!!!!"}
{"text":"Only location outside Texas. That's why we had to stop here after the Texans/Panthers football game. Wanted a meal we could get back home. Everything was fantastic! Gator and Crawfish were on point. Service was fantastic as well. If you are in Concord, NC and was a Cajun treat stop at Razoo's."}
{"text":"This seems to be a chain style restaurant but I was very impressed. We ate the crawfish étouffée and Cajun sampler. Good tastes and distinct flavors. Beware a lot of the dishes are spicy. We also did a starter of raw oysters which were surprisingly salty despite having hailed from Alabama. Good choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ate here once to try something new and I left feeling a little sick... This place is fried food HEAVEN, so if that's you're thing, you'll be more satisfied than I was! It's hard to expect more from a restaurant off of the mall (Concord Mills), because I understand they need to churn people in and out, but the menu was just too funky (lots of sauces and again FRIED food). I haven't been back since dining almost 2 years ago."}
{"text":"Great food and staff. This is very close to a true local Louisiana restaurant. The bar had great drinks."}
{"text":"I lovedddd everything about Razzoo's... I had been feening to dine at this restaurant to try the famous fondue dip and boy was it worth the wait. I had intended on trying the crawfish fondue but opted for the shrimp when the host mentioned how it was a house favorite....she wasn't kidding....the flavors were amazing not overly spicy and paired with this incredible garlic toast... my entree which was stuffed crab shrimp served with rice and a sided...I tried the jalapeño hush puppies all for a whopping $14 I was beyond pleased... it came with 8 large shrimp and they were beyond generous with the serving size.... loveddddd  everything...looking for Louisiana cuisine and your in Concord... Razzoo's is your spot...hands down"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars but someone tripped with the Cajun seasoning and spilled it all over my Stuffed Shrimp. The stuffed shrimp was good but to spicy for me (I was told that wasn't the norm). My hubby had fish that he enjoyed. I also had a peach mason jar drink from the bar I was huge and I couldn't finish it. All in all a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Good place to go. We ate after spending time at the mall and it was a good choice. The mall on Saturday though was a ver bad choice."}
{"text":"Awesome menu! Food is so flavorful and robust. Love the staff and the wait times. Never too long and always pleasant."}
{"text":"It was ok I had a taste for Gumbo but it didn't hit the spot.  The red beans and rice was delist.  I was not able to sit and dine but the customer services was good."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and usually don't like places like this but I always just get the blackened chicken and shrimp pasta without the chicken and shrimp and it is soooo good! Everyone I know always loves their food as well so I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere in this place. The menu is a plenty. However, I wasn't too impressed with the food. It just seemed like everything was fried and what Cajun place doesn't serve Jambalaya??? They had a jambalaya pasta...uhhhhhh....not the same. If anything, definitely try the fried pickles and gator tale. Those were pretty good. I only gave it three stars because it didn't seem \"Cajun\" enough. I like my creole food SPICEY..."}
{"text":"My wife, adult son, and I decided to try Razzoo's based on the mostly positive comments here. It did not live up to expectations.   We started with the Creamy Cajun Fondue Dip and raw oysters. The dip is essentially a shrimp bisque served with garlic bread. The Dip was excellent. The oysters, however were disappointingly small.  For entrées, my wife had Shrimp en Brochette and my son had Stuff'd Shrimp. Both were deemed to be very good. I had the Jambalaya Pasta; a real disappointment. I expected the pasta to be covered with a ladle full of \"zesty cream sauce,\"  instead I got a flavorless red sauce stuck to the penne in a way that reminded me of  pasta and sauce left overnight in the refrigerator.   Stay away from the oysters and pasta and you may get a very good meal."}
{"text":"Good food , nice service.   Enjoyed the shrimp creole.    Prices aren\"t cheap,  but worth it considering it's hard to find good cajun.    Food is more mild than super spocy that i've had at othwr cajun places so you might be poring on the hot sauce.  Nice non chain place in this area when passing through."}
{"text":"First time here. Besides the waiter taking a long time to get to us (almost 10 minutes) everything was great. We noticed a sign that said they had live crawfish but they told us they ran out (bummer)   We had the crawfish Queso dip, crab stuffed shrimp and crab stuff fish, SO DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Great place. Menu is awesome, goes with the atmosphere. Like all restaurants, minus a star for no local beer on draft. Mixed drinks place for sure."}
{"text":"Ok so I finally checked out Razoo's and I was NOT impressed and highly disappointed in my food. Yes I know, everyone talks about how amazing the food is, however tonight wasn't the case for me.   I ordered the shrimp pasta with veggies and though everything was cooked well, it had absolutely NO Flavor. Like none, the sauce smelled delicious and I was super excited to dive in. But when you have to LOAD your meal with salt just to taste better that's not good.   The chicken wings that were ordered for the appetizer was fried extremely hard. Like you barely had meat left due to how hard the chicken was Fried.  A friend of mine eats here faithfully, but I must say there's better Louisiana style restaurants in Charlotte with better tasting food than Razoo's."}
{"text":"Went two nights ago. Bar staff super friendly and the place is clean. Fried seafood was good. I deducted one star because either my dish had over cooked crawfish or the crawfish  were replaced by dried out chicken pieces."}
{"text":"Had lunch here during the week. We had 3 adults and two kids. It took at least 20 minutes to get our food. The fried pickles were heavily battered and super greasy. One adult ordered the alligator tail but only ate a few bites because it was also heavily battered and greasy. The mixed veggies that came with my meal tasted like reheated frozen veggies. We all had tummy aches after leaving. We won't be returning to this restaurant anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Love the crawfish fondue and Cajun skillet."}
{"text":"The spot is located near the Concord mills mall. The decor is Louisiana theme. It's a great place to get fried food and sweet drinks. I had the peach mambo. It was super large and primarily composed juice. I tasted sprite and the server noted they put it in the drink. I took a photo of the menu it notes only alcohol and juice in the drink. FYI they don't follow ingredients as listed. The drink wasn't strong simply  but a large container of juice. The app we got was good. I got the fried shrimp which lacked flavor and you needed the sauce to have flavor. The food is pretty filling. The service was fine. There is plenty of parking.this is a good lace to go if your drinking. I'm not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Good food but way to noisy to enjoy your meal. The wording on the menu is odd but you can figure it out."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We've lived in the are for years and finally stopped in to eat here the other day and we were very impressed. I ordered the stuffed shrimp and I thought it was amazing. My fiancé got the fried seafood platter and ate the entire plate! I thought the hush puppies he got were really good.  The only thing I didn't like was that we got there during shift change so we had a different server every time they came to our table. However, our drinks were still refilled in a timely manner, which is a big deal to us!   We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday last year I really didn't know what to expect but it was actually really good me and my friends enjoyed the food and drinks"}
{"text":"My favorite item here is the Creamy Cajun Fondue Dip with the Crawfish  and Buttered Toast ! Make you Wanna Slap Yo Mama ! So Good !"}
{"text":"I paid this place a visit after I finished my Christmas shopping in less than an hour, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The food and the service were both great. Seafood and Cajun food seems to be their thing and they do it right. Great place to go when you're in need of something different."}
{"text":"The Food and Service was out of this World!!! The Cajon fried shrimp was off the Hook"}
{"text":"I've been to Razzoo's twice. I love the Fish Ah Yee. Fried tilapia fish covered with creamy cajun shrimp & crab sauce, w/ rice & veggie d'jour. Yummy! Fried Pickle Puckers Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks good atmosphere great for family and friends. I just wish they had boudin but other than that is really delicious I usually order the Cajun combo skillet really delicious  I really recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"The good:  The corn on the cob is out of this world. The portions are very large, a lot of food for the money.  The ok: Overall the food was ok. Nothing (except the corn) is what I would consider above average.  The bad: The service we received was absolutely horrific. After we ordered it was ten minutes to get our drinks (water) and didn't have any the last ten minutes. We only got refills when we literally flagged a waitress down and asked for more. The waitress we had acted like it was an absolute bother to wait on us..."}
{"text":"Pop Quiz.  Razzo's is to Cajun as: a) Jackie Chan is to Academy Award b) Charlie Sheen is to sobriety c) Taco Bell is to Mexican d) all of the above  Answer: D This place is not really cajun, not even close. Just because you add heat to a dish and serve it burnt does not mean you are cajun or creole or low country. You want cajun, head to the Cajun Queen. You want a heavily decorated faux bayou experience, hit Razzo's and keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot.. even though it's in North Carolina, walking in to this place the atmosphere instantly changes. It's like I visited New Orleans for the evening. The service was great and the food was better. I ordered the seafood combo platter, and wasn't disappointed. Everything was so well seasoned! The shrimp were huge and the catfish was tender and moist. The hush puppies were a little spicy, but that didn't stop me from wolfing them down. Next time I am in North Carolina I will certainly make this one of my stops!"}
{"text":"Man this place was great. I ordered the jalapeño catfish and my girlfriend got a poboy, both were amazing."}
{"text":"First timer and it was pretty good!  The fried foods could use a bit more flavor but the portions are huge!  I had the shrimp  Po Boy, fried okra and the real  star was the hush puppies!!!! The hubby had the combo platter with crawfish and shrimp - the cherry  mustard sauce took it to the next level.   As an appetizer we had the fried pickles and they were delish!   We would definitely return for more.   Our waitress was very attentive,prompt and pleasant"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is great! But my fave is the crawfish dip, and the stuff'd fish with crawfish sauce! The bomb!"}
{"text":"Very consistent restaurant on the Chain Row in Concord! Out of all the area Concord Mills Chain Restaurants, THIS is the place to go!!!! Something for everyone, great managers willing to do whatever for whoever, very good food and equally as good service! I have never had a bad experience and if you do, just ask for help! You will be taken care of.   I have seen this with other patrons in my visits."}
{"text":"Yum! Loved it! We originally were supposed to be taking my mother out for a seafood dinner. Red Lobster is located near her but I wanted to try something new and different for seafood. After reading all of the reviews I got excited and decided to check this place out. At the last minute, my mother decided she didn't want to go out so my husband and I and our two sons decided to go out anyway. Upon entering, we were promptly greeted and seated. By the way, this was on a Sunday afternoon so I was not surprised that it wasn't too crowded. Our waitress was Patricia. She was very kind and attentive. She answered all of our questions and even offered suggestions since we this was our first visit. I ordered the stuffed fish and it was delicious. The portions were generous and everything came out piping hot. One of my sons ordered the stuffed shrimp and he really enjoyed it. There were generous portions of shrimp so much so that I got one, my husband grabbed one and my other son grabbed one off of his plate as well. My youngest son ordered the fried gator. We were all curious as to what this would taste like since none of us had ever had gator before. It was pretty good. He ate every last bite. The seasoned fries were very tasty as well - crispy and hot. Hubby got the seafood platter. There was so much food on his plate that yes, I snuck some of his food as well. For drinks, both of my boys just had water and I ordered the Bayou bliss. It had moscato, pineapple, peach and something else in it I can't remember but it was so good. It came in a huge mason jar and it was just right for the price. My husband just had the non-alcoholic strawberry lemonade. I don't know if it was good or not but he drink the whole thing so I guess it was. Our server was very attentive but did hover which I appreciated. I did not feel that she was rushing us out of the place. She got a good tip tonight. There were several items on the menu that looked so good and also by taking a peek at others tables nearby us I know that we will return to this place because I have to try out the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience with Razzoos. And I must say I was quite pleased. I went there after work. The food was amazing. The drinks were delicious. And the service was great. I ordered the fried shrimp and catfish combo and it was just way too much food for me. But the price was affordable. I truly did enjoy it. I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"It was great! We walked right in and were able to be sat immediately. Our waitress Jessica was very sweet & attentive. We had the craw fish appetizer with the cherry mustard. We weren't sure with something called \"cherry mustard\" if we would like it but it was delicious! For entrees I had the gator & my wife had the stuffed shrimp. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"New Orleans in Charlotte? Good Cajun dishes. Lots of fried stuff. The flavor can get lost in the fryer. The all you can eat catfish is the deal. It can be made grill or fried. Fun place."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's go to spot on the weekends. We loooove the gator. We have to order is every time we go. I have not had a bad item from here yet. The alcoholic drinks are good as well. Service is pretty speedy."}
{"text":"WOW. we're from out of town and found this on Yelp while visiting the Great Wolf Lodge. Holy crap! The food was amazing. The spicy chicken and sausage gumbo was fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place so much i dream about the rat toes which are jalapeños stuffed with crab and deep fried and it is so amazing i will crave it all the time and drive 30 min for these rat toes in fact I'm going to do it tomorrow because it's been too long seriously if u love jalapeños and crab or crab dip the rat toes are so freaking amazing their food everything is good to me the rat toes are my favorite but the stuffed shrimp is also a winner in my book this is just an amazing restaurant don't let the opportunity pass you by seriously"}
{"text":"I went to Concord, NC for a business trip recently and was at a loss when it came to dining options.  I stumbled upon Razzoo's and must say....I was pleasantly surprised.  From the gumbo to the rat toes to the seafood stuffed shrimp. It was all very good. Not healthy, but definitely tasty.  If you're in Concord, NC and want to try some local flavors, then check out Razzoo's. The service is very friendly and the environment is casual.  Kick back, relax, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Good foods. Drinks are always awesome. I live pretty far from this restaurant so to drive all the way to Concord Mills for some crawfish (bc I was craving some) was a big deal. But when we got there, they ran out. That was a bummer and I was really disappointed.  Now I learn to call ahead before trekking to this place.  :( made the trip out to the restaurant a failed. The crawfish here, the flavor is always on point and super spicy."}
{"text":"Love their jalapeño catfish dish. For a NC twist on Cajun recipes this place give a great effort. The ambiance is cute and typically little to no wait. The bar is also pretty dope."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! I've never been disappointed when visiting this establishment. I always get the shrimp and on my last visit I also got the brownie sundae and it was EVERYTHING :) well worth the calories."}
{"text":"Finally, I have found a spot that know the true meaning of using proper seasonings. I think I have drove pass this location maybe over 100x and never thought to go in and that changes today.   I ordered a half rack of ribs, which came with corn, bread and fries. The ribs were tender and the sauce they places on the side had a Cajun spice with a vinegar base. No complaints  My children ordered the gator basket with fries, this also came with very tasting hush puppies.   Now my daughter wanted to try the jambalaya pasta, this came with fish, crawfish, shrimp and sausage.  I'm allergic but I could see that they were not stingy with the meat.   Absolutely, no regrets and have officially added this place to my list. If you are looking for a place with awesome adult drinks, spicy and seasoned food and great atmosphere, this is it."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I've found that it's a bit challenging at times to find good seafood in Charlotte.   My first visit here I had the seafood combo platter. It hit the spot and I liked it very much.   More recently, my wife heard that they had live crawfish. We went for it and it was delicious. The crawfish gets 4 stars from me.   Overall I liked this place. The service was great. I like the decor inside and it's very casual. If you're craving catfish, shrimp, red beans, that sort of cuisine, you should check it out."}
{"text":"While visiting N.C., I was told the Concord mall area was a must see (pretty interesting!) and Razzoo's was a must try Cajun restaurant... but I think my Cajun expectations were too high.  The restaurant's decor was kitschy and vibe was relaxed, making me super excited to try some authentic savory Cajun food. First off, kudos on the drinks! The frozen swamp thang margarita and the peach mambo chiller were refreshing and truly delicious.  Then it started going downhill...With a party of 8, we ordered a variety of food but none of us thought anything was particularly well seasoned or delicious. Each dish also came with side of veggies that were essentially mushy peas.  Popcorn shrimp- a few scattered tiny shrimp over fries, all very bland.  Firemouth wings-advertised to be marinated in \"death\" sauce but even blander than the shrimp... we all doused it in hot sauce on the table.  Stuff'd fish- not bad but not sure what the fish was stuffed with, felt like miscellaneous things with muddled flavors.  Boudin stuff'd chicken- again, not bad but such a jumble of ingredients and all the sauce everywhere was extremely heavy; however, the mashed potatoes were amazing.  Shrimp en brochette- shrimp in bacon can't go wrong! And they didn't.  Gator tail- I've had gator before and had high expectations but this was just tough and flavorless.  Seafood combo platter- all fried seafood, but again can't go wrong deep frying things.  Cajun fried steak- the meat was a bit on the thin side but good breading and flavor; overall probably the table favorite.  Chicky dipper basket- fried chicken tenders were fine but nothing special.  As for the service, it wasn't busy in the restaurant but it was near impossible to find a waiter to get refills on sodas... I was hoping to see some genuine southern hospitality but that was yet another disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but slow wait staff. I was in the area and saw the cajun place close to our hotel and we decided to go there for dinner. The food was excellent, we had the gator tail, crawfish broil, grill tilapia and the jambalaya pasta. Everything was 5 star, except the fact that the wait staff was a bit slow. Overall great food"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a great place to eat. I'd give them 10 stars if I could, we've eaten here quite a few times and have never been disappointed, great food and an excellent staff makes this a MUST HAVE for us."}
{"text":"This place was nothing really to brag about the menus wasn't that extensive so I just  stuck with the fried shrimp.  The real  reason this place gets 3 stars is for the Gator Punch.  It's basically a fish bowl filled with alcohol and I was in love!!!   The Gator Punch comes in two variations one for 2 people and one for 4 people (you can only buy it for a pair or more boooooooooo).  All in all the drink was amazing and even between me and another person we both still had a good buzz.  Your best bet skip the food and come for the drinks, but make sure you have a DD always drink responsibly."}
{"text":"Lookin for taste of New Orleans, a taste of the Bayou or a meal made fresh with a touch of spice, Razzoo's is the place. My wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch and were glad we did. It was not quick, but it was good. The Hurricane Shrimp with the honey-pepper hurricane sauce was very good. I wish I had more of the sauce for the rice. The shrimp was lightly fried and sweet. My wife had the Zydeco Pasta with spicy shrimp and was quite pleased with her choice. The dishes were nicely spiced and filling. We definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"A lb of crawfish was $7.99 and included two potatoes and corn. The seasoning was pretty good and spicy. The crawfish were a little small. Service was really really friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Very good Cajun food. Just about everything is fried and greasy, but if you check the menu before you go, you know that up front.  Rat toes were delish- Boudin balls were good, but no taste of Boudin. Service was attentive and friendly. Took off one star for having ZERO healthy options available and food taking a very long time to come out."}
{"text":"Came in for an ADRL race at ZMAX for the weekend, and was SURROUNDED by chain restaurants.  This place did not sound familiar, so I read some reviews and decided to try it.  The food was definitely good...had the tricky fish and a side of red beans and rice.  Both were good.  The rats tails appetizer was awesome also.  Good solid cajun flavor for being so far away from cajun country."}
{"text":"I love the way the food is served in skillets, my food was mushy though, didn't care much for the flavor. We will be back to try the stuffed fish, just a great place to sit and look around :)"}
{"text":"The peach schnapps is awesome. And I hate  alcohol, but it's yummy. The rat toes are spicy, but awesome.  The servers are great. The ambience makes you feel like you're in the southern state. The food is great! I'm from out of town and ate here 3 days while in the city.  Five stars."}
{"text":"This is the only one of these restaurants in Charlotte. It's a hidden gem at the restaurants in from of the mall. Authentic Cajun style food. I drive 25 mins across town, just to come here. The fish bowl drinks are a special treat! I have taken my family when they come in town as well and they love it. one more thing. I didn't get it yesterday but the bread pudding is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We eat here every time we come through Concord!  I absolutely love Cajun cuisine and this place has fairly authentic recipes that are always cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  I can't give you a favorite meal, but the combo skillet w/ 4 different items is a great way to get a sampling of what they have to offer.  The crawfish étouffée is excellent as are the red beans and rice. Anything with andouille sausage is great.  And the gumbo is good as well!  Their wait staff are friendly and (usually) very attentive.  (We've never been when it's real busy.). Also, seasoned cheese fries w/ bacon and jalapeños and ranch dipping sauce is not on the menu, but you can order it and it's good!"}
{"text":"I had the seafood combo.  My wife had the shrimp gumbo.  All was good.  Got the half gator punch to share which is enough for a whole crowd (for like $12).  Great little fun spot to stop in.  Not gourmet food but has the New Orleans feel and great for a good time."}
{"text":"Razoo's is a casual dining Cajun style restaurant near concord mills mall.    My wife and I have eaten here several times.  When we pulled in we could tell the place was hopping as the back parking lot was full but finding a parking spot wasn't hard.  The place was crowded but we were seated right away.    Our waiter was efficient and friendly.  The menu has a plethora of Cajun style food and well as food for those who don't like spicy.  We ordered right away and my wife and I got the andouille sausage with red beans and rice.  A picture is posted.    The food was served hot with a slice of garlic toast.  The pic gives the impression the sausage was over done but that was not the case.  Must be a shadow.  The sausage was appropriately grilled and slightly charred to perfection.  The beans were creamy and perfectly seasoned.  The andouille sausage was delicious and perfectly spiced.  It does have some heat to it but not overly so.  It leaves a nice back-heat on your tongue.  We asked for additional garlic toast (you will too because it is delicious) and it was provided without any additional cost.    My wife and I honeymooned in New Orleans years ago.  Razoo's is as close as we have come to authentic Cajun cooking.  Give it a try, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Cool eclectic decor...a cross between Beverly Hillbillies and Swamp People. The menu is very entertaining to read. There is plenty of room between tables so you're not sitting on top of other people. For some reason, I wasn't to adventurous so I got the chopped salad with ranch dressing (had some cajun spices). It was delicious! My brother got the andioulle red beans and rice and devoured it. Hubs got the catfish poboy and had nothing but good things to say about it. (it was huge).  Biggest complement I can can give about this place was the service. We had an incredible waiter who was funny, informative and attentive.   I'll definitely go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"After leaving the mall last Saturday we went here for a late lunch/early dinner. We're new to charlotte so we wanted to try something \"local\" that wasn't a chain. And this place was great! The boudin balls were to die for. I had the jambalaya pasta and my boyfriend had the shrimp and catfish basket. All very good. My son had a corn dog-can't mess that up and he ate it all! The only downside was the drinks they were watered down but were kinda use to that. Overall great and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simply love this place... The ambience is good too... I like the jambalaya pasta... Every dish has its unique flavor to offer..."}
{"text":"In my quest to find the best salads near my office in Concord, went to Razzoo's today. It's in a string of corporate-type restaurants in front of Concord Mills mall. In spite of being a chain-like spot, I liked the Cajun theme, outdoor seating and Zydeco.  Ordered the chopped salad and it was very nice. The server said they make all their dressings in-house, so they get a star for that.   The salad was a mix of leaf and iceburg lettuce with cukes, tomatoes, carrots and bacon. The signature piece was fried onion strings on top, which I moved to the side and then ate a few as a tasty cheat.   Service, portion and price were good.   Adding this to my Best Salads in Charlotte list here on Yelp."}
{"text":"While I still enjoy the atmosphere of Razzoo's, something has changed.  I don't know if I'm older (okay, I know I'm older), or if they've cranked it up a few notches, but their food is now too much for us to eat, and I'm not talking about the price, which is about the same.  Everything on the menu, from the dirty rice to the fried green bean appetizer and the chicken pasta has a kick to it.  Consider yourself warned.  If you want it spicy, then this is probably your place.  But what used to be \"taste with a bit of a bite\" is now \"spice with very little taste\".  Or maybe it's just that there is so much spice that it kills the taste buds long enough to remove the taste.  Tough to say that there is a difference.  On the bright side, the place is fun, and the servers are as friendly as ever - it's just that the food has really gone downhill.  Sweet Tea Report:  Not sweet.  At all.  Not in your wildest dreams would you possibly imagine that this tea has ever even thought about being sweet.  I would hate to even try and think what their regular tea taste like because the sweet tea is so not sweet.  Move along."}
{"text":"We found this gem purely by luck. I am crazy about seafood and Cajun food and so happy these guys do it right. The inside of the restaurant might be a little too loud and touristy for some. By loud, I don't mean noisy, but more like bold and colorful in terms of the decor. Service is fast and courteous. For appetizers, I highly recommend the gator tail. It's listed as a \"seasonal\" item, but it really isn't seasonal, they have it at all times. They just list it as seasonal in case they don't get a supply of gator, which happened like, once in the past few years. The other really good appetizer to try is the rat toes. Unlike the gator tail, which really is the tail of an alligator, thankfully, the rat toes are not what they are called. They are jalapeños stuffed with shrimp and crab meat and then battered and deep fried. They are really good! Their shrimp po' boy is possibly the best po' boy I've ever had. It's loaded with shrimp (see photos) and so satisfying! We have also tried their \"gumbeaux\" (good ol' gumbo), Stuffd Shrimp Great (shrimp filled stuffed with crab meat, served over rice with a rich creamy sauce) and Shrimp En Brochette (bacon and jalapeño wrapped shrimp over dirty rice). They've all been really good. These guys also have an assortment of desserts and mixed drinks, none of which we have actually tried yet, but they look good, especially the Gator Punch (description from their menu -- \"killer trashcan drink with 6b liquors in a fish bowl\") -- and it really is HUGE! Overall a very nice, authentic Cajun place. We are totally in love with it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Saturday evening without a reservation. Overall I think it's a cool place, but the menu was a little challenging for me. The front of the menu was a cartoon and the actual menu text/font was a little too busy for my tastes. Once I got past that, I ordered the skillet which came with crawfish etoufee, shrimp creole, grilled andoulle sausage and boiled corn. I also ordered the 32 oz watermelon drink. I enjoyed my food and the drink was good, but almost too sweet. My husband ordered the shrip and catfish and didn't like the fries. They were hard and he described them as twice baked, he just didn't like them. While we were there, one of the servers had an incident and a drink landed on the customer. He was soaked, but seemed to be understanding. The manager came out and spoke to that table, the server sincerely apologized and they gave him a dry t-shirt to change into. I'm not sure if they covered his bill for the inconvenience, but they were very efficient and low key in handling the issue and I didn't see where any other tables were inconvenienced. I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The flavors are incredible! I highly recommend the Stuffed Fish, Stuffed Shrimp, Blackened Chicken Pasta, or Spicy Shrimp Pasta!  So Amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere, but they've continuously went up on their prices. Just doesn't seem worth it any longer. No reason why green beans, a piece of bread and small tilapia on rice should cost $14. That's a bit ridiculous. Unfortunately may be my last time visiting. Tricky Fish, my fav, went up an entire dollar in 1 month."}
{"text":"Food was good, one portion of my ribs were cold. Otherwise good experience. Service was awesome, waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant for Cajun food. The hush puppies here are great! Always leave here feeling full and satisfied. Drinks are sooo good! Definitely a great place to come for dinner or lunch"}
{"text":"Yay! So glad we chose this restaurant after careful deliberation and yelp reviews. It's a cajun atmosphere which I truly appreciated. Our waiter was very kind, attentive, and generous. He was also handsome if I might add. To the food...  Delicious, large potions and great prices. I got the shrimp po boy with cheese, fries and jalapeño hush pups. It was yummy for such a great price. Others got shrimp and catfish with fries and corn. Then we had delicious bread pudding that was savory! Soo good!  Overall terrific experience!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times now and it's been good both times. On the second visit, there was a mixup with my appetizer but they took care of the problem and took it off my bill. The alligator and fried crawfish are very good. The cherry mustard sauce is awesome. I've also had the stuffed shrimp and that was also very good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Razzoo's is a solid option overall. Great stuffed shrimp and stuffed fish among other cajun favorites, but some are better than others. The andouille for example is very good, but I've been unimpressed with the gumbo and the etouffee was very mediocre. Most of the food is good, however, although it doesn't taste like authentic Louisiana cajun food. The service is usually very friendly, wait times are average, and I've never had any significant complaints from eating here."}
{"text":"This place was to die for.  As recent Charlotte transplants from Houston where there is a great deal of Cajun food - we NEEDED this!  Every bite brought us back to Texas and New Orleans and we cannot wait to visit again.  My fiancé had a fried fish platter but I had the Cajun skillet and I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I thought the red beans and rice were the best part and I'm glad I saved my little roll until the end so I could sop up all the goodness still left in my skillet.  Next time we will definitely be ordering drinks - and maybe even some Abita beer from the tap! (A great Louisiana beer!)."}
{"text":"I've had pasta, crawfish, and the fishbowl both times I've been. Very good taste and portion size. I love the decorations and overall vibe of the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Po boys, fried chicken, gumbo and etoufee were all amazing. When the kids suggested we eat here again I didn't hesitate. Both times we were met with delicious food and prompt, friendly service. The drinks were just right, imo as well."}
{"text":"The food here was very very good and flavorful! I would definitely return. The atmosphere was fun and funky! If you want good cajun/creole food this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"**ppl with allergies and breastfeeding mamas**   I can't believe it's taken me a week to write this review because this place was so amazing! I have been there several times before with family and friends and the food is good, the drinks are good, and atmosphere is lively. However this last time was special and I need to give credit where it is due.   I'm a new mom who is breastfeeding and we recently found out our baby has a dairy protein intolerance. So I had to cut dairy from my diet completely...which is not as easy as it sounds cuz that sh*t is in everything! Anyway, eating out has become a super challenge, but since my dad was visiting from Cali we were eating out a lot this particular week. Earlier that day I had gone to Pisces in Mooresville and they were much less than accommodating...they really didn't seem to care. Then we came here for dinner...  When I informed my server of my issue she got the manager. He came to my table, went through each menu item with me to figure out what I could eat besides a salad. He was so helpful and didn't make me feel like I was an inconvenience. We settled on the Tchoupitoulas without the sauce (it's cooked in butta) and butter less corn...but I was totally cool with that because it beat the same ol plain ol salad. Then after my food came out, so did the manager with with their cherry mustard sauce (?)...he went out of his way to find a sauce that I could have! And it was delicious!   Seriously, hands down, the best customer service ever! Especially in contrast to the experience I'd had earlier that afternoon. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit . Once I Step in server help me about there menu. Then she gave me table and left another server came (Camille)and she ask me what do you Like. I replied I don't have much ideas about menu. She suggested me good appetiser , Entries and dessert. While my dinner she was keep asking me. Overall awesome experience. I will come here again n again."}
{"text":"Good food with a great staff.  The pricing is moderate.  This a great place to bring your family for a meal.  Everything seems to be fried here."}
{"text":"What a lovely little chain.  We came on a busy Saturday night and waited 10 minutes for a table. During our wait, we decided to peep the menu and found that they serve real alligator meat. I'm pretty adventurous when It comes to food but gator tail did not strike my fancy at all! The hostess overheard my kids and I talking and chimed in to recommend the fried gator tails. He said the meat is soaked in milk and pre-cooked before it's breaded and deep fried to remove any \"gamey\" taste. And the server could give a sample before committing to the dish, just in case we didn't like It. My son then reminded me how I convinced him to try frog legs once so I should take my own advice and try It. Darn kids and their memory!  We get seated and true to my word, I asked for a gator sample. The waitress brought out enough for our table of four to share. The verdict? TASTES LIKE CHICKEN! Ha ha Seriously- It tasted just like fried chicken tenders with a hint of Cajun spice. We ordered the full appetizer portion which surprisingly came with fries - pretty much a meal in itself. Yea, I'd order It again, probably on a salad next time.  The hubs and I each ordered the platter where you get crawfish ettoufee, shrimp gumbo and andouille sausage. The sausage was a tad dry and the shrimp wasn't great but the crawfish was delicious. It's by no means authentic here. Razzoos to Cajun is like Olive Garden to Italian. It's good enough.  The best part? They serve OMB Fat Boy. I think the hubs had a slight heart attack when he saw It on the draft menu. Most places in Charlotte have OMB Copper on draft - that's their most popular beer but the Hubs' fave is the Fat Boy (oh the irony!)"}
{"text":"I really love this place! They have great food and a fun atmosphere and the service is always good. The crawfish étouffée is my favorite, but there Cajun fried chicken is hard to miss! And if you haven't tried gator, try it here!"}
{"text":"decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good."}
{"text":"Previous to trying multiple menu items my update is strictly to correct myself. They do indeed have authentic cajun food available here"}
{"text":"pretty good food, the cajun pasta is my favorite! also, location is nice as its just outside the mall without mall pricing."}
{"text":"Great Service, we had a group of 9 and we agreed to be split-up and have nearby tables with the same waitress she was awesome.  Food was great very authentic made me feel like I was in Louisiana."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again! This was not our first time and the service has gotten worse with each visit. Today was the last straw. Once we got seated we waited 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken, but nobody ever came by! At that point we walked out, and nobody even noticed! Never again!"}
{"text":"Very spicy food  Good service nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. This is a fun place and they server good Cajun food. I tried the Cajun sampler so I could taste some different things. Only compliant was that there was too much food to eat it all, and I was out of town so I could not take my leftovers home."}
{"text":"Just had the chicken etoufee for lunch. wow! very good and a pleasant surprise.  Great flavor and generous portion. I've been here a few times and always enjoy the fun atmosphere too."}
{"text":"5stars only because our waiter was flipping awesome!!! His name was john and he's in school for business great great great! Sadly I dnt like hot food lol I'm not a spicy food eater at all. I tried it though, our appetizers were fried crawfish tails oh they were soooo good && fried shrimp!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I will probably never be back. EVERY restaurant around Concord Mills is crap and so we picked this one based on the reviews.... I wasn't too hungry so I got the soup/salad combo with the cobb salad and gumbo. Gross..the gumbo was disgusting!!! If you like your gumbo to taste like dark brown salty AF gravy, then you're in luck. I took two bites and pushed it away. The salad was a salad..nothing spectacular. It's a chain, corporate restaurant so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. The service was good and the place was clean so I gave it two stars. Don't expect anything above and beyond here."}
{"text":"Decent Cajun food at a descent price. What's not to like. Ordered one of the skillet options and it had a sampling of everything. Andouille sausage, shrimp etoufee, spicy etoufee and some smoky beans. Really enjoy it. Also enjoy the fried pickles. Our server was awesome and will probably return to try out their gator dinner."}
{"text":"In town visiting a friend for the weekend and she suggested we hit this spot. It was pretty good! Ordered the Catfish Po'Boy and it was so large I took two bites & boxed the rest for later. Also tried the Peach Mambo which was refreshing & delicious...well worth the $7.50!"}
{"text":"As much as I love spicy Cajun food, I just don't frequently dine at Cajun restaurants...possibly because there aren't too many Cajun varieties near me.  (I DO intend on changing that)  In the past year, for instance, I've only been to 2 Cajun restaurants - Cajun Yard Dog (next must-write review on my list) and Razzoo's.  I'll start with Razzoo's because it made a bigger impression (though I loved Cajun Yard Dog too).  First of all, this restaurant is located near the Concord Mills mall...very far from my home.  Still, it was well worth the drive.  The restaurant itself screamed \"Fun\" as soon as I stepped inside...and the menu lived up to its image.  Fun, vibrant, and extensive menu!  From all the tantalizing options, my greed got the best of me...and I opted for the man-sized \"Cajun Combo Skillet\".  Well, it was an excellent choice...and I loved every item in it (Andouille Sausage, Shrimp Creole, Crawfish Etoufee, Red Beans, Rice, Corn and Garlic Bread...I know, OMG!).  All Oh-So-Spicy Dee-Lish!  The service was quick and friendly...so no complaints there.  Although I sense that this restaurant may be a chain (and I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants), Razzoo's was thoroughly impressive...not just in its unique decor/presentation, but its one-of-a-kind menu, with perfectly seasoned and flavored foods!  If only there was a Razzoo's closer to where I live, I'd go regularly!"}
{"text":"We stopped by at Razzoo's Cajun Cafe for lunch the other day.  We were seated and placed our orders quickly.  Besides other food, 3 in our group ordered gumbo,  2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo. The food came out shortly after placing our orders.   It was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix-up on the gumbos.  The person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa.  As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was \"yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time\" .  WHAT?  Unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind.   Sorry, Razzoo's Cajun Cafe, this could have been a much better review since the food itself was actually fairly good, but this kind of mistake is inexcusable."}
{"text":"I was honestly surprised at how great the food was! Upon arrival I did not expect so much flavor to be in the restaurant, it really has a fun New Orleans feel to it. The service was great, all servers were kind, quick and helpful! The food was delicious when it arrived and I would recommend you try the fried okra if you get the chance."}
{"text":"First timer here, and I absolutely loved it. Their stuffed chicken and pasta is so good. Love that it's not too crowded, plus the restaurant is big also. The line wait to be seated for the restaurant is less than a minute! Would definitely recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"We are new in town and decided to give this place a try. Our waitress was super awesome! She is a college student and we loved chatting with her about her future plans. Beer was good, got a mason jar drink and it was huge and tasty however....needed a shot of vodka or something because i couldn't taste the alcohol. I told the waitress that i had a seafood allergy and the manager came by the table to discuss entree options with me [very nice service] I ended up choosing the boudin stuffed chicken, I asked for the chx blackened, and substituted the boudin sausage for andouille because i was informed that the boudin sausage has a seafood stock that they use. I would have never guessed that, so thank you to the manager!! My meal was Sooooo full of flavor!  That cheese sauce is great! The veggies and smashers were really good. Even the garlic bread was awesome. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened, but today will be my last visit. They no longer sell the fried catfish and shrimp all you can eat special. When I asked why I was told that it was an inconvenience for the staff. They had to return to the table too many times. I'm only one person, but if service is an inconvenience I'll not return.  Shame too, the food has always been great."}
{"text":"We walked out! We arrived with a party of seven, the restaurant was not busy. Over the next 30 minutes many other parties came in and were sat which, to some degree, was to be expected. HOWEVER, when a party of nine came in and were seated immediately we collectively decided to vote with our wallets. I asked the manager and he said there were people still at the table they had chosen for us.   We felt that if their thought process leaned this way, service, should be actually be seated, would be flawed too."}
{"text":"Sooo good the food is amazing the service is great way better than most I had the stuffed fish with gater bites real good them bites and they don't bite back lol everyone loved it they catered to the grandkids well too. the place has a fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place has great vibe. The food was really good I had shrimp p.o. boy which was delicious. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Being a transplant to Charlotte, I was a bit sceptical of a local Cajun restaurant....in the middle of Concord.  Rest assured, it's fantastic.  We've been multiple times at this point, and have even bought visitors with us.  Definitely try the alligator bites.  They are crunchy, and served with a great dip. My personal favorite menu item is the chicken fried chicken, topped with the country gravy.  It's huge, filling, and savory.  The green beans that come on the side have pork fat in them, and are freaking delicious!  I also tried the watermelon iced beverage last time I was there (has vodka in it)...and oh my lord, it was refreshing.   This place is a perfect blend of Cajun and southern.  There is really something for everyone on the menu. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service!! I had been to this restaurant a few times already when I decided to take my friend who was new to the city. I had totally forgotten about his shellfish allergy until we actually got there. The manager Scott and our server Rebecca were awesome. They both went over the menu with him in detail to describe all of the entrees that would work with his allergy and even offered to make substitutions as needed. Scott even made sure that his meal was cooked on a separate grill not used for shellfish. Their service was above and beyond and I really appreciate their dedication to helping him and I both have a great dinner. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and maybe you'll be lucky enough to experience the same service we did."}
{"text":"Hubby & I simply love \"Cajun Creole Food\".  Just reminds us of Orleans!!  The Tricky Fish was Tilapia and Étouffée covered over the fish.  With Cajan green beans, & a lemon wedge... an amazing meal, and to Paige, thank you very much for the suggestions.  We will be back again!!!  We haven't been here in awhile. But the food & Kayla our waitress was amazing.  It being so crowded our food came out hot in a timely manner and in order... Kayla we will be back again, thank you for the great service you gave!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Razoo's. NEVER a bad meal here, always a good time. On my most recent visit, I went solo to the bar to partake in some bayou dining. An curly haired brunette greeted me and asked my name, which she remembered throughout this dinner. I ordered a Peach Mambo and she said it would be right out. She then introduced the other bar tenders and went on taking care of other guest. My drink was out in a matter of minutes and I was ready to order. I had the Fish Aye Yee, a tilapia smothered in a shrimp creole creamy sauce with a side of beans and rice. The Fish Aye Yee is not too spicy. The beans and rice however have a nice spice to them, so beware if you don't like spicy things. There was also a side piece of toast with the perfect amount of garlic butter to tickle your tastebuds. When I was ready to go, I hadn't touched my beans, but noticed they had kind of skimped on them. So I asked the bar tender if I could have some more, which she happily obliged and brought me a takeout container. Overall, a great experience. I highly recommend Razoos for good food and good service. One of my favorites in Charlotte and now that 485 is open, I'll probably visit more often."}
{"text":"Food was awesome stated all 4 family members.  Our waitress was very nice, kept our drinks full, recommended gator which was delicious and she was friendly and we can tell she was very genuine.  Her name is Nichole.  Thanks."}
{"text":"So delicious! I wish I had one near me (hear that Razzoo's, Maryland needs you!). I'm still in awe at how they keep the prices so reasonable with such great quality. In true New  Orleans/Creole fashion the food is expertly seasoned. You can't go wrong with anything you order. From dirty rice to jambalaya and gumbo to shrimp and crawfish to andouille and boudin, everything is authentic. They're not trying to be fancy, just good, down home, filling meals you could find at any grandma's house in the Bayou. If you can't decide or it's your first time get the Cajun combo skillet. It comes with andouille, shrimp creole, crawfish etoufee, red beans n rice, corn, and garlic bread. My favorite is the etoufee. You also can't go wrong with the rat toes or Cajun fondue as a starter. Every trip to Charlotte includes a stop a Razzoo's!"}
{"text":"Always good food...blackened tilapia and poboys are delicious. You have to try the crawfish fondue appetizer!!! Omg it is soooo good!!!! Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Our company frequently goes here for lunch.   Service is excellent,  the food is very good.   Recommend the Trick Fish...."}
{"text":"The best comparison I have is razzos is what cracker barrel is to southern food. Not authentic but a good substitute.they came to be \"sit down\" but they charge you for bread. Waitress did pronounce boudin sausage incorrectly and was over all apathetic with her attitude."}
{"text":"This review is not based on food as we did not stay to eat. It is based solely on the staff, manager, and their attitude when we attempted to eat here. My family of seven walked in to eat here. There were several empty tables in view, and also no one else waiting. We had a larger party, so did expect a wait. They asked us if we could sit in a booth, but 7 is hard to fit into a booth that is comfortable for 4, so we asked for a table seating. We were told that they had an empty table next to a table of people ready to leave and it would be a few minutes. No problem.  We waited, and waited, and waited. Hubby went to the restroom and was able to see the table in question and he said the people weren't ready to leave and in fact were sitting drinking alcoholic beverages and seemed to be in no hurry. In the meantime, several other people came in and were seated immediately. The final blow was when a party of nine came in and were also seated immediately. When asked why a party of nine could be seated the only response we got was, \"Well, we already have a table for you but they haven't left yet.\"  I have worked in restaurants as a hostess before. You don't assume that a table is going to leave and pass up a table that you can seat a waiting party at.    We made a decision to leave and informed the hostess. The manager came out, again, and we also told him. He said it would only be a few more minutes (how does he know when these people may decide to leave?). This is not how you treat customers and we decided to speak with our wallets at that point and go someplace else."}
{"text":"This was our first visit (around 3pm on a Saturday). Everyone was friendly and attentive. I love the decorations from the minute we walked in (clever to decorate with your colorful t-shirts). The food was plentiful and very tasty. I had the shrimp basket with okra instead of the corn (the okra was fantastic). I'd come back again!!"}
{"text":"Good was super! Service was great. Also don't let the packed parking lot and line fool you. You'll get in faster than you think. Felt slightly rushed to leave as the waitress kept asking if we needed a box or something else but I really believe she just wanted to make sure she was doing a good of job as possible. Over all she and the restaurant were fantastic!"}
{"text":"The only problem with razzoos is I live in winston salem, and they're in concord! I absolutely love this place, the food is amazing. Im a huge fan of new orleans cuisine, and this is so far the best I've tried in NC. I wish they would open one in Winston Salem or Greensboro, it would do awesome in this area. Anytime I pass by Concord, I eat here."}
{"text":"Went on a date here last night and had a really good experience.  You totally get the New Orleans' vibe with everything from the decor, menu layout and signature cocktails.  I had the shrimp and grits and they were super yummy. My date had the pork chop and really enjoyed it.  The portions are huge so you'll most likely have a Togo box full of leftover.  No worries they're just as good the next day. Glad I came to my old stomping grounds and indulged in some Cajun Cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome as well as the service!!! Make sure you order the stuffed shrimp with the green beans and the crawfish dip!!!"}
{"text":"EVERYONE, DO NOT EAT HERE!      My friend and I were in this restaurant yesterday and dined at the bar. The bartender's name was Zack. I enjoyed my dinner very much and I had heard great things about the establishment so I was excited to finally be there. However, I was very disappointed in the service I received and the attitude the bartender had. When I ordered another drink, I was served an orange slice that was slimy and glistening in the light. You could see the slime on the orange. When I brought it to Zack's attention, he agreed that the orange was disgusting and he brought me the entire cup of oranges from the refrigerator and told me I could choose from the ones that were there. I threw out 2 others before finding one that seemed safe for human consumption.  I asked Zack if he would cut another one for me and he refused. I offered to pay for the entire orange if he would simply cut another one for me or get me one from the back. He said he didn't even know where the fruit was kept and even if he did know, that it was not in his job description to cut fruit anyway, the morning crew took care of those tasks. He went on to tell me that Razoo's is not a bar, it's a restaurant.     Wow is all I could say to that. I'd hate to be sarcastic and have someone spit in my food or serve me rotten fruit next time, etc...     Now, I attended bartending school and tended bar for many years in my 20's at a restaurant similar to this one. I opened and closed the bar and I have a strong understanding of the responsibilities of the bartender. I now manage a team of 25 people in the sales and service industry, an office environment, and one thing we teach our employees at every place I've ever worked is that you never tell a customer you can't or won't fulfill a request because it's not in your job description. His condescending manner, the fact that he refused to do something so simple and the way that he refused, explaining to me that Razoo's  is not a bar was appalling and insulting.    Unfortunately, I would never dine there again as long as Zack still works there and I will tell all of my friends all over Charlotte and Concord about my experience, suggesting they follow suit."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Cajun food at a pretty reasonable price. You won't be disappointed. Check them out."}
{"text":"I am a fan of their fried chicken which is covered in gravy and served with cajun green beans. A huge plate and BIG meal. The boneless chicken breast is pounded thin and fried perfectly. ...My waitress/bartender was super nice and the service made me feel special. How often do you say that?"}
{"text":"You can tell that this is a fun place when it's busy.  We went in on a Sunday at 4 pm, so it was the opposite of busy.   Service was friendly and helpful, with any explanations of the menu that we needed.   We started with the rat toes and a plate of half fried pickles/ half fried green beans.  Yum!  The pickles were cut thick enough to be able to still have texture and the green beans still tasted fresh, which is hard to achieve in a fried food.    My husband had the bacon wrapped jalapeño shrimp which was good.  I had the stuffed fish, which I thought was delicious, the green beans they serve with them were full of bacony flavored goodness.  One of the daughters has the catfish basket as was very pleased with the portion size, she thought they were light and flakey, too.  Other kid was scared of the menu being too spicy so she decided on a grilled cheese, but wound up being super happy with her choice.    Again, too full for dessert, but I'm sure it's all good."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good fried seafood. We lucked up and found this gem. Even though it was 30 minutes before closing (close at 10pm) they were able to seat my family of four. There seemed to be some confusion about who was selected to be our server. It took 15 minutes and several times of her looking away from our table before our server finally accepted the fact she must take our order. We overlooked her unfriendliness because we wanted to eat.  We ordered a seafood combo platter, shrimp and catfish platter, jambalaya and kid's chicken tenders basket.  Food delivered by a friendly man, possibly a manager.  The narrow strips of Catfish were fried golden. Delicious! The four shrimps were pretty in color and seasoned well but hard and rubbery. The seafood combo platter had a very generous amount of fried crawfish, delicious as well.  My eldest daughter enjoyed her jambalaya however my youngest would not try the chicken strips because they were not crispy but  light in color and looked to not to have been cooked throughly. Our server offered  to \"dropped them in the cooker for a little longer\". Ummm, no thank you. We asked to have it removed.  Later, we noticed the missing hush puppies from our meals.  After notifying our server, the manager (we assumed) cheerfully delivered a basket of hot, sweet and spicy hush puppies. Delicious! No excuses for our unfriendly server (she smiled at the end). But yes, I would give RAZZOO's another try, especially if looking for some Cajun seasoned deep fried seafood."}
{"text":"For starters, if you're going to eat here, I definitely recommend the Cajun fondue dip (shrimp or crawfish).  The dish is very flavorful, cheesy, and my all time favorite!  Also, be sure to save room for dessert because the zydeco dancer is to die for (if you're a cheesecake fan).  Overall -- the food, drinks, service, and atmosphere is always excellent, and the prices are very reasonable.  Needless to say, I've been here multiple times and have never had a problem!  Would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Try the gator, it really does taste like chicken! I've been here a few times and now know it's true. The gator is great! Another favorite is the Cajun combo skillet, it's a bit of everything and it's tasty! This time I tried the Cajun fondue with crawfish and it's very good. The cheese was melted with spices and crawfish, paired on top of the garlic toast. It was delightful. Then I had the Cajun country fried chicken and I wasn't impressed. I personally wish I had stuck to seafood here and won't reorder the chicken. It wasn't bad but just kinda bland to me but at least I'll know for next time!"}
{"text":"Walked in with a warm greeting from the staff which is always a good way to start. Having moved from the NJ/NY area, sanitation grades will make or break a business. I was impressed with the 98% rating, I asked out of curiosity why they didn't get 100% and was satisfied with the answer and the fact they took the time to tell me whether true or false.  Ordered the raw oysters for an appetizer which was fresh and delicious. Had the stuffed shrimps which was just ok with me, think I would have enjoyed it more without the sauce but overall delicious. Seemed weird for the dish not having a veggie it was basically rice with the sauce and stuffed shrimp.  Ordered an Old Fashioned with my friends which it was well prepared but oddly had this weird taste. I'm a whiskey consumer so I know my drinks. The original tasted weird which my friends agreed but the remade was spot on so unsure what they added the first time.  Customer service was great & I would recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"I stopped by Razzoo's Cajun Cafe for lunch and I ordered a Blackened Po-boy sandwich and OMG was it delicious! It comes with fries and hushpuppies which were yummy too!  Sydney was our server and she was on point!   The food came out hot & fresh and the portion was great! I'll be having the second half for dinner!  Oh yes, you have got to taste the raspberry ice tea, it comes in a large mason jar and it's flavored perfectly!"}
{"text":"this was really really good, but the service is awful....we went in there last night with at 8pm...well after a dinner crowd, the place was not busy, we were seated and waited 15 minutes before sending my son to find a server...then after another few minutes I flagged down a manager who promptly got us a server, who was sorry and explained there was a mix up...15 minutes to get drinks, another 15 for apps and dinner came about 9:30...the manager did take our apps off our bill and the food was great, they did put our food order in as a rush, otherwise we may have still been there I am sure, they were very nice but the only reason why I would ever go back is the food was good if you have hours to kill it's worth it..."}
{"text":"Friendly place.  Good service, good food and reasonably priced, clean restrooms.  Casual dining style nick knacks where they over decorate.  Having said that, the fish I ordered was bland.  I didn't eat it, and the chicken fried steak was a bit greasy (so my beau said).      The mashed potatoes were great!   The portions were generous.   The drinks were good too.  Plenty strong, and a good bang for your buck.    Caveat:  Lots of screaming kids, so feel free to bring yours too."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in YEARS! However I was here recently and it's still the same. And the Manager I forget his name he is awesome! He has been here since day one! For is reasonable and also pretty good. If you come you must try the rat toes but warning the are HOT! If you like spicy food this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Well, we checked in but we ended up walking out. Not a good way to start a review.  So we looked this place up on Yelp (of course) and from the reviews and the photos I was super excited to try it! I love creole food and my odd ball kid eats crawfish like they're candy.  We get to the restaurant and it's beautiful. Really nicely decorated and the music was interesting and authentic. We needed a table for seven so they said we would have a bit of a wait which was understandably. Every ten minutes they would say, your table is being cleaned. Took a really long time to clean that table!   While we were waiting and getting more frustrated a party of nine came in behind us..... and was seated immediately. So naturally my entire family is now furious. Do they have a reservation? No, they don't accept reservations so why the heck are they being seated before us!? Their answer? It was more convenient for THEM to seat us where they didn't have to push two tables together.   We left. And on the way out, that table was STILL being cleaned. Hugely disappointing."}
{"text":"As a native Louisianan now living in NC, I am always seeking the authentic atmosphere and flavor I adore in my new home state. Seems most think drenching food in pepper means it's Cajun. Not so. I visited Charlotte for a work trip this week. The good was great, service \"cute\" and friendly. Any local New Orleanian will vouch- atmosphere is the icing on the cake, solidifies an experience. Awesome atmosphere, decore, even zydeco in background. Flavor spot on."}
{"text":"Every time I'm I'm Charlotte I stop here! My favorite dishes are the red beans and rice, the rat toes and the oysters on the half shell. Service is great and the drinks are pretty good."}
{"text":"As a girl from Texas, I am so happy that there is another location of Razzoo's in NC. Whenever I am in the mood for some good cajun/creole/ seafood in the area, Razzoo's is definitely one of the places that come to mind! Laid back atmosphere and plenty of seats, good for hanging out with family and friends.  Each time I come I try something new. I have had the grilled tilapia that comes with rice and beans(with bacon). You can't never go wrong with jalapeno catfish. Everything is always good. Quite honestly, this is the #1 spot to get that real Louisiana crawfish.   They also have awesome drinks here..woohoo. Swamp thang is my favorite! Don't forget Happy Hour 4-7 Monday through Friday!  I absolutely love Razzoo's. Good food, outstanding service, and reasonable prices. It is worth the visit :)"}
{"text":"My two girlfriends and I came to Razzoo's Cajun Cafe for lunch. We ordered the Crawfish Popcorn Bites. It came with fries and a cherry mustard sauce. The fried crawfish was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned. The dipping sauce was really good.  One of my friends got the Cajun Tricky Fish which is blackened fish over dirty rice topped with crawfish etouffee. The fish was baked just right and the etouffee was delicious. I ordered the Pecan crusted catfish. It was slightly crunchy on the outside and the fish was tender and flaky on the inside. Yummy!  My other friend got the salad and gumbo combo off of the lunch menu. It came with Razzoo's famous chop salad and gumbo.  The salad was tasty but the gumbo left a lot to be desired. The roux was too thick and pasty. Je n'ai pas aimé!  Our server, Jenna was very nice and attentive. The environment was colorful, lively, and fun. I would come again!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Razoo's was pretty good. Service was fast and friendly. I enjoyed an appetizer of Fried Gator Tails with the snazzy cocktail sauce along with a basket of fried crawfish with fries and toasted french bread.  Since Outback got rid of the crawfish pasta dish I loved so much, I am so happy to have a place to enjoy crawfish!  The 5-star rating is for their willingness to switch almost any dish to crawfish just for me.  Well, they will do the same for you as well."}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's never disappointed (has came out cold but was redone promptly) If you want a good Cajun meal this is definitely the place to go. It's right in front of Concord Mills so there is sometimes a lot of traffic around the area and this place does get pretty packed but it's worth it. From the fried gator tails and broiled oysters to the Cajun fried chicken and shrimp salad lettuce wraps there is definitely something on the menu for everyone. My go to is Stuffed Shrimp and the gator and oysters as starters. They have really good drinks like the Hurricane and Gator Punch but they are on the sweet side. The service here can be hit or miss tho and the food for larger groups and take a while but all in all you will love the food and will be ready to come back."}
{"text":"First time trying Razoos after wanting to numerous times, worried that it wouldn't be any good.  Now I see what all the fuss has been about. The place was packed, but my husband and I were seated immediately by a friendly hostess.  Everyone was super friendly.The place is Marci gras themed, very loud music. We ordered the rat toes for an app, it was Fat Tuesday so we got it for half price, plus they had loads of drink specials. I got the shrimp po boy and my hubby had the deluxe seafood platter. However the server entered his order wrong so he had an extra wait time on his food. The rat toes was extremely spicy, which we love the portion of 5 is plenty. My po boy was wonderful toasty bread, loads of crunchy shrimp and fresh veggies. I only ate half the portion was huge served with fries and jalapeño puppies(these were the bomb). My husband said his fish was moist and the crawfish tails were crispy and delicious. Unable to order dessert or drinks because we were so stuffed. Next time I think we will split an entree so we can have desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"Oh the po boys! Seriously very good at Razzoo's! I had to get a shrimp since the bf got the blackened chicken last time we were here. It was huge, I couldn't even fit it in my mouth (nobody say that's what she said!). It took me a good 3 minutes to try to cram all the fixins into the french roll. I only finished half..that's after I barely ate the cajun fries and had 2/3 jalapeño cornbread poppers. I wish they took away some of the sides and lowered the price of the sandwich, I'm not a fan of paying that $10 but the po boy sandwich will keep us coming back.   The server was attentive after 10 minutes of neglect, though I'll let it slide, I'm pretty sure she didn't even know we were there. The hostess kind of put us in a random, dark corner. She checked up on us a generous amount after we placed our drink orders. The Gator Punch Jr. was very tasty but huge! It was just too much liquid for the two of us. Beware if you are ordering the regular sized Gator Punch."}
{"text":"I came here with The Hubster and a few friends the day before our conference began. It was great that the hotel shuttle brought us here, since we didn't know the area. The variety of items on the menu was mind-boggling. If you cannot find the dish you want here, it doesn't exist! Our server Trey was extremely helpful and took great care of us. I had the Crawfish Etouffee and it was outstanding. Everyone in our group was extremely pleased with their selections. I wish we had a Razzoo's in Minneapolis, I'd eat there weekly!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on my first date. The food was really good. I got the Cajun fried chicken. The red skin mashed potatoes were divine. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My kids and I absolutely love this place! Been here twice and received amazing service each time"}
{"text":"Being from South Louisiana, Razoo's had a lot to prove to me. However, I was pleasantly surprised! This is very much a \"corporate\" chain and will not ever provide that \"jazz\" you find in true Cajun Cuisine.  I had Stuffed Fish with Rice and Green Beans...it was nice. Was it like a true New Orleans dish? No, but it gives me a nice taste of home.  The atmosphere was fun and greatly decorated! Some must haves are: Hurricanes, crawfish, alligator....Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Try the gator tail;) It was delicious!  Tried this place out while visiting Charlotte. My friend loves Cajun food, and had originally tried Razzoo's in TX, and said we have to give this place a try.   I'm glad we did. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious.   We actually tried so many things off the menu that I'm not sure I can name them all, but I can say that everything we ordered was delicious.  They have a great outside seating area."}
{"text":"Food was tasty with just the right spice and kick. Service was friendly and atmosphere was festive. Never been to LA but assume it would be cool if it's like the decor here. I went with other reviews and got the sampler skillet. Cool that it actually was served in a Lodge skillet. See pic."}
{"text":"This is a chain we frequented in Texas and this location is everything we remember. The rat toes are great but they are stuffed jalapeños and are very spicy. The crawfish etouffe and jambalaya pasta were amazing and both very full of flavor. We used to get the Gator Punch Jr. and that was enough alcohol to get both of us drunk. There is a large Gator Punch that is intended for four people."}
{"text":"Love coming to razzoos , food is great , service prompt and food delicious . Usually when I come I never have to wait too long to be sat . The decor is very warming and definitely gives you that  Louisiana vibe. I recommend the stuffed fish , the platter sampler and the bread pudding .  The salads are so fresh  , I have them add cheese to mine as an added mmmmmm .  We had Paul W. tonight and he was so nice and Just an all around great server ."}
{"text":"I'm not from Louisiana.  That being said, I love this place.  The food is always great!  The fried pickles are AMAZING.  The fried green beans are a close second.  Fried cat fish is the best I have EVER had.  All fish dishes I have ordered have been cooked and seasoned perfectly.  For dessert, if you have room, the peach bread pudding with rum sauce makes my taste buds scream with joy!  :D Caution:  If you are on a diet, avoid this place.  There are a couple of grilled dishes but most dishes are either fried, buttered and/or smothered in deliciousness.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious and atmosphere is great. No complaints with service. Always been good so far. The crab dip is to die for."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the rat toes! Those are the greatest appetizer I've ever order anywhere! They are like a jalapeño popper stuffed with Cajun spices and crab! Wow. Those alone were worth returning for. The atmosphere is fun and friendly.  Their sauces are great- especially the cherry mustard! Wow! The fried pickles were right on, and we like the gator tail as well.  The server was very friendly and gave us great recommendations. The shrimp and grits were not spicy like I wanted, but still very good."}
{"text":"Love their catfish baskets but customer service is hit or miss! Some evening you may luck out and get a great server but on other days you may just bomb out. Usually a decent spot to get a quick meal."}
{"text":"Killing time at Concord Mill Mall at dinner time and wanted something different. This was really good!  Kids choices were just ok, but at $4.99 includes a drink which is nice. I wish they had a grilled shrimp or fish option -but both my kids ordered corn dogs and loved them. My husband and I ordered the Sampler Skillet. A good deal at $12.99, includes shrimp and rice, beans and rice AND crawfish and rice. Plus a sausage, toasted garlic bread and corn on the cob. A lot of rice, but each one different and each one good. Reasonable size portions for a dinner."}
{"text":"The food was a little salty but that's probably evay I get for getting fried things. The gator was good (bough I've had better outside Louisiana). I was not a fan of the fried pickles and the Jaws Seafood platter we got to share was loaded with them. We didn't get any crawfish or jalapeño pups on ours which is odd. We ordered it for 2 but it could've easily fed 4-5 people. The Hurricanes were awesome and strong, I'll definitely be back to partake in those. The rat toes and fondue were good as well. I'll come back to try different foods, just nothing else fried for this girl."}
{"text":"I've always seen this place passing by the road going to/from Concord Mills but never tried it out until having time to experience lunch here the other day.  Interesting concept, but at least they go \"all in\" the place is very interesting to look at on the outside, at it continues inside.  First of all it is pretty big.  We sat in the area to the right and when I went to use the restroom, it was all the way across the place in a different dining room section - so this place is easily set up to handle a big crowd.  Lucky for us the lunch crowd wasn't too hoppin' that day.  Our server was pretty nice and we started with the fried gator appetizer (not on the menu)... pretty darn good and comes with a tangy cocktail sauce.  I had the lunch portion of the hurricane shrimp that showed up in a hot cast iron skillet.  Props to Razzo for presentation, but I don't think any part of the dish was ever cooked in a skillet... I digress but it was still good non-the-less.  My friend had the chicken etouffe which was a huge serving (for lunch portions).  He cleaned up his plate so that's a pretty good sign.  Though there wasn't a big lunch crowd, service was a little slow, but good thing we weren't in a hurry to do anything - it just gave us more time to look at the murals on the wall or the colorful glass bottles that adorn the booth dividers.  Overall a solid dining experience, I dunno if the genre of food (cajun) is my cup-of tea, but I will definitely keep this place in mind if I am feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"We love to try something different and this was it without a chain feeling. Service was great with local beers on tap, Rat fingers were awesome and just spicy enough. Gator tail was delicious! Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and fun atmosphere. Staff was polite but seemed annoyed at a large group for a birthday. Maybe work isn't where you want to be on a Saturday night, but that is your job. So maybe take a little pride in it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, once when it first opened and once about a week ago. I was nervous coming back the second time because the first wasn't that great. This place did not disappoint! The food was great and so was the service. The drinks could stand to be a little stronger and the hostesses could stand to be a little nicer. We went in on a busy Saturday night (12/5/16) and our party wasn't treated the best when asking for a wait time. They apparently do not give out wait times. You just wait."}
{"text":"This was a really good find. We had the boudin stuffed chicken and the jalapeño catfish strips.  The mashed potatoes were super good with the chicken. And the rice with the catfish simply yummy!  Definitely recommend this if you are looking for something around here. Oh and well priced"}
{"text":"We had Kayla as our server and she was outstanding! I didn't bring my reading glasses and couldn't see the menu in the lighting very well but she helped me and read me the menu and gave suggestions! Our drinks were never empty and she was very attentive and fun! It was my sons birthday and she made it really fun for the whole family. Hope she is my server again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Okay let me tell you that food was EV-ver-ree-thang! I will admit I'm allergic to shell fish, so no shrimp or crab for me. And I didn't want to try the crawfish just to be in the safe side. But my friends all enjoyed their meal! Let's talk about those wings! Who's grandma was back there burning and putting their foot into that batter and seasonings?! WHO?! I enjoyed my Cajun chicken and those green beans. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Last minute idea and the food and service was outstanding! Ribs melted in your mouth chicken light and flaky and ice cold beer"}
{"text":"We had the jalapeño catfish and tricky fish. Both were excellent... Spicy and tasty and filling. And of course, Fat Tire goes with anything. The service was top shelf and not a long wait. We're happy."}
