{"text":"Our favorite little bar down the street. Cold beer for cheap prices. Good food and a good sized menu, I like the western burger. Karaoke is here on Tuesday nights with Dave! Live bands on wednesday through Saturday. We love Johnny the bartender, but every bartender has been awesome."}
{"text":"Went for a steak, and decided on the All You Can Eat Fish Fry.......
It was very busy, so service was slow. It was also Line-Dancing night so I wasn't thrilled by the music. 
The fish was a joke, seemed like something that 7min prior was frozen, and the fries were very very basic. I ordered round 2 of the fish and was told that another order of fries was extra. This place needs to take a Fish Fry serious, or simply take it off the menu. Local place I may try again for a Steak, but not really sure about the C&W Music playing. Its a turn off for me."}
{"text":"Food is ok nothing really special. Went on a weekend night and it smelled really weird in there. They had line dancing which was cool but I think the average age in there was 50. 

We only stayed about an hour but we got 2 drink and they were both pretty gross. Way to strong and not good alcohol. Most likely will not revisit."}
{"text":"I have tried this place 4 times now (I should have learned on my first try, but I do give benefit of the doubt).  This place is designed ONLY for regulars.  If you are not a regular, I have discovered that you wait an unreasonably LONG time to get any sort of service.  It's sad, as the atmosphere seems to be nice and they do have things going on nearly every night, BUT it seems like it is designed only for regulars.  I would think at least after 4 times there, that I might have at least some sort of decent service....NO............so sorry, so sad, you have lost a great customer that could bring \"real money\" and people into your establishment."}
{"text":"SCREW THIS PLACE!!! If you want a bar with crappy bartenders and a boring crowd then this place is for you! Make sure you're not too loud though, you might make the crappy live band upset. Oh, and I'm warning you now of the funky smell that this place has and trust me it's not a good smell, when I say funky I mean horendous! To sum up, if you are lame, over 40, and like the smell of funk this is definitely the bar for you."}
{"text":"Might be good for the over 40 crowd but was a little lame for me. Tried the sriracha wings & they were pretty tasty but other then that this place just isn't worth another visit"}
{"text":"I ended up eating here because Spinato's was closed, I ordered a Cobb salad which said it had \"mixed greens\" in it which was just a plate of lettuce and maybe some romaine, but who knows, it's so dark in there, I could hardly see what I was eating. There was some tiny processed turkey strips, hardly any avocado, very little cheese, AWFUL salad and way overpriced for what it was. Service was OK, took forever to get our bill with few very customers. Would NOT recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Awesome food & great friendly staff. Awesome new owners,  this is definitely NOT the old Aros Grill.  A definite must try..."}
{"text":"Awful... don't waste your time or money. We were there at 6:00 p,m. and the service getting drinks from the bar to our table was slow and the drinks were lame. The food was bland and basically tasteless. The quesadilla, which was listed under \"Mex\" on the menu consisted of nothing more than cheese and chicken (which cost $3.00 extra) and was barely warm. No onion, no green pepper, no spices, not even salt or pepper. My husband ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, which was also bland and didn't have the faintest hint of \"spice.\" I would not recommend this place to anyone and would give it negative stars if that were possible, but this site makes me give it at least one star."}
{"text":"First of all, I came here on a Friday night. A lady with a very loud, high annoying voice was trying to teach a group of old people how to square dance. Then, our food took 45 minutes to arrive and wasn't even good. I ordered the California burger and it was falling apart in my hands. The bathroom smelled terrible, like a mix between cat urine and rotting corpse. Oh yeah, and there are multiple decapitated animal heads all over the walls. Over all this place sucks, sorry to say, but its true. I wish I could have gone here with Ed Bassmaster, and we could have walked out of the restaurant, look back, and say \" pshhhh\" at the same time."}
{"text":"Raw chicken sandwich!  Got lucky and didn't get violently ill!  Picture of sandwich is posted in the photo section of Yelp's establishment info."}
{"text":"Lousy. Went with my GF a few months back to check it out since we live close by. No one even noticed we were there until we were leaving. Cliquish, cold, and never going back. If I could give a minus rating, i would. 
Better off going to Spinato's or Codfather's or even Xhale."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided on a date night to do a little dancing. She heard of a country bar recently opening close to us so we decided to check it out. Arriving about 8 pm the place was full but not overly crowded. The band was just about to go on. Nice dance floor and the patrons didn't run into you while dancing. We had a good time and will be back again. 

I didn't catch the name of the band that was playing but they were good. We left just about midnight and they only took one short break. Hard working band for sure. A mix of older country, new stuff and even some classic rock. 

We grabbed some food when we got there. Not bad for bar food. Potato skins were good. I had the patty melt and my wife had the Philly cheese. Don't expect anything but bar food quality. We didn't and were not disappointed. They had Kiltlifter on tap also. Always a plus for me."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is a SPORTS BAR.  This is not cuisine at it's finest, it's bar food.  And hot bar food at that!!  Had the potato skins and the green chili burger, the skins were hot and fresh, and the burger had real green chilis under the monterey jack cheese.  Beer is cold and tastes fresh, I'm rating this high on the sports bar scale.  Monday Night Football was playing on the big screen, and there were flat panels on every corner.  There is a small stage set up for a band, I presume on Friday-Sunday nights.  It looked like we were sitting in the middle of the dance floor, because we were.  This is redneck at it's finest!!  I'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to leave a bad review here, it may be a great place for the crowd it attracts. My girlfriend and I went here to scope out the place since this is the only bar walking distance from both of our places. As girls in our mid twenties, I can say this place is a no go. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the smell. It was strange; the closest thing that comes to mind is \"nursing home.\" We ordered a drink, listened to the live music for a minute or so and left. The obviously older crowd, however, seemed to be having a great time."}
{"text":"Dwight & Sandi Nelson are great dance instructors--would be more than worth going Fri. and Sat. nights just for that!  We had 1/2 lb. burgers--freshly made patties and good fries.  

We're country western dancers and our first priority for a place is can we enjoy dancing there?   Band was decent.  The dance floor is linoleum, but fine for dancing.   Atmosphere was \"sports bar.\"  Being \"over 50\" ourselves, we liked the crowd.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Reasons I love this bar:
1. They serve Pinot Grigio (this is very important to me)
2. They have purse hooks
3. They have something going on every night wether it be karaoke, live bands, or dance lessons
4. They have a pool table
5.  Good food
6.  Everyone is nice
7.  They put beer in mason jars
8. They have twelve different beers on tap"}
{"text":"We came here twice in one evening for drinks - before and after dinner the we had across the parking lot.  We didn't try any food here.  They had no drink specials that night.  The beer was cold but the selection was minimal. Liquor selection is pretty minimal as well.  The bartender Johnny was attentive enough.  I think the downfall is the music. Before dinner it was juke box. That can be cool but it seemed annoying that night. Perhaps the crowd. After dinner there was karaoke. OMG it was terrible. We were just ready to leave and probably not come back. Maybe it's just not our type of crowd."}
{"text":"We are not big fans of sports bars, so I am not rating the environment, only the food and the service.
We came here due to a coupon we had... that is how we try new places.
We both had the meat loaf Thursday special, I wish we would have ordered one meat loaf and one sandwich, we were considering the spicy chicken sandwich.

Dinner was OK, I am not a big fan of meat loaf either, not sure why I decided on it, but it has bacon on top and that made for it. It was smothered on gravy, which I do not like much either, came with mashed potatoes and green beans (lately I eat my green beans lightly sauteed, so these felt way over cooked, but they were still good, with bacon and onion... so far all this is 3 stars or so.

However, we noticed the menu said they make their home made chili beans with chorizo, and since my hubby is a big fan of chorizo, we decided to order a cup just to give it a try. I believe it was $3.5 for a cup, and $5.99 for a bowl.

Well, the chili arrives and it is bigger than we expected, that was between 1.5 or 2 cups... it had cheese on top and raw onions. It looked good, and very reasonable portion... actually we were both thinking maybe we mistakenly got a bowl instead of a cup. Hubby had like half and he loved it. He said 5 stars out of 5. He saved the leftovers for a breakfast burrito : )

Lastly, our server Jill was very friendly and attentive.

This place is not close to home but we would probably stop here again if we are in the neighborhood... or craving chili beans. : )

**I noticed they are open for Breakfast on weekends, we may give that  a try too..."}
{"text":"Husband and I went in for breakfast. I ordered 2 eggs sausage and hash browns, husband ordered steak and eggs. It was slow and everyone about 6 others were at the bar. 

Half hour later I told the guy it was taking too long for breakfast. He blamed it on the steak (even though husband asked for medium not well done). Waiter/ bartender still blamed the steak.... Tells us it was frozen. Gross. We left and Will Never go back. Bye."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to dance and listen to great country music and this was and is the place!!!   Dance floot is large and bar is ample. Food is good bar food. They even have lessons 3 days a week. We are definately going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"If u could give a negative star i would.   We weren't acknowledged for 15 mins,  then they acted put out that we wanted to order,  then it took 30 mins for some appetizers then...  They charged 75 cents for ranch.   Wtf...  No refills,  no checking on us,  atmosphere is weird it's like if you're not a regular you are not a customer.  Will never be back"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar."}
{"text":"I'm a regular bar goer and have gone here a few times, had fun on each visit, the 'regulars' seem to be friendly and inviting, bar staff is patient and attentive. I've tried a couple of the daily specials which change everyday, had the ribs on Wednesday (I am pretty picky about my ribs) and they really do them well, large portion with good sides.
 Drinks...what can you say about drinks...beer is cold, mixed drinks are well poured, bartenders don't have weak elbows here. Service has always been fast, empty beer bottles make me sad and they made sure that mine wasn't empty, usually with one on deck.
 I'm usually not a fan of live bands or country music as far as that goes but they seem to book some pretty good acts, not to loud, plenty of people dancing, I don't dance but they did tell me they have dance lessons a few nights a week so who knows.
 Overall I found this place to be friendly, fun and not the normal 'sausage fest' type bar I find mostly in North Phoenix which is a good thing for us single guys."}
{"text":"From the outside it looked like a good place to cowboy food. Turned out to the the worst bar food ever. My boyfriend ate the Chicken Parmesan and it made him very stomach sick.
My patty melt tasted like a sponge soaked in clarified butter. The burger had no flavor and the grilled onions were mush. Add to the experience, a waitress who did not care."}
{"text":"I was there late night so I only have that to go on. It was terribly slow and there was karaoke. I can usually tolerate karaoke but it was just awful and way too loud. I'm also positive that the bartender was drinking behind the bar. Maybe, I'll give it a try during dinner time but I doubt it."}
{"text":"The building and location are good. Nice outdoor patio and lots of TVs but...the food was awful. I tried the buttermilk chicken fingers from the apps menu and my husband tried the fish tacos. Yuck! The fish tacos were pieces of fish stick chopped up. The chicken fingers were some type of battered, pressed chicken patties served with a side of watery ranch dressing. I encountered 3 chunks of gristle in the one pattie I ate. The atmosphere was bad as well. We wanted to sit on the patio and look at the Monday night football game but one of the TVs was broken. Just as well since there was some obnoxious guy on the patio talking loudly (quite possibly drunk) in front of the other TV.

Really nicely set up place that would probably be good for a place to tip a few cold ones but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"Prices are really cheap, but bad interior. Beers is warm and live band is not good. A lot older crowd than expecting for Saturday night. Average age is 50+  

Didn't eat because entire appetizer menu is deep fried, but the prices were good, just wish beer was cold."}
{"text":"This place is a real hit or miss on how big the crowd is 
But the bands are always getting rowdy and staying true to the older country which is always nice to see 
pretty decent sized dance floor the band is right next to the dance floor which I like and the food here isn't bad at all. But. 
Don't go for the food. 
Go for the kickass tunes

Also they serve beer in mason jars which is always cool"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go but definitely wouldn't be my first choice of a bar I'd ideally go to. It's convenient to go to watch football however because there are flatscreens everywhere and it is also really close to my apartment. I've been here three times and service isn't bad but it wasn't great. I definitely had to wait about 20 mins to get serve. They aren't very attentive and don't really seem to care much about their guests. We usually sit by the pool table where the bartender can clearly see us yet every time we're there they still seem to ignore us knowing we've been sitting there waiting for a while. Okay I'm a server/bartender I know that even if its not you're section you should still acknowledge your guest. .

Overall Food was good, service was decent and the atmosphere was okay."}
