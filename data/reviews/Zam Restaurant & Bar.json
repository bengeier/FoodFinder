{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try something new and stumbled upon Zam.  The restaurant looked brand new but it has been around for 20 years!  The food was definitely amazing!!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good Serbian food, friendly staff and good price, nice atmosphere. If you are reserving table I suggest ask for table by the fireplace. Cheers"}
{"text":"Good, tasty Serbian food. Turns into a bar/lounge quite early but it was not obnoxious when I was there and the waiter was accommodating. A fine place for takeout, which I'm glad to see offered! For dining in I'd recommend going earlier in the evening. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Is this place even open? Came by hoping to have dinner on a Friday night around 6pm. No cars in sight, doors locked, and looked like the place had been abandoned."}
{"text":"Zam is a true South Etobicoke gem. Serbian resto-lounge located next to a Nissan auto dealership. Hidden away in industrial hell. Blink twice and you might miss it.  Two words: SWORD PLATTER. A variety of different, exquisitely prepared, grilled meats, Serbian style, skewered on an actual sword. Serves 2 people. Authentic European cuisine at its best.  Becomes a nightclub environment on Fridays and Saturdays nights.   Worth the drive to Acton."}
{"text":"Everything here is SO freakin good. I came here for a birthday and we had everything from salads to a sword platter full of different meats. I had had Serbian food before but this was my first time at a restaurant. I love cevapis but everything else came very close especially the pita bread."}
{"text":"We had an incredible dinner. Food quality and price match. Furthermore food is just so good and tasty you need to try it. Customer service is top level if Miss Hena is there. We arrived late just 30 min before they closed. She treated us so nicely and gave us the time to eat with no rush. She is very good to advise choices of food and wine too so trust her if you are not sure what to order."}
{"text":"Was looking for something to eat before seeing a movie, and having trouble finding gluten free options. Zam was able to easily accommodate and helpfully suggested a meat platter -- fantastic! (They weren't that familiar with the allergy but made an effort to understand and ensure we'd be safe). A nice variety of meats, a delicious cheese mixture & 'cole slaw' type appetizer, and nice crispy fries. Unfortunately this neighbourhood is pretty out of the way for us, but if we were in the area we'd hit up Zam again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"3-3.5, I wanted to bump it up for the kind and friendly service, but I think that that would be a bit misleading.  Location:  On Queensway, just East of Ikea and West of the VW dealership.  Building looks like a 2-storey house.  Atmosphere:  Dim, more loungey/bar atmosphere.  There was only another table dining while I was there, so it was very quiet.  Music alternated from some Serbian (??) music - Mariah Carey - other - silence.  I can imagine it being a nice setting in a downtown busy area, for after work drinks.  Service:  Nice, kind, friendly, laid-back.  Refilled water - fresh cup - without asking.  Drink:  Since we didn't order an app, we asked for the drink menu which consisted of only beers, wines (both white & red), & coffees.  We ordered a red from Montenegro (Cheval something?) and it was very smooth, not too acidic or dry for my liking!  Food:  This was where the minus stars came into effect.  We ordered Sword Platter for 2 which was basically a bunch of different meats that was presented on an actual sword, but removed shortly thereafter.  It came with a side of sliced potatoes that were fried and a \"Serbian chilli\".  The 2 things that stood out were the cevapi and potatoes.  The rest weren't that memorable for me.  The pork neck (looked like a chop/steak) that I had was gristly/a bit too fatty for me, the chicken breast was a bit bland (tasted as though it was from frozen), the \"Black Jack\" (stuffed pork tenderloin) was awh-ight, and the large meatball thing that was stuffed with bacon again had a fridge-y smell to it.  The \"Serbian chilli\" was waaay too salty.  When the server asked me what I thought, I sorta told him!  (I just couldn't contain myself 'cause it was inedibly salty.)  I would've liked to eat more of it, but just couldn't eat more than a coupla spoonfuls.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but I noticed that the meat did not retain its heat soon after it was removed from the sword.  After my second piece or so, most of the items were already room temp/cooled off.  Overall, I think previous reviews pumped this place up for me too much.  The service was very pleasant, but the food didn't stand out for me enough to go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Wow.  The food here is SO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD and inexpensive.  It was my first time having Serbian food (non home-cooked) and I have to say, wow.  We ordered the meat sword, and all the meats were grilled to perfection - the cevapis were a highlight.  And, being someone who has never really liked beans, their Serbian baked beans were just out of this world!  So steeped in flavour!  Lastly, I forget the name of the deep fried goodness with cream cheese inside - but I ate that up despite being lactose intolerant, and wow was it amazing (I suffered afterwards, but what the heck - well worth it!).  Staff are super nice and the wines were also fantastic (Serbian too!).    Also: love the charm of the Serbian R&B videos playing in the background.  ;D  Note: this place is easy to miss if you're driving - located RIGHT after the VW dealership and before the highway entrance if you are heading west.  Unfortunately not a ton of parking, as far as I could see."}
