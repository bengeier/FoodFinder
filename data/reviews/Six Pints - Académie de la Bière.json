{"text":"I was looking for a relaxed place to have a burger and a beer and this place allowed for that. However, it was really overpriced for what it was. I got the blue cheese & bacon burger ($18) which is not what I hoped it would be (meaning, cooked with the blue cheese inside) and the burger was tough. I was offered a side of poutine instead of fries, but didn't know it would be a $4 upcharge. I also ordered a beer which was good, but $13. In total with tip I paid about $45 just for myself. It is the airport, I know, but I was hoping for better quality. Service was good. But I don't think I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Here is a little oasis in the bowels of the grossest airport. But I won't go on about how disgusting the Montreal airport is, if you are reading this and you have made the journey to Gate 21, I don't need to tell you. Good menu, yummy fish and chips and really great grilled veggie salad with goat cheese. The staff there were all smiling and laughing which made the atmosphere really welcoming. I must call out Mike who was my server at the bar. He was so professional he made me feel I was at a 5-star resort. Thank you Mike. All in all a very nice experience."}
{"text":"My parents were coming back from a visit to California, so went to pick them at the airport, got there an hour in advance, so decided to grab a drink at their bar.  The had many varieties of beer but only 3 types of cocktail :long island ice tea, bloody Caesar and maguerita. Obviously being at the airport, the prices were high. But then the bartender told me than they ran out of tequila (the cheeper brand) and had to use Patron Gold tequila which would cost and extra 4$. So in total i paid for a 21$ ling island ice tea. Way to expensive and it wasn't that great. By the way I noticed that their marguerita mix were those already pre made ones in bottles. Not worth it at all"}
{"text":"honestly not bad for airport food. Is it overpriced as hell? Yes. But, both the beer and food were really tasty. They have a nice selection of beer as well, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a poutine which was delicious and the service was fast and professional. would definitely recommend if you want to grab a nice tall glass of beer before you fly."}
{"text":"Nachos. Canada loves them but manages to confuse what they are. You'll hear locals talk about going to the store to grab a bag of \"nachos\" (tortilla chips). This lounge/pub listed nachos with shredded beef and that was it?  When I asked I was told it had cheese, salsa, jalape√±os, and olives. Kinda an odd service of \"nachos\" but the shredded pot roast style beef was quite tasty."}
