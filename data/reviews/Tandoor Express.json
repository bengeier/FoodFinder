{"text":"Worst service I had in years unreasonable price Food taste ok, but let's just say for the Butter Chicken I ordered, the ratio of Chicken the sauce is about 3:7..."}
{"text":"I've came here once for lunch and once for dinner, and everyone loved it both times. This is fast becoming my go-to place when I'm in the mood for middle eastern food. Almost everything was super tasty and cooked to perfection. The curries and BBQ were incredibly flavorful, and the meats were juicy and tender. Service was fantastic. I can only thing of three downsides.   We got served a complimentary starter of three chutneys (mango, corriander, and chilli) and they were a bit of a let down. I think they would have been better off skipping this altogether. The meat tasted a bit like they had been frozen for a bit too long, but it was barely noticeable."}
{"text":"I have been to Tandoor Express a number of times this year and So far... not been disappointed. Should add, I am a vegetarian so typically order their fabulous veg assorted kababs, a paneer dish, dall and roomali rotis/ naan. Found their biryani/ veg pulao to be pretty good too, as well as the raita, which is standard. A friend of mine goes crazy on their chutneys, specially the mint one, which usually arrives with the papad soon as you sit down to dine in. These guys take their food seriously. Surprised to see couple of bad reviews for this place. I am originally from Delhi, and having tried a bunch of other places that serve rubbery tofuesque paneer, I feel thrilled to eat here.  They warn you the kababs (veg!) will take 25 mins but trust me, worth the time... they make it from scratch after you order and the taste is delectable. It's a small, nicely done up joint, and their service is quite good as well, with the manager at least once coming to check if everything is per our expectations.  If you want to try this place out for dining in (haven't ordered take out though they seem very busy with take out orders), I'd suggest ordering the kebabs over phone, while on your way over... Overall, after trying a number of other joints, their paneer n kababs are pretty much the best, even if the dal is a bit heavy... Rotis, Nans and roomalis all awesome.... I'm taking my parents here soon, they're visiting from Delhi and quite picky with Indian food, so you can tell I'm a believer!"}
{"text":"Was really hungry for some naan and kebab. Went here, lady told me they didn't serve kebab and she wasn't sure if their food was halal or not.  My wife ate food here a while back and they ate beef kebab.  I just took a couple of naans to eat with some nihari I had at home.  The naan the lady gave me was the crustiest, stalest naan I have ever ate in my life. She didn't even warm them for me. I literally felt like throwing the naan out."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch with a friend. The service was great! the server welcoming us, got us seat and took out order nicely. The seating area is nicely decorated and the place is very clean.  we both ordered chicken kabab with rice and trust me we weren't disappointed. The food came in a decent time and was hot and happening. The presentation of the food was very well done and the chicken was tender, hot and perfectly spiced. The rice was good size.  For my Muslim folks - The meat served here is Halal!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!  I made an order for pick up. Butter Chicken and Lamb Biryani (Mutton). I picked it up and came home. Found out the owner didnt give us Butter chicken, gave us some other dish. I think it was curry. The butter chicken was for my wife as she doesnt like lamb. The dish he gave her instead was not what she wanted. I called and mentioned this to him. The stingy owner did not want to do anything to fix the issue. He actually suggested we come back and give him the dish and grab the one we want. This was a good 20 mins after we picked up the order and came home.   The owner is very stingy! beware, he will not replace a mistake or fix it in any way that will satisfy you.   Before this happened I was in there once picking up a to go order and there were a cute young indian couple that obviously had an issue with their order. They wanted 5 dollars back. He would not give them 5 dollars cash!!!! He was making up all these excuses about balancing the till at the end of the day. He kept offering them cheap alternatives like naan and soup and other things they did not want. I waited there for my order and watched this happen like it was a an episode of kitchen nightmares. From this experience I should have known that when my turn came where an issue occurred I would get the lowest level of customer service from the owner.  The food is good, but the customer service sucks. Avoid this owner, check the other review, 10% off the bill for a mistake that big is not a proper resolution."}
{"text":"Tandoori Express  is the latest eatery in the Dhaba sweepstakes that sometimes overwhelms Mississauga/ Brampton. I had done take out 2 twice from here both times my chosen curry was swimming in oil and leaking. This time as I was passing by I though I would trying dining in to see if I would get better results. Decor wise the place is small but  done up very nice and step up from most places which tend to open up in previous restaurants thus having low start up costs and tend to have a minimal atmosphere.  I started with the Hara Bhara Kebab, which didn't have much minced meat in it. The kebabs had a bad oily after taste to it. I ate 1 and left the rest. Next up was the lamb Kadai which I ordered with the naan and a roomali roti. Interestingly the take out menu includes a naan while dining in it is extra. The lamb quality was good as many places use a lower quality meat or over cook it and thus it tends to have \"rubbery\" texture. The dish was again overly oily for my tastes but I guess that is pretty much the standard sadly in many but not all Indian/ Pakistani places.  Interestingly as I'm paying the manager/owner asked why I left kabab starter uneaten and I told him. He went to the kitchen for a few minutes and his only response was to give me a \"10%\" discount on the meal !    Overall: This place is new so it has potential but as I eat Indian food often in Mississauga there are better places for about the same prices."}
{"text":"Yeah! I dig into Indian food. So here's the low down...their chicken tandoori is great...usually, but do yourself a favor and ask for well done. Try their lamb biryani (Indian paella with a kick) to go with that. That's really their specialty. Other stuff like butter chicken ...they are OK but not great. They are great at grilling (period). Rest, not the best but why would you go to a grill to order non-grill? Right? My two cents."}
{"text":"If you are looking for that rare, authentic, flavorful taste of North Indian cuisine, it has arrived!  Tandoor Express is Indian Mughlai cooking at it's best  The staff under the watchful eye of the Manager, leaves nothing to chance.  They are responsive, friendly and very warm and sincere.  We celebrated our mum's birthday there last night and thanks to them, it was a memorable experience.  The Manager Mr. D'Souza exceeded our expectations and his attention to service excellence and customer centricity, left us wanting more.  Keep up the good work, well done!  Mark P. in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Didn't impress me. Food tastes like a lot additives are added. Is very expensive too. The place seems nice and clean. I still eat there but only if I have no other options."}
