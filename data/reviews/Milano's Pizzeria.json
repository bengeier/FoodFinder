{"text":"Good wood fire pizza  ,good toppings for the pizza, good thin crispy crust, good chicken wings. Service is good, nice server that was happy to help; Family friendly and very casual ambiance. We went on Wednesday, late, hour before closing. I will come here again to try the other pizza options"}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I went here on Saturday night.  There was zero wait time, which was nice.  When you first walk in, there's a bar and big TVs.  The newly expanded restaurant to the left is spacious and warm.  Even the menu is HUGE, full of Greek and Italian options.  The pickiest of people will find something here, guaranteed, and the atmosphere works for everyone from singles to families with kids.   We split the white pizza with chicken and broccoli (yummy) and then split the warm cookie dessert (way yummy).  The staff was fast and friendly and I'm ready to go back :)  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We've been fans of Bellagio for more than a year now. Menu favorites include the roasted red pepper hummus (don't let the jalapenos scare you off -- it's really not very spicy), the Greek salad (crispy, fresh Romaine; amazing dressing), the classic gyro, the chicken shawarma pita (big pieces of perfectly cooked white-meat chicken) and the thin-crust pizza. We have several vegetarians in the family and they always find plenty to choose from.   As other reviewers mentioned, there's seldom a wait and it's clean, well-priced and the service is good.   One caveat -- the infamous belly dancers? Not so much. So we avoid going Saturday nights after 7:30 -- like the plague."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for many years and Bellagio Pizzeria is one of my favorite places in this part of the city. Delicious food, portions are good for price, and service is always unbelievably awesome. The wood fired pizza is so delicious and the pizza boxes are so beautiful! Makes me reminisce about living in Italy for a few years with beautiful landscapes, mouthwatering cuisine, and handsome Italian men who don't speak English."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant on and off for years but after what happened yesterday never again.  It was 4PM and I was sitting at the bar having a beer with a client of mine. We were having a quiet non confrontational discussion about the election. We are both Trump fans. They had a shift change and the nice male bartender was leaving and a tattooed not so nice female bartender replaced him. We closed out with him and finished our beers. They were empty for probably 10 minutes and she walked past us at least five or six times. So I said when you get a chance can we have another beer and this was her response:  I WOULD BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER BEER AS LONG AS YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT POLITICS!!!!!!   She is a liberal and didn't agree with our conversation.  I laughed as I thought she was kidding but she wasn't. We immediately left.  I Will NEVER EVER return to this place and I urge anyone that reads this to do the same!!!!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service, Pizza was Amazing! Chicken wings are okay, but I don't think I would buy them again.  To dry for my likings"}
{"text":"Was 4 of us all had something different and all very happy.  I like the fact the Italian dishes came with a nice salad ( most places now that's an up charge) fresh baked bread sticks were nicely seasoned with butter and parmigiano.  Our waitress Chase very good, just the right amount of attention and friendly.   Great food, service, and price hard to beat this one."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and a very friendly staff also had some other dishes on the menu and very good as well  Cool ass beer also"}
{"text":"Stopped in today Thursday 1/9/2014 for lunch at 12:30 with a work partner as we were told by our client that this place had good food. Upon walking in the front door it was an odd experience and an absolute first time that I witnessed such lousy service! The young man had a terrible attitude which he made sure all knew. Not once did he even make eye contact with me he just looked down at my shoes as I asked if we could sit in the bar. The bar was empty, no bar tender, no people but there are high tops with plates and silverware. He says it will be fifteen minutes. I ask fifteen minutes for what? He said until we can help you. So I ask again can we sit in the bar to which he says yes. Now we sit followed by another couple who also sat in the bar. No body greeted us for the duration of 15 minutes nor were we acknowledged by any staff members whatsoever. During this time a man came in and sat at the bar. The young man that \"helped\" us had to get something from behind the bar directly in front of this now 3rd seating with zero contact and said absolutely nothing to him. The man looked around as if the hidden cameras would appear any time but he then left. This place is not worth your time nor your hard earned money when they treat customers or potential customers with such disrespect! Either they are incompetent or they do not have the amount of properly trained staff to handle being in the restaurant business. I think there were 3 people on staff during lunch in an area with limited choice and if that is the excuse the management gives it is not relevant. Bad attitudes, zero wait staff contact and 15 plus minutes wasted waiting for what seemed like people who did not want us there to then have to go find another place to eat on our limited lunch period, what a joke! I made sure to tell the client of our experience after wasting what was about 30 minutes to get zero service. I will gladly remind anyone I know of this experience as today Bellagio cost me time and money. The hotel should sue this place for defamation of a great name as service is half of the experience and in some cases it is more! If you enjoy lousy service and rude wait staff this place is for you! Why must I leave even 1 star? Yelp please fix to where we can leave zero stars for the very deserving!"}

{"text":"Did not get excited to go after a second piece of pizza. Needs some training in the team Dept too."}
{"text":"There food was amazing and the pitas was so soft and there very nice. I thought there food was very good ill def be a regular"}
{"text":"I called in and placed an order and the lady literally took 10 minutes just to take my food order. She couldn't get my name or number and cross streets right. She kept repeating herself and I had to keep correcting her. Anyhow, order was eventually placed and delivered. My family ordered the beef kabob platter and chicken kabob platter. The beef was tough and hard to chew. The chicken was dry. It was served with basmati rice. These platters, the whole thing was bland and tasteless. Salad and dressing was not that great either. We asked for the pesto vinaigrette, and it did not have any essence of basil pesto whatsoever. It was basically a balsamic vinaigrette. We were so disappointed after wasting our money. So overpriced for the quality of food. I will never order here again."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. Menu of store changed to Milanos from Pizza Bella because so many bad reviews. Pizza is so thin, barely any cheese. 3 dollar del charge plus charge for card. Only 1 dressing for an 8 dollar salad! The sweaty angry old owner behind the phone hangs up on his customers! Beware!"}
{"text":"M new favorite place! Lots of different things on the menu. Love the Italian chicken salad the best.  Great staff and nice staff to talk too."}
{"text":"I had never been here before, but my girlfriends took me here for my birthday and we all enjoyed our time here.  The bartender/ manager lady made us the best cocktails even though we weren't sure what to order, we each told her a flavor or a color and she made us the best drinks I've ever had. The food was really good too, we tried the focaccia bread and calamari for an appetizer, and I had a calzone for dinner that was so good and so big, I had to take half of it home! My friends also enjoyed their gyros and pasta dishes.  For dessert she served us all these little powdered sugar balls that I forget the Italian name for them, but they were great! She went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed ourselves and I will be back plenty more."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat it. The pizza, humus, boneless wings are amazing.  We go here every Friday night & meet friends. Best place I know of to eat w/ friends!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been delicious. The lasagna, gyros, gyro Salad, and gyro pizza, are outstanding.  The staff is above and beyond - they take a lot of pride in the restaurant and food. Would recommend for dine in or takeout."}
{"text":"This pizza is about as authentic as it gets my wife and I stopped down to grab a couple slices but when we saw the menu we ended up with a large pizza a gyro a Bella asada fries and the best canolies I've ever eaten best part it only costed about $35 inexpensive and delicious well worth the visit"}
{"text":"This place is a little overpriced. The Calamari is 9.25. So I was expecting some good calamari, but instead I got this previously frozen prebattered stuff that wasn't that great. The pizza was pretty good though, so overall 3 stars.."}
{"text":"Bellagio has outstanding Italian food. My favorite is the lasagna. A generous portion is served and a salad and some bread sticks are included. I always take home some and have a second delicious meal the next day. The staff is friendly and attentive. This is why we have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"this place is now fast food...you can have a complete unrelaxing dinner in 12 minutes.    my family just returned from a fri evening dinner...1/8 of the way thru dinner,,with 10 customers in the entire restaurant....our waitress starts bringing us TO GO TRAYS..when she now has our table completely full..she then asks me...would you like your check....YOU BET...i relayed this to the owner on our way out...all he could say was for me to come back    NO WAY  VITOS HAS MY VOTE WITH LESS HEARTBURN"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at the restaurant was about 3 years ago, I was alone and had an excellent experience with the staff and the delicious food on the menu. The next time I visited was with my wife, since then I eat there almost daily. From the owner Mike to the rest of the staff, Maria, Chris and the rest I enjoy their hospitality which in the east valley is second to none. With this in mind I find some of the post suspicious as I think I recognize two as persons working at another similar restaurants in the area.  I WOULD RECOMMEND BELLAGIO'S TO ANYONE THAT LOVE MEDITERRANEAN AUTHENTIC FOOD! ...Frank M. Miranda"}
{"text":"I'm surprised, but thankful that this place isn't more popular. Today our group of 7 walked right in for a tasty lunch. I had the gyro and greek salad for $6. Fresh, flavorful and super-filling. My tablemates ordered lasagna, beef & chicken kabobs and one of the big salad entrees. We were all happy.  We order lasagna for takeout pretty frequently...it can feed 2 easily."}
{"text":"Came here for a pizza while at the National Coming Out Day event, which celebrates the actual Coming Out Day on the October 11th. The prices here are better than the foodtrucks at the event, and they accommodate vegans."}
{"text":"Cannot for the life of me understand the less than 4 star reviews.  This restaurant has delicious gyros, pizza, woodfired pizzas, and that's just the start.  It's the best restaurant in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"ROACH INFESTED! So I decided to try this place out today, big mistake. I ordered hot wings with blue cheese dressing and a pizza. I get my food delivered,  open up the wings and blue cheese and immediately notice a BABY COCKROACH FLOATING IN MY DRESSING, thank god before I'd eaten any.  The delivery driver hadn't even been gone for a minute before I caught this and called to complain. The girl on the phone's response was something along the lines of \"oh no that's horrible\" in a completely unsurprised sounding tone. I demanded my money be dropped back off. Five or ten minutes later the owner, who it turns out was also the delivery driver, calls me back and asks \"what's wrong there was a problem with your food?\" I told him that he knew what the issue was, as I had been very clear with the girl on the phone. Then he goes on to ask \"well, where did you find it exactly?\" I lost my temper at this point and yelled that I wasn't going to keep repeating myself on the details and that that wasnt the important part, and I demanded my money be dropped back off. IT GETS WORSE! The owner comes to drop back off the money, I immediately show him the bug and hand him back all of the food, his response \"well I guess your right that is a bug\". I went to close my door on his lame and way late apology, HE ACTUALLY TRIED PUTTING HIS HAND UP IN MY DOORWAY TO STOP ME FROM CLOSING MY DOOR. I enraged opened my door back up, asked him if he actually just tried to stop me from closing my door, his response \"well I just wanted to talk to you\". After telling him several times that i didnt want to talk, that what he did was illegal, and to leave, I got to the point that I informed him if he didn't leave my property there would be a physical altercation or worse, I then had to escort him down my walkway to his car yelling at him to leave before he finally got in his car. UNBELIEVABLE!"}
{"text":"I rather enjoy Bellagio's, the owner is great and very friendly, as is the staff.  The restaurant offers Italian and Mediterranean fare, which I've experienced both, and really enjoy this place in East Mesa.  I love the pita sandwich platter, usually I opt for the chicken and hummus, and their white pizza is really good.  Great for happy hour!  ."}
{"text":"I have learned and experienced that there are occasions when our conversations are over heard in dining areas, such as a bar setting, when not always intended.  Sometimes those conversations become louder with the intensity of the conversation and may interfere with other patrons' dining pleasure.  Such was the occasion at Bellagio on 11/10.  The remarks attributed to the female bartender are not complete, as I recall them.  After the two patrons left the bar area stating that they would not be returning again given the request by the bartender to limit their conversation, the remaining customers thanked her for the intervention and her concern for their dining experience.  The request was not based on someone being a liberal, a conservative, or political affiliation... rather a regard for other customers that were also dining and having quieter conversations.  My experience at Bellagio has always been one of very welcoming staff and customer service.  I enjoy both the Italian and Greek dishes and the variety of their menu."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Bellagios almost every Friday since the second week it opened.  We have brought most all our friends to eat there for dinner as well.  They food is excellent and they have a large variety of things to choose from.  We have never had a bad meal or bad service.  They are friendly and professional.  We also eat lunch there often.  They go above and beyond to make you satisfied."}
{"text":"Oh my! Best pizza I have had in Az. Absolutely wonderful. Try the Greek pizza, it was sublime."}
{"text":"Family dinner out, three young adults, mom and dad.  Everyone was happy, service was great, very nice waiter, helpful answering questions and giving suggestions. Food was excellent. Price was right. Would recommend you try it. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE today. We walked in for our first visit. It took 10 minutes for them to even notice us and to seat us. We ordered the Meat Lasagna and  the house salad. As I began eating my house salad ...A FREAKING BROWN BEATLE BUG WITH IT'S BACK TURNED UP AND it's LEGS KICKING...was in my SALAD. My server girl with tattoos whom was so kind and went to get Managers regarding the bug. You could hear the manager lady telling my server that \"oh, that happens all the time with our salads bugs are in them from time to time just tell them we can give them a dessert\". Ok, then the male manager walked out and asked how everything was not knowing we heard the lady across the hall and asks. \"How is everything \" I said...we'll I guess everything is ok...even though it wasn't. The man BLAMES the server for the mistake but then still never offers a discount off our food or something. I'm so dumb for not taking a picture if this bug. Folks, we still had to pay $37 for a meal with a BUG in it. Wow! This was like the show kitchen nightmares. There food isn't bad it was just the principal. You know?!"}
{"text":"Bellagios is a great place for a great dinning experience.  The restaurant is located in North Central Mesa and is easy to find.  Having owned my own restaurant I can truthfully say the food is excellent.  Personally, a good Gyro is hard to find here in Mesa and theirs is one of the best I've had.. pizza is great too.  I would highly recommend the restaurant and will continue to come back for a great dinning experience.  Now if they'll only post this"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been ordering delivery from these guys for a couple months now, and we are both surprised at the 3 star average. Now, I've never been to the restaurant itself (at least not yet), so I can't speak to that, but as far as the food and delivery service are concerned I've been impressed. It's delicious, and my only complaint is that it's gone too quickly. They're never late, usually early in fact,  and are friendly and personable. Always something to look forward to."}
{"text":"Have to try their Pazuki!  Cookie with ice cream.   A bit slow on service but good food. Quiet and relaxing place.   Mediterranean platter is really good."}
{"text":"How hard is it to cook a calzone? Cheese and bread...yet, for the 3rd time in a row, I had to finish it off in my own oven when I got home. Doughy bread and uncooked cheese. The only reason they got a 3rd try was because my wife likes them and she's pregnant. She gets what she wants. But no more. We're done."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The waitress was very nice. The food was not that good though. The wood fired fresh salmon had way way too much seasoning, I had to scrape most of it off to enjoy it. It did not taste fresh at all. Cheesecake is my favorite, however first bite nearly burned my mouth. Second bite was frozen, so clearly was frozen and tried to nuke it in the microwave. Not sure that I will give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Yummy, casual, laid back place the breadsticks are worth it alone got to try this place we've driven by more than a hundred times and finally made it this night not disappointed at all!!! If your looking for a some Italian goods try this place!!! They've got drinks and salads and everything in between!!"}
{"text":"What happened to my Bellagio??? I was a regular here for years eating 4 meals a week here for awhile. Then after the owners opened the other establishments a few doors down the food quality here changed. I complained several times to the heavy set man in the back that claims to be the cook and he insisted that nothing had changed and the quality was on par. Please make an effort to be what this place once was and we will be happy to return as loyal customers. As for now our money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was fine and some of the food was ok, but my chicken was bone dry and they got a to-go order wrong.  We ordered a cheese pizza to go for a co-worker that is vegetarian but the pizza had pepperoni on it.  I tried that pizza later and it was really mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"After the closure of one of my favorite restaurants, we've made a pledge to support our local restaurants more and try different local place.  The Bellagio Pizzeria has been around for awhile, but we've never been.  First impression was great!  Very interesting decor, some cute murals with a forest motif on one wall, my girlfriend sat under the squirrel, some more typical but still eye-pleasing depictions of Greek villas elsewhere.  A very sleek looking bar area with some flat screens and cool blue lighting was in another area of the restaurant, which looked like a great place to knock back a few.  We were seated promptly in a comfy booth and got our drink order taken right away.  Unfortunately, once the food started arriving things went downhill.  Our appetizers showed up the same time as our entrees, and it took about 25 minutes to get them out anyways.  The Spanakopita ($7.00) were 5 bite-sized pastries.  Not I'm hungry bite-sized either, more like I'm an anorexic model and need to lose weight bite-sized.  The spinach and cheese inside were a very mild and forgettable combination, and most of the flavor came from the pastry itself, with the buttery layers inside being quite tasty.  Overall however, this was a very very forgettable appetizer.    Less forgivable were the falafel ($6.00) our friend ordered.  The chef somehow managed to focus all his hate and resentment against the world in hockey-puck-masquerading as chickpea form, resulting in a moment of my life I wish I could take back.  The spicy tzatziki that it came with was pretty interesting, but not enough to salvage the dish at all.  My 10'' Gyro pizza ($9.00) sounded good, white sauce pizza with gyro meat, onion, pepperoncini, black olive and feta cheese.  Unfortunately I did not detect the feta cheese flavor much, and the pepperoncini dominated the pie so that it was much too sweet.  The crust itself was excellent, crispy and darkened in some areas, but once again, the lone positive not enough to salvage this dish.  Toni's white sauce pizza with chicken breast, garlic, fresh broccoli ($9.00) was decent, but just a run of the mill generic white sauce pizza, with the broccoli being notable as adding an interesting crunchiness but not too much flavor.  Our friend didn't seem too thrilled with her gyro combo either, opting not to take it or the hideous falafel home.  So, our first foray to a new restaurant was a fail, unfortunately.  With Cafe Mix on the same corner, I don't see myself returning to Bellagio Pizzeria.  Hopefully the next new place will be better!"}
{"text":"My husband, kids, and I ate here tonight after driving around in search of decent pizza. The pizza was outstanding! The service was excellent. I would go back anytime. So glad we stumbled across this place!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place last night and the lights and atmosphere drew me in. Ended up going there the next day. Me and my friend ordered the calamari and it was straight out of a Kroger box. No tentacles or rings. Just thick pieces of god knows what. I know we live far from an ocean but you can find decent fish on this state. The salad was fine as it is hard to mess up. I ordered the chicken swarama or whatever it was called and it was not impressive. The chicken was dry but I took the leftovers home so I could at least make use of the pita bread. I was disappointed because the outside was super intriguing. The best part of the experience was my best friend and the pitcher of blue moon. The bar area was packed so stick to a liquid diet here. Even our server seemed few and far between checking on us due to lack of confidence in what she was serving. I think this place has potential but maybe as a bar with no food."}
{"text":"I'm also surprised at some of the reviews.  This place is our go-to restaurant.  We're there practically EVERY Friday.  If not, we order their take-out menu.  You have to try the chocolate chip cookie for desert, it's my wife's favorite.  I especially like the lavosh and the Mediterranean platters.  YUM!!!  Oh, by the way, the service is always 100% great!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place the  friendly people I'll gyro friendly staff amazing"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Slow as f. Beer is warm. Steer clear. Unless you are a drunka**. Then you might like it. Pizza is way over priced and mediocre at best. Many other better choices around."}
{"text":"Great place! Went here with a group and everybody enjoyed their meals. We had ordered kabobs and pizza and everyone loved their meal. The service is top notch too!"}
{"text":"The Aphrodite Greek salad here is my all time favorite. I always order take outs and my food is always ready for me when I go to pick it up. The staff are all friendly and the vibe of the restaurant is great. Also the chips they give you with the salad is bomb."}
{"text":"Great food!  Tried everything Gyro,  the bowl, salad, platter, Stromboli, and plain gyro.  The meat is crisp but moist.  I love the atmosphere and service,  they make you feel like you are in a high end place but don't charge like it.   Nice place,  Sunday evenings are quiet and very enjoyable.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to frequent Bellagio regularly. Her favorite item was removed from the menu (toasted jalapeño raviolis) but is still offered at the bar during happy hour. As of recent I have had to haggle with the staff to get them to sell me this item to go. Keep in mind I'm a customer willing to pay full price for the item. Today I called and am told I can only order this at the bar and only during happy hour. I inquired further whether or nor I could buy this to go and the staff checked with the manager and condescendingly told me no I can't buy food that they have in stock that they can easily prepare because it's not happy hour. Maybe they don't like making money, something is wrong with these people. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"If I could give a -1, I would!  We ordered pizza and were told that it would be delivered within 45 minutes.  Almost two hours later, after a couple of calls to check about when we could expect it, they finally show up.  It was delivered at 1:45 am.  By this time, we had fallen asleep and the pizza was cold as heck.  And, for the icing on the cake, they had forgotten our 2-liter drink and had to go all the way back to get it and bring it back.  Well, of course you don't want to eat your pizza without the drink.  We were staying at a hotel on the 6th floor and had to leave our room, not once but twice, to meet the delivery person because of their failure to make sure that they had everything that we ordered with them the first time!  What horrible service!  Not one time did they offer to refund our money or even apologize for the late delivery and mistake.  I strongly recommend that you DO NOT ORDER FROM MILANO'S.  On a side note:  if the pizza had been delivered on time while it was still hot, it might have been quite tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place. The gyro meat is moist and crisp at the same time and so delicious. I've had most items on the menu and found all of them to be tasty."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. That is all..the food was below average. The \"wood fired chicken\". In my fettuccine was cold....#probably frozen. The wait staff was not friendly...there were only three tables and about 5 staff."}
{"text":"Great food! We tried their chicken shwarma, falafels, and spaghetti & meatlballs dish and it was delicious! Will definitely order take-out from here again!"}
{"text":"i will say right off the food is decent,prices fair,service below average. i have been there 3 times twice for lunch once for dinner, I ordered a tanquery martini at dinner and the server said and i quote..I have no idea what that is?...............OK ........the one time i had been ther for lunch there was a staff of 5/6 and I sat at the counter and they could not figure out who was going to take my order or wait on me the third time I had a waitless toss a menu my direction and tried to crack a smile then another woman waited on me she was actually nice but when the cook brought my food out i never saw her again untill i was finished and she droped my check off lunch was good i did have to hunt down my own salt and pepper total bill 6.95ish I put a 20$ bill in w/the check and crack lady said rudley to nice lady ....THE GUY AT THE BAR NEEDS CHANGE..................nice............. the owner is always there when i have been there for lunch but seems to be numb to his business"}
{"text":"We came in on a relative's recommendation for Pizza.  We sat outside in the excellent weather.   We ordered the veggie pizza and had them add some Italian sausage for the meat eaters and it was excellent!!  Staff was very friendly and service was great.   Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have always had an excellent pizza here, take-out, and have tried many other places in Mesa - even the one on the corner of McKellips and Highly which is not as good.  We had chicken-parmigiana yesterday (eat-in) and it too was excellent, we were stuffed and had left overs!  Great fast friendly service, this in now our 'go-to' pizzeria."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and should have taken the empty tables as a hint.  It took ten minutes for my server to take my order.  Fifteen minutes later my two slices of pizza arrived.  Calling it pizza is a compliment and calling it horrible is an understatement.  It was flavorless dough topped with cheap sauce and cheese.  When it was time to pay my bill, my server was nowhere to be found.  I asked another employee for my bill and was given an attitude.  After another ten minutes my server reappeared with my bill. Overpriced garbage with terrible service."}
{"text":"My wife really likes the gyros here, I'm not familiar with them so can't speak about that.  I ordered the fried calamari as the entree and I think they were just ok.  They don't come with tartar sauce and when I asked for them, they said they didn't have any.  The marinara sauce was just ok.  Service was probably 4 stars, but the food was sooooo slow to come out and it wasn't really that busy for a Saturday night.  We may be back, because my wife likes this place, we'll see if they fare better then.  Also, this place was filled with 60 somethings on a Saturday night, we were the only people not in that demographic."}
{"text":"Good spot for a sit down lunch with a ton of menu options. You can choose anything from pizza to gyros at a decent price. My work generally has going away luncheons there as they can accommodate larger parties. The service is a little slow and it always takes forever to pay your check. The décor seems a little off for the type of cuisine, but can't complain with the clean space."}
{"text":"Wow. (2) 10 inch pizzas and appetizer is 50 bucks?!?!?!? That order call did not last long. The pizza is not even that great! Let's see how long they stay in business.  Barros pizza it is."}
{"text":"Good Italian restaurant. Drinks were good and so was the food. Only issue was that the kitchen sends out a plastic tub of dipping sauce for the appetizer of fried zucchini. When I asked for more sauce after we finished 1/3 of the zucchini, the waiter said he would have to charge me for a side of dressing. What! Your kitchen chose to send out a small plastic dish of sauce for a plate of zucchini and it is my problem? I didn't like that."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a try, I called in, and even though they are 5 blocks away, I'm out of their delivery range.  5 Blocks kinda threw me, Guess business is good that you cant drive more than 4 blocks. My bad."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but, I was unimpressed from the moment we stepped into the restaurant. We got there right at 5pm. Only 1 person was eating in the dining room and 1 person in the bar. The waitress was dealing with a Togo order and ignored us. So we took a menu and began to look at it. She quickly said, \"that's the lunch menu, you need the dinner menu\". Then she continued helping the lady with the Togo menu. So we picked up a dinner menu and looked at that for another minute or so, while still standing at the door. Finally she was done checking out the lady with the togo order. I thought, Now we can be seated, right? Umm, No. The waitress picked up the ringing phone and took another Togo order. Are you kindling me? I was ready to walk out, when the bartender came over and sat us. The bartender also got us our waters.  We then waited for our waitress to take our orders. We had to ask the busboy for bread. The waitress heard us ask for bread and stomped over to our table with it. She finally took our order. She was snippy and unwelcoming. There were now only 3 small tables of customers in the restaurant, so not sure why she was flustered and being a complete B**ch, but she was. So, she brought salads out after 5 min. Salads were small but good and fresh. Bread was good. Waitress came and picked up our salad plates and asked me to take my fork. I was in the middle of a conversation with my guest, so I was confused on why I was suppose to take my fork. She said again, \"take your fork.\" I asked her why. She said, \"well, you will need it for your meal\". I asked her to bring me a clean fork for my meal. By her expression, i could tell that irritated her. Seriously people. Give customers a  clean fork for each course. I couldn't believe it. We then waited 30 min for dinner to come out. We ordered spaghetti and manicotti. I had meat sauce on my spagetti but the meat was pureed in the sauce. Could barely even taste the meat. There was very little sauce on top of noodles. Was not impressed at all. Manicotti was decent. Lots of cheese and little sauce. We paid over 10.00 for each meal and was NOT impressed at all. We had to wait and flag a busboy over to get togo boxes. So the waitress comes over and asks us what we needed. Again we had to ask for Togo boxes and the bill. Still only 3 tables in the restaurant. I signed the bill and we left. Nobody said goodbye or thank you when we left. The whole atmosphere was weird there.  I think the B**chy waitress set the mood for all the staff. I will NEVER waste my money or time there again. The waitress was very unprofessional. People should not work in customer sevice if they don't like people."}
{"text":"Don't know what's up with all the negative reviews. This place is wonderful! Great service from start to finish, delicious food, and prices were very reasonable! Had a very nice comfortable setting as well. Manager even came out and introduced himself with a big smile. Also loved the free breadstick check in offer! Will definitely be back! Thanks for lunch Bellagio!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing! I had the chicken shawarma bowl and it was so good!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.. always had good luck with the food I have gotten.. I have only gotten the pitas before, so I cannot suggest anything else. The Hummus is decent, too. Reasonable prices. I have only done pickup, and they are always friendly. I would recommend"}
{"text":"Was tempted with a Groupon to try this place again since we hadn't been there for at least 10-15 years. Gave it another chance and won't be going back.  Ordered the chicken shish kabob and gyro plates.  The food was barely average.  The shish kebob looked like it was grilled, but was bland tasting and no spices.  The rice was plain, white rice without any flavoring too.  The gyro meat tasted fine. Now about the service - it was rushed, like we were bothering the staff.  Got there about 5-5:15pm and there were only 2 tables occupied.  Since it wasn't busy, I was surprised that the hostess (aka bartender) and waitresses weren't very interested in us, their customers.  When our dinners arrived, the waitress crowded the plates onto the table and didn't take away the empty appetizer plate.  No one asked how the appetizer tasted.  Ice tea was refilled once and water was never refilled.  As the waitress was passing by our table she asked how our dinner was, but didn't wait for the answer.  By that point, we were almost done with our food."}
{"text":"Came in for two glasses of white wine at the bar.....$18!!!!!  Are you kidding me?  An $8.50 glass of wine at a pizzeria??"}
{"text":"Superior service by the owners Sam & Mike. They were slammed with a party of 2 tables of 20 diners each. Mom and I walked in,  afraid that we wouldn't get served right away we thought about leaving. Sam recognized and greeted us and took our order right then and there. We sat down and within minutes Mike served us our lunch. We were in and out within 30 minutes. Gotta love a place that appreciates their repeat customers! That's what makes us keep coming back! Cafe Mix...up yours! Bellagio has you beat by a mile!"}
{"text":"Their breadsticks are so good, a mixture of a garlic knot and a breadstick. We went there for my my sons birthday, and the service was really slow. But they gave us a free birthday dessert for the whole table that everyone loved!"}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer for years now, and I love how they are always trying new foods and changing the menu items, keeping the customer interested with their great fresh products! I have been gaga for their white sauce pizzas since the very beginning, and the taboule is SO good, fresh and lots of great ingredients in it. My friend always gets the spaghetti and meatballs, and she's Italian and says the meatballs are just as good as her mom's recipe! A local business like this is essential to us, since we love supporting the community and eating healthy food, which they have a ton of. People underestimate this type of culinary delight, it is just like homemade food since it is all made fresh, and they deserve more credit for their efforts and amazing food!! PS - be wary of what some people post on sites like this, competition gets stiff and a lot of times the bad comments are not actual customers..."}
{"text":"I love when a restaurant values and appreciates your business!  Stephanie, our server, made that abundantly clear to us through her warm and sincere  greeting. Her beautiful smile and charming personality throughout the meal made for an exceptional dining experience.  Her genuine commitment  to taking pride in passionately connecting with every guest through flawless and relentless execution of every detail was so obvious!  The result is that we are now fanatical fans of Bellagio's and can't wait to return in the very near future!   Thank you, Bellagio's, for hiring such an incredibly talented server/bartender as Stephanie :-)!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Have never been here when anything was bad. They also have a full service bar.  They have Italian and Greek food. Their pizza are good and the lavosh is the best  I recommend it all ages the atmosphere is warm and inviting  Try it you'll like it"}
{"text":"We love the garlic romano pizza (especially with the thin crust, ask for it crispy), the gyros and the hummus pita. The appetizer sampler plate was a bust over all and the falafel was hard as a brick. The happy hour chicken wings are delicious!   The service a year or two ago was very good, but our last few visits have left us disappointed, hopefully they get that fixed. We prefer local, non chain restaurants like this and understand they will go through growing pains, but we do not go often because the prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Love this place. The fried zucchini is some of the best. We get the aphrodisiac chicken salad that has some of the best dressing around. High recommend."}
{"text":"The first time I went here , it was ok , the second time the pizza was lukewarm and I ordered a drink here,  they gave it to me in a bad light glass that just doesn't go over well with me, main issue was pizza was NOT HOT!!! Will never go there again"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see some of the reviews, I've been a customer for years and have always had a good experience.   Lots of selections and always good. If something does go wrong with an order from time to time, they've always fixed it ASAP and were apologetic."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, Amazing Atmosphere, Amazing Service!  We have eaten here 4 times in the past 3 weeks and it was spot on every time.  We have tried the Med. Pizza with the gyro meat and it is now my favorite go to pizza.  Also tried the Italian pizza, the Greek Salad, Chicken Parmesan, Philly Steak Sandwich, Calzone and Spaghetti.  They were very accommodating to customize the Calzone for us.  Most of the dinner entrees are big enough to share if you add a salad or soup.  I am a real soup foodie and have had 3 different ones here and each blew me away.  Oh, and love those fresh baked breadsticks!  We will be back."}
{"text":"We had great personal service. Good wings good gyro pizza and the server suggested zeppole for dessert. They came warm and we're delicious and enough to treat a party of ten. We are definitely coming back and bringing family"}
{"text":"Ordered the Gyro Salad for lunch and it was delicious. Felt it was not necessary for the waitress to keep coming over to fill the water after I had taken about 2 sips of it.  Literally get down about 2 inches and it would be full again.  I appreciate her paying attention, but then I couldn't taste any of the lemon that was in it."}
{"text":"Bellagio's was a strange experience for me. Very up-and-down.  Food: The food quality was spotty. We had the hummus sampler plate, which was very good, and my husband's gyro pizza was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately most of my chicken platter was not very good at all. The chicken was dry and flavorless, though edible. The salad was inconsistent, the tabbouleh (normally one of my favorite foods elsewhere) was far too heavy on the lemon and tomato, and the baba ganoush looked like rice pudding.  Decor: Very strange. Does everything need to be blue and neon? It was disconcerting and confusing.  Service: Extremely inconsistent. Our initial server took our drink order and then never came back. Another server got our drinks quickly and took our food order. We saw the original server once more when she offered to refill our drinks. She took the glasses but disappeared, even though the drink dispenser was only about 10 feet away. I did like the second server we got, but I was very disappointed otherwise, and I hope my tip went to the more deserving person.  I'd definitely come back to get the gyro pizza, but I think I'd get it for takeout."}
{"text":"I was really tempted to try this place because they have gyro meat available as a pizza topping. I remember having a gyro pizza once and it was heavenly. So, I decided to give this place a try. The first time I had a gyro pizza from here it was really amazing and made me feel nostalgic. I remember my uncle worked at a pizza parlor and hooked it up with some bomb gyro pizza. However, I think this place hasn't quite figured out how to make a gyro pizza.  The pizza itself is decent. For me, the sauce is nothing special and the crust is too biscuity. I feel like I'm eating a deep dish pizza due to the texture of the crust, but clearly its more of an NY style pizza. Its just weird. There was plenty of cheese and they didn't skimp on the toppings. Then what's my issue? Well, I think what happened was that they just put some gyro meat on a pizza and let it cook into the pizza. The cheese already leaves some oil in the pizza after it cooks, and the addition of gyro meat oil really doesn't make a pizza better. This problem becomes exponentially more important if you eat the pizza for leftover. Its just plain gross then. I had a few slices, and got a little tired because the gyro flavoring was overcoming the pizza.  I'm really sad because I wanted to discover a place that made a good gyro pizza. Unfortunately, the one thing that made this place unique and that could have made it stick out from the rest is something that has not quite been perfected at this restaurant. The pizza is really mediocre without the gyro topping, and mediocre pizza is not appealing at all. I feel like this is a really nitpicky review, but I had a pizza without gyro topping and it was just plain jane."}
{"text":"Their  food is of poor quality (just barely makes it safe to eat- When Mike first opened the resturant he used a good pizza cheese- last night I had one of the worst pizza.  I question him on the quality of his cheese- Many better places in the area to feed."}
{"text":"Bellagio is a very hit-and-miss kind of place. I won't make this review long, just know that on some nights you'll go and it'll be absolutely fantastic. Other nights, the food won't be good in any way and the service will be abysmal. The place used to be good almost every time, but lately, most of the times I go I leave very unhappy, frustrated by the wait staff, and still hungry because the food wasn't decent enough to eat it all. Buyer Beware: Risky dinner! Could be very good, but could be terrible!"}
{"text":"Love the gyros here. Best I've ever had. Pizza is really good too. I usually have a gyro pita & Greek salad. They probably have good other food too but I can't get past the gyro & Greek salad. Oh, if you are looking for an awesome desert, get the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. Feeds 2 for sure & maybe 4 if it wasn't so good! 11/9/17 the tzatziki sauce not as flavorful as one they use to use. Would not rate as high now."}
{"text":"We were here Sunday evening. The last few times we were here everything has gotten progressively worse. My order was wrong; had to wait for the correct lavosh to be made. The flavor was very bland. My son's bbq chicken pizza was laden; too much cheese and greasy. This is the third time orders have been wrong...either by the server or kitchen. I hope things improve...I really did like this place."}
{"text":"We love this place . Always welcoming, always good. Great neighborhood local spot. You cant beat Mediterranean and pizza and wings in one place"}
{"text":"At first I loved them, then I hated them, and now I love them again.  This visit at lunch was exceptional!  I was not expecting it to be honest.  It has been close to 2 years since I have come back after multiple times of disappointment.  We had a party of 4 and ordered the stuffed manicotti, lasagna, fettuccini with Italian sausage, and chicken parmesan.  All of us enjoyed not only our meals but the fresh and tasty salads.  The hot and fresh bread sticks come with marinara sauce and that was a nice touch.  The service was amazing!  I was very impressed with the remodeling as well.  Happy to see that they have made a come back and for that reason, I will be coming back as well."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in corner of shopping center found while on lunch break from a Sporting event so was limited on time. Upon being sat informed server we were limited on time and if we would have a problem ordering Philly Sandwich. The lovely waitress indicated we would have plenty of time, sadly time came for us to leave and sandwich was not served yet. She kindly packaged it up for us to go. Once was able to eat sandwich is was delicious in taste, I'm sure sandwich warm would have been AMAZING.  Giving 4 Stars for food, almost gave 3 for time but she was sweet and friendly. Will try again when not limited on time."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I promise you that you need to run away from this place. Don't do it. The food is abysmal."}
{"text":"The place looks good from the outside. Nice intimate atsmosphere inside. Ordered hot tea. Was told they only have one kind. Was brought a warm cup of tea with a \"value\" generic tea bag. Ordered apperizers. The falafels were dry and overcooked, adorned by small roma tomatoe ends (not even juicy middle!?) trying to mask the lack of flavour?! The chef sparkled (a frugal amount of) feta cheese to top the decorations. Ordered chicken shawarma and clasic giro. The shawarma chicken was simple unedible, comparable to boiled chicken smeared with diet mayonaise, that is the tzatziki sauce lack any flavour, no garlic traces no lemon twists simply badly put together. I can go on however I'd save my time and yours. I'd stay away it's this below mediocre mediterranean cuisine. Maybe their Pizzas are better?! Well, I don't want to be the one to test that theory.  5/13 Cyb3rc4t Jen and Geo: waitress was very nice and genuinely apologetic about the poor quality of the food (Is she used to the customer's reactions?!), we left a good tip for her, honest review for the place."}
{"text":"Well I will start with the good. A friend told me to go there and try their cookie ice cream dessert and it did not disappoint The belly dancers were pretty good too. So then we came back for dinner and our food was cold and they served other before us and the owner wasn't very friendly and was very loud, yelling at employees. So if you like good desserts, give it a shot, but not for a meal, unless maybe they just had a bad night, just one too many for me. A greek brother."}
{"text":"We normally love Bellagio's. However, today the service was deplorable. The server didn't introduce herself and we didn't even know she was our server. Then when she took our appetizer order she walked away while we were ordering the food. Then she over charged for the food and when it was  brought to her attention she said \"Oh, I gotcha.\"  When we were leaving I saw her walk up to a table that had just been sat a few minutes earlier and try to take their order only to find out they already ordered. She seemed lost and clearly didn't know what she was doing.  Some of this could be excused if the restaurant was packed, but until that other table was sat when we were leaving we were literally the only table in the restaurant.  I was just very disappointed with the visit.  The food was good as always, but the service ruined the visit."}
{"text":"We came here for good pizza. What we got was comparable to Domino's or Pizza Hut. The price was more than I would like to pay for this quality of pizza. The ambience and service was average. If this were the only pizza joint within 20 miles I would return. Since there are better quality places around, probably not."}
{"text":"I highly recommend dining at least once at Bellagio's if you're ever in the NE Mesa area.  For years, we had picked up pizzas for take-out at Bellagio's, but we never had eaten in the restaurant until recently.    Boy...we sure were sorry that we hadn't dined there sooner!!    First of all, we were greeted pleasantly and promptly upon arrival, and there was no wait for a table...even on a Friday night.  The waitress was professional, prompt, and friendly throughout the meal.  The menu was at least 4 pages long, maybe 6, and it was LOADED with a wide variety of reasonably-priced Greek, Italian, and Mediterranean specialties.   I had the chicken shish-kabob, and it was absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned.  It was generously served with Greek salad, rice, and pita.  The other orders at our table included the chicken shawarma pita, Greek gyro, and fajita chicken sandwich, and we all shared a serving of jalapeno hummus which was surprisingly mild.  Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the entire restaurant experience.  Now we are looking forward to making Bellagio's one of our regular restaurants to visit.  Reasonable prices, great food and service, inviting atmosphere...it's a rare...and I do mean RARE... and precious find in Mesa."}
{"text":"Bellagio Pizzeria is a nice place to go out to lunch if you want to get a choice of either Italian or Mediterranean.  The chicken dishes are a hit or a miss from my experiences here.  Sometimes the chicken turns out very flavorful, and sometimes its very dry.  The consistency is missing.  Nevertheless, my coworkers who order more of the Italian pasta type dishes have said they have enjoyed the food.  I don't like to eat heavier foods for lunch, which I am afraid would put me to asleep the rest of the day.  If you do order pizza here, I would highly recommend to say easy on the cheese because you will get a whole lot if you don't!"}
{"text":"Ugh, such a disappointment. We ordered two pizzas for take out on the whim of a smart shopper (or something of the sort), huge mistake.   The pizzas we got seem generally tasteless, over cooked and dull. Such a letdown considering the skipping through gold lined arch way prices we paid. I would have expected a little more culinary commitment to flavor with their inflated prices. Ended up cutting my own crust because the cheese and sauce seemed to be the only thing the cooks felt like needed to be cut in house.   Sadly I should have yelped this spot before we spent the money. However, lots of other images looked delicious but based on my taste experience I can only hope.   Lastly the concept is confusing, Mediterranean pizza joint?  I'll skip the follow up and consider what's lost already gone."}
