{"text":"UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP as of APRIL 2017  This place has really cleaned up and has a better menu."}
{"text":"Passed by on my way home and was definitely not disappointed. I ordered a large poutine...and it was LARGE! They gave me the option of having curds or shredded cheese, I chose curds. The portion was huge and was delicious! My wife and I will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu. Thanks MR Burger!"}
{"text":"Really nice classic burger (I got the bacon cheese burger) and I have to say it definitely hit the spot for my burger carving. Nothing too fancy just a really really good old fashion burger.  Props to them  The location is a very low key joint (fast and always on the go - take out only)"}
{"text":"Food is so good, they have a wide variety of food to choose from. I would say the best is their homemade burgers and poutine. Also they sell a really unique choice of drinks for example the sparkling Arizona which I love. They only accept cash here though which can kinda suck sometimes. It's located in the corner of the plaza. It's a tiny little shop with no seating. The shop is ran by the owner and his wife. They are very down to earth nice, outgoing, and funny people. It's definitely a good small business to support. I'd recommend it to every and anybody. It's one of those places you'd definitely go out of your way to eat at. It's also very affordable"}
