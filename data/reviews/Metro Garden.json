{"text":"We were really happy with our lunches from Metro Garden. Healthiest option in the food court by far, and fresh and filling as well. Lots of options for salads and wraps, which you can customize to your taste, and they were huge. Friendly and helpful staff makes th is a really pleasant place for lunch."}
{"text":"Was not the best place, I felt like the ingredients were not fresh. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and it just was not good at all. I think I should have stuck with the chicken instead. I will say that the veggie Mac and ham was delicious!! A deff must try. Other then that price was reasonable and I will be trying something different next time."}
{"text":"Had the Caesar salad and I enjoyed it. The salad was huge and reasonably priced for a mall food court. Will definitely have to try some of the other menu items next time. There's wraps, shaved ice, and pasta still left to try."}
{"text":"It is about freaking time a place like this is here. Have you seen the salads? If you are eating right and at the mall afraid of the crap choices, don't be. It is worthy. Oh ya, and do not fear the tahini dressing. It is awesome! I am gonna taste every salad on the menu."}
{"text":"Not bad...

Next to Dairy Queen, and hot dog on a stick is metro graden. Feeling sluggish already, i knew that if i had a heavy lunch from.....well, anywhere in the food court, i would probably be in a coma.

Not being a salad \"person\", i was a little afraid. Salads that are usually dry, and have no flavor...or the lettuce isnt crunchy. You get the idea.

I ordered a caeser salad wrap ($6) and added chicekn (+$2.75). They have a few different tortilla options,  i asked for spinach. 

After a drink, it came to about $10. Pretty pricey, but it is the mall. 

Honestly,  i was impressed with how well the wrap tasted. Everything was crisp, and fresh. Just enough dressing, thankfully, because the chicken was kind of dry. 

The only thing that sucked is the package. The big plastic container that comes along with the wrap, and my wrap wasnt cut, either.... so, as i pick up the entire wrap, the container just falls over, and out comes my silverware. Having half of a 2rap weigh it down would have been great.


Also, it wasnt \"wrapped\" that well.... maby things came piling out when i went to eat it, making it pretty messy."}
{"text":"I've been going here every time I go to the mall since I've started eating healthier. However, last time I went, it looked like they had closed. :("}
{"text":"There isn't many choices at galleria mall anymore so I just picked something simple and basic. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. The lettuce is very fresh and the chicken has good flavor. It came with a side of pita bread. There were many other sides available for add ons. Overall it's a good place to eat at if your trying to stay healthy."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, I had the salad \"kissed by the chef\" or something to that title. I got it wrapped in a flour tortilla with some added ham and it was delicious. The only negative thing was the employee that served us, stood and stared at us while we were looking at the menu, sort of felt rushed to choose something and he also didn't speak English fluently, I had to repeat myself a couple of times."}
