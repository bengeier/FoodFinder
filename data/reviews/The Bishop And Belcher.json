{"text":"I love bishop and the belcher  The food is good and the portions are huge. Except for the Mozarella sticks beware! It's only 4 sticks for a lot of $$. They also do take-out which is awesome I love to get the fries and onion rings for only $7 and it's a HUGE portion. I love the English style decor and cozy feel. Also, in the summer they have a kick ass patio. Can't forget to mention the super friendly staff, the other day while ordering take-out it was as if I was talking to my best friend everyone is super down to earth and friendly. There has been only a few occasions in which the server was a complete dick and I if you're going to sit in the bar and eat be ready for a long wait time. This bar is not the loud music mingling type of bar more like a nice cold beer with food down for a good talk type of bar."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 5 stars. The service and atmosphere were amazing. We just thought the wings could be less dry and more saucy. Not sure why they make them this way. But despite that we will absolutely go back! Maybe the wings will improve..."}
{"text":"The worst.  Service  sucked.  Dirty glasses. Attitude. Servers don't know how to spilt bills. Noting in the area,  I guess that's the reason is its here."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the money. Roast beef Sunday is amazing   I'm eating off the Church Street strip for now on. Also. Try the Friday platter. It's for 2 but will feed 4. Again excellent value."}
{"text":"Make sure your wings are cooked on Wednesday nights, ours were served half raw."}
{"text":"This place has the best day to day specials in the city. My favourite days are Thursday's, Saturdays and Sunday's.   On Thursday is Mucho Nacho night ! A huge platter of nachos is only 11.99$ and it's enough to share with at least three people. Saturday's - go in after 3pm and get the BIG BELCH! It's so much food. You Can share it with at least 4 people and the price cannot be beat 19.99$ and you can add another pound of wings for only 3 bucks. Sunday's - you can get 2 pounds of wings and frings (onion rings and fries) for 12.99$.   I save my cheat nights for this place. It's great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They have a drink deal and food deal each night of the week, so on Tuesday I went for a Bud Light and the Pad Thai with mild expectations and I was shocked by how good it was. I have had not so great Pad Thai from pubs before and this was by far the best pub Pad Thai I've ever had. The atmosphere is great with a nice warm pub feel and the shelf of board games is a nice bonus. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why have I never been to this place until now?  Went on a Thursday for wing night and was totally impressed.  The price was great and the buffalo wings were tasty and crispy, without a lot of sauce.  We also had the nacho fries which were so wrong and delicious.  I liked all the neat different places to sit, but what really sold me was the selection of board games and the Trivial Pursuit cards on every table.  The service was also friendly.  This is a fun place to relax and unwind."}
{"text":"The Bishop and Belcher has been a regular stop for me since it was located on Queen Street many moons ago.  They serve your quintessential British pub grub.  It's not healthy, but it sure is tasty.  The drinks are well mixed, and there is a large number of dishes on the menu to chose from.  The party platters (ie The Big Belch) are fun to order because they offer an assortment of appetizers, but only if you have at least 3 VERY hungry people.  The platters are quite large.  I think my only complaint about the B & B would be that I'm not crazy about their coffee.  It's often very busy after work because of the business crowd, but it doesn't seem to affect the service, which I've found to be consistent and attentive.  I've also never had to wait for a table.  One nice thing about the B & B  is that they have Trivial Pursuit cards on the tables which are fun to go through.  There are other games available as well, although I've never played them."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when I was dog sitting for my sister (she lives in the 'hood\").  I remember it from back in the day when it was on Queen Street.   However, I'd say that the new place is great. It's a good place to actually hang out with friends and just chat it up over a good selection of beers.   It is NOT however, a good place to try to watch the game unless you want to sit at the bar.  Also the curries are AWESOME."}
{"text":"I occasionally come here to meet friends for lunch since they work in the area.  Service is usually friendly and efficient,  but at times can be slow. Food is standard pub fare with a variety of other cultural food items and they have many beers on tap.  Certainly something for everyone's palate and all reasonably priced. Plus they have daily specials available.   Today being St. Patrick's Day they had a lot of tables reserved.  Luckily,  my friends came early around 11:40am and had no issue being seated in the nook by the entrance.  The server we had must be new as she seemed flustered when taking our orders and this was only the start of the lunch rush when the place wasn't even busy yet.    Service was beyond slow today. My friends only received their beers shortly before I arrived and they told me it took over 15 minutes.  I ordered my beer and it took just as long as well.   We were a table of three and everyone seated around us were tables of twos.  Somehow they all received their food and finished it before our food arrived. We waited almost an hour for our food! We didn't order anything fancy....burgers and Sheppard's Pie which are standard pub fare.  Our server did come by once to apologize for the delay with our food blaming it on the printer being out of paper? In addition, my second pint arrived well after my meal was served.  Just astonished that everyone around us finished their meals when we just received ours, plus the fact  we arrived before they did. Why did our food take extra long?  I did take a peek into the main dining room and it wasn't busy as I expected for being St. Patrick's Day.  Thankfully, my friends weren't in a rush to get back to the office except one of them had a meeting at 2pm.  Since we were extremely famish when the food arrived,  we ate rather quickly.   Good thing there weren't any issues with the food or else we would have given up and just had our liquid diet for lunch. No attempt to reduce our food bill or compensate us for our long food wait, but our bill did arrive extra quick.    Overall,  good place for standard pub food in the area.  Am sure this was just a one off, so I will dismiss it because service is usually pretty good since we're in and out of the pub within an hour.  Looking forward to warmer weather because they do have a decent patio and I will probably be back to meet friends for lunch again."}
{"text":"food was so-so...good fish, chips soggy and coldish....waitress stand-offish. won't go back."}
{"text":"In order to post this review I had to give 1 star. I don't know where to start on Friday night after work we went to this place. Waiter was extremely rude all the time any time we need sth he says I can't do 7 things hold, I will be back bla bla bla. We order some shots actually 3 people ordered 2 different shots and then other part of the group wanted to order shots he comes and says I can't serve because I have smart serve bla bla we tried to tell him that different people are ordering but ofcourse he was busy he runs away again. I wonder what the hell he was thinking when we brought the first shots to the same person suddenly he became so respinsoble. Sorry but bullshit!!!He was busy. When it came to the bill, he couldn't remember we all had extra shots on our bill plus when we try to correct him he became extremely rude. I don.t know how these people got a job of course he got 0 tip from maybe 10 people. It was the worst experience ever.. We won.t fo back to that place ever again if you want to ruin your Friday night I believe thay guy will do this best to do that."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed it. I have been here for both lunch and for dinner! (I definitely recommend the Shepherd's Pie at some point!) Food always came fast, and service has always been good. It's not INexpensive but it's delicious and seems very consistent. I love the British Pub decor- I would highly recommend it as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch place.  Cool English style looking bar, leaving it on the darker side.  It has a decent selection of bar food.  Hard to find anything healthy on the menu though, but there is some stuff if you are health conscious.  The waiting staff is a little rough around the edges here, and could use some couching on checking in on the guests.  I waited 15 minutes before I was offered a refill,  The waiter was friendly though, and that goes a long way."}
{"text":"$20 for 3 appetizers after 3pm. Nachos, Calamari and Veg samosas. Classic pub food; filling and satisfying. Their selection of Beers is great. How can you ever knock a place that has Weihenstephan on tap!"}
{"text":"I love going to bishops with a group of friends, especially in the summer. their patio is very cute and cozy. on every table they have a pack of trivia cards and a whole separate area for games that you can play!  (great convo starters/ entertaining drunk fun) Usually have daily specials, their menu isn't anything extraordinary but pretty satisfying. definitely suggest a visit. :)"}
{"text":"This pub has surprisingly delicious food!!! Surprisingly because pub food is usually just okay. We go all the time for Sangria night. We love the Chubby Chicken Burrito, the Burger with the caramelized onions, the Perogies and I really like almost all the salads.   Because my spouse and I live in the area, we intentionally go after 7 because then all the corporate workers have gone home and the pub is empty. Before 7, it was always packed!"}
{"text":"All I have to says is: $13 FOR 3LBS OF WINGS ON WED! Great deal, went and stuffed my face full. Wings are ok, not amazing, but not terrible. Service was ok, no complaints. Great place to hit up with the boys after a game or something!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I was here once and will only ever go once. Skip this and go to Fionn MacCools on Bloor instead."}
{"text":"A very average pub which mainly caters for the after work crowd. They always have food specials here, but the quality and taste is nothing to write home about. The portions are huge, however!  On the upside, they have a really nice patio with cushioned chairs and lots of umbrellas. It doesn't seem to get too much sun though, as it's located in between two rather tall buildings.  Worth a trip if you are in the area and want a cold pint, but don't be in a hurry as the service can be quite slow, even when it's not very busy."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than we wanted a quick drink on a patio in the Bloor and Church area and this place met the criteria: friendly, easygoing service, nice outdoor seating area with available seating We had an old fashioned ($9.95) and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc (8.95).  My drink was very well mixed and the wine was apparently very good. I will definitely go back to check out the food."}
{"text":"Great place to hang and grab a drink. Great service! Menu could use an update. There are specials on certain days that you can't get on a regular day. But everything is great. Just hope they close at 2 instead of 1am on Fridays."}
{"text":"Great place, especially on Wednesday wing special night.   Staff is friendly, lots of TVs for the sports crowd but quiet enough you can still talk"}
{"text":"HUGE portions American style portions. Bishop is generally busy for good reason, they have good food which is reasonably priced. The daily specials are crowd pleasers and usually paired with a decent drink special. They have a nice patio, and are dog friendly with water bowls for the pups on a hot day."}
{"text":"This is my boss's favourite joint.  When we go out for lunch, I know we're going to The Bishop & The  Belcher.   Regrettably we're both creatures of habit and every time we've come here we've ordered the exact same thing. If they're going to make it consistently good every time, why not continue ordering a dish that we know will be good?  What I order:   1. Chevre Salad (14.95+ 6.95 for steak) - baby arugula, baby spinach, romaine hearts, crumbled goat cheese, fresh blueberries, strawberries, house made candied pecans, topped with honey yogurt dressing. I've always added an order of a AAA NY medium rare steak and avocados on the side. They've perfectly seared the steak each time we've come here. Although the size of the steak often varies, the portion is sizable as an addition to the salad. Greens and fruit have always been fresh.   The boss's order:  2. Butter Chicken Thali (14.95) - butter chicken, curried mix vegetables, green salad, fried rice, vegetable samosa, rata and mango chutney all set up in a traditional platter. I haven't tried the dish myself, but the look of content on my boss's face sums up the same feelings I have towards my salad. Prepare to loosen your belt if you eat this meal, the portion size of this meal is larger than most dishes.  Other notes:  They have beers on tap, large tv screens and the house isn't too packed at lunch. Patio is opened during the summer. Only caveat, this is a sit down location for lunch, expect to take a long (maybe even a liquid) lunch when you come here."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have visited many times for lunch as well as after work.  The blue cheese burger is great, but otherwise the rest of the menu is nothing to write home about. On Wednesdays there's a wing night with 3 lbs of wings for $11.95. This is a great deal and the wings are decent.  In terms of beer selection, I would say it's adequate, and the overall atmosphere of the pub is great. Also, the patio is a great place to relax in the summer.  What's annoying about this pub is that it's often hard to find a table."}
{"text":"A decent pub to go to if you're looking for a more quiet and peaceful place to eat.  It's a lot less rowdy than most of the busier pubs around the area and in the summer there is a nice patio outside to have your meals as well.  They have daily specials and usually a special for drinks as well.  It's usually a bit busier in the spring/summer, but it seems fairly easy to get seating most of the time.  The food is your typical pub menu, but they have a lot of specials you won't find at Jack Astors or Earls.  I've had the liver, bacon and onion meal here and it was great.  Even having it the day after as leftovers was quite delicious as it's a fair bit to eat in one sitting.  Their wings are also pretty decent, although not as crispy as I would like, they get the job done.    There are also various kinds of Asian inspired foods and of course burgers, sandwiches and various appetizers.  I'll be coming back here again for a pint and perhaps try the fried dill pickles next time!"}
{"text":"The Bishop & Belcher is a great little find when you're in the village and want some cheaper than average pints and decent pub food. Their menu is HUGE and although I've only sampled a few of their vegetarian entrees, my dining companions have always enjoyed their food. Nothing out of this world, mind you, but decent food.  My favourite things about this place: - really great wait staff, very attentive and always willing to recommend something (and it's normally spot on!) - the only patio i have ever found anywhere remotely near the gay village that had seats at pride - big, comfortable, roomy patio - board games!  Least favourite things: - the beer selection has become more run of the mill lately - the after work crowd sometimes give me odd looks when my friends and I talk very loudly about things that wouldn't garner a second glance just a few blocks south of there. however, this part is also kind of fun.  The food isn't so great so as to earn a special trip but if you're in the 'hood anyways it's worth checking out.   (Please note: if their beer selection gets anymore boring I may have to downgrade my review to three stars)."}
{"text":"Decent pub grub. Came here last week for the 2lb wing special with pints. The wings were good (hot was more medium) and came with some sliced veg and fries. All for $15. Decent selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently went here because we keep getting coupon booklets dropped into our mailbox as we live nearby. Neither of us are drinkers so don't look to this review if you're planning to come to this place for drinks. We simply came here to see what their dinners were like and we were quite disappointed. While the food isn't absolutely terrible, I've generally experienced a bit better from pubs in the city. We also found the servers to be very slow and they seemed to be more into socializing that serving. They are nice and polite but only when they finally took the time to come see if you needed anything.  I'd honestly suggest you walk over to Church street where you'll find much better pubs to visit!"}
{"text":"Ah, the Bishop and The Belcher... you and I my friend(s) go back to those days where you use to laid back chillin' on Queen St. just west of John Street. You were a bit of a dive back then, don't get me wrong, you still are. You have just grew up a little, you know,  after setting yourself rather comfortably inside an office building.  Heck, I could walk by you and not even notice a pub existed there if it wasn't for your summer patio. Also, your demographic is a bit different now, thanks to that office building.   To be honest, The B&B looks like your regular British pub. Not much different then, well, all of them. The one thing setting them apart is their respectable collection of board and card games which are free for the pickings. The drinks are reasonably priced and my event members have mentioned the food to be 'fine.'   So more often than not, you will find people hanging out, having a few drinks and playing Jenga (a la Snake N' Lattes) and that gives the place a more friendly and approachable vibe than say, a Fox and Fiddle.   Personally, over the years, I have hosted a number of events here and I have had no major complains or hiccups. Well, except for that one time someone (likely from the staff) stole my 'Stephen King: On Writing' book from the bar, had it for a few weeks, read it and finally returned it along a note!* ( http://alas.bz/z )  Well, I guess since it was finally returned and the knowledge was shared, then I deemed it no long term foul. :P   Anyway, I have gone back many times since then and if you are in the area, you might want to give the place a try specially for the narrow yet nice patio. Specially if you live in the hood.   Although IF you live in the hood, then you know your other real option in the same category is Spirits, across the street, which is also a great place but that's for another review.     -------------O--------------  * The ACTUAL note I found inside the book after it was returned:  'To the owner of this book,  I would like to offer my sincerest apologies for taking your book home. It sat in the back for a few days and the book had pigeon(ed) my interest, so I figured I would take it, read it, and bring it back. I meant no harm and I am sorry. Enjoy it Sir, for it is rightfully yours to enjoy.  From, The Book Thief'"}
{"text":"I have been pleasantly surprised by the Bishop each time I go there - it is a very good pub. The servers are good and occasionally fulla sass (always a plus) and definitely pros, not to mention patient.   During the week the vibe is rather corporate-like (given that it's right next to Church & Bloor, that's no surprise) but they still have a neighborhood feel which is definitely welcome - this comes out especially after the suit crowd wanders off around 8pm and the locals and regulars stick around.   The prices are really good, considering the location (jugs for approx. $17) and the selection is good as well. And while the beer is good, their food is fantastic - big menu, and it is definitely a step up from the usual pub fare. I mean, the menu looks like typical pub, but when it comes out ... well, like I said, I am still pleasantly surprised.  The best thing about this place is that it is cool - not hip or anything, but definitely not pretentious, and everyone who works there knows they and their pub is good, and they don't need to show off. Maybe it has something to do with it being one of the most unapologetic pro-British pubs in Toronto - happy hour is called \"Loyalist Hour\". No joke. And even if you're not a fan of the Queen, you'll still like the place. Go!"}
{"text":"Your average neighbourhood bar. Food is a bit blend. I had the beef fajitas and the beef was over cooked but still edible. If ur already close by and need a drink, this place isn't bad, but I wouldn't make a special trip just to check out this place"}
{"text":"GET THE HANGOVER BREAKFAST.......don't be dumb, just DO IT.  seriously tho, underrated brunch at the Bishop, my girlfriend and I frequent,  always happy with the quality of food and the speed of service; not to mention the staff is always knowledgeable of the menu, polite, its clear that they have all served for a bit and know how to please :)"}
{"text":"Have been here now 3 times have enjoyed the food each time.  I come with my friends and we share the food.  Today had the burger with blue cheese was so good.  But instead of the fries i had the soup which is homemade the turkey(last time had chicken asparagus which I also enjoyed). The chefs here seem to have world flair to the dishes.  Even their fries seem so good they change the oil often.  My friend had the Lamb roti this time was so flavorful.  So far i have not been disappointed with the food.  The portions are a very good size and the prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I live very close to the bishop and belcher and have never been disappointed by the food, service or atmosphere. This place is packed after work and for games.   The menu is surprisingly huge and they have a great feature on every night (my favourite is their Thursday nacho night where they do their spin on Asian nachos).   All of the food I had has been great, they have some cool salads that don't lack flavour or excitement. The wings are good as well as their burgers. Definitely a great place to grab a quick bite to eat and watch the game or to come with a group for a cheaper night out! Family friendly as well:)"}
{"text":"I'm growing a little tired of pubs attempting to be British Pubs yet not offering any unique features.   The beer is all mainstream beer other than one tap from England, and the food is average at best. The wing specials here aren't bad but if you're looking for anything other than fried wings/fries, I feel it's over priced.   Not a bad place for a beer, service is actually great, but the foods overpriced & in my recent experiences hasn't been fresh at all.   If this is all it takes to be a busy weeknight pub in Toronto the standards aren't all that high."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and have found myself in here when I'm craving a cold  pint on quite a few occasions and would prefer not to walk further than 2.5 feet out of my backyard (damn you, Canadian winters..) I've come to the conclusion that this place is good for just that... cold, cheap drinks (they have pretty decent daily specials) when you're trying to catch your fav game or hang with a few friends. They even have board games and load of tvs with views from all over the room so if you had to catch more than one game, I'm sure it would be possible here.  I've made the mistake of coming to this bar when I'm craving greasy, hangover food you would expect to find in a place like this... both times, the service was a little slow (friendly, though) and the food made me not want to eat here again. The menu is extensive... huge variety of choices although there wasn't much that jumped out at me and sounded delicious. Last night, quite a busy football Sunday, I settled on cheddar and potato perogies (topped with sautéed onions and bacon) and a side ceasar salad. The food took a while...not overly long where all we were talking about is where it was...but enough for me to wonder a few times (I was only with 1 other person). I wasn't satisfied with my dish and finished only about half of it - the salad was clearly sitting under the heat lamp in the back for at least a good 5 minutes as it was warm and soggy (come on BOH and FOH...rookie mistake) and the perogies were just soft and soggy also...I couldn't pick a single one up with my hands as it broke instantly. My buddy enjoyed his bangers and mashed though...the potatoes and gravy were on point :) (The wings I had last time sucked too :()  It took us a while to flag the waitress down to clear the plates and grab the bill, however, we weren't in any kind of rush so I wasn't really bothered by that but it was a good 25-30 minute process...   Final verdict based on a few experiences - I'm sticking with the cold drinks and I'll walk the extra couple feet for some good pub grub if that's what I'm looking for. Not worth the laziness..... lol"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened here or if it changed management or ownership over the past year, but the service has gone down considerably.    The second last time I came here, the waitress couldn't separate the bill and it took close to 30 minutes to get separate bills.  Although there was one person in our party who kept on insisting they change the bill, but still, it should have taken 15 minutes and not more than that.  I came again today and we wanted a simple lunch and be in and out within an hour.  We arrived at 12, didn't get drinks until 12:25 and then was served at 12:45, so we had to rush our meals and still didn't finish until 1:30.  It was very average at best.  The only reason I come here is because it is across the street from work and our company thinks it'll be quick, when in reality, it takes forever and it'd be faster walking an extra 5 minutes and getting better service and food.    Sorry, but the service needs to improve drastically here."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Lousy short-order cooked pub food. Nice but not huge beer selection. Place is busy because of its location, look, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We tried the Bishop and Belcher tonight.  Granted it was busy as it was wing night.  We asked the two hostesses what the wait time would be and the answer was: \"I don't know\".  Really?  So much for customer service.  We left and wont be back!"}
{"text":"Very homey local pub! Great selection of drinks and food! Good tasting food and great brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good brunch! The portion is HUGE and it is definitely worth the $. Much better than sunset grill"}
{"text":"This seems like a 3 star pub. On my first visit we had beers and some spinach dip with no complaints but nothing impressive either. But after visiting on a Wednesday for their wing night, I'm going to give it 4 stars.  Wednesday wing nights will get you a pound of wings with a large side of fries for just $6.95 and you can wash it down with $4.50 for a pint of Goose Island Honkers Ale which is their daily drink special on Wednesdays. I expected the mango habanero wing flavour to be spicier but it was still enjoyable as it had a bit of sweet and a touch of spiceyness to it.   Their beer menu is generic big brands with the exception of one craft tap which was Muskoka's Mad Tom IPA (a good option at least), but there's enough selection that you should be able to find something worth drinking. Service seemed friendly both times, so even though we're talking about a generic pub experience, it's at least a 4 star generic pub experience."}
{"text":"This was our go-to place for a quick lunch and farewell lunches for employees.  I went back here recently for dinner and it was solid.  The food is tasty and no complaints but nothing spectacular.  Food: 3/5, i got the weekend platter; more than enough food for two people. The wings were a bit dry but it was tasty.  Service: 2/5, a little weird, too much attention when not needed and nowhere to be found when you need them lol. Or it could have been coincidence  Ambience: 3/5, nice decor and better to eat outside as the inside has a bit of smell.  Price: 2.5/5, average price for a place ($15-$20 per person)"}
{"text":"It's a great spot for the concept of grab a pint and some pub type food, it's not a fine dining joint nor does it pretend to be. But the nachos were fantastic for sharing, the few bites I had of the buffalo chicken salad were amazing and the portions were giant (won't lie important after the pride parade!). Decent selection of beers on tap (I'm always a fan of more Ontario Craft but can't deny there were some quality pics from elsewhere to consider since that isn't there focus) service was good, place was clean and they will charge your phone. It's an ideal meet up spot when you want something easy going."}
{"text":"I have to give this place props for being a reliable lunch spot with really good food.  The menu is pretty varied and the food quality is WAY better than the other pub options in the neighborhood. Don't even get me started talking about crappy Jack Astor's. Just go early - before 12 noon on a weekday - to get a table for lunch.  The service is good, and the food is good.I have had Indian food, salads, burgers and Mexican dishes here, and liked them all.  In the summer, if you can grab a spot on the tiny side patio, that's great too!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Put plainly: This is pub fare done -right-.  Friendly, personable service? check.  Good beers on tap?  you got it.  Interesting menu items and special?  for sure.  Prices?  sane.  A couple of TVs here and there to keep an eye on the game, but without being a \"sports bar\"?  covered.    The veggie burger is rock-steady, you'll like it a lot.   My dining companions loved the soup and fish & chips.  I don't do five stars a lot, but I think this place deserves it.  But..... ehhh, is there a nice way to say this?..... This place is for full-grown adults who want to sit down and have a great meal and drinks with their friends & coworkers.  If you're a buff-broski looking for a place to get your buzz on, take a pass on this place and go to Spirits across the street instead.  This isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for their wing special,, 2 pounds of wings, half fries half onion rings with veggies and dip. This came to $13 but you have to purchase a beverage. If it wasn't for such a great price I'd probably give this place 2 stars. The wings were average at best, Personally thought a little over cooked. Found the onion rings and fries good but again nothing special. Why i'm giving this place 3 stars is that you get such a huge quantity of food for a great price. So i'd say if your going to try The Bishop and the Belcher go on a Sunday or another day they have a special."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and find the food consistently bland, but good sized portions. The service is quick and friendly. Typical fake pub set in an office tower.  I don't go here anymore, although I'd stop for a beer, but not for food.  Generally, the clientele consists of business people or local condo dwellers, depending on the time of day. The location is convenient at Church and Bloor, close to the Yonge/Bloor subway."}
{"text":"In terms of quality, value and service, this place is hard to beat. There are awesome deals every day of the week. My favorite food there hands down are their wings. I've tried over 5 different flavors and they're all delicious. On Sundays they have two pounds of wings, fries, onion rings and veggies for $14.95. It happily fed two people. Alexander Keith was $4.50/pint and Creemore Springs $5.50/pint. Their ribs are really good and you can get the wing and rib platter everyday for $18. Least favorite are the nachos. If you like darts, you can play here for free."}
{"text":"This place has the best Fish and Chips I think I've ever had. The fiance and I found it while exploring Toronto on what could be called or first date. It is charming and has Trivial Pursuit cards on the table, score!  The entree consists of: Battered Cod Fillets: Great Batter,  golden brown and a little fluffy. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. French Fries: Great Fries! Peas: I saw the plate come out and thought \"eww,\" but they were tasty and really went with everything. Tarter Sauce: Great, nice and tart.  Here is the breakdown:  * Wait staff: Great really nice, but hey aren't most Canadians? * Drink Menu: Soda, Beer (great beer selection) * Menu:Fish and Chips, Pub type Food * Parking: Walk, I don't remember many lots and street parking looked sparse. * Dress: Casual"}
{"text":"This place is a religious friday habit at my previous job. Since we were a 2 second walk from this place and the food never let down. The lunch rushes are insanely busy which turns the servers into robots and the kitchen staff into head less chickens.   So the favourite around the house were the chicken fingers.....totally pub but the chicken finger here are just awesome...tossed in some wing sauce and your good to go. They always have daily specials (which run out quickly so if you get there past 1 ur screwed) that often sound delish but they mostly hit or miss. The taco salad is another one of my favourites. It comes in this big tortilla bowl with guac and salsa on the side to dip your tortilla in...wicked. Its just full of chicken and goodness lol. The wrap they have is another good one, and the wings you can not go wrong with.   for apps....KETTTTTTTLLLLLEEE CHIPS PLEASE!!! best best best kettle chips and you get a nice large portion with three sauce for diping, curry, chipotle, and dill...all are really god but my fave is chipotle! They also have extremly good large onion rings. The other thing that is my fav but very hard to find a well made one in toronto is FRENCH ONION SOUP! The do it really good here, the second best ive ever had (first best is at Cagney's in mississauga) and ive had alot lol.  The best part about this place is that they have games accessible to anyone, i mean like actual games, all located at the front of the place. Every table inside has trivial pursuit, but its like 5 different games cards all mixed together for variety. Often played by us at lunch or gatherings.   Downfalls: Ok so outside of the games and the good food and unforgettable typical pub decor there is a couple down falls. Some of the servers have been there for a very long time and as a result can be kinda rude since they are comfortable. But there are a few really nice ones and they make it worth going back. Another downfall is that if you go at lunch time be prepared to wait a while for you food. The owner needs to up the staff count cause the servers are all over the place and not very tentative at this time of the day and the kitchen cant keep up with the orders so food gets pumped out slowly. We have waited over an hour before for our food. Since its friday we dont care that much but it does suck when your starving.  Also, Ive gone on the weekend before and the food isnt made with as much love and you can tell. The portion isnt as grand and it just doesnt taste the same. I guess the head honcho cook isnt there to regulate cause hes slaving during the week for the business people.  Overall, The patio is wicked in the summer and its a feel good time when your with friends. There are special foods for the day and special prices for stuff throughout the week. The food is really good and i do enjoy this place. Will be going back for time to come!"}
{"text":"Jammed, not my favourite layout. I do however appreciate the wings, rib specials... Weds, Friday... Daily drink specials. It's not pretty inside, worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced food. The patio is nice and quiet. I liked the service. The place may be a bit too quiet for some people, but I love it."}
{"text":"You find that you hit the chain pubs when there's nothing else really around that tickles the fancy and you're just looking for the softer option.  The Bishop & Belcher is a decent enough pub if you're in the area and are looking for the soft option.  As British as you can be while being built into an office building, the B&B provides your basics in British fare, a good run of taps, and friendly enough staff.  The food quality is decent enough, neither offending nor exciting in equal measure.  There are tons of other pubs that provide similar fare.  There's TVs you can watch sports on if a particular game catches your fancy.  It's adequate enough.  No special trip necessary, but okay to go to if you're in the hood."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a gazillion years, but had a meeting around the corner and thought I'd re-visit, last Thursday.  Still busy and bustling, was sat at a table near the kitchen and was surprised to see a waiter working here that I hadn't seen in forever! Seeing David was a wonderful surprise and he hustled to make sure my partner and I were served immediately, and our food was brought out piping hot.  After a few drinks we had to get to yet another meeting close by, and were sent off by a giant smile and a warm hug from our waiter.  We'll definitely be back....with more people in tow! Thanks for the great service and food, B&B!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a place near your work that you can sneak out and drink at during lunch. This used to be my place to do that during the summer.  It's a basic pub, with a pretty steamy patio (during the summer, of course). The food is pub grub, but when you're drinking beer, what else would you have?   In terms of nachos-- the way I measure how good a pub is-- I'd give them a 6 out of 10, which ain't great, but good enough when you're desperate for cheese."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick pint after work. If you are in before 5pm they have half price apps and daily drink specials. The patio gets decent sun in the afternoon.  Have been many times after work and service can vary quite a bit depending on the server."}
{"text":"By far the best service of any pub on Church street.  The staff are all very attentive  and helpful.   I would prefer to watch a game here than any other \"gay\" establishment.    Food specials that are worth checking out on the menu every night.  Way better wings than Striker and anywhere else in the village.      A good mix of locals,  9 to 5ers  and the gaybourhood.  I like it.  I like it a lot.   Watch the game here."}
{"text":"This place was great back in the day when they were on queen west. The new location blows. The queen location used to have all young people and trivial pursuit at all the tables. Good music, good times. and of course, the legendary big belch platter.. had to order that every time! It really was my favourite pub in toronto for a long time.  Unfortunately with the location change, came a totally different establishment. It seems more like the kind of place where corpo's would get a business lunch now than a good bar. And now the deep fried smell just bothers me. Maybe i've grown up a bit since then. boo-hoo"}
{"text":"A good pub that has got all your staples. Good value for your money and good diverse crowd. I ate dinner here once and was skeptical that it would be good but was pleasantly surprised. A new go to for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Really really great selection of food for decent prices. The portions are HUGE! They have daily specials which are very easy on the wallet, and often includes an entree + a drink. Between 3pm-5pm daily they have 50% off appetizers with the purchase of a drink, which is a great draw for many of the visitors. The food quality is what you would expect of a pub, but it's definitely a great place to visit for a social night out!"}
{"text":"Great spot!  The Daily specials are a true deal... 3lb of wings for 8.95 is amazing!  They don't sauce them up to much so ask for extra on the side.  Service was slow on the particular night, but it was also very friendly and apologetic about the pace."}
{"text":"I have lived a block away from this pub for years, but it always seemed so hidden and ....well, I will be honest....run down, that I stalled on checking them out. Until last Saturday night. My friend and I met here for dinner, and on Saturdays they have a platter special: wings, fries, onion rings, cheese bread, chicken fingers and fried pickles for $19.95. It's a great deal actually, and more than enough for two people. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because not all the items in the platter were good. We were not fans of the cheese bread and fried pickles, and the wing flavors were so so (the soy one literally tasted like the wings were drowned in pure soy sauce - yuck).   The service was really good, and the daily beer specials are not bad - on certain days they have good beers on special ($4.50 for a pint).   And surprisingly, the inside is actually quite bright, and not as run down as I expected it to be (sorry for being so judgmental!)  Will return. :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch with the work peeps at the Bishop and Belcher, which is a very nice change from our usual haunt, The Spotted Dick.  We reserved a table for noon and our waitress encouraged us to get our orders in to get ahead of the lunch rush.  I ordered the Tenderloin Caesar salad ($13.95) and food came pretty quickly considering we were a group of 8 and it was lunch hour.  My tenderloin was cooked medium rare as requested but the salad itself was just a run of the mill Caesar.  Others in our group ordered the burger, nachos, fish and chips, grilled cheese, etc.  No complaints from anyone.  I was quite impressed with the way our waitress handled our group and the speed at which our food came.  I'm always leery about group dining because sometimes the service can be lacking but not here.  We were even presented separate bills without any commotion.  A decent lunch overall and I'm sure we'll be back for another."}
{"text":"I quite like this place.  Patio is nice and off the main road so it's a bit quieter.  Inside they can accommodate big groups and the service is alright.  Food is under rated.  Good brunch too.    My only issue is that it has really weird weekend hours.  Tends to always be closed when I try to go there.  Causes me to go elsewhere when I don't want to."}
{"text":"Pub food galore. I got the liver and onions, which came with peas and mashed potato. The last time I was here, I got the same thing but it came with a bit extra....a bit of extra plastic wrap, that is! So last time sucked, but this time it was pretty decent. Portions are large, so I can never finish it, but gives me a snack for later. I like that, since it gives me more bang for my buck.   Service is meh....they make the rounds occasionally but in certain corners of seating, prepare for some neglect. Very friendly though.  This place is definitely not my top pick for future dinners, but the vibe and friendly service bumps it up."}
{"text":"I've gone there twice and if I had a choice I would go else where. The look of the place is fine, but the food is a different story. It's average and depending on what you order it could be less than that."}
{"text":"Okay. The food is just okay, service is just okay. Prices pretty good. The inside has an old dirty pub smell. But the patio is decent. It's a good place to hit up when you want cheap drinks and food. The fish taco was alright not great."}
{"text":"There is definitely an abundance of pubs to choose from if you're in the downtown core. I am a huge fan of chicken wings so I found the wings deal at Bishop and the Belcher to be very appealing, hence why I chose this specific pub to meet up with a friend for a quick bite. The only night where the wings deal is available though is every Wednesday.   Bishop and the Belcher is a traditional British pub which you can tell from its dark, cozy and comfortable atmosphere when entering the establishment. My friend and I arrived at around 5:30 pm, and seated by one of the  hostesses. The menu isn't too exciting and just features regular pub fare, and alcohol. Unfortunately, I don't drink alcohol, so I cannot comment on the selection of the beer at Bishop and the Belcher.   The both of us decided to settle on the special of the evening which was $11.95 for 3 lbs of wings (you get two choices of flavors for each order). Just note that in order to get this deal; you must purchase a beverage, which is the norm these days for cheap wings. So we got two drinks with our order.   They also have accompanied sides available for $2.50. The choices are Irish nacho fries, half/half, poutine or jacket potato skins. We decided to get all three sides.   The two flavors that we chose for the wings were Chipotle and sticky sesame garlic. Honestly, the plate of wings didn't look like 3 lbs of wings at all, and a few pieces were overcooked. However, the wings were pretty decent and the price for the amount of wings was really good. I didn't like the fries at all; they were overly salty and not crispy at all.  As for the service, I found it fairly inadequate. I know that the place was relatively busy but some of the waitresses were just talking amongst one another near the bar area. After we were seated, no one came by to take our order until 15 minutes later. Additionally, it took the food forever to arrive at our table. The table next to us (who arrived later) got their food before us. Additionally, we were completely ignored by the waitresses who walked by our table despite seeing that we were done (by the empty plates)."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars only because of the great deals they have on food and beers. Walked in with my wife and my sleepy 5 year old for a quick bite - were impressed with their $6.5 wings deal and promptly ordered 3 pounds. Because you could get any brew for $5.5 with a food order I ordered some premium ones including a Guinness. Well my beers took time coming - about 10-15 mins after I ordered each - the first time waitress told me Guinness is a long pour so it takes that much time. My next - a miller - was delayed and I had to ask for it again this time admittedly with some sarcasm (with a smile) - \"I think this ones not a long pour\". She called me rude and at one time said I might have never had Guinness before so don't know about these things (implying I never had premium stuff and having now because it's on a deal). Now I am a brown Asian guy with a turban and was offended with her implication. I could have expressed this but didn't go that line. Irrespective, her tone was very bad towards a customer. Guess what? I was not cheap and gave her a 10% tip despite being massively disappointed. The management better try to understand why their employees are not happy here - they could land you in legal trouble if they remain as insensitive. Never coming back. (Had been here more than 10 times over a year but that's it now!)"}
{"text":"I stopped at the Bishop and the Belcher for a patio pint on one of the first warm days of the summer[*]. Armed with a Strongbow, it was the perfect antidote to the mid-week blahs. The south-facing patio gets a lot of sun and there is plenty of comfortable seating. I imagine it gets packed right after the work day (there are a lot of office towers nearby), so I'd make sure to head over early.  The inside is very pub-ly with red velvet carpeting and dark woods and I think I spotted a dart board. While I haven't tried the food yet, I'd give it a shot. I'm just that kind of a guy.  Obligatory Title Pun: Got a patio date? Why not MITRE here? (Meh.)  Menu Readability: Most un-publike. Sans serif and bright colours.  Need to mention: They have nightly specials, like humpday's three pounds of wings for $8.95. Score!  What this place teaches me about myself: Make my patio a southie.    _____ [*] Summer in Toronto must be asterisked by law."}
{"text":"To be honest, I had never heard of this place until someone recommended we meet here for dinner. Located in a modern high rise, the old English style pub ambience totally contradicts the modern facade of the building....so much so that if you weren't aware of where you were going, you could walk right past it and totally miss it (while walking on Church St). Anyways, it was \"Mexican night\", which meant their Mexican dishes were specials. For $11.95 you could have either: a quesadilla; a chipotle burger; fajitas; or a chicken burrito. For an additional $3 you can tack on a pint of beer. 3 of my dining companions had the quesadilla....they were stuffed full of chicken and came with either a salad or fries. They said it was good. I had the burrito and found it just ok. It wasn't awful, it's just that I've had better. It has a sweetness to it with zero heat. It came with fries and a salad. Portion sizes were very large. I will venture back to try other dishes as some looked quite interesting. Service was good and our waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you expect and and the British food is spot on. Well done for doing pints of Orange Juice and Sprite too!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy place at lunch and tends to fill quite quickly for good reason. I came here with a party of 6 and made a reservation which was a good idea.   This pub has a wide variety of food, mainly in the British style and has something for everyone. My coworker and I had the butter chicken and was quite authentic. The curry was less spicy than Indian cuisine but was still delicious. There was a mix of salad and came in a unique plate that resembled a bento box.   My other lunch guests got the Chili chicken and found it to be spicy, just to his liking. It looked quite delicious and flavourful."}
{"text":"Ordered bishop burger on ritual  Pros: 1. generous portion, burger comes with fries, onion ring, soup 2. Onion ring was good   Con: 1. Burger tastes burnt 2. Fries taste like it's fried with Peanut oil????? Has a strong peanut smell 3. French onion soup tastes like simply burnt onion...... I have never had french onion soup before so I can't say if it's supposed to taste like that"}
{"text":"The pub looks really good in the summer, cute patio. The food is nothing to remember, the usual pub fare. The service is hit and miss, one day this girl is chatty and attentive, another waitress on a buzy night kept ignoring our group of four because of the bigger party next to us.  If you are with a nice group of friends none of this matters much. If not, the trivia cards on the table help with the conversation toppics :) ..."}
{"text":"I am biased when it comes to this little pub. I work at Yonge & Bloor, sandwiched between a plethora of bars, restaurants and lounges that are  a. Overpriced  b. Full of snobby people  c. Packed and have terrible service  d. All of the above.  Needless to say, I was very happy when we found this little place. I've come as a group of two and as a group of 12... And everything in between. Service has always been friendly and we appreciate the drink specials before 6pm because it forces us to leave the office at a reasonable hour (though we would not complain if they extended it until 7).  Food is an upgraded array of typical pub fare - mostly importantly it is always hot (I HATE cold food).   It's friendly, casual and well priced- everything that I'm looking for after a long day."}
{"text":"Two things:  1) Cheap wing nights - they used to do 3 lbs of wings for $9 on Wednesdays. 2) Trivial pursuit and other assorted board games."}
{"text":"Staying in area and we felt like having a couple beers with our meal so ended up being walking distance from where we were staying.   Fantastic experience!  Beers were cold, staff was friendly, our waitress was wonderful. Food was delicious and atmosphere warm and cozy with fun little quirks    Looking forward to our next visit in the area."}
{"text":"Came in here after work one night for dinner. It was a Wednesday night but the place was pretty full. Upon entry there is an array of board games that you can feel free to take to back to your seat and enjoy. The hostess told us to sit wherever we liked and she'd be over.  Our small dark wood table was located in a cozy corner backing a window. The table had a box of trivial pursuit cards from the 60's perhaps? We couldn't answer any of the questions though.  After sometime our friendly waiter finally greeted us, took drink orders and left us with the menus. The menu consists of typical pub fare plus a whole section of Indian & Asian fare plus they have nightly specials.  Roast Beef Dip + kettle chips - Shaved oven roasted sirloin beef on a kaiser with aus jus dip The bun was really nice with ample sesame seeds and did not fall apart or get soggy but the beef was super dry. A little too dry but at least the au jus helped rescue the sandwich. The real winner of the entree was the kettle chips! Definitely get them as a side, warm, golden, crunchy, and super addictive.  Butter Chicken Tali - Served with curried veggies, salad, raita, mango chutney, vegetable samosa & jasmin rice. Beautiful presentation and great assortment! My sister asked for it to be extra hot and they definitely did kick up the heat. It didn't come with naan but we asked for a side ($1 more) but it turned out to be pita bread.  Dessert  Chocolate Fudge Brownie - A silky fudge brownie with chopped walnuts, topped with carmel and chocolate sauce served with vanilla ice crem. So that was the description, and the brownie definitely looked yummy but taste wise it was very disappointing. The brownie was soo hard and cold not warm at all (stale?) and they dusted it with cinnamon, I have no clue why but it just tasted awful the whole thing had a funny tast.  I liked the tea bags though, they were Tetley but came with a drawstring, I've never seen this before!  Overall service here was not great at all, I understand that they were very busy but after asking twice for a drink refill and taking over 30 mins plus mediocore food was not what I expected. However if your coming for a pint and wings (the wings looked Huge!) I'd give it a go."}
