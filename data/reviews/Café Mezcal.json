{"text":"Nice, apparently new, spot. Close to our hotel for brunch on a rainy day. Chilaquiles and huevos rancheros and coffee from the espresso machine were all good. Servers friendly and attentive too!"}
{"text":"Too tiny of a restaurant, chicken in both the mole and taco dishes were cold! Too many items on the menu for a 1 woman show to do well."}
{"text":"I ordered from Cafe mezcal through Foodora, and it has taken them 3 hours to get us our food, they won't even pick up the phone, what kind of business are you guys running? NEVER ORDERING FROM YOU AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Tiny room with maybe four actual tables.  Cozy atmosphere with good music in the background.  It felt like it could've been a café somewhere in Mexico City.  Portion was a good size, ingredients were fresh, and taste was authentic."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clearly very fresh and good quality. Prices were very reasonable, and the service was very good as well. We had the tostadas, tacos de tinga, and nachos with beef. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic huevos ranchero with homemade tomatillo sauce, black beans and the best plantains. And did I mention great coffee?"}
{"text":"My first visit to the Plateau in Montreal was highlighted by a lovely meal at Cafe Mezcal. The restaurant is located on pedestrian-only rue Prince Arthur and is fairly new. The space inside is small but very charming. I was there on a summer evening but I imagine it would be a cozy spot for a dinner in winter. I dined outside and was able to enjoy the music of a live street performer which was nice. I had the chicken quesadilla and it was great. Tortilla was delicate and the filling delicious. Price was very reasonable, especially compared to the many other restaurants on that strip, and service was friendly and good. Owner Shelia is a native of Veracruz, Mexico and is a warm and lovely host. I certainly would dine there again."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  I am not sure if it is new or not but it is very homey with a family feel. The owner is very warm and friendly. I had the Huevos a la Mexicana for breakfast.  It was very good although it wasn't very hot in temperature.  It took a while to get our orders and you had to flag them down a couple of times to get drinks since there are only 2 people working.  Its a very small place with only a couple of tables but its adorable inside.  Otherwise it was good and you do really feel like you are in Mexico."}
{"text":"Nice decor and ambiance. Great family feel. Food was ok. It wasn't in the top 25% of Mexican breakfasts I've tried."}
{"text":"Such a lovely and adorable spot ! The restaurant is quite small, with a few tables and bar seats, but they do have a couple tables outside. I love the blend of colours of the restaurant, and there's also a really pretty painting on one of the walls :) If you opt to sit outside, the tables are facing a gorgeous mural on a wall.
I came with a group of friends and we had the huevos rancheros, huevos a la Mexicana, nachos, and gringas, and also split 2 of their sweet buns to start. I had the huevos rancheros, which was 2 eggs on top of corn tortillas, with a side of black beans and fried plantains, which was good and filling. My order came with a complimentary Americano, which was served in a cute, colourful cup. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well.
The service was also very friendly and courteous, although it did take a while to get our main dishes. 
Prices were super fair - my order of huevos rancheros was only $8.50, and it included a huge cup of Americano ! 
I can't compare it to other Mexican restaurants since I don't eat Mexican food often, but I really enjoyed my meal and loved the beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Had the Vegan Pableno Taco. It was literally so good I have a hard time believing it was Vegan."}
{"text":"First time trying foodora, the service was just fine. The food, no good. 30$ for soggy tacos n wet pulled chicken. To bad i cant let people know on foodora not to order from their if their craving mexican."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The owner, Sheila (sp?), is a delightful person-- very engaged with the Latin cultural preservation community in Montreal.  The cafe has a wonderful cozy feel and the food is delicious and abundant in quantity.  You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Really good!!! This place was recommended to me by a few of my Mexican friends. The tacos are excellent quality and inexpensive. Plus, there's a lot of variety. My kids LOVE the Chicken Tingas. They also have a lot of interesting vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Small family owned spot with some outdoor seating. 

The tacos are good and freshly made. I also recommend the tostadas.

The staff is friendly, but the service needs some work. The server wrote down our orders, but they forgot 2 drinks and got 1 order wrong."}
{"text":"On m'avait tant vanté les mérites de ce café...que j'arrivais avec beaucoup d'attentes comme le dépaysement, le goût, la surprise et l'assouvissement!
Et bien je suis restée plus que sur ma faim....
J'ai teste cet endroit à l'occasion d'un brunch dominical entre amis et nous étions places sur la table qui donne sur l'extérieur et la fontaine du tranquille passage du square Arthur!
La décoration est agréable et invité au voyage!
Les brunchs ne permettent malheureusement pas de manger à sa faim...il faut les accompagner d'autres mets et je n'ai pas été aussi surprise par l'originalité et le goût que je l'imaginais!
Le service n'est pas terrible, mais il faut quand même relever qu'un seul jeune homme doit s'occuper de tout le restaurant!
C'est bon, mais il manque ce je ne sais quoi de folie qui ferait toute la différence!"}
{"text":"Super bons plats mexicains à des prix très abordables!
Pour le brunch, il y a des plats avec des oeufs. 
Nous avons goûté les Huevos con chorizo et Huevos rancheros, tout était bon. Les Huevos rancheros baignent dans la sauce par contre, on a trouvé qu'il y avait beaucoup de sauce.. Les Huevos con chorizo viennent avec des petites tortillas chaudes.
Seul petit hic, ce n'est pas très copieux; si vous avez une grosse faim, il faudra peut etre prendre un petit truc à côté..
Excellent service, beau décor, belle place! A essayer!"}
{"text":"It's a little homely place with a beautiful paint on the wall and service is good. What a 
wonderful morning to try Mexican breakfast at my first time. Fried banana was cool for me! Latte served with a really cute mug~"}
{"text":"Super cute little place! We went
On a Monday evening-the owner was the only one working and she was delightful-most accommodating to make dishes vegan or vegetarian upon request. Great selection of authentic Mexican small plates and main dishes. Our orders included the nachos, beef taco, vegetarian tostadas and huevos al gusto. Everything was prepared fresh and served promptly. We will definitely come back and hopefully dine al fresco in the warmer weather."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos ive had for a while.Sexy,Yummy with delish condiments of fresh salsa and guacamole.I had 3 and when I went to pay they were 3$!!!.It was 1$ taco day and they were amazing!I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Petit café sympa, peu de place assise. Bonne bouffe, bon expresso. Un service correcte, sans plus. Idéale pour casser la croûte, avec un ami, ou simplement lire sur la terrasse qui donne directement sur l'ambiance de Prince Arthur."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since my last review and I've sampled a variety of their dishes and they're honestly amazing. You can see that the staff really puts love into what they do, and it shows with the quality of food they put out. It doesn't hurt that their friendliness and open-mindedness makes for some great conversation with them as well. 

The renovations that they did in early January certainly helped brighten the vibe even more than before! I love that they opened up the kitchen so that customers who sit at the bar on that side of the room can see what's going on, and its beautiful blue/aqua walls lighten the mood perfectly. Food-wise, I would recommend the tostadas and enchiladas if you're in the mood for something that will easily fill your stomach, and mochaccinos during the winter and horchatas during the summer will certainly sweeten your day. (Insert fact that they give you so much more coffee for a cheaper price than other places nearby!)"}
{"text":"Petit café sympa sur prince Arthur face à la fontaine. Les plats sont servis à toute heure. Le service est correct malgré que nous n'ayons eu que 2 petites galettes par personne pour le repas. Je recommande les huevos chorizo. Dommage qu'il n'ai pas encore leur permis alcool"}
{"text":"Five of us ate here later in the evening on a Thursday night, so maybe  the cook had gone home.  They told us they did not have any more chicken or pork, or the tortilla soup.  So we did not have very much choice to make an order.  Nothing had good flavor.  I ordered something I had never heard of before, to try a new thing.  It was beans, cheese, etc on bread.  The bread was dried out, toasted, almost too hard to bite.  I asked for some salsa picante (hot sauce) to add some flavor, but it did not improve the flavor.  My four friends did not enjoy their meals, either.  The guacamole we ordered did not have any flavor of added onion or tomato or garlic or cilantro;  it was bland.  Two of us ordered smoothies and the waiter said they did not have any fruit, only the avocado.  When they tasted the smoothie, they could not drink it. It was very salty.  We saw the waiter make it:  it was just avocado, yogurt, and the white powder.  We think he confused the salt and the sugar.   He did apologize and did not charge us for the smoothies.   I cannot recommend this restaurant. All the food was poor,"}
{"text":"Excelent place! The staff is very friendly the food delicious, the best chilaquiles! I'm Mexican and I can tell this really tastes like México"}
{"text":"Wow, legit Mexican food in the middle of Québécois nation! After spending some time in Mexico and loving on fresh treats, I found myself in French speaking territory. Slightly hungover, I yelped anything that was open with good food. I came here and was super surprised at the nice composition of my breakfast dish of eggs, beans, and other little treats that felt like they belonged in Puebla and not east Montreal. Super friendly staff, great prices, awesome coffee! Come here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bilan mitigé bien que beaucoup d'attente pour ce lieu !

Le café est tout petit mais il est possible de réserver et ça c'est cool. Pour ce brunch du dimanche il n'y avait pas besoin mais au moins nous étions sur d'avoir notre table.
Les jus frais sont bons et nous rappellent des saveurs sud-américaines.
En plat j'avais pris les huevos rancheros et j'ai été un peu déçu car trop de sauce verte qui donne un goût sucré. La portion est correcte sans plus, pas énorme mais en rapport avec le prix ça le fait. Le serveur est cool et me ramène une petite portion de guacamole qui n'était pas prévus.
Le guacamole était très très bon, wahou :)
Au niveau du dessert c'est un peu la déception, presque pas de choix. Le seul dessert qui me tentait n'était pas disponible. La sorte de brioche que nous avons pris était un peu sèche. Pas folichon.
Quand on passe à la caisse la note est toute légère et ça c'est cool car cela donne un bon rapport qualité-prix pour ce que l'on a mangé.

Sur le papier j'avais vraiment envie d'aimer ce petit commerce mais là je revois mes envies à la baisse. Non pas que cela n'était pas bon mais moins à mon goût que ce que j'aurais espéré, dommage !"}
{"text":"Great taquería on Prince Arthur!

I am so happy that this place opened up recently in my neighbourhood, though seriously worried about my impending obesity. The food tastes like it comes from DF. The ambiance is so friendly (trilingual!) and the service is excellent.

They have so many specialties that you will want to try -  tacos, molletes, sincronizadas, tamales de rajas con queso, agua de horchata y tamarindo  - in addition to the typical Northern American 'Mexican' fare of nachos and quesadillas etc... At the moment, they are solidifying their menu and I hope that they decide to add romeritos, bacalao and mole verde to their taco menu. Their salsa macha (spicy sauce with sesame and peanut) is delicious.

They bill themselves as specializing in breakfast dishes. I am looking forward to trying their chilaquiles and rancheros next time I visit."}
{"text":"Super nice Mexican restaurant. Cool space, warm server, air conditioning and chilling atmosphere. 
Prices were fair as well, I paid just under $10 for a meal. 
Food was tasteful too!
They also have wifi!"}
{"text":"Went back after thoroughly enjoying my first time at this place. 

Literally everything went wrong this time and a lot of it has to do with the service. We sat down and after we were given menus, we were ignored for probably 30 minutes before the waiter finally decided to take our order. My friend wanted a pulled pork torta and I wanted a chicken one but they were out of both meats. What sort of restaurant is out of two very standard central meats? My friend switched her order to a beef torta and I got the chilaquiles.

The chilaquiles were not good at all. They were just smothered in sauce and blobs of some kind of cheese were laid on top. Not like delicious chilaquiles I've had elsewhere. My friend said her torta was just so-so.

On top of that, it took them forever to tell us to pay at the cash and then the waiter recalculated our bills like 3 times because he couldn't remember who ordered what.

What's even worse is that we both started feeling really sick towards the end of the meal. Hoping it's not food poisoning.

Unfortunately this place that had so much promise is not one I will be returning to."}
{"text":"I loved this café and I'm so glad I found it! The place is so adorable; it's small, well decorated, and authentic! The little terasse where I ate was in a super cute street, with a mural right behind. The food is delicious, and extremely affordable. I love it and I come back from time to time to show off to my friends the amazing resto that I found on yelp"}
{"text":"Delicious! As a Mexican, having a place like this where I can eat some authentic food is priceless. Best Mexican food I've had in Montreal so far."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a place for brunch and ended up at Cafe Mezcal! Prices are so good, food is even better!!! 8.50 for eggs, tortilla, plaintain, beans, orange juice, and fruit! 
Definitely would recommend, we will be coming back! 
also try their avocado smoothie, really refreshing on a nice day!"}
{"text":"Café Mezcal is many things but contrary to what it's name indicates; it's far more a restaurant than a cafe. Offering an affordable variety of Mexican delicacies, I left not only full, but thoroughly impressed. The ambiance in the early summer is magnificent with mellow music and seating on the pedestrian only street. My food was delicious and authentic according to my Mexican friend who accompanied me. Lastly, the service was impeccable with a friendly server chatting in Spanish with her customers and efficiently taking orders. Café Mezcal manages to transport its' patrons to Mexico through its cuisine, impressive beverage selection, and ambiance. Closest Metro is Sherbrooke on the orange line."}
{"text":"This is a really small family owned business that serves tasty homemade-like meals. The prices are reasonable, and most dishes include a juice or coffee. The taste was not amazing and the dishes are simple, but it hit the spot for me on this particular day. 

We ordered three tacos, the huevos rancheros and one horchata. 

The Good:

Reasonable prices (under $10)
Good and efficient service
Accommodated my no onion request
Nice homey vibe
Food was tasty

The Not-So-Good

The pork was dry
No toppings for the tacos
Out of tamales

So if you are craving a home style meal like I was, definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Very good food and good price. Although the food was not very hot and our chicken enchiladas were late. We did not complain but They gave us the enchiladas for free which was very nice of them. Nice ambiance. Great coffee & hot chocolate."}
{"text":"One of the few places on Prince Arthur that doesn't make me want to puke. 

$12 (before tax and tip) got me a big bowl of guacamole, 3 tasty tacos and a refreshing glass of horchata (rice milk, cinnamon, etc - try it). The service was fantastic and the food felt authentic. There are also a few tables set up outside if you feel like people watching... or looking at the fountain... whatever you're into. 

All in all, a fantastic experience. Can't wait to try their huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"I had the tostadas with chicken and they were fresh and lively. Two of them made a perfect light lunch. I had a sip of the avocado smoothie and it was good. Too bad the place isn't licensed because a great sipping tequila would have brought this experience to the next level. Having said that, it is a cute place with a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Petit café mexicain sympa, avec terrasse donnant sur Prince-Arthur. On y propose de la nourriture mexicaine bien sûr, des tacos, aux tamales, aux quesadillas, aux huevos rancheros (7$) pour le petit déjeuner. Ils n'ont pas encore leur permis d'alcool. À défaut, ils proposent des smoothies à l'avocat, cafés et jus. Prix abordables. Service sans plus du jeune serveur. J'ai bien aimé, le fait de manger sur la terrasse avec la petite fontaine en face, sympa, des airs de vacances. Je reviendrais pour essayer les tacos avec une corona, lorsqu'ils auront leur permis d'alcool. Wifi gratuit. Carte de crédits acceptées.

4/5 visité en juin 2015."}
{"text":"Service was great, family run place where grandma cooks everything in the open kitchen, felt like being in a warm family's dinner room. Only a couple simply decorated tables added a great touch to the cozy atmosphere. The food. Well that was my worry; we were on Prince Arthur. We had the chilaquiles that was mild and tasted like home cooked food nothing fancy. It was a mild green chili with nachos and chicken, the flavor mix was perfect, the crunchiness of the nachos balanced the softness of the chicken. I was not disappointed, but shocked that mild flavor Mexican food can be surprisingly tasty. Even in Mexico I only had very strong tasting meals. So I was looking forward for the other items to come. Came the Tortilla soup, because i had very good tortilla soup before, this one disappointed me it lacked intensity,spiciness, tartness, it just lacked fragrance. Then came the tamales, it wasn't as good as others i had a bit on the dry side with some simple cream and cheese toppings. To compensate all, the service was excellent, the waitress also a family of the business was very caring and offered me 2 sauces because i told her i can take spice. So please come to this place with an open mind and put away your expectation of your previous experiences and this place will charm you."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food (and affordability) in Montreal!!!

I've lived in this area for a year, and can't believe I haven't gone to Cafe Mezcal! It's located where there is an abundance of street music so you can sit outside in the sun and eat (which is what we did) and it was really relaxing and awesome!

I order the pulled pork tacos and wow, they were so tender, juicy and just the right size for a meal! Also, I hate when food gets too greasy, and surprisingly the pulled pork was just the right amount of savoriness and not greasy! We also got a side of refried beans, guacamole with chips and they were very good. The chips are homemade so they are harder, but minimal ingredients were used so that everything tasted fresh. Honestly, even without the great price, I would have rated them 5/5 just for their nice service, fresh food and atmosphere but dayummmmmm the total came out to only ~$12 for a main menu+appetizers which is great when you're poor af (aka college student)....Honestly, you can't get a better deal. 

I will probably be coming here....very often.... ugh RIP my already depleting wallet but YUM"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is super friendly and the dishes are delicious and very affordable . Highly recommend this place. Great place for brunch too!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot in a prime area of Montreal. Food is good, affordable and the ambiance is quaint. Enjoy the view if you choose to sit at the window. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the cons:
- These guys are slow, like really slow, even by Montreal standards. If they say 15 minutes, rest assured it's always at least 45.
- If you order takeaway, be prepared to make at least one trip back to fix problems with missing items etc.
- Quality changes literally every time you go. Best example is chips: sometimes they are divine homemade chips, other times... Tostidos.

But... the pros:
- Food - 90% of the time at least - is simply divine. Their pan-fried burritos and quack are just perfect. Disgustingly greasy and oozing with cheese... just the way they should be!
- Atmosphere is very nice. This place has a really welcoming vibe.
- The flan - when they actually have it - is ridiculously good.

While normally the cons would make me look at stars in the range from 1-3, they more than make up for it with how ridiculously good the food is, most of the time."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab breakfast with a ton of vegan and vegetarian options. Food tasted good!"}
{"text":"Authentic,warm, chill and affordable ,that would be the short version of a description for this little slice of Mexico in Montréal.  I have been a fan of Mexican cuisine for a long time now, but have yet to find anything in Montréal that made me want more, until now.  The Mezcal is brand spanky new in town, located across the fountain on Prince Arthur.  The owner Sheila and her lovable staff all work towards the same goal, which is to provide a neighborhood vibe where you can break bread (or tortillas) with friends.  The prices are ultra affordable (not sure how she does it but god bless), the wait staff is  friendly and take pride in their little shop, so feel free to ask questions about the dishes.  This is like many a small place in Mexico, so you should expect a laid back pace where you enjoy a bite and hang out, or read a book or partake in any of the various conversation of the day.  All the food is made with great care and can range from mild to extra piccante (their sesame/peanut oïl is soooooooooogood), they have many vegetarian options and also just serve coffees.  Come on fellow yelpers letès keep this one around, I highly recommend."}
