{"text":"Begrudgingly went to the restaurant. I had passed by it a thousand times and had not dared to go into. Someone recommended it for the best burger they ever had. They were not far off. The meat was cooked to perfect medium rare and the taste of the beef was unbelievable. Service was excellent and the value was unbelievable. If you are looking for a swank place this is not for you. However if you are looking to get a great burger at an unbelievable price this is for you. The burger also comes in a one pound version that I did dare not try. The table next to us got it and it was giant. Rating based on meat taste and value. Environment would bringing it down a notch or two."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere, big portions and fair pricing, recommended for breakfast lunch and dinner, great home cooked style meals"}
{"text":"Decent cheap place to eat. Nothing fancy here, but the food is good and the staff is friendly. Definitely not the best option in Middlefield, but good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Best thing they've got going for them is the portion sizes. Good amount of food for the money, and it wasn't bad... Don't order any water, or water based beverages: as my daughter announced, \"it tastes like pennies!!\" They say don't judge a book by its cover, but in this case, you'll get exactly what you would assume you would when you look at the place: a little run down, standard small town diner fare, decent food but a good amount of it for the money."}
{"text":"Food was so good!! We came here during lunch and all got burgers and sandwiches with onion rings and fries. Dinners looked so good too!! And everything was $10 or less!! Very happy we stopped by. Too bad we aren't leaving or we'd be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Saturday with friends and we'll definitely be back! As soon as you walk in you can smell cinnamon and apples! I had the wienerschnitzel and chose the buttered noodles and green beans. They brought me mashed potatoes on accident but that was fine by me! Real potatoes yum! Whoever said the beans are out of can is wrong. If these beans are from a can then they fooled me! They were green, and tasty. I like that they did not over salt anything! Most of our table ordered prime rib which looked amazing. Two of them ordered the 24 oz and they were HUGE! Service was fast and friendly! Already planning what to order next since we were all checking out other people's plates on the way out! and BTW my iced tea tasted amazing. No penny flavor as mentioned in another review for water based beverages!"}
{"text":"First, very nice server, although she was over-seated. After I ordered I glanced around. A good number of ceiling tiles were water stained. I went to wash my hands. I've had rest stops smell better. So by this point I'm questioning the overall cleanliness when my lunch shows up. For the price it was a huge, hot roast beef sandwich and whipped potatoes smothered in gravy. Meat was very good, as were the potatoes. Gravy needed a little seasoning. If they kept one slice of bread and about half the potatoes and knocked a buck off the sandwich I'd say it was a perfect portion. I think they have an okay business and with some attention to detail, it would be even nicer."}
{"text":"I don't think I ever need to go back. Actually I never got a chance to be seated or eat. Me son and I walked into the restaurant and waited 10+ minutes in what we thought was the check in line. A nice man paying in front of us told me, if you want to be seated, go stand over there ( next to a pie case). There is no sign noting this whatsoever. So I move to the pie case and wait again.  Staff members continue to walk past us, each avoiding eye contact. Then the lady who was checking out several guests at the register, finally acknowledged us and said, \" if your want to eat, it will be another 15 min.\"  I was furious. Now I'm here 20 minutes or more and they want me to wait another 15 for what appeared to be super mediocre food. No way. I left. The least the cashier/ hostess could have done is let me know that ahead of time. Instead, they wanted to pretend I wasn't there!"}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me!  The place was filthy dirty!!!  Nothing Amish about it. Can't figure out the 4 star rating. So gross and sadly run down!"}
{"text":"My family and I headed down to Middlefield to check out a class for my little boy and decided to stop for dinner. Boy are we glad that we did!  Hubby got the prime rib, I got the sirloin and my little chicken got a cheeseburger. Let me first start by saying that the 16 oz prime rib is more like a side of beef. it is about 1 1/2\" thick and comes WITH the bone. In addition to the meat, you get sides and a salad or soup. It was more than enough food for two people. I got a 12 oz sirloin cooked to perfection with two sides and a salad. No need for steak sauce. Thats how you know its a good steak! The cheeseburger was totally juicy. My 3 year old devoured half of it because it was huge.   You really get what you pay for here. The service is also excellent. Our waitress saw our 1 year old getting squirmy so she took her for us (yes you heard right) and walked around the restaurant with her so mom and dad could finish our dinner. Seriously, where else does that happen? The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so she took her to see the pies spinning in the pie case. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast after church or just out for a bite. Good prices, food was great every time. Service is always good. Much better now that sleazy Twisters is gone."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp! for my husband one morning.  He drives a Taxi service for the Amish and was on a break and looking for a good breakfast. He called me back quickly to tell me it was the best omelette he had ever had.  So while we were in Middlefield last weekend he treated me to a date night dinner there. It was so good! First off let me say our waiter, Robi was a hoot.  He had my husband in hysterics - especially when he compared being the only male waiter to being a brother in a house full of bratty sisters. He had our drinks and rolls out to us in no time and took our order.  My husband had a Steak smothered in ale soaked onions with a loaded baked potato, green beans and a side salad,  I had a Sirloin steak with green beans and loaded potato and French Onion Soup.  I normally would not have ordered steak at a place like this but after reading such great reviews of the prime rib and other plates and the aromas that were wafting though the building I felt I would be OK.  And I was right!  The French Onion Soup was as good as any of the local chain steak houses.  I would however ask them to leave off the chives next time as I found them way too many and unnecessary.  The steak was cooked rare as I asked and really good.  i would have liked it to be more seasoned but it was definitely a good choice.  I loved both my sides and cleaned my plate. My husband also enjoyed his meal and cannot wait for the next time!  We shared a piece of Chocolate mouse pie for dessert and I think I got 4 bites! My non sweet eating husband said it was one of the best he head had in years. I thought the pie filling itself was great but did not like the crust as it was very soggy. All in all a 4 star meal!  Look forward to trying this again!"}
{"text":"The Dutch Country Restaurant is a great place for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Simple & rustic restaurant that definitely did dazzle our tastebuds by way of down-home cooking goodness.....  As you enjoy a ride through the country on the rural rolling hills, you will definitely have to stop into The New Dutch Country Restaurant located on Kinsman Road (RT 87) just east of Burton but west of Middlefield, Ohio.  The areas' back-setting is so beautiful.  There is plenty of parking.  The building & interior are well kempt; it's just a casual cracker-barrel throwback.  It would easily accommodate large groups, families, friends, or couples seeking great home-style cookin'!!  Dinner rolls were made fresh & served with cinnamon butter, which was amazingly sweet & understated.  Their French Onion Soup was served in the apropos mini crock; the broth was full of flavor with a fine balance of ingredients - croutons, mozzarella, & onions.  We tried the Weinerschnitzel based on recommendations from other Yelpers; it was breaded & cooked to an appetizing perfection, then graciously served with three (3) sides.  We chose the Pasta Salad, which was a small splendor in itself.  We also chose their heavily touted real Mashed Potatoes, gravy, & rounded off with the Homemade Stuffing that I believe is baked.  This self-selected platter could have been great with any combination of sides, but for my preferences, this was a throwback to a family-style country sit-down dinner.  The renowned burgers were fresh, large, seasoned & tasty, as a suggestion:  1/4 lb. option would compliment well with the available 1/2 lb. & 1 pound offerings.  The cucumber sauce on the \"Garrett Burger\" had a creamy Italian zing to it.  The children's portion were huge, leaving plenty of leftovers for when the kids settle down & get the munchies.  I would guess the children's Cheeseburger was about 1/4 lb. served with fresh-cut fries.  The kids' Spaghetti with Meatball had flair.  I might have these homemade pie titles wrong, \"yummier\" & \"yummiest\" are the fitting descriptors in our humble opinions (AKA:  Apple Crumb Pie - better than most & Oreo Cream Pie - winner by a 3 to 4 vote of surpassing even the most delicious Apple Crumb).  We were seated immediately.  Scarlett was smiling & joyful, just an excellent server.  She kept our drinks refreshed.  Note:  there is no Sunday liquor sales, but The New Dutch Country Restaurant had a decent selection of bottled beers, several that you don't see too often.  Scarlett made sure our orders were right, food was served quickly, presentation of the food was on point, & all special requests fulfilled.    We mention this sincerely; Scarlett was that rare server that enhances your whole dining experience with her energy & attitude (Perfect 10 on her follow through & rotation).  Affordability is remarkable for a family of four (4) with several extras, including desserts, plus a generous gratuity, we escaped for about $55 - inexplicably unbeatable quality for that price.  We literally told each other that we needed to move out here for the outdoor recreation, sights & views, as well as to wear out our welcome at The New Dutch Country Restaurant - we want to adventure through their whole menu!!!"}
{"text":"Pastrami Swiss cheese melt on rye - good simple and safe with mustard - enjoyed the fries too - with catsup - kind of run down building needs a little make over - closed business next door gives that folded business city feel even in the middle of no where - middlefield, ohio"}
{"text":"The prime rib was amazing - the best thing on the menu. I had a side of potatoes and green beans unfortunately I was completely stuffed after my 17 oz steak.   That's right, the 17 oz was huge and enough to fill me up. This is coming from the guy who smashes Taco Bell party boxes \"12 soft tacos\" like its no ones business.  If your in middlefield - this is the one place you have to stop for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Great home cooking at dirt cheap prices, chicken breast, fries, slaw, and a water for 10 out the door....can't beat that and chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Breakfast are best. Omelet are filled exactly how it should be.potatoes are actually cooked and seasoned. Coffee is plentiful.waotress have been their for ever and treat you like friends."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, you need to. Good comfort food at great prices. I had a burger, which was outstanding, and a great value at $5.50. The chili chz fries were a big hit, portion has huge and very tasty. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Didn't even know about this place until my mom and i drove by it. We decided to try something new so we ate here. We enjoyed it. We both got burgers and they were delicious!! And our waitress was super friendly and sweet. I will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"We came in just in time for Breakfest! They took care of us, drinks came right out with such a friendly server! Well I can honestly say that all five of us had a very good Breakfest. Excellent value and good portion sizes. The home fries were some of the best I have had. I would suggest updating decor for better ambiance, all and all I would recommend and would be back!!!"}
{"text":"Being able to drink alcohol now, they make a lovely strawberry daiquiri! And now that Twister's is gone, no more obnoxious bar patrons!"}
{"text":"We had read reviews about this place and had to check it out. We were seated in minutes and our waitress (Savannah) didn't miss a beat. She was very sweet and very attentive. We ordered the French Onion soup and it was great. Within about 5 mins, our prime rib arrived. I had a 12oz and my husband a 16oz. The cuts if meat were MASSIVE! So delicious too! We both took half of the meal home. We paid less than $20 for each meal. We will definitely be back when visiting the area!"}
{"text":"If adjusted for a cheap eats home cooking type place, then 5 stars; but if you want fine dining, this is not the place. We are not local (Detroit) and were just looking for a quick meal. This place surpassed our expectations.   Service: we had limited time and told our server.  Boy, did she hustle. We never felt rushed, but never once had to wait for anything. Food came in order and quickly, timed better than a fine dining establishment.  Kitchen accommodated her timing.   Price/Portions: this place is beyond reasonable; its flat out cheap. Very cheap. Portions are very big.  Big portions, plus cheap prices, often concerns me re: quality. They do cut corners, but not on the important stuff.   Food: Good.  Very good for cheap eats. Chili just great.  Soup home-made; bit bland, but tasty. Dinner salads - pre-portioned lettuce on plate with thick dressing in a pre-portioned cup. Skip that.  Pasta - daughter liked huge portion of spaghetti. Runny thin sauce, but has 3 home made big meatballs.  Lots of breading, but tasty. Despite appearances, it was good. Clearly home made sauce - they need lessons on making a thick marinara.  Wiener schnitzel -  breading way too thick, but this is pretty close, for this type of place. Good mashed, but green beans clearly canned and gross.  Prime rib - cooked to order, so I've never had it this way. Obviously roasted earlier, then brought up to temperature. My medium rare, was in fact, and shockingly for an end piece, just a bit above medium rare. I got the bone, and it was a bit fatty, but the burnt outer skin was simply delicious. 15 oz portion was more like 25+ oz.   Loaded baked potato - pre-cooked and dried out.   Corn was canned, but I like canned cord, so guilty pleasure here.  Son ordered chili cheddar fries. Menu says it's a huge plate, but this is a massively huge plate. Plus cheap.  Chili is good (supra), cheese is always good, and the fries are obviously hand cut on site, so taste like that.  I happen not to like fresh hand cut fries, but if you do, they have them. Processed brine soaked fries always taste better and get crispier.  But unhealthy.   Coconut cream pie: before you ask, only my 9 year old daughter finished her huge pasta plate. We put at least 50% of everything else into cooler in car to take home. Then 4 of us split just 1 piece. Clearly homemade. Crust is perfect for a cream pie. Filling - cut corner here; too much whipped cream mixed in. It's more like a dense coconut flavored whipped cream pie.    I will be in Middlefield from Detroit next year. I will go there again. Anxiously."}
{"text":"This place is not deserving of all the bells and whistles I was hearing about food was ok at best and service needs to get better everything about this place evokes small town America sorry America this sucks"}
{"text":"Truly a pleasant surprise, a hidden gem, and one of our family's favorite!   The menu is as plain Americana as you can find - hot sandwiches, steaks, meatloaf, chicken with dumplings, and pies.  The true beauty is how delicious it all is - made from wholesome ingredients!  Even the meatloaf, which one would expect to be the most boring menu item, is sumptuously moist and full of flavor.  Our favorite is the 24-oz prime rib.  Slow roasted and seasoned perfectly - quite a delicious cut of beef which tastes far better than the big chain steakhouses.  Comes with choice of potato and vegetable.  All for $19.99!  Can't beat that and leftovers galore!  UPDATE (5/24/14):  Had to drop from my 5-star review back in 2010 (above) as the quality has somewhat waned in recent years.  Quality isn't terrible but just doesn't seem to wow us as it used to.  We still dine here every now and then although nowhere near as frequently because of it."}
{"text":"My family, a hungry group of cyclists, pulled into this restaurant and ordered all the potatoes and meat we could handle and came away satisfied.  My meatloaf and mashed potatoes was particularly delicious.  I will say that the green beans definitely came out of the can but I'm still a fan. This is exactly what you want from a down home restaurant."}
{"text":"I stopped here while out for a drive in the country. I was nervous that the food would be of poor quality because the inside of the restaurant is very unappealing.  It is very dark inside, looks like the place could use a good dusting, overall cleaning and for God's sake some art or something bright inside.  I ordered the special of the day, Ham and mac n cheese and it was delicious!  I was surprised at the quality of both the thick sliced ham and the mac n cheese.  The green beans were canned, the roll was so/so, the side salad came with a packet of dressing (TACKY!) but darn that ham and mac n cheese was great. It was hot, cooked well, of good quality and there seemed to be enough for three meals.   I thought the service was pretty good.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you enjoy simple home cooked meals. This is your place. If you cant find something on the menu you like . You cant be pleased period. My meal ham and cabbage over egg noodles with one side and a warm bun and butter for $5.99. I also had a bowl of French onion soup which was $4.50 actually I would put it up there in the top five French onion soup I've ever had service was great the atmosphere is homey if you're a truck driver like I am you could get a tractor trailer in here or bobtailing would be easier . I could not even finish my meal I only ate half"}
{"text":"I like this place, eat here often, could be exceptional with a little update on the decor, but still pretty good food especially for the price, the waitresses are always friendly and pretty good, I like the turkey and dressing, it's one of my favorites, my wife gets the liver and it's good, I don't buy it out anywhere cause mines better, lol, overall a good dining experience, better than Mary Yoders"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff!  The prices are very reasonable. We will be back, next time we're in Amish country!  I recommend the wiener schnitzel and my girlfriend loved the chicken"}
{"text":"This place is nothing to look at from the outside or the inside. The menu is extensive and the prices are quite reasonable. We enjoyed the tasty meal and entertaining server. The mashed potatoes are HOMEMADE. If you like American comfort food this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Roast beef was sliced deli roast beef. Nothing homemade about it. Meat loaf was smooth, like all the ingredients were placed in a blender and then formed.  Decor was OK, a little dark. The food was lacking.  I would not recommend this place, especially after driving 45 minutes"}
{"text":"simple country dining... Amazing prices and food.  Great service. We were in town visiting for the county fair. If they have the 1/2 chicken diner, it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 recently.  Goood service and food.  Prime rib was top shelf !  Pork chops a bit tough.    1 Lb burger for 7.95 was great !!"}
