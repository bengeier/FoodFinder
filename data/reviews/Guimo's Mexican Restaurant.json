{"text":"You walk in, order and get seated. The food comes out really quickly, I typically go here on my lunch around 12 and am able to eat and leave by 12:30 and I'm still able to take my time. The food is very authentic and delicious, the best Mexican restaurant in sun prairie that I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Food had to ordered and paid for at counter. Cashier did not speak English. Food was eventually brought to table, Luke warm. And missing extras we ordered and paid for. Tortillas were soggy with grease."}
{"text":"1. Food selection was straightforward - good menu.  2. Great execution of taco lengua and pambazo.  3. House-made salsa tastes fresh and has a little spice - safe for most pallets I think. (I could use more heat) 4. Good portion for price.  5. Friendly family business with good service.   Will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Started by 3 local guys who were chefs for Market Street Diner and Buck & Honey's. Super cool they had the guts and the resources to strike out on their own. Very impressive. They should be very proud of what they've done. If you like authentic Mexican food, make sure you visit Guimo's in downtown Sun Prairie. I promise...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a restaurant like this since we left Texas.  Great food all three meals that we've had.  We'll be regulars here!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and this is my new go-to place!! Very consistent (been there 4 times now), authentic, flavorful, & fresh ingredients!! Attentive service, also."}
{"text":"We ate here this week and the food is awesome!  The portions are generous and the prices are great!  The burritos and enchiladas are top notch. This is our new favorite Mexican restaurant.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Have been twice now. First time I had a pambazo, second time I had pozole. This is the real deal. Three kinds of agua fresca were offered each visit as well. Excellent service, and actually convenient to get to from the east side of Madison, worth the drive."}
{"text":"I had the enchilada suiza and it was very good.  Lots of chicken in it. Big portion. It could have used a little more spice. Overall, I would go back and I would order this again.  Cannot wait to try the other things."}
{"text":"We tried Guimo's for the first time last Sunday. We were very pleased. I had a chicken and shrimp quesadilla and it was very flavorful. Teenage daughter had enchiladas and finished them quickly with no complaining or snarky editorial comment, which tells me they must have been good. Dining room is clean but not much flair, the highlight here is clearly the freshly prepared food, not the ambiance. I will say that the hostess and server were super-friendly, and seemed to really enjoy making sure their customers were happy. I look forward to going back and trying the Carnitas special and some tacos in the future."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Gave it a few tries & didn't find it appetizing. Food is prepared sloppy, tasteless, & low quality. If go back again I'd only get the tacos... plain & no cheese"}
{"text":"Have ordered twice for carryout and couldn't ask for more! I've tried chicken, pork, and steak tacos and they've been amazing. White onion and cilantro on top, simple and perfect. They include small containers of red and green salsa and they added a little spice. Can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try a new spot. We have had much better Mexican food most of the time. Bothe the rice & the beans were very mediocre. he enchilada were very flavorless and the Alhambra was over cooked and salty. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This new Sun Prairie offering has authentic, Mexican food-freshly made and extremely flavorful. Since they are open from 9 am to 9 pm, my husband and I went there for breakfast today. I had Huevos Mexicano (eggs w/ vegetables, rice and beans along with corn or flour tortillas) It was a huge portion, but so tasty, I finished it all. My husband had Huevos con Chorizo and a sangria soda. They have an extensive, reasonably priced menu, including lunch specials and weekday and weekend selections (like Menudos). You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table. They also have a huge choice of beverages from Horchata to sodas (with real sugar) to several juices. The decor is bright, festive and the restaurant is very clean. We were checked on  at least three times during our meal, to make sure everything was  all right,  that our drinks were full, and that we had enough tortillas. There is a large TV on the wall which was tuned to music videos. The homemade salsas/sauces  for the table were fresh, flavorful, one red and one green with a wonderful touch of heat which was there and then was gone.  The owners and staff are very friendly. The restaurant is almost outside or backyard, so we will be back many times, especially take out."}
{"text":"This was hands down, the best Mexican food I have had in a very long time.  We had Chile Rellenos, combination fajitas, enchiladas, tamales, tacos and rice and beans.  It was authentic and tasted like my mother-in-law's food, who is from Texas by the border.  This was better than any other restaurant in Madison or the surrounding areas."}
{"text":"Had the chicken nachos and yum! Giant plate that is easily shareable. Nice little place with fair prices and friendly atmosphere.  They also have Mac n cheese on the kids menu which is a must for my daughter."}
{"text":"Brand new place in Sun Prairie, so I'll give them a little leeway on the service.   First, you order at the counter from a chalkboard menu which has a great variety of authentic Mexican food to choose from. I chose the steak burrito and a pork taco. They are still working to perfect taking orders and we're a little slow, but I'm sure they'll figure it out. They also had some trouble with the chip reader for my credit card which slowed things down a little.   They gave me a number to take to my table but I didn't have to wait more than about 5 minutes for them to bring my food. They also checked on us once about half way through the meal.   Both the burrito and the taco were very good, especially with the addition of the either green or red salsa, which was in squeeze bottles at the table.   My son got the chorizo burrito and said he really liked it. The only confusion was that they didn't tell us which was which, so we had to cut into them to find out. Really no big deal.   Overall, we were happy with our experience and will be back."}
{"text":"We love Guimo's! The food is great, the service is fast and the staff is very kind. My son & I eat there once a week, to watch for fire trucks (it's across from the fire station.) We order a variety of tacos & occasionally other items. Everything we get is flavorful- the meat is juicy, not dry. The beans and rice are tasty. While we love the other taqueria nearby as well, we love being able to sit down in the restaurant to eat. The staff will check on us regularly & they are all so sweet to my little boy. Prices are completely fair ($1.50/taco).   If you haven't been here yet- try it!"}
{"text":"Was there for supper this evening.  Great employees, great food!  I had Fajitas Supreme, which consisted of steak, shrimp, and chicken.  The food was plentiful and the steak and shrimp was really good!"}
{"text":"We came here for a quick dinner to pick up and take home. The gal that took our order at the register was very friendly and helped us make a decision with her recommendations. I ordered a trio of tacos of steak, pork & chicken and I don't know which one was my favorite! They were all so good! Everything was fresh and had great flavor. I highly recommend ordering pico de gallo to add to the tacos."}
{"text":"YES!! FINALLY a good, authentic Mexican restaurant in the largest Madison suburb!!! I've been twice, and had enchiladas each time. Mole sauce is quite good. Chicken & carnitas are tasty & tender. My wife loves the suiza sauce (tomatillo), and the kids eat every bit of their quesadillas. Food is fresh, & the employees are really very friendly & accommodating. This place is a much-needed addition to our town. The only thing I missed was a cold beer, but they said their liquor license is on its way."}
{"text":"We are really excited to have another promising new restaurant in Sun Prairie. The menu at Guimo's looks incredible, boasting a long list of authentic Mexican dishes, plenty of which are not offered at competitor restaurants in Sun Prairie, or even Madison.  Their menu states that they servr breakfast Monday-Friday and I am dying to try it. I hope in the future they consider extending breakfast to the weekends too, especially since they are located across from the Sun Prairie farmer's market on Saturday.   I ordered the Mojarra Frita, which, despite its intimidating appearance, is incredibly delicious. It is a whole fried white fish with sauce, and is unbelievably tender. All of the flavors go really well together, and they have a tomatillo salsa that is insanely delicious.   Sadly, I have seen many great restaurants fail in Sun Prairie. Guimo's seems like a fantastic restaurant, and I hope they succeed because there are countless more things I want to try on their menu. Truly a gem with well-cooked, unique foods."}
{"text":"We stopped in on two occasions and were not impressed with the quality of food. We tried nachos, quesadillas, alambre and a burrito throughout the two trips. The meat was not very appetizing and the overall taste just wasn't there. The staff was friendly and inviting and service was great. Chips and salsa was probably the only thing we enjoyed."}
{"text":"We both had the enchiladas and they were tasty.  I had the Enchiladas Suizas and my partner had the Enchiladas verdes.  We also had the guacamole which was very good.  On the down side - the chips with the guacamole were some horrible food colored red and green combined with normal chips - just not a good feel.  The rice and beans that came with the meal were sort of meh.  Why can't anyone spice up their rice and beans with some fresh cilantro, onions, or black beans.  Overall I would go back, but I would skip the rice and beans next time."}
{"text":"After I finished my plate, found a hair.  Food was average but price was good.  If a hair wasn't found I would have given it 3 stars."}
{"text":"A great local Mexican restaurant. The prices were fair and the food was great. All the workers were extremely friendly. Definitely will return to try additional items!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!! Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! I had their mexican burrito and it had amazing flavor! Not greasy at all! We had a pitcher of margaritas that was super delicious... service was a bit slow but good. They had this jalapeno green sauce that needs to be bottled and sold. I need to put it on everything."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese enchiladas and a quesadilla. Quesadilla never came, enchiladas had to be remade 3 times because it kept on coming out wrong. The cheese inside the enchiladas seemed like melted string cheese..also ordered no beans but all 3 came with beans. Once they finally got the enchiladas right, they were okay. My moms order was cold and mushy. However, my dads tilapia was great. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's filled a much needed hole  left since La Tolteca was forced out last year by Salvatorys."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had in my life and I'm not crazy for the food usually. I had 3 pork tacos and it was amazing! Very full of flavor and the portions were bigger than j expected. I highly recommend this place to everyone. I won't go anywhere else for tacos except here"}
{"text":"Sometimes folks get real excited when a new restaurant opens up, especially in a smaller city like Sun Prairie. From this, I believe, people tend to give overly enthusiastic reviews. I say this gently because what I'm about to say is going to land on the side of unpopular opinion.   When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly young lady, and we decided to try a steak burrito and a vegetarian one.   Every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, and that has been a lot, has always served chips and salsa while one waits for their meal. This was not the case here. I don't know if that was standard operating procedure here, or perhaps something that they just don't do at lunch time.   Regardless, our burritos came out pretty fast and they looked great. After getting about half way through them, we looked at each other kind of puzzled and said \"this is pretty bland.\" I've come to accept that sometimes vegetarian food can be served quite bland at restaurants, but this was like baby food bland. Lettuce, rice, onions, tomatoes, and refried beans. Where was the garlic, cilantro, cumin, even salt??? My dining companion's steak burrito was similar, only with burned little chunks of steak.   We acquired a bottle of Cholula sauce from the cabinet in the dining room and that's how we seasoned these burritos. You shouldn't have to go to a Mexican restaurant and use half a bottle of sauce to gain any semblance of flavor in your food.   I know this place is new, and I want them to succeed, especially as a locally-owned family business, but the burritos were disasters wrapped in a tortilla, and I can do that at home."}
{"text":"I was craving authentic Mexican food and found this place on Yelp. There aren't many good Mexican restaurants in suburban: Sun Prairie, WI. This place is fairly new, clean, and well maintained. We ordered 4 tacos (2 beef and 2 pork), a beef tongue dish with rice and beans, and menudo to go. The tacos were amazingly delicious! You can tell the meats were not store bought and frozen but freshly killed by the taste and quality. The food was extremely fresh and well prepared and not too salty or bland--perfectly seasoned. We will definitely go again the next time we are craving authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at Guimos at the last minute as we were stuck in traffic on Bristol St. What an excellent surprise! We thought we have eaten good Mexican food before but we've never had anything quite as good as this. The food was wonderful,spicy, and hot. I had the fajita pastor and my wife had a chicken quesadilla. Both were very good and the portions were just the right size. The restaurant is in an old strip mall just off of the Main Street. The ambiance is what you would expect for a strip mall, but the friendly staff and superb food make you forget about all of that.  I highly recommend this place if you love Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time try this place and we very like it, food tasty and feel like we are eating real Mexican food! Recommend"}
{"text":"Had the enchiladas mole plate They were good and the mole sauce was very good, tasty. The rest of the offerings, the \"red\" colored rice and the runny beans kinda sucked in comparison. Rice and beans were bland. Side sauces were very good as was the service. Will be back to try the tacos. They looked good at another table. Would it hurt to offer some decent rice and beans?"}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is an authentic Mexican restaurant near me.  For dinners, it isn't quite the scale of what I had before moving back to Dane county, but what they do is very good.  I've been here a few times now and it has quickly become my default for great tacos.  Though, not for boring things like steak and chicken.  You really need to get into the pork or the beef tongue.  The tripe was good too, but not in comparison.  I really want to try some other items, but I'm too obsessed with tacos (TACOS!) to do that.  I did have a burrito once, but it was quickly overshadowed by a plate of tacos.  I hope they keep at it.  I will be coming here for many more tacos."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the greater Madison area.  Food is fresh and delicious.  I had steak torta and wife had pork and steak tacos.  Even the chips and salsa were excellent.  Staff very pleasant and restaurant immaculate and bright.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on Monday to try it out. I was sceptical because Sun Prairie has a couple of Mexican restaurants and most are pretty bad. They have a small menu with the basic items you would find at any Mexican restaurant. Their lunch menu was very inexpensive, most items were $5.99. We tried the enchilada verdes and chile rellenos. Both were amazing.   The enchilada verdes had great flavor and all the ingredients were very fresh. It had a little bit of spice with a great back end tartness. The Chile rellenos were big and very flavorful. Service was good but they were not busy at the time we went. We got there about 1:00pm.  We enjoyed the meal so much we went back for dinner on Tuesday night. The place was busier and had many families with small children. It made sense because they have a kids menu that was very inexpensive. We ordered the nachos grande, enchiladas verde (again because it was so good) and the enchiladas creamy tomatillos. The nachos were huge and had the perfect balance of chips and toppings. Both enchilada dishes were perfect.  The big selling point for us is they use fresh ingredients. The chicken was firm, juicy and shredded. On the nachos the chicken had great seasoning and crisped up by the grill. Their refried beans are the best we have had. They are not pasty or heavy at all. The rice was fresh and flavorful. I recommend Guimo's to all that love mexican food."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. Staff are prompt and professional. It is absolutely spotless clean and very simple. I must have ordered the wrong thing. I had the steak tacos. Portions were large. The steak was gristly and trying to cut it to place in tortilla was challenging as was chewing it. Beans weee good. Rice was fairly bland. Didn't really enjoy either sauce. I'll try again and order something else as others seemed pleased with their food."}
{"text":"The Pambazo Papas con Chorizo sandwich is fantastic! Their authentic sauces are great as well!"}
{"text":"I have lots of check ins here and 90% of the photos on yelp are posted by me. So the place has to be amazing if I went through all these trouble. I have to say we basically ate out of here everyday when we first discovered it. It's like if I ever have a Hispanic grandma she would be cooking food like this place does.  What makes their food so delicious is as follows:  The meat are real meat with white and dark pieces, full of flavors and grilled perfectly. The frying skill is superb too. There is a fish dish on the menu, the fish is just plain old fish, but the frying makes it crispy and yummy. All the tacos are delicious, you can't go wrong with them. the torta are huge, the house nacho is amazing, all the fajitas are perfectly grilled.  The place is more or less self serve, you order first at the counter, then the employees will bring the food to you. There are carryout boxes and sauces for self serve. Employees will bring out 2 types of salsa. One doesn't have to tip the employees but it's nice to leave some at the time of payment.  What's refreshing is the variety of meat, other part of cow or pig that they offer. It's also refreshing see some traditional dishes offered on weekends. Too bad the breakfasts are weekday only and I haven't got the chance to try.  This place is not for those who just like chain restaurants' perfect white chicken cubes, or have to have free chips. Alot of those places taste good too but one can also appreciate the variety of flavors and dishes Guimos offers."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. This place was authentic, delicious and comfortable to eat at. The menu was full of dishes above the usual taco and burritto fare. I ordered the chicken milanesa and whole fried tilapia. The portions were very large. This fed two adults and two toddlers. The tilapia was fresh and expertly fried. The salad that came with it had a great jalepeno and cheese topping. The french fries were the best I've had since we moved here. The chicken milanesa was three good size cutlets pounded thin. The rice and beans were delicately seasoned. The dining room atmosphere and chairs were comfortable. There was a tv silently playing Spanish news. There was a mix of families, couples, and people getting take out. The servers were kind and you could tell it was run by family.  We will be back every time we are in the mood for mexican food!"}
{"text":"New to Madison coming from Southern California so that means on a mission for Mexican food. Being hopeful, but it's hard to live up to SoCal Mexican food. This was the first Mexican restaurant we tried.   Food: Ordered the loaded nachos. In CA, we have carne asada chips and carne asada fries which is my go-to order. This dish was the closest. I love nacho cheese so of course ordered this. Ordered the beef not knowing if it was carne asada, ground beef or shredded beef...lol. At least that's the options in CA. Haha. It was carne asada. Came out looking so pretty. We never have olives in Mexican food! Odd. But luckily I like olives.  I have to say the nachos tasted really good. More Americanized if you will. The carne asada was a different cut of beef. A little more fat which my husband cannot stand. Slightly different taste but still tasty.  Husband ordered the asada burrito. Not used to having rice and beans in a burrito. But he liked it as well. Again picking out the fatty parts.  We also ordered 1 taco. Can't recall if it was adobada or pastor. Pretty much almost the same. It's pork. Definitely tasted different than CA. But it was yummy.   Service: So you order at a counter and girl brings out your food and drinks. Water for everyone. We didn't know this. So didn't order a fountain beverage because we didn't know they had one and ordered a small bottled soda! And hubby drinks a lot. Now I know they do. She was sweet and attentive.   Parking/location: In a small area in a neighborhood. (or maybe it's just different to us) Plenty of parking.  Verdict: Will try out something new here again."}
{"text":"We discovered this gem in Sun Prairie about three months ago. From the welcoming as we walked in, to the Thank You's and well wishes given us on our way out, our experience has always been wonderful. The food is great. The prices are very affordable. The staff is very helpful while we are ordering. You order at the counter when you walk in and they bring it to your table. They definitely have regulars with us!"}
{"text":"I went this past Saturday and got Guimo's Torta....This is the ultimate hangover food! It is huge, easily the biggest sandwich I've ever seen. Also, it's delicious with fried chicken, hot dogs, beans, avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, eggs, onions, and probably ten other things that I'm forgetting. They also included a red sauce and a green sauce, both very different and very tasty. I will be back soon to try the fried tacos as I saw another table with them and had they gone to the restroom I would have snuck a bite. Hit this place up!"}
