{"text":"DO NOT GO. This place is horrendous - the people are horrible and the lighting is horrible. The crowd is even worse, most people look like they haven't looked in a mirror in years. It's a casual bar until about 11pm, then for some reason unbeknown to anyone its a karaoke bar/dance club. There is barely a dance floor! ( I hope that explains the level of drunkenness that occurs here). Only good things - darts. Oh and parking is horrible, beware a drunk person doesn't hit your car."}
{"text":"Great local bar with 20 beers on tap. Great selection of food! Good place to watch games too!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go for a sports game. Their specials are pretty good price-wise. There is smoking inside which can be sort of gross but most people go outside on the patio. During the warm months there is cornhole outside to play! There is also a small dance floor, but I have only seen a couple groups dance. I haven't eaten there so I can't really rate the food. It's not my first choice to go back because of the atmosphere, but it is an ok place."}
{"text":"Went here on Wing Night with a large group of friends. Wings are great! There are over 50 different flavors to chose from and the wings themselves were very crispy and juicy. I went with the Garlic Thai and the Yukon Gold. For their Wing special on Wednesday nights wings are only .48 cents each but you have to order at least 8 of a favor, so if you want to try two different flavors you have to order at least 16. Not a problem for me and my friends, but 8 seemed like an odd number. Would rather have had the number be 5 or 6 and I could have tried another different flavor or two.  They have appetizer and drink specials from 5-7. Parking is a bit tight in their lot, so be wary. Smoke free in the bar/restaurant area, but there are two patios that have cover and heaters. Plenty of TVs around the entire place. Pool tables and a few video machines.  Met the owner and he was really nice. I've heard good things about their brisket sandwich, so I look forward to going back to try it.  Hope to be back for another Wing night in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for Tuesday night trivia with a group of friends. We had no problem getting a seat for the 6 of us and just in time for the start of round 1 of questions. Waitress came over right away and asked us for our drink and food order so she didn't distract us from the trivia questions being asked. The garlic ranch wings were pretty good, had a nice crunch to them, and their burger was a good size and flavor. Their desserts are what we really enjoyed! We got the Party Cookie and Smores Flatbread and they did not disappoint. Out of the oven and right to our table so it was still warm, not overly sweet, and portions worth the $7. Fun place to hang out, play pool, watch a game, eat, and compete in trivia!"}
{"text":"Shenanigans is a decent local watering hole. Nothing too spectacular, nothing to complain about either. The food menu here is decent and the drinks are reasonably priced.   There are big screen TV's so you can catch the game here and two pool tables.  It gets a little busy here so sometimes you might be better off heading to the bar to get drinks instead of waiting for the waitresses to come around.  You can smoke inside here so dont wear your nice clothes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite suburb bars in pittsburgh.  Great drink choices and specials.  Wings are a must get on Wednesdays.  Great place to watch hockey."}
{"text":"Sometimes people give this place a bad rap.  I mean, it's a neighborhood bar, so it's what I'd expect going in.  As with any local establishment, the regulars get preferential treatment.  It happens, get over it.  Late night and on the weekends it can get crowded.  And yes, they do allow smoking which is the main reason one star is deducted.   Shenanigans has a full bar and numerous beers on tap.  They have great daily food specials.  I've tried several menu items and it's always been good and what I would consider above average for bar food.  Good burgers, good pizza.  Surprisingly good quesadilla.  Tons of wing flavors.  And you can't really mess up fries when you pile cheese and bacon on top.  The service can be slow.  But they are usually pretty busy and as long as my waitress or bartender keeps liquid in my glass, I don't mind waiting for food."}
{"text":"I used to come here, then it turned into a smoke-filled place that got a waiver to keep it's smoking status when everywhere else went non-smoking.  It was terrible and I've stayed away for years.  But, I heard that it's under new management and is now non-smoking so I decided to give it another try. When I walked in there is no smoke residue.  It's clean and nice.  They have a nice patio outside with corn hole, as well as pool tables inside. The menu is typical bar food, but it's good.  I've had the pulled pork and the wings and both were good.  It's a great place to kick back and relax with some food.  I've even come at an off-hour (eg, Saturday mid-afternoon) with my kids and let them play corn hole while we are waiting for food.  They have a decent kids' menu.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ahh, where to start.  Shenanigans is your friendly neighborhood bar... but with a trillion different kinds of beer.  Okay, maybe not a trillion, but enough to line an entire side of the bar (look up!).  All the mass market stuff is available, plus some local-ish stuff from Ohio (Thirsty Dog, I think?).  Prices are good (especially by California standards) and bartenders are attentive.  Darts are available in the back on the left.  Crowd hanging around outside gets a bit rowdy after last call... the sound of bottles breaking in the parking lot does not inspire confidence.  Fun all the same, though."}
{"text":"Unless you are getting pizza, cheese fries or mozzarella sticks, the food here is really awful. We come here to play darts and order pizza. For that, it is great. It is also a popular spot for Penguins games, which are probably the only times I've ever seen it actually busy. They have a fun trivia night on Tuesdays also which we've enjoyed on several occasions."}
{"text":"I don't rewrite reviews.  I try a lot of places once due to how much I travel, and I am really adamant that you have one chance to impress me.  My first experience here a few months ago was lackluster, and I wrote it off.  Brad, I'm assuming the owner or GM, contacted me to come back and give them a 2nd chance.  He was very professional, and I couldn't help but give a local bar another try.  So my friend from my first trip and I returned and were pleasantly surprised.  Our server, Danielle, was sweet and a great server.  She was super outgoing and friendly, and she was that way with all of her tables.  She was running around to keep up, but she did a great job.  Kudos to her.  We started out with two dirty girls scout shots ($5/shot).  The alcohol content was generous, and it makes me really happy when bartenders make the shot green.  Danielle also came over to confirm the bartender could make it, which was cool.  We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($7.50) and Bavarian Pretzel Hangover Sandwich ($7.25).  The Buffalo Chicken Dip was delicious and served with chips and pita.  The pita was an awesome idea, and it went really well with the dip.  The portion on the buffalo chicken dip was pretty small.  I would definitely order it during Happy Hour when it's half price, but there are larger portions on other appetizers.  I just love eating, though.  The Bavarian Pretzel Sandwich was egg, cheese, and bacon on a pretzel bun.  At $7.25, I'd come back for this.  The egg to cheese to bacon ration was great, and pretzel buns are always fun!  The sandwich was pretty big too.  We split it, and had I eaten the whole thing myself I would have been full.  The sandwich options here were cool, and I'm looking forward to trying some more.  Shenanigans has different nightly specials from BOGO pizza to cheap burgers and $.40 wing nights.  There were cheap beers different nights and other specials as well depending on the day of the week.  They have Happy Hour from 3-7 on weeknights which includes 1/2 price appetizers and something with Absolute for $3.  I think Happy Hour here is going to need to happen soon in my life.  There are also themed nights like trivia and I think karaoke.  Shenanigans is price wise comparable to Applebee's, but with better quality and locally owned.  Next time you are looking for a late night snack and drink, come here.  Things I Still Don't Love: -They allow smoking.  While I haven't been over powered by smoke here yet, you do smell like an ash tray on the way out.  I'm voting Shenanigans leads Pittsburgh to banning smoking in bars.  Let people smoke outside.  -The parking lot is scary.  I'm not sure they can fix it, but people here park crazyyyy.  There aren't a lot of spots, and the lot is TIGHT.  If you can carpool with your group, do it.  Overall, I'm really glad Brad got in touch with me, and I am looking forward to returning to Shenanigans when I am in Pittsburgh.  I hope they continue to hire great servers, like Danielle, who provide great customer service and make a great local bar."}
{"text":"I went here with friends and waited for 15 minutes and didn't see one waiter or waitress. Had to go up three times and mention that we were here and they said we'd be there shortly. Nope. Nothing. So I left."}
{"text":"I got the kitchen sink wings and they were the best I've gotten in Pittsburgh. The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the blue cheese dressing. If they make it more chunky then I'd give 5, i wish you could give 4.9. It's clean, good selection, very open, great place to watch the nfl. They have nfl red zone! If it wasn't so far from my house id be a regular. I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had heard all of the commercials about this place, so I had to check it out at least once.  I wish I hadn't.  First off, they allow smoking.  As someone who kicked the habit I can't stand when restaurants allow this. Clearly this place is more of a bar than a restaurant, which is fine, but then they should advertise as such.  While the beer selection isn't too shabby, the bartender was slow. I don't understand why b/c there was only 5 other ppl at the bar.   The bf and I ordered the buffalo chicken fries for an appetizer.....they came out with our meals and had clearly sat under the heat lamp for WAY too long.  Probably b/c the bartender was too busy packing her cigarettes than checking on her customers. In fact the cook had to bring the food out and tell her that it had been sitting there for awhile.   Nothing irritates me more.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla and my boyfriend got the capicola sandwich.  Both of the meals were decent.  Sandwich was a Primanti's rip off, but not too shabby. I did enjoy that my quesadilla had jalapenos and olives.  Because our meals were decent I gave this place two stars.  However, the service was so horrendous I will never be going back to this place.  Honestly, I'm surprised I haven't seen this place on Restaurant Impossible."}
{"text":"So I can't say I remember too much about my night here, but I lost my phone at the bar and they were SO flexible and helpful with me getting it back which I think speaks volumes especially when you're not making tips or any kind of profit from dealing with a drunk girl coming to pick up her phone...completely would be my issue not theirs!   I lost it on a Friday which was also Christmas weekend so it was awesome that I was pretty much screwed for the weekend. Figured out that it was at Shenanigans and emailed the bar on Saturday (Christmas Eve) night and got a call back from the owner literally 10 minutes after I sent the email. Brad is AWESOME, he went completely out of his way to help me. He even offered to make arrangements for me to get my phone back on Christmas Day (obviously the bar was closed both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day so that was pretty amazing of him).   Point is...got my phone back without a scratch on it and received excellent customer service from the owner himself and the bartender when I went to pick it up. These are genuinely NICE people who care about their business and their customers! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"This place has changed significantly in recent months!  It used to be a smoke-filled biker bar but has become a nice smoke-free bar/restaurant with pretty good food.  The brisket sandwich is really good and so are the wings.  The fries are crisp and tasty as well.  There are lots of TVs for watching sports and quite a few beer options.  Outside has a gas fire pit and cornhole games.  I really hope people start frequenting the new Shenanigans so the owner doesn't decide to turn it back to the old smoke-filled bar.  It would be a shame to see this little gem disappear."}
{"text":"Had a great time for a work party. Food was great enjoyed the wings and the pizza the best. A very large selections of beer and other cocktails it was very well priced for the drinks. The party lasted longer than expected because of the dart boards and other games that were located around the bar. If you are ever looking forward in planning a party or having a night out this is a great place for a great time."}
{"text":"Only good thing about this place was the Pirates winning the game on the big screen. Philly cheese steak was incredibly underwhelming and I might as well have tipped myself for service. Had to ask for a menu. Had to ask for condiments. Had to ask for everything. Wouldn't go back if you paid for my meal."}
{"text":"So if you buy your jeans in the Kmart discount rack, smoke newports and think the greasy look is an in thing then this is the place for you. Food tastes like the smoke filled air and you have to take a shower when you get home because you smell like an ash tray from just being in the place.  Service was slow and the bar tenders are more worried about which guy is hitting on them than waiting on actual customers. If you have a brain or a soul you won't go here."}
{"text":"One of the greatest places around!!! Off the main road of McKnight, kitchen open late (Until 1 am) EVERYDAY!! Recent remodel with a badass double corn-hole court equipped with fire pit in the center.  Enclosed smoking area outside for smokers. Games galore; pool, darts, pinball, etc. This place has some of the best specials I've ever seen in a bar, both food and drink. Efficient bar seating and Lots of tables and areas to spread out with your buds. Happy hour menu is honestly too much to ask for, come here with 4 friends and just order everything off the happy hour menu as it's all half price!!  Savin the best for last.... wing flavors!! 30 something flavors, wing night Wednesday, go for the Kitchen seasoning. You'll lick the basket!! You'll lick the friggin basket clean!! A castle for service industry workers."}
{"text":"Poor service! I went with a group of friends after work one night and we saw our server maybe 3 times. The food was okay. We would have had another drink if we had a chance to order it. Overall not impressed. I will sit at the bar for drinks next time!"}
