{"text":"2.5 stars  Half star earned only because I had really good service from the waiter and the greeter. They were attentive.   Food - not good. I had the calamari dinner. Calamari was greasy and I got a number of pieces were the batter was removed from the calamari - not sure if it was on purpose to save on calamari or because the breading stick.   Rice - small portion. Salad - wilted mess. Potatoes - one quarter piece. Not sure where the rest of them went.   I couldn't finish my meal. I was disappointed that I paid $20.00+tax for that!"}
{"text":"I preface by saying I have been a loyal patron of this restaurant for almost 10 yrs. in the early days they were very attentive, professional, great quality and competitively priced. During my most recent visit I have decided to not return again. Why? Service has slowly degraded over the years, seems the popularity has reached the cozy levels and no reason to excel further. For example, asking for water multiple times with a waiter finally snapping back with attitude and saying 'these people were here before you'!  Wow, sorry that I asked.   The food, well, this cuisine in generally very simple to prepare and but they have dropped the ball. The signature saganaki or 'flaming cheese' as some come to know it was substandard. In fact, I strongly believe it was a cheaper cheese blend that closely resembled mozzarella. I know my Greek cheese super well, I grew up with it at home and have had it at Mezes dozens of times. The shrimp dish and fried zucchini once again substandard. The shrimp seemed steamed (as to retain their moisture) and prepared last minute in the pan or broiler, not enjoyable at all. The zucchini was equally as unenjoyable. When I questioned the preparation method I was offered an unprofessional response with the delivery being somewhat belittling.  Once again, sorry for my feedback. Next time don't ask me 'how is everything' if you are not prepared for the constructive criticism.   Coupled with the above, the prices have sky rocketed! People, this is Greek food not some elaborate and complicated cuisine that only a select few capable chefs can manage to prepare.   Sorry Mezes, in my humble opinion, you have taken your eye off the customer experience and dropped the ball. Time to re-evaluate, huddle with your staff, walk the Danforth and see what your competitors are up to. With so many choices on the Danforth there is absolutely no reason why I will continue to visit.   Best wishes,"}
{"text":"The hostess is so discriminating and rude .we came first and she entertain those people who's not asian ."}
{"text":"Favourite Greek place in Toronto thus far! The fried calamari is delicious, as well as the saganaki (fried cheese). Big portions too. Went for an awkward date here, and we at the very least could talk about the delicious food. Finally, friendly and caring staff! Especially when I left my bagged dinner behind."}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite when visiting Toronto. We chose Mezes by chance last year when walking down the street looking for an early dinner on a cold winter's day. We were impressed by the melitzanosalata and lamb chops. Everything tasted like excellent home cooking and the ambiance was laid back and familiar. We came back to Toronto again for Christmas this year and knew we had to return, especially after a mediocre and overly salty dinner at Pantheon a few nights prior. In addition to the melizanosalata and lamb chops, we enjoyed some grilled calamari. The only area of disappointment was the dessert (thus one fewer star), the galaktoboureko was served very cold and was just a cold semolina pudding with some phyllo sheets on top. The quality did not compare to the rest of the meal or to our favorite galaktoboureko served at Evvia in Palo Alto, CA. However, I would come back to Mezes any day just for the melitzanosalata and fresh homemade pita."}
{"text":"A Greek friend recommended this place. Excellent service and food - I had the sautéed shrimp in lemon sauce with vegetables. You can tell they take pride in what they deliver. The décor is also quite nice. Try not to come on a Friday or Saturday night if you're looking for a quiet dining experience."}
{"text":"2.5 stars - not bad / not great.  I came here many years ago and had a good experience, so one night when I was craving greek food, my boyfriend and I made our way over to Greektown. We arrived at Mezes just after 9 and were able to get seated right away, even though it was still pretty busy.  We decided to go with the Assorted pites - A sample of all their pites: Spanakopita, one Tirokafteropita and one Pantzaropita ($8.95).  - Spanakopita (spinach pie): the filling was just too salty for my liking - Tirokafteropita (feta cheese, hot peppers and yogurt): Didn't really taste much of the hot peppers, overall just an okay pite - Pantzaropita (beets, leeks): the filling was so flavourful and delicious. easily my favourite one (although i'm not sure that's saying very much)  Our next dish was the Grilled Kalamari - Fresh grilled kalamari, dressed with a balsamic vinegrette and topped with fresh onions ($13.95). It was grilled nicely and wasn't too chewy. The balsamic vinegrette was also nice. This was a decent dish.  Since we had ordered two starters, we decided to share the Pork Souvlaki Dinner - Served with salad, roast potatoes, and rice ($16.95).  The pork was on the dry side, but tasted okay with the tzaziki sauce. The rice and potatoes were pretty standard. Just a meh dish... and overall, just a meh experience."}
{"text":"I thought Mezes was over-rated. The food is very similar to a bunch of Greek places which are much better value. I thought it was over priced and not all that great."}
{"text":"Great Greek Dinner.  Dip platter and saganaki exceptional.  Moussaka the best I ever had - really!  Service wonderful."}
{"text":"The gyros alone justify the trip out to Danforth and the wait in line. And there is always a wait in line. Always.   The gyros come with fries stuffed which is exactly how it is served in Greece. Also you cant beat the price for a gyro big enough for dinner.The grilled octopus was a delicious suprise. Cooked to perfection without being chewy from over or under cooking.   The atmosphere is happy and hectic, a place to have a good meal with friends, probably not the place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for those with dietary restrictions like SCD. The staff is very open about communicating, and there's plenty on the menu without a trace of gluten. I love the lemon green beans, the souvlaki skewers, the grilled calamari, and they'll even make un-breaded saganaki and serve it with cucumber slices instead of bread. Great service, and when you go with a group and share food, the price is quite reasonable."}
{"text":"The best dips in Greek town. All of the dips taste homemade. I usually get full on the dips even though I order the chicken souvlaki. Most of the time I have to take part of the main entree home as I am usually full half way through.  Allow up to half an hour wait to be seated on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"The place probably deserves a higher score for food, but the service was unpleasant. We ordered a bottle of wine off of the menu-- which clearly said it was a 2008. What arrived was a 2012- a younger red wine than we would have selected. When we questioned the vintage, we were told it was basically cost savings. Fine- if you cannot afford to sell a 2008 at that price and are selling a 2012--change what is printed on your menu. We were not pleased, but the person who'd been called over especially to discuss this with us made no mention of compensating us in anyway for not getting what we orderd.  Other than that, the service was just tollerable..   The food was fine. Nothing was extraordinary."}
{"text":"I've been to Mezes many times in the past, but I stopped going here when I found better options for Greek restaurants.   Their food is good but some dishes can be slightly bland or too salted; the portions are okay, and it's a bit pricey- especially the entrees. They have a good selection of appetizers, combination platters, entrees, salads, soups, and desserts. The staff is nice and service is okay, but it wouldn't hurt if the servers could put a smile on their faces once in a while.  The restaurant is decorated nicely. I hate how the tables are placed too close together. It can get very uncomfortable when strangers are dining right next to you on both sides. That's my major problem about this place. I really don't feel comfortable in the tight setting while dining.   Overall, this is an okay restaurant. However, I'm not a huge fan personally."}
{"text":"Upscale ambience without the upscale prices. Very willing to accommodate food allergies. Their service is quick and efficient. The flavour of the food is excellent and relies on quality ingredients. Very generous portions. It is not my first choice on the Danforth (I prefer the cozy family atmosphere of Avili across the street) but they always provide an excellent experience."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for when we have overseas visitors - great food and good service.  The dip platter is a favourite along with the calamari (deliciously fresh) and the meatballs.  The saganaki is always a crowd favourite too :)"}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service! We made reservations and still had to wait 45 mins for a table. At the end, we ended up splitting up our group of friends to eat because we couldn't wait anymore. Overall, I wouldn't go back. Although the food was good, the service was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"I get take out from there often and I have NEVER been disappointed. The souvlaki is great! Living near the Danforth is great and Mezes could be a major reason why!"}
{"text":"First. We were only half way through our Salads and the Waiter put our entrees in front of us AND we were expected to move our own salads from in front of us. No excuses were made.  I continued to eat my Salad and have my beverage while my dinner went cold.  This is very poor service.   Entre 1. The food is over-priced for the amount of food and the content.  5-6 ounces of chicken on a stick with a plate of Carbs. $21.00  Entre 2. My Musaka was a very small portion (2\"x2\" and about 1 & 1/2\"high ), served with again a plate of Carbs.  $21.00 for this tiny portion of ground beef, a small piece of Eggplant topped with mashed potatoes.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Finally have a chance/time to yelp out of my favorite Greek restaurant in Toronto, with no competition at all... tried in vain to beat the quality & service at some other Greek places in town but just can't help - I keep returning back! They put a spell on me!  The originality of all Greek menus in the city is, understandably disputed, however Mezes beats them all. You will indeed find some of the non-Greek items on the menu, but that is simply the consequence of the high demand - when every second customer asks you if you have Hummus dip in your menu, you will probably want to add it eventually to please them. However, without going too much into the originality & authenticity of the Greek food (I'll leave that for some other time) I must publicly declare that:  1) The service is unbeatable. Friendly. Polite. Fast. You can complain on anything and they will sincerely try to make you happy in any way they can. These guys must have a real good treatment by the owner - I can't explain the level of attention by anything else. The best example is, that once we had a dinner there, we were at the smaller table, looking around to find where to put our used plates, and the server immediately noticed that asking if they can help somehow. Beat that! I took my mom for her birthday there, she raved for days after of how good it was - all of us and the servers together sang a happy birthday song, with them funnily mispronouncing her name, a moment to remember.  2) ANY item you choose from the menu is good quality. Souvlaki is the real stuff. Have it any way and you will be satisfied. You can combine and ask them for modifications as much as you want (a big plus in my book). Have a souvlaki over the salad, or in a pita, or a dinner with the best potatoes and rice but don't forget a side of super fresh feta!! (damn, I'm craving those potatoes now) Lamb chops. As a side, or in a full dinner. Lamb souvlaki. Tons of appetizers (mezes) - dolmades (wine leaf rolls), grilled octopus, filo pastry with beets (awesome treat), you simply cannot go wrong here! The only thing I never tried, is Saganaki - it seems very heavy&greasy for my taste but I never fail to be amused by it's serving ritual and the cheery and grandiose \"OPA\" announcement.  By the time of the Soccer world cup, I also had a chance to discuss the results with the servers. Greeks are big soccer fans and the whole experience in total, IMHO, doesn't get more genuine than that. Their wines even reinforced my opinion that Greece has excellent, under-estimated and under-marketed wine industry. Some of the examples on their extensive Greek wine menu are the perfect example for that. Again you can fully trust the servers to recommend you a good bottle - or simply go with the house wine, both red and white are seriously good quality."}
{"text":"Best souvlaki in gta. We prefer it over messini.  It's always so fresh,  tender and juicy! Even the tatziki is fantastic... :))  mezes never disappoints."}
{"text":"ROBBED!!  I was there earlier today and was quite frankly robbed by our waiter! I tipped him $5 dollars, ok so maybe it was a bit cheap,  but what the waiter did was he came to me and asked me in front of my friends \"you only tipped me $5\" what did I do?, I was embarrassed and shocked and left him a $20. Say I was broke and couldnt really afford anything more but stil tipped the waiter all that could afford, this is in no way how a waiter should treat a customer. I am taking this much much further but I thought I warn you folks.  So unless you are ready to be robbed, don't go here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great service even during busy dinner time.  Cozy atmosphere.  Generous portions.  Good to dine with kids."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic if you're looking for a wider selection of Greek cuisine than Souvlaki and Gyro. Astoria may be a well-known hub, but you really owe it to yourself to branch out a little, and try something new!  The setting is great, decor unique, staff is very attentive and friendly, and this place is welcoming to families and large groups.  My recommendation is to order several starters after their namesake, Mezes (sounds familiar, right? You already speak SO MUCH GREEK already!)   - taramasalata, one of many fantastic dips served with pita bread with a great unique flavour. Don't be turned off by the sound of fish-roe!  - spanikopita (span-ee-co-pita, NOT span-iko-pita) or tiropita (tear-oh-pita) with flaky filo pastry, nom!  - dolmades (dole-mawd-as), stuffed grape leaves just packed with flavour!  - avgolemono (ave-oh-lem-ono) lemony chicken soup, just like Yia Yia makes it  - grilled calamari  To my surprise, they even have a separate gluten-free menu, and were very happy to accommodate my allergy by providing me with sliced cucumber so I may also enjoy the dips!  Keep in mind, portions are small for many starters, excluding the dips. Mains are generously portioned, and doggie-bags are mandatory.  Mezes had a steady line by 8:00pm (Greeks eat late!)"}
{"text":"So I ordered chicken souvlaki on a pita with a side of greek salad. The most obvious choice on the Danforth right?  Well, I didn't expect much, and I was blown away.  The chicken was white meat only and it was super, super, super moist.  So good.  The tzatziki was so rich, and so creamy it made the pita that much better.   We also ordered the eggplant dip as a starter and it was very creamy, very rich in flavour and I wished I could order it to go in a tub.  Only downside was that for a small portion is was kinda pricy at $8 or so.    Desserts were a pass for me-ordered the lemon curd dessert and it just wasn't that good.  It had random lumps in it and I didn't finish it.  We also tested the chocolate baklava and the chocolate cake.  Baklava was uber nutty, and uber sweet-so if that's your thing, do try it.  Chocolate cake was good but just like any other chocolate cake.    If I were on the Danforth again I would absolutely visit Mezes again.  This time I'd probably be more adventurous and try the fish or kalamari, I'd skip dessert and go for fro-yo instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an absolutely incredible experience of good service and quality food.  From the moment we arrived we were treated wonderfully. The food was amazing especially the Lamb chops. They were the most succulent, delicious Lamb chops I have ever eaten.  Yes, that good!  I have no choice but to give this place 5 stars for the whole package...!  The price is also very reasonable for the quality of food they serve. I look forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"Visited this place over the weekend. Good service, good food. Kind of pricey. Had a decent selection of vegetarian options. Would recommend!  It gets very busy though so if you're going on the weekend, make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"The food is addictive and you always leave full. Try the chicken kleftiko and thank me later"}
{"text":"We come here often and the food, service and atmosphere never disappoints. Hands down this is the best Greek food restaurant in Toronto. No one compares. Every time we go somewhere different, we always come back to Mezes. The calamari taste better than my mom makes and that says a lot to me!!!! The food is fresh. I bet if they doubled the restaurant in size, there would still be a line up. Luckily management effectively manages the line up in a way that amazes me and again that speaks volume because I'm a tough cookie."}
{"text":"For the past 3 years, I went to Mezes for my birthday or my boyfriend's birthday.  Their \"Mezes of Rodos\" ($52.95) is what we always get.  It's a BIG plate of fried Kalamari, grilled Octopus legs, fried shrimp, AND shrimps in delicious tomato sauce(i think it's feta-or other cheese-tomato sauce). it comes with Tzatziki Sauce(heavy cucumber+yogurt+sour cream sauce...right?).   Let me just say, all these are cooked to perfection....SPECIALLY THE KALAMARI is SOOOO amazing...!  To me, because of the the way they cook kalamari, they dont even taste like squid. it's just......AHHH.....it's got THIN crispy batter and when you bite into it, it's not chewy that you just get a clean bite of it. (I just teleported to food heaven..)  Anyways.  \"Mezes of Rodos\" is clearly not for two people. No matter how hungry we are when we order the food, we end up eating just half of it and take the rest home.  So this dish is definitely for a big group. It would be perfect to order this dish along with other vegetable and rice dishes."}
{"text":"Took my parents out for dinner. Social after work kind of atmosphere. Like some of the other reviews, the service was very poor. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes with menus before the waiter came and asked us if we wanted a drink. 34° C outside and we had to ask for water.   Our dinners came with salad, which was delivered fast, very fresh and was tasty. About three minutes later our entree came to the table. The guy didn't know who ordered what. We were expected to grab our plates from him and move our 1/2 eaten salads around to make room for the poorly timed entrée.   Overall, the food experience was sub-par. My $21 moussaka was small and my double starch accompaniments (rice and potatoes) were cold.   For the quality / service experience, I recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that you can get small appetizers to share, then Mezes is definitely a place to check out!  Their menu consists of appetizers, as well as some main courses and salads.  My group ordered the tzatziki, the pites plate, saganaki and of course, shots of ouzo!  Everything is was really good, the portions were a good sharing size.  The saganaki was brought to our table, and the waiter poured brandy over it, to make a flambe on it, which was cool!  My only complaint about this place is that the service was sort of slow.  We had to wait a little bit for the waiter to take our order, as well as waiting for a glass of water (to chase the ouzo :P.)  Other than that, it's a great place to go, if you enjoy Greek food, and a really loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. I felt like I was back in Crete eating the local cuisine.  I like that the food was not oversized on huge plates which has become the American way but on smaller plates, the European way. I will be back."}
{"text":"My sis and I randomly came across Mezes a few months ago.  Since then, I have been back a few times.    My favs: Dip platter (the shrimp cocktail dip, baba ganoush dip are soooo DELICIOUS), deep fried calamari ( I heard grilled ones are good too, but their deep fried was really GOOD... super tender, done just perfectly), pork soulvaki is great too!  If you are craving for calamari, this is the place to be!  In terms of atmosphere, it's more on the casual side and service is so-so..."}
{"text":"So many choices running up and down the street.  How do you choose? Actually this place has been on my list for about 2 years. So even though I had to steer my husband here, and we kept looking up the road a bit, we ended up back here.  For starters the inside is nice, BUT, it kinda looks like a blacksmith vomited in there.  Someone needs to put the reigns on this tangled mess of metalwork.  There was some decorative painting along the stairs to the downstairs bathroom...kinda nice, and a soothing relaxing blue and cream palette that was quiite nice.  The noise level was loud and festive.  The appetizer dip plate Kria Polikiliea is an array of Taramosalata--a caviar and potato spread that was new to me, eggplant based dip, houmos, and Tztziki.  The serving was generous, but we had to ask for another pita.  The Quail appetizerwas delicious as my meal.  My husband had the Lamb boneless  I'm not a fan of the texture of the rice, but it seems pretty consistent through all of the Greek places I go, so I suppose it's me, not them."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Mezes Cuisine: Greek Location: Greektown Address: 456 Danforth Ave Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 5  Service: 4  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4.5   Extra information:  * Open for lunch & dinner  * Open 7 days a week * http://www.mezes.ca  One foodie tip I continuously follow is that when I meet someone from different culture, I always ask them what they think is the best/authentic restaurant in town. I've done this for as long as I can remember, and it usually guides me toward the right direction. Sure, there were couple times where it was a miss, but most of the time- I can depend on them.  Also, if you ever ask this question, people are usually very happy to answer you. They usually like the fact that you are interested in their cuisine and wants to explore into it. Anyways, I say this because I found out about this restaurant through a co-worker who's Greek. He told me that he thinks they serve the most authentic Greek food in Toronto and that was enough to convince me. If you know me, you know I don't like half-assed fusion food!  On a slow monday afternoon, I dropped by Mezes to check out their food. I did arrive a little later in the afternoon around 1:30PM and the restaurant was pretty empty. We were seated by the window which was awesome cause it was a nice, sunny day!  Once you walk into the restaurant, you can def feel touches of Greece here and there. I loved the colorful details along the wall and details with interior design.  Ordered: Kria Poikilia (small) 4/5   * 4 types of dip: Tzatziki, Taramosalata, Homous and Melitzanosalata served with pita bread for $8.95 * I love it when they have platters like this so I get to try more things * Tzatziki was super fresh and not too sour, just the right amount of creaminess of the yogurt with refreshing cucumber scent and lots of garlic * It was my first time trying Taramosalata Dip which is a red caviar dip with purred potatoes, extra virgin olive oil and lemon * Taramosalata dip was probably my least favorite, it was good but I didn't like the starchy taste from the potato (almost like light potato salad) * Homous was thick and bursting with flavors of onion and garlic * Melitzanosalata Dip is made with baked eggplant, onion, garlic and extra virgin olive oil * This dip tasted like light veggie dip which went perfectly with the pita bread * This was served with 2 garlic pita bread, it was warm and cut into 4 pieces * I could have used more pita bread since there was so much dip  Saganaki 5/5  * Flavorful Kefalograviera cheese pan-browned and then flambeed with brandy for $9.95 * Does not include pita bread ( need to order one as a side) * I've tried this at other locations, but never a proper one where they actually flambeed it properly at your table! * Cheese is very much like mozarella cheese but less stringly, lighter and has much more flavor * Even with the pita bread, it is a little salty but overall, it's just cheesy goodness in your mouth!  Ordered: Kalamari 5/5  * Plate of deep fried kalamari served with Tzatziki dip for $12.95 * One of the best I've ever had!! and I am quite picky with these * They use bigger kalamari that is super fresh * Batter is very light and it doesn't overpower the kalamari * Their Tzatziki dip is SO good I completely over-loaded on them (heaven) * This is a big dish so it would be good shared as an appetizer * Must Get when you visit  Fakkes 3/5  * Meal size Lentil soup with vegetables, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil and lemon for $7.45 * My mom wanted soup so we ordered this but I am just not a big fan of lentil * But I did try some and it is very tasty- I just wouldn't choose to order it as my main dish * It is a good vegetarian option if you want something healthy  Ordered: Lamb Souvlaki Dinner 4/5  * Lamb Souvlaki served with rice, salad and roast potatoes for $19.95 * They ask you how you like the lamb cooked, I asked for medium rare * Given it's price and how it is a dinner plate, it is big in portion * I was surprised to see how the salad wasn't your typical Greek salad with the chopped up cucumber and tomato pieces? (which I would have preferred if there was a option) * Rice was light and roasted potatoes were cooked perfectly, fluffy! * There was about 5~6 big chunks of the lamb which was cooked just right * The meat had bit of fat on them which I liked so that it's not too dry * It's also served with side of Tzatziki dip (can't get enough!!)  Summary: I love Mezes, they serve simple Greek food- nothing fancy and that's what I enjoy. They stick to what they know and everything tastes super fresh and the strong flavors just makes it better. I think I found my favorite Greek spot in Toronto, I am def going back to try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Mezes many times over the last five years and I keep going back for two reasons, the people and the food. I've come to know the owners well simply because they made an effort get to know me and because the staff are genuinely good people who care about what they do.  Everything I have had on the menu is awesome. I recommend going with a group of friends and ordering appetizers and side dishes so that you are able to try a bit of everything. My favorite items are the grilled calamari, the saganaki, the spanakopita, and the piperies kafts gemistes. If you have no idea what these dishes are, I suggest you go to Mezes and find out for yourself.  TIP: Ask for Tony and tell him that you are friend's with Konstantinos."}
{"text":"Late night food that is healthy and well done. Lots of meat and veggie options. The staff are attentive. The place is very busy but they do a good job of getting your meal out. The skordslia (potato and garlic dish)was awesome. Even better was the maroulosalata which was a simple salad with lemon and dill."}
{"text":"Quality is average. Have had better food at mom and pop place down the street near jackman. Chicken souvlaki dinner was not very generous portion wise and you're paying a couple extra bucks compared to other places. Have other neighbouring restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Mezes was high on the Yelp recommendation list for the Danforth when we were looking for an early dinner spot in good old Greektown.  When we arrived, they were able to accomodate our request for having a spacious table for my friend's baby stroller.  Our server recommended that we order a small dip platter to share while we decided our entrees.  The dips were delicious, garlicky and rich with flavour.  What we ordered: Calamari - one of the best fired calamari I have had in the city; the rings were thick and not overtly greasy Grilled Calamari - very good as well, it is hard to choose between the grilled and fried Horiatiki - classic greek salad that super yummy, the fresh feta cheese was just heavenly Garides Rodou - shrimps with a rich feta tomato based sauce - delish, ask for bread to gobble up the extra sauce  Service was top-notch, they were attentive and even brought out extra plates because we were sharing dishes.  I will definitely be back to try out the other menu items.  Check out Mezes when you are on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mezes for Winterlicious and it was very a average Greek fare.  But I decided to give it another try, because the interior is really nice and place is pretty busy (which means something, right?). This time we got mezes. Good call! We got a large platter with lima beans for 2 and a skewer of chicken, lamb and veggies each. All delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant and the food is good. I do feel like the food is a bit expensive for what it is though..  If you're considering coming here, DO NOT come on a Saturday night or any other busy days. The line up is out the door and you will almost always end up waiting around 30-45 minutes just to be seated. If a place has days where it's this busy, they should really consider moving to a larger location."}
{"text":"One of my biggest fears growing up as a kid is eating chicken that tastes like rubber. Fortunately my order at the Greek \"Mezes\" had the chicken done just right. Unfortunately, that is all the good I can give this dish.  The \"Zinnis rice special\" here at Mezes, Toronto, comes with a sizzling skillet of rice topped with a sauté of kalamari, pork, chicken, fresh tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and herbs.  What was bad: the taste of tomatoes is strong and it overwhelms all other flavors in a most disproportionate manner.    Rating: 3/10. Yelp rating would be 3 divided by two which is 1.5/5 then.  Meaning of rating: I personally wouldn't go there if I had a choice, but if your friend insists, then why the hell not."}
{"text":"down to earth, thoroughly delicious greek food. incredible lamb, seafood and veggies. perfect service"}
{"text":"Tip: get a reservation. This is a MUST.  We went at 8:15 on a Friday night. I'm not much of a fan of Greek food, but the experience was a delight of rustic charm and great food.  1. Service Did I say rustic charm? The staff HAS IT. All Greek, all men, they were friendly and attentive, full of masculine vigor and willing to chat despite the constantly full restaurant.  2. Food To die for. As a meatatarian, I absolutely adored their kebabs. The pork and chicken were gently seared and very moist. The lamb was cooked and spiced to perfection and not gamey. The garlic butter pita was traditional but very flavorful. My partner loved their cold mashed garlic potatoes.  3. Atmosphere Loud. Raucous. Always full of people enjoying food,wine and company. If you're looking for something less busy, noisy, or more romantic, this place may not be for you. Could be a bit dim for some.  4. Experience This is Greek hospitality at its finest. While you may still need to wait even if you got a reservation, the food and staff make it worth the effort. It's a bit difficult to chat if you have hearing issues or are soft spoken. That's the only reason for a four out of five; it's not great for intimate conversation.  I definitely recommend this place for everyone!"}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could! Seriously, the food is great and the staff are even better than the food they serve. So in short, they give you both food and a good experience.   The main course is always served with a side dish of Greek salad, which is on the house. It's always fresh, even on 11:45 pm! I'm told that the people in the kitchen prepare every salad after one orders a dish. The main course as far as I have tried are good and fresh. Their food is simply delicious.   And the staff!!! So, they have this attitude towards the costumers which is really pleasing. The first time I was there a gentleman asked me, with a joking tone of course, why it was the first time we met and where I've been? The next time my wife and I were going back home from a concert and we decided to go there. It was half an hour before they close but they treated us no different. They were friendly, hospitable, and kind like always. So, as I said before, I'd eat here everyday if I could!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food was fantastic. We had a mix of things- shrimp, dips, calamari and a beef and chicken dish. Everything was fresh and homemade. Service was great. Only downside- it was very busy and very loud- but what can you expect on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I've visited Mezes several times with my girlfriend. This is her favourite restaurant in Greek town and I always have a delicious meal. Firstly the custom made wrought iron Candelabras and bench seating add a nice feel and ambiance to the restaurant. The investment to customize the restaurant and add that hint of sophistication comes through and makes you feel like they really care about the business. Also with many places that have ornate decorum they don't clean well but I've never seen any dust or dirt anywhere. The tables are a little bit close together and waiters will often bump you as they are walking through. But the staff is always polite and courteous. The food is slightly overpriced but I tend to feel that way compared with mr. Greek or the food court because if you're a classic souvlaki kind of diner then the dishes don't really offer too much difference in taste or quality compared to the cheaper options. However if you explore into the menu a bit deeper there are some great dishes. Their moussaka and saganaki are delicious. The waiters also do the at table flambee and \"Opa!\" For the extra Greek authentic feel. Overall a nice restaurant, great for a date or family meal with quality dishes. Only thing I don't like on the menu is the squid. Very standard bland deep fried calamari that you could probably get at any bar for half the price."}
{"text":"Great greek food in Greektown!  Love the sidewalk dining space.  Grilled pork kabobs were very tasty. Taramasalata was our second favorite. (The best being Dafni--42nd street in NYC)  Don't miss dessert."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night.   Pros: - Professional servers  - Good food  Cons - Very pricey for the portions"}
{"text":"This was late lunch at this spot on Sunday. We were a larger group and ordered a few items.  First the Large Kria Poikilia (assorted Mezes) All were decent IMO. We went through them quick. I liked the octopus.  Now for the main were told the portions are big so I decided to order the quails. Rest of the dc stuck to Souvlaki.  The main come with a salad which was decent. Hmm the quails were just bland. Devoid of taste and not very meaty. The sides of potato was OK and the rice was forgettable.  I did try the saganaki as dc ordered it as well. Great to get attention though no my kind of cheese (way too salty). The wine list is off beat and had some interesting options.  Service was OK. Interestingly the server spilled water on me and didn't even bother to say sorry. The washrooms are filthy. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Overated, food  had little taste , service was bad, not worth the higher prices they charge"}
{"text":"Standard fare at a premium price. We came here looking for something authentic and good.  We found Mezes to be more mediocre.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was excellent, the hostess was pleasant, the food was a disappointment, just mediocre and the bill didn't match, the bill was high for what it was. The place was busy and it was a good pleasant crowd, it was very very noisy which both I and my friend Jennifer did not like. I had the lamb pie wrapped in filo dough which was very dry and Jennifer had the standard souvlaki.  I would have to say it was not special and more disappointing than anything else. I would not go back. Seems like the good places are closing down on Danforth leaving only the mediocre places to fight it out. There use to be good food on Danforth, those days might be over."}
{"text":"Good food had the chicken souvlaki Light on the pita vs dip portion"}
{"text":"Delicious Saganaki (flaming cheese of yum!) and cute restaurant . It's a bit cramped and noisy but the service was good and the food was great !"}
{"text":"Jim's post below is spot on! Been here many times in the past but of late, poor service, having to repeatedly ask for items they forget to bring you that are supposed to accompany the meal (as per their own menu). Still waiting for my salad right now. Taste of the Danforth, this place had empty tables, that should have been a sign to me that things have changed and everyone knows it. Manager asked me when I was leaving how everything was. I was honest with him but he still charged me full price for food I never received. Please come again he said, next time we will be better. I am afraid there won't be a next time. The place is surrounded by way better places of better value and quality of food and service."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars because the waiter was nice and attentive, even though I went there for my lil girl birthday and told them about that, nobody come to sing her Happy Birthday, she was very sad :(  ...while two other customers were sang to - I assumed they were just busy and confused.   It would have gotten a 5 star but the 'Greek fries' @ $7 were a big disappointment - I would have never expected fries made from frozen grocery potatoes in a Greek restaurant!!! topped with feta and called 'Greek'.  Else I'm a vegetarian and the dish I ordered was a tad disappointing \"Vegetarian Platter at $17.00 described as Souvlaki of marinated vegetables, delectably grilled.\" It was mostly zucchini which I don't like because is GMO and no mushrooms or onions; however I enjoyed the side dishes the rice and potatoes, I was really hungry. My other daughters, one had fried calamari  they smelled really good and the other chicken soulaki which she ate it all so that means it was good because she is really a connoisseur and would not eat something if it's not good. The dish I ordered was overpriced for what it offered,. Else was all good and a lovely place to go to."}
{"text":"Came during taste of the Gyro. Very pricey for the portions.  Wish I went to Messini who arn't shy with the tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"Went here to try for the first time. Service was terrible. Ie. Waiter did not check in on us to see how the food was or if we needed something  else. Also food was not hot at all, lukewarn at best. Table next to us got all the attention while we were ignored. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I had to needle my friend to eat here and it proved worth the effort.  A quick visual survey of the patrons noted that many were Greek, and among them, many were old, Greek men.  Older Greek gentlemen sitting around, gabbing and sipping kaffe or ouzo really upped the authentic vibe.  Although heavily Hellenic, the other patrons proved to be a real eclectic mix of couples on dates and families enjoying an early supper. !Oupa!  Overall, the general atmosphere was relaxing and welcoming.  The walls were adorned with metal vines that held my attention for a while. The waitstaff was both friendly and mellow... and the food fantastic! When dining out, I often like to go for food that either I can't make or would otherwise be too labor intensive. So, I chose moussaka as a main dish.  It's a simple dish (like a Greek noodle-less lasagna)of potatoes, eggplant, zuchhini, bechamel and ground meat but takes some serious time to put together.  Their version was smooth, buttery and oh-so-pleasantly filling.  My friend ordered chicken souvlaki.  She must have loved it for when I went to grab a bite of chicken from her plate, I swear I heard her growl.  We ate entirely too much food when there as we also split two appetizers (mezes):  pita + Melitzanosalata (eggplant) dip and an olive sampler plate in addition to the rice, salad, and potatoes that came with our meal. Then, we ordered some baklava to share but had to take it to go (and ate it on the car ride back to New York).  When we arrived back state-side, we both felt a little sick but happy.  Mostly happy."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and staying with my friend's Greek family. My friend took me here as it's her favorite Greek restaurant in the city. I trusted her since she's Greek :)  This is definitely the best Greek restaurant I've been to. Most of the food is outstanding. My favorites included the lamb chops, baba ganoush, tzatziki, homous, taramosalata, and tirokafteri. The Greek salad and the stuffed spicy peppers were just ok. Feta Dodonis is a must-have however you decide to get it. Saganaki is also a fun experience as they light it up at your table.  If you're in Toronto, this restaurant is a must. Expect to wait to be seated for dinner. Our wait was only 20 minutes or so though, which wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"We're visiting Toronto and ended up in Greek Town at the recommendation of our Airbnb host. Not knowing the area, we walked up and down Danforth until we decided on the small plates at Mezes. We started with drinks: Skinos with lemonade for me and on the rocks for my husband. We've not had this before and found it delicious. Light and slightly herbal, it mixes nicely with lemonade. For dinner, my husband had the lamb chops and the tiger shrimp in a light wine and lemon sauce, served with vegetables. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. The lamb chops were done just right and served with a side of tzatziki. I had the Rodos Salad: mixed greens with figs, goat cheese, honey roasted walnuts drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette   It was awesome. We unfortunately left no room for dessert. I would highly recommend Mezes to anyone."}
{"text":"The whole experience was a 10 for us.  The food was fantastic. The saganaki was my favorite. Highly recommend it if you're in the Danforth area! Our server was also super cool!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, pleasant ambiance. Good vegetarian options. Cons: very loud, very busy."}
{"text":"I almost froze walking from the subway station the other afternoon trying to find this place, but after nearly contracting frostbite in single digit temperatures, the trek was well worth it.  I went on a quiet afternoon with my friend when only a few other tables were full, so we received prompt and attentive service.    I started out with a plate of humous as an appetizer, that was served with pita glazed with a light olive oil.  From there I had the lamb \"Kleftiko\", which was pieces of roasted lamb with onions, spinach, tomatoes and cheese wrapped in a phylo dough shell.  This course came accompanied with a very generous portion of rice and salad.    Having finished the humous plate myself, the main course made me feel like a glutton suffering from a serious food coma!    I felt the meal itself was flavorful and satisfying, so the walk back to the train station in the freezing winter didn't seem all that bad afterwards.  I would not hesitate to return on a repeat trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it. Went for dinner around 7 pm on a weeknight. Lots of people dining but the service was quick. They started us off with bread and butter. We ordered the dinner plates - I ordered the lamb leg, served salad (which came rife after the bread), and rice and potatoes. Portions are large; I even had to bring some home. Everything tasted fresh especially the salad greens and the lamb was cooked so well; felt like it melted in my mouth. The food came out pretty quick. I would highly recommend trying out this restaurant in Greektown!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night this week and I must say say the food is really good. I'm a big fan of Greek food (albeit I only order the souvlaki dinners). The restaurant is right on danforth and portrays a great example of Greek food on that street. We ordered the Fried Calamari and two chicken souvlaki dinners (each dinner comes with a side of bread, salad, roasted potatos, rice and chicken). Waiters are friendly and make an effort to make sure that you are helped. The prices are a slightly  more expensive but considering the quality of the food, i would say its well worth it. Not a person that really cares about Gluten Free stuff, but if you are, this place has a variety of offerings for Gluten Free items. Definitely a place to try if your in the area."}
{"text":"Living in Greece and having eaten Greek food all my life, it takes a lot to wow me...but Mezes definitely did.  Great atmosphere, great people working there and great food and wine.  Had the lamb chops and they were cooked and seasoned perfect, very juicy and tasty.  Saganaki cheese was perfectly cooked and it went well with the white wine I discovered... an amazing wine that I hadn't even tried in Greece....Tetramythos Roditis, it was light bodied and well balanced with a touch of herbs and lemon great value for the quality.  Next time I am in Toronto I will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 12 years now, on and off with huge gaps in between. Originally I used to come for the Mezes platters with some of the guys, both the small one and the large one (large about $15). So why do I find myself there from time to time? Maybe nostalgia? I am not sure.  I have gone to other places but for some reason this one keeps coming up. For example, I do like their patio --which is covered, and I like to sit there in the summer for people watching and sitting with friends (4-6 tops) as the patio is not that big. And when I wanted something cheap to eat, I would sit, get a glass of wine and a few  lamb or pork souvlakis which comes with pita and  tzatziki for about $2.50 each, although they are more like $3.99-ish now.   However the problem I find is that I have seen the prices creep up over the years while say, the variety of Mezes got a bit cheaper in selection so that has rubbed me the wrong way. Since I expect the quality of the food to at least catch up with prices or at least try to stay the same, not worse. Which it has slightly so some might call it expensive.  Having said that, it is a relatively safe place for anniversaries and maybe second dates, it's tasty but I had better. We recently took a family member who *never* had Greek food and we had the meat platter ($45-ish) plus a large Mezes and a few appetizers and a bottle of wine ($130 in the end for three people) and although again it was not the best I ever had, everyone seems quite satisfied.  Plus the couches on the edges of the tables are comfortable and the overall vibe of the place is somewhat rustic with some Mediterranean colour accents.   As someone else said, because they are long bench/couches against the wall, maybe one might feel that the party next to you might be a bit  close, personally I do not mind it. I mean, in the old country, things are like that and no one cares. So it depends on your cultural and personal preference.   Some might say that it might be a bit expensive for what it is and I might agree, hence I do not go as often as I used to 6 years ago, although at the same time, this place is always packed during the dinner rush. Sometimes the line goes out the door. So they are doing something right. But currently I have a current opening for another *Greek Base* to try out though.    Funny gossip of note: Many years ago, apparently the the wife of the owner cheated with one of the servers, just like the wife of the owner of Mr. Greek.  Why I know that, I used to get along with some of the waiters a few years ago. Mind you, I do not know how much of that is true. Although the part about the wife of the owner of Mr. Greek is true."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for weekday lunches four or five times now. It's always been excellent. Friendly service, big portions, great food, not too busy. It might be different in the evenings or on the weekends.  I've enjoyed: - Kotopoulo Horatiko - Taramosalata - Homous - Dolmades - Octapodi Skaras (not like any octopus I've had elsewhere; tasty)  The lamb chops by the piece are decent without being spectacular."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I'll give credit where it's due. The food quality here is definitely higher than the standard Greek fare, although it also comes with a higher price. The ambiance is nice and it's usually busy, which gives it a very lively feel.  On our latest visit though, I had some issues. First, the place was clearly understaffed. After waiting 15 minutes for a table, we were seated but had to wait about 20 minutes before we go any service. It was a weekday, and the place was surprisingly packed, but the lack of service that night was a bit disappointing.  More importantly though, and the reason why I'd seriously reconsider visiting here again, was that the food was INCREDIBLY salty. Sure, everything was tasty, but they cook with more salt than a Chinese restaurant. I felt it in my mouth the rest of the night and even the next morning. My mother, who suffers from high blood pressure, felt it almost immediately, and actually had to stop eating because she was getting a headache. This place must be salt-crazy, because they even have salt shakers on the table!! It's incredible. If they're trying to give their patrons heart-attacks, then they're well on their way to succeeding. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is known as a famous Greek restaurant in Toronto. Interior is average, so as the food. The food portions are huge, reminded me of the extra large food court servings. Also, we came in on the weekday and still experienced a huge line-up and a 30 mins wait."}
{"text":"It was so loud, it was hard to enjoy our evening.  Atmosphere a two.  The food was a four, but really not any better then we've had for less money.  We ordered the hummus, lentil soup, and chicken in a pita.  Good food but nothing stood out.  The better service was received for regulars dining in big groups.  Not good enough to repeat."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food and great service and great ambience. Lamb chops are amazing, Kalamari was amazing, spanikopita ON POINT! Everything was just really good."}
{"text":"Rambunctious Restaurant full of life and culture. Perfectly explenfies Greek Culture.  Price: $$$ a little bit pricy Service: Average, understaffed, wait time is long Food: Very Good Ambience: Beautiful setting, comfortable seats  Worth it? Yes  Worth noting:  -their lunch and dinner menus are the same, does not have set menus, but entrees + small app combo. -Wide array of appetizers  -Very Vegetarian Friendly  We walked in for lunch, the place was certainly packed full and many of the customers seemed to be returning customers.  Service was mediocre, bus boys would ignore us and getting the attention of staff was pretty difficult, the wait time for our food to come was pretty long as well.  The food was great flavourfull and creamy, could definately tell it came from a recipe not from a book or the internet.  Would highly reccomend as i know greek street has many options but few restaurants that are actually good."}
{"text":"The food used to be good and superb when I went with a Greek friend.  The service has declined over the years and up until the most recent visit it has very much so disappointed me.  Came here with a few friends and our bill was about $380 and we were left without a thank you for your business or see you next time.  These little things are what I look for in repeat visits at a restaurant especially where there are vast competitions with exact food on the same street.   We ordered a lot and the foods were ok but did notice the flavour has declined from before and our souvlaki was hard and dry.  The worst was we ordered saganaki (flaming cheese) and the gentleman lit the flame shortly before he even got to our table and just put it down.  Excuse me but where was our OPA???  I get it you didn't give two crap about our table but why the difference in treatment because I observed your attitude was 180 and friendly with other patrons.  Makes me kind of upset with their attitudes, didn't give any smiles or speak when taking our orders.  Almost felt like I was at a mute restaurant.   Thanks for declining business as we will be not visiting after 10 years of our patronage."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food in a casual atmosphere.   The Assorted Pites were awesome. There is the spicy, addictive one (Tirokafteropita), the earthy, surprisingly delicious one (Pantzaropita), and the expected spinach-filled-goodness one (Spanakopita).   The stuffed grape leaves (Dolmades) were what I was after. They were yummy! They were spicy, but not too spicy. Very satisfying.   We also had the lentil soup (Fakkes) and the Avgolemono. Both seemed healthy and flavourful. I prefer my Avgolemono to be thicker, but it was okay. There was a small garlic bread stick served with the Fakkes, and for the Avgolemono they gave us a whole loaf of complementary bread and butter (in addition to the one that started off the meal).   It was a bit loud inside, but the service was very good, and I don't have any serious complaints. The pricing seemed a little odd to me. Why the stuffed grape leaves should be more expensive than the pites, or why soup should be just as expensive as the pites was curious. It wasn't completely unreasonable, but it wasn't cheap, either."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! A group of friends and I, after a month of struggling to get together, decided to a little dinner outing to Mezes on a Thursday night - this place was ridiculously busy and a bit loud (but to be expected with that many people). So, definitely make a reservation.  No one can ever complain about wine and Greek food - always tasty! Our server was super nice and helpful. Even at the end of the night when I wanted cheesecake to go and he told me they were out, I ordered the chocolate truffle -- reluctant to try the classic baklava and he put a free piece in my \"to go\" bag to try. He claims it's one of the best in the cities -- I'll find out tonight when I open that container. :)  Would definitely return. My friend's grilled octopus looked mighty tasty!"}
{"text":"The emphasis here is on sharing; and with a menu as appetizing looking as Mezes', it'd be difficult to limit yourself to your meal alone. So over lots of wine, my friend and I made our way through plates of dip, roasted lamb (her), various veggie filo puff pastries (me) and some kind of stuffed eggplant concoction (her). My friend was a bit critical of the taramosolata and compared it to mayonnaise mixed with tuna, and the pita was a bit wanting--it wasn't very soft and was drenched in grease--but everything else was lovely.   The atmosphere was lively and the mood was regularly punctuated with various waiters serving saganaki, which is pan-browned cheese that is later flambéed with brandy."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday around 6 and found seating quickly. But just after that a line started forming. Very surprised seeing how the food and service is just mediocre. For over $20/person on food alone I was expecting better."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I sat in a Greek Restaurant. I've always liked it, but never found a good enough reason to venture out to the Danforth for a meal. I ended up here for a family lunch. It was my brother's choice and I thought it was a good idea. Greek food, Greek desserts, and window shopping after wards.   Mezes was a decent restaurant. The space was nicely decorated, medium sized and hosted enough customers to make us feel like we made a good choice going in.   For appetizers, we had dip platter with pita, calamari, and saganaki (flambeed cheese). Dips were good, calamari was tender and the cheese was salty, gooey, and delicious.  For the entree I shared the Aegean Fare Platter which was a chicken and beef stew with onions, peppers and mushrooms. The sauce was tomato, wine, and brandy. It was far too sour and it didn't come with rice to mellow it out.   Overall, it's a calm family restaurant. Nothing special popped out of the menu. The basics of Greek cuisine were offered, nothing else. The food was good and priced a tad bit expensive but still fair. Service was nice and available too. It's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Loved their calamari. Service is very good, definitely recommend it esp for large groups. One of the best on the strip!!"}
{"text":"Everything about Mezes, for its genre/price point, was 4 stars.  The dish featured good, plentiful food and the service was efficient and amicable.  The last time, the weather was good enough to be able to eat outside, where people seemed to be in a good mood.  This restaurant has been on Danforth, the heart of Toronto's Greektown , for a long time.  One can take the TTC (underground rapid transit) and exit the subway nearby, or find street parking at night.  Regardless of how you got there, you will probably feel you made a good choice for Greek food."}
{"text":"Fast service, had the meat Mousaka - very filling; place filled up fast during main dinner  hours."}
{"text":"We've been to Mezes maybe three or four times over the last year, and we've been completely satisfied each time with their fresh take on Greek classics.  The decor here is a bit nicer than some of the other restaurants along this stretch of the Danforth, and it's great for a party of 2, but it does feel a bit cramped for any more than that, depending on where you're seated.  The food is consistently excellent, from the Souvlaki to the Lamb Chops (by the piece!).  You must absolutely get an order of the Skordalia (Potato/Garlic/Olive Oil dip), it is a meal unto itself and is deeelicious.  One of our Greek friends tells us that the Kalamari and the Octopodi here are the best in Greektown, and to my lesser-attuned palate, I have to agree.  Service is good, not great, and this isn't necessarily the best place to bring little kids (a mistake we once made with our nephew), but you just need to be aware, it doesn't detract from the experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food tempered by absurd prices.   I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner. I got 4 medium sized pieces of chicken breast souvlaki, 4 potatoes and half the plate covered in a really nice Greek salad. All tasted superb, but that should not cost $19. Nor should my wifes vegetarian moussaka portion which was about 2\" cubed. Once again, great tasting but not worth it. Especially on Danforth where there is so much selection and competition for great Greek food.   We starts with the saganaki: the kids loved the fire and I loved the taste; my wife found it way to lemony. My kids ordered re breaded cod fish (like a fish and chips without the chips). The fish didn't look too great, but they enjoyed it.   Overall, my wife and I loved the food but I don't want to return due to the price. She does want to return because she says the veggie moussaka is the best there is in Toronto. I will take her at her word, I am a carnivore."}
{"text":"Anything East of Yonge is so foreign to me, I feel like I'm in another city. And with all the different Greek restaurants lining the street, it's easy to fall into a tourist trap in this destination neighborhood. The dip platter is excellent (especially the tzatziki and the taramosalata, they'll give you extra large portions of just the two, if you ask) and the mains are huge.   Just order some appetizers and share a main. Everything is simple, fresh, and delicious. Now that we know a great spot, we've been more excited to venture away from the west end and explore more of the city."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always enjoyed the food.  Might be my favorite Greek restaurant on the Danforth.  I typically go for the chicken souvlaki dinner which is flavorful and filling.  My friends have said that the lamb souvlaki is great as well.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu but the place is generally packed.  It's small so it will be difficult to accomodate large groups.  Service has always seemed good to me.  Wait staff seem to be seasoned."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a pal a few weeks ago. We decided on an early dinner so it wasn't too busy at 5:30; however, when we left at 6:30, there were a lot of people beginning to enter Mezes. Service was excellent; portions were large. The menu here is not unique as you can find most of these items anywhere on the Danforth, but the decor here is ecclectic with a variety of tiles."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for greek!!! absolutely the best \"small plate\" greek food!!! tons of selections to share and nibble on! the good old fashioned greek standbys are available but id deff go out and try some of the more traditional fare... the grilled octopus, pureed potato and garlic, zucchini slices and lima beans in tomato sauce are my default choices and theyre soooo good... also really good for vegetarians out there!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Greek food. It's amazing and Mezes is a great choice! We have been there on numerous occasions for group celebrations. I love it!"}
{"text":"Went there recently for my mom's 60th birthday. Definitely make a reservation as it gets supet busy on the weekend. The food is tasty but very garlicky: my main complaint is the service. Busy is good but hire more servers! Took us an hour to get our food and the servers were just running around like mad.  I dunno, something turned me off about my last meal there, I won't be rushing back"}
{"text":"I Loved this place. Great seafood, great appetizers, good wine. I highly recommend the Calamari platter, and the potatoe"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night and by 8pm, the place was bumping!   Food - stellar. You can order small plates to share with your fellow diners, which is highly recommended. However, they do have full entrees if you'd prefer not to share. I highly recommend the caviar dip, spanikopita, the rodos salad, and the lamb chops. I had the greek fries too, which were good. What I loved was that we were able to share all the plates, but order our own proteins (chicken skewer, lamb chop, etc).   Drinks - they have a wine list - not sure about cocktails but I wouldn't be surprised if they had the regular bar rail available. I enjoyed a glass of white.   Vibe - this is a lively restaurant to enjoy good food and good company. Every so often someone will order the flaming cheese and that always gets a rise out of the crowd. There were also a few birthdays here! Service was very friendly and attentive.   Price wise, we ordered more food than we could finish, and 2 glasses of wine (total for the table) - came to about 26$ each. Not bad at all!   I have only positive things to say about this place. Since I haven't tasted all the greek food that is out there, I can't say this is the best, but its my favourite place on the danforth so far."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First time trying Greek food in Toronto on a recommendation from a Greek colleague, and it was fantastic. Love the laid back authentic atmosphere of this restaurant (lots of little details, nothing fancy, colour and laughter everywhere).   I regretted not ordering the flaming cheese (have to find it on the menu next time!) and went for the 4 dip appetizer and 3 Pites to share. Unusual flavour combos (beet, spinach, feta, peppers) - fresh, hot and goooood.   The mains were great too albeit a little pricey (c. $21) but portions were massive so I understand why. Everything came with a full serving of salad, rice and potatoes - that's a lot of food! I took half of my mousaka home and now I can't wait til breakfast.    My partner got the \"famous\" calamari and was really impressed. It was fresh and straight from the fryer, and again, they didn't skimp on portion size.   4 out of 5 because I always hold off the full ***** til I give it a second try. Which I definitely will again soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times i have not been disappointed. Originally I ventured out to Greek town to go to Pantheon but there was a lineup so I had to opt for something else. I got the last table left at around 6:30 and we ordered fried calamari, tzatziki with garlic pita, lamb chops, and dolmades.  Tzatziki with garlic pita was tasty but all of our dishes came with tzatziki so we couldn't finish the bowl we ordered. The tzatziki was garlicky and creamy but the garlic pita didn't have a pronounced garlic flavor. The lamb chops cooked medium rare was perfection. I was contemplating ordering more! The dolmades doesn't need a squeeze of extra lemon juice as it is already very sour. This was the only dish I didn't like. Lastly, if you take a look around at the restaurant every table has an order of fried calamari. 'Nuff said. The total for all 4 items was about $50 taxes included."}
{"text":"We had a nice family dinner here.  The portions are enormous.  We liked the chicken souvlaki and fried calamari.  The white Greek wine was interesting, too. Of course, the hit of the dinner was the flaming Greek saganaki cheese. opa!"}
{"text":"Our go-to Greek place on the Danforth, Mezes will have a line even when every other place is empty. Wait in the line. It's worth it. Plus, they are very good at estimating the time you will wait - and they'll usually be quicker than they say.  The waiters are professional and service is fast. Food is great. I especially recommend the lamb chops - big, juicy lamb chops. Also good: the saganaki (the fried cheese everyone keeps talking about), the assorted dips, and the greek salad. I would prefer if they provided more pita bread instead of the italian-style bread (which is good, but doesn't taste as good with the Greek dips).  So, next time you are craving some good Greek food, skip the silent places, and wait in line at Mezes. You'll thank yourself."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Dishes are HUGE, good Greek/American restaurante. Probably not the best restaurant in Toronto but it's cheap, quick and something different."}
{"text":"I took my team here for a year-end holiday dinner.  There were nine of us.  We ordered a variety of dips, meats and vegetable dishes and shared them at the table.  It seemed like everyone was happy.  I thought the food was solid.  There were some dishes that didn't quite blow me away, but for the most part they were delicious.   Our server was very good.  He made some great recommendations on dishes, and was polite and friendly throughout the meal.  I was particularly impressed when it was time to pay the bill - he took care to tell me that a gratuity was already included, and refused to accept an additional tip, although I would have given more.  A nice guy who seemed to love his job.  Total cost was around $60 per person including wine, lots of dishes, etc.  The place was absolutely packed - every seat was full, on a Tuesday night.  There were no issues with our reservation."}
{"text":"A mixed review, the quail was completely underwhelming. We were a large party and all who ordered it said it was underwhelming. Accompanying salad was not well dressed and tasteless. Rice and potatoes were ok but nothing to write home about.   On the otherhand the lamb chops are delish. You can order them as an ap or as a main.   We were a large group so they tacked on a 17% service charge. But service was good."}
{"text":"Great garlic potato dip as the appetizer.    Beef slovakia was also really good. Price was decent and filling.   We went during the day so the place was pretty empty so little wait time for food."}
{"text":"I had the Zinis Rice Special for lunch. It was good amount of food. Very full after. The restaurant is clean, and service is great. However, it's a bit pricy."}
{"text":"This might be my go to on the Danforth now.  Large portions and amazing food! Service was awesome and helpful when we needed recos.   Will be back 100%"}
{"text":"Since I was in Greece on my honeymoon in May I haven't been able to find Greek food in Canada that compared to the fresh produce and delicious flavours served by restaurants on the islands... other than at Mezes on the Danforth. This is the most delicious restaurant in Greek Town, the service is fantastic and the ambiance is close to something you'd actually find in Greece!   We went on Friday night for dinner (with friends from out of town) and opted to share a whole bunch of small plates. We enjoyed a bottle of Greek Cab Sauv and a few Mythos beers, while tucking into plates of spanakopita, stuffed hot peppers, chicken souvlaki, greek salad, hummus, tzaziki, saganaki (OPA!) and lots and lots of fresh, warm pita!  Needless to say we were stuffed... but so, so happy!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the gyros are dry and not very good. This place was good many years ago but it's really disappointing these days. The wait and the price make it not worth it at all. There are other decent places in the area that I frequent due to this."}
{"text":"I'd put more than 5 stars for the service at Mezes! All the servers take care of each customer individually no matter how busy they are, you always feel welcome!   There's a line during weekend which is legit regarding the quality!   I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So this is def my fave Greek restaurant in Danforth..  Their dips (like I mentioned previously in Ouzeri) are delicious! You can get a combination of eggplant (like baba ghanoush), salmon roe, tzatziki, and humous with crispy pita bread.   Quick Greek lesson (for those that aren't too familiar):  Saganaki - Seared Kefalograviera Cheese Flambeed With Ouzo. (typically salty, but entertaining if you like to watch cheese get set on fire for a hot second)  Gigantes - Giant Lima Beans Baked Fresh Herbs, Vegetables And Tomatoes. (i'm a big fan of this)  Anyway, pretty much EVERYTHING I've tried here so far is good.   The restaurant setting is nice and the staff is family-friendly.  I come out here anytime I come up to Toronto with my family. It doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"A Greek friend of mine suggested this place and naturally, I trust his opinion, and he did not disappoint. I don't have much more to add that others haven't already said other than I love the fact that you can order lamb chops and chicken or pork souvlaki individually! At $3-4 each, I thought they were a great deal! I really enjoyed the quails too. The grilled octopus was some of the most tender that I've ever had and I would definitely recommend ordering it. Everything comes with tzatziki too so order some extra pita bread to eat it all up! They don't take reservations on Saturday evenings so definitely arrive early if you want to score a table. We arrived at 5:15 and didn't have trouble getting a table for 4, but by 5:30 the restaurant was pretty much completely packed. Service was consequently just so-so (they never refilled our water or came back for repeat drink orders). Overall, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a find. We were walking around Danforth looking for good eats. This place just looked right. We went in, and were lucky to be seated quickly.   The food was great, service was good, and the atmosphere was outstanding. For some reason I think of an old mafioso place where everyone is family and there is a genuine warmth of character (except during the assassination runs!).   I have eaten many times at 'nice' places in the SF Bay Area, and not one place compares to Mezes. All the high-end SF places have a tonne of annoying attitude with snooty waiters. I felt comfortable and at home at Mezes. It was like the movies!  Go there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times with my family because we wanted something Greek and were in the area. I really enjoy the food here and it is authentic Greek food. I like to think I know because I traveled throughout Greece one summer and thoroughly loved their food. The restaurant was packed when we got there but we did manage to snag a table for 6 people after waiting for 10 minutes which was freakin awesome!  I really enjoy the grilled kalamari. There's something about not frying these and then applying some balsamic vinagrette with fresh onions that really appeals to me. I also like the kalamari gemisto because the pairing of the squid with feta cheese is just very delicious.   My family never really likes an eggplant dip (baba ganoush per se) but I thoroughly enjoy the Melitzanosalata.  I usually get the lamb souvlaki because it's really really tender. The beef souvlaki is also pretty good and so is the pork souvlaki. My parents usually go for a fish dish and the red snapper that they got one time was absolutely fantastic that I had to get it the next time I went. That next time, it just wasn't as good as the first time but it was still delicious.  Mezes is one of the better greek restaurants in Toronto. The layout of the seating is really cramped in certain areas. If you get a seating with a booth in one end, getting out can sometimes be an issue. One time, the guy sitting behind me would sometimes bump his chair into mine when he moved around which was kind of annoying. I had to drop them a star for that but if not for the cramped quarters, this would probably get a 5."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining here this evening.  I met up with a gf, who was totally smart enough to make a reservation...and am I ever thankful we did.  It does get busy here, so it was really nice to be seated quickly.    We both ordered souvlaki, and it was delish!  I'm not a super big fan of greek salad normally, but here it was super good.  Just the right amount of feta, and not too salty (not sure how they managed that, but I'm not about to complain about it).  The service was pretty reasonable, our server was attentive, but not too pushy.  My DC mentioned that there were a lot of staff available to help, I personally didn't notice that, but my back was towards all the action, so I'll take her word for it.  The saganaki seemed to be a popular choice.  I love the drama of the whole experience, and was delighted that the table next to me decided to order it.  Overall it was a nice experience, and I will definitely be back...it's moved up the totem pole of my list of great greek restos in the city."}
{"text":"Craving for lamb chops!  I came here over the weekend with friends for the Taste of Danforth. They were one of the few stands that served lamb chops. I had a craving. Lamb chops ($4), shrimp skewers ($4), and the chicken skewers for $2.5. It was a steal!  I love lamb and I walked pretty darn far to find a stand that served lamb chops. They were extra tasty when you dipped them in Tzatziki sauce. The lamb chops were very juicy and flavorful. I love the smokiness too. If it wasn't for the long lineup... I may have gone inside for a sit down meal.  Great little find. I'd definitely go back to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"This was my first greek restuarant, and my first taste of Saganaki (flaming cheese). This is a very authentic restaurant with a good portion of food and a wide variety of greek food. I also like the skordalia (potato dip) and the chicken souvlaki is moist and tasty. I would give a heads up that these guys go heavily on the booze in a mixed drink, but sometimes its a good thing."}
{"text":"Food: I ordered 3 apps to snack on; stuffed potato, assorted pies, and saganaki.   Stuffed Potato: delicious.  Pies: good, but over salted.  Saganaki: never arrived.   So, food appears to be better than most but the service was pretty terrible.  It took quite a while to get an order in, then 2 items were missed. When we were done, we were left unnattended for 20 minutes.    I get the impression that I had an unusual experience and will try again."}
{"text":"Pre concert night out. Ordered appetizers only which came out quick. Nothing stood out as spectacular but we all felt we had a good dinner. Would like to try it again and have a full course meal."}
{"text":"BEST GREEK FOOD IN TORONTO! After spending three weeks in the Greek islands, Mezes is the closest to the real thing.  Loved it here and can say without a doubt that I would go again.  Service was a bit slow both times I went but it was packed so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Came here with a small group for a re-energizing lunch after a walking touring that ended at Woodbine Beach and Ashbridge's Bay. Wow, t'was a truly meze-style experience especially after the way the intricately patterned plates looked at our table. It's been a long time since I tried to appreciate eggplant but man, the fried eggplant with the yogurt(?) condiment was so light with a light crisp coating. And also one of my table-mates shared a taste of his meatballs. First bite into one was just describable! The centre didn't feel dense and meaty and it was such a different texture, the accompanying tomato sauce also added some zing to it. Each of us that tried one love it.  Also needing a notable mention was the Taramosalata that was included as part of their dip platter which included three others. This is the first time ever that I have tried this notable culinary pride of the Greeks and I loved it. The soft, creamy paste had a good balance of the red roe mixed it in it and the garlic pitas were also scrumptious that we order a second plate them so that we could clean up the other dips. The Spanakopitas also looked quaint in their triangular forms. The Saganaki was a treat to see being flambeed before it was placed at our table but it would have tasted really good if we had eaten it immediately. The service here was kind of interesting, like a subtle way of showing concern for the needs of the patrons. The was one notable thing that our Serve did for one member of the table and because it was a rather grey, cold Saturday afternoon. He suggested that he could pull the plastic sheets that cover parts of the patio so that the cold air did not get to us. And it was only then that I noticed that our table-mate had wrapped herself up with a shawl. That was a neat gesture on his part :-) It was definitely a feast for the eyes and our palettes. I would definitely return here sometime."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my friend.  It's a cute little place in the heart of Greek town.  The service was very friendly.    Greek food is one of my favourites, so it was heard to pick one thing!  The prices aren't too bad, and in fact I love how you can order lamb chops individually!  My friend is a vegetarian, so we ended up getting some dips, salad, spanikopita and I had a lamb chop.  I love being able to get a variety of food, but for a decent price and not make it seem like I'm ordering 2 different meals!  lol"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there on Saturday evening for supper, and even though it was a bit busy, after waiting less than ten minutes, we were seated. Our server was very friendly and helped us to choose from the menu. Its atmosphere was cozy and its decoration added to its homy sense. The food was generally good. I really liked the Greek salad with fresh lettuce and creamy feta which comes with all main food as a side. I enjoyed my Mousaka. My friends seemed happy with their food too. I was not a big fan of its rice though. To me, it was very moist. The price was reasonable, and I would say its plus point is for sure its service. All in all, I definitely suggest this place for those who crave for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite greek restaurants on the danforth - great grilled meat and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek restaurant in Toronto. The calamari is unmatched with any other restaurant that I've seen (never stringy and horrible like it usually is) and even more delicious when accompanied with their creamy tzatiki sauce.  The chicken kleftiko is an invention that I never knew of until I went there. Its a chicken breast with tomato, feta and spinach wrapped in filo and its quite a treat.  Also I would strongly recommend the spanikopita and the beet pies which are individually cooked to order and much much better than any other spanikopita that you might eat at a bakery that's been sitting around."}
{"text":"Lovely, family style, unpretencious, always kind, good, real, to the heart, place. Hits the spot and does it well. In its genre and within its greek town simplicity, it is a nice gem."}
{"text":"This is one of the Top 5 Greek restaurants on the Danforth (the others being Pantheon, Pan, Ouzeri and Messini's).  The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great, though a bit cramped.  Unlike Pantheon, the inside is very modern, renovated and tastefully done.  'Mezes' means 'small dish' or appetizer in Greece (and the entire Balkans), alike the Spanish Tapas.  We usually order a bunch of Mezes dishes here and ignore the 'mains' although they are good as well.  The Gigantes beans are one of the most amazing vegetarian dishes you can try.  The Taramosalata is not from a can and doesn't taste sour like in other Greek places on the Danforth, but is very tasty and filling.  The individual souvlaki sticks are a very good deal and come with a side of thick Greek yoghurt which goes amazingly with the meat (that's how we eat it back home).  Overall an amazing authentic experience, none of the north-americanization of Greek food."}
{"text":"Outstanding location in Greektown on the Danforth. We ordered the fried squid and the grilled squid and they were both great. Although we don't often order dessert, we split the Galaktoboureko and it also was very good.  Great ambiance, we were surrounded by a number of Greek-speaking customers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Mezes is an ideal location for a relatively small group. 4-6 people is a good number because you can order various dishes from the mezes menu and taste everything.  MUST TRY: - Grilled Kalamari - Garides Rodou (shrimps with tomato and feta sauce)  Recommended: - Kria Poikilia (Dip platter) - Saganaki (flambeed cheese) - Lamb Chops - Dolmades - Kalamari Gemisto (good, but not an improvement on the grilled version)  (I haven't tried any of the pites. Athens pastries is so good that I'm scared to compare.)  I was not particularly impressed with the octopus. Not that it's bad.  Service has been solid, but it's based on a small sample size.  The dishes are fairly expensive. But it still compares favorably to something like Tapas, where the portion sizes are smaller.  Also, I recommend ordering things piecemeal... start with the dip platter and Grilled Kalamari. Then order more, working your way up to the heavier platters. That way the food comes out continuously but at a slow pace. You end up eating less and enjoying the food and the experience more.  Also, if you really love a particular dish, you can order another one before you're full.  It's a good idea to call ahead for reservations."}
{"text":"Mezes is a Greektown institution.  It's been here for quite sometime. it is one of our regular Greektown haunts.  They actually do the \"mezes\" thing pretty well.  Think greek tapas.  What do they do well: - Fried Calamari appetizer -- it's generous, and very light on the batter -- and cooked just right - Horatiki salad -- fresh and love the feta - Hummous with pita -- it's not the really smooth style, more coarse, it's great! - Souvlaki - they do great souvlaki here -- as a pita sandwich or a platter - French Fries - ok -- I know this might sound strange but this is one thing they also do very well.  They are like what my mom used to make from scratch.  They are standard cut, fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside and hot when they come to your table.  Best on the Danforth  Service is always friendly and timely.  They have a nice little patio in the front.  They have lots of other great items on the menu including a combo mezes appetizer platter with 4 dips that we have had in the past.  Anyways -- it's a good spot on the Danforth and they always seem busy so lots of other folks must agree!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the city served by friendly and funny waiters. You can't go wrong. This is a good place to take out-of-town friends who want to experience something unique. Definitely get the saganaki and the dip platter."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times.  First time it was a quieter night and was there for a birthday.  The food was really good, and we looked forward to going back.  The second time we went it was on a weekend and busier. The food was a bit lack-luster this time.    so good food, but not consistent."}
{"text":"Wow!! Their platter is yummy and great quality. Huge portions for everything. Everything is very very yummy!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Sunday with a few friends.  Everything was fine, but nothing knocked my socks off...well except for one item but I'll get to that.    We started with the dip sampler, which was ok...I found most of the dips to pretty bland and I could buy better at the grocery store.  We also had the fried cheese (I'm forgetting its proper name- but its the one where they douse it in brandy and yell OPA! while serving to you).  This was quite tasty and apparently the best thing on the menu because I'm pretty sure every single other patron also ordered this.    I had the chicken souvlaki pita as my meal.  It was ok...a little on the dry and flavorless side.    I ordered the custard topped with phyllo dough for desert (again- I'm forgetting its proper name) which was completey flavorless and boring.  The servers were really nice and friendly and there was definitely nothing bad about the meal but I can't say it was even close to the best greek food I've ever had."}
{"text":"First time stopping by just a short time ago and it was packed!  That seemed like a good sign.   Glancing at the menu, there was enough food on the menu that wasn't \"souvlaki\" for us to consider it out of the realm of Greek fast food. We started with the pitas and dip, straightforward and hard to mess up, which they didn't.  That lasted just long enough to order our mains, we just couldn't decide. I had whatever you call chicken breast wrapped in filo with cheese and some veggies.  It was quite good on it's own, but hit it with some fresh lemon juice and bam(!) - flavour country. My wife had the kalamari dinner.  I thought it was cooked properly, but not my cup of tea. The only thing I was bummed out about was the side \"greek\" salad was just iceberg, feta, a couple veggies and olive oil.  I wanted some chunks of peppers, onions, cucumbers etc for my \"Greek\" salad.  And I know they have it, since the people next to us had ordered it.  Oh well, I'll just have the deliciousness of the rest of the meal to go on. Saying that, Mezes get high marks from me.  I will gladly return."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.    It's neither cheap, nor expensive.  It rides the line of affordable Greek food in the Danforth.  Of all the places I've been, it's been one of the most memorable.  The staff was very welcoming, and was able to put together a large reservation (more than a dozen people.)  The waiter was chatty, but not overly so - to the point of just wanting to eat your meal.  There was a very warm environment here, which paired will with the delicious meal."}
{"text":"Really good Greek food. Good value and had some good Cypriot beer."}
{"text":"We were originally going to eat Ethiopian food but decided on a whim that we would try Greektown in stead. Frommer's lead us here and we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was pretty crowded when we showed up at 10 on the Sunday of labor day weekend, but we were able to get the last two top immediately.  Our goal was to try as much as possible so we stuck entirely to the mezes. For the two of us we ordered a large dip platter that also came with pickled octopus, the pites combo platter, roasted beets and two individual lamb chops. We had way too much food and could have ordered a lot less, but enjoyed the meal.   Kria Poikilia (dip platter) - We got the large size because I really wanted to order the octapodi toursi and it seemed just as easy, and cheaper, to have it as an add on to the platter. It was way too much food for two people and we left about half of the dips on the plate. In particular we weren't huge fans of the taramosalata. I probably wouldn't order this unless you had a large group, 4 or more. I enjoyed the octopus a lot, it was like an octopus civiche. A full order, however, would have been way too much for the two of us.   Assored Pites - Came with a spanakopita, tirokafteropita and a pantzaropita. The spanakopita was still my favorite, and it was definitely delicious. I'd never had a tirokafteropita (leek and beat filled puff pastry) but I quite enjoyed it. It was definitely not as sweet as I expected, with the leeks being much more prevalent than the beats.  Pantzaria - Baked beets infused with wine vinegar and garlic. Again, not as sweet as we expected, but tasty. It came with chopped raw, or almost raw onion. We didn't even eat most of this because we were stuffed by the time we got it. It definitely is only for the beet loving crowd (that would be us) and was closer to pickled beets then roasted. We probably wouldn't order it again, but it was enjoyable.  Lamb chops - the lamb chops are served a la carte and were delicious. They were incredibly fatty, however, so if you want your meat lean this is not the way to go.   Service was friendly, though at times it was busy. Atmosphere was festive and fun without being super dressy or pretentious. We will definitely come back, hopefully with reinforcements because this place would definitely be more fun with 4 or 6 people."}
{"text":"Mezes continues to pack the room! Wow! A Thursday night with a significant line at 8pm, but food and service yotally worth the wait. We had exclusively mezes (Greek tapas): tsatziki, spanakopita, kalamari (grilled), dolmades, souvlaki, etc. The mezes are generous and scrumptious. We paired it with Greek Mythos brand lager beer. Scoring a table on their sidewalk covered patio was the cherry on top. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best you can get on the danforth. I have been to this restaurant more times than I can remember and its very consistent. Tip:  drink retsina with Greek food."}
{"text":"We had lunch outside on the patio,nice day for people watching, service was swift. Fried calamari was pretty good, Lamb and chicken souvalaki was moist nd tender,"}
{"text":"VIBE  This is one of the most popular Greek restaurants on The Danforth and whether you like it or not, there's always a line up to get a table, especially on a weekend. Expect to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday night. That said, the hostess does try to seat you as quickly as possible.  I last went here in August, 2011 and the vibe is very casual. Usually, someone is having a family meal, a birthday party or a group dinner here. It is a good date place though. In fact, the vibe is so casual that I saw a guy come in on a date adorned by two HOCKEY STICKS. WHO BRINGS A HOCKEY STICK ON A DATE? Most Canadian thing I've ever seen. It was quite hilarious. Moving along...  WE ATE  We were pretty starving so we had the bread that they bring out (note:  don't come here if you're on the Zone diet. Greeks can't part with their carbs) and then we had the taramousalata, the fish roe caviar dip that is pink. I love this stuff and they make a very large portion that's creamy pink fish roey goodness.  We were able to substitute our iceberg lettuce salads with the greek village salad (no iceberg but green pepper, kalamata olives, cucumber , tomato and plenty of feta) and though it was $2 extra, wroth the cost (I hate that they do this but it's life). Our mains were the chicken souvlaki dinner and the lamb souvlaki dinner. The souvlaki portions huge and juicy and not dry unlike Mr. Greek's version. Served with rice, we were stuffed.  As others have said, Mezes is not cheap (and I think they have raised their prices over the years). With two glasses of wine each, our meal came to $100. I won't go there for a while, but it was a great meal and I highly recommend it. This on my top three Greek restaurants list in the city (and I live in the Danforth area, so am familiar with the other options).   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Mezes is Greek for appetizer. Pick a little. Take a little. One Greek restaurant to appetize your senses."}
{"text":"i went to greece a few years ago and was blown away by the food.  this isn't quite like going, but imho it's as close as you'll get in toronto.    usually friendly service.  nearly always packed."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The specialty liquor from Greece that is mixed with lemonade and isn't ouzo is great. Order that!  Chicken souvlaki is delicious. Greek salad is delicious. Everything is good, solid Greek food.  I'll be back when I want Greek food again."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. We just ordered some wine and apps for sharing and left feeling very happy.  The Dip Platter was amazing! Also the saganaki was to die for! (and very impressive to see it lit on fire) Service was fantastic and overall, pretty good value for money. Loved the feeling of the place and am already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I liked the appetizer hummus, eggplant, and tahini dips. Super garlicky and delicious. The Dolmades were good,  but too salty for me. Actually, all of the food seemed a bit salt-heavy for my palate. I had the fried calamari, which was good, but not as fried as I'd hoped. If you want lightly fried,   Portions are huge and service is excellent!"}
{"text":"After visiting top Greek restaurants in Portland, Philadelphia and Vancouver, I am happy to say that I've finally found one that deserves a 5/5. I came across this restaurant after vigorously searching for the best restaurant on the Danforth. I was torn between two establishments but ended up choosing this one as it was more suitable for dinner.  Nuts and Bolts: Waiter - George Night - Tuesday Group - 3  Originally this was going to be a reservation for six but we had three people cancel because of the flu. The staff at the restaurant easily switched our tables. We were seated on the elevated floor and the restaurant was at capacity. Noise level was moderate.  I try to judge the quality of a foreign-cuisine restaurant by what I feel is there \"staple\" dish. With a Greek restaurant I always go with the Lamb Souvlaki, and at Mezes I was not disappointed. Upon being asked how I would like my souvlaki cooked, I was briefly taken aback. I'm used to being asked this question but this was the first time I had been asked at a Greek one. I ordered it Medium.  Our meal arrived in a timely manner. I must say that the portion sizes are generous compared to other Greek restaurants I've been to. I could not finish the tzatziki sauce! It was the perfect complement to my decadent lamb. The salad was on a plate on its own. I did not order an appetizer and in hindsight I feel that this is the way to go because the entree is so large.   For desert our table decided to share the baked phillo dough drenched in syrup. I cannot recall the name of the dish but it was delightful.   Through it all, George (our waiter) was en pointe. He was charming, comedic and timely. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are anywhere near the Danforth. I will surely return in the summer."}
{"text":"The stretch of Danforth Avenue that makes up Toronto's Greektown straddles the line between faux-ethnic tourist trap and living neighbourhood. Emerging from Pape subway station in the middle of the neighbourhood, you're assaulted by a row of restaurants, cafés, dodgy clothing stores and specialty markets. There are also massive social halls, churches, and professional buildings, all in various states of repair.  Mezes is a fixture of the strip, and with good reason. The room is big and clean; tables placed just far enough to be comfortable, while close enough for you to ask the diners next door \"what is that you're eating\". And you will, because the food is fabulous.   A piece of advice: even though the sesame-studded baguette is fresh, skip it an save room. Start with the dip platter. The small sees four mounds of Meditteranean mush sided with warm, crisp, quartered Greek pita...and unlike the puffy store-bought versions, these flatbreads are delightfully thin; perfect vehicles for piquantly pink taramosalata, creamy-smoky eggplant, soon-to-be-omnipresent tzaziki, and hummus, which really doesn't belong in a Greek restaurant, but it's tasty so we'll give it a pass.   A massive plate of fried calamari arrives, sided with more tzaziki and a wedge of lemon. It's more than enough for three hungry people. The squid is cooked perfectly, flash fried just to silkiness; the batter is crisp. The tzaziki is a perfect foil for the first few blisteringly-hot mouthfuls, but it's reappearance throughout the meal generates yogurt fatigue.   From there, dishes arrive fast and furious; hot banana peppers stuffed with tomato and more cheese push the boundaries of my spice tolerance (tzaziki to the rescue!). Keftedes (which are meatballs, but that's like calling a croque monsieur a grilled cheese sandwich) come with a smokey, complex tomato sauce that would also suit the aforementioned calamari. Fried zucchini topped with cheese allow us to fool ourselves into thinking we're eating healthy. We decimate the plate.   Horitaki (Greek \"Village\" salad, made without lettuce) is slicked with fine olive oil. It boasts ripe olives and feta that registers as somehow both crumbly and creamy. It's too late for tomatoes, though. They're insipid, but the red onions are crisp and sweet.   The final dish is a small school of large-ish shrimp, baked in a saltier and brinier tomato-based sauce, sprinkled with cheese. By this time we're stuffed, and the shrimp barely registers except for overcooking. The sauce, however, makes hypocrites of us all. We dive into the bread basket to sop it up.   A limited but sufficient selection of beer and wine are available. Percolated coffee, as David letterman would say, is \"useless, warm brown water\". Greek coffee (finely ground and strongly brewed with a heap of sugar) is a tastier, jazzier option. A small piece of chocolate baklava takes us through the rabbit hole on a massive sugar high."}
{"text":"Best Greek food on the Danforth!   Try the saganaki for sure!"}
{"text":"We went to Mezes for dinner last night and could not be happier with our choice of venue. We waited less than 10 min to get a table on the patio. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was absolutely delicious. I guess I never really tried proper greek food opting for cheaper places in the past. This experience has changed my appreciation for authentic Greek food. The dips and the seafood I tried were absolutely irresistible. The calamari were freshly fried with rice and a salad sprinkled with feta bits. After my meal, I felt full, yet not heavy in my stomach like I sometimes feel after eating animal products. All in all, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. With an average entree price of $20-$23, you bill will likely be around $50-$60 +tax with drinks for 2 people."}
{"text":"A new fav on the Danforth! (Thank you big tall Greek boy for the recommendation!)  The food quality here is amazing. Today I met the girls for lunch and we shared a few things. The gigantes beans were delicious, even better than most of the ones I had when traveling in Greece last month. The tappenade here was ridiculous too. I was oogling food on the other tables and it also looked awesome.   Price point was a little higher than others on the Danforth, but given food quality and authenticity it's worth the extra few $$. The menu has a lot of good treats that cannot be found at many other places on the Danforth (yum, GIGANTES!)  Service was fast and efficient, but not as friendly as the folks at Pantheon. Oh well :)  Decor is okay. Not a traditional taverna style (Pantheon, Athens restaurant) nor a date/romanticy place (Ouzeri, Pan) but somewhere in between the two.   Nice plates, too beautiful to smash."}
{"text":"Dinner around 7pm, 2 guests including myself.  We each ordered two appetizers (4)...how many showed up? 3. Maybe if the waiter took time to write orders down, we wouldn't have been sitting there waiting for our next plate while he passed by and gave us dirty looks.  Dip platter (small) very good, I just wish it came with more pitas. As another user mentioned it was a little salty, but still good.  The dolmades were disgusting. I don't know how they're supposed to taste but 1. I couldn't taste the meat, so right off what's the point of paying that price? 2. all I could taste was the bitter lemon sauce. I ate a quarter of the dish and wasn't asked if everything was okay. It made me nauseous. Maybe it's an acquired taste.  My friend had the cheese on bread thing. She enjoyed that thoroughly.  We didn't get our trio of pies and that was what I was most looking forward to.  The atmosphere was pretentious, and from what I experience they have very little right to be. Don't just work on the deco coming into the restaurant, work on it all. I don't want to sit next to a statue of a cat with one eye missing while I eat. I don't want to sit at a table that I could barely get into because the chair cannot be pulled out. I don't think you can even call it a table if it can't hold three apps."}
{"text":"With the many restaurants on the Danforth, this place is always busy at prime hours and it has always left me scratching my head. So one day I tried it out and left completely unimpressed. Usually when a place is packed there is something special about it, but obviously I'm the exception here. After reading other reviews on this restaurant maybe I didn't approach it the right way. It seems the best way to enjoy the place is to order and share a bunch of different plates. I went to my staple chicken souvlaki and my wife had some sort of meatloaf style meal. I didn't have any complaints about the food (although my wife didn't really like the meatloaf as she thought it was very salty), and the service was fine. I do believe they had a good selection on wines, but I'm not a wine drinker so I didn't get the benefit of this.  The reason why I would choose other restaurants over this one is for 2 reasons 1) the tables are set way to close together, and its almost like you are eating with strangers 2) they charge for extra tzatziki (this irks me)  People generally seem to have a good time at this place, but my Greek dining structure is not suited for this place."}
{"text":"Went to Mezes tonight after getting a few recommendations from some Greek friends. The service was slow and the restaurant was hot (needed to blow some more AC) but the food was worth the wait.   We started with the 4 dip appetizer which I would give a 3.5/5. The tzitziki was outstanding but the other other three dips were just okay, with the eggplant dip having a weird banana-ish taste to it.   For my main, I had the classic chicken souvlaki which was juicy and moist and came with greek potatoes, rice and a salad. The salad had a little too much dressing for my liking and should have been brought out earlier as an appetizer while we waited for our mains, as it came out with our entrees. I had a bite of my friend's lamb souvlaki which also tasted really good!  We were way too full to have any dessert. I would come back again but maybe not on such a hot day!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times with my good friend from Toronto and finally had to drag my husband here on our last visit.  It was a bit of an adventure to get there on the subway from downtown but we found it without a problem.  The food is SO good and I love the atmosphere of the restaurant.  We were there for lunch so started with Greek salads and then shared the Kria Poikilia, which is 4 delicious dips served with pita.  We both love homous and Tzatziki but we had to ask our server about the pinkish dip that was amazingly good.  It was Taramosalata, cod roe, potatoes and olive oil I think.   A few glasses of white wine made for a perfect lunch on the Danforth.  Now I have to get him back there for dinner!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 5 hungry people. Everyone agreed on eating here after wondering around the Danforth. We did not have reservations but I would recommend them. We waited about 20 minutes before being seated.  The staff was super friendly.  We ordered Mezes of rodos (Huge seafood platter!) I ate most of the octopus and lots of calamari. I must say this platter was so filling for the four of us. Our drinks were filled regularly. Great service.  We also ordered a lamb souvlaki dinner for one of the people in the group who was not crazy about seafood.  I must say all the food was just excellent. Service was excellent.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It was very busy. Large groups/couples/guys/gals/ and everyone looked happy.  I would have rated this a 5 star until my visit to the ladies room. It had not been clean in quite sometime. I was kind of shocked.   Will I be back? YUP!"}
{"text":"Vegetable moussaka was not fresh. Looked and tasted like it had been warmed up, dry. $20. Salad was fresh and  great. No refill on coffee."}
{"text":"Service!! I need Service!!  I have no idea why the host kept seating me in a section with just 1 waiter working a table of 12, two tables of 3 and 1 table of 2... while one waiter only has 1 table in his section?  Waiting Waiting even for a glass of water and acknowledging from the waiter that I exist was just frustrating!! I just want something simple and fast!! I just want my order to go in BEFORE that party of 12...  Chicken Souvlaki on Pita ($8.95) with a Side Salad ($2.95) - Grilled Chicken goes well with the tzatziki - Pita bread is warm and has a little crispy to it - salad is quite standard but at least is fresh   Mezes does have good atmosphere, especially with all these tables ordering Saganaki, OPA!  Seems like everyone is fighting to sit on that smallish patios... the inside of the restaurant does get a little stuffy and hot with all this flaming cheese and grilling going on!"}
{"text":"The waiter (older man with crown balding) was rude and wanted us off the patio.  My friend and I had a drink and took our time to order our meals or more drinks. Such poor customer service. I'd definetely avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Was soooooo good!!! Got the chicken Slouvaki dinner and substituted the potato for the veggies. was sooo much food! The Greek salad it came with was a meal on it's own! My only complaint is that while the dressing on the salad was good, it was drenched in it - I should have asked for it On the side. will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and food quality is always great expect for our recent visit this past Monday. The food quality seems to have dropped and the waiter didn't even come back to ask us if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"This home style quaint restaurant is a hidden Greek jewel in the city with the most welcoming staff and always fresh delicious Greek good ! It is the only place in the city that will accommodate all your needs with a smile on their face ; however challenging your requests are.  I have been coming here for years and am delighted to enjoy traditional Greek delicacies in authentic Greek atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were here with a large group of friends for lunch on a thursday before new years.  The place was really nice inside, more of a romantic place to have dinner rather than lunch with friends, though.  The service was decent in speed and the waiters were very nice.  The cheapest thing on the menu were the lunch souvlakis.  I got the chicken souvlaki on pita with salad.  The portion size was decent and the flavours were amazing, the only thing was that the chicken tasted really dry.  The group also got some saganaki (which is flaming cheese!  It's really just for the experience.)  The cheese was tasty, but a bit too salty.  The portion size was good though, since we couldn't finish it.  Overall I would go back, but for dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dips and the flavours of the fish are amazing. I'm still learning about Greek wines but I was able to find one similar to Pino Grigio that was really refreshing"}
{"text":"Flaming cheese really saves this place. Who doesn't love flaming cheese from a Greek guy?  I came here with a couple of Yelp buds after drinking too much beer and spitting too much trivia down the block at an Elite Event. I had the flaming cheese (like I said, can't go wrong) and the pork souvlaki. The pork was overdone and no better than any fast food Greek food I've had previously, and obviously much more pricey.  But still, the cornucopia of strange Greek decor + the flaming cheese makes Mezes A-OK by my standards.  PEPPER PROPS: To Kent P and Brendan C for being so darn cool.   25/30"}
