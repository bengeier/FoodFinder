{"text":"Food is decent. The customer service is atrocious.  The female owner is ignorant. She yelled and swore when I called about a catering order that was incorrect."}
{"text":"They have really delicious italian food. All of their pasta dishes are great and taste authentic. Pasta gone bananas and the chicken parm are two of my favorites! You also get a good sized salad and a roll with the dinners. Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It has the best Chicken Romano ever. You need to try it."}
{"text":"Just got our first pizza from Banana Peppers and it's seriously the best we have found in the area! Absolutely love it. I also recommend the cheesy breadsticks. Very friendly too!"}
{"text":"I had nice meal here. The price is fair. The pizza was good. There is no sit down dining but there is carry out and delivery. I will eat here again. It is a million times better than the Italian village which is the other pizza place in the area."}
