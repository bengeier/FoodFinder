{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!! They spit in my food...can u imagine? DO NOT TRUST! The old guy in combination is lethal! I don't know if he's the owner, but very unfriendly and revenge oriented..."}
{"text":"Brought my kids to this hero burger and was greatly disappointed!  Though on the menu it advertises a kids menu, when I asked, the manager said that there isn't.  Forced to order from adult menu, which is significantly more expensive.  Then I had a coupon for a free sundae (for every combo purchased), again I was told no and oh that the sundae machine is broken anyway.  How convenient!! First and LAST time at hero burger. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The food and the workers were taribble. The cooker ate fries while he was cooking. The servers and the cooks never washed thier hands. The server was sucking on her finger and talking directly at the food , which put spit on my food. The cook cooked with the hand that he just used to sweep. The fries were very oily and theburger taste stale. Never ever go to Hero Burger at major mac. They are terrible."}
{"text":"It's a Hero Burger - nuff said.   The interior is not the cleanest, but the food is good, the owners are friendly and there is always place to sit down.   If you are in the area, and you feel like having a burger, there aren't any alternatives.   Might repeat, if the need arises."}
{"text":"The service was kind and friendly, however the food was not what I was expecting. The burgers was foamy and dry, and had no flavour whatsoever. For the price I paid ($15), I was thoroughly disappointed. Would have rather gone to Wendy's or McDonalds."}
