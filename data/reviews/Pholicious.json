{"text":"I hate to give this place 1 star but my recent experiences were horrible. I use to dine at this restaurant often with my family. The more we go, service decreased. Our water cups never get filled.

The very last time I was there, I found a gnat in my pho. Although I have eaten about 50% of the medicore pho, they asked if I wanted another bowl. I said no; I was there on my lunch break. No time to wait for another bowl. I got up to pay for my bill and to my surprise, there was no discount or any sort of accommodation. 

I am disappointed with them and will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and fast friendly service.  The number 55 was awesome!  Decent prices and a nice atmosphere.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was delightful. I've only had pho a few times in my life but this place did not disappoint. I had read several reviews about this place saying 'the decor was mundane, etc' yet I thought it was very nice. It was about what I expected. Clean. Tastefully decorated. The staff was kind and stopped by the table several times to see if we needed anything. 

I ordered the beef pho and it was delightful. I plan to branch out next time I visit."}
{"text":"Pho broth is not the best and the meat is too tough! Staff is nice but We won't go back."}
{"text":"The food is always great and fesh. Our family have dinner here every weekend. My favorite one is beef PHO. Most the staffs are nice and polite. The funny story is when I saw there was a rude family , they did not eat there but they sat the baby on the restaurant's table, seems like they about to feed the baby or change the diaper the server was nice to ask what would they like but they pissed off and yelled out loud LMAO"}
{"text":"I love this place for Pho. I generally dont order anything else because the food is average. However, the noodle soups, Pho, is awesome. 

One must take advantage of the extra ingredients and the sauces to make the soup \"snap\"! Otherwise, first timers may think the soup is bland."}
{"text":"My favorite dish here would be pho Dac biet n the beef rice plate, customers service is great, they have new owner now so I don't go as much n I don't tip because the owner keep the tip which is wrong. I like the old owner better so even though is close to my house I won't be going here much."}
{"text":"I went in here for a quick smoothie and I have mixed feelings about this place! I came in and notice the place was slightly dirty, so I ordered my pineapple smoothie and it took a pretty long time to get! The blender was really loud!!!! When I got my smoothie and left I soon returned because there were little hot balls of something in my drink. When I went to them and asked them what it was they said it was boba? They gladly redid my order to what I wanted. I wouldn't want to come again though."}
{"text":"I've tried pretty much all the Vietnamese from all over the valley. Spending so much time in Cali and with my Asian friends spoiled me and it's hard to find a decent Pho spot that makes it right.

Everyone who has been to the spots in Tempe knows that it's always watered down and has no flavor. Pholicious seems to get it right.

It's very much a mom and pop spot, you come in seat yourself. The staff is always friendly and the place is clean.

The menu has something for everyone, but I'm always going to recommend the Pho with oxtail to anyone who asks. Prices are affordable and if you aren't info Pho, they have all the traditional dishes you'd expect.

They added a yogurt shop to it a few months ago so you can always try that if you're not into Boba or any of the traditional deserts."}
{"text":"Do not go to Pholicious.  The food is tasteless and completely overdone.  Their cleanliness standards are not up to par (i.e. pest control).  The service was among the slowest I've received in a long time.  A loud video game theme song played throughout my meal. Random and annoying. 

The wait staff and management are very courteous, but this does not justify wasting your money on Pholicious."}
{"text":"This place went from being my favorite Pho place to my least. The last 2 times I've ordered from here my food has been gross. First, dirty vegetables. Second, cold broth. It seems like the kitchen staff just doesn't care anymore!"}
{"text":"I am not one of those phonnoisseurs, but I do know a decent plate of Lemongrass Tofu, and this was GOOD.  My eyes rolled toward the heavens every time I took a bite. It had spice. It had red peppers too.

I also ordered the vegetarian spring rolls, which came with a yummy peanut sauce.

The place was clean and we were ushered to a booth- yay!

The service was fast, even though we did get the very last booth.

The decor was a bit over the top but eh whatev. At least it wasn't pretentious. I'd much rather think something is cute, even quaint, than have to look at that naked atrocity some dumbass calls art at *arly's."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever."}
{"text":"Mall food is usually sub-par, however Southpark Mall seems to have above-average food venues. Pholicious only reinforces this trend.

I don't want to write a drawn out review, so I'll just mention that their menu is very simple. Pho dishes with a variety of proteins (beef, chicken, shrimp, fish) that come in \"regular\" and \"large\" sizes, prices varying from $6.50-8.50. They have a few appetizers in the form of spring/egg rolls. They also have bubble tea. That's pretty much it. 

Their food is very good, the broth excellent. The pho comes with all the usual staples that you can opt to throw in (bean sprout, onion, lime slice, chili peppers), as well as sriracha sauce and hoison sauce.

I mean, that's basically it. But it's very GOOD, and very DIFFERENT.

I'd give them a 5-star but I'll wait until trying their bubble tea, spring rolls, and other protein options. As is, everything I've tried so far has been indicative of a 5-star rating, though."}
{"text":"This is not the best Pho in town. It is at best just alright. The service is some of the worst I've seen. They rush you to put in your order. You are served a glass of water and good luck getting anything else to drink. I ordered pork fried rice and never got it. When it was time to pay the pork fried rice was on my bill. The guy was very rude when I told him I never got my rice and wasn't paying for it. Don't waste your money in this place."}
{"text":"First visit here and I'll be back for more.

The Good:

Rich tasting Pho soup, did not have a greasy taste like. 
Fast/friendly service and very polite people.
Food was exceptional and fresh.
Price was just about right.
Interesting layout inside, especially the ceiling, pretty cool design
Clean Restaurant and professional looking.
Owner/s speak \"fluent english\" and reason im bringing this up is because other Pho restaurants I been to, I have come across non english waiters serving my food.

The Bad: (can be improved)

We did not recieve a refill or was asked. 
Did not come to our table as needed after meal and drinks was served.
After our check was brought, we were not asked if we needed anything else.
We were given very small amounts of stem of basil and 2 pieces of small lemons.

All in all, we had a fun experience here and the food was good.

I had the (Sua Dau Xanh) - MungBean Milk Beverage, it was okay.

Will try (Sinh To) milk shake next time."}
{"text":"So delicious. Definitely coming back. Great food, great prices, great atmosphere. I have nothing to complain about except that I don't have a bigger stomach."}
{"text":"We've ate at almost every pho restaurant in town and this was by far the worst. We both ordered the flank steak and brisket pho. The meat looked like a part of a stomach, it was so suspect we picked it out and asked for more brisket to replace it. Don't order the \"flank\" or whatever they're calling that meat. It's horrifying to me that they are even feeding that to people. I am uploading the pic we snapped of the meat, it's the yellowish brown pile of crap."}
{"text":"Weird space.  Small.  Cramped.  Sloppy on the inside.  Odd heating elements on floor to heat things.  This looks less like a franchise and more like someone set up a restaurant in a hurry and without an actual plan.  Drink machine is broken.  When I first looked at the broth as I sat to eat it, my first thought was that that it looked like old dish water, a sentiment echoed by my wife when she saw it.  Taste was a bit bland.  Lime was not great looking, but sprouts and cilantro were fine.  I didn't finish it.  It's mall food, true, but it's like they don't really care."}
{"text":"Worst viet food ever. Don't even think it needs to be labeled \"Vietnamese\". Pho is very pricey and no flavor at all. I came in and order spring rolls and egg rolls and was disappointed. Worst I've ever had. The viet sub they had was a big fail too. Let's just say, save your money and time and drive down the road to Saigon bay for some real viet food that's worth your money!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to do these kinds of reviews, however, I felt the need to tell everyone my experience in this restaurant. Let's just say it was horrible. I ordered the shrimp pho and it tasted so plain and shrimp fixing taste like shrimp and the rest of the soup was so plain. You could really taste the water. I also ordered some Fried rolls and they didn't have much flavor. I went to the bathrooms and the floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 5 weeks. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I ordered some to go beef pho from here. When I got home and opened the boxes I saw that they put the raw beef with all the fixings (sprouts, onions, rice noodles, etc.), and I was skeptical at first. I quickly added the beef to the broth to \"cook\" it, along with the rest of the ingredients. I ended up with some really delicious pho. I was very pleased. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in at noon on a Sunday when it opened.  I was told it would take about ten minutes for the broth for the Pho to be ready. Ten minutes later I was told another 15 minutes.  We didn't  get our food until 12:40.  It's in the food court and they need to have it ready when it opens.  Most other food court places open at 11am.  The chicken in the PHO tasted like frozen microwave chicken pieces. The broth tasted fine. The herb bags had more stems and less herbs.  Missing the Thai basil."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile so we decided to come here tonight and I must say, it was delicious! They give you just the perfect amount of food. We will definitely be back. Everyone is so nice and friendly. Very good customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast, friendly service and great prices. If you want to try a new place, pick this one. The menu has a large selection and the staff is willing to explain any menu item that you have not tried before. They are even willing to give chop-stick training to you! (I still failed!).

They deliver, but it's a great place to relax and enjoy great food in a friendly atompshere.  Very clean also. 

Try the beef, ribs and/or egg rolls. The rice is the best. I recommend taking a group and getting a ton of different items and trying them all."}
{"text":"Second time here. Was here for the first time before I moved here a week ago and ordered takeout. Was pretty good at that time and decided to come back after moving to AZ and living closeby.

Place is clean and large.

Pho was good, Broth was rich, somewhat slim on the meat-side but pretty-much on-par with most pho places I've been to all around the country and Canada. Overall for pho, a place I'd go back to, meets all expectations but doesn't exceed them anywhere, which is fine by me. I'm just happy this place is close to my home and I can go whenever I want, and its good food."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever to eat at. I wanted a bubble tea with coconut and taro mix together but the manger said I couldn't but I could mix strawberry and mango. Like wtf? You won't let me mix coconut and taro but your going to let me mix strawberry and mango. So I decided to get coconut and let me tell you, it was the worst bubble tea I've ever had. It tasted really plain with no flavor and it wasn't even a smoothie, it tasted more like ice and it wasn't blended really well. I was going to order pho but Realize the price for their pho is already the price of a regular size bowl of pho at the restaurant. I place an order for egg rolls and it took longer then it was suppose to be. I am really disappointed and I will not come back to this place. Also, what manger is going to talk on the phone in front of their customers while standing at the cash register. Did I mention, they don't serve egg roll sauce, instead he gave me duck sauce."}
{"text":"We have stopped coming to Pholicious since the last time we came in I received super oily chicken pho (I uploaded a pic). It was difficult to eat,  and whereas I usually drink a good portion of the broth after I finish the noodles, I couldn't stand it this time. It seems like there's different staff every time we come in as well. The rolls and other items we order are still really good, but you can't call yourself Pholicious if your pho sucks. What a shame."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in the west valley!  Price is right too, and the owner and young servers are friendly.  Try number 52 for a special treat.  Includes beef,shrimp,egg roll, noodles and salad greens and sprouts with a dipping sauce. 
 Even served  cleverly in a boat.  Lots of flavor, very fresh....and we are picky."}
{"text":"I have eaten here once when they had just opened. I was in the mood for a rice dish, so I ordered the combination rice plate. Dissappointly, they brought it out late considering nobody was there except me. And to make it worse, the food was cold!???meats were'nt marinated enough, and sliced very thin. it looked like a kids rice plate.   I told the owner, and he went to the kitchen to confirm if they had served me cold food. Of course they said no, so he thought it would be good business to give me a measly 10% off. Wow!! I should have listened to all my friends who told me not to eat here, because their food isn't good. But I wanted to be the judge for myself and man are they right! I'm vietnamese and like trying out the new Viet restaurants, but this is off my list for good."}
{"text":"The pho is good, but I really love the crepes, I think it is called bành xèo can.   Just ask for the crepe, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My first time trying pho.... It was so pholicious. Immediately seated and order taken, drinks were brought promptly. There was only one thing that I didn't like.....the spray they wash their tables with. Over powering smell of fabulouso, I could taste it! Luckily she wasn't cleaning while I was eating. I will return!"}
{"text":"I cannot for the life of me understand how this place is empty at any time if the day. I went with my family for lunch and we during was so delicious that nobody spoke once the food arrived, they just ate. That's seriously never happened before. My boys loved the chicken and rice from the kids' menu and their won ton soup was heavenly. The staff was quick and attentive and the bathroom was clean. We don't get out to this area very often, but this will be our spot whenever we do!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had never had pho before.  We'd decided on this place because it is right up the street andfriends reccomended it.  Family owned restaurant and we were very pleasantly surprised.  The chili fish sauce wings weren't AMAZING!  And the shrimp pho rocked. Only gripe, if there was anything is the amount of shrimp and size.  However, the complexity of the broth and overall taste of soup over rode anybody downs regarding the shrimp.  It was definatley enough, I just like bigger shrimp.  We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Here I go. First off, I feel this if the best pho on the west side. I've tried them all. The broth is not at all bland like some of the reviews state. IT'S PERFECT!! The owner is a very nice man, always waves when I walk in & that's good enough for me. The spring rolls are awesome. I think what some people are use to is how some other places put oil on their noodles, that right there will give it flavor. I myself workout & eat healthy so I'm really conscious what I eat. If you're looking for pho loaded with MSG or broth that taste like sugar water, then this isn't your place. If you're looking for a healthy bowl of pho then this is your spot. This is my opinion & I will only eat here for a bowl of pho....its a 25 min drive from my house but well worth it.......FYI, I can't speak for their other dishes, only their pho......Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Great Pho and egg rolls! We come back regularly and have eaten our fair share of Pho around the valley. The staff is always attentive and the establishment is clean. It is busier each time we come back, that speaks for itself. It is family owned, and the owner is always trying to please everyone that walks in the door. I have had the chicken and beef Pho dishes, love them both! I highly recommend Pholicious if you are looking for authentic PHO."}
{"text":"Nope. I was super excited to see a Vietnamese restaurant  that had decent reviews. I haven't had good pho since moving from Boston MA in 2015. Long over due and have been craving some. I was extremely disappointed.  Pho is flavorless and just all around not good. My fiance got a sesame chicken dish that was greasy and covered in sauce that had no flavor at all. Service was meh..

 The spring rolls and their peanut sauce were really really good though.

It's really hard finding a good legitimate Korean/Asian/Vietnamese etc. spot in Arizona. 

So no I will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst place ever - service was absolutely diabolical.  Never ever will go there again.  Manager was exceptionally rude!"}
{"text":"My first review.  I'm a bit nervous.

Nice big bowl of spicy pho to cool you off on a hot day. The frosty mug of beer helped considerably. Oodles of noodles, sprouts, basil and wonderful condiments to add to your pho to make it the way I like it.

My first pho was at Cyclo - firsts are hard to forget. Pholicious is closer and it is OK."}
{"text":"Super delicious pho, very friendly service that goes the extra mile to make their guests feel comfortable, and wonderful atmosphere. The server brought us complimentary tea that was delicious and a nice touch. 

I only wish that the menu offered a vegetarian option, with more veggies and tofu in the broth. There were no veggie options. I also wish that the TV had not been on, as it took away from our group's discussion. 

All in all, a really great spot for pho and other Vietnamese specialties, highly recommended. The pho tasted authentic and the beef broth was rich and subtle."}
{"text":"How could you go wrong with a place name \"Pholicious\"? Many ways!  The staff was extremely nice however the service was very slow. They brought out our order individually at different times...forgivable.  NOT FORGIVABLE was the cockroach that crawled over the booth and onto my neck!  The owner or manager apologized as he handed us our bill! As we were walking out we noticed a crushed roach on the floor as well. Had we only seen it on the way in!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they have absolutely horrible service. Quantity is small and pho isnt great. Especially for the price. I walked in at 820 and they said sorry were closed? There open till 9pm they just didnt want to serve us. They have done that multiple times. If you want to close early then change your store hours!. I asked for one bowl of pho for me and my girl because we weren't all that hungry and they gave us less because i asked for an extra bowl. Wtf wont come back ever again. If you want good pho try 43rd and thomas or da vang"}
{"text":"This place was great.  I never had Pho before and it was fantastic.  Prices were reasonable, I took home leftovers.  I will be going back often."}
{"text":"This is the worst place for boba. They gave me a bland taro bubble tea and it was 5.49. Total waste of money. It didn't have the sweet taste of taro and it was literally just water and iced mixed with some purple coloring. Never come here!!"}
{"text":"This is a place I always hit once a month.  I always get the Pho that has no meat, but just broth and ask them to add vegetables.  WOW!  They throw is carrots, cabbage and all sorts of stuff that gives the pho a new twist.  They do charge a little extra for changing up the plate, but its nice that they allow it.  Some places don't allow you to make changes to the dish.  Service is average, but the food brings this review definitely to four stars"}
{"text":"Pholicious is a new vietnamese restaurant that just opened in Peoria.  I just love the name of this restaurant: PHO - [pronounced fuh, or fur] is vietnamese beef noodle soup that has existed for more than 90 years + LICIOUS - these days you can add that suffix to just about any base word and you know it is something good. 

Anyways, got a flyer in the mail for this place and being a fan of vietnamese food decided to give it a go.  We walked in to a restaurant filled with Vietnamese people.  Now this gets me excited because I know it has to be authentic and delicious.  

I ordered a cup of crab/asparagus soup - $2.95 for a cup!  And more than a generous amount. Shrimp fried rice - $7.95! Delicious, tasty, cooked to perfection.  The shrimp were not the baby shrimp, but were rather large.  D. ordered the vermicelli w/beef - $6.95!  This was an absolutely delicious dish, extremely flavorful. 

There are sooooo many things to try on this menu, the selection is huge and the prices cannot be beat.  I know we will be back soon to dine-in or order take-out."}
{"text":"Tried this place multiple times and came out with meh feeling. Their Pho is Americanized with the broth tasting decent to tasting like water. I had to added hoison sauce and siracha into my broth for flavor. Their Com Tam Suon Nuong is good, but as for Pho and the rest of the items on the menu; I highly recommend avoiding it (Especially their Bun Bo Hue and Ga Ca-Ri)."}
{"text":"So delicious!! The name does it no justice. The staff are always kind. It's a really nice place to go and relax and have some really good pho!! They have excellent broth that keeps me coming back over and over. They play movies or sports on the tv which is a really nice touch. Trust me you have to try this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant. I'm a Vietnamese food newbie, and the waiter was helpful in suggesting which pho would be good for me. I and my companion both enjoyed our food. 
It's a bit hard to spot from the road, but it's a great place to eat if you're feeling like something different from Panda across the street."}
{"text":"I would give pholicious no stars if it was possible. More like phogusting! The chicken was dry, the Pho broth was bland, and my friend found a hair in her soup and the manager was phodiclous, making it seem like the black hair in her soup came from her red head. He was mean. Pho Tan Tann is across the street. Try there. Skip this place."}
{"text":"My gosh, it's been the $8 bowl of noodles streak... this apparently is the new price point when you go to newer joints with higher rents.  Had the wonton pho bowl, the individual ingredients were fresh and tasy but the broth itself was very bland.

We'll be back, but probably b/c more so of its location right across from the W. Valley Lee Lee's."}
{"text":"Love the pho here...let me just get that out right away.  Felt a little skimped on the meat but overall, it tasted delicious.

Now...why a 3 star rating?  A  few things...my co worker wanted to order their lunch special, they don't allow that if it's for takeout.  Ok..fine, let's pay the full price cuz he wanted the orange chicken.  Then it's an additional $1 for fried rice, a little steep but ok...he's willing to pay that too.  Then comes the moment of truth, he opens his box of Orange chicken with fried rice which he just paid $11 for, and it's so sparce we thought they might have made a mistake.  Turns out, that's just how much they give.  

While the portions on the Pho are great, they really skimped on the other food that he paid good money for.  You can get 3x the food at the Chinese place we usually go to.  So extremely disappointed with that and thus the 3 star rating.  I will definitely still be eating the Pho here, but I can guarantee no one from my work will EVER buy the Chinese food here again..."}
{"text":"Best Pho place on the west side of Phoenix.  So why only 3 stars for the best Pho on the west side.  Easy I am from California and lived many years in Westminster AKA little Sigon. The Pho in Arizona is okay at best.  This place has a nice staff, the food comes out quickly, and the price is okay.  We eat here usually before going to Lee Lee's.  Not a bad place, just not great."}
{"text":"Easily the WORST Pho I've ever had! And that speaks volumes!

The broth was salty and the meat was grisly...ewwww...

I was pretty much ignored as well.

I want to like Pholicious, I really do! Partly because it's directly across the street from where I work, but after giving it 2 tries I just cannot bring myself to endorse it.

Sad really..."}
{"text":"Second time going to this place i really liked the food but the service was not good at all there was a really young guy that was the waiter and we had to go up to him to order our food and when we were barely starting to eat our food he threw the bill at our table. They were not even busy for him to be so rude to everyone, the person next to me complained of him also."}
{"text":"ATTN PHO PROS: DON'T EAT HERE

I noticed the mixed reviews for this place, but decided to give it a try because it was recommended to me by a fellow Yelper.  I was surprisingly disappointed.  Here's my phonalysis:

Spring rolls: loosely wrapped and lacking flavor. It had way too much noodles stuffed in there to make the roll seem bigger. Even the peanut sauce was mediocre. I mean, how do you screw up the peanut sauce?

Broth: I was super excited when my pho came out because it was steaming and looked amazing. That is, until I tasted the broth. It was so bland, I'm not sure if they boiled any herbs. Actually, it didn't even have a beef flavor, so maybe they tossed in some boiling water and sprinkled instant pho seasoning?

Meat: Very tender and fresh, but very small portions.

Vegetables: Very fresh and perhaps the only non-disappointing thing of the night, but doesn't redeem everything else.

I'm giving this place one star for friendly service and how frequently the waitress refilled our water. I know I'm a pho snob and I'm not saying the soup was disgusting, but I would definitely NEVER come back here.  There are much better places in the valley for great pho."}
{"text":"I had the special of the day which was oxtail Pho and it was so good. I have not been in a restaurant that has been as clean as this one. Service was great.  I wish that I lived closer to them so they could deliver."}
{"text":"I hate pho. I do. I hate almost all Asian food save Malaysian, Thai and Indian. And those can be pretty interchangeable considering the former is often a hodgepodge of the latter. I find pho boring, and only eat it when I'm sick. You know this. You read Jetta R's review already.

So what's with the 5 stars, right?

I'm a skeptic to the extreme. We ordered Thai iced tea and I was very, very dissapointed (and a wee bit smug) that theirs comes right out of the can. That was all it took for me to cross my arms and begin the nay-saying. We're waiting for her General Tsao Chicken, and my Orange Chicken lunch special. Poor Jetta's puppy-dog-facing me over the table, trying to placate my snide and pessimistic predictions about the food we'd yet to be served. 

\"Watch. It's going just to be plain chicken breasts with orange slices on top.\"

And then it came, and I shut my mouth. It was so...pretty. Fried rice shaped into a perfect little mound. Crispy chicken glistening in sweet-but-not-too-sweet-even-if-you're-super-picky-like-me sauce. And the taste. OMG. I'm a believer in Chinese food again. Chinese food from a Vietnamese restaurant. And sprinkled throughout - why yes, tiny little mandarin orange slices, cut into quarters. 

What the hell, Pholicious? Are you trying to kill me with perfection? I've got a reputation to keep. 

Maybe it was a fluke. Maybe I could still hate this place. Jetta and I returned today, me with chopsticks in hand and ready for a show down. It's on now, bitches. Kung Pao Chicken. Bring it. 

And they did, while smiling and telling my bestie she looked pretty today. Damn, they're sneaky!

And the chicken? 



...perfect. Again. Jetta's pho? Also perfect. And I HATE pho.

You win this time, Pholicious. I admit defeat. Take your 5 stars while I sulk off into the sunset. 

Can we rematch tomorrow?"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. No basil (not out of basil, they actually don't even buy it for the restaurant), rotten looking bag of sprouts. A single tiny sprig of wilted cilantro. Two little packets of hoisin sauce allowed. 
I got it to go and the whole thing looked so gamey and rotten I was scared to eat it. The \"beef\" looked like old jerky soaked in water. 
Zero customer service, the restaurant has only been open a short while but already looks dirty and old. Owner answers the phone with \"who is this?\", has no interest in hearing about my experience. 
I love pho, but will never waste $7 here again. Tossed the meal in the trash to avoid potential food poisoning. The people here are not even trying, doubt it will last long."}
{"text":"Very good Pho. Had the #15 (tender beef) and egg rolls and both were outstanding. Will definitely be back to this place for my Pho fix."}
{"text":"The inconsistency of this place has lost my business. I got a glass with lipstick on it, there's layers of dust on the lights above the tables, and my wife usually gets a blended boba and now they don't blend them (as we hear and see the blender). The phó is alright but not spectacular."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good!  The broth in my pho wasn't as tasty as I normally like it but it was still good.  My daughter loved the pho noodles (the only thing she eats).  Service was pretty decent and I liked that they had tofu spring rolls even though the peanut sauce was just OK.  We would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed with pholicious because I called about 2 hours ahead and told them I would be there at a specific time to pick up my order. I called again 30 minutes before to let them know I was on my way. As I got there I had to wait another 30 minutes for my order. When it was finished it was tossed on the counter. I asked if that was my order and and was ignored. Then I signed the check and tried to give it to the cashier and he just kept walking away from me. So I checked the boxes to make sure it was my order (and it was) so I left. After I arrived to my destination and c
Was getting everyone's pho ready. The beef was completely raw. Not rare. Raw!"}
{"text":"The bubble tea at Pholicious was so terrible it was comical.  While walking around the mall, we saw a bubble tea poster and quickly stopped for a drink.  We ordered two bubble teas prior to checking the reviews... definitely a mistake!  

In both of our drinks the tapioca balls were just terrible! More like tapioca mush that constantly got stuck in the classic oversized straw.  They were not chewy or remotely delicious.  It was as if someone had all the ingredients to make boba balls, but not the instructions on how to do it."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and recently moved here from Seattle. 

I've been looking for a pho joint for weeks, this was my first (and last) time I'll eat here. 

The noodles were way too soggy and there was way too much noodles in the bowl. There were literally 5 slices of meat and just broth. I was given only one stem of basil and a piece of lime so small it was insignificant. 

The only good thing about my lunch was the waiter - he was polite. But maybe that's bcus I'm Vietnamese. Who knows."}
{"text":"Really not a review of the food since I didn't eat any....I came for lunch and was revolted by the smell when I walked through the door. Not sure if it was sewer gas or the food but it was awful.  Made a lame excuse and left quickly."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly, enthusiastic staff. I had the egg roll and pork over rice vermicelli, and Mark had the stir-fry beef with pineapple and veggies.  Both were delicious!

We also had a Vietnamese spring roll appetizer and it was both beautiful and tasted great!  Good iced Vietnamese coffee, too!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what I was expecting from mall pho. Especially mall pho about which I'd only heard bad things. The broth was tasteless and the noodles were grossly undercooked. It was just not a good experience. I implore you,  do not do this to yourself. I only gave it two stars for the very friendly cashiers."}
{"text":"Do not go here unless you are looking forward to food poisoning. I ordered a mango smoothie and 4 egg rolls. The egg rolls were made of pork, chicken and carrots. They must have undercooked them, because I ended up vomiting an hour later--both the smoothie and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Came here right when they opened on a Saturday morning to get bubble tea! I looked at the menu ahead of time and picked avocado flavor which they also had on the list of choices in the store. However they said they didn't have it which was odd since it was right when they opened. The restaurant was really nice and clean, loved the ambiance. Employees were super nice as well and we'll be back to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely gonna be biased and say this is the best pho restaurant but then again, it's the only pho restaurant I've been to. Why look for other pho restaurants when I've found the best? Customer service is always on point. The wait is never long probably like 10 minutes at the most. Portion is a good size as well. If you've never tried pho or are looking for a new place, definitely come try pholicious :)"}
{"text":"Okay, judging a Vietnamese restaurant on the decor is a little jaded IMHO.  Ambience is certainly a factor when dining, and if that's your most pressing criteria you're probably not fit to go into most Vietnamese places.
Pholicious does a great job with their food-went their for lunch over the weekend and tried their oxtail pho which was very good.  My buddy had chicken & vegetable chow fun which was also delicious.  Sizable portions and the most unique serving of Thai iced coffee I think I've ever had.  Almost like a half old time Italian espresso pot on top of a coffee cup that holds the coffee and condensed milk.  You're supposed to stir this then add the contents to the accompanying glass of ice.  Unlike dummy me who just dumped it in the ice :)"}
{"text":"Watermelon boba tasted good but it was hella overpriced and there were maybe 5 boba pearls in the entire drink."}
{"text":"EDIT

Ok  walked in and ordered take-out.  I expected a 10/15 minute wait.  There was no one in front of me.  No during the course of' my (what would be a) 25 minute wait.  I watched several more people come in after me and be seated at different tables.

10 mins go by - everyone dining in is enjoying their refreshing canned thai teas and enjoying the apps.

15 mins go by - people are starting to get their lunchs.  I think, \"Cant be long now.\"  Holy eff was I wrong.  The waitress comes out of the kitchen, sets food down on the table next to me and walks off.

20 mins goes by -  some random vietnamese dude walks straight in and sits at the table next to me with the food that the waitress had put down 5 minutes ago.  I know this because there was a clock right in front of my face.  The waitress then comes out and the random vietnamese dude starts bitching about his food and she takes it back into the kitchen.  At this point the chef coming rolling out and sits down in front of him with his food and starts eating it!  Turns out they're very friendly with eachother and the enitre wait staff has a good laugh.

25 mins in kids.

I have a mini meltdown when the waitress comes out of the kitchen to serve someone their pho who has just walked in like 10 mins ago.

finally got up and asked for my money back.  

At the point the waiter opened the kitchen door and said its ready.  If its fucking ready give it to me.  I was about to freak out but there were some young buff vietnamese guys there and I didnt know if I started trouble if I would just have to fight the waitstaff and kitchen help at Pholicious or if the vietnamese clientele would join in and fight me as a gang.

The dude refused my money back and handed me the bag of food that had probably been just sitting there the whole time.  What a bunch of fucktards these people at Pholicious are.  With the kitchen storage area in the dining room and your 2 gallons of shampoo from walmart.

I get the food home and I have a hungry wife and daughter.  The crab and asparagus soup sounded great and had gotten great reviews.  What the fuck yelpers?  This was nothing more than canned egg drop soup with white asparagus chunks and diced fake crab meat.  diced, fucking diced.  Thats some old school false advertising there.  Fake crab sucks balls.

I also had the sliced pork and vermicelli with chopped egg rolls.  The egg rolls had decent taste but didnt taste fresh.  Evertyhting else was dry dry bland fuckitty band.

Thanks for the overall shitty experience Pholicious."}
{"text":"I actually thought the decor was awesome. Staff was very friendly too. Haven't eaten yet so can't comment there"}
{"text":"The flavor of the Pho was very good.  However, they need better utensils for consuming it.  I had the vegetarian pho, so I can't speak for the ones with meat."}
{"text":"Very good Pho, orange chicken was good, service was good and restaurant was clean.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious food and comfortable ambiance. My son's favorite combination: #23 pho khong and the #76 com thit grilled pork really rice plate. It is a texture and flavor feast."}
{"text":"I ordered the spring rolls. The chicken tasted bad and they were not traditional. The restaurant is very dirty...it just opened and all the tables were sticky."}
{"text":"Well since I wasn't in the mood to cook dinner the other day and it was late by the time my bf got home from school so we decided to eat here...they were about to close in 30 minutes but they were nice and friendly about it...and didn't rush us or anything but I felt kind of bad since it look like they got everything cleaned up..but there was at least one customer still eating...haha so I didn't feel as bad.

We started off with spring rolls...well usually places give you three but here they gave two really big ones...so I guess the size makes up for the missing one? hehe eh it was pretty good though....had to add a little spicy chili sauce in the peanut sauce but other than that it was good..after all it's just spring rolls...

I ordered #15 which is pho noodles with rare slices of beef, the noodles were great...omg haven't had it for so long! it was not soggy so i had to eat it in a separate bowl to prevent it from sitting in the broth too long...the beef slices on the other hand was chewy and tough...that was disappointing. I ate mostly the noodles and soup but didn't really like the beef. My bf ordered some fried rice dish with crispy chicken which he claims is really good.  

I was mainly surprised that they have a good Pho place in Arizona....that was actually owned by Vietnamese people...most of the ones back home is owned by like Chinese people..lol Services were definitely nice..=) 

So this place....like most Pho places...closes at 9pm!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident while I was looking for my hair stylist's new salon.  The restaurant is in a strip center, but it's hidden from sight by a bank building from the intersection, so I had never noticed it before. And am I ever glad we found it!

We started our meal with hot tea (lovely loose leaves in a delicious cup of tea) and summer rolls.  The summer rolls are my standard way to start a Vietnamese meal, and these were among the best that I've ever had.  The green ingredients were crisp and fresh, the shrimp were perfectly done (not mushy), and the peanut sauce was delicious.

We both had vermicelli dishes with grilled meats and fish sauce.  Mine had an egg roll, along with grilled shrimp and chicken.  Once again, the ingredients were all very fresh and well-prepared.  I would have liked to have had a few more veggies in the dish (maybe shredded carrots and a little more mint), but overall, it was very good.

We had the fried banana and ice cream dessert, and were pleasantly surprised by the side dish of warm coconut milk sauce that accompanied the dessert, especially when we dipped the fried banana into the dish and found multi-colored boba balls hiding in the sauce.  I'm a huge fan of boba balls, and so I'll go back to Pholicious for this dessert alone!!

We found the service to be prompt, efficient and friendly.  The owner stopped to chat, asking how we had found the restaurant, and explaining that they prepare everything fresh from the time it's ordered, and that it can sometimes cause dishes to take a little longer to prepare.  Our meal was delivered very promptly, and I didn't see anyone in the restaurant who looked like they were displeased with their food or the service.

The decor is certainly not upscale, but it is a lot nicer than some other Vietnamese restaurants I've visited in the Valley.  There's a large Buddha just inside the door, and then a large Greco-Roman statue of a goddess in the middle of the restaurant (perhaps left over from a previous owner of the space??), and of course, there was a Santa Claus on the counter...very eclectic, but fun!

We will certainly return to Pholicious again soon, and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"For those of us on the west/southwest end of Cuyahoga county needing a pho fix this place has come to save the day.  Located in the very center of Southpark mall - where the escalators are located - Pholicious is serving up a good quality bowl of pho.  There are some options on the type of meat you want in the broth, and they even offer a vegetable option, too.  

Spring rolls are good, and come filled with chicken and shrimp.  They offer the usual bubble tea selection.  I really love the Vietnamese coffee version.

Moderately priced, and offering great views for people watching.

My favorite thing about it may be that it's away from the main food court, so you're not dining in teenage purgatory."}
{"text":"Decent pho, really good boba, fast and friendly service. This is a good place to have a quick and tasty meal after shopping for Asian groceries at Lee Lee across the street. 3.5 stars for now, based on what I've tried so far. Hoping it will be bumped up to 4 after the next visit."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time. My husband had a chicken vegetable dish that came in a crunchy noodle bowl. He said it was good but much preferred the spring roll dipping sauce left over from appetizers than the sauce in his dish. I took a chance and ordered a special Pho - with pork, chicken, shrimp and beef. I paid extra for the beef but boy was it worth it! It was delicious! I have food sensitivities and if they had used any MSG or anything artificial in the soup base I would have known about it! But it was all good - and amazingly flavorful to boot. You have to be patient with the servers as they have limited ability to understand special requests - but that is what I love about the authentic international cuisine restaurants - they are authentic! And they did a great job anyway - just point if you have trouble. We will be back for sure - we are now fans!"}
{"text":"Was on travel through the area and stopped at this mall. Decided to try it out and it was a very big disappointment. The place itself was small and appeared okay. It was relatively clean and simple looking. However, the food was a different story. The pho was microwaved and the noodles were not fully cooked. It was served in a clear plastic container and was cold when first served. We gave it back and they microwaved it some more to make it hotter. I'm not a pho expert, but I've never seen it served this way (Maybe I've been sheltered, spoiled by real pho places in Atlanta and plus, never seen it offered at a mall food court). It was also super oily, probably due to the way it was prepared. When we took it back they were pretty indifferent. I think this kind of attitude shows in the food. When people don't care, how can the food be good? Basically, the pho was not edible, so we just left it there and were out $16 and went somewhere else. Should have read the reviews before trying."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here regularly. The staff are friendly, but they sort of just float around. The service is not very structured, so if you like a dedicated waiter/waitress and regular check-ins, you might be put off. They keep the drinks full and are quick to take your order, but they're not around every moment.   The Pho is good, but we typically get the vermicelli noodle bowls, which are large portioned and super delicious. 

The dining room is pleasant and quiet, and the prices are very reasonable. I recommend to anyone looking for a casual, quick, dinner out."}
{"text":"Upon entering, I thought the inside was pretty roomy and big enough for huge crowds ! As I found my seat the waiter offered me a drink and I went with a green tea and a water. After browsing through the menu I decided to go with the basic orange chicken and rice. Instead of white rice I substituted it out for fried rice. 

The food came out rather quickly! Considering there was only 3 other family's enjoying their meals. As the waiter placed down my plate I decided to go straight to the orange chicken! I wasn't disappointed and it was rather tasty! I couldn't complain about that. Now once I finished my orange chicken I went for the rice. After taking a few bites I noticed that the rice was a little dry and stale. Some pieces were harder than others....

As I went to collect my check and pay. I found out that they didn't accept American Express. Which was a downfall. So thankfully I had a little extra cash in my wallet to cover my tab."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Their pho is so bomb and the prices are really good for all the food you can get.. the service is so welcoming and friendly. My fav pho place on this side of town by far!"}
{"text":"Pho-aholic here. I am a pho fanatic and am extremely critical to any pho that I eat, it has to be perfect darn it! Pholicious was by far the cleaniest/prettiest pho restaurant I have ever been to. Their pho was good, but because I am a pho fanatic having lured into any place that says pho, I have to give it three stars. The flavor was good but not great. It's a nice spot to try pho, but for all us pho enthusiast it just wont fully satisfy. The service was great, everyone was very polite and nice. I would give it 3.5 stars if it was an option."}
{"text":"This was a first for my husband and I. It actually got us hooked on pho because we didn't know what to expect or have high expectations. I got the shrimp pho (not sure of the technical name). Tasted like an up graded ramen noodle...but it was good to me. After posting the picture my friends said it looked like fake pho and I needed to try real pho. We also got the mango bubble tea smoothie, we didn't care for it to much. Also tried the shrimp egg rolls, they were ok. The owner was real friendly and patient with us and everyone who came in. I would eat the pho here again mainly because of the cheap price, don't know about trying anything else!"}
{"text":"The owner was extremely rude and did not even have a sign on the door to indicate if it was closed or not, he was making rude gestures toward us and I was very offended. There bubble tea was about as appealing as the Wii U is to professional gamers."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but - so far so good.
1) good location, I can walk there, the parking isn't stressful if you arrive by car, NW corner of 75/cactus.
2) the server was quick, attentive and seemed really appreciative to have us as customers. Always nice to feel valued as a customer!
3) the pho - delicious, filling!
 I'll add more when we go back, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The place is soooooo dirty. The food tastes nothing like it should at all. The pho broth was bland and the meat looked iffy- old meat. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly. But the food has been hit or miss lately. This last time I ordered fried rice and there was a thick black hair in it... embedded in the eggs!!! YUCK. 

They did get rid of that awful pine sol smell that permeated the whole place so they get stars for that. 

Service is always attentive and speedy so they get stars for that too! The pho is usually great but the last few times the broth was not as flavorful. I think it depends on what day it is. I also ordered a boba tea and the tapioca was mush. My husband who loves boba also didn't want to drink from it. 

It is kid friendly so another star for that. They do have high chairs and bring out special plates and utensils for the littles."}
{"text":"We kept coming back to this restaurant even after we moved, and especially after trying other mediocre Vietnamese restaurants in the valley. But I think they changed the cook or kitchen staff recently, the food is not as great as it was before. They need to rehire that cook or kitchen staff and give him / her or them a raise!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho  place right now , great price great service, and food is great. I get Pho with rare beef and meatball u can get double the meat for a couple extra dollars."}
{"text":"Here we go....
I'm always trying new Pho in the area. I actually order Mi but whatever, same thing but with egg noodles.

Anyway, I drove out here at lunch time and the place was pretty empty. There was some white guy sitting at the table next to me talking to his friend, a Vietnamese girl...I know this because he must have said Vietnam, your home town, teach me, blah blah blah...about 100 times as loud as possible. He also spoke as loudly as he could about being in marketing and her getting a job for some famous company in NYC...ugh, I wanted to leave.

Ok, that's not the fault of Pholicious so I will move on.

I ordered my usual Spring rolls and Mi.  I got the pork spring rolls and they were \"ok\" but the peanut sauce was so gross I thought I was going to toss cookies just looking at it. It didn't even taste like peanut and it was watery as heck.

On to the Pho (actually Mi).....it was surprisingly good. The BBQ pork was tasty, the wontons were good but the fish balls weren't that great. The broth was pretty good too. 

I don't think I'll be heading down this way again though...there is better joints in the valley."}
{"text":"I am rarely at a loss for words and am normally excited about writing reviews, but I really struggled with this particular one.

I really wanted to like this place! 

But like my uncomfortable experiences reprimanding a good employee for making an uncharacteristic decision, or scolding one of my children for using words unbecoming of them - this is a review that I do not relish writing.

However, as it has been often said, the show must go on! So here it is...

We were at the Oriental Grocery store across the street when we spotted this Vietnamese Restaurant. Actually, I spotted the Angry Crab, and my wife spotted Pholicious.

Angry Crab on a Friday is a dreadfully long wait, and we were both famished. So, Vietnamese it was going to be this evening!

The interior of this place is very basic. No frills, whatsoever, but we never do mind as long as the food is good.

Unfortunately, our 2 star rating indicates that it was below par, and here are the reasons why:

1) The Pho Tai, although generous in its size and portions, was comprised of what appeared to be frozen, thin pieces of some type of artificial meat that did not taste like beef. 

Typically, real beef is used, and is stewed in the broth for a prolonged period of time. That is what gives this soup its flavor. However, when I saw the very thin and evenly square pieces of beef contained within the soup, I knew that something was amiss. And when I tasted the beef, it was devoid of any familiar beef taste.

2) The Pork Chop with Over Easy Egg and White Rice was also suspect. The pork chop had good enough flavor comparable to a Korean BBQ dish, but it was so thin and had so much bone-in that it definitely evoked cheapness and low quality. This pork chop was nearly as thin as the beef that was in the Pho Tai.

3) The Curry was sweet, but lacked consistency.

4) The Egg Roll was overcooked, which resulted in the wrapping being as hard as a rock. It was so hot, that even after waiting a few minutes, it was still blistering.

The only redeeming quality was that their service is very quick (Now I know why!), and they are very friendly. 

Otherwise, this is definitely not a place that we will be returning to, unless they make improvements to the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pho and Banh Mi places, and I've been trying as many as I can. Last time I was at Concord Mills I visited Pholicious before looking them up on Yelp. Fortunately, the telltale signs of issues were right in front of me.

Walk into the cramped store and there were a few people at the counter. An ice scoop was laying directly on the counter, also a cardboard tray of bread of lying on the floor. Yes, directly on the floor near a customer table. I decided between that and the few people already in line that weren't being helped yet that I should probably try something else.

Walked back by the storefront a few minutes later and sure enough, bread still on the floor. I'll stick with my usual Pho restaurants.

Do yourself a favor if you're thinking of visiting this place, go to Cabarrus Health Alliance's inspection page a look them up. It appears that safe food handling has been a problem for them since opening."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had the Bun Bo Hue and the pork sausage spring roll.  They put fried wonton skin in the spring roll and it gave it a wonderful crunch.  The Bun Bo Hue was good but it was missing the pork hock but otherwise it was tasty.  The place was nice and clean.  When I'm in Peoria, AZ again I will be here."}
{"text":"Regarding the Pho Ga: My boyfriend felt the broth was bland and has definitely had better.

I did not feel like ordering one of the few tofu with vegetables dishes towards the back of the menu. Craving a vermicelli noodle bowl, I requested that my bowl's egg rolls be veggie. My server looked me straight in the eye and said \"Ok\". I also ordered a side of peanut sauce. He said, \"do you want tofu, too?\". That should have been my first clue he did not understand my order. My veggie egg roll vermicelli bowl came... with MEAT in it. I explained the mix up and my server offered to box it up several times. What part of \"I don't eat meat\" was getting lost in translation here?! I ended up eating a rice noodle and lettuce spring roll and becoming ravenous again 30 minutes later."}
{"text":"We were back in our old neighborhood and decided to stop in for a bowl of pho. We heard that this restaurant was under new management and hat the food wasn't the same. Um, no! The food is just as great and even better. There was a hearty serving of chicken in my pho and they were happy to provide extra sliced jalapeños and lime.  This place is still my favorite PHO  Place in town!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had!  The servers could be a little more attentive but over all love this place"}
{"text":"I went there today because we wanted pho and that was the nearest place to go to after running errands and the place is clean. The food was decent."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of pho places and this place is alright! Nothing too special about it, i only come here because its close by.

Their pho broth isnt as refreshing as other pho places but still good"}
{"text":"Yummy, it's so good! The chicken soup is good but they changed the color from white to light brown with a slightly different accepting taste. I think they use beef broth with chicken but still tastes good."}
{"text":"After many visits, I feel it's time to give them a review! I mostly come here for the Pho...but I do enjoy other things on the menu(Love their spring rolls!). Pholicious has good Pho, good prices and the staff is always friendly here."}
{"text":"My first visit. I have been seeking authentic or close enough to authentic Vietnamese food in AZ. So....I am STILL looking. Anyways, I enjoyed the Pho Tai here, yet I prefer the broth to be savory prior to me adding the condiments: hoison, Siracha, lime and typical Vietnamese garnishments. I did enjoy the temperature of the Pho it was super HOT like I like it. Portion was very good. Restaurant is clean and friendly. When I initially walked in, only a few tables were occupied with other customers and I wasn't sure if I seat myself or walk up to the register to inquire. No one greeted me, so I walked to the register to inquire and was then seated, from then it took approximately 10 minutes before I was asked if I would like anything.  I'm on the fence with my rating 3.5 to 4. from the service, but for the food it is maybe a 4 after I adjusted to my taste. I will for sure be back again. Although, the service was slow it was friendly. So I can overlook this, but hopefully future visits it is more welcoming. :)"}
{"text":"Service is good, with a friendly staff. The ambience is great with TV's hanging from the ceiling for your viewing pleasure. Unfortunately the noodles in my hubby's Pho were clumpy, and the beef had no taste. I ordered shrimp with fried rice and it was awful, so salty, but maybe that's how it's supposed to taste."}
{"text":"When your partner's least favorite kind of food is your most favorite kind of food, you have to pick and choose your battles.

For me, this means only suggesting Asian cuisine when Misty S is a) not feeling good, b) not feeling Yardhouse, or c) not paying. 

All of these scenarios have one thing in common; they rarely ever happen.

But alas, as chance would have it, Misty S and I both came down with something over the holidays.

Thus, I began my attack.

\"Let's get some pho.\"

\"I hate pho.\"

\"It'll make you feel better.\"

\"No thanks. I don't like pho.\"

\"Oh wow, you know what sounds really good right now? A big bowl of soup. Hot, steaming soup. Oh man, Ci Ci's has soup! All the chicken soup you can eat, and pizza too! Snap, chicken soup and jalapeno pizza! We'll be good in no time!\"

\"Fine, we'll do Pho.\"

Ironically, when we pulled into Pholicious we saw what may have at one point been a greasy child-infested Ci Ci's, now closed to the world like a tomb. A graveyard of all-you-can-eat-awfulness.

Walking inside, I could literally feel the steam off of other people's bowls. It was like a sriracha flavored sauna. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a gentleman drinking coconut juice right out of the fruit itself. And waiters carried around massive bowls of noodles and stuff and other stuff. 

For a moment I felt that I had found my perfect restaurant.

And that's when I panicked.

For it is practically written in the cosmos that the more I love an Asian restaurant, the more likely Misty S will find it lacking. 

See Also: Wong's

See Also: Any Chinese Buffet....ever.

One of the many joys in dining-in at any Asian restaurant (sushi included) is that I'm not expected to actually pronounce any of the items from the menu. That's why there's all the numbers.

Whenever I go for Mexican or Italian the waiter looks at me like I'm a tool if my pronunciation's off and corrects me before having a good laugh at it.

Oh, thank you, JEFF, for imparting your SUPERIOR knowledge of the Italian language onto me. Here, before you leave, can you make sure I'm pronouncing this correctly...

Vaffunculo e muoia! Now bring the check, I'm going to the Olive Garden.

I ordered the #2 (spring roll), and the #40 (egg noodle soup with barbeque pork, prawns, quail egg, and something something).

The spring roll was deceptively delicious for a bunch of shrimp, rice, and veggies rolled up in cold rice paper. It came with a nice thick peanut sauce that was topped with peanuts. I love it when there are multiple forms of the same ingredient in a dish. It's so aesthetically pleasing from a deconstructivist standpoint. Blah blah blah, pretentious bullshit, blah blah blah.

Before my number 40 came out, Misty's #10 (crab and asparagus soup) was served, and Misty invited me to take part of her soup. It was warm, eggy and soft. Almost with a hint of sweetness, I thought. Light, subtle, and very white. 

Satie, one of my favorite composers, used to eat \"white food\" so that he could get into the mood to compose \"white music\".

This is what you learn at art school.

My number 40 was awesome. Simply awesome. Spicy, sweet, sour, noodly and meaty. It even came with a side of bean sprouts and chili peppers that I could throw into the soup myself. It was like hot pot but much cheaper and without me screaming at the top of my lungs if someone could please pass me the fucking fish balls. 

The soup was so good that even after all the noodles and meat were gone I still sat there, sucking down broth by the spoonful. Misty tried several times to coach me on the proper way to hold the porcelain spoon, but alas, I make as proper a lady as I did a boy back in the day. C'est la vie, I guess.

After all the sriracha and peppers I had added, the broth was so spicy that my nose was running and my eyes were watering. I looked like I had just been cut from the Rocky Horror cast and yet I still sucked that soup like I've never had it so good. 

The waiter came by and took away the broth while I was trying to cool off with some ice. I remember thinking \"awww man, I wasn't done with that\" but aftewards feeling grateful that I was being inadvertantly saved from myself.

I feel like I've got a sniffle coming on. Maybe if I wait it out a bit I can do my sad puppy face routine long enough that Misty gives in and takes me back to Pholicious again soon.

(After learning I was writing this review, Misty would like to remind me and inform all of you that she doesn't hate ALL Asian food. She's particular to Malay and Indian food, but can't stand all that \"panda express\" nonsense I gorge myself on. Surprisingly, I don't mind being the tacky and tasteless one in the relationship.)"}
{"text":"Yelp wants me to write a big long thing about this place, but it is simply gooooooooooooooood. The meat is high quality and noodles are perfectly cooked. It is also cool that they have ABC Family on the televisions, which is my favorite channel, but they are willing to change the channel to like a sports game if you ask them. Service is always very kind and considerate, which seems to be a rarity these days."}
{"text":"either vietnamese food in phoenix is not the same as vietnamese food in nyc, dc, and boston, or this place is just not that great. overall i would just say i wasn't impressed with it. what i am used to is getting some fresh, raw veggies on the side (carrot, cucumber, watercress, herbs, etc.) and this place doesn't do that. i asked for it and i got steamed veggies instead. yuck. also the bo luc lac should be tenderloin and the quality wasn't so good (but the price reflected this). oh well."}
{"text":"I'm not very picky with my food and I usually give four stars to pho restaurants. However, I would never recommend this place to anyone.

I went to Pholicious with two other friends. We ordered two entrees of chow fun (beef and chicken), one hot and sour soup, one bowl of pho, one diet coke, and a Thai tea with boba. The chow fun noodles weren't thoroughly cooked. The hot and sour soup was extremely salty. The owner didn't bring out the vegetables until my friend was halfway done with her pho. We assumed that the vegetables cost extra so we didn't bother them.

There was a fly at our table during our entire stay. I'm sure the owners noticed since we were swatting at the fly, but they did nothing to get rid of it. The fly managed to touch our soup and vegetables. It was pretty disgusting.

The diet coke was flat and it didn't taste right. Finally, the boba in the Thai tea were frozen and it was not edible.

Our bill was around $38 with tax. I only made one complaint to the owner. I didn't want to embarrass the owner or create a scene. I told him that the boba was not edible. He took 50 cents off our bill. Thank goodness!

I managed to get the entire Thai tea off the bill. Still, I wasted $35+$2 tip on this place."}
{"text":"1st time here. We had spring rolls to start. Love them. Then I had a bun bowl; one of my favorites.  The pork looked  a little different than usual, but I totally enjoyed it. It had just the right combo of lettuce noodles pork sprouts cucumber and herbs. My husband ordered a shrimp dish with wide noodles.  He  really enjoyed it. This is the closest vietnamese place to home. We will be back.  

We have been back several times now and get the same great service and food."}
{"text":"I admit I was a tad nervous to try this place out since I read a few of the recent reviews. I always take yelper opinions into account, but I do like to give a business the benefit of the doubt - and in this case I'm glad I did!

Now I'm no pho expert, but I just wanted pho SO badly the other day and said F@#! IT let's try a new place! I ordered the pho with rare beef slices and brisket. OH. MY. Not only did it satisfy my pho craving, it instantly became my new favorite pho place so far. I can't wait to try more menu items and will certainly come back with an update!"}
{"text":"Literally the best fried rice from any Vietnamese, Thai, or Chinese restaurant I've gotten in the Phoenix valley.  Their egg rolls could have been better though, and the lettuce that came with them should have been thrown out the day before. The wonton soup was also very good."}
{"text":"When we were in AZ for our mini vacay, we relied heavily on Yelp for our meals.  My kids really wanted to eat Pho after a day of eating burgers and pizza.  We chose Pholicious just for its name.  The name is quite daring, isnt it? Being from So. Cal, we are quite spoiled when it comes to good Vietnamese food espcially Pho.  I really didnt expect much from this place.  I ordered their special clear noodle soup, pho bo for my son.  My DH ordered stir fried crunchy egg noodles and eggrolls for appetizer.  I didnt care for my noodle soup.  The broth was bland, not flavorful.  I could taste the MSG but I cant be positive.  It just didnt taste right.  I couldnt even finish half of the bowl.  Their eggrolls were ok, better than expected.  DH finished his dish, but he could be very hungry because he also finished my noodle soup.  i would rate this place 4 stars for its cleaniness and very good service.  The food only received 2.5 stars.  I rounded it up to 3 taking their service into consideration."}
{"text":"We came here after a hearty attempt at an escape room. Fairly unassuming, we were greeted enthusiastically when we entered. I decided to get some pho and the yellow curry for take home. The pho was good. Plenty of meat, lots of seasonings, it was a delightful end to the day.

The next day the curry was fine. It wasn't spectacular, but I certainly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, very pleasant and clean atmosphere. I ordered the pho tai (beef soup) and it came well presented and very tasty. My girlfriend attempted to order pho chay (veggie soup) but they did not have it on the menu. The server compromised and brought out a very poor bowl of soup with hardly a variety of veggies, just mushrooms and tofu over beef broth and of course the rice noodles. This place has potential but they need to add a pho chay on the menu and get rid of the disposable chop sticks and use plastic ones like in all the good Vietnamese restaurants. There are plenty of other good Vietnamese restaurants to enjoy, just not this one."}
{"text":"Been here total of three times, last time was because the Vietnamese place I frequent happens to be closed. Ordered their pho with everything in it. The taste of the broth was like it was made from an instant broth pho packet...blah. Service was quick."}
{"text":"Fresh food, perfect portions, always fast and friendly service all for a very reasonable price.  My husband and I are regulars here.  We start with an order of egg rolls and usually order some stir fry with veggies (#36).  They have good boba selection also."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for first time since we've been here in AZ for 2 years. Coming from California there are so many amazing PHO places we didn't think AZ would have the same.
What a pleasant surprise! Great friendly knowledgable service. Fresh pho with amazing flavor. We went there for lunch and ordered from the menu. The waiter kid came back to offer us the same thing we ordered except from the lunch special menu so we'd get a drink and save 2 bucks! I was impressed! 
Went back a few days later and had same great experience.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Not one bad thing to say about this place! Will definitely be frequenting! Spring rolls were delish and so was the Pho"}
{"text":"Located inside Concord Mills, not very expensive, & friendly staff. So far I've tried the Pho beef bowl & the Vietnamese Special Sandwich. Both tasted great to me."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my worst dining experiences. Nothing is authentic  about this place. I ordered  Beef Pho. It was terrible!!! Slow service and poorly managed."}
{"text":"The chicken pho arrived very hot which was perfect. There were plenty of toppings; scallions, cilantro. Lots of chicken. 
Egg rolls- very nicely balanced flavor. I was able to taste the ingredients separately. 
Bun thit nuong - pork was lean, I asked for extra cucumbers and no mint. It arrived how I asked for it. Some places use hot noodles, which is gross, so I specified cold noodles.
Music-traditional Vietnamese
It wasn't busy, and our server never came to check on us. 
The floor was dirty by my table. Straw and chopstick on floor.
Overall, the food was great, and I will return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Had a large Pho Tai with raw beef. Absolutely delicious best pho I've had in the PHX area"}
{"text":"Veggie broth IS NOT VEGGIE IT IS CHICKEN. sanitation rate is 91.5, disgusting. Owner always sits in the corner and doesn't help. This place uses food from the day before and they just reheat it in the microwave, the shrimp in the spring rolls are expired."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am going to start off by saying; This is a small Pho restaurant in the middle of South Park Mall here in Strongsville, OH. So I will review it as such. 

I am, a Pho enthusiast. I must admit that I love Pho from every angle and I haven't had a Pho disappointment during my time on this earth. The main thing I judge my Pho experience on is, the broth and the after effects. Meaning, will I be sweaty?, will I feel strengthened and energetic? I like to joke and classify Pho as an anti-depressant, because it does just exactly that; Makes you feel better, sometimes great.

Enough about me though, let's get to Pholicious. I'll start off with the management, which is a middle-aged gentleman who is very friendly and talkative, but not too talkative if you know what I mean. No one wants someone there asking you questions while trying to enjoy a meal, so he knows his boundaries which I highly appreciate. The rest of the staff always seems to be the same as far as who is working, 2 young lovely ladies that are extremely polite and helpful. 

So let's get to the Pho; It's way better than what you would expect from a \"fast food\" type joint in the middle of a suburban mall. The helpings are a very good size, not too much and not too little. They offer an arrangement of Beef, Chicken, Shrimp, Vegetarian and Fish Balls. They also offer Spring Rolls and Bubble Tea which I have yet to try. I usually just go with the beef, or sometimes shrimp added to it. 

They offer the typical condiments you would see at a Pho joint, none of which I ever use. They are there if you must though, Sriracha, Hoisin and so on. I prefer Pho naked, except for the plated ingredients given, which consist of Jalapeños, Bean Sprout and Lime. Just recently I had learned that they do offer fresh Basil upon request, which made me very happy. I can see why they don't just give it to you off the bat, because I am sure there are many suburbanites that waste it. So it's very understandable why they do, what they do here.

Let's talk about the broth and what stands out with it. The first thing you get is Ginger, Coriander and Salt. Yes, their Pho is a tad on the salty side, but it will not detour you from returning. The end result, is me sweating and feeling awesome, and I always have leftovers which is another plus.

So with all that said, if you are at the mall on a hardcore shopping spree and need that extra boost; Then stop by Pholicious for a wonderful bowl of Pho. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was delighted to see something new in the Concord Mills food court when I was there running errands the other day. I am a fan of Pho, but was in a weird mood and wanted some veggies in my soup.  

Pretty sure it was the owner sitting to the side, and he overheard my request for vegetables. The girl at the counter didn't seem to know what to do. I ended up ordering the chicken and vegetable Pho.  I only wanted a regular size, but realize she was already given me the large without asking, so pay attention to that. When I opened my large cup it was not filled to the top- check out the photo.  Wondering if that was on purpose or not.  

The soup base was pretty good, and the veggies were OK, as well as the noodles. The chicken was clearly microwave grilled chicken, and that kind of grossed me out. As another reviewer mentioned, my cilantro was also a bit wilted.  

 For mall food,  it was decent, but I won't be running back. They had other things and I did see that they have a Bahn mi, which I wouldn't mind trying. They had a ton of varieties of Pho."}
{"text":"It's mall food, what else can I say?
Pholicious is a true mom & pop shop in Concord Mills unlike all the other chains around the outlet mall. It smells delicious as you walk by so I had to try it out.

Overall, the place is pretty decent. I like that they also serve various types of boba tea. My biggest complaint: I wish they had some (Thai) basil at least.

It's unfair to compare against dedicated shops in OC, California."}
{"text":"This review may not even be fair to the restaurant.  This being my first Vietnamese food all I can comment on is what I liked without being able to compare it to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Until Yelp I was under the false impression that Vietnamese food was too hot and spicy for my tastes so I never even tried it, certainly not the way it was served to me. 

I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls ($3.00) and Pho with beef brisket and meatballs ($7.25).  The wrapping on the spring rolls was labeled as rice paper.  It was similar to the wrapping I didn't care for on some of the dumplings at Dim Sum so I guess I either need to develop a taste for it or find something else on the menu.  I think part of the filling was rice noodles and I didn't care for them cold either.  The sauce was, I think, Hoisin based with some chopped peanuts.  It was pretty good as is and I left it alone because I wanted to sample the entire meal the way it comes.  I think I would add a light splash of fish sauce and another of red pepper sauce, both of which were at the table.  I normally do not order appetizers because the entree is more than enough to fill me up but this time I am thinking I am just getting a bowl of soup.  This is probably no surprise to most of you, I have bowls this size in my kitchen, I use them as serving bowls when feeding multiple people family style.  At this point I wish I was with somebody who knew the ropes better than I.  I wasn't sure whether the bean sprouts and stuff that came on a separate plate were supposed to be tossed in the soup or eaten off the plate they came on, I tossed them in the soup.  I am no stranger to chop sticks but rice noodles have got to be the hardest thing I have ever eaten with them.  I am sure there is a better way than I was handling it and I must have been the source of some humor for the staff as about halfway through one of them quietly laid a fork on the table.  Other than spooning the broth out towards the end I finished the meal with chop sticks.  I did not care for the meat balls but I tend to not like pork in any meat ball.  However Pho has won me over like it seems to have every one else.

The restaurant was not very busy.  The Asians occupying a few tables on one side and me, seated in the far corner (the host's choice).  The basketball game was on the tv and all of the staff were following it.  Even though not a sports venue I was fine with this as that is about all I think a tv is good for.  Definitely a family run affair, one corner of the dining room had been set up with a laptop and I could see what looked like homework type stuff near the computer.  I was greeted and seated immediately upon entering.  and as I got up to leave my server came over and thanked me for coming in.

I wouldn't mind coming here again and I will add Vietnamese to my list of acceptable cuisines."}
{"text":"Pholicious is a new Vietnamese restaurant located in the heart of SouthPark Mall. It occupies the area where Caribou Coffee used to be, right next to the central escalators. They pretty much focus on serving pho, though they also serve goi cuon (fresh shrimp roll) and fried rolls.  They also become the first place in South Park to serve bubble tea (at least since Cali Juice left, but theirs sucked anyway). They offer your standard bowl of pho with your choice of meat, with combined meats at an additional cost. They provide bar seating, serve their pho in real dinnerware instead of disposable, and they bus the dishes when you're finished. 

This is a concept that, while not new to more culturally diverse areas of the country, is fairly foreign to suburban Ohio. Pho inside a mall? I was curious but reluctant to try. Given what it is, I did not have high expectations, but they exceeded them by a mile and earned a fan. I had the \"regular\" size pho with beef and beef balls. It was small, but everything tasted fantastic. The broth was exceptional. The beef was served rare (as it should be), and the beef balls were just right. I thought they could have provided more bean sprouts and noodles. Besides that, it was a delicious bowl of pho. I would probably opt for the large size next time since the regular wasn't really filling. The honeydew bubble tea smoothie also passed the test. The boba wasn't perfect and there wasn't much of it in there, but overall, it was delicious and will definitely suffice if you want some bubble tea while shopping. 

I definitely recommend this place to pho noobs and pho connaisseurs  (phonnaisseurs?) alike. This is not your typical mall food. The pricing is competitive with other Vietnamese restaurants, so at $7-8 per meal, it might be more than what you'd pay at the food court, but you're getting a different product. While not quite on par with the more popular pho restaurants downtown, it's easily a step above the Asian eateries in the mall and is actually authentic. So if orange chicken just isn't cutting it, look no phurther than Pholicious phor your pho phix. Yeah, I just did that. I'll see myself out."}
{"text":"Its convenient, fast, and cool coz its in the mall, but lets get real! Portion size to price is ridic! Way overpriced for fast food pho. The broth tastes pretty decent though! Great idea. Could improve on customer service skills a little though. All in all if ur craving it, go for it, closest pho place away is about 15 mins away."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a Friday afternoon, they had 4 other tables.  The place is clean and service was ok.  I had the egg rolls, bun with bbq pork, and soy milk.  The egg rolls were crispy but I did not like the insides.  It was missing the meat portion for the extra taste.  The bun with bbq pork was ok too.  The noodles were very cold (normally it should be room temp.) and the pork slices were so thin.  I have not found a GREAT PHO place yet on the West side."}
{"text":"My husband and I were hopeful for their bubble tea since it's so close to us, but we were sadly disappointed. I had the coconut and my husband had the taro and it was the worst we've had and we have had a lot of bubble tea coming from NYC. It was basically like having chopped ice with no flavoring at all so save your $5!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews first and save yourself some time and money. Ok so I have been craving Pho for two months and was excited to see a Pho place in the mall. Well my excitement was short lived. This place was terrible. I'm not sure if they really know what Pho is. I will not be eating here again and wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"This place has very great food!!! But the service kind of stinks!! Every time we come in it feels like forever until we're given menus. Then sometimes they help other people that JUST walk in, instead of keeping the order that people arrive in. Food great, subpar service. The young woman that works there is a very hard worker though. She's running around while the other helper stays behind the register. I applaud her!!"}
{"text":"Was really craving some Pho, came across the place.
Good food at good prices! I got the plain pho in beef broth and added veggies, and the bowl was HUGE! The service was good as well, will definitely be returning if we are ever on that side of town!"}
{"text":"I've done it; it took 2 months(!) but I've finally found a decent pho spot in Phoenix.

Background: Originally from the Bay Area, love pho (regular spots are Turtle Tower in SF, Pho Kim Long in San Jose), spending 3 months in Phoenix for work. First thing I do in a new area is scope out the good eats, especially a pho spot to help cure any hangovers. 

The good: 
Atmosphere is small and friendly, service and cleanliness is above average. 

I ordered #14, which is the standard beef combo with all the fixins (steak, brisket, tripe, tendon, beef ball). The soup is flavorful and seasoned well. The accouterments are fresh and clean, and the noodles were standard. I have never seen it before, but they add black pepper to the soup which added to the flavor. 

Price was $11 for pho and coffee, which seems very standard.

The bad: 
There is only one size available, which is unusual. If you are especially hungry (I was not), I would recommend an appetizer or ask for a large (but I'm not sure if they would accommodate this since I didn't try). I felt a little skimped on meat, and there was barely any tripe (which I love), but once again, I'm fairly sure you can pay more for extras/large. 

My coffee was super sugary, more like condensed milk with a spot of coffee.
Next time I will ask for the milk on the side. 


Summary: 
So yes, mission accomplished, this spot makes the grade. 
When I went up to pay, I did noticed they had gotten 3 \"A\" health inspection ratings, which is always a good thing to see.

If you haven't noticed, the yelp reviews for some of the other pho spots are all glowing (4 to 5 stars), but I don't feel they are accurate at all. This place is strong 3.5 stars; will be going there again."}
{"text":"I love the pho here and just don't understand the bad reviews. I used to get the chicken pho, but yes it lacked a little flavor, so if you're a meat eater, don't skimp and get the pho with tender beef. The broth is so rich and delicious and veggies so fresh. I also recommend banh xeo (#5 on the appetizers)"}
{"text":"Worst pho ever. Threw it out after two bites only had chicken and noodles in it. Don't waste your money especially if your use to authentic pho"}
{"text":"Mehh...A-OK. I've been here multiple times for the past several years, and I'm not sure why..The pho is alright, don't like the taste as much as some other places I've tried. The service is not good, and the prices are higher than most. 

The restaurant itself looks pretty nice and clean, and parking is always convenient. There's never too many people when I go, but the food is just alright.."}
{"text":"Well I had high hopes for this restaurant. The boba was awesome. However I got my order to go and that could've been part of the problem. My food was lukewarm and I was not very satisfied with my Pho. The Mongolian beef was good but sort of bland. 

I probably will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I have a new Pho restaurant! Staff was very friendly, all smiles, attentive and accommodating to my news. I ordered the Sping Rolls, Beef Soap with extra beef, and a diet. 

What can I say? The food was delicious! I learned from the server (who spoke English) that they put Ginseng in the broth...Nice touch! Very healthy! After all that, I didn't feel to full, yet was satisfied. 

I'm definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I really like Pholicious. It is not my favorite pho in the valley, but it is my favorite close to me where I can get take out from. We usually get it 1-2xs a week. The price is right and the people are always friendly. If you are in the area, I would give it a shot."}
{"text":"Thin and crispy chicken on #77 delicious . I swapped out the white rice for fried rice.  While a little dry, it had a good flavor. Excellent service,  fair prices."}
{"text":"great place to have pho after shopping across the street for groceries, the ambience is nice and the food is very tasty."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here after finding a place close to our house. She's a little inexperienced with Vietnamese food, so I was hoping it would be something she liked so we could come here often, as I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine. Hands down best I've found in the valley. She had #54, I had #52. EXCELLENT is an understatement! We'll become regulars, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried the sandwich. It was The worst Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) that I've ever ate. It's not real banh mi. The bread is not crispy. It is just like the American bread that you eat with the hotdog, very soft. Even I saw her toast it, but when She gave it to me, it was cold, feel nothing warm like you just take out from the oven. I have to say this kind of sandwich shouldn't be considered Banh Mi. 
The second time I bought the Vietnamese coffee with price $3.99, and the total after tax is $4.31. I paid by my credit card. I didn't know they was cheating so I just tossed the receipt. Now, I check my bank and see Pholicious charged me $6.00 even. BE AWARE. NEVER BUY ANYTHING AT THIS CHEATING SMALL STORE AGAIN!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo..... here's the story.  I'm in the nail salon getting a mani-pedi.  Haven't eaten since the night before because i was too damn lazy to make anything, and my friend wants to go shopping...  We decide to grab a bite and Pholicious is on the way from toes to shoe store.

We enter the empty dining room and are seated in the corner near an edge.  Weirdest mix of music i have ever heard... Christmas music and pop tunes... but it's the beginning of March.  The service is waaaaay too slow. 

We I order Pho and spring rolls.  My friend orders something with pork and some other kind of roll.  I think they called it a summer roll.  Mine was good.  Hers was so bad that we split the rest of mine.

Other than the weird music and slow service, my lunch would have been ok.  If we had gone off what my friend had, I'd NEVER go back.

The service was so slow that we never had time to go shoe shopping."}
{"text":"I ate there when it first opened. Had a bowl of that pho crap. no one including the manager could translate the menu for us. Terrible."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! I go here all the time and I have never had a bad experience. I once brought my family here for my Mom's birthday and the owner gave my Mom a free margarita! I've brought friends along before too and they all enjoyed the pho. I highly recommend Pholicious."}
{"text":"Good honest pricing. Good food good service. 
We ordered for take out, which is awkward with all the parts of a Pho Bowl, but it was ready on time and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Really dirty. I wanted- no NEEDED, veggie pho but they didn't have any which turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I really believe I may not have survived this dining experience. They literally keep their bean sprouts in a box on the floor. Crusty countertop, layers of fingerprints on the glass... just a neglected feeling and an accident waiting to happen. I would think the mall would regulate where the health department has failed. I got a salad next door at the smoothie /build a salad place and it didn't make me sick so that's a positive. I hope these guys make some much needed improvements because good pho at the mall would be epic."}
{"text":"Food is yum. Price is awesome.  First time here and we will be back.  Everything fresh!!  Service was awesome!  Come enjoy. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Vermicelli dishes have great portion compared to other places here in the valley. 

The broth for the pho tastes fresh and they have a good amount of options.

Like any pho place should be service is quick. Getting food out doesn't take long and we had a party of 6. I definitely will be back to this place.

It is a little awkward when you walk in, not sure if you seat yourself or you get seated. I think either or will work here.

There is a yogurt place inside too. Didn't try it. But some of my friends say its okay. 

Definitely one of your cleaner pho options intown as well."}
{"text":"I usually get a take-out since my husband doesn't like Pho.
I've noticed that broth is better if you get it to go. Whenever I eat it there, broth seem very greasy. You can just see the layer of oil covering the top of soup. 
Servers are nice, but slow. They tend to forget drinks and food order. Take forever to get refill, more time to get check. Just like what Derek R said, I've also seen people walk in after me yet have food out in less than a minute. So they do have their \"favorites\" for sure.

My best suggestion is call in for take out, you'll get best food and service that way."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh...I had #53 (I think it was) that was some greenery shredded up with carrots and beef slices on top - delicious!
I had to ask the waiter for help, because I didn't know the foods there.  Went with his recommendation and wasn't disappointed that's for sure!
Going back for sure to Pholicious!  Good service, good food and super fresh.
And, for those people who want to sit and talk, met a friend there and we sat and talked for almost 3 hours without anyone bothering us.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Given the almost non-existent variety of pho options in the north Glendale/Phoenix area, Pholicious ranks above many (ahem Avina- vomit) to fulfill your hungover cure of beef noodle broth cravings.

The restaurant is clean, the service is fast, and the food is slightly above average, it's not as disappointing as fellow reviewers claim it to be. Noodles are nicely al dente and the broth isn't as MSG-ed out or excessively oily like other places. Prices range from $6-10, a fair price to pay for their decent sized portions. I hear their duck pho is one of the best. Me? I've had the pho tai and was well satisfied. Stick with any the noodle soups and you'll be good to go (rice dishes are a little stingy).

An extra bonus: it's conveniently located across the street from Lee Lees for all your Asian shopping needs."}
{"text":"Wasn't too bad. First time having pho & I couldn't complain. Also got the coffee boba & it wasn't too good. The tapioca was weird."}
{"text":"I have never had Pho anywhere else, so my review doesn't compare this place to any other pho restaurant. 

I'm addicted to this place! I had pho for the first time a few months ago and I loved it at first taste! The environment is quiet and clean, the staff are always friendly, and the Pho is amazing. The coolest thing is, that they always have a good movie on, or one of the local sports teams playing on their two tv's. I try and come less than once per month, but that never happens.  If you're in the area and you love pho, then this is a must stop!!"}
{"text":"The space was previously a Verizon retailer. It's very cramped and with what little space they did have, it would be too small for more than 3 customers at a time. 

I decided to skip ordering pho this time around and just purchased lychee and mango bubble teas. The mango had a strange powder mix. (I know other pho joint uses powder mixes but this one in particular tasted off) The lychee is sweet as it should be but it tasted like a can of Yeo Lychee drink poured over crushed ice. Not as well blended as the mango which appeared to look like a real smoothie. 

Overall, it's okay. Not my go to choice but if you want bubble tea and willing to sacrifice just to get something cold, then why not? Just don't have too much expectations."}
{"text":"The prices were just right the broth was amazing in my pho, and it didn't cost me that much for extra noodles, and shrimp. I definitely will come back, and try their other dishes that sounded excellent as I went through their menu."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food. Especially good Pho. Luckily Pholicious has really good pho. Located on a corner of a strip mall,  Pholicious always clean and the staff friendly.  We always order Pho which is good and reasonably priced. Service has always good and the other menu items look good. Been here several times and will come back soon."}
{"text":"Decent pho restaurant. 

My first time at this place was during a cold rainy day with my sister.  We were very intrigued with the place and when we walked in it was quite busy. 

To make a long story short, their customer service was not up to par.  Like most experiences I've had at Vietnamese restaurants that are small and busy, they try to get you out as fast as they can which is normal.  So we don't mind how fast the service is but in this case, you barely got any attention. We had to ask them for a table and waited at least over 20 mins to get our order in, including our drinks.    Now, as for the food, my sister had the chicken pho and I had the pho tai (sliced steak).  Overall, good decent pho.  Broth was light, not extremely flavored but still ok and wasn't super oily which we both like.

Overall, it was a good enough to satisfy the craving since we are originally from California and it's far from home pho but definitely will try another time."}
{"text":"I had been going back to this place for a few months because the new owner/chef makes better food than the previous one.  But, that's about to change...  After a month-long out of town trip, I came back today and the food seems to be more expensive, the pho does not taste the same anymore, and they also messed up on the pho order.  When told about it, they didn't even attempt to fix it - there are missing items in my order and I got charged full price for it.  Definitely will switch back to Tan Thanh across the street for more or less the same food quality at a much better price."}
{"text":"The best Pho in Glendale/Peoria. Very reasonable prices and excellent menu selection!
4/5 stars being that the communication is still a bit difficult at times between guests and staff"}
{"text":"5 stars for AZ that is :)

Best Pho restaurant I found  while visiting...hands down...Place is great, customer service is excellent and their spring rolls are amazing :)

Super stoked to fly out to visit family and have this only a couple miles from their home :)

I shall return next time I'm in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Looked at menu and decided to get bubble tea smoothies. Listed as one of the options for smoothie was Vietnamese coffee flavor. So I ordered Vietnamese coffee smoothie. I inquired at least three times to make sure this was a smoothie. My husband ordered the blueberry smoothie and wanted blueberry popping pearls. We verified that it would come with blueberry flavored popping pearls. When we received our drinks mine was not a smoothie but a cup filled with ice all the way to the top and filled with maybe 4 ounces of coffee. My husbands blueberry smoothie was not blended all the way and had huge chunks of ice and strawberry flavored pearls because they ran out of blueberry and failed to tell us. This is a terrible first experience and unfortunately for them we will not be returning. I will stick to going to places like Yoghut"}
{"text":"I have to say you can't go wrong with Phö, but you definitely can't go wrong with XL size Phö! We love our Phö spicy, flavorful, with fresh ingredients and Pholicious was on point. My daughter got the beef and flank and I ordered the #55 beef brisket Phö. The broth didn't need my help I could've had it as served. Lots of flavors that hit the spot. My wife ordered a beef and broccoli dinner and I must say the immediate smell was awesome. I personally do not enjoy most Asian cuisine due to harshness on my stomach. However I tried her plate and I was very surprised. The beef taste great not chewy and wasn't oily like most places. The fresh garlic, cilantro  and broccoli was flavor popping and of course fresh cooked rice is always good! 

Oh and don't forget the Thai tea. Delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"nem nuong cuon and mi dac biet.. order those, and be happy.

nem nuong cuon: is a spring roll with grilled pork, one of my favs that they do an excellent job of preparing here, make sure you ask for the sauce.

mi dac biet: an egg noodle soup with all the fixin's amazing

also try the vietnamese iced coffee.. it will not disappoint"}
{"text":"The food is all decently priced. The pho portions are huge and delicious. I would recommend the combo pho and the mango boba! The staff is friendly and the place is over all clean. It's a four star this time because some of the meat had hard pieces in it which I had not previously experienced here."}
{"text":"I had the regular size beef pho, maybe three cups or so. It was more than adequate for a mid-day snack. Taste was a bit salty, and I had to add a some things to make the spice to my liking, but it was good. The service was very good.  They have tables, but also seats at the \"bar.\""}
{"text":"This place is in the food court of the mall. It is not a restaurant type setting, adjust your expectations on that ahead of time and you will see that this place is great. Food tastes great and staff is nice. Price is about right."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went here for the first time. It was really good. When we were dating we went to a few places in the east valley and were looking for some good pho and we think we found our place in the NW valley. We tried Nam Sao, but did not care for their pho; and Pho Avina was closed when we went on Sunday. This is across the street from the oriental market we go to each week so we plan on going again.

My first impressions are how much fresh vegetables are in the broth when they bring the bowl to you and the smell of the broth. Both passed my eye and nose test right off. Good amount of green onion, white onion, and cilantro already in the bowl, and the meat was still pink when it came to the table. The broth had good flavor before adding any condiments. We both had the rare beef and meat balls. After adding the basil, bean sprouts, lime and hot sauce we dug in and we really enjoyed our meal. We plan on going some time for lunch so we can also try their coffee.

I would recommend Pholicious if you are on the NW side of town and looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"This was my go to Vietnamese restaurant for pho and rice plates not because it's my favorite but because of convenience. Pho Avina is closer to me but that place is terrible so I end up going to this place. It also helps that LeeLee Supermarket is one street over so I get a Viet fix and my Asian needs shopping in one trip. The pho and com tam is average. The service is fast and friendly enough. I do find it a big stingy that they don't bring out the bowl of broth/soup before you get your rice plate unless you ask for it. 

All in all this place is fine if you just want an average meal; nothing to rave about here. If I felt like driving farther, I'd definitely hit up Pho Van in Chandler for pho or Com Tam Thuan Kieu in Mesa for com tam."}
{"text":"Haven't found \"magnificent\" Pho in the PHX area yet, Pholicious has a very descent pho with great pricing, excellent service from what seems to be a family owned restaurant. Haven't had a bad experience at this place yet."}
{"text":"I must say this was a weird experience coming here. We walk into the restaurant listening to Jump Street 21 with them cussing and everything. We sat down ordered our food and drinks (raspberry iced tea and Thai tea). We got our spring rolls out then waited for the food. As we are continuing to wait for our food we are still waiting for our drinks. So I finally get up to ask the guy where our drinks are, he states that they are out of raspberry iced tea and that the Thai tea is being made (after 20 minutes of waiting). They were too busy watching 21 Jump Street then being on customer service. Once we get our food they bring the drinks, the soda had a bug in it and the Thai tea was really nasty, not sweet, no ice and not that much boboa. This was the first and last time that I would ever visit this place. The nice thing was that the flavor of the Pho was good but the service was crap!!!"}
{"text":"They tried so hard to be modern and chic and...and well they just failed. The neon lights, non-matching granite and marble, bad sky mural on ceiling, two flat screens on opposite walls on different channels with the volume up on low but loud enough to be heard no matter where in the restaurant you sat.
The servers were not friendly. They weren't rude or anything there just wasn't a sense of welcomeness.
The food was pretty good, but the shrimp was just ever so slightly over cooked. But everything was pretty flavorful."}
{"text":"Pho and taro boba was really good (I got pho with rare beef) just small portions and only one size.  older man came to check on us and see how we were doing, which was nice.  The only bad thing was he had some young girl which I assume was his daughter on the register and she added up wrong and over charged us and then took our card again and double charged us.  They voided the over charge but it won't go back on our card for a couple days.  My kids got orange chicken which they didn't like and wouldn't eat it.  I suggest paying cash there and not getting orange chicken.  I think his business would do better if he hired someone good with people or didn't have the kids there running it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Pho and Thai iced tea, everything was fresh and well made. A little bit of a language barrier with the wait the wait staff but the menu is easy to order off of. The place itself is quiet than most with a TV on playing a movie channel (Ted 2 was on at the time). Would eat here again, a local gem!"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix, this place is acids the street fro LeiLei's and hidden from view. Don't miss it. Try the chicken wings and especially the grapes leaves. The staff are very nice. The ambiance is wanting and music dated, but this is a must."}
{"text":"First time having Pho! The staff was friendly and helpful! I ordered to-go. Everything was delicious and came with all the traditional sides/garnishes. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We want to try out this restaurant for the first time. We try the shrimp roll and banh mi. Shrimp roll was good. Banh mi wasn't good at all. Have to give 3 star's just for that. But customer service was great..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite go to places ... the broth smelled old but was good kinda ... had a really horrible smell but the boba tea was good. I wouldn't want to go there again tho"}
{"text":"Comfortably decorated. Not foo foo but well coordinated. 40 chairs. Ordered number 14 pho beef noodle. Asked for two bowls. The pho bowl may have held 1 half gallon. I also ordered a jackfruit smoothie with bona. Restrooms were clean. Prices were great."}
{"text":"Most flavorful Pho in town. The vegetable and tofu Pho is excellent. Lunch specials M -F."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bay Area where we have some very great Vietnamese joints so I'm kinda bias when it comes to other places.  We went there for brunch on a Monday and there was just one other table eating pho. 

The pho broth was good.  The spring (fresh) rolls were average.  The wrapper could have been softer.  The coffee was nice and strong and they make it for you at the counter so none of that fresh drip at your table.  

Overall, the place is clean.  The food was good, but one minus on them was that they are a bit on the pricier side!  If I'm back in town, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pho?  In a mall??  How could this be???  This is the real deal, trust me here. 

This was a great experience.  They aren't in the food court like you'd expect, and are tucked away in the center at the bottom level.  They have a bar and tables, incredibly friendly service, and the pho was exactly what I needed amidst hectic holiday shopping on a freezing Ohio day.  I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"I love their Boba (Bubble Tea), especially the Thai Tea and Vietnamese Coffee but they also have Vietnamese Noodles."}
{"text":"I want to make it clear that this was my first time eating Pho. Despite having nothing to reference it to, the food was very good and I had a very enjoyable first experience. 

There were so many options and additions available you would be hard pressed not to enjoy it. My rating will be four stars because I can't knock them points for my lack of experience and I don't feel I can award five stars because I have nothing to compare it to. 

Due to my lack of knowledge I photographed everything. Please use the photographs as a wa"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the owner is the most unfriendly person ever.  Never greets you, never smile.  Blah to you too.  


Pho was ok

Vermicelli plates didn't smell too good.  Not sure what it is."}
{"text":"Pho in a mall?? What the heck? I was intrigued, since I've never heard of such a concept before.  So I decided to try it.  They don't have much of a selection, since the stall is small, but they focus on pho, boba drinks, and appetizer rolls.  Their goi cuon is freshly made in front of you, so it's pretty good.  The drinks were pretty good though, but I couldn't really taste the mint in the my mint tea boba.  The pho comes in several varieties, but no pho special.  Each pho bowl comes in two sizes, small or large.  Large is the size of a regular bowl at any pho restaurant, and small is about 3/5 the size of a large.  You don't get much in the way of veggies for you pho, but it's only a stall so it's no biggie.  My only complaint with the pho is that there's no \"marriage\" of flavors between the noodles and the broth.  If you eat pho a lot you would know what I mean.  The noodles taste like noodles, and the broth taste like broth.  The noodles aren't soaked wit hte flavor of the broth.  But it's a stall, so I'm not really complaining.  If it was a restaurant, this would be a problem.  Overall, it's a pleasant experience.  They have mints for after your meal and punch cards for a 10th meal free.  I'll be back, but I won't go out of my way.  It's 4 stars for a stall, but 3 stars if this was a restaurant."}
{"text":"Do not order the spring rolls. The pork in it tastes and feels like cardboard. The other spring rolls have a very gritty aftertaste. To me it looked like kitty litter. It pho was ok, but overall it was very disappointing. The whole bill was overpriced for the crappy food. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Oddly, this is a fast food place in the middle of the mall on the first floor (not in the food court like you would expect). They have their own seating which is nice to not have to fight the crowd on a Saturday afternoon.

We ordered the beef and beef meatballs pho, shrimp and chicken pho, spring rolls (which should really be called summer rolls as spring rolls are fried and summer rolls have the soft rice paper). Everything was quite tasty shockingly for coming out within 10 minutes. Tip: fresh Thai basil is free upon request.

The downside to this place is the price and portions. I understand that being in a suburb, pho is hard to find. However, also being \"mall fast food\", I wouldn't consider the ambiance/environment gourmet either. For 7ish dollars for regular size pho and 8ish dollars for a large bowl, the portions were very small for pho. Regular was like an American size soup bowl and the large bowl was like a pho regular/small size bowl at other places. The summer rolls were almost $6 for only 2 and almost $5 for the Thai ice bubble tea. Overall, this lunch for 2 came to over $33!  Pretty unheard of for a Vietnamese place. However, it is nice to see a Pho place in the suburbs."}
{"text":"If you're in the need for a \"pho-fix\" then this place isn't bad to stop in to. I am a big fan of pho, and it is a great food to eat for anytime of the year. Pholicious gives you one standard size of pho... It comes in a big bowl (which is fine by me - the more the better) but the both isn't as savory as I expect it to be. Pho is a very savory, smooth, tasteful broth that has hints of bone marrow and is amazing, but I just taste regular beef broth in this. They also keep all of their silverware piled together in a container at the end of the table, so it is safe to say that other people's hands have most likely touched your soup spoons before you have. They also give you wooden chopsticks to use, which are pretty weak and the moisture from the pho causes little pieces of wood to fall off into your soup. The staff is very friendly, and the food is out pretty fast. The prices are amazing!! Like I said, I only stop here if we are further away from other pho places, but it's not terrible.... Just mediocre."}
{"text":"I am on the most ridiculous diet and they cater to my strange requests. Super friendly staff and top notch food!"}
{"text":"Here right now eating rice noodles with grilled pork and egg roll. The pork must be old because it tastes awful, has a funky smell to it. It tastes like old meat, could very well be since they close in about an hour and this is left over meat? What a disappointment and waste of money. I should have ordered my usual but wanted to try something new. What happens."}
{"text":"A solid Vietnamese joint. Period.  Its not the most authentic but it gets the job done!

Why you should be eating here:

x Pho Dac Biet: clean and balanced, beefy broth, meat and noodle portions are just right (fresh veggies + lime)

x Bun Bo Hue: good, tasty broth, well cooked meat, good portion on noodles, sadly bone-in pork and pork blood were not provided but still enjoyable without! (fresh veggies + lime)

x Vermicelli: Excellent portion, nicely cooked meat and shrimp, tasty fish sauce, egg roll pieces were crisped and cut to fit bowl (fresh veggies)

x Chicken Wings in Butter Sauce: Served crispy and hot, very tasty

x Ban Xeo: Crispy shell/batter, good, tasty pork/sprouts filling!

Service is pretty typical of any other Viet joint except this place is a tad friendlier, actually! Warm welcome and refills water when low.

Viet music played in the background, LCD TV will have something playing.  Decor is very clean and modern.

For the most part this place is really straight forward, no mixed messages or dramas.  Sit down, order, eat, and bounce!"}
