{"text":"My family and I love this place best diner around. We have been going here for a few years. Consistently good food, ample portions and great prices. They use their own roasted turkey on the club sandwich and loads of bacon with breakfast platters. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Decor is a bit dated, but it is clean, with plenty of tables. I had the mushroom omelet with the home potatoes and rye bread. The mushroom omelet was a bit bland, but they use a lot of thick mushroom slices, which I like. The potatoes were fantastic, not greasy as they can sometimes be. My partner had the Eggs Benny, which was the best he has \"ever tasted,\" especially the Hollandaise. My 8 y.o. stepdaughter had the pancakes and peameal back bacon. The pancakes were large and fluffy and the back bacon was thickly cut and properly cooked. Two thumbs up all around. Three meals with two coffees and a chocolate milk came out to about $40, not including tip. The main complaint I have, hence taking off one star, is with the inconsistent service. We were warmly greeted and quickly seated, but were asked if we were ready to order barely after we sat down- we were not ready. Then we had to wait for a good 10-15 minutes to order, and we were not offered a coffee top up until after we had finished eating. The waitress placed the bill in front of my partner and thanked him as we were leaving, although I paid for the meal.  We are well into the 21st century- it would be nice if the wait staff caught up on that point. Otherwise, we'd highly recommend the breakfast here."}
{"text":"A well-runned greasy spoon with a steady flow of customers. We came here around 11:30 on a Sunday morning. The place was packed. Luckily, people were leaving as we came in so our wait was not too long. There was a line forming as we were seated. 

We ordered the Eggs Benedict with peameal bacon and the clubhouse sandwich. Both were great! The Eggs Benedict was loaded with peameal as well as Hollandaise sauce. It was delicious but maybe ask for sauce on the side if you are not a saucy person, like my girlfriend. It came with home fries which were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The clubhouse was definitely one of the best I've had. There was a generous amount of sliced turkey breast and bacon. Each bite was perfect. It also came loaded with French fries. 

The service was good. Great portions. A meal for two will run you about $30 after tax/tip. We will definitely be coming back to The Gingerman!"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend as I have been for many years. The service quality has gone down hill since the new owners took over early early this year. 

I got the Peameal Bacon and Eggs (Scrambled) with white toast and was somewhat disappointed. The potatoes were under cooked, the peameal was burnt and the toast had enough butter to make it inedible (it was massive globs so thick it would not melt). 

As I said to my folks I was not happy at all with the quality of the food this time around. The prices have gone up substantially since the new owners took over and the quality of the food has gone down. It is now all about how much money they can make rather than how good the food is. 

May not be back here for awhile."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp and went for breakfast. Not only was the staff very friendly, the food was amazing. I had bacon and eggs and my boyfriend had eggs Benedict. We'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Generous and tasty portions.   Definitely a local hot spot worth tying.    Company wasn't too bad either !  :)"}
{"text":"They have pancakes the size of my boyfriend's head, which is pretty awesome for pancake lovers. 
Their breakfast portions are great for the price and completely satisfies any breakfast cravings. Highly recommended! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great! I went for breakfast and was not disappointed - good value for money and portions."}
{"text":"This is an awesome greasy spoon diner. It has a family-run feel, with excellent service, with welcoming environment. I had their breakfast with peameal bacon, which was DELICIOUS! Their home fries are well seasoned, made with good soft potatoes, and not fried! I also had some french toast, which was decent, but it could have used some cinnamon and brown sugar. I would definitely go back for some all-day breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem in a somewhat shitty area of the city. 
The food is excellent and the prices are very reasonable. It's in a little strip mall beside an apartment building on Victoria Park Avenue, south of St. Clair.

We had two breakfasts (bacon, eggs, home fries toast and coffee) all for under 25 bucks! The home fries were so freaking delicious- made with REAL potatoes!, and the eggs were cooked just the way we asked.

Service was good. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the seats are a little too close together. You can hear everyone esle's convos, even if you don't want to.

Go here for a nice lazy weekend (or weekday!) breakfast. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is my new breakfast go to place. I love breakfast but most places the food is really greasy... not this place! Definitely get the sausage, I don't know why but it's seriously the best sausage!"}
{"text":"Exactly what we were looking for! Breakfast at noon that was fast and filling. Service was ok - friendly when she remembered to check in on us. Huge portions. Show up hungry."}
{"text":"Came here first time today based on reviews.  All I can say is Wow.  Breakfast isn't rocket science, but I have no complaints!  The home fries were actually proper, i.e. grilled and not deep-fried.  The eggs over easy were totally greaseless and gorgeous, the sausages and bacon done just as I ordered, and I've never left behind so much food at breakfast before.  Move over Sunshine Spot, I've got a new go-to brekkie utopia now, try it!"}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighbourhood for almost 20 years, but I only recently found out about this restaurant. It's located in a rather run down looking strip mall near the intersection of Victoria Park and St. Clair Ave. E. by which I have driven by countless times, but never paid much attention to.

This place is great. Very large portions! Great prices! Super friendly staff, yummy food, and it's well organized and efficient. It's also always full, but I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table (we're 2 ppl though).

I've been there twice so far: first time I had the sampler and I requested no ham, so instead they gave me a large amount of bacon to make up for it. A very nice surprise! The bacon was crispy, the home fries were delicious, the pancake was humongous, but not very tasty unfortunately. It was way too doughy.  

The second time I ordered the Greek omelette and asked to have onions added to it. Waited almost 25 minutes for it while people around us who had ordered after us were getting their food. Was very annoyed, until I got the omelette and it all melted away. It was very good, with lots of feta cheese, no skimping on their part. 

Love that you pay on your way out and that they take debit/credit cards. Staff are awesome, great atmosphere. I was a fool in waiting this long."}
{"text":"Very tasty western sandwich! The sandwich is huge! It was takeout but the service at the counter were warm, friendly and very inviting! The service is simply amazing! The brother and sister always have such a way to make me feel like a valued customer."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service! 
Kinda far drive for me, but I love their breakfast. 
I've had the Eggs Benedict a few times and always great!"}
{"text":"I love this greasy spoon!  The steady flow of customers ow proof that you can't judge a book by its cover.   I do judge the eggs Benny and they are incredible!"}
{"text":"Solid place, good portions, good quality, good staff. I usually get the peameal bacon. Pretty big place, pretty clean, I never had dinner but like I said the Breakfast is solid."}
{"text":"If you can be IN LOVE with a diner, then I am hopelessly head over heels!! Even though this place looks like nothing from the outside, as soon as you walk in the door you can feel it's warm and friendly charm. Service was friendly but it felt genuine and not over-the-top-fake-friendly you get in a lot of places. I ordered the French Toast without sugar and cinnamon (because I like it savoury) and was told \"that's how we do it here\". Ok, cool! Then I ordered a side of sausages well done (because I like it crispy on the outside) and was told \"that's how we do it here\". Swoon!! Portions were generously sized, too, and the coffee comes in a mug. My only complaint is that this place isn't closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Good greasy spoon place in the neighbourhood, so if you are not looking to venture out of your neighbourhood for brunch, this is it.   Good portions, right amount of grease on their eggs, toast, and everything else."}
{"text":"Mother's Day today, probably a very bad day to come here but my friend highly recommend this place and I don't have a lot of free time available.  The place was packed with a lineup of two other parties ahead of me and two behind me.  My wait was only 10 minutes; party of one has it's benefits.
 
My all-day breakfast choice was the 3 eggs with house cut (half pound) peameal bacon with hand cut home fried potatoes and thick Texas toast for $10.25 and coffee for $2.00 extra.

Staff was courteous and one took my order while another (runner) brought me my java; team approach.

The decor reminds me of my parents restaurant growing up with one noticeable difference; this place has inspirational pictures lining the walls.  The full service menu was also similar with so many food choices for patrons of all ages with many of them in their 50's...with grandkids in tow.  I noted that the bathrooms are downstairs.

My coffee cup was readily refilled by a server walking about.  Sweet!

The breakfast was excellent, especially the 3 large pieces of peameal bacon.  Service was also excellent!

My friend was right...for once!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but my server had a terrible service day.  She came by to take my order before I had ever gotten a menu.. then forgot to give me a menu.. I asked for it.. eventually I just grabbed one of another table.

Only got my coffee refilled once.  Asked twice for it.. then wasn't given sugar.

Asked for the bill, again, had to ask for it twice.

I know.. it was Sunday breakfast service and it was busier than Donald Trump Jr meeting with the Russians.. and I honestly felt slightly bad.. but mostly annoyed."}
{"text":"As other reviews said,  it's a greasy spoon.  The food arrived promptly and there was plenty of it.  The grease and butter saturating the home fries,  eggs and toast left my stomach feeling a bit sick. .  Coffee was horrible.  If you're hungry and nearby,  it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service.  We had the breakfast special and coffee.  Good food,  good prices in a clean and neighbourly dining area.  We will have this place on our top list of breakfast restaurants to frequent!  After our second visit, I will see if it is consistently good and give it the 5 stars!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a few breakfast places and I'd hate to say it, this was the worst. I had the eggs Bennie at numerous places around Toronto and was surprised at how awful the hollandaise sauce was. I don't think it was hollandaise sauce. More like warmed yellow mayonnaise. And the home fries had no flavour. No seasoning what's so ever! The best part was the staff. They were fantastic! But the food...smh!"}
{"text":"Very cozy feeling place that gives a retro 80s feeling - clean and spacious.  Service is polite, efficient and warm.  Prices are reasonable.  

Food is good, portions are generous and very good service.  Water was refilled without asking.  You can tell the staff is very hardworking.  Would definitely recommend!

Easy 4 stars."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Scarborough and lived/studied/worked downtown, I can say this is one of the great greasy spoons of the GTA, possibly the best in Scarborough. Simple and tasty, decent pricing, and awesome service.

My friend and I both got eggs bennie with peameal bacon, and all aspects of the dish - potatoes, poached eggs and the hollandaise (though I detected some margarine in the sauce, not sure if that is the best sub for butter in this case) - were delicious. 

Service was really friendly, and you know it's a good sign when your coffee is refilled at least a couple times, but they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps another server on the weekends is due?

Last, prices were great, super reasonable. Overall, a great little place I will recommend to anyone looking for brunch in Scarbs. We need more places like this in the East end."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and lots of breakfast options in a diner style resto. Ordered the typical breakfast: came with 4 sausages, 3 eggs, fluffy toast and yummy potatoes. Much more preferred than a franchise breakfast joint. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"A Saturday morning and not to crowded nice. Excellent place for someone who craves a breakfast during the day, all day. 
  Portions are perfect and very tasty. May e not the best coffee I have had but the meal definitely made up for it. The bread used for toast was Texas style, which is a nice choice because you need the extra bread for the 3 eggs you are given. 
  I am not sure why I have not come here more often because I drive by it all the time, but will come back again soon.

Oh there is also parking out front so if your driving you should be good."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this breakfast place! Good service, good food and most importantly is cheap with giant portion. This is alwasy my go to place for breakfast. Is cheap and good"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since my original review and I've noticed that service quality can suffer when it's busy.  A guy who came in right after me was seated, had his order taken, and a full breakfast served to him by the time I was asked what I wanted to eat.

Sorry, Gingerman, but I have to knock a star off my original rating for that."}
{"text":"Customer service was amazing, Food was on point and tasty!!! 
Such nice welcoming feel, always made sure we were satisfied and happy with everything.

My toast was a little burnt and she even asked if I was okay with that (I secretly like things burnt so it was perfect for me) or the bacon I asked for to be extra crispy, when she brought it she made sure that was how I wanted it.
It was the little things that she asked or accommodated for us that made me feel really looked after. Very customer oriented and caring.

They even have variety of hot sauces!!!***
Pineapple, papaya, Tabasco and Franks red hot options :) big plus for us since we love sauces.

This cute friendly diner is definitely a place I'd come back to. Family feel and tasty food, I'll recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went here because of another's review on eggs benny...absolutely awesome!!  Great service, awesome family atmosphere and amazing breakfast!
Great portions and excellent value for the amount of food we got.
Food was cooked to perfection...VERY high on my eggs benny list!"}
{"text":"You cannot resist the charm of this diner. When you enter you are greeted by the waitress, the older gent who buses the tables and even the cooks way in the back. They know their regulars and their orders. The waitress even remembered where we sat last. They know their menu well and can give recommendations to suit your tastes. With this type of place you need to know what to order to make the most of your dining experience. The steak is always a winner, well seasoned and juicy. I would always choose their fries over their home fries because it comes out piping hot and crispy. Egg sandwiches with cheese are also a solid choice. Breakfast served all day assures that we'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is place is Awesome, all day Breakfast at a good price...  Supper Friendly staff.  This is a place that you can become a regular!"}
{"text":"I found the Gingerman on Yelp. I was looking for an early breakfast and 7am was perfect. I had the Spanish omelet and my sis had bacon and eggs. Much enjoyed by both of us. Service was great and friendly. I will remember this gem."}
{"text":"Family run hole in the wall with great breakfast. My kids are known by name and the atmosphere is very welcoming.

The decor could use an updating but at those prices and efficiency why change."}
{"text":"My breakfast spot. Before I go grocery shopping I need to eat here first so that I don't have to buy so much groceries. Cheap but it will hit the spot . I go every two weeks and it has become my routine. Everybody needs a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Nice greasy spoon 

My rating is actually 4.99999999 out of 5

Went there and had the 3 eggs and bacon with potatoes and bread with coffee (extra $1.70)

It was delicious and great friendly service. 

The bacon was thick and long (4 pieces). Eggs were good and cooked perfect

Only complaint (the 0.000001) -total after tax and 17% tip was $15 --- little too much for me lol but that's maybe more of my current cheapness. I'm used to $10 after tax and tip at similar type places --- but I would still come back with a smile"}
{"text":"First timer at The Gingerman but won't be my last!
I can eat breakfast for morning, lunch & dinner... The simple combination of eggs over easy, pork sausages, home fries & toast just can't be beat and this hidden gem does it justice! Generous portions and everything cooked to perfection! 

The only thing better than the food was the friendly service. I didn't get the server's name but she was fantastic. I order my food to go and while waiting she offered even me a paper to read.. That has never happened to me before!

The place is small, clean and cosy. I will definitely be back and suggest you give this place a try even if you're not in the immediate area. Don't let the slightly dated run down strip mall scare you off!

PS. I ate my breakfast before I thought to take a photo... But my friend has the Filet of sole special and said it was decent. The fish came with soup and rice pudding, it was one of the specials of the day."}
{"text":"Earlier today my bestfriend and I tried this place for the first time. We live in the area and for some reason we never knew of this restaurant. From the outside and the surrounding area, you wouldn't think that there's actually a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. The signage was very simple with the word \"restaurant\" clearly visible and \"ginger man\" that is so little under it. Coming in, the restaurant is clean and well lit. I ordered their ginger man sampler from their all day breakfast menu, which consists of ham, bacon, sausage, three eggs and pancakes instead of French toast. Before tax it was 11.5, and I think that for the taste of the food and the quantity, the price is pretty cheap. My bestfriend and I really enjoyed our brunch and will definitely recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"my new go to place for brunch! Conveniently located near nofrills. The food is very filling and their potatoes are great! bottomless coffee and great service. They have tables for 2&4 so come in 2s if you want to get seated sooner. 

Washrooms: Located downstairs. One stall and one urinal in the male washroom 

Edit: you pay on your way out"}
{"text":"This place is the perfect breakfast diner. It's your typical neighborhood restaurant, where everyone seems to know each other. That to me is always a good sign. The cooks in the back are older men, who look like they've been doing it their whole lives, and it shows in the quality of the food! I've been here twice for breakfast, both times I ordered the bacon and eggs. You get 3 large eggs, 4 thick slices bacon, a good quantity of fresh made home fries, 2 Texas cut toast, tomatoes and a slice of orange, all for $5.75!! The service is fast and super friendly. I have also heard that their dinner specials are really affordable and well prepared. I will definitely be back to try them out!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for 30 years best greasy spoon in town. Prices are great, amazing breakfast and great burgers. Most of the waitresses are super friendly. I highly recommend it"}
