{"text":"This place is amazing!! We are hugely critical of our food (almost to a fault), but we had absolutely no complaints with this place! Service and ambience was great and you can't beat the prices. Perfect place for an amazing lunch."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Thai food many years ago when I was in Paris and this Thai restaurant definitely satisfies my cravings! I always get the thai basil beef medium spice with brown rice and every time I eat it I melt. It is so delicious!  This is the kind of place that you go when you just want to have a nice relaxing meal. I stop at Fresh n Easy and grab a 3.99 bottle of Big Kahuna red wine and head over to Osha. They charge $1 corking fee and bring out some glasses (usually mismatched but that adds charm to it for sure!) It's a great family owned Thai restaurant where they're always friendly and the food always tastes yummy! One tip though, if you're making a special trip out there you should call ahead, it's not uncommon for them to close for a few weeks to go back to Thailand!"}
{"text":"Not much on decor, which is cool because we're eating Asian country food.  Besides, I don't need a giant iron horse watching me eat and a psuedo-Haan Dynasty tapestry overhead with flecks of hoisin like that big chain Chinese restaurant.  I love Osha.  Why?  They're serving Thai food.  Not Thai-fusion, not \"Yeah, we have a Thai name, but we're really just basic stir fry like the restaurant that closed up at Desert Ridge\",  but Thai.  You want Panang?  They have it.  Mussaman?  They have it.  Green curry?  Yup.  All of the Thai basics are here along with your assortment of meats (and tofu for the wifey).  If you want it hot, you're going to get it hot.  That's why you came, right?  Not quite a \"date night\" style place, but if you're looking for unapologetic, unpretentious Thai cuisine, there's no place that comes even close in Scottsdale.  The hot pot soups are simply amazing as well.  Solid.  Solid.  Solid."}
{"text":"Excellent family style thai dining! 5/5 Osha Thai has been our favorite restaurant in the past year! This cozy and family-style restaurant never failed us everytime we dined there. They have very authetic thai food that is comparable to those in Thailand (I grew up with Thai food in Southeast Asia). They have everything from your typical pad thai, seafood somtum (green papaya salad) to gourmet cashew duck. The price is very reasonable with this kind of quality! Service always excellent!"}
{"text":"Small portions and the chicken smelled and was definitely off. Told the waitress and she did nothing. Expensive for the amount of food. There are better thai restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I'd give the food at Osha a 3.5, but the service was so friendly that I rounded them up..it's a nice, family-run neighborhood, authentic Thai restaurant. It has no atmosphere, as is the case with most Thai places, and the place was empty on the night we went, but they put out some very good food. However, I think the food at Thai House, at Frank Lloyd Wright and Hayden, is just as good and about $1 to $2 less per dish, so combined with their closer location to me, I don't see much reason to go back to Osha over Thai House."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I ordered the fish cakes (Tod Mun) appetizer, which was absolutely delicious, great flavor and not at all greasy like other versions I've had. The accompanying cucumber sauce was mostly cucumber - but my server quickly brought more of the sauce itself as soon as I asked. I asked for a recommendation between the Pad See Ew and the Pan fried noodles, and my server recommended the noodles - also delicious, with a generous amount of beef. The beef was thinly sliced, nicely seasoned, and very tender. The portion was very large and I expected to have leftovers, but it was so delicious, I finished it at the restaurant. Highly recommend this place, looking forward to returning and trying other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"After standing at the doorway for a few minutes, we were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted.  After perusing the menu, we decided to ask for recommendations of what is the most authentic on the menu.  Jan launched into Thai and the conversation rapidly took off onto a tangent about ice cream.  We finally got back to the food and was recommended these dishes:  - Pad Kee Mow ($10) - stir-fried wide rice noodles with variety of veg and basil - Pad Grapow ($10) - stir-fried onions, basil, bell pepper  - Arizona Heat Wave ($12) - interesting name for red curry  Each comes with choice of meat.  We picked beef and chicken.  We asked for both white and brown rice which are provided without additional charge - a nice touch. We asked for medium spicy and the seasoning was spot on. Good balance of salty, spicy and sweet which is what makes Thai food so addictive.  I also liked the amount of vegetables that come with each dish, although more than what is traditional, it seems more healthy.  The food was so tasty we had to ask for another round of rice.    Even though we live 5 min from Osha, we've been afraid to try it for fear of being disappointed since we cook pretty decent Thai food at home.  I'm glad we finally took the plunge and look forward to going back for the excellent Pad Kee Mow, in particular.  Note that Osha is family run so the service can be a bit laid-back which is, actually, very Thai.  (Please note that the restaurant will be close Feb 1-19 for a family trip back to Thailand, according to the signs posted on the walls.)"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant twice .  The food has been excellent both times and the service quick and attentive.  It is a small neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall-- well worth visiting.  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place. A little gem in a strip mall.  Not big on ambiance, but the food and service is very good.  Love their lunch specials. Take out service is available as well."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, quiet atmosphere. My go to place! Best thai in the area. The food is fresh and cooked to perfection. Spice levels are right on. Never had a bad dish. BYO makes it even better. It is a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited this place on 2011-07-14.  We happened to be in the neighbourhood and decided to give it a try.  The place is tucked away in a small strip mall.  Everything else in the mall was closed, but we bravely soldiered on.  Walking into the restaurant is like walking into the sitting room of someone's home, but with some extra tables and a couple of booths along one wall.  The decor was minimal, with just enough to let you know you were in a Thai restaurant.  However, it had all the warmth of the sitting room at your doctor's office.  Service was attentive; after all, we were only the second table seated that night (another table came in later).  Ordered the Thai tea to start.  Pretty standard fare... nothing special here. Ordered the chicken satay.  Portions is a little light, and I wished the chicken had a bit more of a sear on it to get some color.  Doused in curry and served with peanut sauce, it works, but certainly isn't the best I've ever had. Ordered the Arizona Heat Wave... I think they got the name wrong - where's the heat?  It was flavorful but was mostly vegetables.  Where's the beef?  Ordered the Pad Tai.   Pad Thai was good, but nothing to write home about.  I've had better traveling through Asia, but this was good for Phoenix.  Overall, the flavors were good, the portions were a bit small, the decor minimal, and the price a touch on the high side for mostly vegetables (someone else also mentioned they skimp on the meats - they were correct).  Would I return here?  If I was in the neighbourhood and felt like Thai food, then probably yes, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Somehow this unassuming place in a strip mall in Arizona is one of the better Thai restaurants I've been to.  I've been here numerous times, and each time the food is consistently delicious.  One of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever had, and most of the curries have had have also been quite good (save the Green Curry, of which I've had better)  Like most good Asian restaurants, you should come here for the food and not the decor/ambiance/service/whatever.  On my last visit the decor appeared to be in the process of being updated from it's previous hole-in-the-wall look, but wasn't quite there yet.  I've never had a problem with the service -- they're very friendly and efficient but they don't fall all over themselves for you either, which is fine with me.  I believe it's a family run operation, so keep that in mind.    It's not a high-end place, but if you're after good Thai food you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is great! You walk in to a cozy space with very friendly people to great you. I've been here several times with my large family and other times just grabbing take out. My favorite thing to order is their green curry. My mom always orders the Evil Jungle Princess which is very popular but a little too spicy for my taste. I'm kind of sensitive to really spicy food. However their curry has so much flavor and they incorporate many fresh vegetables in their dishes. Their thai tea is great too! mmmm..."}
{"text":"This is a really good Thai restaurant. The food was excellent. We ordered clear noodles, awesome. Pad Thai with shrimp was perfect. My kids had the chicken skewers with peanut dip and loved it. There were no left overs because we ate everything up. MMMMMM. I highly recommend. We will be back."}
{"text":"OSHA's new menu, which eliminated one of our longtime favorites, was a warning of other changes. Sadly, we and four guests were served several mediocre entrees that showed how OSHA has declined. Soggy and flavorless pineapple rice, \"off\" tasting pad Thai, a poorly made noodle dish were among our disappointments. Too bad, but there are other Thai restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Okay so I hate to write a review like this...but couldn't stop thinking about how awful our food was. I ordered some to go food and hoped it would become a new easy favorite for me and my bf but I was totally wrong.   my Thai iced tea was delicious and as I drove home with our food I figured that was a good sign, but much to my dismay I was duped. Our food was gross. It looked bad and tasted terrible. I love Thai food, we get it fairly regularly and there are some good spots around town but this place does not make the cut. Green curry tasted like it was old and from a few days ago. The spring rolls were dry and over stuffed with cabbage and not enough shrimp or other veggies. The noodle dishes were lack luster and the shrimp were the size of nickels. As we were cleaning up our partially eaten food we realized that it not only looked and tasted bad but the smell reminded us of canned dog food yuck!!  Thankfully we had no tummy aches from this meal, but we were a little nervous. :( wah wah"}
{"text":"This is a small Thai restaurant, cute decor and  standard service. The food is ok and every entree I have ordered is lacking in the protein category. If you are going to pay $13 for a hot pot of shrimp soup you would think it would have more than 6 small (not medium) shrimp in it.  Not sure how hard it is to keep a small restaurant open in N Scottsdale but shorting the customers to make your overhead doesn't seem like it would be worth it in the long run."}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood place!  It's not a fancy restaurant by any means, but it's clean and friendly, and best of all you can bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy.  This makes going out to eat much more affordable if you like wine with your food like we do.  We probably eat here 2 times a month at least, more if we are too busy or tired to cook.  We've had take out many times, and I've never been disappointed with anything.  It's not expensive at all, and always good.  Whenever I'm under the weather I pick up their tofu soup and I feel better instantly.  Their fried rice is excellent as well as their curries.  I love the spicy cashew dish too.  The bf always gets a noodle dish.  So good!  It doesn't seem as oily as Chinese food can be, plus their brown rice is so good.  The bf claims he likes white rice better, but always finishes my brown rice.  I'm so happy this place is close to my house.  The restaurant may seem empty, but they do a healthy amount of take out business.  Service is always very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good beef panang curry.  It has a complex flavor and the price is right.  Other dishes are tasty too.  Don't let the outside appearance scare you; Inside is simple and clean.  Service is laid-back, so be prepared to stay a little bit longer than you might at some sit-down places, but they'll work with you if you let them know you can't stay long."}
{"text":"Too many onions...I think it's their \"filler\". Uncomfortable booths. Mediocre service. Small portions. The 1 star is for the lovely water feature. Worst Thai I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace different to go to in the neighborhood.  I have driven by Osha Thai many times and decided to stop in.  Wow, am I glad we did!  Everything about this place is great. Great food, Great prices, Great Service.  We started out with chicken lettuce wraps and Mee Grab.  For our entree's we had Ginger (Pad Khing Sod) with chicken,  Spicy Cashew Beef and a noodle dish.  Everything was better than the next!    I'm looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"3 times in 2 weeks should tell you thy this place is stellar! I have had both the basil chicken and the garlic pepper chicken. They are both super tasty. If you like spicy I would go hot over medium. All of their meat and veggie are very fresh. Service is good and to-go orders are very fast. The place is small and cute inside. Best part, they have brown rice! Yummy. This place is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Wow... I had to share tonight's experience.... We stopped in to get some take out ...for the 30th time.... My wife told the owner about the terrible Chai Tea from the last time... Instead of giving her a $2 tea and saying \"Sorry\" she gave my wife a lesson on how precise the tea is always made! Then we both commented on the Lettuce Rolls when we got home... That's 99% of what was in there! Hmmmm ... Why was there one couple in your place for dinner at 7 pm on a Friday night?!?!? Thai House is lookin' a little closer to Fountain Hills from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food has great aroma and fresh taste. The beef and curry is excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Scottsdale, hands down. This hidden gem is amazing. The golden curry pockets appetizer is perfect (especially the Thai chili dipping sauce) but before that, lunch specials come with soup and a spring roll. A little mini bite of deliciousness. My daughter had the pad Thai with tofu...fantastic! I had the pineapple friend rice with chicken. Yum! Huge portions and great service. If you've never been here and love Thai food, visit this wonderful place soon!"}
{"text":"Was recommended last week to OSHA from an Apple Store manager in Scottsdale. Got here during lunch and was able to partake in the lunch special. We ordered cashew chicken, beef pad Thai and Thai iced tea. For hotness of the food, we only went to medium since we were unsure of the heat. You never know. For the record, the medium wasn't hot to us so we'll try hot next time. The Thai iced tea nice, sweet and refreshing. Food was presented nicely but portions on the smaller side (hardly any beef in the pad Thai) and so we didn't have leftovers to take home like we usually do.  As far as service, we had a nice lady waitress that served us and the food came out good and hot. So far this is one of the better Asian places we've tried in AZ."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place,  my boyfriend and I have had take out from here a bunch and have always enjoyed it.  It's a bit Americanized in the way that it isn't as spicy as I'd like but either way really satisfying."}
{"text":"Based on food, this place gets 5 stars. But that's not all that makes a restaurant.   The service can be pretty slow, but not to slow to make you wonder how many bowls they might be smoking in the back... So it's all good!  Osha Thai is BYOB, and that makes me very happy. There are not many spots like it  in the area.   You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, but the Pad Woonsen is killer! Spice that bad boy up and throw in some protein!  Come here looking for a great bite, and bring along a few bottles of wine to wash it down! You won't regret it (until the next day maybe?). Haha."}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai lunch special.  Inexpensive, and pick up ready when promised.  Perfect amount of spice. Will definitely be back to try other dishes, and maybe for dinner!"}
{"text":"Our meal was excellent from start to finish and even common meal components like the Thai iced tea and coconut ice cream were standouts.  The dishes were spiced accurately per our preferences (you can order mild, medium, hot and Thai hot) and delicious.  They were also authentic (yet presented in a very accessible way so those who have no experience with Thai food will also feel welcome here).  We ordered the Shu Mai appetizer and got fat, delightful little wontons stuffed with tasty filling and served with a yummy dipping sauce. We also ordered the Pad Prik Kring (green beans, curry paste, and crushed peanuts) and the Pad Kee Mow(wide noodles with a variety of vegetables), both with chicken.  The vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly crisp tender and the dishes were full of flavor. The service was attentive and judging from the amount of take out orders, this place has a growing and well deserved following in the neighborhood.  The restaurant is located in a nondescript strip mall and the decor is nothing special but the food is so special that you won't mind!"}
{"text":"This is Fantastic Thai food!!!  Delicious, Fresh, Clean even.  What I mean by \"Clean\"  is, Thai  food could potentially be a conductor for a lot of additional oil and unnecessary calories and I always appreciate and notice if a dish is prepared without the high gloss factor.   Hub and I both had stir fries; the chicken and vegetables in each dish were  excellent & we  both noted the preparation exclaiming in unison the tastiness of it all.    Don't expect award winning service here, it's a small business and while you might think they need an extra server to cater to all  your yelps;  I noticed the place was packed and then empty all within an hour.  Be patient.   Since I'm so patient with their service I wonder if they'd mind if I brought my own soda from home and busted out my refill from my purse when I needed it instead of waiting on them which could leave one parched beyond acceptance, that way its a win win."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I have ever had. I don't Normally write bad reviews. We started with pot stickers that were unevenly cooked. I got yellow curry that was tasteless. As advertised the brown rice is $2 extra. Waitress was nice. We should have turned around when we entered this empty restaurant at dinner time."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews on this place and I have been here quite a few times for lunch.  Certain things are always great, like the golden pockets, chicken lettuce wraps and the chicken satay!  They usually have great sauces in general; I think most of them are made in house (family owned restaurant).  I have had most of their curries and they are quite yummy, minus the few times it was overly salty!  The peanut dipping sauce with the chicken satay is awesome...Yum!    The 'meh' part of this restaurant:  The service- I think it has ALWAYS been slow and it is like pulling teeth to get a refill on anything.   Portion and Price- I know America does not need another restaurant that serves huge portions, but Osha Thai's portions are rather small and lacking in the meat department.  I guess at least you get lots of yummy sauce for your rice or noodles.  Vegetarians would probably really like this place :)    I will go back just because it is around the corner from my work, but I am not a huge fan in general.  However, I will always order the GOLDEN POCKETS! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"A family run business right around the corner, consistantly delicious, with great service. It does not serve alcohol so bring your own."}
{"text":"Another lovely mom and pop with fabulous authentic thai.  The prices are very reasonable and I've never had a problem with the service."}
{"text":"I do love Thai food so was pleased to finally get to the OSHA , and I wasn't disappointed. It was very good all round. The restaurant is quite small so do book if you can as it gets busy."}
{"text":"Talk about price performer. Great Thai and service at a real good price. Would eat here again in a heartbeat. For me I am a person who enjoys spice Thai. On a scale of 1-5, I pass those looking at Thai hot and country Thai hot. So on a scale of 1-5 I get it 7 and ask for a spice tray. Here they say 5 is Thai hot. So, I went with it. With my scale above their Thai hot was just a normal hot."}
{"text":"A surprising find for us!  The food is absolutely fantastic.  The service is fast, especially during lunch when we don't have a lot of time.  I order take out quite frequently and everything is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"So glad I stopped into this neighborhood joint to pick up a menu during my few months in The Valley.  What a delight!    I'm a sucker for small, family-owned Asian restaurants and can usually find good things to say about them all.  But I mean it when I say that I really liked this place.  Try the Arizona Heat Wave.  We also got a ginger stir fry dish which did not disappoint... because it was aromatic and rich with ginger -- the flavor certainly wasn't masked.  My minor complaint is that the takeout portions are a bit on the modest size for the price.  But that's okay, it was so good I just wanted to be a bit of a glutton.  The Tom Yum Soup was good, too -- but the chunks of chicken and veggies seemed sparse in the quart size container.  Then again, the broth was so fragrant, I would have been happy to sip on that alone.  Great place!  Go support them if you live anywhere in the vicinity."}
{"text":"I really don't know what the food is like. We were going to try it but the lady was rude when we walked in. We walked in at 10:55 and the place opens at 11. The \"open\" sign was turned on and the door was ajar. As soon as we walked in, the lady comes to me and said we are closed, come back at 11. I told her that it was 5 minutes from now, can we take a seat since we made a special trip to come and the sign did say open. She said \"no, come back at 11.\" The food might be great...but who knows? We only experienced the rude service."}
{"text":"I go here because it is close. Yet, if you're into Thai food, like I am, this is below standard. Cha da Thai is in the area and far better."}
{"text":"I was in the establishment the other day the woman there didn't understand a word I was speaking and treated me very rudely and was asking me if there was something wrong with myself you don't treat a customer like that specially one that's been coming to your place for over 10 years The customer service here is horrible I don't think it's the same owners that used to work here because I never would've been treated like this just a word of warning to anybody reading this go someplace else"}
{"text":"Osha serves excellent food and is just down the street from my apartment which is awesome because aside from the usual fast food chains there aren't a lot of great restaurants in the immediate area.  I have only ordered carry out and they've always had it ready in fifteen to twenty minutes.  I ordered the Tom Ka and Panang and while I prefer Thai House's panang, Osha's wasn't bad by any means.  Osha also has better hours as they are one of the only places open on Sunday."}
{"text":"I love the appetizers and often make a meal of them. The fresh spring rolls were beautifully prepared. Dipping them in the peanut sauce just enhanced their flavor. This time we ordered the crab puffs, which were full of cream cheese and paired with sweet n sour sauce.  We've eaten in before, but this time we did take out. Our order was ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Family owned ,been coming here for almost 4 years the food & service have gone downhill. Water glass has spots, crispy fish has spice but where is the crispy!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their curries-the staff is friendly and the food is always yummy.  Usually I do take out, but today I think I will go in for a sit down meal-review to be updated soon!"}
{"text":"Lovely place! I lived in Thailand so Im quite picky with Thai restaurants. This one is up to my standard.Ive vidited it several time and never felt disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a nice low-key dinner that will also be my lunch for tomorrow. The atmosphere and service were nothing special but the food was good.   Most entrees cost around $10 including your choice of meat or tofu, or you can get shrimp for like $2 extra.    I had the Pad Thai with chicken.  It was a huge amount of food and had a really nice flavor.  The chicken was all white meat as promised but was kinda tough (probably a little over-cooked).  Next time I'll go with the tofu.  My friend's bright neon orange Evil Jungle Princess looked a bit radioactive but she said it was really good.  We both thought the 'medium' spice was just right."}
{"text":"Ok. Just ordered dinner to go and it was ALL wrong!  Spent $12 on a curry chicken and there was tiny little pieces of thinned out chicken, total waste of money, seriously, there was NO chicken in this dish. I am SO disappointed. We also ordered Thai toast only to get some fried corn patty. It also seems they increased their prices. We did call and the lady who answered said that I ordered these corn patties and I said, \"I have no idea what these corn patties are let alone the name of it to order it\". Uggg.   I'd rather go to Thai House which is further away to get Thai food - their portions are well worth the money there.  Sorry Osha!"}
{"text":"I am a huge thai food fan and typically I am pleased with just about anything. I had take out from here and made an attempt to have a friend try thai food for the first time. I figured it would be a good spot to order some of the classics from. Sadly the food was not very good at all and I think I have officially caused someone who was willing to try something new in terms of food to really hate the idea of trying anything outside of the norm. I tried to explain it wasn't that good but now they are convinced they must not like Thai food. Big bummer."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to OSHA once or twice a week.  The food is fresh and delicious and the service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"First time here but the food was pretty good.  I asked for mild but there was a hint of spice after the food hit my tongue for about a minute or so.  Guess you can't have curry without it being hot.  Service was quick, we called ahead with our order and in 15minutes it was ready.  The takeout order was packed nicely with utensils and napkins enclosed.  We ordered a noodle dish which was very tasty and the noodles cooked just right!  The tofu was a little overdone so maybe I'll get fresh tofu next time instead of fried.  There wasn't enough tofu on the order though, it was like they were skimping..."}
{"text":"I arrived as soon as they opened on Saturday. It was very quiet and only one other person was there with me waiting on a to-go order.  The woman up front greeted me and seated me, then shortly after I had a chance to go over the menu, she came back and took my order. I didn't wait too long for my food, and it was delicious! The portion was large; I had enough left over for a to-go box.   I'd definitely come back! Their menu was laid out in an organized way and i found it esthetically pleasing to the eye... not that I'm basing my review based on how organized their menu is. :)  Good food! Good location. Good prices."}
{"text":"Review is for the Pad Thai Lunch. Very small restaurant. The pad thai lunch cost $7 but is a relatively small portion, but not horrible for the price. The issue is they fill half the plate with sprouts instead of pad thai. 3 stars because the pad thai was about average, lacked much flavor because it was pretty much noodles and sauce. Not enough egg and green onions and no tofu when unless you choose tofu instead of a meat."}
{"text":"Finally a thai restaurant offers real Thai spicy. The food was decent. However, i didn't like the fact that they charged me $1 for a tiny bowl of broth (just plain broth, no meat or anything in it)..."}
{"text":"I love how quick and easy it is to order good to go and their thai iced tea is delicious and refreshing. I love the shrimp pad thai, but really everything is delicious. I will continue to return. They're also always quick and efficient with orders, never gotten mine wrong once."}
{"text":"The best Thai food i ever had. i have been going since it open,tastes never change. Great service, water always refill my glass never empty. Owner handsome and hella kind. Must go guys.'  THE BEST THAI FOOD '"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Delicious curries and cute decor, and it's BYOB which is pretty rare around here. Service has always been good, and prices are pretty reasonable for their spicy and satisfying dishes. Thanks Osha :)"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Osha for over a year now and just realized that I have never written a review for them.  I have had many of their dishes, both dine in and take out.  I've enjoyed everything I have ever ordered.  The ambiance inside the restaurant is nothing to get excited about, but the food is good."}
{"text":"The food and service is always top quality at this little Thai restaurant.  They have the best Thai iced coffee and with their spice levels I always find exactly what I want for flavor.  The prices are really quite low, making Osha Thai one of the more economical lunch options.  I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"There's an Osha Thai back home in SF that is really good and I've heard great raves about this place from my co-workers who claim to be \"thai food snobs\". Took my sister here and we love thai food and are relatively easy to please at restaurants as well as pretty patient. This place just reopened today after closing for a quick remodel, so maybe being closed for a couple of weeks has made them forget how to give good customer service.   There were two other guests that came in, who were obviously regulars,  and despite ordering after us by at least 5 minutes, they got their food about 20 minutes before us! Actually I stand corrected, they finished their food before we even got started on our appetizers! We ordered crispy tofu, shrimp pad thai, and fried tofu pad see ew.  The crispy tofu took about 20 minutes to come out, then after that, we waited at least another 20 minutes before being told our food would be out soon. Two people had come in during that time and placed togo orders, to which they got to pick up and leave by the time we got close to getting our food.   Then the food came out and all we could smell was something burning. The pad thai looked and tasted pretty great, but my pad see ew was burned and there were pieces of charred tofu and rice noodles, which were conveniently buried under the pile of broccoli. I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was way too bitter. Then they asked how our food was and I said it tasted burnt. The waitress had the audacity to tell me \"that's how it's supposed to be, but I can tell the kitchen to make you another\". Yeah right, and wait another half an hour? Maybe it took too long bc they forgot and burned my noodles. What happened to customer service where if a customer feels like she tastes charred food, they just apologize for it? Hey, I know carcinogens when I taste it and that was definitely not the brown sauce I expected.   They ended up taking the pad see ew off my bill, which was the least they could do. I think I ate maybe 1/5 of my meal. The crispy tofu was very good, and so was the pad thai. The pad see ew was not good, so either I shouldn't order it next time, or if I want something charred, that's what I should get. Customer service was SLOW as molasses. There were only 3 other tables there besides us, so I don't see how it took so long to get our food. If you're down for 50% satisfaction, this seems like the place to go. I might try to give them the benefit of the doubt and come back but order something else and getting it to go (call in ahead first!). Otherwise, I'd try to look for some other thai place elsewhere, even though this is down the street from where I live."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time last night as we love Thai food. The spring rolls were average, Thai iced tea was delicious. The Pad Thai was good, but the red curry was terrible. There was no coconut milk so it was a broth soup with a few veggies and small slimy shrimp. The service was good and everyone was very nice, but we were quite underwhelmed by the food, and our tummy aches afterward. Sadly we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has very good food.  My wife and I eat here a few times a month and it never gets old.  Heathy food that tastes great!  Spicy cashew with beef is my favorite dish here."}
{"text":"Decent Lunch Specials, Great Service.   Ok, the best way to rate this place is 5 stars for nice and friendly service.... 3 stars for flavor and 4 stars for price to serving value.   I had the pad this and it was decent... I eat a lot of Thai food and it was ok, but not awesome. They give you little bowl of soup and a tiny egg roll  while you wait for your food which is cool, but the soup tastes good and smells like visiting a farm. so I'm not sure how to rate that... When I say visiting a farm I mean the smell of hay, not poo or anything bad... it was confusing...   Parking here is a nightmare. The lot is all marked out parking for other businesses and threatens towing so good luck with that...   I feel bad 3 star rating them since the lady was nice, but it wasn't great...."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to Thai places. With the new owners the food flavoring and spice level is consistent. I love their curries (Arizona heat wave and yellow curry) and I ask for extra broccoli so I can have more veggies. Usually 1 serving is enough to more than full you up.   I also love their fresh spring rolls. Be sure to ask for their satay peanut sauce instead of the sweet and sour peanut sauce to top them. Their soups are good, but the chicken sometimes tastes microwaved. And even when you call in an order, they don't start it until you arrive - which kind of wastes your time. But overall, they are fast, friendly, and tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for lunch. The service is fast and friendly. I ordered the Osha fried rice. The serving was large enough for leftovers. The food was very fresh and flavorful. Since I am not a fan of spicy foods, they accommodated me and toned it down. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a little disappointing. Crab puffs  were terrific however main courses just so so , pad Thai ok , noodles were fresh but just didnt hit it."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I cannot believe Yelpers have given Osha Thai a four star rating. The food is bland, overpriced, and far from authentic. The fried tofu appetizer is a joke. They're not even using fresh tofu they're using prepackaged crap. The chicken curry has no flavor or spice. It is basically watered down yellow broth.  I would not recommend this place even if it was the last place on earth to eat. I would rather eat at McDonald's next door."}
{"text":"Onion cafe maybe?   I ordered take out for my family. I had ordered a vegetable + shrimp dish with a request for no peppers (I'll have heart burn for days if I consume peppers). Anyway, the shrimp was perfect and well seasoned. But, the stir fry that was supposedly a mix of vegetables was about 80% of onions.   My family members also ordered a snap pea dish, and it advertised snap peas, carrots, and onions.  There was also chicken. The dish was about 80% onions also.   The rice was the usual deliciousness.   I just was not that impressed."}
{"text":"Was hankering for some Pad Thai.  Found this restaurant on Yelp.  Ordered the Veggie Rolls.  They were oozing oil and the sauce was bland.  Ordered the Pad Thai and was asked how spicy did I want it which I appreciated.  No lime, maybe 15 pieces of chicken, very little bean sprouts and peanuts and I do believe I had absolutely no egg.  I paid $17 for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"The best thai food ever in scottsdale. Try pad thai , tom yum soup and all dressers great local spot for awesome pad thai.  They also make an amazing pumpkin curry, though it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Osha Thai Cafe in Scottsdale has excellent vegetarian dishes and they prepare take-out meals within 10-15 minutes. The staff is also very nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, and reasonable prices. The place is small and inconspicuous, but don't let that fool you. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. Kind of pricey but it's 100% worth is because it tastes like California Thai food. Pad see ew beef and drunken noodles all the way!"}
{"text":"Went to Osha tonight after reading all the good reviews.  It wasn't good...If you don't care about service or atmosphere, this is great for you.  Waitress was rude and cold, food took forever, refills on our sodas were not offered.  Food was good and prices were ok, but not worth going back."}
{"text":"The panang pork and sweet and sour chicken were excellent. Spiced perfectly, served with a very nice presentation. The service was very good and prices reasonable. We highly recommend this place and will return again. They do a large takeout business."}
{"text":"** POTENTIAL PATRONS BEWARE !!!** Went to Osha Thai Café for dinner, with the family last night.  When the waitress presented me with a handwritten bill: I noticed the restaurant was charging me 9% tax, instead of 7.95% tax which is the correct amount for the City of Scottsdale. I proceeded to show the restaurant owner evidence (City of Scottsdale's website) of the correct (7.95%) tax rate , but he adamantly refused to correct it on my bill.  In addition, they decided to automatically add 18% \"tip\" to the Grand total of the bill. In 2014, the IRS added strict rules when it comes to \"auto-gratuities\". Most restaurants have removed auto-gratuities because the IRS classifies them as a \"service charge\" (not a tip) and taxed as wages.  With that said, there are still some restaurants that are imposing a \"service charge\" for large parties.  As indicated in their menu: Party of 5 or more will have an automatic 18% gratuity imposed, but this should be imposed before tax (etiquette).  Now for the food: I thought $12 for Chicken Panang was fair, until the food arrived.  We were presented with a bowl filled with subpar liquid curry, barely any vegetables, and very little pieces of overcooked (thinned out)chicken (about 1oz. of chicken).  5 chicken curries + 5 Ice Teas + incremental fabricated tax rates = A ~$97 dinner, I'm not going to experience at Osha Thai, again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today after touring the Taliesen West (it's just a few minutes away).  Glad we did!  I started with the Thai iced tea which had good flavor.  Next everyone got soup and a small spring roll with their lunch special.  The small spring roll was nice, and I liked the soup (tofu and cabbage), but one person thought it had too strong flavor.  Everyone really liked their entree.  I had the green curry squid (medium spicy) which had just the right amount of heat, and the squid was very tender.  Overall we walked away happy.  I think if they expanded their menu a little more they could hit 5 stars."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food place in town! This restaurant has been here for over 10 years. They do offer vegan & vegetarian options. The restaurant's atmosphere is very pretty and clean. Their food are really tasty with great representation. Their desserts are delicious. Last but not least an excellent service! Will definitely come back with more friends!"}
{"text":"We first had Osha when a co-worker ordered lunch for the office. I had a tofu soup and a Thai iced tea and husband ordered a curry. Everything was really good, so we decided to go there for lunch. The place is kind of hard to miss if you are driving by and the inside is really plain, but the service is fast and the food is great. I ordered the Pad Thai (mild with tofu) and a Thai Iced Coffee. The husband ordered their Cashew Chicken (medium). Both were delicious! My tofu was tender and the spice level was just right. (Glad I didn't order medium, husband's food was spicy!) The ice coffee was delicious as well. One of the better ones I've had in the valley. Overall, we love coming here and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, intimate setting, understaffed at times, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Thai hot is an awesome level of spicy if you can handle it. Glad Osha likes to make it Thai hot and not American hot. Curries and spicy cashew with shrimp are some of my families favorites. Then again, all the other entrees we have tried are delicious as well. Both take out and dine in is a pleasurable experience. We love having a great Thai restaurant in this part of Scottsdale-we feel fortunate. Eat at this Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I eat Thai all over Las Vegas, and this beats my favorite restaurant there. Owner does all the cooking. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"6/12/14  Mom and I were craving Thai for dinner, so I used the Yelp app to find a restaurant nearby we hadn't tried yet.  It took us awhile to find the place, since the Directions link on Yelp only took us to the general vicinity.  After circling around for a few minutes, I decided to call Osha and ask the person on the receiving end what landmarks he was close to.  He mentioned being behind Blue Adobe, so I punched that in for directions, and voila!  We found Osha in two minutes.  The strip mall was quite packed with cars, with nothing next to Osha available, and I had to circle around once to find close enough parking.  The outside of the restaurant isn't very welcoming, and Mom feared that the place was empty, and sure enough we opened the door, and only one couple was seated and another man was waiting for his takeout order.  All three were white- hmm... where are the Asians?  Seems like we were the only ones there, as the next three people (a couple who was seated, and one man for takeout) who entered were also white.  What is the best way to know if an Asian restaurant is churning out great tasting, authentic Asian food?  When the majority of its clientele is from that cuisine's country, or neighboring countries.  (My Japanese-Hawaiian coworker told me most Asians prefer to eat their food at home, since they think they cook better than chefs/cooks do at the restaurants, and I have heard many Thai people telling me this themselves.  So perhaps this standard measurement of a great restaurant doesn't apply to Thai venues.)  The decor is very nice indoors, however.  Lots of gold-leaf and wood, and shiny dark brown table tops and complementing soft pleather booths, and I liked the water installation near the front entrance.  Very relaxing.  Nice date place, once you get over the parking and exterior.  Food was delicious!  Mom ordered #58 Fisherman's Net, medium-spiced- a platter of shrimp, scallops, clams, squid, and fish sautéed with carrots, bell pepper, onions, lemongrass, and scallions with kaffir lime leaves, $14.  The first couple of bites were underwhelming for her, but she grew to enjoy the dish very much.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-cafe-scottsdale?select=S35fYLQxhI80L7YbE1rzbQ#S35fYLQxhI80L7YbE1rzbQ  She found the sauce to be much better than that of my dish, #39 Gaeng Paa, a red curry cooked without coconut milk consisting of broccoli, bamboo shoots, and green beans and spiced with kaffir.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-cafe-scottsdale?select=f-H40F28bOzZXgk7tedSlA#f-H40F28bOzZXgk7tedSlA  I was told that its mild spice level will be spicier than that of the seafood entree, since there isn't any coconut milk to mitigate the heat, so I went with the mild, and was I glad I did!  Tasted very good, though, and I still had spoonfuls of the spicy broth in between bites.  Both entrees came with a choice of white or brown rice, so we chose white (for her to eat, as she isn't a fan of brown rice, and to have some to take home), but the rice came in one small bowl, and not two.  Strange, that.  Since I was going to skip the rice, I also ordered #5 Osha Golden Pockets to supplement my meal, and to share with Mom, of course!  Four \"money bags\" filled with potato, chicken, and onion spiced with turmeric curry.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-cafe-scottsdale?select=CbTIgcO8CtRVVhH3KYz06w#CbTIgcO8CtRVVhH3KYz06w  It came with a spicy sweet and sour sauce that Mom said was good, but I wouldn't know, since these pockets tasted great w/o the extra sugar and salt to me!  The menu said the pockets had chicken in it, but I did not detect any, and I was OK with that.  I just wish they were bigger!  Too bad the portions of food here are so small.  Not much leftovers, but we did take home enough for Mom to raid just a few hours later, claiming she was hungry again.  (I was good until breakfast, and I think her having rice with her meal had something to do with her blood glucose dropping and her feeling hungry again, but I will never get her to agree with me on this.)  Last, but not least, I ordered two desserts, all homemade: a scoop of green tea ice cream, $4 and a bowl of Thai custard, $3.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-cafe-scottsdale?select=IiN5IvMTQmgvQm1OkPhzNQ#IiN5IvMTQmgvQm1OkPhzNQ  The custard was good- teasing scents of caramel and egg-custard, but not too sweet, nice mouth-feel, but such a paltry serving!  Not worth paying $3 again next time.  The scoop of green tea ice cream was huge, very tasty, and lovely texture.  Gorgeous, as well, with dark flecks.  Almost worth paying $4 again.  Next time, charge me $6 for two scoops and we'll call it a deal!  3.5 stars for atmosphere, food, and good service.  Not quite 4 stars since the portions are too small for the prices.  May bump it up to 4 stars in the future if food quality and service remain consistent.  We'll be back, but not until we've tried other nearby Thai options first."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 3 years. Always order pad see ewe with beef, level 3 out of 1-4 heat level and it is spicy, but always good. I would recommend a level 2 for most people who aren't used to Thai hot, because 3 is enough to make your body temp rise a bit kinda hot - and I'm the type of person who likes raw horseradish...I can't imagine ordering a level 4. Unpretentious and authentic Thai food. Portions are not American sized, but they have the best Thai I've had in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a Pad Thai dish in AZ that could be comparable to ones that are in Portland, OR. I finally found it here!"}
{"text":"OSHA is def one of the better Thai restaurants in Scottsdale. The Thai iced tea is the best I've had since my friends aunt made it from scratch."}
{"text":"The food was fine, nothing special.  The most bizarre thing was that the water had a spicy after taste...my theory is that the hot pepper residue has gotten into their water glasses."}
{"text":"Good flavor and different taste at this Thai restaurant. Great lunch menu. It is small and parking can be an issue when busy."}
{"text":"We stopped at Osha on a sister's night out to the theater, on our way into Fountain Hills. Very neat and clean. we went on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and the food was fantastic. I had the Pad Thai and we got some really great appetizer which I can't remember the name to, but was super yummy. Our drinks were refreshed and our waitress attentive.  Rest room was clean, no changing tables for kids in case your wondering."}
{"text":"Excellent food & excellent service. My husband spent quite a bit of time in Thailand during the Vietnam War, and he thinks this place is very authentic, down to the hot sauces. He had the sticky rice with mango for dessert. I had the coconut ice cream. Our friend had the fried bananas. All desserts were delicious. We will eat here frequently in the future."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been getting take out from Osha for over 6 years. Only recently have I been dining in for lunch on occasion.  The food is always good. Not WOW! great, but consistently good Thai food. I agree with some other reviewers that the portions are not the usual American restaurant size. My 115 lb self  can usually eat my entire lunch entree and feel full but not over-stuffed. They are not generous on the protein either (meat/tofu). Really though, if we're honest, this is a good thing and how we 'should' be eating to be healthy, so I'm not knocking them for this. Dining in, the place is very clean, the service good. Again not a WOW! experience, but I've nothing to complain about either. The lunch entrees are a good deal. I think the lunch appetizers are a bit steep. Overall, yummy Thai food and I'm glad to have them nearby."}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall.  I get the Pad Thai there.  They have different levels of heat that you can order.  I order mild and it is just right.  If you get the hot, it is REALLY hot.  I have eaten in here and had it to go.  It is consistently good both ways."}
{"text":"Ever since we moved to FLW and Shea we have enjoy Osha Thai almost every weekend!  We love their Basil Fried Rice and I always get the phad thai medium so it has a little more spice.  So yum!"}
{"text":"Osha Thai Cafe is one of those 'blink and you'll miss it' places.  It's located in a strip mall on Frank Lloyd Wright and Shea and it's not highly visible from the road.  The strip mall is a relatively quiet place that just doesn't see much action- except for Tango Grill and its abnormally loud karaoke singers!  But if you do go inside Osha, you'll notice that it is a tiny restaurant that has a family owned feel to it.  There are a few tables and booths, and it's generally pretty empty in there.  That's a shame, because the food is really good.  I haven't had Thai food that often though, so I can't be considered an expert on how authentic it is or anything, but I know good food when I taste it.  I got a spicy vegetable soup and pan fried noodles for my meal.  My friend got golden pockets and some spicy chicken dish for his.  We both really loved the food, and our server was very sweet and helpful.  She explained the menu items to us and was always quick with drink refills or anything else we needed.  Give this place a try! I'm sure they could use the business and you'll get a great meal too!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here for lunch.  The place is very small and had only one waitress  We had to wait a while to be seated even though there was a space for us.  Although there was only one waitress who was also responsible for busing the tables (and seating people as they came in), we still got great friendly service.  I had never been to a Thai restaurant before (I always thought the food would be too spicy for me) and was hesitant.  Not only was the food good, but I asked for certain items to be left off and was surprised when I got what I asked for which rarely happens in other restaurants.  I agree with some of the other reviews that there was very little meat in the dish I ordered.  All in all I would definately go back.  I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"I often eat from here because it's pretty close to where I live. My only issue with the place is the inconsistency in the flavor. I ordered the arizona heat wave (red curry)  on 3 different occasions and it tasted different on all 3. I would like not having to guess what my food's going to taste like."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a whim while visiting Scottsdale. Food was hot, prompt and delicious. The restaurant was very clean and inviting and the staff was accommodating as well. All the dishes were very fresh and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great !!  Fast service!! Sweet server !! The owner and his server are extremely kind and humble.  Wonderful Thai food !!!"}
{"text":"June 12 2016 - great Tom Yum soup! Worst pad thai! I will come back for pad see ew. Never ever for pad thai - watery bland - go to Thai House for everything - just too far from my house.   Here is my review early this year .... I ordered beef pad see ew. I am quite surprised that it is very good. I like to try pad see ew at different thai restaurants and I am particular with the noodles. The noodles here is very good not mushy at all. I will recommend based on the pad see we I have tried."}
{"text":"Out of the way spot, that is not very exciting from a decor prospective.  However the food is great.  They are consistent with their spice, flavors, etc. and I've been going there for several years and will continue."}
{"text":"The Mild Basil Fried Rice with Fried Tofu was to die for!!! I'm a bit of a picky vegetarian eater, but I've been looking for good Thai restaurants for sixteen years and this is by far my favorite. Everything was delicious, the place was very clean, and the service was fast and friendly. Staff were very polite, and the atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch Dec 27 th. Sign on door said closed until the 26 th. Guess they can't read the calendar properly. Obviously not interested in being in business. Won't go back there!"}
{"text":"Love the food, waitstaff, laid-back vibe, great place overall!  Pad Thai was delicious, basil and curry dishes flavorful, great service, calming atmosphere.    Have been here numerous times and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of the best Thai restaurants in the valley. One of my clients is close to here so I stop in after my meetings. I haven't had a bad meal yet. Actually everything has been great and tasty. The lunch menu is a really good deal. If you dine-in, your meal comes with a small side salad. It's iceberg but the peanut dressing is yummy. Rice comes with stir fry dishes.  It's a small place but I've never had to wait for a table before. When they're properly staffed, they seem to be able to turn over the tables quickly. Usually my dish comes out pretty fast.  My favorite is the pad kee mow which is the fried wide rice noodles.  Four stars because the first time I was here, they were short staffed and it took a really long time to get my food during a one hour lunch break. I think I'll get over that soon. Plus, I haven't tried them for dinner yet.  Overall, the service is generally good and attentive. The people who work here are really nice. The food is fantastic. I always look forward to have meetings close by during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place.   My personal favorite is the Thai Iced Tea, with Coconut Milk instead of dairy.    I've had it enough times that the manager (so sorry I've forgotten your name!) remembers every time I come in.  =)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now. I had the Chicken Pad Thai both times and it was excellent.  I'm a heat freak: I like my food super spicy.  The first time I ate here I opted for the hottest spice option on the menu, \"Thai Hot\" ... The flavor was great but there still wasn't much burn.  Last night the waitress heard me recounting this to my friend as we were contemplating our orders and asked if we'd like our food \"beyond Thai Hot\".  Heck yeah!  It was pretty much the perfect level of spiciness -- got a little sweat going, but wasn't hot to the point that finishing my meal was a challenge.  The waitress was super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went to Osha for lunch with a couple co-workers and the service was extremely quick, especially with just 1 person working the sitting area from what i saw. Ordered the Yellow Curry, extra spicy, and it came out perfectly.   It's hard to find a good Thai spot, but this one you cannot miss! Writing this review is making me want some curry. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Where to start......OK Osha is my go to place for Thai food in Phoenix. Why you ask....first off all appetizers are made in house...that's right no frozen apps that are deep fried and taste like ever other Asian restaurant. I'm not a Crab Rangoon type of guy (yes I know that's not really Thai)...but when they are made in house and taste like these..yummy.   Chicken Larb is fantastic, great combination of spices and freshness.  Oh by the way Thai Hot level of spice lives up to its name, in case you were wondering.  No overpriced alcohol...cause...wait for it....... it's BYOB!!!  Love their green curry...so creamy....pad kee mow (drunken noodle for the layman) with egg is a favorite and even makes for a good appetizer. Now for the best dish in the house - The Fisherman's Net. Fourteen dollars gets you a huge portion of insanely fresh and very light (I suspect they steam all the seafood first) scallops, mussels, (not rubbery) calamari, shrimp, and lightly fried white fish.  The sauce compliments the seafood like no other...with the lemongrass coming to the forefront of your palate. The place is clearly family owned, and they treat you like a guest in their home.  They are able to capture those authentic Thai flavors, unlike most \"Thai\" restaurants in the valley that just cover your food in dry red pepper flakes (like a slice of pizza) and claim to be authentic.  You will never see red pepper flakes here, instead all fresh Thai chilies.  Their consistency is spot on, so you know what you are going to get every time you visit. For point of reference, I have easily eaten here over 30 times in the past 10 months or so. They are open 7 days a week.  My only complaint (and its barely a complaint) is that they don't serve duck."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. My favorite spot to go for lunch during the week. I ordered the sweet and sour and it was so good. The lunch menu is perfect and for a great price."}
{"text":"A good friend took me to Osha Thai for my birthday.  The beef panang curry is amazing.  I have been known to create errands in this area just to justify a meal at Osha.  Simply yummy food, and I'm coming from north Glendale.  It's not much on decor, but who cares when the food is this good?"}
{"text":"my family and I have been going to this place for a long time. off and one about 2 years. probably some of the best hidden Thai food in the valley. I wish they could deliver. deff. must -- Pad Thai, fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce are my 2 favs."}
{"text":"Osha is a great thai restaurant.  The food is excellent and will make you want to come back time after time.   The atmosphere is ok, but they definetely know how to make great thai food.  Plus the employees are very nice and the prices are good too.  I highly recommend Osha."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant EVER!!!  It's family owned, and the staff are sooo nice!  The portions and prices are great!  They never have trouble making curries just the way we like them! Their yellow curry is so delicious that it brings a smile to my face just thinking about it, and their Osha Golden Pockets are like little yummy pockets of happiness that have yet to be replicated by any other Thai restaurant I've ever been too.  The Pad-thai has the perfect balance of sweet and savory,and the Chicken Satay is so juicy!  They also make a great cup of Thai iced tea :) I wish I still lived in the area!"}
