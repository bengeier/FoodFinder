{"text":"The people were nice but the food was terrible. Fries limp, my bacon mushroom burger came with no bacon and canned mushrooms. My friend ordered the roasted chicken, it was canned chicken! He had to smoother it in canned gravy and cranberry sauce to make it edible. Two others had nachos that were not good and my husbands sloppy joe had corn in it and it said it came with cheese but there wasn't any on it. I think the only items with no major complaints were the wings and tuna melt. If you are just going for the beer then this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Cozy and fun little local bar!  Drinks and food are very inexpensive.  The staff are also friendly and very welcoming.  Tip:  Lorenzo makes a mean martini!!"}
{"text":"I went to The Plates last night for their crazy bingo.  It was really fun.  Lots of friendly people.  Lots of laughter.  The bingo was free.  I ordered a spinach and artichoke dip, it was delicious.  The bartenders were friendly and handled a busy bar well.  The owners are very welcoming.  Always saying hello to their guests and making an effort to let us know they appreciate our patronage.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food great bar Michelle is doing great things scared of her a force to be reckoned with will be back"}
{"text":"fish was awesome!  staff very friendly!  and won a little cash!  what else could you ask for!  we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here especially on karaoke nights. An over all super-fun place to hang out. The owners are terrific people and loads of fun and let me tell you Kathy and Bob who run the karaoke are the best!! Totally recommend checking it out..you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Love this bar!  Food is awesome!!  Staff and patrons make you feel like family!!"}
{"text":"The stars only reflect tonight's experience........I love this place, . The atmosphere and service is great. Its a great place to relax and have a few drinks after work...but they need to find a new band for Friday nights. The band they've has been tolerable until tonight. I'm open to many different types of music but I don't go to a bar to listen to opera. It has its place in the music world, but a bar on Friday nights is not it. I like to go here to relax, not fall asleep. I will return on Friday nights, but if they start singing opera, I'm headed home."}
{"text":"Just out their daily dinner specials they're always delicious with lots of food and include a salad which is a bonus. The cocktails are very inexpensive. I like going on the nights they have curio key. The bartender is always very kind to. You can often see the owner of the restaurant or the bar sitting at the bar watching to make sure everyone is happy."}
{"text":"Fun, friendly \"Old Vegas\" local bar. Owners are fun, food is good and bartenders are amazing."}
{"text":"Corned beef was tough and not enough dressing on salad. Otherwise a nice place. Probably will try the fish fry on Friday night"}
{"text":"What this bar just did for their local schools was amazing!  On top of it all the food and drinks were goooood! Being from Wisconsin I was even more impressed to see Friday Fish Fry on the menu! Will definitely come back here again. Go!! This isn't just another sports bar in Vegas! They are a neighborhood bar that really cares about its Local community!"}
{"text":"Update: 11/10/17 Alright so i finally figured out how it works. All apps are half priced after midnight, this actually is great news, unfortunately for me i get off the bus at 11 PM so i miss it but that much hopefully they'll make an exception since I'm a local and come often, otherwise it's an amazing deal! dont know how i got charged $15 in the past when the regular price is 12.00 and half off is $7.00. Great food, good drinks, and relaxing environment. Check out The Plate for yourself :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Your treated like family and food is amazing! All the bar keeps are awesome and the owners are amazing. Good times all the time."}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this bar? #1 NO dart board and only one pool table.  #2 NO draft beer. The bartender was totally absent from his duties and he walked by me twice when I had an empty beer in front of me. As I cashed out from my michene and waited the bartender was sitting at a machine himself at the far end of the bar oblivious to anything but the game he was playing and I had to call out to get his attention. I overheard one Patron saying to another that the food there was good but I didn't order anything to eat so I cannot comment on the menu. As far as I'm concerned,no dartboard, no draft beer and inattentive service is a no-go for me."}
{"text":"The place is very nice very clean the atmosphere is amazing friendly people great food a must try."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  I small local neighborhood bar that made people from out of state very welcomed.  We ran across this joint on recommendation from a friend.  We ended up there 5-6 times.  Food is great.  We had breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Awesome burgers even at wee hours of the morning. Many includes apps, salads, burgers, lasagne, roast chicken dinner and much more.  Many menu items.    The staff i remember the names of Rachel, Laurie, Josh, Kelly, Johnny, Oh and Bonnie Beverage we all great fun.  I will make this a destination during my next trip to Vegas.   Oh they have Karaoke on Saturdays.  There was a great band that got a lot of people dancing one night.  They are staring a car cruise in on Saturdays that i am disappointed I could not stay  in town for.  Will be there for that and the Friday Fish Fry next trip"}
{"text":"This place is a typical dive.  Dumpy atmosphere, seeking nightclub status by bringing in second rate impersonators.  Cook needs to attend culinary school.  If I had a bucket list desire to visit the worst of the worst Vegas dives, The Plate Bar and Grill would be the place."}
{"text":"Great local bar and restaurant! Awesome homemade EVERYTHING! The owners, staff and patrons all support educators and donate regularly to our neighborhood schools (and take care of their teachers/staff!). Cheap drinks, great entertainment from free bingo night to music and karaoke, awesome bartenders, and fun/caring people all throughout!!! Come visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food and wonderful staff! Coming from Wisconsin we feel very comfortable enjoying ourselves here!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I love coming here after a long day of work to have a couple drinks, a bite to eat and unwind with a board or card game.  The owners, and staff are awesome and all around good company. This is truly a home away from home, but without the drama. I would definitely recommend coming in and checking this bar out, if you having already!  Plus, they are always doing bingo nights, raffle drawings, karaoke, and other fun stuff. Definitely a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Only when truly deserved do I take the time to lambast a really sorry establishment. The Plate fully qualifies for failing to meet even minimal standards. When a $15.99 prime rib dinner is being ordered, the obvious first inquiry from order taker would be as to how you would like it: rare, medium, or well done. Shane, the inept bartender, fails to even bother with that rudimentary step. When presented with the order, I noticed that the garlic toast and dessert were missing. Shane informs that they have no garlic toast and that strawberry jello is available, if desired, as they are out of cheesecake! Obviously, any normal kitchen can prepare garlic toast in minutes unless they have no bread - his excuse is so disingenuous as to be ludicrous. If something on the joint's menu white board signage is not going to be included for whatever reason, management (competent management that is) would simply remove the item with the wipe of a finger. Not these darlings. When my bill came to $22.80, I asked how much was the beer I had while waiting. Reply was, $4.50 plus a take out charge. The meat was gifted to a neighbor who has a big dog. I strongly suggest avoiding this dump at all cost."}
