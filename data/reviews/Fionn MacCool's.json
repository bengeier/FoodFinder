{"text":"These guys didn't reinvent the wheel here... it's airport food so don't expect to be blown away. However, I found the portions to be generous and plates arrive fast. I had the samosa spicy potatoes, 1st of all there's no spice in there, the 5 samosas do not resemble the photo in the menu. They were ok but lacked  flavor (2,5/5). Next I had the Club, too much bread and not enough 'stuff' in it (3/5). Forgive my picture quality, I use a stealthy watch... ;)"}
{"text":"Bad food- yes it is possible to serve bad fries! Tasted like they had been made the day before! Chicken sandwich dry, left most of it. Average service."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Understood that the pub is in an airport but 20 min wait for drinks and refills is unacceptable.  I brought it up to the server and he told me I shouldn't lie.  Food was ok."}
{"text":"Worst calamari ever! The portion was way too small, calamari was overlooked. You would eat the food only if you are starving."}
{"text":"Super expensive refrigerator cold club house sandwich and moody server. The fries were stiff too. The lemon wedge on my drink was brown and gross. I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly but that is about the only good thing I can say about this place. Cold food, wobbly table, issues with cc system. If looks could kill the server who was working the section behind us had it down. She dropped off our food and when we mentioned one of the orders was wrong she gave us a rude look and walked away. We did not know that the item was going to be fixed until our server came by and acknowledged the issue.  Just because it's the airport this chain restaurant should still provide the same experiences as their stand alone stores."}
{"text":"2 stars only because the atmosphere was decent.  My Caesar was brutal and my French Onion was par.  My girlfriends $17 Halibut Sandwich was obviously overcooked in old oil and her salad was wilted and straight from a bag from Sobeys or something.  Basically the ingredients just seemed cheap and thrown together without much care about taste.  Will not be returning unless I'm desperate."}
{"text":"I really have no complaints.  I spent an early morning here a few weeks ago and received prompt and friendly service.  My expectations weren't very high seeing as it is an airport resto but I was pleasantly surprised.  Had an omelette, $1 extra for bacon but note this is chopped up and put in the omelette, rather than on the side as I had expected.  I asked for a side of greens instead of the potatoes & everything looked fresh and tasted pretty good too.  Perhaps breakfast service is better than late night.  In any case, I'm already planning to return here in a few weeks when I'm at the airport again."}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that I hold a lower standard of service for airport restaurants, but this falls below even my low standards. I was connecting through Pearson, so I decided to have breakfast at Pearson. I had the \"Canadian\" breakfast, which was mediocre - as expected. However, the service was abysmal even for an airport. After I finished, there wasn't a server in sight. It wasn't busy; there were only a few other patrons besides myself. The servers weren't in sight, but they were easily heard. They were (along with, I believe, the manager) gossiping loudly behind a partition. They were easily overheard by everyone in the restaurant. I wasn't in a hurry, fortunately. After a few minutes of overhearing their gossip (not by choice), I went behind the partition and asked my server for my bill. She brought out my bill and a wireless credit card reader. She then left me alone with the credit card reader! It wasn't hard to do on my own; there were instructions on it. But what if I'd decided not to play nicely? This restaurant is the lowest of the low. Just buy something from a deli. Anything is better than this."}
{"text":"Well over priced, even for the airport. Food was bad, its just that simple. Your held hostage at the airport but walk over to gate B20 and hit the Tim's."}
{"text":"Horrible experience - service was very slow and the waitress did not listen to my order and brought me extras on a burger that I did not ask for. She kept trying to get me to buy bottled water and other things I did not ask for. She also brought my the wrong bill which was more expensive and I had to correct her. On my actual bill she changed me for extras that I did not ask for and refused to change it. I left filling ripped off There are lots of new restaurants in the new terminal 3, including fast food options that I'm sure would provide better service and I would suggest going there instead."}
{"text":"The beer choices are awful, no craft beer here but what causes me to review and rate a one star is the bartender that served me on a recent afternoon on my layover. He was a bigot and making no secret of it. Speaking very loudly to anyone who would listen, about one of the managers. He found himself to be oh so clever as he altered her name to somehow reflect on her nationality. Every server that came to the bar was assailed with his bigoted views.  He didn't smile, wasn't pleasant in the least.  What you think of a tired, washed up airport bartender.  Oh, and crappy beer too!"}
{"text":"For all those bad reviews here is what I feel is a realistic expectation. 1) You are in a pub...they serve pub food! 2) The location is a busy terminal where no regulars exist and no relationships are formed! 3) The drinks are cold and the menu is above average!  When I went in the restaurant exterior attracted myself and several other hungry and thirsty travellers because it is attractive and looks to offer comfort food and much needed beverages. That is exactly what I got...the staff was overworked and the quarters are tight so it felt like an authentic Irish pub in every sense.   The food was pub like and gave calories on the menu which I loved. The waiter was polite, efficient and didn't miss a beat with our orders even without a pen or tablet...experience spoke volumes to me with that.   I see so many bad reviews it makes me a little sad. Why expect fine dining and high end staff when you are stopping in, no doubt in a hurry, for a quick bite and a drink and walk out mad because that is what you got!"}
{"text":"I think you have to hit the happy hour menu and prices to find much value here. I just missed the happy hour but decided to eat here anyway since I walked over from another nearby hotel. The place was nearly empty on a Thursday night. The server was great, that was about it. The food was mediocre and that's generous. I certainly wouldn't bother going here nor visit again myself."}
{"text":"Food came out fast. The service was horrible. The food was ok and way over priced. What else can you expect from airport food I guess."}
{"text":"Standard pub. Had the Irish nachos and the chicken boxty. Pretty good. Jas was a great server."}
{"text":"OMG horrible! I don't like to post a review of anything unless I have something good to say but I am compelled here. Stopped here to get a nice meal on our way home from vacation. The waiter took our drink order and brought them promptly, then took our food order. In the 40 minutes that followed a gentleman sat down at the next table, ordered, received his food, ordered a second beer and got that, and we still saw no sign of our food. When we finally got our food my wife's shepherds pie just tasted like pepper, my burger was dry and tasteless and I never did get the fries that were supposed to come with it. It's one thing to get bad service. It's one thing to get bad food. Getting both is in acceptable. I will be making an effort to spread the word about this one. Shoulda gone to Smashburger. My wife said a bowl of soup from Tim Hortons would have been better."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a coworker before our flight back to Vancouver.  There was a huge lineup to get a table so we decided to go the bar.  The beer selection on tap was very limited (would have been nice if they carried even a small selection of local or craft beer).  The service was absolutely horrendous.  The bartender was completely miserable and was literally throwing dishes and cups around loudly.  She didn't acknowledge our presence at all until another customer who was also waiting for service flagged her down (we were too scared to even try to flag her).  We then got our beers slammed down in front of us as our order was apparently making her day untolerable.  My colleagues food was decent but the service in this place was horrendous.  I understand being understaffed and servers being busy but perhaps they should train their staff to leave their rage at home.  I prefer my Bud Light without the complimentary side of \"sass\" and anger."}
{"text":"Bad food, poor beer selection and the worst, terrible service. It not only takes a long time, but staff is very rude. Definitely not what I would expect of an airport restaurant, I won't go back there!"}
{"text":"An OK place for a quick before plane meal. it's nice the menu lists the calories. I also like that the PA is piped through so you can hear flight details.  I don't like the fries here they always taste or cooked or dried out to me.  I tried the steak and it was good. hard to cut with a plastic knife though.  All in all a good place. very friendly servers and a decent atmosphere. I prefer the bar to a table."}
{"text":"Any port in a storm. If you are changing planes and not exiting the boarding area, there's not a lot of choice, i.e. Tim's. The breakfasts are OK. Their coffee cups don't retain heat very well. But I liked my pub breakfast. By the way, French fries are not home fries!"}
{"text":"Had the steak and fries. The steak had no flavour and the fries tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while."}
{"text":"A hungry Calgarian entered the airport on the Saturday red-eye. With a 3 hr layover ahead of her before a flight out to Mexico, this particular Calgarian needed some breakfast. Fast food doesn't normally sit well with her when she hasn't slept well, so a proper sit down meal was required.  The only place that had a decent looking menu was Fionn MacCool's. With only two servers on, service started out slow. And it remained slow. The two of them seemed to be a bit overwhelmed and rushed to keep up. Our server kept double checking on things she had asked us already, \"You wanted brown, right?\" as she went walking by a few moments after we had already told her our order.   Our food was... meh. We both ordered the Canadian Breakfast. Luke warm by the time it made it to us, peameal bacon that sounded good when it was described and ended up not really being something to write home about, sunnyside up eggs that were have cooked and half runny and soggy toast. At least the coffee was hot. But no refills showed up during the hour we were there (not that we asked outright, but usually someone comes around with the pot?).  Anyway, good points. Despite her forgetfulness and the ungodly hour of the morning, our server was  friendly and polite.  If you're looking for breakfast at the airport, I'd pass on Fionn MacCool's."}
{"text":"I always eat here when I'm passing through Pearson. The food is good, portions are fair and the service is usually pretty efficient. Prices are comparable to other airport restaurants.  I was disappointed to hear today that they've discontinued the Market Sandwich but otherwise I can't complain!"}
{"text":"came in for drinks before our flight from Toronto to Calgary 3 servers were discussing how table \"103\" us was not their table, my fiancé finally went up to someone and asked for service, then all the sudden a 4th server came and served us ordered a bloody mary, diet coke and guniness poutine fries my fiancé said the poutine wasn't good at all and hardly ate it, took a while to get a refill for his diet coke too bloody mary was ok nothing special but I guess you can't expect that much from an airport restaurant"}
{"text":"The seats are cramped, the food was bland and the beer selection was mediocre at best. I know you need to temper your enthusiasm at airport pubs, but oof.  They get a star for the friendly, hard-working, quality servers."}
{"text":"When the two kids both say that this was the best airport meal ever, you know you've made a good choice.   Nothing fancy for us.... a burger for me and a Reuben for each of them. All came with great fries and a couple of yummy pickle spears. My burger was cooked exactly to order and topped with delicious fried onions and fresh lettuce and tomatoes. Their Reubens were huge. They were kind of unusual with provolone cheese (instead of Swiss), bacon in the sour kraut, banana peppers, and mustard.    The service could have been a bit better..... our waitress never checked on us and our water glasses sat sadly empty for quite a while. But, we ate every morsel of our meals."}
