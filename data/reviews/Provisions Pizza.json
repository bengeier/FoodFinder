{"text":"I had an hour and 15 minutes for lunch today.  Jury Duty.  Walked a couple blocks north and east and came across this place.  Sign outside said something about now open for lunch.  I like pizza and the place wasn't crowded yet so in I went.  Maybe that should have been a warning though.  Two people in line in front of me.  2 and a half people working the kitchen and register.  Nearly 10 minutes to get ordered and rung up at the register.  Picked an open table, there were a lot of them, sat down with my number 8 and waited.    Now I am not trying to be a snob, their claim is you can't rush good food.  And they have a mini conveyor oven. Double level though.  Like a mini Dominos.  Who does that today?  And the dough was initially shaped by a tool. Not the guy operating the press.  A dough press machine thing. Placed on a screen. Anyway it says 7 minute cook time.  So why was it more like 20?  Now I am stressing a little bit.  Haven't even received my pie yet and I'm thinking about how long it will take me to get back to the court house.   Rating is dropping the longer I have to wait. I'm thinking maybe they just shouldn't try to open for lunch.   Somehow I got my pie before the two guys in front of me.  And they ordered the same thing.   It's burnt in one edge and somehow not cooked all the way elsewhere. Can't really hold up a slice, it just, well collapses on itself.  I scarf down two slices because I am hungry. I need to get going though.  I need to find a homeless person on the way back to give this to.  And hope they don't chase me down trying to give it back!"}
{"text":"Very convenient lunch spot. The food is quick and simply to order, and the food comes out in to go containers. Staff is exceptionally friendly. Place is also very clean. I would return strictly for quick Italian food!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing that downtown needs, it's good pizza.  Unfortunately this place will not be bringing that. I had a cheese pizza. It took forever (not good for a downtown lunch, and they weren't even busy). The pizza was large but the crust was like rubber. You literally could not pick up a slice, not even close. The pizza had no flavor. Not good at all."}
{"text":"I had the fettuccini alfredo with chicken. At first I didn't think it was a lot of food for $10 but it being pasta ended up being the right amount. I was a little surprised though that at least a small slice of bread wasn't included with the meal, I mean I had this wasted sauce! :)  Hoping they will pick up the pace once they are open a while, food took some time to get and they seemed disorganized. I will be back to try the pizza."}
