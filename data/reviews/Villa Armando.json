{"text":"The setting for this Italian restaurant is the oldest house in this part of Montreal, 250 years old. It was renovated four years ago into a restaurant. A husband and wife team from Rome operate the place. They have a small porch which is ideal for dinner on a warm evening. The interior rooms are small, intimate and with all the charm you would expect.  We ate in their private dining room upstairs, which was formerly the master bedroom.  Since we did not order off the menu, I cannot comment on the selection available. The food we were served was traditional Roman. Service was professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!!  Set up in a beautiful house in TMR,  the staff are super friendly and the food is great.  They also offer gelato in the summer,  you should definitely try.  What's amazing about the place is that the chef goes out of his way to pick the best ingredients for every meal.  You will always find what's in season and all at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very tasty. Classical setting in a old house. Formal, but warm. Might be a bit overcooked for the veal chop"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance for a formal setting. I really loved the decoration in each room and the friendly staff.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a quiet dinner among friends or a quiet date night.  They have a great selection of wine and delicious pasta dishes. Though my favourite dish was the gnocchi :) ...I left full and wanting to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow. The set up in the restaurant is so charming. Loved the paintings on the walls and the overall atmosphere. The service was fantastic, and the prices were fair.  I ordered the aragula and goat cheese salad (on the special menu for that day) and it was phenomenal.   My seafood linguine was perfectly executed, although it wasn't necessarily special or extraordinary in any way.   I did however try some of the filet mignon that someone else ordered, and that was AMAZING. Easily the best filet mignon I've ever had. I wish I had ordered that instead."}
{"text":"You will need a reservation. That said we didn't have one but we were lucky enough that a group had pushed their reservation for 1h30 later. Service was courteous and quick, filling our water glass before it was empty yet we never felt them hovering.  The place is very warm and charming and ideal for date night they did an amazing job transforming this 250 yo home into a beautiful restaurant. The food was very good I had the clam linguini with the white wine sauce which was delicalty flavour and the garlic was just perfect with a nice presence that wasnt overpowering. My partner had the mushroom risoto which she enjoyed very much with a glass of wine.  Special touch: they brought us 2 piece of brushetta while we were ordering and even if we didn't stay for desert and coffee, they brought us 2 biscotti.  Bill was around 70$ but was well worth it for the quality of the food. We will definatly be back and we'll check out the garage turned gelato shop next summer"}
{"text":"I personnaly went in the kitchen to thank and see the chef of my filet Mignon. I have never experienced such a thing before. He made me get up from my seat to see him and just praise him on how delicious his sauce on the filet was. I would hire him to cater for my wedding if I could!! This is an amazing chef from Italy . This restaurant is a hidden treasure! I will always come back to see Armando!! Wow! Just Wow!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in an old stone house and I love the ambiance.  The service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get.    The antipasti are quite big so it's definitely worthwhile splitting amongst two people.  The Caprese salad and arugula parmesan salad are good choices.  Both are very simple yet very tasty.  When it comes to the main course the rabbit is an excellent choice.  It's seasoned nicely and very moist.  Their tiramisu is excellent here.  I find a lot of places drizzle the alcohol over the ladyfingers making it overpowering.  If it's worked into the mascarpone mixture then it doesn't drown out the other flavours.  My guess is that they do the latter because there's a nice delicate balance of flavour in the tiramisu.  Overall it's an excellent restaurant and it's definitely worth the trip."}
