----------------------
Went here for lunch yesterday and had a turkey flatbread sandwich with extra avocado and a side of baked sweet potato fries - my friend had the ahi tuna burger with cucumber salad. Both entrees and sides were excellent.

Service was extremely friendly, the place seemed cool, random fitness zines on racks for your reading pleasure, and free WiFi. 

Healthy food that tastes great and isn't boring? This may actually be the place. 

And of course, you can defeat the whole point of eating here by going to Baskin Robbins a couple doors down afterwards for a triple scoop waffle cone, but save that for sometime in February - you know, when you've stopped going to the gym. Again.

Edited to say that I've eaten here a number of times since this review, and they've always been consistent - good food (ie. the ahi tuha burger with asian cucumber salad) and extremely friendly service."}
{"text":"One day when my jeans were fitting a little snug (I think it was a day after Cheesecake Factory) I waddled my fat ass to Soma Express. This place has taken healthy eating and made it delicious - how about that?  Let me caveat it by mentioning it's not for everyone.  But if you're on a diet or are into low-fat, low-calorie and veggie options Soma Express is your place.  

Highlights
* Service and restaurant set-up is counter style ala Pei Wei.  
* The people who work here are REALLY nice - which is something you just don't see much of these days.  
 * Fat grams, carb counts and calories are PRINTED on the menu - (omg I think I'm in LOVE, what a socially responsible restaurant?)
* Free wifi - (lots of yuppies working on laptops here)

I've had breakfast and lunch here and was pleased.  Omelet dishes are very healthy (think mixture of eggs and egg substitute) - mine was a sirloin steak and non-fat mozzarella cheese with cinnamon raisin toast, all with under 300 calories.  For lunch I've had their extra-lean and 99% lean turkey burgers served with baked French fries.  For those of you familiar with Topz in CA or Better Burger in NY - the taste is very similar, flavorful without the grease.  Soma is about as close as we get to those places for healthy burgers.  The menu had a number of veggie options (salads and burgers with tofu, eggplant, ahi tuna and salmon).

Prices are little more than one would expect ($8 for a burger), but I for one don't mind paying a little extra for healthy quality."}
{"text":"So sad, so very sad...
Even with consistent 4 star reviews on Yelp, Soma Express could not survive on the Camelback Corridor!  

I went by for lunch today as I was craving their mirin soy glazed turkey salad and Soma's yummy baked sweet potato fries.  I can almost smell those fries as I am walking to the door... only to see a sign that says they are CLOSED!

Rumor has it they are building a new Soma Express somewhere in Old Town, but until then, I guess I'll just have to make the trek to the original Soma at Tatum and Shea!"}
{"text":"If I were a vegetarian or super health conscious, this place would absolutely rock.  However, being a normal guy, this place is decent.  I like the occasional salad as much as the next guy, and they've got good ones.  

The chicken isn't the best, but I like their house made flatbread.  I'd  eat here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I wish I had found this place sooner!  It's great...the menu is filled with tons of healthy, vegetarian meal options (they have meat options too) and they give you the nutritional content info of each dish right on the menu! Nice.

They have pizza, salad, sandwiches, burgers etc, and the prices are pretty reasonable considering you're getting really fresh, healthy ingredients in your meal.

They have great smoothies, and I love their omelets.  I definitely recommend trying this place out if you're looking for a tasty, yet healthy meal that won't add more junk to your trunk."}
{"text":"Healthy food. Open for breakfast/lunch/and dinner.  I often stop here for a quick dinner when I am too lazy to cook .  The menu includes salads, sandwiches, flatbread pizzas, rice bowls, etc.  The menu actually lists the nutritional content of each menu item.  You will see a lot of sweaty people in running shorts and tank tops here.  Oh yeah, it's good and pretty cheap.  The turkey burger (served with a side of cucumber salad) is excellent.  Their homemade granola is pretty damn good too.

Note - the menu is hit or miss here.  The vegetarian options are all quite good, as is the salmon.  But the chicken tends to be dry and chewy - not good. I always get the grilled veggie wrap.  It's fantastic."}
