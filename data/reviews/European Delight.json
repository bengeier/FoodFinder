{"text":"This is my favourite store at St.Lawrence market, and THAT is a tough call given all the other delicious stuff there. I was put off yelping about it, because I don't want it to have outrageous lineups for weekday lunches like Mustachios often has.  It's a family run business, the service is always friendly and quick, and they have amazing food for cheap!! Its located on the lower level of the market, near the juice store.   They have an amazing selection of perogies to buy and prepare at home, or if you buy a dozen(which is the smallest unprepared amount they are sold as) for $5 they will prepare them fresh for you! The pre-prepared ones they have are Potato and cheese, and meat. My favourite are the jalapeno cheddar/potato ones. YUM!  The one thing I always *have* get, and as should you if you are a fan of eggplant, or not (this might convert you into a fan) is the roasted stuffed eggplant with tomato and cheese. Subtle flavours that all meld together to make it amazing! $2  They also have cabbage rolls(my first time trying them so cant really compare, but i liked them). My SO is a HUGE fan of the veal schnitzel, the chicken schnitzel is good too. The potato latkes are really good with sour cream, as are the mini potato dumplings.   The only slight drawback is that most of the food is often pre-prepared for the lunch time rush. I cant even imagine how much better it would be fresh.  If I could afford the calories of having lunch from this place every single day, I would.   This is definitely one of Toronto's *best* in my opinion."}
{"text":"There are so many food options at European Delight - a delight for the eyes and my stomach! Often I find my eyes are bigger than my stomach when I come here and I overcompensate by buying stuffed chicken leg, lasagna, or cabbage roll with a side of perogies. I think it goes without saying that this place has the best perogies, hands down.  What I love best is that the food options are very affordable and don't leave you feeling guilty (even with the extra side of perogies)."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious....I've never been disappointed, and on top of that the staff is very friendly and treats their costumers excellently. The food is perfection but I must say I look forward to going to European delight because the staff always leaves me walking away with a smile on my face that lasts a good while.   Anyone who complains about the fact that the food is microwaved and they use Styrofoam plates is just stuffy....there's no way they could make all that food on command in a short amount of time (they are fast food after all). You are missing out if you turn your nose up at Styrofoam and a microwave...just go to a sit down restaurant instead of complaining...."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for good lunch between classes or for take home for dinner when I don't feel like cooking. My faves are the gigantic cabbage rolls which are stuffed full of seasoned meat and rice. They even give you some extra sauce for when you reheat them at home so they don't dry out. The perogies are great too. They are much smaller and less doughy than what you get at church but they have a great cheesy flavour. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here. The lasagna is amazing and so is the whitefish and cheese dish. Of course the perogies and cabbage rolls are great too. Go here, it's the un-discovered gem of the market."}
{"text":"the people who serve you are crabby and frown-y as heck. but the food's good so I guess that's why I still get stuff from them time and again. their potato pancakes are so damn good I can eat 3 at a time - maybe more, but I have yet to try. their cabbage rolls are a 'healthier' option. I've only ever bought their pierogies frozen, which make for a tasty and fairly quick meal."}
{"text":"We went to The Market to stock up for NYE and purchased 2 bags of frozen potato and cheese pierogi as well meat and veg cabbage rolls.   Well what a hit, we just boiled the pierogi and poured fried onions over top with side of sour cream.   Normally I fry the pierogi with the onions but these were so good that they didn't need frying.   The cabbage rolls were also delicious.  They will be in our rotation of meals in the month for sure. Just love the Market and the selection of amazing foods."}
{"text":"Great stall downstairs in St.Lawrence market selling a large selection on Eastern European food . The people on the stall are very patient and don't mind explaining about the different food items on sale. I went for the cheese Knish,Hungarian stuffed cabbage, latkes and Russian potato salad,they heated everything apart from the salad . It was very tasty and filling well worth trying."}
{"text":"As I was walking to find a place to eat, I stumbled onto a woman eating pierogis and tapped her on the shoulder to ask her where she got them because they looked great.  She stared up and me and said... down the hall. They are AMAZING and so cheap, too.  I found out she wasn't kidding. For a little over 4 bucks, you get 12 handmade pierogi that are fantastic. While the veal was yummy, it was the potato and cheese that really knocked it out of the park, and I consider myself to be a pierogi snob.  I could have eaten 30 of them.  Just one warning: they aren't light on the grease. But with pierogis that good, who cares."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me?!  12 small perogies for $4.50.   And to make a bad story worse.  In the flipping microwave!!!!!  Threw out half of them jalape√±o cheese perogies.  Place is a dive too.  Don't believe the perogie hype about this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for some perogies the other day. They were amazing!  I got 6 potato cheddar and 6 veal perogies. It's St. Lawrence Market after all, so it's not fancy by any means. Initially, I was a bit disheartened that they were served up on styrofoam plates and reheated in the microwave.   However, that quickly changed after taking my first bite into the perogie. The shell was the perfect texture, not too soft or hard. Both the veal and the potato cheddar stuffing were surprisingly flavorful.  I'm by no means a perogi expert, but these are definitely some of the best perogies i've ever had. I preferred the veal perogies. Initially I bought these to share, but by the time I found my compatriots, they were already half gone.  It's quite the value at 6 for $2.50 and 12 for $4. Anyone passing by The St. Lawrence Market should check out European Delight. I'll definitely be back to try their other eats."}
{"text":"MmmM... Perogies! I may not be an expert on perogies but I know what I like.  The cooked perogies are reheated in the microwave, but they're still pretty damn good! European Delight is my main go-to place whenever I take a trip to St. Lawrence market. I only get the cheese and potato and sometimes the bacon cheese and potato. I've tried the veal perogies and the cheese crepe, they were meh.   Best deal are the frozen perogies to cook at home... $10 for a bag of 50 pcs. Just boil, add some onions and sour cream.  The space is very basic and narrow. Just grab your perogies and grab a seat nearby. Service is fast and the gentleman at the front is nice and informative.  Don't forget to stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"In context of the variety of options of ethnic eats at SLM, this place is definitely up there. The cabbage rolls, latkes, blintzes, stuffed mushroom caps are consistently good. The service is captured well by the no nonsense petite Eastern European lady of few words. She just wants to know what you want and if it's takeaway or for here which I don't mind. Prices are fairly reasonable and I have grown attached to this place for its solid fare."}
{"text":"The most amazing perogies that I have ever put in my mouth.  This Ukrainian couple serves a variety of perogies and even offers a value of 50 frozen perogies for $10.  Additionally, they serve knish, cabbage rolls, latkes, lasagna and so much more.  Six hot, perfectly prepared perogies with sour cream for $2.50.  They were so good I went back for seconds and then thirds.  This is truly a hidden treasure in Toronto and if you have not been then you are missing out."}
{"text":"I found an Eastern European food stand located in the basement of St. Lawrence Market, close to the public washrooms. It's probably a tourist trap but until I find another this is my go to place for now. They serve a wide selection of comfort dishes at reasonable prices from pierogi, knish, latke, cabbage rolls & blintzes just to name a few.    I sampled their pierogi, potato & cheese, and they were filling for a light breakfast. It's served with a dollop of sour cream if you want but at home I usually put ranch dressing on it. I know I'm weird. They also make veal pierogi or pelmeni as they're known in Russia and dessert pierogi, which I may sample later today maybe. Definitely a place to check out whenever you're visiting the Market."}
{"text":"Very disappointed and I really don't understand the positive reviews below. How could European Delight possibly rate so high. Microwaved food served with plastic and Styrofoam is not what I would call \"wholesome\" or \"home cooking\" and that is just the beginning.  I waited for ever to be served, one person ahead of me and it took over 15 minutes. I wanted a cabbage roll and a piece of chicken for lunch.  I was surprised when they put it on a plastic dish and placed it in the microwave (I don't use a microwave at home for obvious reasons).  I asked them to please put it on a glass plate.  Then they rang up my order and I realized I had no money. I asked if I could pay by visa, they said yes, but because it was under $10 they would have to charge me an additional 35 cents. I pay $120 a year for my visa card, I don't know why I should have to pay another 35 cents, I saw this as my opportunity to leave, so I just said no thanks and left.  I don't like to be difficult, I was more fed up than anything else and then when she wanted to charge me an extra 35 cents, that was adding insult to injury.   Oh, then when she took my chicken out of the microwave, she placed it back on the display for the next person.  That will taste just great wont it! lol Cant imagine calling this wholesome or homemade unless you were raised on microwaved food.  In regards to the 35 cent service charge required for visa, I would suggest they take that up with visa. They lost a $9 sale.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"Love both the veal & potato/cheese perogies. They're very soft & flavorful, especially with the sour cream! Price is really cheap as well, so win/win."}
{"text":"Can't write review. Too full! Being of Ashkenazi Jewish descent I know a thing or two about the hearty peasant foods of Eastern Europe. This place, hidden in the middle of the basement at St Lawrence market, its easy to walk by. If you happen in you will see every hard working golden age ladies Manning the microwaves and dishing out plate after plate of perogoies, cabbage rolls and other dishes of the region.   Its no frills service and the microwave may heat some things unevenly but who cares! 6 perogoies are like 2.75. A cabbage roll is $4. I paid with a $10 @nd got change back. This food  sticks to your ribs and you won't go away hungry."}
{"text":"About as authentic as it gets.  A dozen cheddar perogies, fried in oil & onion as they should be, ring in at $4.25. Nice portion of filling and the dough is properly thin. Appropriately served with a side of sour cream.  We also indulged in a cabbage roll (I believe that is also around $4), which was massive and filled to the brim. I grabbed a piece and the sauce tasted spot on with its flavour (tomato-based). I also ordered a small Russian potato salad, and again, the flavours were there with the familiar friends of peas, carrots, etc. We had a filling lunch for two come in around $17 with a shared pop.  It's a no frills place, with your food heated up in the microwave. We ordered on and on, and the young man working apologized for not timing it properly - not his fault, as we kept adding and adding to our order.   Do yourself a favour and drop into this place. They even have trays of items for takeout so you can indulge at home. Their products are clearly homemade and not imported in from one of the big factories."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly people and delicious food!!  Perogies in multiple flavors, meatballs, and latkes!!    Marina is the queen of the Perogies!!"}
{"text":"The owners are friendly and personable and recommended the spinach and feta frozen pierogi, which I took home to cook for dinner. I topped with bacon, carmelized onions, sour cream, and green onions. They were a hit! Great price as well, at around $11 for 50 frozen pierogi. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Straight up delicious soft squishy pierogies with sour cream. Great value as well - 6 for $2.25, 12 for $4.25. We grabbed 6 initially then came back at the end of our trip and got more. Everything they have looks hearty and delicious. Knish, latkes, schnitzel and other delicious Eastern European goodies."}
{"text":"The cabbage rolls and pierogies are so consistently delicious, and the prices are great.... definitely 5/5. The service is friendly and courteous, and they always add things like sour cream and extra sauce for you. I just have to remember to bring my own containers next time!"}
{"text":"12 Potato and Cheddar Perogies $4.95 Delicious and Budget Conscious  #Recommend  Incredible Comfort Food with the BEST Prices in Town. Vegetarian options for Cabbage Rolls, Lasagna and Perogies. A hidden gem downstairs in St. Lawrence Market. Ben coming here for years and always my 1st choice to grab something to eat before a Film or Show."}
{"text":"The first I passed by this place, the oblong shapped fried food on display could not keep me from wanting to move away. There are also a bunch of other equally delicious looking dishes on display such perogies, chicken dishes, chicken meatballs  and beef meatballs, latkes, blintz and creamy salads. As well, there are other prepared foods to check out here. I love quaintly shaped fried food and some of the items on display at this store reminded of Croquettes so I took home a potato knish and a triangle shaped spinach blintz. I had a comforting Eastern-European dinner that evening.  On my second trip I decided to get four different items, consisting of a spinach and mushroom Blintz, a cheese Blintz, a potato Latke, and a meat Knish. I had the potato Latke that evening and it was good. I had the other three items for brunch the next day and I really liked the spinach blintz and the meat knish.  European Delight is another store at St. Lawrence Market where you can get a quick, convenient meal that gives you a small introduction to some Eastern European comfort foods. Next time I get something from here, I'll be trying their perogies and the meatballs."}
{"text":"I haven't had perogies this good since my Polish ex-boyfriend 's mother used to take over my kitchen for an entire weekend to make them from scratch. (His name was Bartek, big muscles, small brain)  I have been eating at European Delight for the past three Saturdays spent at the St Lawrence Market. (Perogies ARE a breakfast food, damn you!)  They have so many things here and everything I've tried is delicious. The cabbage rolls are $3.75 and are giant. They have both meat and vegetarian varieties. One roll fills a whole plate. You can take it home or they will heat it up, add some tasty tomato sauce and you can eat it right there.  The perogies cost $2.50 for 6 or $4 for a dozen, you can also buy bags of 50 frozen for $10.   European Delight also has potato latkes, apple dumplings, spinach and cheese dumplings, schnitzels and all sorts of fresh made salads you can purchase by weight.   The service is always really friendly. I'm surprised this booth is not as busy as some others in the market, because it's AMAZING."}
{"text":"Looking for a savory snack brought us to this stall out of the many offerings in the building. For $2.90 after tax, you get 6 cheese and potato or veal perogies heated up with a dollop of sour cream on top. I opted for the cheese and potato for the maximum comfort-food factor. The little dough pouches of carbs and cheddar had obviously been previously fried with onions, each shiny with oil and they slipped around the styrofoam container freely. I liked that you can actually taste the cheese in the filling and the smoothly mashed potato is great next to the slightly chewy texture of the dough. Definitely will keep this place in mind and try out their other offerings the next time. Great service also, really patient in explaining what choices there are for you to pick from. Quick, greasy and cheap savory comfort food!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch the other day.  It's located in the lower level of the St Lawrence Market. It took a little time, but we found it.  The pierogies are tiny, but oh my goodness, they are delicious.  Also had a holubchi. Excellent.  I was disappointed that they didn't have kielbasa, but they directed me to another vendor on the same level. That's a different Yelp review........"}
{"text":"- What I have tried:    + Cabbage roll (5/5): This is basically meat wrapped in cabbage and tomato sauce. It was sooooo goooooood, meat and cabbage went so well together and tomato sauce just added extra flavour to the roll and it's only $4 something. The roll was big but didn't feel me up :P     + Potato and cheese perogies (3/5): It's a combination between potato and cheese so it makes sense that it tasted basically like mashed potatoes dumplings, and it was too creamy that I couldn't finish the second one.     + Veal perogies (5/5): Love this one, the meat was not dry but instead it was soft and flavourful, tasted even better then paired with sour cream, which they would give you.  - Portion: generous - Price: so cheap, you could totally try two different foods for under $10. If they opened another store near my house, I would go there everyday ^-^  - Highly highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We had stared with just having the perogies. But then we had to go back to to try the stuffed mushroom and spinach and mushroom blintz. Everything has a lot of great flavours. Not sure if it's made same day because they heat in microwave before serving. But otherwise good."}
{"text":"I can't ever leave the St Lawrence Market without some of these pierogies. Today I was hungry so I ate some pierogies and a smoked salmon blini. Amazing! I also got a dozen for the freezer."}
{"text":"I went there last Wednesday for lunch, excited to try their perogies. I got there and tho the place looks quite cramped and dirty, and the food not very appetizing, we got bunch of stuff to try, and for a considerably cheap price. The cabbage roll was really tasty and (veal) perogy fillings were very flavorful.  It is highly recommended ;D"}
{"text":"Affordable, decent, and tasty food.  -1 star because I asked for veal perogies and they gave me potato and cheddar instead, another -1 star because they microwaved my perogies in a styrofoam container..."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Eastern European cuisine at the market. Decided to go for a lunch that would put me to sleep at my desk for the second half of the day. Veal perogies were spectacular, the potato cheddar - a little boring. A spinach and cheese blintz is so necessary, and a very satisfying cabbage roll. Say yes to sour cream on everything, extra fried onion on the perogies. Don't be surprised if you think it's half price day, super economical."}
{"text":"$2.50 for 6 DELICIOUS pierogies! Can't be beat."}
{"text":"Really wholesome food that's as close to home-made as it gets. Like others have mentioned, the lasagna and cabbage rolls are probably the best things to get. Perogies, potato pancakes, and others things are great too."}
{"text":"6/24/15:  Came here as part of a food tour, and so we tried a ton of stuff here.  With everything we had unfortunately I can't remember too much of this place, but I guess that's the point.  1. Pierogi: So, I don't remember the exact flavor we had, except that it had potato in it.  I do remember it was somewhat bland, and I was happy to try it to say I finally have, but it's not anything exciting to eat.  Maybe if we tried one of the ones with more meat I'd be happier, but as it is I'd say it was the equivalent of eating home-refried/baked frozen fries.  Sorta.  5/10.  Maybe their other stuff is better, but I didn't try so I wouldn't know.  But just based on their pierogi, I don't see anything special here.  3/5  #canada #pierogi #polish #ukrainian"}
{"text":"This place is almost like a secret gem in the St. Lawrence Market. I came by here for lunch one cold January day and it was quiet, but I knew they were good. I ordered a cabbage roll that had beef and rice inside for about $5 - what a steal! It was pretty tasty, but not 4-star quality. The rice and beef was very nicely spiced but the cabbage was a bit tough to eat with the plastic utensils. I think next time I'd try the perogies instead. I'd give them another go. There's lots to pick from in terms of selection.  Tip: they are located downstairs/lower level. If you see the Italian place (meat sandwiches), walk right. If you see a Greek restaurant, you've accidentally walked left.   Tip 2: Cash and VISA accepted.  Tip 3: Everything in their counter can be heated up, just ask."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have more reviews! The pierogies are absolutely amazing, definitely the best pierogies I've ever had. They are small and flavorful and they will heat up any kind you like.    We had the potato and cheese and the potato and jalape√±o(this one was our definite favorite!   The chicken schnitzel was also flavorful and satisfying.  If you're looking for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal, European Delight is the place to go.    We had a tough time finding it but it's located on the lower floor of the St Lawrence Market(also a great spot!)   Should have bought a frozen bag a 50 to bring home with! So sad I didn't! =("}
