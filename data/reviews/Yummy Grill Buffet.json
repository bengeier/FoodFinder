{"text":"Okay, so with a name like Yummy Buffet I had to check it out.   The restaurant  is clean and nicely decorated and the waitresses are ON TOP OF THINGS! Whenever I went for more food I came back to old plates removed and my soda filled!  The food selection is decent, typical Asian Buffet. The sushi (at lunch anyway) was basically variations of the same rolls, but they all tasted good and fresh.   The dodgiest area can be the desserts, the area where they have the little cakes and puddings, not the fruit and jello area, that's all good! The little cakes they offer tend to be rather dry, and one just didn't taste right, but they had a super yummy banana pudding that made up for it all.   So $7.99 for a very Yummy lunch overall, at Yummy Buffet!"}
{"text":"Place looks nice and clean, service is good and people are nice.  Food is okay, a lot of selection but not sure if I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I liked the previous buffet. This one was nasty. There was a lot of food but I didn't like any of it. And I'm no snob, I'm normally an equal-opportunity food lover! The lo-mein is soggy and the \"orange chicken\" tastes nothing like orange chicken and was sitting in a couple inches of watery substance. I would take Panda Express over this place any day!"}
{"text":"You know what you are walking into when you decide to eat at a chinese buffet. Of course it is not going to be some gourmet Asian fusion cuisine; just the good ol' basics, well actually americanized basics that we have all come to crave from time to time. You know, sweet & sour chicken, fried rice, beef & broccoli, potstickers, crab wontons, etc. As long as you understand this concept then you will not be disappointed! They have tons of choices... Mongolian BBQ.... Sushi (not my favorite obviously for the reason explained previously but decent enough)...and hand scooped ice cream. I particularly enjoyed the walnut shrimp and hot and sour soup. Crab legs at dinner and it's only $11.99 per person for dinner (lunch is $7.99). Service is great too so don't be cheap when it comes to tipping because its a buffet. Would you want to clear a table full of crab-leg shells, spilled butter, filthy napkins and greasy utensils on more than one occasion within one dining experience? Worse than fine dining tables I am sure...;)"}
{"text":"We found our new buffet! We used to only go to Crazy Buffet because hubby wants sashimi, but since this place has it, we'll come here instead. It's newer and closer than Crazy Buffet. The food is pretty much on par with most other buffets, as far as taste goes. I got my buffet for free because it was my birthday, and I think dinner price is around 12 bucks. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely have experienced better.  Not even comparing to Bay Area buffets, but if you want a better place to go in the area-ish, I think, Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet is the place to go!  Regular, standard buffet food.  Nothing special, nothing exceptionally terrible.  But it felt that food trays weren't very plentiful and kept at the very bare minimum.  They had a decent amount of sushi items to select from, but again, nothing special.  They had a bunch of ice creams to select from that you scoop out yourself out of the freezer.  Plush fresh fruit, yum.. strawberries.    Plus is that it's in a nice looking shopping center and from the outside it looks more like an appliance store than asian buffet."}
{"text":"My son wanted to try this place.  I said, \"The Yelp reviews aren't very good.\"  I should have listened to what I read!  The place is nice looking and clean; however, we wanted to eat.  The food was very disappointing.  When you think of a buffet you think, \"I'm going to stuff myself!\" and \"I'm going to eat more than I paid!\"  Not this time.  I ate very little as nothing looked very good and it tasted worse.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Service is great, restaurant is clean, my advice: do NOT eat here.   Food is very mediocre, I've had better food at the local Panda Express or better yet spend your $$ across the street at YC's Mongolian Grill."}
{"text":"I'd say this is a somewhat clean restaurant for a buffet place and plenty of selection. However, everything I tried tasted horrible.... Most of them were fried food but were cold when should be warm to hot... sushi was soggy, cake ( desert ) tasted like they were out for display for a long time. I just felt bad for bringing my family here... My 6 yo son did not like the food either and only had a plate full of salad and ice cream:( I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice price for dinner & lots of sushi options. I would like to go back!"}
{"text":"Its a Chinese Buffet with some actual decent freshly made sushi. You have to take into consideration the cost of things when you leave these reviews!  $10 folks. Let's be real here. Its a chinese buffet. Lots of frozen things deep fried and a huge selection of it.   NOt terrible."}
