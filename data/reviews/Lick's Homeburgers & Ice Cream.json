{"text":"WOW no wonder this location has a such low rating!! its only because of its employees. EXTREMELY RUDE!!!!  This was the first time i have ever been to Licks.   Me and my friend had 1 combo of Chick'n Lick'n and just the sandwich; well i guess that was the spelling! anyways the sandwich was ok. but the fries were all short and cold. So i told one of the employ (one of the biggest mistake u could ever make at this location) and they say thats how they are! then the manager comes... The funny thing is, that he says the same thing. After that they say they cant take it back because its been touched! so cant reuse it. LOL REALLY????  So they gave me onion rings instead. After a huge argument.   In my opinion i think this restaurant: Sorry THIS LOCATION is hopeless and few of the employees need to learn proper customer service."}
{"text":"See my reviews of the Lick's location in Oakville to read about how unbelievably amazing their nature burger is.   This location, though stocked to the brim with Licks goodness is missing the authentic feel that the other Lick's locations have. Here they play 80's and 90's music, rather than hits from the 50's. There is no ice cream parlour, something that adorns every other location I've been to.  So definitely come here and mow down on some grub but if you're looking for a more authentic Licks experience I suggest hitting up the Beaches location of any of the 3 in Oakville."}
{"text":"A better quality of fast food hamburger/homeburger  joint!  burger was huge, meat was a bit on dry side.  Fries was just Fries.   Onion rings alot better.  combo came out to $10.30 ish."}
{"text":"Lick's was my family's fast-food restaurant of choice when I was growing up, so I hardly feel it's fair for me to evaluate the food: to me, theirs is the platonic ideal of a take-out hamburger. As has been mentioned elsewhere, this location is an \"Express,\" which seems to mean it's small; I don't really care, because we always get ours to-go, anyways.  I'm writing because this particular location has an amazing deal: the \"dinner and a movie\" combo. For $10 you get any combo - generally $8-9 on its own - plus a movie pass for the Bloor and a 6-month membership. The ticket can be used for any movie, any time, not just the day you eat at Licks. We get this combo every time we go, whether we feel like seeing a movie or not, and then save the tickets for whenever we do want to go. $2 movie tickets are hard to beat!"}
{"text":"One of the best nature burgers money can buy, and they have olives as free toppings! The onion rings seem to have changed, chipped bits of onions battered vs a ring so they don't get as crispy on the outside, fries were great.  My boyfriend enjoyed his home burger as well.  Much better than hero burger, wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trouble of driving to this restaurant to eat a fried frozen patty.. Go to the grocery store, buy a package of Lick's frozen burgers, fry up a patty, squirt on some Guk! (also from supermarket) and there you go. You just saved yourself about $12 and the privilege of wondering how clean is that worn out old wood banister? Shudder!"}
{"text":"EDIT: This location along with a bunch of other Lick's Burgers seems to have closed due to lease issues.  This is my favourite local burger joint. Clean, not too crowded, and nice to sit at. Not as cheap as McD's or something but reasonably priced and sometimes they give some pretty good coupons.  Anyways, you get to pick your toppings like at Harvey's which is pretty great. I like the garlic mayo they have and they have a few other interesting ones like some spicy type of relish or chipotle BBQ sauce. But it's mainly about the patty....their burger patty is nice thick and juicy and never has that frozen or inconsistent feel to it. It doesn't have much of a kick but not everyone wants that. They also have wraps though not a tonne of sides (mainly onion rings, fries, poutine). I haven't had it yet but the veggie nature burger looks good and I think this location has halal burgers as well (I'm not sure which items are and aren't but something is because I heard someone ordering it). I haven't tried the ice-creams but the flavours seem like they're more catered towards children.  This is in the North West corner so a bit out of the way for many and if you don't live near by then it wouldn't hurt to know what's around it. There's a FutureShop, Starbucks, and a Chuck E Cheese in the same plaza and Home Depot across the street. and on the other side of Winston Churchill there are plenty of shops (Walmart, Superstore, Winners, Dollar Store, Bulk Barn, Staples, and other places to get food and desert like a Tim Hortons)"}
{"text":"This is the best in the city! When I was a kid, I loved in the Beaches and Lick's was the place that everyone went to on the weekends. It is so lively. They sing every order and all the cool teenagers worked there.  Now, it seems a bit dated, but their Nature Burger still beats every other tofu burger on the market.  There are a few locations, but the Beaches is by far the best one."}
{"text":"Lick's (at least this one, anyway) has recently replaced its big and colourful hand-drawn menus with a bank of LCD screens displaying the menu and pictures of the items. It's a bit weird, since the rest of the decor--twenty-five-year-old newpaper clippings, etc.--is the same as always. The staff seemed a bit more subdued than the last time I was there, too. However, the food is as good and gut-filling as ever."}
{"text":"Desperately craving my fix of cow, I headed to Lick's in search of the perfect burger. Yes, a real beef burger (as opposed to the fake veggie kind that I usually consume).  I had avowed not to be won over by the oh-so-delicious nature burger, and instead to venture into the wonderful world of good, old fashioned ground beef. You know, the kind that comes from cows...  A party awaited and I didn't want the usual pre-drink sushi (and the next morning's aftermath). Figured it'd be wise to go for something a little more substantial.   Jennifer meet THE HOMEBURGER.  A premium patty of lean ground beef, seasoned and grilled to perfection.   It had been a long time coming. Oh how I missed you!   Overall, Lick's is a great chain. It's fun, consistent and friendly. At the Spadina location, the flat screen TVs mounted on the wall above the cashier as you first walk into the restaurant give the impression that the Lick's Hamburgers chain must not be doing too poorly!   I love the bright red tables, how the staff, fully clad in matching uniforms yell out your order to one another and how you can put as many pickles on your hamburger as you'd like.   I actually can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"When I first moved here, there was much hype about going to a Lick's. But if you strip down to what it is all about: a burger, it's hardly \"all that and a bag of chips\". More accurately, some of this and a couple of chips...  But I digress.  There's something about the seasoning that doesn't make a Lick's burger my burger of choice, like an unnecessarily extra amount of pepper. And when you ask for your burger with cheese it's a shredded blend (WIN) that's piled high on the bun (FAIL).*  And though the staff playfully carnival-barks your order, this particular location could use a Lobby Bobby wiping down tables and keeping it clean. It feels sticky... like, everywhere!  *Yes, I'm someone who only eats cheese that's melted nicely on her food."}
{"text":"Had high expecations with the Lick's I remember from my youth. This burger is lick's in name only. Had 8oz burger wth fries. Burger patty seems be full of filller and little flavour. So many other great burger chains out there. Even A&W and Harvey's better than this one. So disappointed. Better off going to Five Guys across the street"}
{"text":"I love Lick's in general, they make great food as far as fast food goes. They are also one of the few chains with a vegan burger and they even have a separate grill and set of tongs for them.  The staff at this location have always been good to us. Once, we were coming home late and it was a close call as to whether or not we would make it before they closed, so we called ahead and they said they would stay open. They even took down what we wanted so that if they were close to closing up they could start making it before we got there.  Yes, it was nice when they used to sing, and I wish they would stop raising their prices, but the quality and size of the burgers is much bigger than at other fast food places so I am willing to pay the higher price."}
{"text":"I don't like eating this food (I think the nature burger is over-rated), but I will never turn down an ice cream cone. I had strawberry - it was very light and fluffy, and made with real strawberries (so the sign says). I wanted to get this dark chocolate ice cream that came with cashews, but it was 'premium' and cost $1 extra ... that sounded a bit ridiculous to me.   FYI They don't sing out your orders anymore... remember when they used to sing?"}
{"text":"The burgers are still good, but Licks is not what it was years ago.  The onion rings are overpriced for the amount that you get, though they are good.  The atmosphere is average.  It used to be kitchy to have the singing etc go on occasionally, but it be came rather forced and embarrassing in recent years.  I'm not sure they're doing as much of it now.  The ice-cream is good."}
{"text":"I'm always surprised at how much people love Lick's.  I mean, sure, it's decent far as far as the fast-food set is concerned (and when compared to the charbroiled hockey pucks at Harvey's, it's damn near heavenly).  But I am still puzzled because it is both mediocre and pricey.  I think a big part of it is the fact that I know a lot of vegetarians.  And as someone who has gamely bought the Nature Burger both in store and in the frozen grocery store variety, I do freely admit that's a tasty veggie burger.  But overall I'm not sure that I like Lick's enough to go again unless someone specially requests it.  For one thing, this particular location is brutally slow.  I have gone in at close to peak times and slower times of day, and either way it feels like you are waiting for an eternity.  You can take a seat and wait for your name to be called but overall I feel like they are trying to squeeze past the fast-food style in terms of overhead but with longer preparation times.  Also, as I mentioned the price - any given sandwich combo is going to round out to about ten bucks.  Hot dogs are around $4, a crime when there's a perfectly good vendor across the street selling them for 2.50.    The poutine is so-so, the burgers and veggie burgers are decent as I mentioned.  The \"taters and cream\" is about as good as it sounds...a little overkill on the toppings, and fries that can't really hold up to the deluge.  I haven't had the pleasure of trying Lick's ice cream but it seems popular with the kids."}
{"text":"Yeah, they're not what they used to be. The fresh toppings, and they were, could not save my veggie shoe leather when I was there, a week ago yesterday. This chain failed to move with the times and I think either need to throw in the towel, or rebrand and reinvest and rebuild. They were once great. But now are just a sad memory."}
{"text":"Given the gourmet burger trend around town ala burger priest.. I still think licks in the beach is pretty good.  Natureburger still unsurpassed anywhere for the \"vegetanarians\"....(I love'em)"}
{"text":"Lick's has probably the best burgers of any chain restaurant in Canada, but this particular location is not up to the same standard i am used to from other Lick's locations in the GTA. I have been to the Queensway location 3 times and every time something just wasn't right : the service was slow, orders were mixed up, tables dirty etc .... this place needs new management ...."}
{"text":"One of the better chain burger joints and the burgers are filling. I gotta say, at around $13 the burger/fries/soda combo is definitely far too pricey for a fast food restaurant.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I've tried their veggie burgers and they're actually kind of unreal."}
{"text":"Decemburger Fail.  Some things just aren't what they used to be.  I grew up in the suburbs east of Toronto where Lick's got its start, so I've always been partial to the chain for sentimental reasons.  I even had a stretch where I dined at Lick's almost daily.  Needless to say, I was excited to put my hometown favourite up against Toronto's finest burgermongers and see who came out a winner.  Lick's, regrettably, took a licking.  I think the whole singing and cheering shtick Lick's was once known for has worn off.  When I ordered my Homeburger with cheese combo, the cashier sighed like an exhausted pony being prodded for one more mile before shouting to the kitchen \"one and one\" (said combo's Lickname).  No enthusiasm, and I don't blame her.  It was about 3PM on a Saturday, and the store was not at all busy.  Notwithstanding the fact that there were at least three people working and at most eight customers in the store, the dining area was messy.  Also, considering it's a burger joint, the napkins were lousy - thin and inabsorbent.  Before I even made it to the dining room, Team Lick's managed to (briefly) mix up my order with that of the woman in front of me.  Even worse, the grill-monkey and cashier-doubling-as-dresser were so disorganized that my cooked patty sat, lonely, aside the grill for at least a minute and a half before a third staffer paired it with my dressed-and-waiting bun and sent me on my way."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that the last time I went to this venue was quite a few months ago, however m'lady and I both felt rather ill after eating there, so there's the chance we got food poisoning from there. They didn't have iced tea, and when requested pickles on the side, they forgot to serve. They also only had vegetarian chili in the freezer, which turned m'lady off of it, which is actually the main reason that we went there.  So all-in-all, compared to a typical Lick's chain, this venues wasn't the best for us, and I'd be quite unlikely to be returning to it."}
{"text":"I hate to sound cliche, but Lick's really isn't what it used to be. In the late 90's and early 2000's you didn't go to lick's for the food only, it was a whole experience. The places were busy and lively, with attentive staff, who even sang to you. The whole vibe was upbeat and fun, the food was even pretty good too. But lick's has made a couple mistakes that lead to their current state of affair.   Lick's (the corporation) decided to, like a call girl, sell itself. Their homeburgers began appearing on store shelves in grocery stores. This was a big slap in the face to any franchisee's. Now people could have lick's burgers at home, for cheap, thus eliminating the need to visit any of the storefront locations. But wait... at least they still had the fun environments within the restaurants right? Wrong. This stopped soon afterward as well. Servers now speak normally, as they would anywhere else.   A meal there nowadays isn't horrible. The burgers okay, the fries are okay. Nothing wonderful, and no excitement whatsoever. Decor sucks, but everyone already knows that. Service is disappointing when compared to the way it used to be.  Stop by if you're feeling nostalgic (I guess), or if there's nothing else around and you just want some standard food."}
{"text":"It's like they've given up. Just passed by with my family. The food was okay but the service was sub-par. No hello, no smiles, no thank you. It's like they were doing us a favour serving us. Probably wondering why they are empty at 7pm. It's too bad... I used to like the chain."}
{"text":"Overall it was OK. The same quality That they've always had, but honestly the fun's been lost.   The woman that took our order said the right words to the cook (you know, the way they always have), but there was absolutely no fun - it came out in a monotone.   Then the cook was on his cell phone while cooking our food. It tasted OK, but something's been lost along the way....  Then there's the bad late 70's & early 80's music...  It's really too bad, it used to be great, now it's just another burger place...."}
{"text":"A step up from a Harvey's veggie burger, Lick's Nature Burger is a delicious pattie that lets you indulge in fast food with some taste. Like Harvey's, you can specify what you want toppings-wise on your burger, and the selection is usually pretty decent variety- and quality-wise.  As well as the veggie burger there's some 'healthy' sides (salads 'n' such) and there's even an option of sweet potato fries now. But I don't think i've ever been in a Lick's (or any other burger joint) and seen someone order salad. The healthier options are there though. They also have a small chest freezer with packaged Lick's products if you want to recreate the magic at home.  This location has pretty decent and prompt service - there's usually one person out front who is unbelievably cheery to the point of weirdness. Plenty of seating, which is very nice come winter time when you want that big ol' comfort food combo. Make mine with rings!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just found out about the Veggielicious Festival (http://www.veggielicious.ca/) today, and since we're in the area twice a week for work out night, we had to find somewhere nearby that was participating in Veggielicious so would could support them!  We chose Lick's because we wanted a fast food chain to know there was demand for vegetarian options.    Veggie burgers and chili fries? Sign me up!   For a fast foodish type place we really enjoyed ourselves.  I had never been to a Lick's before, so it was kind of neat to see what all the fuss was about.  First of all, the burgers are HUGE.  (No, really.  Even the veggie burger.)  And after you place your order you head to the counter for a Subway (choose your toppings) style meet and greet with your burger.  It was pretty good for a fast food place.  I'd like to just include a disclaimer right here- I gave it three stars not because of the service or food, necessarily.  I just didn't really like it all that much.  I'm sure this is because I'm used to eating homemade, and I just feel like I should admit that freely.     Both my husband and I like our homemade bean burgers (and homemade fries) for a fraction of the price, but it's nice to know that if we're out with friends we have options at Lick's.    If you like burger joints and greasy food, this seems like a nice place for you."}
{"text":"We went there last month since we bought a WagJag deal.  When we were trying to order, we were told that they don't accept the deal for combos. That was not part of their restrictions when we bought the deal! My husband mentioned this, but they didn't care.  So we had to order something else.   We ended up getting the Homeburger with cheese and Poutine. The food was OK. I have had better, I have had worse.  I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Original Lick's from the 80's prior to the ownership converting to pastuerized processed frozen burger patties for mass production and distribution purposes, was insanely good! How good? Well in my search for the best burger, I have not found anything in Toronto that even comes close. I remember biting in to the juicy back homebugers with the juices dripping down my forearms. The flavour was insane. The Yonge street location across from Eaton Centre was the best. There poutine was untouchable with their St Huberts style gravy. If they brought back the original recipe back, I think it would destroy the competition and disrupt the market."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill big time.  Overpriced for what you get.  Spent $12 on a combo, got about 6 onion rings and a burger which was pretty cold, it didn't even melt the cheese it was put directly on top of.  Friend got a chili poutine and drink, came up to $9.50, huge rip-off.  Do not go here if you want a good burger."}
{"text":"Everyone likes Licks, and honestly I have no reason why.  I should say that normally i would give at least two stars for this place, but the service was so horrible when I was there that I really can't.  The Food; Greasy, tasteless.  I really dont know what is so delicious about these burgers.  The texture is weird, the taste just isn't there.    The Service: Horrible.  When I was there, their debit machine was down, but they made no mention of this to anyone in line.  And everyone who wanted to try their debit card did....even though the machine was obviously down.  This resulted in a ridiculously long line.  If your debit machine is down, just say so, announce it, post it.  Dont just keep trying it over and over again!  Price: Overpriced.  You can get better, cheaper food at other generic burger joints around Toronto."}
{"text":"From my Veggie Chronicles on Facebook. It's hard to evaluate LOVE!   Nature Burger @ LICKS: -Fresh toppings: lettuce, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, hot peppers, relish, olives, ketchup, bbq sauce and mustard -Patty: juicy, soft, tasty, thick -Price: ~$5 after taxes (just the burger) -Verdict: it was completely satisfying. Skip the cheese and mayo for a vegan option. Ask for a whole wheat bun for a healthier alternative (but I think they come standard). Licks' veggie burgers will never disappoint!  FYI, I'm not evaluating the restaurant, although I've never really cared about the service. C'mon, it's fast food people, what kind of service do you actually expect? You order the burger, name your toppings, they put the toppings on for you, you grab your burger and chow down. It's not like a 5-star restaurant where you can actually expect excellent service, it's part of the 5-star dining experience!"}
{"text":"I remember when I was a kid, every so often I would go to a Lick's restaurant with my family.  The whole experience was great, employees were very live, cheerful and singing while making your order...it was very entertaining.  As the years past, more and more locations started to close which made me a bit sad because that was one of the few places I went to that reminds me of my childhood. Fast forward to last weekend...  I was in the area and I was looking for a place to eat. I couldn't narrow it down to one location, but when I saw Lick's I thought I'd give it a shot for nostalgic reasons. In a way, I wanted to relive my experience that I had when I used to go to Lick's as a child. As soon as I entered, the place was near empty (during 5pm on a Saturday with only one person seated and two employees working). I figured I would still give it a shot since I'm here for the food as well.  The cashier that took my order seemed very displeased to be there - very far from welcoming. After I placed my order, I observed on how the atmosphere had change for the worst. There was no lively, cheerful and singing employees...just older ladies which are very quiet and no where near the atmosphere that I dined with my family years ago.  My food came and I was hoping the first bite would take me back to how delicious their Homeburger used to be for me but instead, I got THE worst burger I ever ate in my life.  The beef patty was burned on the outside which added an unwanted crunchy taste to it and the inside of the beef was dryer than the Sierra desert.  I just couldn't believe how bad my experience was and if my experience is the same with the few Lick's locations left in the city, I don't see them lasting for another year.   My memory of the Lick's brand is forever tarnished and it's highly unlikely I would be back even if the meal was free.  If there was anything positive that came out of this situation is that my horrible experience inspired me to write my first Yelp review on how my childhood experience of Lick's was ruined at this Warden/ Eglinton location."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Licks a few times and gotten take out for the family here.  This is the express version of licks designed with less seating and a hope that you will get takeout.    Normally we go for the gobbler (turkey) burgers, which we thoroughly enjoy.  They have the usual assortment of condiments and garnishes, plus a few of their own.  The kids meals are well received in my household.  All kids meals are boxed and include a coupon for an ice cream.  I would highly suggest the monkey banana ice cream.  The atmosphere is gone from licks.  They used to sing and have an entertainment factor to your meal.  Ever since the flagship location near the Eaton Center they stopped the singing chain wide.  This is really just another burger joint now."}
{"text":"Licks is the restaurant of my youth.  Homeburger combos with extra Guk (the garlicky mayo) that Licks has made famous are firmly entrenched in my earliest moments of consciousness, and it pains me to the core to give it two stars.  This rating is not reflective of the Licks of yesteryear, it is however indicative of what it has become.    With Hero Burger and South St. Burger Co. vying to take respective bites out of Toronto's upscale burger market Licks cannot rest on it's laurels, however strong they may be.  Founder Denise Meehan describes Licks as having a  \"A nice gay uplifted atmosphere,\" and attributes this as setting it apart from competitors  I'm not even joking.   I think that Ms. Meehan and Co. should focus less on atmosphere and more on what brought people through the doors in the first place, their burgers.  It is safe to say that Licks jumped the proverbial shark when they registered the Homeburger and inked a deal to sell a slew of Licks products to A&P, Dominion, Food Basics, Ultramart, The Barn Markets and Loeb stores.  I get they wanted to strengthen their retail niche, but they have undeniably done so by focusing less on their product at the store level.  I find Licks to be a truly mediocre experience at best.  Gone are the days when the \"coolest\" guys in school manned the grill organically belting out tunes while slinging high quality Homeburgers with reckless abandon. These days of yore have been replaced by gimmicky contrived performances and a sub par product that simply tries to pawn itself off as the original Homeburger.  Licks has been a victim of it's own inherent success and for this I am truly sorry."}
{"text":"I wound up with a Groupon for this place and was excited to go for a burger. I gotta say, it just was not doing it for me, even for half price.   The burgers are not that good and the fries were simply bad. I would pass on this place."}
{"text":"Yelp ratings system gives the suggestion for 1 star as \"Eek! Me thinks not.\" Darn tootin right I think not with Lick's!  Stopped by here for drive thru recently. First off, the person taking our order seemed annoyed with us, as if we had made her go into work that day. Now, I don't take rudeness well, especially when I'm hungry. I asked her if she knew me. Puzzled, she said no. I then replied she should them get the attitude out of her voice as I didn't choose her job for her, that SHE chose to work in customer service & should act accordingly. We got out of there as quick as we could; And as annoyed as I was, I truly thought the service might be worth the burger. Darn tootin no!  I ordered a homeburger with my usual toppings, got to my friend's condo in less than 10 min to eat & head back out. The burger wasn't good. There was no flavour & the meat felt overcooked and dried out. I also realized the last slice of the tomato was put in my burger which I absolutely hate! I ate about 60% of the burger before I gave up. I didn't order any fries or drink; I'm darn tootin glad I didn't in case the fries were as bad as the burger.  I was very disappointed especially spending my hard earned money on a place that had established itself as having good burgers. I think Lick's has been licked by their competitors. That's the darn tootin truth!*  * not enough sleep + grumpy over burger = overuse of corny catchphrase"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever going to a licks. I ended up ordering the 8oz burger and onion rings combo.   The food wasn't bad. I had high expectations of the patty because my husband kept telling me how amazing Licks was when he used to go a few years back. After having the burger not sure what his burger expectations were. The burger was not super juicy but the flavour was just ok. It was nothing to write home about. However, this could of changed if they didn't go skimpy on the sauces I asked for. The onion rings were very good, light golden crispy batter was delicious.   I would try it again but maybe extra sauce next time."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are nasty. We couldn't finish them because of taste and we had to go somewhere else to eat. The fries are good and its a Lick's that serves Falafel and Swarmas, very strange, i wouldnt go there if u wanted real Lick's hamburgers."}
{"text":"The other reviews here do not represent my experience at all! Lick's decor is dated, but there is no better place for burgers and fries. The food was first rate, the restaurant was clean and the washrooms were spotless. I wish all fast food places were half as good."}
{"text":"So so sad. Licks was the best and the food here still tastes relatively good compared to McDonald's or Bking but the produce does not look fresh and there was only one guy serving everything and doing cash. How the best has fallen, there is a Burger Priest next door which I'm sure is going to put the final sword into this one great Toronto icon. I am weeping into my 'guk' sauce :(  The place is now closed."}
{"text":"I once made the stupid mistake of wanting to go to Lick's website and thinking I knew the URL.  Well as it turned out, it wasn't a family hamburger restaurant website I was directed to, but rather an adult site with no relation to food. A little embarrassing side note.   This location of Lick's is called Lick's Express. I'm not sure what makes the restaurant an \"express\" version. True, it's smaller than most Lick's, there aren't as many seats in the store, so maybe I'm guessing that differentiates. I've always been a big fan of Lick's. I missed their 21 cent or 23 cent days, where they would have one item on the menu for that price on the 21st or 23rd day of every month, but I figured that wouldn't last too long anyways.   Their veggie burgers, bar-none are one of the best fast food restaurant-style veggie burgers I've had ever in my life.  And trust me, I've had my fair share of veggie burgers.  The great thing about Lick's is that the grill their veggie burgers on a separate part of the grill than they grill the meat variety ones. They also use separate utensils as well. I'm not really one of those picky people, but I appreciate the effort.    Lick's constantly has coupons and specials (i.e buy a fries and drink and get a homeburger for $1), so always be on the lookout for those. Even when you buy a meal, often times they'll give you coupons back.  My recommendation is that if you haven't given Lick's veggie burger a try, it's worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Any form of explanation should be made available to a menu that is not straightforward with food names, such as Chick'n Lick'n, or The Works. Needless to say, it would have been excusable if the staff was at least willing enough to give a quick explanation of their four specialty poutines for example - but apparently, such request was beyond their capacity. I was told that I was asking too much, and to inquire only about one flavor.   ...And did I mention how I was constantly negated about ordering the weightless platters, despite telling the cashier twice, that was what I wanted? I would like cottage cheese and fruits, yes?  We've been trying to eat in this branch, but we always arrive a little bit later than their closing time. And when we finally got the chance, the dining experience was not even worth it.  Good thing 'The Works' worked. The food saved it by a margin."}
{"text":"Another Friday lunch mission to Scarborough. This time we decided to see how well Lick's could stand up compared to the Five Guys burgers down the street that we had visited a few weeks back. My opinion is a bit skewed as I decided to have a turkey burger on this lunch time stop, but I had a few people who at the beef \"Homeburger\" to keep things balanced.  The store itself is pretty clean, and had ample seating. There were only 3 people in line when we got there but it was at least 20 minutes before I had ordered and received our food back. The service was all pretty unpersonable at ordering, but at least while standing waiting at the topping area the woman said some pleasantries.  As for the food... As mentioned, I had the Gobbler (aka Turkey Burger - $5.49) with cheese (+$0.99), and back bacon (1 slice = $1.49). The sandwich was decent, but in all honesty I buy the Lick's Gobbler burgers at the grocery store and cook at home, and maybe its because Im using a flame barbecue, but I'd take that over the sandwich that was served up to me today. My dining companions who ate the Homeburger said that while being a decent burger, was not as good as Five Guys, and was overall a bit dry. The fries are also a losing situation. The quality was some of the most boring fries I've had in my life. Lots of salt and ketchup required to make it through the order.  In the end it was a $15 lunch that did provide the sustenance required to make it through the rest of the day, but reminded me to just stick with buying Lick's burgers at the grocery store and cooking them at home and save my dining out money for something better."}
{"text":"We found this place when we went driving on the Queensway the other day (We had heard there was a Big Yellow Wacky, Waving Arm Inflatable tube man out there, which there was a few blocks from Licks)   I love Licks, The Vegan Burger tastes too much like meat for me!!! But for my husband, I think he LOVED THAT! For me, it was meaty, kind of freaking me out.   my food was decent, as was the price. I wish they offered the garlicy Mayo in a Nayonaise or Veganaise option. The fries were not very warm.   This location does not have any singing, or shoutinng going on. Not when we went there anyway. Andrew, was very polite as was Elora. I miss the singing. I miss the excitement.   Also, the music playing was amazing. I want a copy of whatever they had on. Good music made the not so hot fries warmer!!   I would have given a 4 if the fries were piping hot and the voices were vocalizin'   On Monday's they have a 2 can dine deal for $12.99 Super Cheap for a lunch for 2!"}
{"text":"Dung on a bun anyone?  That's what the sign should read at Lick's.  Calling what they put on a bun meat is very misleading.  I don't quite know what that brown pattie was but I'm pretty sure it was about 50% nitrites with some sort of filler to hold it together.  I'm on about my fifth gallon of water because I feel like I've eaten a hunk of Buck crunch and a block of salt lick all at the same time.    I placed my order at the counter and the gal who took my order  SCREAMS it out literally at the top of her lungs.  Holy mutha of gawd.  I am completely deafened because she didn't even turn to the grill area to call the order, she just looked straight at me and gave 'er.  My ears are still ringing.  I looked at her and told her that they needed to change the name of the franchise to Prick's for being so damn rude and bullhorning people in the face with their big mouths.  Is that really necessary?  It is not funny and it is not entertaining.    I'm gonna add those ear phones to my xmas list that everyone here has been talking about on that conversation reel.    As for Lick's, the next time I'm in the mood for some Buck crunch I'll just go to Bass Pro shops and hang out in the hunting section.  Someone pass me a bucket of water please."}
{"text":"i was living one major city block away from this lick's when it first opened and was so psyched, enough to claim that id be going there all the time.  well if i had enough money to eat out every day of the week and didnt care if i smelled and looked like a hamburger this might just be the burger joint where id do it.  ive loved licks burgers since the first one i tried (back in the days when we didnt have internet...).  at the time it was a nice gimmick how the people in the kitchen would sing along the orders to each other instead of just saying \"cheese burger and fries man.\"  now i gloss over it, no more than the kids who probably feel stupid saying it themselves.  this lick's is like any others for all intents and purposes.  its got the wood tables and chairs painted red, it has goofy cheesy signs and decorations hanging from the ceiling or posted on the wall and everything is bright.  thats all i care about recalling.  the burgers are pretty thick and juicy and they put freshly grated cheddar cheese, their special guk sauce - probably just mayo and ketchup and relish - and the rest of the condiments are pretty standard.  somehow though its pretty tasty each time.  sometimes i find the fries are wanting though - but thats only if ive ordered with my brain and not my eyes.  if my eyes order, i not only order a homeburger with cheese and bacon, but i get their Taters N' Cream which is fries, cheddar, sour cream, bacon bits & chives.  just plain stupid.  but good.  so i say get it all to go, or hell, go pick it up in the supermarket and bbq at home, because they sell it there too. (in packages in the freezer, with no singing.)"}
{"text":"So I'm going to give a review here for what Lick's WAS and not what it became.  As a kid...like many others...when I visited Toronto, I was told that I had to try this place. My Mom took me in the first time and my experience was surreal and incredible.  All the staples of a 1950's imaginary Burger/Shake spot existed here - with amazingly friendly staff, great food choices but truly - the best Burgers (beef and chicken) that I have ever had. Ingredients were also hyper fresh and delicious.  Then one day...Lick's started to open up all over the place...franchising...and I think around that growth point - they started to...um...PASTEURIZE their meat - which completely changed the flavor.   Plus I could not longer get my burger medium rare. It didn't even taste like Burger anymore. More like filler.  They tried to change with the times as I hear...but whoever the CEO was didn't get what made Lick's great - a delicious burger made of REAL meat, cooked perfectly by a bunch of nutty singing kids with great energy - and incredible bun/toppings/sodas/floats in a visually appealing pop-50's environment.  I want to thank whoever the original owner was for those years of amazing food and great experiences with friends and family.   And sorry that they forgot what they were doing sometime down the road.  If I was an investor, I would open up a new one and call it ORIGINAL LICKS - and go right back to the very first business model. Change nothing. And have success once more."}
{"text":"I usually like Licks so I was surprised when I visited here not too long ago. I ordered the regular homeburger combo. I was not impressed. It didnt taste the,same, the burger was dry and the fries were not good. I just recently started buying the Licks burgers at the store. When I cooked them on my own Licks is once again redeemed!"}
{"text":"The place is set up a differentiator where you can customize or make your own burger but there isn't really anything different. If you head to Five Guys and A&W, perhaps you'll get a comparable experience. The staff is quite friendly but need to show some passion around why this place is different - is there a Licks culture that sets it apart from the rest? Perhaps. I tried the chicken burger and it was fine. The concept is good and the name is fancy but am sure they can make the place even better."}
{"text":"probably the most overrated burger place in Toronto.  The burgers are good sure, but they are exactly the same in terms of quality as any other fast food/diner burger.  Not to mention this place is slightly more expensive than those generic burger joints.  There's nothing special about this place, don't believe any of the hype."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Toronto, I was told that you have, HAVE, to go to a Lick's burger.  I had kept this in the back of my mind and when I found myself in the Beaches area of Toronto, I happened across the Licks location there.  Time for lunch.  The bright open area for dining consists of a collection of tables surrounded by murals of ice cream, burgers, all vividly painted like a newborn's bedroom wall.  It's definitely a fun place and it's aimed at kids.  From the ice cream bar to the fact that the servers sing your orders to the cooks, it's a place that's alive with electrical fun.  Don't let the interior fool you.  Yes, there is a childlike element to it, but the burgers are the thing.  Large, fresh, and tasty, once you select your condiments, you can find a seat, unwrap your meal, and enjoy a tasty burger to the tune of people behind the counter singing about cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"Licks is generally good.  The employee was a bit hostile... And a bit overly aggressive."}
{"text":"If this location is anything to go by I now know why they are closing locations across Ontario.  My son ordered a side salad instead of fries which was a .60 cent upgrade.  It came in a tiny plastic container which was so small he couldn't mix in the Rene's packaged salad dressing they gave him (no low cal/fat options by the way).  They forgot to give him the water he ordered and when he went back the girl filled a cup from the tap!!!    The restaurant itself was completely deserted at 5:30 pm which should have been our first clue that something was wrong.  The fruit bowls on display had only two or three bits of fruit left in them and the staff of three appeared to be looking ahead to closing because they were already emptying serving containers of toppings out.  Ordered a weight less platter which included a larger salad with the remaining bits of fruit from those bowls I spoke about!!!  I asked for the bottle of water on the way out because with service like this I wasn't leaving without it."}
{"text":"The thing that is the most interesting about this location is the fact that they advertise that it's an EXPRESS version of the restaurant.  Waiting 15 minutes for your veggie burger does NOT equal express.  Good thing their veggie burgers are juicy and delicious otherwise I'd never go back.  At least I am the wiser now and don't bother hitting them up on a quick lunch break anymore.   I have no idea why it takes them so long to make something simple, since you know, it is a fast-food chain, and why every time I buy something it's a totally different price than the last time.  Still, I keep going back for more.    The veggie burger is so large and filling that buying a combo just seems ridiculous.  Now I'm totally on the mini-burger combo train.  It's literally the perfect amount of fries for a lady.  It still ends up costing like $6 bucks, but it's worth it when you don't feel like a bloated whale after eating.  Instead it's perfectly fulfilling...and vegan.  Two thumbs up for the burger, zero for service."}
{"text":"First of all I am a fan of licks for many years,I see this location has opened up near my work,I decide to go in for a snack as soon as I get to the cash a black lady ask me what you want rudely ,I proceed to order the philly she says we don't got it ,I say jerk sandwich she says we don't got it,tells me just get a burger that's what you came for isn't it, I say no thanks I continue to look for a items that they do have she begins to tell me we talked about this yesterday Casper I've never been there before lol referencing me as a ghost (I'm white male) needless to say I'm offended and seriously questioning the professionalism of this location. Food sucked People don't go here there is no place for racism in this world especially in Canada ,overall just sad this happened to me . Peace and love"}
{"text":"Employee behind counter not very pleasant most of the time.  Doesn't change gloves after handling money.  Ewww.  Probably won't be back.  Have to tell friends about that.  It's a red flag for me."}
{"text":"I heart Licks.  It's quality goodness, and you can't beat the nature burger.  At this location they even sing without being asked (poor bastards).    It's by far the best  fast food burgers that I've had - and they have good ice cream too.  Speaking of which, if you decide to have a kids meal it includes a free cone too!"}
{"text":"I was taken here by a very good friend for whom this is one of their favorite places. Shhh .... don't tell him I only thought it was ok!  So it's a place that for fellow Americans I would compare perhaps to Five Guys or maybe Shake Shack, that \"fast casual\" type of burger joint, although from what I gather, Lick's has been around before the concept existed.  The burger was alright, but it was kind of on the meatloafy side. It seemed to have too much going on with it, and when you are throwing a lot of things to top a burger, it never feels like a good sign. I like mine pretty simple.  Still, it wasn't *bad.* I would rate it as being definitely superior to a true fast food chain, but with a lof of newer concepts coming around (see: the neighboring Burger Priest) this place isn't going to be long for the world."}
{"text":"Good: Burgers were nice & juicy. Bad: Onion rings were warm only (not hot) Ugly: Poutine's gravy was way too salty!"}
{"text":"2.5 to 3 stars because at least they're nice.   VIBE  The Danforth location is conveniently located to the subway so if you need to grab and run and you literally can do just that. The decor is very \"old time\" harkening back to the 50s soda shops of our day or looking for modern day Sandys and Dannys to sip on milkshakes.   The cashier is always smiling here. That said, the staff are young and someone is always in training here. This is why it takes 10 minutes for your order to be done. It's because the trainee doesn't know how to package up the bag. \"Burger first? Fries on top of burger?\" The correct answer is: Burger on bottom and fries beside. Where's my gold star?   I ATE  I always get the Turkey Burger here. This is also known as the \"Gobbler.\" This time it was much too charred. But they give me extra pickles so I was happy. I need to go back to the location in The Beach and see how it compares. Plus, they sing at that one. What happened to the singing?!  And as Chris P. said, the fries ARE fresh.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I'd be \"licking\" my fingers if my burger wasn't charred. But I understand turnover. That said, it's nice to see this Canadian company still kicking around in the proliferation of Hero Burgers and A&W joints popping up everywhere."}
{"text":"While Lick's is a bit pricey and doesn't exactly have the best food, the staff working at this location are extremely courteous and friendly. So much so that I'd actually consider coming back just for them.  For me, the burgers are a miss. They just don't taste good. The chicken tenders are much better, and the BBQ sauce they come with is fantastic. I can also vouch for the chocolate shakes."}
{"text":"Licks is an OK place to eat. The price is very high and does not match the quality of the food. I do enjoy going every now and again, but for the price it is definitely not very often."}
{"text":"I went here because it was close to where I'm staying and they have veggie burgers, even though they were the Boca burger style of fake meat that is not usually my favorite. I'm from the States, maybe the same company's called Nature burger here.  The fries were great. The only weird thing was that my cheese was added cold and shredded to my bun with the other fixin's. Back home we use slices and they are usually melted on. Maybe it's a Canadian thing."}
{"text":"The burgers and french fries are always really good and the staff was friendly but the sweet potato fries were very poorly made and the bathroom looked like something out of a horror movie."}
{"text":"This review is only based on one thing: the poutine special. It fell short, unfortunately. The fries were good, but they weren't topped with the requisite squeaky cheese curds, and gravy was just okay. On top of that, the serving was pretty tiny compared to their advertising poster.  You could get a poutine double that size for the same price ($5.00, including a drink) at any chip truck in eastern Ontario or Québec. Nice try, Licks, but no cigar. Maybe I'll stick to their famous burgers next time."}
{"text":"Lick's used to be great... like, 25 years ago when they still used fresh patties. Outsourced patties are dense and repugnant and taste rather like salty, prefabricated hotdog meat. I'd rather eat at McDonald's to be honest."}
{"text":"This is the second location I've been to since coming to Toronto (The first being The Beach).  Lick's burgers are good but not the best burger I've ever had by any means.  They are better than you traditional Wendy's or McDonald's though.  The burgers are good enough and the fries are always fresh.  I've never had a good experience with the onion rings sadly.  The place looks like its starting to show its age and the dining area isn't the cleanest.  Another downer on today's visit was that their debit machine wasn't working."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries. I wish I could just end the review at that, but that's not all Lick's has to offer.   As everyone else has illustrated, the employees along the line sing the orders, and if they're enthusiastic enough, they just sing all the time. Definitely entertaining when I was a child, as it is entertaining for all children, but if you're over the age of 12, it's really just kind of annoying.   Not to mention the bright decor and the kids toy section in a lot of the locations. Basically, if you aren't a child and you don't have children, you feel like one while you're in Lick's. The burgers are great, but get them to go. Now you can buy them frozen at the grocery store, as well as the Guk stuff, so you could really make the whole burger at home....what a concept. No singing!"}
{"text":"The nature burgers are vegan surprisingly. The gravy isn't meat based so it's safe for vegans/vegetarians especially if you're looking for a place to hang out with non veg friends."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers both vegan and not made however you want it.  They have a variety of toppings and sauces to choose from that blow away pretty much any burger joint in town.  The fries are well cooked and they have a separate grill and tongs for veggie burgers.  Look no further for a burger in Toronto.  My only wish is that they would expand outside of Ontario, but you can get their frozen veggie burgers at some Sobey's locations."}
{"text":"A Lick's is a Lick's is a Lick's. Or is it? I've only ever been to Express locations and as far as I know this is the only full service location in Toronto. A quick jaunt from Ashbridges Bay, this Lick's location has all the fixin's...the wild and zany decor, the singing staff, the sticky tables.   I made the near fatal mistake of ordering a Weightless Platter. Friends, don't order the Weightless Platter.   You may be tempted by the lure of cottage cheese, fruit and green salad but let me break it down for you: * the cottage cheese portion is about the size of a plum sauce container when you order chicken fingers, and the curds are woefully wimpy * the salad is really just five wilted lettuce leaves, one green pepper spear and a cherry tomato * you don't get to choose what you want on your burger patty (no bun). It just comes plain. Apparently \"weightless\" = \"condimentless\" too.  Apparently I'm on the Atkins diet?"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best veggie burgers in the city! Even the meat eaters among my friends have been known to come to Lick's just to order a veggie burger. Conveniently you can buy frozen patties at Metro (formerly Dominion) in packages of four if you want to recreate the experience at home, but definitely stop by this express location to try a freshly made one!"}
