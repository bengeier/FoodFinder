{"text":"If your into Dark & Dingy dive bars then you might like this place. It gives off a gloomy feeling because of all vagrants & old people, they have 2 pool tables & Cheap beer,lots of seating but I wouldn't eat here ever it's not that kinda place & don't ask the bartender to mix you a manhattan or any kind of cocktail it's not that kinda place either"}
{"text":"They offer two pool tables, but the bartender had no idea how to make a Malibu Hurricane.    The area is kinda seedy, and I definantly wouldn't go there for the food (as I have read recently that they have been given the yellow card twice from a health inspector).  Pool was all I came for and I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place again."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing based on my experience with them through Skip the Dishes. We ordered shrimp linguine, honey garlic wings with fries, cheesecake and a drink. . . Wow! The portions were HUGE and the food was delicious. I ordered new years eve and they seemed pretty busy yet the food quality didn't seem to suffer from it.  I'm so happy about how my meal tasted I have another order on the way."}
