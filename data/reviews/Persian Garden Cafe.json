{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner. The food is decent not great. Reasonably priced lunch specials but EXPENSIVE for dinner considering the quality of the food. Even their hummus is mediocre. Fantastic rose water honey lemonade I will say!! MAY go back for lunch. Don't have high expectations if YOU go."}
{"text":"Great place for VEGANS and meat-eaters!!! Everyone is so nice and helpful with choosing options, even desserts. Location is okay, wish they were in the East Valley though. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"The Persian Garden Cafe uses organic ingredients and they offer lots of vegan options in addition to meat dishes. Everything we tried was extraordinary. The owner told us that anything can be made vegetarian and the portions are generous. The service was great. If you like red wine, try their Pinot Noir from Oregon.  We had the vegetable and chicken stew, lentil soup, and the spinach stew. My taste buds were in seventh heaven. I have also had their food delivered and it was great."}
{"text":"Food is good, bottom line. And by good, I mean R E A L. There's not even salt on the table. This is a place to really put your taste buds to use while giving your body some of that tender, loving, nutrition it deserves and needs!  It's pricey though... which is a bummer, but again, it is real food, which is hard to find. All the veggies and herbs are fresh.   Service is sometimes lacking, depending on who is working... but again, REAL FOOD and LOCAL!   Treat yourself ;)"}
{"text":"I believe this is simply one of the best restaurants and best-kept secrets in the Phoenix area.  Honestly it is quite rare to be able to enjoy this type of Middle Eastern food in an organic, vegetarian, and healthy way. Most middle eastern restaurants create their flavors through excessive amounts of oil and fat. Not here. Fragrant and very aromatic food. I really enjoyed the spinach stew and the sabzi polo rice. While there are the traditional Persian dishes on the menu, there are also creative variants of Persian food including the use tofu. It does have meat on the menu but dedicates two pages to vegetarian entrees. Aside from the cuisine I think what separates this restaurant is the charming environment and personal attention from the chef and owner who often comes out and greets the guests.  This is a ma and pa restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Mahmud is a joy and very sweet. Highly recommended! The kabob was delicious,  excellent saffron rice. The honey lemonade was sublime on a hot summer day and Mahmud so sweet!"}
{"text":"We came to Persian Garden Cafe to begin our New Years Eve celebration. We enjoyed absolutely everything. The Persian Chai Tea had a lovely mild spice and rose flavor. We began the food with Sabzi, a dish of fresh herbs, feta, walnut, and olives. Our sever stated that Persians begin every meal (even breakfast) with Sabzi. I now officially want to adopt this practice. The Hummus and Baba Ganoush were also excellent.    For entrees we had a lamb stew special with pickled veggies that was packed with a sweet, yet mild, nutty flavor. We also had the Purpleshoots which consisted of asparagus, eggplant, rice, and a house made cucumber yogurt.   All in all the ambience, service, and food were absolutely stellar. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is one of my top favorite places. Always the most cheerful and fun staff! You cannot lose on the food and drink. Point your finger on the menu and you won't be disappointed. Lunch here is also choice."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Decide to try something new.  Food was good, not very salty, on the healthier side of spectrum.  I personally was expecting the food to have a little more robustness when it comes to flavor.   I had the eggplant pita, my coworker had the lamb stew."}
{"text":"Heaven for vegan .  Stay away from the meat.  Great desserts.  Take the Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"Lots of Vegan/Vegetarian Options. Owner is very friendly and seems genuinely appreciative of your business. Service is excellent. Portions are huge.  Have tried the Merza and Kookoo, Spinach Burger (comes with a generous salad), vegetable stews, purple shoots and Mediterranean salad. All are very tasty! The cinnamon tea is delicious and sweet with a slight kick.  We're Vegetarian/Vegan, but our guest had various meat entrees and said they were very flavorful as well.  If you're picky, I'm sure you could find some fault with this restaurant, but in the half dozen times we have been there, we never have.  Quality of the food has always been excellent and the price is fair for the generous portion sizes.  Highly recommend if you're looking for something different, like friendly service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"I am half Persian so I appreciate a good middle eastern meal and don't consider myself a snob about it. For example, I would rather go to a small family owned restaurant than the elegant fancy dining experience. Plus this place is close to my work so I've been meaning to try it.  This place has a number of good reviews but some inconsistency if you read closely which is what I experienced today. I was greeted by wait staff clearly in training which is fine (help wanted sign in window) I was the first customer and not in a hurry.  I had the dolmas and shirazi salad to start and shish kabob plate.  The food was not fresh. The bread was totally stale. Like rock hard untoasted stale. And I love my flat bread so a bummer. The dolmas were probably from a can but the best part of the meal. Well the rice was ok but not hot. The salad was drenched in dried herbs... A very strange shirazi salad and it was not fresh! Cucumbers and tomatoes are pretty easy to spot as leftovers.  Finally, the kabob was reheated as I could hear the microwave. Very disappointing. The plate of food was barely lukewarm. Hot rice from a pot and kabob just cooked is steaming hot even if it sits for a bit.  The dough (yogurt drink) was good.  Sorry persian garden, my friends will hear my thoughts and I won't be back. Too many other choices in the area.   Get back to basics.... FRESH FOOD. I spent forty bucks on leftovers. Embarrassed for you."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is great. We had the gyros, filet kabob, and chicken kabob.  All were excellent. The atmosphere is one of quaint authenticity. Go here."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed Persian Garden Cafe for their food, lovely ambience and gracious service.  While the decor and food remain good, our lunch experience Monday left much to be desired.  An extremely polite, almost obsequious, young man took our order. Although he appeared to be fluent in English, he seemed timid and unsure of himself, so to be sure he understood, we pointed to the menu items we selected, which he wrote down.  (It took a rather long time to even get our menus and water despite the fact they weren't busy, and he apologized for this.)  Then a young waitress came out also apologizing numerous times for the slow service.  When my companion's food arrived, I told her to go ahead and eat before it got cold.  Mine arrived much later and when it did arrive, it wasn't what I ordered. At this point, one of the servers should have come to the table to check to see if everything was alright, but no one did and we couldn't get their attention, so I had to get up and find her to tell her the order was wrong. Rather than send it back after the wait, I said I would accept it, but asked her to adjust the bill since I was served the meatless version instead of the more expensive meat one. Finally, toward the end of our meal, the female server asked if my companion wanted a refill on her iced tea in a \"to go\" cup.  I thought this was very odd and felt as though they wanted to rush us out of there, so I asked her if they were going to close, but she said they were not.  We never did see the male server after that, and you'd think that instead of empty apologies, an offer of free dessert would have been nice instead of a refill on tea in a \"to go\" cup. These very young people were personable, but completely clueless about working in a restaurant. The female said the male was in training, but both were incompetent.  It doesn't take more than common sense to check in with your customer after serving to make sure everything is satisfactory.  I may give them another chance, but probably in the evening, when, hopefully, a mature, experienced adult is present to manage. Had this been my first visit, I wouldn't be going back based on this experience."}
{"text":"Phoenix's best kept secret?    Why don't people talk about this place?  I took one star off because I can't afford to eat here.  The food is very high quality so I can't really blame them, but wish it was cheaper. Most dishes were $15-$25 if i remember correctly.  The food is fresh, authentic, and delicious.  It's not the kind of food that was prepared to make average people think they're eating good food because it is \"tasty.\"  This food is actually good.  Tons of fresh herbs, nothing was overly salty or sweet.  Lots of options for vegans, gluten-free, etc.  The herb soup was crazy good, never had anything like it.   The service was very friendly and non-intrusive.  The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing.  They were playing what seemed to be Persian classical music.  Was that a nay (reed flute) in the recording?  Well done!  I had some gift certificates to make it all possible.  I took my sweetie there on her birthday.  After getting completely stuffed on everything we could, we sadly had no room for a vegan cheesecake.  Knowing about the birthday, the chef insisted we have one on the house, and he came out to personally sing happy birthday with our server.    No one was there.  Why don't you go there now?"}
{"text":"Their Dough (yoghurt drink) is delicious. Their falafel sandwich and gyros are the best."}
{"text":"Had a fairly nice lunch today. Ordered the dolmas and falafel combination - it was a bit disappointing as the flavor was bland for both. Also, I was expecting the falafel to be served in croquette style, as that is how it is listed on the menu, but it came pilaf style. The side of rice was good, as was the mint tea (super good). Baklava for dessert was excellent. Service was attentive. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a very pleasant atmosphere. I would return but would choose something different from the menu."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've ever had!  This is one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix area. The food is authentic and very fresh. I heard the chef actually grows a lot of the ingredients in his own garden. The hummus is really good and actually tastes homemade, not like the store bought brands. The salads are filled with seasonal ingredients and each entree you can tell is made with quality products and so much care. There are a lot of vegetarian options on the menu if that's what you are looking for. The rice that comes with each dish is so good and perfectly cooked and we love the cugurt sauce! Everytime we have gone to the restuarant and taken a friend for the first time they rave about the food as well.  The prices of the entrees are a little high, but each dish easily feeds two people. You get plenty of food for the price."}
{"text":"I have been to the Persian Garden Cafe a couple of times, but my sister has been here a bunch. We live out of state, but have family in the area, so whenever we are in town we try to come here. I live in Los Angeles where we have no shortage of Persian Cuisine, but I have yet to find a restaurant this good.  Persian Garden specializes in vegetarian and vegan dishes, but there is plenty of meat and sea food options for the carnivores. In fact, the options are so good that I had a really hard time making up my mind this time around. I finally decided on the vegetable stew with eggplant, and it was amazing! So much food, and it came with a big plate of rice as well. I couldnt even finish it all, and it was soooo good!  The chef came out to greet my party and was very nice, and gave us a complimentary starter.  I can honestly say that whatever restaurant you decide to go to, it will not be as good as Persian Garden Cafe, and I have been to a lot of restaurants all over the valley. Do yourself a favor, tell a friend, and come down. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Authentic middle eastern food that will make you happy and full for hours. It was a bit pricie, knowing that other restaurants like this one have cheaper prices and more to offer. The menu had a wide selection for meat lovers and vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love this place. It is a bit pricey, but if I could eat here every day I would. I agree with some others that think they should brand themselves as \"healthy\" or \"vegan/vegetatrian\" fare, but I don't care what they call themselves as long as the food is outstanding. Furthermore, I enjoy the quiet atmosphere in the restaurant (I hate all the chatter of Chili's, for instance). It allows me to sit around with family or friends and actually enjoy our food with real conversations (instead of yelling to the other end of the table).   If you're into macrobiotic, vegan, vegetarian, healthy, or you just want to try something delicious, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here a few weeks back and I have been meaning to write a review. I visited upon a friends recommendation because I am vegan and love Mediterranean food.  This was my first time trying a Persian restaurant.  I am picky about the falafel I order anywhere, because I compare all falafel to my mother in law's. I ordered falafel(beautiful color on the inside), stuffed grape leaves, and a vegetarian stew.   Each dish had great rich flavors coming from quality ingredients. I was very impressed by the organic and vegan options that were available.  And even though I do not eat meat, I liked seeing that the meat they do serve is grass fed/organic/etc... For desert: the chocolate vegan cheesecake.  I was surprised by the hint of rose water flavor, and I loved it.   I can't wait to go again and try another desert! The service was personable and timely, and the naan kept coming. :) Another thing that I enjoyed was the table clothes and the classical music playing in the background. It is a great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Food very pricy and not that good! service was not good. the waiter seated us didnt even provide spoons/forks when the food came in.  and when we asked for something  he was getting it from another table just to keep talking to another customers that were dining also."}
{"text":"First time here and delicious lunch today! Ordered hummus to start and it was so fresh and light. Had the homemade honey and rose water lemonade. So refreshing! The falafel in Pita was some of the best I've eaten and again, everything was so fresh and well balanced! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at this place.  the owner is a passionate and enthuisiastic chef and it shows in his cooking.  We ordered 4 different dishes and an appetizer and all we great.    The Shrimp faranghe is grilled shrimp wrapped in grilled eggplant.  It was excellent.  Antoher ordered the Spinch Herb burger (vegitarian) and it cam on a bed of rice with a huge garden salad that was nicely seasoned with fresh herbs.  A third had the grilled Salmon that was also served with a salad and nicely spiced.  Last we have the kaboodie and it came with grilled vegetables.  Everything was fresh, well seasoned and scrumptious.    this is not a kebab and fries kind of place so expect fresh twists on your persian food.  We would defintley go back"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a few times and had a great meal each time. I was in a pinch and needing to feed about 30 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner mixed with vegetarians and meat eaters alike, so I thought I'd give the Persian Garden a call to see if they could help me out.   I called and spoke with someone who told me they'd have the owner call me back, which he did shortly after. A warm and charming man. He helped me to plan the menu, much of it I left in his capable hands.  Needless to say, the feast was ready when I arrived to pick it up, hot/cold as it should be. He even helped me load my car. The dinner was a great success. A great many compliments. There was enough food for 50 people. Can't say enough good things about this experience."}
{"text":"Persian Garden Cafe catered a recent party for us.  All of the food was delicious and flavorful.  It was also beautifully presented.  Our friends loved it.  I was especially impressed at how tender the chicken was; that is a quite a trick with white meat.  I also like eating lunch here.  I recommend the spud burger."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential yet it left me completely depressed. I'm a big fan of Persian food and when I found out that there was one not far from where I live, I jumped at the chance to go and took a friend with me for dinner.  We walked in and there was a lot of images and rugs from Iran adorning the place, but it was completely empty. The host/waiter was in a mood which already set things off on the wrong path (restaurants really need to realize how much service accounts for a customer's impression of the place). Once seated, we looked at the menu. I was confused. Stir-fry tofu? Caesar salad? What kind of Persian restaurant was this?!?  I didn't see any of the traditional Persian dishes anywhere on the menu. I asked the waiter (who wasn't Persian) where all the Persian dishes were, and asked if they made zereshk polo (saffron rice with barberries). He looked at me as if I stole his puppy. \"I don't know what that polo dish is, and whatever's on the menu is what you get.\"  At this point, I wanted to walk out, because I obviously wasn't going to get what I was expecting, but for some reason we stayed on. I flipped to the last page of the menu, where I thought the desserts would be, and lo and behold, that was where the kebab plates were listed. $18! $25! The prices were a little out of control for two skewers of meat, some Basmati rice, and a grilled tomato, but we went with it anyway.   Our dishes were ok. I got the chicken and my buddy got the koobideh (ground lamb) but they weren't anything remarkable, especially compared to Persian joints in L.A. that I've been to. This wasn't helped by the fact that were eating dinner in an stone silent empty restaurant with a sullen host standing there with his arms crossed.   I think Persian Garden would be better off rebranding itself as only a health food restaurant and leave the word \"Persian\" out of the name, because it's really misleading. The restaurant is apparently popular with vegetarians and vegans, which is all well and good but tofu isn't Persian food. I'll be taking my polo cravings elsewhere."}
{"text":"AH-MA-ZING The food was extraordinary!  So many vegetarian and vegan options!  The service was so attentive and the food was so delicious!  If you're ever in this part of town, do your stomach the biggest favor and stop by Perisan Garden!"}
{"text":"Closed. Looks like out of business. bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb       bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.     Bbbbbbbbbb"}
{"text":"Been there twice, and looking forward to another excellent meal.  Very flavorful food and pleasant atmosphere.  The lentil soup was very plain, but the eggplant Mirza was yummy. Desert was tasty, but a bit pricey...though that seems to be an unfortunate trend.  I guess that's a hint to cut down on sugar intake."}
{"text":"This was an excellent find! Very homy and relaxed. But the food was extremely good: the baba ganoush was so fresh and tasty and everything after that was really good/excellent!  quick tip: DEFINITELY keep room for dessert: the Baklava are awesome and so flavorful and the homemade ice cream is so creamy and delicious! We definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a very tasty place with great service. Please continue to support the restaurant as they rebuild from the drunk BMW driver who crashed through the door. I'll keep checking for reopening. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"This place had a good waiter but the food was very bland and the AC was also off. Overpriced for the quality or flavor you get."}
{"text":"Charming restaurant with yummy food.  We went for lunch and I had the falafel and dolmeh, and my hubby had the gyros platter.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the attention to detail was impeccable.  On my plate, there were two kinds of rice, along with the cucumber sauce, some sliced tomatoes and tiny sliced pickles.  Also, my dolmeh were topped with a tiny bit of caramelized onion, adding a charming touch.  My husband's dish had lots of gyro meat, pita pieces, some olives, fresh veggies and feta cubes.  We also brought home some baklava which was good.  The only criticism I have is that it was a little pricey, and I confess, I am used to getting some hummus and pita with my falafel.  It was totally enjoyable, though, and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I pass this place on my way to the office and stopped in to finally check it out.  Its decorated in a nice Persian stile with tapestry and wall art to sooth the mood. They have a small outdoor patio that its very nice this time of year and off the main road for some privacy.  I had some hummus and a gyro plate (as you all know I'm a sucker for) both very good, however the hummus was a bit bland for what I'm used to, but still made fresh.   The gyro was fantastic with Persian spice and came with vegetables and pita slices. I wish the pita slices were still in pocket form to make a sandwich out of, but I'm sure this can done if you ask ahead of time.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, keep my glass full, and made sure I had everything I needed. This place is perfect for vegetarians or those on special diets.  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Kebab lunch plates for $18! Get real! Even the $12 lamb gyro was not worth the price. The food is average in my opinion, the service slow & rude. I can't imagine why people would rave about this place. Have you people never eaten anywhere better?  Prices are not listed on their website menu, so make sure you ask before you order! A coworker of mine ordered 2 menu items totaling about $25 and was VERY disappointed with the quality of the food. Mine wasn't much better. Yeah, there's some nice Persian rugs hanging on the wall, but the place is tiny and has no ambiance.  UPDATE: I've eaten at this place a few times now and basically stick to the $5 lunch menu. For $5 the lamb gyro and the falofal are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great choice for finding something for everyone.  Our party had vegans, vegetarians and normal people (just kidding).  The spicy chicken had a great flavor without overpowering heat. Beautiful presentation and great flavor. It was fun to have an authentic meal including the coffee.   They missed on drink refills and a special request to avoid a food allergy, but that seems normal in ethic restaurants (not kidding)."}
{"text":"Great hummus and great falafel sandwiches the prices are great and the restaurant is friendly. Try the baklava it fresh and really good"}
{"text":"Eggplant merza is awesome, so is the spudburger"}
{"text":"My husband, toddler, and I went here on Mother's day recently and we were so happy we did! The food and service were impeccable. The restaurant was very clean and they were so nice and accommodating to my 18 month old.  Between all of us we got; Turkish coffee, spinach burger, gyro plate, mango ice cream, and baklava. Everything was delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited the Persian Cafe Garden for the first time today as it across the street from my school and I was in the mood for a healthy lunch. The server there was a pleasant young lady with refreshing demeanor, unfortunately I didn't get her name- but she was competent and able to accommodate my couple of requests.  The food was pretty good as well. I ordered the Americhix Pita, a chicken pita with spiced chicken, cooked bell peppers and tomatoes. It was served with a tasty cucumber yogurt sauce. The only suggestion I have, and it may be a preference more than anything, is vegetables were a little overcooked. I'm sure something they would address next time. The place is also a little smaller and personal, I believe the owner is the chef.. So just know, the ambiance is a little more relaxed and casual than formal. Otherwise, I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I never went to this place before 3 days ago as I am constantly side tracked by Hamburger Works next door and the outside of the place doesn't catch the eye or the tummy. Gave it a whirl this past Tuesday and have gone there for lunch everyday since. I am not at all satisfied with the amount of time it took to get my check literally, EACH time, but I will tell you that falafel is FAN-tastic. So good I have ordered it each day I have gone; it's called \"Falafal in a Pita\". In addition, the herb salad is so perfect. Great balance of fresh mint, parsley, and other various herbs, perhaps the remains of other entree preparations, tossed together with a bit of romaine and let me tell ya, no skimping on the feta on that bad boy. I'm not sure what the dressing is, but it reminds me of fresh lemon juice and garlic oil..bring a mint though; if you forget it, still eat!!"}
{"text":"The service is a little slow but the people are so nice and the food is so delicious it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Good menu to choose from.  Excellent service.  Went with a group of 6.  Everybody loved their food choices.  Will definately return."}
{"text":"Excellent place, laid back and relaxing atmosphere. I love the gyro. I would strongly recommend for anyone who wants authentic Persian food."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a hidden gem!! I have lived in the Willow historic district for over a year now and can't believe I haven't been to this place yet! The food was delicious and they have many vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free, and gluten-free options. And the Turkish coffee was amazing! I highly recommend this Persian restaurant."}
{"text":"I could eat the lentil soup for breakfast, lunch and dinner! They are now offering a meal plan....delivered!  God, help me."}
{"text":"We by chance found this place through Yelp and didn't know what to expect.  The food is absolutely amazing! The flavors are incredible. There are multiple vegetarian options and vegan deserts. The Persian chai tea definitely something to taste. Yummy! That's all I could say.  The chef is so sweet and the waitress was very friendly. We would definitely come again and tell our friends about it.  An absolute must if you come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Persian Garden Cafe is a diamond in the rough that if you didn't look you might miss it. The Signature sign markets the $4.99 Gyros.  The vegetarian offerings dominate the menu with lamb dishes and beef rounding it out.  The staff is attentive and the service may appear slow to those accustomed to fast food McDonald's quick. Unable to please everyone.   We didn't need to use the restroom so unable to comment on the operations.   If you have time for lunch or a take-out this will be the best quick location in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious wild salmon and the garlic pita is perfect. First visit to Phoenix and we chose this restaurant randomly. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Was planning to go to Burger Works next door but we arrived late and the place was jam packed for lunch rush.  Decided to walk across the lot to Persian Garden and I'm glad we did.  The place reminded me of may of the Mediterranean places around phoenix with the usual décor; nothing extravagant but comfortable. We looked over the menu and decided on the Mediterranean salad to split, the falafel pita and the gyro.  The kids split a grilled cheese.  Everything was very good.    The salad was huge, enough to split between 2-4 depending on party size.  I had the gyro which had tender meat and a really tasty taziki sauce, probably the best one I've eaten in phoenix.  My mother had the falafel and reported it was quite good as well.  Ended up eating the remainder of the grilled cheese the kids didn't eat and wow what a surprise.  Not the typical American cheese on white bread.  It had the flavor of parmesan on a good wheat bread with herbs, very atypical and a pleasant surprise.  If your in the area, and like Mediterranean dining, I suggest dropping in for lunch."}
{"text":"The worst Persian food I ever ate. Hummus was tasteless. Gyro meat was that pre-sliced frozen meat you can buy at CostCo.  I won't be back. I have nothing more to say than stay away.  ......................................................................."}
{"text":"Terribly bland, boring, overpriced food. I've had better Persian from a food truck. Don't waste your $$ here there are plenty of better middle eastern/Persian places around town which are also more reasonably priced. They charge for everything we even got charged for a tiny little ramekin of chutney (salsa) which is complimentary in most like establishments.. Service was friendly but slow. We ordered the lamb shank over Persian rice, falafel sandwich, and a small Mediterranean salad. Everything lacked flavor, salt, and personality. I am really am confused how this place got so many positive reviews"}
{"text":"I love eggplants and they have a couple yummy eggplant plates. The owner is sweet and friendly! I also love they have many vegan/ gluten-free options. Fresh ingredients good portion for the price."}
{"text":"I was really excited to find out that there was a vegetarian option across the street from my college.  However, I have had several bad experiences with the restaurant. I have attempted to eat here twice when they were closed. One time when I did catch them while they were open, they were out of the main ingredient in the dish I wanted to order, asparagus. So, on the fourth try, I was successful at ordering what I wanted and they were actually open. Unfortunately, the price soured my mouth. I think that at $20 dollar each for a veggie stir fry and purple shoots is absolutely insane. Picture it, two scoops of rice with various vegetables. $20 each? It wasn't even as if it was a LARGE serving. I'd skip Persian Garden and go to Mu Shu grill on the other corner; it's much less pricey."}
{"text":"I was so prepared to love this place because I had visited before and because it was featured on Check Please Arizona, the local PBS program.  I never had worse hummus in my life - bland, watery - like no other I have ever tasted.    The so-called naan bread was the low point of the meal - like a piece of dry cardboard.  Really awful.    My friend liked the salad.  I like the gyro strips.    In the future, we would probably go to one of the many other excellent middle-eastern places in town.    The service was fine - our waiter was a nice young man."}
{"text":"I know that hundreds of you wait everyday for a new review by me, checking yelp several times a day in hopes that I've been generous enough to share my whit and culinary expertise.   For all of you, my fans, I have some news that may rock your world.   I went vegan 5 months ago.   Margaret Cho does a stand up skit about people you should not F*** with. On the list are gay men, lesbians, vegans, and Bjork.   \"Do not f*** with vegans... Do not look vegans in the eye.. If you get in an argument with a vegan, say you're sorry and back away slowly. You don't mess with vegans because they're F******* hungry!\"  This is true.   I was hungry for 6 weeks until I realized the only two foods that satisfied my hunger are refried beans and hummus.   So.. why two stars for a restaurant that caters to vegans?  The prices.   I am not a cheapskate. I spend a ridiculous amount of money on food. I once spent $500 on a meal for three people - and didn't feel ripped off, because it was worth it.  I ordered a vegetarian plate. Humus tabouli, falafel & dolmeh served over white & brown rice. Falafel is topped with tahini. Humus & tabouli served with fresh veggies & homemade nan.   So... most places... a meal like this would be 8 dollars. Maybe 14 at a good restaurant. $20 for this... I expect the best on earth and a huge portion.  It wasn't.   The hummus was pure tahini - awful really. The baba was smoky and kind of gross The falafel I didn't think was that great. The dolmeh were good.   The portion size was a normal Styrofoam take away box with one piece of pita.  I will say that the rice was divine. Saffron - y and perfectly cooked.   The price was not equivalent to the quantity or quality.   I was mad. Baiz market sells a whole Styrofoam box full of exponentially better hummus for 5.99.  Vegans are a hard bunch to please, I realize, but charging this much for less than  perfect food will not win my business."}
{"text":"Back to Persian Garden for lunch.  I think I could eat the mirza farangee every day.  My kids had the falafel pita, and said it was the best falafel they'd ever had.  Really lovely  Persian baklava and Turkish coffee to end the meal.  Perfect!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great change of pace from the usual restaurants in the area.  I liked the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant, even if it seemed dated.  It felt like a traditional family restaurant, which was neat.  It wasn't very crowded, so it was nice and quiet, except for awkward conversation from our server.  I tried the chicken herb stew which was a bit pricey, so I would try a different dish upon my return.  The stew was tasty and had a unique flavor; it came with a ton of rice (I would rather have more stew than a huge pile of rice).  So, the portion size of the stew runs small, IMO.  My dinner date had the veggie burger and he was very pleased with his meal."}
{"text":"I love Persian food. Came here with three other friends about six weeks ago, just off a plane. We were a mixed group of eaters - a vegetarian and three meat eaters, all really hungry. Once we figured out what we wanted, a challenge as everything looked good, our appetizers arrived speedily, followed shortly by main courses. To cut to the chase, it was all really good. I appreciated the attention to healthy, organic-where-possible food, deliciously prepared in an authentic Persian manner. Such care in preparation, at reasonable prices, is rare these days.  Among us, we had delicious dolmas, a Generous plate of hummus with good bread, a potato-based towering mound that was a knockout and came with a big beautiful salad, tasty lamb kebab and beef kebab, and something that resembled a Persian stir-fry. Accompanied by the most yummy Adas Polo lying next to white basmati rice with a bit of saffron. I asked for some torshi, and wow, that was the best I have tasted - a blended house-made torshi that beautifully complemented the meal. A delicious and satisfying experience.   Unable to eat more but unwilling to forego a golden opportunity, after impassioned discussion with the owner, we ordered Persian homemade ice cream to go. I ate mine a few days later. It was one of the best I have eaten - with the usual rosewater and pistachios, but gloriously entwined.  Our surroundings were peaceful and lovely, and the owner, who served us most of the meal, managed a nice balance of respectful distance and engaging warmth. In short, a delightful meal, and I plan to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! Had the spud burger that was delicious! Brent provided excellent service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best food and an amazing vegan selection. The waiter is super friendly and the chef Mamoud is a master. Everything is SUPER fresh. This place is a little out of the way, but so worth it!! It's probably my favorite place to eat in Phoenix. The Spud burger is so good, I order it almost every time I go there. Everything is amazing though, I have never had a less than perfect meal and dining experience there."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The place was very clean and the prices very affordable. The spinach burger was so tasty and the Mediterranean plate was excellent. We also had the hummus with veggies and the falafel. Service was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Because no stars was not an option. Traveled from north phoenix because of the reviews....735 on friday night and they're locked up. No lights on. According to the information here, they should be open. Peace out!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very relaxing ambiance, friendly staff! I'd recommend the Chicken Stir Fry (it's big enough for 2) and the Gyro Platter was delicious!  There are lots of vegetarian, vegan, glutton free option. Just a little pricy, but really great food!"}
{"text":"My quest for good falafel continues.  Lured in by a huge banner for a $4.99 falafel lunch special I finally gave this place a try.  For 12:15pm on a Friday lt was oddly empty as we were just the third table. Once I took a look at the menu I saw why. Hummus app was $9 most items were $12+ not exactly ideal lunch prices in this economy.  I went with the lunch 4.99 falafel. It came with a small dollop of tabbouleh on the side with one small cube of feta. Inside the pita was tomatoes, lettuce , dill, tahnini, pickles and of course falafel.   The falafel it was was dry and hard, not the type of falfel I like. I did enjoy the tahnini and vegetable in the pita however.  The menu did have many vegan and vegatrain friendly options which was nice but at the prices listed and given low quality of falafel I am not too inclined to make my way back."}
{"text":"A small taste of authentic Persian food with loads of flavor lies nestled in a small pocket in downtown Phoenix. The hidden gem I discovered in passing over a year ago. The four times I have dined here I have always had a mouth rewarding experience. The food is amazing. The robust flavors in every bite cause cravings that make you clean your plate. Whether your a meat eater or a vegan there is something on the menu for you. I highly recommend the pita. The veggies are fresh with hints of mint. I was delighted to wash my food down with some rose water lemonade or chai tea.  The restaurant is decorated in symbolization on the culture. Plenty of seating and never busy. The service will be slow but it is relaxing. This is run by a husband and wife who deliver some of the best customer service. The price point is reasonable."}
{"text":"First time here today. Delicious! Shared the spanakopita special as an appetizer (yum) and had the Americhix in a Pita (close call between that and the grilled cheese and tofu) and some hot ginger tea (oh, my) Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. Have some leftover pita for later. Can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"There are many persian restaurants in phoenix and this one is by far the worst in my opinion...we ordered shish kabob, didnt know its beef, after realizing we didnt touch the entire plate and asked if they can replace it with chicken. He very politely told that he can. When we got the check we saw we were billed for both. Just asked if its a mistake, but the chef came and very rudely asked us if we know english.. he mentioned that we are from india or pakistan and we should know english etc etc..we told that we will give the price for both as originally it was our mistake only got confused as the waiter confirmed he can replace it with chicken!! but still an unknown person , a chef should have no right to tell us if we should learn english or not...the taste also was not so good..moreover our mood was spoiled..never coming back.."}
{"text":"It has been many moons since I ate at this place which used to be Green Leaf Cafe. I had such great memories of it, and this visit certainly did not live up to those memories.  The first problem was that, only after standing at the hostess podium for nearly 5 minutes (in an awkward silence because there were no customers or staff) did any staff to appear to seat us. Second, it took forever just for the appetizer to be done correctly (sans dairy) to come out. The food that we ordered was good, don't get me wrong, but it was not extraordinary middle eastern food. Maybe we just ordered simple stuff, and again there was nothing wrong with it-it was all great. But, since this is a bit off the beaten path for me I probably wouldn't return without the intention of ordering an astronomically priced entree.  Seriously, the prices here are steep.... every entree is $18-25. Appetizers about $7-12. Good food yes but, not sure if it justifies the cost. The ambiance is also very weird. It's extremely outdated with poor lighting and acoustics."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.Im talking about more than delicious Persian cuisine. Why, One, the owner is the Chef. Two, Conscious organic foods and fresh. Three share the love, the taste. four Clean restrooms, floors and kitchen. 5 An atmousfer that a Jewish mother inlaw named Ester would approve. There you have it 5 reasons means five stars. By the way I'd give it 6 but then id have to say a vegetarian would have meetups there if they would become aware. Share the love."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. So much flavor and so much is served. Although it can be pricey, it is worth every penny! If you're hungry, love rich flavor and kind service, you're in the right place."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was too slow for lunch. Dont go here if you only have an hour."}
{"text":"Ever since I first ate here, I've called it \"my favorite restaurant\".  But because I can't afford to eat out too often, I don't get to visit nearly as often as I'd like!  But every time I go, I'm impressed all over again.  Their mediterranean/middle eastern cuisine is SO flavorful, using a lot of fresh herbs and unique ingredients.  I always order a pot of chai tea - lovely!  Last time we went, we tried their saffron rosewater pistachio ice cream... pure heaven. It was so decadent, obviously homemade, I wish I could eat it every day.  Also, the waiter was excellent, super nice and helpful.  I've seen other reviewers say the decor and lighting is out of date, but I think it's delightful and relaxing.  I recommend the chicken stir fry and the cugurt sauce, and definitely don't skip dessert."}
{"text":"This is a must try place. Don't let the mediocre ambiance stop you from entering. The food is really really good and original. Merza Farngee is an eggplant dish that took my heart away. I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and tasty restaurant.  The service and atmosphere are wonderful, and the food was delicious.  I had the vegetable stew with chicken, and the flavors were so fantastic.  You don't have to worry if you eat Vegan, Vegetarian, or love your meat, you can find it all here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm actually a pretty big fan of PGC. I was first treated to Mahmoud's culinary talent way back in the day (late 90's), when he owned the Green Leaf Cafe up on 19th Ave (where Fattoush is today). His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.  The menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.  My biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).  Some things that shine as stars on the menu: * the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan * barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley * angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient *purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with sautéed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese *herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!  Most of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.  PGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!  The only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.  This is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles. It's not cheap, but they definitely make up for it in quality and large portions. Call ahead to check the schedule if you are interested in going on a night when they have belly dancing (usually the only time you need a reservation)."}
{"text":"Good mid-eastern food that is reasonably priced. I had a lamb gyro platter served with rice and vegetables. It was tasty. We got very nice service and they thanked us for coming. You could tell that this restaurant is owner run. The restaurant was very clean and cute. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place with such an authentic Persian menu and feel. Owner is beyond friendly and sweet.   Healthy food too that fits all diets (gf, vegetarian, meat eater)"}
{"text":"There are few times when vegan dishes at restaurants are plentiful, delicious, and hearty. Persian Garden Cafe has impressed us from start to finish. We ordered the Persian Chai tea and Humus to start, then had the Purpleshoots and Herb Stew - Vegan style.   The Purpleshoots - a grilled eggplant and asparagus dish, was so savory and had so much depth. For vegan food, it's a difficult thing to find vegetables cooked to the best of their flavor when dining out.   The herb stew was rich, hearty, and pleasantly tangy from the mix of herbs and lime. I ate the whole thing!   Both dishes came with full sides of brown rice pilaf and basmati rice. The pilaf was so flavorful, and dotted with raisins, slivered almonds, and lentils. You know when a restaurant takes care of its rice, it's gonna be good!   The service was wonderful, we CANNOT wait to come back. There were no leftovers - if that says anything!"}
{"text":"This little spot of heaven is a treasure. I went there for lunch yesterday for the first of MANY MORE times to come. My dining companion was raised on this type food and she was impressed with their culinary offering as well.  We shared the 'Purple Shoots' and one of their daily specials which happened to be a freshly roasted stuffed acorn squash. Both were excellent choices. Spiced and seasoned to perfection. The delightful hostess/waitress made the dining experience even more enjoyable.  This ultra clean café will be calling my name until I visit again. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"The food was 5/5 , but the service was really bad, and the food price comparison to any Persian Restaurant I've ever been was so expensive."}
{"text":"Persian Garden is an amazing gem of a restaurant in the Encanto/Phoenix College Neighborhood.  I work near here so I have regularly dined here for lunch and dinner for years and have never been disappointed.  When you come to dine here, it is like stepping into a traditional Persian home. They have both amazing service and a very welcoming quiet comfortable atmosphere, where you can actually hear your dinner companion and have a nice conversation.  The owner often circles the restaurant many times to ensure his guests are doing ok and enjoying their meal.  Now for the food - PG's cinnamon tea is absolutely amazing, I always wish I could take a gallon to go, just so good!  The food is fresh and adventurous, vegan and vegetarian dishes abound. However, they also satisfy any meat eater as well with lamb, shawarma and chicken. My personal favorite is the Purple Shoots or the Merza with either Gyro or Dolmeh, and any of the pitas are also a good selection. Love this restaurant! Their hours are very limited Lunch=M-F 11:00 to 3:00 and for Dinner = Th-Sat 5-9, they are Closed on Sundays. Sometimes during heat of the AZ summer their hours are even more limited, so check before you go if June-August.  An A+ and 5 Star restaurant in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is a small restaurant but the food is amazing and the portions are very generous. they offer a variety of vegan foods as well as meat dishes. Try some of their appetizers as well as their special dishes of the day. The service is always very good here. Their tea is very good as well."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to eat. So fresh and delicious.  Sometimes I'm not sure what to order so the chef will make a special plate:) Try the cinnamon tea too!"}
{"text":"Persian Garden Cafe is my favorite Mediterranean/Persian/Iranian restaurant in Phoenix, hands down.  When I attended Phoenix College it was perfect for me to run over for lunch.. I'm sad I can't make it in more often now that I live and go to school in Scottsdale. My absolute favorite dish is the spinach burger. Everything is home made and even though the full menu is not vegan, they have a huge vegetarian/vegan portion of the menu. Their hummus is the best hummus I have ever had. I have sent so many friends to your restaurant and they all give rave reviews as well.  i love you persian garden!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a group of coworkers. The food and service were great.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, various sandwiches and I had the chicken kabob which I would order again. Plenty of parking which is sometimes an issue in Phoenix.  The place is small but they have quite a few tables.  I'll save room and order the ice cream and lemonade next time as I've heard they are both excellent.  Give this place a try & support an Independent business, it's much better than any chain."}
{"text":"Gyro meet was well seasoned and pretty good. I like the bread that comes with it. The chicken on the other hand didn't taste like anything and parts of it wasn't cooked right . Also pretty expensive for the portion size you get. Good service though would consider trying this place again ."}
{"text":"Very cute place with great atmosphere and amazing food. The gyro meat is amazing and melts in your mouth. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   I came here on a whim, found this place on yelp and I am so glad I did. The restaurant is big, not crowded at all, and the staff is extremely friendly.  I decided to order a gyro and my partner in crime decided to order the purple shoots with chicken.  Let me just tell you that the portions are pretty large and even so, we devoured the two entrees as if there was no tomorrow!  The gyro was flavorful and fresh and the purple shoots was so good - every bite had a punch of different flavors and you couldn't help but to keep eating.  I rarely stuff my face for lunch, but in this case, I did and I didn't feel so guilty either.  I also ordered the baklava - I am not a fan of baklava in general so I thought it was ok.  I will be back. I can't wait to try the other entrees off their menu."}
{"text":"I am not very familiar with authentic Persian food, but Persian or not this food is delicious.  I have only been there for lunch, so I can't really speak about the dinner, but I have gotten the Spinach Herb burger on several occasions.  I have never really eaten anything else like it.  It is perfectly seasoned and I love the unexpected crunch of the walnuts."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice in the last week for dinner...it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said (around $20 for dinner entrees), but for vegetarian and organic food, what exactly do folks expect?  You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)  Our first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!  For entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said \"we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it\"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!  Our second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.  Overall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening."}
{"text":"Have always loved this place. Great quality food and awesome chill environment. My favorite lunch place."}
{"text":"Persian Garden is a Phoenix staple - so much so that I forgot about how many vegan options they offer! I've been back for lunch twice in the past few weeks. The cost difference between lunch and dinner is significant, so try to go for a weekday lunch if you are on a budget.  A few weeks ago I had the tofu pita, which was delicious, but very messy and huge! The bread fell apart instantly from the moisture. I took half home and reconstructed it - it was great! This week I had the \"Basic one\" - lentil soup, rice and salad. Again, more than I could eat, but flavorful. I love both types of rice so much, and the soup was rich and tasty. I expected it to be lighter (more like a dal) but it was very savory. It was a perfect lunch!  I split a small humus with my husband this time. It was surprisingly both bland and garlicky. And the pita/nan was a little to dry for my tastes. It was good with the humus though. I probably wouldn't get it again. My husband got the falafel pita. He liked how many veggies were on it.  My only service complaints: they don't mark the vegan items on the lunch menu (but they are labeled on the online menu), and the server (singular) was crazy busy both times. This week the owner helped her frequently. But, they are so friendly and working very hard that it is easy to be patient with them."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but the service is always slow, and the Ladies Room needs repair. That keeps it from being worth the steep prices. It's a good place for lunch as it is less costly then.   I recommend spanikopita, purple shoots, spicy chicken salad, fresh juice and fragrant tea. Needs work but still my favorite place for the most flavorful, healthy and organic meal in a cute setting."}
{"text":"It is hard to find good Arabic food in this area, but Persian Garden Cafe is doing a great job.  When I entered, I was treated with excellent service.  They pointed me in the right direction as far as what to order, being that their menu looked very American.  It was hard to find the dishes that I love because most of them were given American names.    When I left with my take-out, I could not wait to dig in! I even had a few bites in the parking lot.  Their tabbouleh was top-notch and was served with lettuce leaves.  The lettuce leaves are not garnish- you scoop a bunch up with your leaf and eat it that way.  It is a cool, crunchy food that is wonderful on a hot day.  I also ordered a falafel pita, which was spot-on and delicious!"}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and accommodating!!! Healthy organic Persian food!!! Yum! And vegan options!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of plant-based (vegan) options. Great presentation and flavors. Pricey, but large portions. They also have vegan desserts, like pumpkin pie! A great date spot if you want to go somewhere unique. And you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Dear Persian Garden Cafe,  I was so excited when I discovered your flier on my front doorstep that I immediately emailed a friend in the area to see when we could schedule a time to visit. I also couldn't wait that long, and ended up visiting you two days later, craving good Persian food that is so hard to find here. I researched the menu online, but wanted to make my to go order in person to get a good feel for the atmosphere. This is about where the good stuff ends. Be prepared as I now tell you about the sadness I experienced after I walked in the door.  When I arrived, and wanted to double check my order on a to go menu, I was directed to one on a table that had 1/3 of the items on the menu you list on your site. I then inquired as to other items I had heard of but weren't on this menu. The staff member was surprised and reluctantly handed me a real menu to which I found the items I wished to order.   So what did I order?  A spinach/cucumber dip with naan. The dip was fairly delicious but I didn't get to enjoy much of it due to the naan being hard, almost to the point of being stale. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Does it not travel well?   The spicy chicken dish with vegetables and Persian rice with spices and raisins was just meh. Nothing like the dish I was expecting. The rice was the part I was anticipating most, and the part the gave me the most disappointment.   The best part of the entire menu was the lemonade I tried which I think was spiced with a bit of ginger. It was delicious. Sadly this was forgotten about with the bad ordering experience, sub-par food experience and the over the top bill for it all.  I may try one more time, this time dining in... but even that scares me a little."}
{"text":"Except for the guy yammering about Foursquare at the next table, this place was awesome! Really good veggie options and delicious tabouli in a cool neighborhood."}
{"text":"Staff is SO welcoming and friendly!!! The eggplant is so good that I am craving it for days after. The rose water lemonade is delicious. Literally cannot go wrong with any dish here."}
{"text":"The Americhix chicken pita was good, nothing special though. They are getting three stars for being slow to bring out our food. We waited about 30 minutes for our food on a not-so-busy Wednesday lunch. Also they charge 0.75 cents for water.. So Meh.. Its alright."}
{"text":"I have eaten here maybe 6 or 7 times and have samples many different items and NEVER have been disappointed. This place is amazing and the owner is kind and really makes it an experience. I would highly suggest the Deezie? I dont know if thats how its spelled but its a lamb stew and words cant describe how good it is."}
{"text":"My wife and I ended up at the Persian Garden Cafe after our first choice closed early unbeknownst to us. So we looked out our next best option and we figured, \"What the heck. Let's give this place a try.\" First and foremost, the owner/ host/ chef was extremely friendly.  He greeted us with smiles and the warmest welcome for a restauranteur we've had in a long time. We love middle eastern food, but this was a little different from our standard, so he helped us understand what's on the menu and gave us a clear understanding of the specials. We ended up ordering a mixed appetizer combo plate and a special that was a lamb stew. The presentation was very nice, and again the owner/  host/ chef actually served the stew from a really old cool looking metal pot deal. It was quite elaborate and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The dinner prices were a bit high, but we certainly got tomorrow's lunch out of the meal. It appears that lunch may be quite a bit less expensive. The food was very good, and I highly recommend giving the Persian Garden Cafe a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Amazing! Perfect! Definitely coming back and adding this to my list of favorite places! The Ceaser salad was so unique and amazing. Homemade Ceaser dressing. Hummus had so much delicious garlic, pita bread was outstanding. Loved the homemade baklavah. Mint tea was so good."}
{"text":"Far from my normal cuisine we went for lunch. Service was ok, Not amazing. Food was good. Flavors where interesting and overall it was a good meal. It won't be a regular stop on my places to eat but once in a while it will make for a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Good food, a bit pricy and service is a little slow.  Still a great option if you want Persian food"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to meet friends for lunch ! Attentive service ! Tasty, flavorful food ! I don't know what can be done to make it better.... I only wish I could be a more frequent customer..."}
{"text":"With the short business hours and high prices charged for entrees, I'm not sure how this place has stayed in business so long.  Maybe it's because there are a mix of things on the menu - both mediterranean and not so mediterranean.  There are daily specials and you can get: - fresh extracted carrot juice - hummus and baba ghanouj - tofu - soups and salads - salmon - shrimp - chicken - gyros and kabobs  My fave is the Merza and Kookoo which is spinach herb patty alongside stuffed grilled eggplant.  It's a little oily but not overly spiced so what you taste is actually the food.  This platter will make you $20 lighter so given that, the Garden Cafe is probably not a restaurant that I'll eat at all the time."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in 1 week and ordered the same dish twice. Spudburger with spices and herbs over basmati & yellow rice and a side salad. Everything is fresh and bursting with flavor. My husband who loves meat found the food as delicious as I did.The menu consists of meat, but I would say the food is primarily vegetarian and vegan.  Other reviewers said this place is not Persian food. Honestly, they can call it whatever they want as long as they keep making the food scrumptious."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for over 5+ years and never bothered to try it; Except yesterday. I came to find out that I would have went on with my life by never going there and not missing much.  I came here for lunch with my co-workers so they could try Persian food. When we arrived, it was pretty dead. We were seated and handed the menus...as I was looking, I was expecting Cholo Kabab, Ghormeh Sabzi, Gheimeh, etc...instead I found TOFU, GRILLED CHEESE, and everything else that was not Iranian!  I am pretty certain tofu doesnt even exist in Iran. They did have doogh (Iranian yogurt drink), so that was good. I was so disappointed. We got the hummus and it was lacking flavor and was super runny. The bread, which the waitress called NAAN (it's called noon) but it wasn't naan or noon or pita bread..I don't know what it was. I do know it wasn't good. One of my coworkers go the chicken kabob plate, I got the shish kabob plate with half rice and half shirazi salad, and my other co worker got the BZ (or DZ) stew. My kabobs were chewy, my salad was overly sour and had too much dried mint, and the rice tasted old. My coworker didn't really like his stew either.   The service was extreeeeeemely slow. One of the girls brought the wrong food to our table...mind you, there was only 2 tables. And the prices are pretty up there for bad food. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week with friends and really was not impressed. Mostly everything is served with rice or some kind of bread.  I avoid these items due to carbs. One person ordered some plate with hummus and baba ganush which I sampled.  To tell the truth I did not find this flavorful but kind of bland.  Now I do not like hot spicy food but I do like food to have some sort of flavor. When I arrived I realized I had been there a few years back and didn't find anything at that time I really enjoyed. Maybe next time someone invites me I will remember that I tried it 2 times and not going to try the 3rd time."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch!!! 1st time here!! Got the chicken pita and the vegetable lunch kabab!! So yummy"}
{"text":"This is a very quaint restaurant with a real atmosphere. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The menu is broad and varied along authentic themes and the food is excellent and presented well. Truly a welcome change from the mundane humdrum of most eateries around Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! There is so much flavor and different textures in the food. I often order my usual, the Spinach Herb burger with lentil soup to go. It is perfect every time. I always get the cinnamon iced tea which is really good.  I've also had the Spanikopita and  the veggie stir fry. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"We were here a couple days ago for a quick lunch. Being close to Phoenix college, we thought it'd be a cheap and quick lunch but it was neither. The prices are a bit expensive for the small portion food they serve. Nonetheless, the food was good and fresh. The wait was a bit long too as they only have one person working."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood and passed by the Persian Garden for years, and finally stopped in for a Friday night dinner.  The menu has a lot of diverse offerings for vegans, vegetarians and meat-eaters making this a great place to bring a group or family with different food preferences.  They also offer great specials.  My husband ordered the lamb stew special which was beautifully presented and delicious.  I ordered an eggplant and chicken stew, also excellent.  Generous portions, and we had plenty left to take home.  We also started off with a baba ganoush appetizer which was delicious.  All meals start off with sliced apples and grapes which was very refreshing.  I ordered the cinnamon iced tea which I highly recommend.  We ended our meal with mango/ginger ice cream and baklava which were both outstanding. Some of the other reviews mentioned poor wait service but that was not at all our experience.  Wait staff was very attentive and the chef even greeted us when we arrived.  We will definitely be eating here often in the future, I'm just sorry it took so long for us to experience this gem!"}
{"text":"very delicious food.. full of flavor.  The lamb stew as superb with the dried lemon to add a nice twist of sweet and sour. The prices are a bit higher than other middle eastern food but this is a restaurant with a serene sitting area and nice background music.  We particularly enjoyed the fresh juice."}
{"text":"Great place to come for vegetarian food.  The menu is filled with tons of items for vegetarians, and the staff is friendly and fast.  The food I've tried has all been tasty, although I do find it to be a little over-priced.    The decor is fun...they really tried to create an ethnic experience to go along with the food.  Persian rugs and paintings decorate the walls, and the waiter told me that they might be hiring live entertainment soon too.  My favorites are: The something something dinner.  I am not sure what it's called, but you get a combo of eggplant, tomato, onions, feta and a whole lot more.  It's tasty.  The vegetarian sampler- yum.  It has falafel, hummus, tabouli and more.  The spinach herb burger.  It's different...but different is good.  They also have vegan pies for dessert and Persian baklava."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Large portions. Friendly service.  There is a ton of selection, so you'll likely need to come back to experience what Persian food has to offer! No salt at the table, so if you'll need salt, it will have to be a special request (food is seasoned well though, so you shouldn't need it).  The purple shoots is great as a side on many entrees; really unique, tasty, and the sweet and savory eggplant is cooked well.  The brown and white basmati rice has a lot of flavor, and I love the raisins and almonds mixed in.  Quality ingredients, healthy food, a lot of selection lends this place to be a top choice for authentic Persian and Mediterranean in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am always delighted by my meals at this restaurant. The owner is fabulous and the thoughtful way he welcomes each guest makes you feel like family. I love the noodle salad!"}
{"text":"Real food you can trust.  Lots of vegetarian and vegan choices.  I recommend the Mirza (eggplant and feta) with yummy saffron red rice with nuts and raisins:  delicious and substantial.  On a separate occasion, I tried the tasty spinach herb burger, and I hope that recipe is in the owner's cookbook!  Food has multiple flavors of herbs and spices.  Try the iced cinnamon tea!  The people giving poor reviews would probably rather eat fast food burgers.  The handmade food is high quality and reasonably priced.  The eastern music is very therapeutic.  I wish I lived nearby and could buy a meal ticket and eat there every day!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere. The seasonings are so unique, and this was our first time trying Persian food We ordered one plate for the two of us, and it was plenty of food. But we weren't sure if it would be, so we started with a cup of lentil soup, which was really good and unlike any other lentil soup we've ever had. Then we had Merza & Kuku with rice, which was delicious even though the dill was a bit strong at times. We didn't have room for dessert so we promised ourselves to come back soon for vegan pumpkin pie with coffee. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options as well as lots of meat options. Everyone is going to be able to find something on the menu."}
{"text":"Really good, surprised me with the stir fry, it was pretty amazing and the portions are large and filling. I'm definitely coming here more often and supporting one of the few local food joints in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very wonderful atmosphere, service, and food. Was Greenleaf Cafe at the other location and now since early 2001 or so, Persian Garden Cafe. Truly fresh ingredients and homemade flavors throughout your menu choices whether hummus, stews, naan bread, or gyros. Very elegant presentation of the lamb stew and at meals end, the delicious Turkish coffee. Portions are filling and prices are reasonable, especially on the lunch menu. Decorated with authentic Persian rugs and utensils. We highly recommend this restaurant for healthy vegan choices."}
{"text":"Met some friends last night for dinner. What a perfect little place to meet someone, or a date, even a special occasion. If I could I would give Persian Garden Cafe 10 stars. The owner greeted us. We talked food. He took our order as served us. Always a smile on his face,  some light discussion, and the food. Everything made from fresh ingredients. Even the bread is made in house. Everything is made vegetarian or vegan and many items are gluten free. You then can add chicken lamb. Shrimp, and salmon if you want to add some animal protein to your meal. We were there for 4 hours. We were the first to sit and the last to leave. Never at any time did the owner give us the feeling we were abusing our stay. We all left very happy and full. Please check this little gem on Thomas Road and 15th Ave."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time. Kinda pricey for a lunch, but I'll have a whole meal left over because the portions are huge! Food was delicious and they have a ton of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options! Also, the staff was very friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"This food was so good, I'm not even mad that Persia no longer exists. Persian Garden Cafe is enough for me.   First off, there's plenty of meat and seafood on the menu - but - everything can be made vegan. That's right. You can all come out of hiding now. You're safe here.  I shared the dolmeh and falafel plate with a friend and was satisfied, but still found room for dessert. Yeah, I've got my priorities straight. It came with four big, crisp, spiced falafel and three FRESH, steamed domlehs. (To anyone who has only had the displeasure of trying a canned dolmeh: now is your time. Feed.) That may appear to be enough to serve one person, but with the heaps of saffron rice, brown lentil-currant-other-tasty-things rice, tahini, tomatoes, and huge basket of flat bread it came with, it was more than enough for two.  For dessert, we ordered a slice of carrot cake and chocolate cheesecake. They're both vegan, along with the saffron rice pudding and pumpkin pie on the dessert menu... both of which I'll probably review in the near future. The carrot cake was huge, super sweet, heavily spiced, studded with raisins and walnuts and topped with a dollop of magical cream un-cheese frosting. The chocolate cheesecake was my favorite, probably because it was doused with dark chocolate chips, had a chewy, creamy center, and a crunchy, cookie crust. Last I checked, those are the only things I want from a dessert, ever.  Persian Garden Cafe ain't cheap, but the ambiance is warm and pleasant (not to mention, great for groups), the food is fresh, homemade and delicious, and you can get dairy free cheesecake that's better than regular cheesecake. If that doesn't make this place worth a shot, I don't know what does."}
{"text":"The best! Wish I could eat here every day. I feel great knowing everything is organic and individually prepAred with so much love and care! Worth the cost for sure!"}
{"text":"In the last two years I have become obsessed with their $4.99 healthier falafel, a seasonal stuffed acorn squash they have on special, and my fav of favorites, \"the basic one.\" It is a spectacular herb salad, lentil soup and two types of yummy rice. I get it at least once each week and their fresh brewed variety of teas hit the spot. The owner is often greeting guests and the servers hustle to get everyone served. Love how this place has evolved!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in town. Bar none. The owner is fabulous. The food is fantastic. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options.   I ordered the stuffed eggplant and dolmas plate the last time I ate here. AMAZING!   My dining partner had a Vegetable stew w eggplant and chicken. Wow!  The spices are well balanced and full flavored.   This is not some trendy place designed to kick out mass quantities of food. Be prepared to enjoy a slow home cooked meal.   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I had lunch with coworkers. I must say the restaurant was quaint and cozy. The food not only looks beautiful but it's reasonably priced too. I got a monster size gyro pita for $5.00! Service was slow but they seemed understaffed, the staff was very welcoming and courteous."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that this establishment pays much attention to reviews. I assume they don't need to. I'll start w the hummus. It's not runny, it's very very oily. Garlic is a bit much. They could definitely do better whether being Mediterranean, Persian, or Iranian. I'm Assyrian and know my foods. Hummus was crap. I ordered the chicken kabob, I was surprisingly pleased. The rice was on point and the chicken was moist. The \"vegetable salad\" was bland but not bad. I was hoping to find kefta being a Persian Mediterranean place but disappointed no such luck. The noon, was a wheat tortilla. The service was good, nice dude who was the only dude. All in all I expect more especially if owned by a true Persian/Iranian family. Shame on you for poor food. My grandmas was the best. I'll keep searching for a the best."}
