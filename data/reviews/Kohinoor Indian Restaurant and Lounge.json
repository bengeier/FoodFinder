{"text":"Awesome menu. Affordable. Really sweet family biz. Parking not perfect. Will be back anytime we visit Champaign for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. The food came pretty fast after we ordered. The chicken Tikka Masala was my favourite. 10/10! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food here was decent but the service was horrible.  We ordered samosa chaat (on urging from the waitress that we order an appetizer because the kitchen was a bit slow that night - more on that to follow), tandoori chicken (4 pc), chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer.  The samosa chaat was good and a nice little change from just samosas - though I could have just ordered the samasos and recreated it myself with the provided chutneys. Tandoori was good - no complaints there, the chicken tikka masala was just ok- the chicken was tough, but the sauce tasted good. The saag paneer was our favorite dish by far. Quantities were decent - we were a party of two and had plenty of tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala leftover. The naan portions were huge - if we'd realized how big they were we would have gotten two rice sides and one naan, even for the two of us we ended up with an entire piece left.  The food couldn't make up for the service though - after that night we likely won't be back. The restaurant seemed busy when we got there, so when the waitress mentioned that the kitchen was a little slow, we figured they were unexpectedly understaffed and slammed - no big deal, we weren't in a rush. Our appetizer (ordered on urging by the waitress) was slow but nothing ridiculous, but we waited probably another hour for our entrees to arrive. I quickly realized the restaurant seemed so busy because none of the tables were turning over and everyone was waiting for food - we asked our waitress and she said this was just an average friday night and it's always like this. A neighboring table left before their main dishes arrived - the waitress spent the rest of the evening complaining to us about them leaving without paying. Running out on the bill for their appetizers and drinks is rude, but they had kids with them and I totally understand their impatience with no food and no reassurance from the staff that it was coming any time soon.  Service may be better during the week or at lunch time, and I'd consider getting take out, but I would not recommend coming for dinner."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in my life. Waited 45 minutes at our table and not one person came up to us to say it would be a while. Our waitress even gave us dirty looks while passing us to give another table their food. just walked straight out, they can eat our order."}
{"text":"Unlike some of the other reviewers' experiences, ours was great.  I called to,see if there was a wait and to ask about a reservation.  I was told that there was no wait and we didn't need a reservation--but one was made anyway.  We had no problem with service at all, and my husband and I both really liked the food.  Our waiter was very determined to help us order things we would like.  We had a combo appetizer, which was okay (lots of fried dough coating), but the chutney sauces were good and gave it more flavor.  I had the lamb saag--spicy spinach sauce (spicy to the level I requested), and it was VERY good.  My husband's vegetarian entree--aloo go I--was also very tasty.  One amendment to what is on yelp:  they serve beer and wine but do not have a full bar."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Kohinoor for the first time, and I'm hooked!  I love Sitara but don't always like hiking over to Urbana, and Kohinoor has pretty much the same menu.  The staff was super friendly and always made sure our water glasses were full.  The restaurant is clean.  We've gotten used to waiting a while to get our food at Sitara, but I feel like we got everything pretty quickly at Kohinoor.  We may have just beaten the dinner rush though.  Anyway, we had the samosa and aloo tikki appetizers (both great, and I especially liked the orange sauce that came with it).  I had my usual shrimp curry and it was fantastic.  The curry sauce has just the right balance of sweet and savory spices.  My entree came with rice and I also ordered some cheese naan on the side.  The naan was so pillowy and cheesy.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have tasted in Illinois.    The Naan bread is excellent.  Friendly and fast service. I highly recommend you try this restaurant if you enjoy Indian cuisine. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I have ever had ... and I've had a lot. A true family run restaurant. Everyone is so kind that you can really feel the essence of Indian hospitality. 5 STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"If you appreciate good and prompt service, you should not eat here.  I struggled quite a bit on what to write with this review or where to start. I came with 4 other friends after reading other Yelp reviews and expecting a great experience. When we walked in, we were told there was a large wait time (about 30 minutes). My friend's name was written down on the waiting list. A table was not ready for about 45 minutes. I didn't think this was a big deal because restaurant staff cannot force other diners to finish their food quickly and free up tables.   While we were waiting for a table, one of my friends was given a menu. A member of the staff then seated us, but no one came to give us more menus. The table we were seated at was not set up for diners. We were not given utensils or napkins. We were simply given cups for water, and no one came to fill up water for a while.   We had to summon a member of the service staff just to put in our order for food. Even after the appetizer (Paneer Chili) was served, they did not notice that we did not have utensils. We had to ask. It took forever for our food to be served.  Finally, one of my friends had to get the attention of staff to get our food. After we were done with our food, getting the bill also required calling the staff again.   It seems that service here has a long way to go. We noticed some other customers were also dealing with terrible service.  Even though the food was decent, for which I have given two stars. It isn't really comparable to what you what get at Oak Tree Road or Devon Avenue. But it's perhaps the best in Champaign. I really want to support businesses like Kohinoor, but it seems like there were too many things that went wrong during our experience there."}
{"text":"This food is definitely not good for you... The chicken served seemed old and the biriyani we got also tasted  bad. I am not sure how this restaurant gets 4 stars. I remember leaving a similar review.. But, it is not listed anymore... Please avoid at all cost..."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've had in the Midwest. I had a curry with seasonal veggies that had sweat pouring down my neck before my third bite! They definitely don't tone down the spices to suit a Midwestern palate and I thank them for keeping it real."}
{"text":"Delicious new flavors, great service, wide variety of menu items, many vegetarian choices, reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere. Entrees served family style for easy sharing around the table. This was our first visit and we can't wait to eat there again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Waited in this restaurant for more than an hour before reminding the waiter about our order. The food was still not cooked. The food and the menu is exactly same as Sitara in Urbana. Don't waste your time here. #NotComingBack"}
{"text":"This is the saltiest food I have ever eaten in my life.  After leaving the restaurant I felt ill and was drinking water nonstop.   I have traveled all over the world and lived in India over a year.  This restaurant wins the saltiest food ever reward hands down."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would but I can't and I don't want to be unnecessarily harsh to a place that was not too bad. Service was normal; nothing outstanding yet nothing to complain about. Now to the food! When I read the reviews here I will be honest; my expectations were a bit high and I was let down enough to initially want to 3-star this place. Kohinoor is a very clean place, the food is clean. That being said, the food was quite bland, especially for an Indian restaurant which are usually known for strong and robust flavor. I have been to more than a few places in town that have been better. I went with 6 friends so I had the chance to test taste quite a few dishes. The tandoori chicken and the samosas were standout-good. The lamb and chicken biryani were extremely bland. The lamb Korma was meh and the chicken curry was pretty good."}
{"text":"delicious butter chicken + naan. Downside: can't find a free parking space nearby."}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum. Was driving through Champaign and came across this gem for lunch. Great find, food and decent prices. If I am ever in town again I will definitely stop in. Thank you"}
{"text":"OMG! I want to eat the naan bread from here everyday. I haven't even been here yet to dine in, but picked up naan only and ate it for lunch. SO GOOD, can't wait to come back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Admittedly I've never dined in here (though the seating area looks really nice), but it's one of my favorite places for take out. I usually get the chicken korma or chicken tikka, which are both just delicious! I have also gotten the vegetable pakora appetizer and they are addictive! I will say, whenever I've picked up some take-out there, the seating area has never looked super packed, so I'd assume there's not much of a wait, but I may be stopping by a bit early for dinner (around 5-5:30 pm). Either way, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food in the north part of downtown, right next to the post office. (Formerly Escobar). Often times we park on the street in front, but they have additional parking available. Especially after the fire at Sitara, this is our go to. The people are friendly and always keep our glasses full. We have always visited during lunch, and it can get busy... but never packed. Food is always quick.    We always get the non-vegetarian sampler. It seems to be the best bang for your buck, and you get so much variety. It is quite a bit of food, so bring your appetite. As for the appetizers, we have been flying blind when ordering... but no complaints there as well.   Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"First Indian food in my new town. I had the shrimp vindaloo. Perfectly spicy with lots of shrimp. I did carryout since it's just 3 blocks away. Looking forward to working my way through the menu."}
{"text":"This place was dope! We came after the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed, but I was probably happier than I would have been at the place we planned to go! The food was excellent. We started with complimentary poppadoms, then ordered a chili paneer appetizer. I ordered the paneer masala and it was delicious. Definitely recommend this place. Their wine/beer selection is also solid!"}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings. I have a hard time seeing myself coming back here after atrocious service we received last night even though the food was pretty good.  Pros:  -Serves alcohol --- they have wine and beer, reasonably priced for a restaurant.  -Food is good -- everyone at our table enjoyed their food; I had the Bhuna chicken chili masala and it was good, fairly mild. If I were to go next time, I would get the lamb vindaloo or something spicier. The garlic and cheese naans were great!! -Large selection -- they have a pretty big menu as compared to the other Indian restaurants in town, which is to see a variety. -Fairly priced - in comparison to other Indian restaurants and many other restaurants in town, the food is priced fairly -Great decor/ambience -- even though I know they kept  much of the layout from Escobar, it still is nice to see the Indian paintings and decorations that they have placed on the walls. -Close to downtown Champaign - nice addition to see an Indian restaurant near the downtown area to add to the variety of new restaurants opening up.  Cons: -Wait time for a large group -- coming here with 6 people on a Friday night is a huge mistake. They will keep telling you'll have a table in 10-15 minutes but we ended up waiting over 1 hour. They started taking our order while we waited by the door and said the food would be out when we got seated, which never happened, and we ended up waiting another 45 minutes to an 1 hour for food.  -Terrible, terrible service --- the waiters here are confused and have no communication with each other. After receiving our appetizers, a different server would come out with the same item, trying convince us that someone had ordered another order of the item. Additionally, they brought out food for everyone at our table but completely forgot one person's order, which led to another 15 - 20 minute wait.  -Servers are not responsive -- many times, someone at our table had to get up and find a server to fill up water cups or address an issue or even give is our check, when more than half our dining area had left -Issues with not receiving items order -- as I mentioned earlier, they forgot to make/ bring out someone's dish completely, which just added another 15- 20 minutes to the wait time. Also, someone had ordered masala tea, which never came out but no one informed us at all. After receiving our food, it was forgotten that it was ordered but when we went to pay, the host told us that they didn't even have any tea that night. -Overall time spent -- our group of 6 ended up spending  very close 3 hours of which we spent 2/3 time waiting either to get seated or food or chasing down someone to fix our order.  Overall, if you want to eat here, don't actually eat here, just order take out and it will be great."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out meat platter so cant say much about the service. Food was very bland except for the tandoori chicken which was average. Everything else was below average on the meat platter. Would probably NOT give this place a try again."}
{"text":"The food is hot, tasty, and fresh.  Sometimes the naan is overcooked and dry.  Overall consistently delicious.  I love the saag paneer with garlic stuffed naan"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautifully decorated, unlike many in central Illinois. I made a reservation and we had a table when we arrived. First of all, we had to flag down a waiter to order our dinner We ordered an appetizer which turned out to be papadoms covered in onions and tomatoes. Every other Indian restaurant I've been too has given papadoms to the table free of charge. (Like chips and salsa) at Mexican places. Felt I got screwed for that one. My friend and I order two different chicken entrees that looked identical when served. Mine tasted so so. The flavor was kind of flat. Most Indian places ask what heat level you prefer, our waiter did not. Our waiter also didn't ask about a second round of drinks. The restaurant was booked to capacity with not enough wait staff. Will try again, but cautiously."}
{"text":"This place is a top notch Indian restaurant with five stars service. The food was coming a bit slow but we got complimentary naan for that. The food was great overall. We ordered several lamb dishes. They were delicious."}
{"text":"I always get the Lamb Curry here and I love it! This is Indian Cuisine at its finest, I had some in Chicago that was highly rated and I liked this place better, in little old Chambana! The culture of how they serve is a little different, don't really have an example but just be prepared in case you are used to the same American styled service. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, attentive service, good options.  Definitely recommend the naan.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went for dinner a few weeks ago and liked the food and the server was surprisingly nice. However, I still believe Himalayan Chimney is slightly more flavorful but also more expensive."}
{"text":"Kohinoor is an outstanding non-buffet Indian restaurant located near downtown Champaign. It is a spacious restaurant with plenty of wait staff, so you never have to wait long for anything. The menu has a wide variety of options which fits well for my vegetarian leaning girlfriend and my lamb loving self.   Perhaps, the best part of any Indian restaurant in the naan. Here you are presented with so many possible naan options. I've been twice, and keep telling myself that I need to come back just to order a different type.   This has become my go-to Indian restaurant in the CU. If you're a fan of Indian food, I doubt you'll be disappointed, and if you're new to Indian food there are enough safe options with chicken or seafood that you can slowly figure out what you like without being overwhelmed by a buffet. Another plus, they do takeout.   I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be my go to Indian restaurant in town. I had been wanting to go here for a while and we finally got a chance to go last night. We were seated quickly since it was just the 2 of us and it was pretty busy. Every table was occupied.   They have lots of servers, so we were given water and menus promptly. There are so many dishes to choose from. My fiance got the garlic chicken masala with naan. I got the Kohinoor lamb aloo gosht with the basmati rice. We also ordered the paneer kulcha. The paneer kulcha was ok. I'm still trying to find my favorite flavor in the different breads they do. Our main dishes were good and not too spicy. Although, I love spicy food. The naan is huge! My fiance ate all of his garlic chicken and naan and he was so full. I couldn't even finish my rice, but I ate all the lamb aloo gosht and the paneer with it.   Everything was yummy and we left full for under $40 with the tip. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is phenomenal. In my opinion, the best Indian food in town. The staff here are so friendly and attentive to your wants.  Mango lassi - Honestly it's the best here because they serve it cold. At other Indian places around town, the drink is either lukewarm or warm, which is a little weird to me.  Lamb curry - I'm not one to like lamb, but I like it seasoned/flavored. One of my favorite menu items here.  Tandoori chicken - This dish comes in sizzling hot, emphasis on sizzling. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Yum.  If you get a curry, you get a choice of ordering rice or naan. I feel like they don't give you enough rice for the amount of curry, so I recommend getting the naan. If you feel like spending a little more on a different naan, I totally recommend the garlic naan."}
{"text":"With a vegetarian and two non in our group, we ordered a mix. we started with samosas (hot, spicy, and tasty). Then ee had a chicken mixed grill, baingan bartha (grilled/mashed eggplant, peas, and onions), and channa masala (chick peas in a tomato and onion and spice sauce). These were served with Naan and basmati rice. The dishes were tasty, and plentiful. we asked for the vegetarian dishes to be served vegan. The menu lists many of the vegetarian dishes as \"VEGAN\" but you need to just ask that they be prepared that way, as they normally are not. In all, there was plenty of food, for three people for around $40. Parking is a little spotty, but not bad, as it's north of downtown. Service was friendly, through not fast. I think this is because the food was made to order, rather than served up from pre-prepared batches in back. Likely the best Indian in town, and possibly the best new restaurant in town as well."}
{"text":"So happy to see a tasty Indian restaurant take over a space that was mostly uninhabited (sorry Escobar's). Great service here nice environment. Looks like we'll be able to eat outside although the tables were not set out the day we went.  My only request to this restaurant is to carry more Indian beer I'll definitely be back though. I might even develop cravings for their food"}
{"text":"I am Mexican. My name is Minerva :) wife to Sam. Here at Kohinoor I have been treated with the most courteous and fair treatment in this beautiful restaurant. There is absolutely 0 discrimination here, zero, nada!  The service is friendly!  Because I AM EQUALLY FRIENDLY!  If I don't want to sit in the table they are offering me, I courteously speak up, always relaxed and smile and I simply request a different table location. In fact my favorite table is just next to the kitchen by the window, if is taken, I request the next table as long as me and my husband are seated by the kitchen. I feel cozy listening to the sounds of the dishes, and bustle of the ding ding of cooking being done, especially on very busy times. I Iove the smell of the delicious food aromas eminating from the kitchen, after all is where the magic we came for is happening. And the welcome by owners and staff is of the utmost courtesy, kindness and I love to dine here! They make me and my husband feel like royals! :)  The food is fresh and delicious and the prices very good. Just come in smile and be ready to communicate your preference of everything. If there is something you dislike, talk normal to the owner, Ujjowl will fix anything gladly!"}
{"text":"Decent food at affordable price and service was friendly. Taste is similar to Sitara but I think this place has better lamb and Sitara has better chicken."}
{"text":"I've just moved from Dubai and after living there for ten years I can honestly say that I've eaten a great deal of Indian food from a variety of cuisines and regions of the country and I know what good Indian food is.   This restaurant is good Indian food. It's Northern cuisine, so be aware that it's going to be spicy!! That said, the food was done very well; we sampled several appetizers and they were all very well prepared.   We also tried four different entrées (there were four of us) and except for the chicken tikka, which was very dry and over cooked, these were also nicely done.   The service is prompt, and polite. The food comes promptly and the plates are put together attractively.   Price is good value.   I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, comfortable couch for pick up orders, the tikki masala and the naan are delicious"}
{"text":"Just tried this out today! It was super yum. Service was great they were so very nice. I think they mixed white rice with my basmati rice (haha) but otherwise looooved the food. Will be going back for more!! And bringing my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service, food and environment :) I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food! I got the tikka masala and garlic naan. Everyone else got a variety of different curries and we all were apart of the clean plate club. Service was very slow though, so don't come toooooo hungry. I will say that it's worth the wait and would definitely come here again on another visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Top quality service. Lovely ambience. Kohinoor is the place for Desi Indian/Pakistani food of the highest standards. Non-desi outnumber desi customers and the place is always busy. You have to request extra spice if you want the food to be as per true Indian/Pakistani spicy scale."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here is amazing. I love coming during the week to get their non vegetarian thali lunch special. If I come on the weekends I get the chicken chili appetizer and the chicken tiki masala. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great. G/f and vegan friendly.  The staff is very attentive and helpful. I had questions about dairy in a dish and got clear answers about their ingredients.  I had the Yellow Daal with rice and my husband tried the Vegetable Korma with garlic naan. Both were great, although I had no idea my dish was made with lemongrass - which I find totally gross and astringent. But there were only a few  actual pieces, so I just picked them out and the dish was fine with whatever amount of lemongrass cooked-in.  The garlic naan is excellent. Husband liked the Korma, but it's still no Delhi Palace... shout out, Flagstaff AZ!  We'll likely eat here often. It's pretty darn good, and it's in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you're wondering why this place is so similar to Sitara in terms of food taste, it's because one of the chefs from Sitara broke off and made this restaurant. I found this out talking to our waiter, who is actually the son of that chef and Kohinoor's owner.  Good food (except I wouldn't recommend getting the aloo paratha or butter chicken, get the chicken curry instead) and quick service. My mom really liked her lassi and my entire family liked the mixed sizzler platter. The navratan curry here is the exact same as the mix vegetable curry at Sitara."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! We love the vindaloo (though it could be a little spicier). Have dined in a few times and ordered take out once and lol experiences have been pleasant. Our first times dining in the service was a little slow, but it seems to have gotten better."}
{"text":"Excellent! Wonderful atmosphere and the food was delicious. I ordered the Tandoori chicken, spicy 4/5. Comes with naan and lentil soup."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Kohinoor at the suggestion of my son and his fiance.  So glad we went, it was the best Indian food we've ever had.  We had Chicken Tikka Masala, a potato dish (I forget the name), Biryani and naan bread.  Great bang for the buck.  I SO wanted to go 5 stars but I am very particular about the cleanliness of restaurants.  The place is nice, just not spotless.  Service was fine, nothing special although the manager came by and really made us feel welcome.  So I gave it 4 stars, I'd go 4 and a half if Yelp had that option.  Bring in a cleaning crew to meticulously clean the place one night a month and it would get 5 stars.  I would definitely go again and would highly recommend.

{"text":"Delicious!  We have eaten Indian food overseas and this is just as good, if not better! The quality of the meat and ingredients shows in how good the food tastes. The chicken was super tender. The kheer for dessert was the icing on the cake. Super friendly and efficient service. Ice tea was some of the best tasted. Go here!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, portions are large, prices are reasonable and great service! The naan and vindaloo are amazing!! This is our favorite place in Champaign for Indian food."}
{"text":"Great place. I always look for non chain places to eat when I travel and I was not disappointed. The service was great, the food was great, the price was great! It's off the beaten path, but obviously a favorite of locals.  Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Word on the street was that the owner of Sitara opened this restaurant, and as a big fan of Sitara, I was excited to go. I went with a group of 7 people, and we waited for our food for over an hour and 15 mins. None of the waiters apologized to us for the long wait and no one seemed to care. There was also a table next to us who were seated after us (with a group of 7 as well) that recieved their food before us. The waiter even apologized and gave them an appetizer on the house for waiting. My table did not. The waiters made some of our orders wrong, but quickly corrected them. The food was mediocre, as I was expecting a similar taste to Sitara. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sitara has held a special place in my heart... or maybe stomach since it opened. That's pretty much changed now that Kohinoor is here. The location is much more convenient for me and I love the decor and ambiance. They kept a lot of the original detail from Escobar's and it looks great with the new decor. I must say that service here is on point. They are WONDERFUL. So much so I felt the need to use caps. The staff are very warm and welcoming.   They also are great at offering recommendations. I have a hard time straying from those that I love and know won't let me down: Lamb Briyani, Lamb Curry, Lamb Vindaloo... okay anything lamb. The Lamb Korma is my new favorite. The mango lassi here is ahhhh-mazing. I don't know that I've ever had one that I didn't like, but I really enjoy this one. There are small chunks of mango and it's the perfect accompaniment for a spicy dish.  If you like your food to fight back, they do a 1-5 scale and I definitely recommend having them add a little heat to your dish if you live on the spicy side. If the thought of spicy food makes you sweat, don't worry. Most of their dishes are fairly mild even if it says that it is spicy. They also have some items that your less-than-adventurous friends can try if curry is too intimidating.   Kohinoor offers delivery and carryout which is a huge plus if you decide you really don't want that salad you brought from home for lunch. It happens. I've only been for lunch and the lunch prices are on the cheap. The serving sizes are very generous and definitely enough for two people or enough that you could have lunch the next day... but only if you have enough will power to stop eating and save it!  Don't forget the naan. All the naan."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how much I liked the food.  My first  time there far exceeded admittedly low expectations.  My last Indian food experience (Basmati) was terrible.  Chicken Korma was tasty, mildly spicy, and as tender as I could imagine.  Samosas, 3 chutneys and naan were great.  Service was leisurely, but not bad.  Our wait missed a couple clues, like presenting the check promptly, and collecting it the moment a credit card hit the folio.  We were there nearly two hours, and not in a hurry.  This might be a problem if you're fitting lunch into a lunch hour.   Decor is nice, friendly hostess,  There's a lot to like here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We tried their lamb masala and chicken tandoori. The tandoori came in a sizzling skillet and it was smoking. The chicken was extremely tender, I used a spoon and the meat separated from the bones. But my favorite was the masala. It was very aromatic, and full of flavor. It's a little bit spicy but not too much that you will need to chase it with water. The lamb was very tender, unlike most other restaurants where the lamb tasted very hard, like it was just boiled. The price is very cheap and reasonable. We have tried many Indian restaurants in the CU area and this was our favorite. The service was extremely nice, we had so many questions about some dishes and recommendations and they took their time to explain it for us. The staffs were all smiling and eager to assist us. The ambiance in the restaurant was very warming and friendly. They also have a bar side to the restaurant, although they didn't have their alcohol licenses to serve yet (the owners said they will get it in two days), the bar was extremely spacious. We will definitely come visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at an extremely reasonable price. Our very filling and flavorful dinner for three people was less than $40 including tip and non alcoholic beverages (chai masala teas and a mango lassi). Best naan ever I've had - it's perfectly fresh, fluffy, and each piece is about twice the size of typical naan. Indian food is one of the best options for vegetarians and Koohinoor's options are no exception. I really enjoyed #36, Baingan Bharta (mashed eggplant with onion, tomatoes, and green peas)."}
{"text":"It's the best Indian restaurant in town. All personal are friendly. Food is delicious. I can not eat spicy food. I always ask about mild or light cooking and it works. They have a huge variation of food in menu and I like to try something new every time. Additionally, it's nice location and beautiful interior with lovely music."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in town. The food is unbelievably authentic and delicious. The chicken curry and naan melts in my mouth. The shrimp vindaloo is juicy and explodes with flavor and spices. The staff is amazing. Welcoming and friendly every time. I particularly enjoyed my service with Brandy, who was very accommodating with the service being slow because of the dinner rush. She comp-ed us free Indian ice cream dessert which was quite tasty and worth trying. All in all, definitely go to this restaurant if you're a fan of Indian cuisine. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I went to Kohinoor on a busy Friday night. As you might expect, it took a few minutes longer to receive our food than it would if it wasn't busy. The staff was gracious and kind about the extra wait time, and the food came out delicious and cheap; these are the two main criteria for judging a restaurant. My friend and I split two appetizers and an entree, and we spent $8.50 each with tip included. Thus, it was really inexpensive and very tasty. The naan serving size was very generous. I look forward to returning.  This is my new favorite Indian joint in Urbana-Champaign.  P.S. They are also very good about re-filling water glasses."}
{"text":"I really had a great experience here. Ordered tandoori chicken, paneer saag, and lamb vindaloo. Everything was served as described and tasted great. Took off one star because the wait for someone to take our order was uncomfortably long even though they weren't that busy at all."}
{"text":"Ordered the chef's special mixed biryani.  The lamb and chicken was under cooked.  The biryani was bland and lacked salt.  Really tasteless.  The accompanying sauces were also bland.  They really need to step their game up."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much!! Just go! Best place in Champaign-Urbana area."}
{"text":"After a long day of driving, we decided to go to Kohinoor based on the great reviews. I'm so glad we did!  The food was excellent and the service friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Bhuna Chicken Chili Masala which features tender chunks of chicken and spicy peppers in a rich tomato, onion and garlic sauce.  My husband ordered the Chicken Korma and my son had the Malai Kofta and both were outstanding!  Kohinoor also has the best garlic naan we've ever had -- piping hot right out of the oven. We will definitely return the next time we're in Champaign!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful!   I had Butter Chicken that was to die for.  The cheese naan and garlic naan were soft, fresh, and flavorful.   The dining area was dim but not dark which made for a very pleasant dining experience. Also it made the Christmas tree  so pretty!    The rice was light and delicate,  and served in a separate bowl than the entree, which was also in its own bowl, making  it easy to share.  My husband had some interesting looking hot tea.   Staff was very polite and accommodating.   Prices are good, you can't go wrong with Kohinoor."}
{"text":"Kohinoor is a gem in C-U. I've never been disappointed...the food is quality, the menu is varied, but not overly so, and the restaurant has a pleasant ambience. Also, the prices are excellent! After a disappointing experience at Himalayan Chimney a few weeks ago, I am reminded of how lucky we are to have this fantastic place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The owners are so kind and welcoming and make sure that you're getting great service. I'd highly recommend the paneer pakora to start with. Drizzle some of that green sauce they give you on it... yum! Our waiter and the owner stopped by multiple times to make sure we were doing okay. Great! I had the muttar mushroom paneer without the mushrooms... A+. I am absolutely obsessed with Indian food and this place had some of the best Indian foods ever!   I would also recommend the garlic naan. Superb. You will need something to soak up all that extra sauce and yumminess."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! Service was quick and courteous! We ordered the mix tandoor grill, garlic naan and shrimp biriyani--- all fabulous! Will definitely be back, and ordering delivery for lunch at work!"}
{"text":"I got the mango lassi and Bhuna chicken and it is the best Indian food I have had here in champaign Urbana area. The service is good. If you're looking for a good Indian restaurant, hands down this is the one. My friend also got samosa and it looks really good. Overall a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Kohinoor has been getting good reviews. We were eager to try a new Indian restaurant, having been regulars at every previous one in town. We arrived at 4:30 for Sunday afternoon service, right when it begins.   Pre-service: The doors were open, but the lights were off and no one came out to greet us. After five minutes, a staff member walking through saw us and went to find someone in the kitchen. This person came out and told us to seat ourselves. We did. A few minutes later, a waiter came and asked us to move to another table. That waiter took our order, but returned some minutes later to say they were out of lamb (we had both ordered lamb dishes). We switched to chicken. I had ordered a beer (draft Samuel Adams lager), but that service was delayed for some time. Another customer (a teenage girl) asked if they had wifi, but their waiter said the wifi was out.   Appetizers: Finally, food began to come, with appetizers first. Those were good -- we ordered the chili chicken (which is served as is traditional with sauteed sliced onions and peppers with an eighth of lime to squeeze over the top) and the aloo tiki -- fried mashed potato patties. Both dishes were tasty -- mildly spiced but flavorful and well executed. I would order both of these dishes again. The chili chicken at Sitara is a little more to our preference because it has more acid, but this is a fine point -- I would gladly eat either version. To drink, we were also given room-temperature water, which is standard at Indian restaurants.   Three sauces were served at the table with the appetizers and remained for the rest of the meal. These were tamarind sauce, mint chutney, and a sour hot sauce. We liked all three.   Decor & Atmosphere: Plastic water glasses, china dishes, metal flatware. The decor is a variation of Escobar's but appropriate re-accessorized. Fairly plain, but clean and functional. We found the lighting somewhat dim (from the overhead pendant lamps) -- the staff re-adjusted the lighting levels several times during our meal. In nearby booths, there was also some blue strip lighting which seemed more appropriate for Kofusion and didn't \"go\" with the rest of the decor. Initially the music was coffeehouse, but later changed to Indian pop music.  Entrees: For our entrees, we ordered chicken vindaloo and chicken garlic marsala. We have had these dishes at many other restaurants, including versions at Sitara in Urbana. We thought that these were well made, but we like Sitara's versions better. At Kohinoor, the chicken was very tender, and the sauces had a good amount of flavor with the expected spice profile. However, the chicken vindaloo was not hot (in terms of spice) and did not have the tartness we've come to expect of a good vindaloo. The vegetable in the dish was broccoli florets. Similarly, the garlic marsala did not taste very garlicky and the marsala was overwhelmed with a tomato-based sweetness. The sauce to meat ratio was also a little off. These were wetter than usual renditions of these dishes. Even so, the amount of each serving was a reasonable value and the quality was very good. We ordered raita to accompany our entrees and it too was delicious (a smooth version, very loose, and sour as well as slightly sweet -- a good accompaniment that would be even better if the food were spicier).  Bread: I am a bread lover, and so as usual I ordered two types of flat bread to try. This time it was onion kulcha and naan with green chilis. We loved both. Each flatbread was big, warm, and flavorful. The vegetable flavors were pungent and delicious. We love the bread at Sitara as well, but here Kohinoor has a little edge. The restaurant space also has more seating than Sitara and isn't packed so close together, which is a plus.  Summation and Post-service: Kohinoor's grand opening is on Valentine's Day. For still being early in their service, the restaurant is doing a decent job. If I were able to advise them, I'd suggest they step up their game in the pre and post service. It also took us a very long time to get our check, pay, and get out the door once we were finished eating. We weren't sure why there was a delay, since we'd had good service during the meal once it had begun. I'd also advise them to spice up their dishes or at least to offer that option to diners who have an affinity for authentic Indian cuisine.   We're glad to have Kohinoor as another option for Indian dining in town. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service and below average food. Went with a friend last Saturday and we waited 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. They don't have assigned servers and the staff is often confused. Took another thirty minutes for the food to come out which is understandable since it was a busy night. But my curry was cold, watery and tasteless. The only saving grace was the naan. If you want authentic Indian food, go to Bombay grill. Yes, it's slightly more expensive, and a little crammed but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great Indian option! Have loved the numerous appetizers and entrees we have ordered. Perhaps in one dish the chicken was a little dry but i usually order paneer or veggie dishes anyways. The flavor profiles are fantastic, no complaints there. Service is pretty good too. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"THANK GOD FOR AN AUTHENTIC NON-BUFFET INDIAN PLACE. Was super surprised by the freshness and quality of their food, snuggled on a corner in Champaign. Definitely go for their non vegetable thali, which is this large metal platter filled with samples of their curry (yellow dal, shrimp curry, and chicken tikka masala), a rice pudding dessert (don't know the special name for this), a salty wafer, naan, basmati rice, and tandoori chicken(1 large chicken leg). Coupled with an extra piece of garlic naan, it was enough to feed me and my guy quite comfortably and made our bellies nice and full and warm on this cold cold day (10 degrees below freezing eep).   The curry is extremely rich, and they are very generous with their protein, which is both marinated to buttery-softness and heavenly paired with the garlic naan. Remember to ask for the garlic naan by the way, otherwise they'll give you the plain naan (which looks extremely different from the garlic naan). Oh, I also got the saag chicken, which was also extremely flavorful and hot- the perfect amount of saltiness for the spinach and a generous amount of chicken drenched in Indian spices, but I could barely eat any of it after me and the BF shared the thali. So much good food for such good value too O__o   The service was also 5-star, since this place is new and clearly family-run, the staff were all extremely friendly and the manager even came around and asked us how the food was. This place will definitely gain quick popularity in the coming weeks as the weather starts biting down on us. Wish I could eat like this everyday :D"}
{"text":"Wow! The food was amazing! I believe it is the best Indian Restaurant in Champaign/Urbana. I'm glad I don't have to go all the way to Chicago for authentic Indian food. The service was excellent too and the price for 5 people was reasonable. I definitely will be going again. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Kohinoor is easily my go-to place for Indian food in the area. It's located on the east side of Neil and Columbia, recently replacing what used to be Escobar's. The food choices are plentiful, ranging in flavor. Variety of options for those that don't like spicy food, but if you do then you're in luck. The naans are excellent (I tried the cheese, garlic, and Kohinoor special) but are exceeded by the chicken and lamb entrees (I've had the tikka masala, vindaloo, and bhuna gosht-my personal favorite).   The best asset however is the customer service, as the waiters spent time answering my questions and talking me through the options and brought us some more basmati rice for free during the meal without prompting.   The atmosphere is great for a big party too. Make sure to come hungry because the rice and naan will easily fill you up."}
{"text":"We went on May 12th before graduation. They had a special menu that had a wonderful selection. We got a bit of everything and it all tasted delicious. We got chicken tikka masala, lamb dopaza, paneer tikka masala, saag paneer and aloo gobi. We also got an assortment of naans and basmati rice. I would highly recommend this place for the food and the service. It was a busy weekend with graduation and Mother's Day but the staff did a great job accommodating all the people. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Samosa chaat is soooo delicious give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"We really love the food and it's a relaxed and stylish atmosphere. Great prices and very good staff. We recommend for a cozy night out and especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"We have went to all the Indian restaurants in CU and nothing really touches this place in terms of quality and flavor of food. I've been for lunch twice and dinner once. We've ordered Chicken Saag, Lamb Saag, Lamb Korma, Mixed Grill, and the Mutter Mushroom Paneer. We've also tried the regular naan, garlic naan and Jaipuri naan. Everything has been absolute perfection every time. There is one waitress who takes the orders (and I've seen that place so busy, she literally RUNS from kitchen to table) while the rest of the wait staff bring out the food, fill drinks, and clear tables. Waitress is knowledgeable about the food and has offered personable and extremely pleasant service each time. The prices here are also phenomenal. For dinner, we had ordered 3 entrees (one of which was the mixed grill), 2 orders of naan, a milk tea and a mango lassi and the bill came out to less then $45. We were floored it was so inexpensive for how much food we took home.   This place has it all. Flavor, great food, fantastic portions, incredible price and unbelievable service. Definitely head in here for a meal. You won't regret it. I truly hope this place stays in CU for years to come."}
{"text":"Food here is so good! I called to see if they could make things vegan and they said absolutely, just let them know. They said five of the appetizers were or could be made vegan and a hearty number of the entrees.  I ended up with samosas, chana masala, aloo ghobi, rice and roti. Ordered for pick up and it was ready when they said it would be. I'm just visiting, otherwise I'd go back here all the time. Food is better than the Indian places in my hometown."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, so as a student at uiuc I had to find a spot to satisfy my cravings. When I saw the positive reviews for Kohinoor, I decided to give it a try. I decided to go and pick up my order (since I'm too cheap to pay the extra $2 for delivery.) When I called to place my order (around 3:10), I was informed that the kitchen was closed -- but I could place an order that would be ready for pick up at 4:45.  They are closed on weekdays from 3:00 to 4:30. Though I wasn't expecting this, I still went ahead and placed the order. As I got my order to go I can not comment on the quality of the service, but I was greeted at the door relatively warmly.  I ordered chicken tikka masala, samosas, naan, and basmati rice. Everything was delicious! It was exactly what I wanted and perfectly satisfied my craving! The naan has a bit of a doughy consistency that is not my favorite, but it's easy to over look when the quality of the rest of the food was so sublime. I will definitely be back to this restaurant. I recommend it to anyone in the chambana area that looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"We happened in there on Valentine's day which also was their official Grand-Opening/Ribbon cutting day.    There was a smaller fixed menu which is totally an expected thing on a busy holiday for eating out.  We both got food off the non-vegetarian menu side and it was all very good.  The service was also very good even on a busy night.    We were lucky to get in with no reservation but we were there early so didn't wait long.  Definitely want to go back and try the full menu and bring some friends along"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was pleasantly surprised! Great deal at $26 to get two people STUFFED and have some leftovers. The vegetarian app sampler was delicious, although I wouldn't order it again as delivery because the fried items had time to get a bit soggy. Also tried the chicken vindaloo, which wasn't super spicy but had good flavor, and the Chana masala, which was quite saucy. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not disappointed at all, Lamb vindaloo was spectacular and naan was great to have after a long time of waiting. Asked to make it a bit spicier than regular 3 out of 5 is what I asked for and wow it was warm but amazing. Will definantly be back and may ask for 5-5 next time"}
{"text":"After reading all the raving reviews, I was finally able to try this place this past Saturday night. We arrived right around peak dinner time at 7pm and many people were waiting near the door. I assume because we were a party of two, we were asked if we would like to be seated at the bar. Of course we obliged, so we were seated right away.   We ordered samosas for an appetizer and lamb vindaloo and paneer tikka masala for entrees. The samosas came out very quickly and they came with 3 different chutneys. The samosas were hot and crispy.   Our entrees took awhile to come out, but a waitress came by and apologized for the wait and explained that this was the busiest it's been since they've opened. Considering the establishment is pretty new, we figured they were still working out the kinks. Once the food did make it out, it was delicious! I'm not an Indian food connoisseur, but this place definitely gets my seal of approval.   After we were done eating, the manager or owner (not exactly sure, but he was very gracious) came by and again apologized for the wait and thanked us for coming. Definitely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. We eat here every week and have never been disappointed. We recommend the Tandoori Chicken and the Yellow Dal. Seriously, the yellow dal is extraordinary."}
{"text":"So happy to see that Champaign got a fantastic Indian restaurant. This is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"We ordered daal makhani, chicken bhuna masala and naan. Chicken was ok, Daal Makhani was one of the worst we ever had in our life. It had channa daal in it. Who puts channa daal in Daal Makhani. Naan was awesome and one of the best we ever had. Search is still on for an authentic Indian restaurant...."}
{"text":"So delicious! I visit champaign on occasion and this is the best place I've ever eaten at while there, and def top tier Indian food overall. I got Dal Makhani and my wife got the Baingan Bharta. So delicious, speedy and friendly to-go service. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food, creamy and hearty, with a long list of vegetarian options at a great price.  We will be coming back for sure!  Cons: Lost order and made my wife wait for quite a while to pick up the order since they had to remake it, and in poor form, they didn't comp her anything for the trouble.  The naan was oddly doughy and lacking that tandoori oven flavor.  Finally, both entrees were delicious but seemed a little sweet to be authentic (i.e. I think they were a bit Americanized)."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying there's an Indian restaurant in my hometown of Miami that already has my heart, but this place made me doubt my loyalty. Everything on their appetizer and nan menu is top notch! We had vegetable pakoras (so good!), samosas, and cheesey chili nan. They were all amazing! Particularly, the samosas and the nan. These are the best samosas I've ever had and the assortment of sauces offered are so freaking good. The main dishes (chicken korma) were underwhelming, considering how amazing our appetizers were but they were still pretty good. Next time, I'll probably try a different protein or go vegetarian. My gripe with the chicken dishes was that the pieces of chicken were too small (but that's not that important). So if you are new to the CU area or are looking to try Indian food, you've found the right place."}
{"text":"This place is so good, i live in Champaign and i have been here eversince since its closer to my house. I dont want to make Kohinoor vs Sitara controversy here but hey! Sorry Sitara!"}
{"text":"Was so excited to try Kohinoor and I must say it did not disappoint! We got there a little before they opened for dinner and they let us in early when they saw us outside in the cold - very nice of them! The restaurant had a very nice and welcoming ambiance and lighting. The only thing I didn't like was the weird lights along the wall by the booths. Otherwise, it was a lovely interior.   I had the garlic naan and chicken tikki masala and both were delicious. The naan was baked to perfection and so fluffy and tasty! This was such a pleasant meal and the customer service was top notch! Can't wait to come back again will definitely try something spicier!"}
{"text":"This is a decent Indian restaurant in the old Escobar location. We were lucky enough to score street parking right out front for a weekend lunch. Service was prompt and polite.  I ordered the lamb saag, which was okay, with the garlic naan, which is just as excellent as advertised. My companion thought his shrimp were overcooked, and the coconut ice cream was so hard he had to cut it with a knife. However, three price was right ($30 with tip), and I would be willing to come back to try other menu items, especially since the lunch sampler isn't available on weekends."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend. I had the chicken curry, and it was just okay. The naan was spectacular. However, the service was not very good. My friend was brought the wrong drink, and then the waiter didn't come back for a long time. He was inattentive and not very friendly. I probably won't go back. I think Ambar India has better food and better service."}
{"text":"We had a great evening with awesome food and great service. We ordered a variety of dishes, meat and vegetarian, and everything was top notch. Be sure to have the mango lasse!"}
{"text":"Slow service, food was mediocre and the restaurant staff needs help with organization."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian restaurant in Urbana Champaign. If you are looking for competitive advantages, they are priced better, their service is better, and their food is wayyy better than any other place. They are a bit far from campus, but it's definitely worth it. First Indian food in the area that tasted like home. I got the vegetarian thali."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan! Its about $11 total, and they give about two portions (plus rice) so it's very reasonably priced.  I've never actually dined in here, but I live close by and regularly get take out. Takes about 10-15 minutes for my order to be ready."}
{"text":"This place is terrible for group reservations. If I could give half a star, I would. We had a party of 15 and made a reservation 2 weeks before. We arrive and wait an hour for a table. Then we get a table and wait another hour and a half for our food to come. Our order was not right. They miscounted naans and had no respect towards our guests. Instead of listening and apologizing for their poor customer service, they kept making excuses and even blamed us at one point. We complained to every other group reservation and each of them walked out. Terrible place, we will never do business here again."}
{"text":"The food was great. The staff was really friendly. They even tried to teach me how to properly pronounce the names of the food. The prices were fair.  They were on top of the refills. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating at Kohinoor a few times now and it's all been exceptional. The restaurant is so close to my office that sometimes I can smell the curry.   The service has always been great. The very first time we stopped to give it a try was the day after winter's first big snow. Town was slushy and crazy and we wanted something warm and comforting for lunch. So we parked and proceeded in, but noticed they were closing soon (they take a break between lunch and dinner rushes). We didn't want to be a pain for the staff so we got back in the car. As we were driving off a waitress ran us down and insisted we come inside for lunch. She said, \"If you're hungry, we'll feed you!\" I was so impressed. I've waited tables for years and I don't think I ever insisted someone stay past my shift (haha). It was a little awkward because we were the only table in there, but the food was great and they kept us happy.   The third time I went was a Friday night and they were absolutely packed. The kitchen was much slower than normal getting the food out, but the staff went table to table offering complimentary appetizers to help ease the waiting period. It was very generous and brilliant damage control. But the wait was well worth it because when the food got to our table it was delicious.   Yea the menu is almost identical to Sitara, but Kohinoor just feels different to me. I much prefer the dinning atmosphere and the close proximity to downtown. The staff at Sitara was always helpful, but Kohinoor workers seem more genuine - if that makes sense.   Favs: Saag Veggie korma Muttar paneer Naan"}
{"text":"I love their Kadai Paneer. If you have a cold, you will be cured. I swear."}
{"text":"Living in the area for a while and hands down this is the best Indian restaurant in the area!  Would be nice if they designed a student lunch menu!"}
{"text":"If I am craving for Indian food, I'll come to this place! This time, I tried something different. Lamb vindaloo was not spicy as I expected. Veggie comb platter was good. Semosa stood out among all the veggie appetizers. It just had the right flavor. It was crunchy outside and soft and flavorful inside. Tandoori chicken was alright. I also tried the famous Indian drink mango lassi. It was the bomb!!!!! It's like mango blended with yogurt. I would say it's more like a dessert than a drink. Anyway, it goes so well with other heavy dishes. It's a must in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Superb.  We asked the waiter to help us pick some dishes and he created a nice variety.  Our kids inhaled the food so spice level was just right.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite Indian place in the CU area. Everything is fresh, delicious and comes in a great variety. The atmosphere here is friendly and the decor is well done. Very importantly, the prices here are the best of many Indian places I have been too. This restaurant is inviting in every aspect, and is a great place for lunch and dinner.  I applaud then for their great vegetarian and okay vegan, selection.  Also, their \"sampler\" lunch specials are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The menu at Kohinoor is extensive and features the usual suspects at a North Indian restaurant; vegetarian, chicken, fish, lamb prepared in various ways. The vegetarian appetizer sampler was fried and tasty. Chicken korma and lamb saag were both flavorful and the meat was very tender. Rice was beyond fluffy. Best part of the place, most entrees are around $10, a bargain for the amount of food you are getting.   The menu did not indicate they sell liquor which was a bit of let down for dinner, and the service was speedy, but it wasn't clear that we had a server, it seemed like more of a team effort, which is a bit confusing.   The changes in the interior from Escobar's are minimal; decor is lacking but seating was comfortable. I will be back to Kohinoor, I just will be stopping elsewhere for a cocktail after dinner."}
{"text":"Such good food!  We took our two toddlers here for dinner and everything was so tasty.  The service was quick and good and they were accommodating of small children.  We especially enjoyed the bhindi masala and palak paneer.  I've also ordered carryout and been happy with that too."}
{"text":"I am brown. I am usually not satisfied with most indian restaurants, because i know how this stuff should taste. But Kohinoor was way above my expectations. This food is the real deal."}
{"text":"Super slow service and really bad food. Idk how other people think this is authentic."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian restaurant I've been to in CU--though Sitara is pretty close in downtown Urbana.   Went today for lunch, party of 3. The service as attentive immediately we felt warmly welcomes. It's pretty quiet in the restaurant which I attribute to 1) it's newness and  2) the holiday vacation. The interior is pretty but feels more Spanish than Indian restaurant--but I'm here to talk FOOD.   Appetizer: Samosa Chaat. Always a personal favorite of mine when it comes to Indian apps. This place doesn't disappoint. The flavors are full and satisfying. In top of that, the onions taste absolutely of onion heaven in all the sauce. Onion lovers, rejoice and scoop up all the bits of leftover onion when the samosa is gone. Non-onion lovers, be nice and let us eat them with gusto.  Drinks: Mango lassi. I love mango lassi, but frequently I find them too sweet with not enough yogurt flavor. Here, the mango lassi is a wonderful in between of sweetness and tart. The presentation is beautiful in a tall and wide glass and you can see the swirls of yogurt still from the fresh glass!   Entrees: chicken tikka masala, lamb biriyani, fish curry. Great prices. Great portions. Great flavors. What can I say?  Naan: garlic naan. Of course. It comes out to you in a basket and you are just hit with the most wonderous sight of garlicky, carby goodness. They don't skimp on that naan. Praise. Praise be.   I love coming home to CU and new amazing restaurants. I hope this one will be here to stay!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight with my mother and son. Food was phenomenal but I think getting there right as they opened was a mistake.  Our drinks were filled once and only once and getting the attention of our obviously very busy waitress was a challenge.  I actually felt guilty for asking for a to go box and apologized when she brought it.    Reading the other reviews I can see how this could be a delightful place however we did not have a delightful experience.    The food is why I'm giving 3 stars it was a 5 star meal with a 1 star waitress.    I plan to go back and hopefully update this review in a positive way."}
{"text":"Same decor as Escobar's, but with new pictures and Indian music. The good was fantastic. The spices were perfectly balanced, and the wait staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good size portions, reasonable prices, good ambience. This is one of my favorite restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Wonderful and comfortable environment!  My recommendation is garlic naan, it's super delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place! Reasonable prices, delicious Indian food and excellent staff. We recently used their bar area for a happy hour for a non-profit and the owner and staff could not have been more accommodating! I highly recommend if you want good Indian food without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and have always been very satisfied with their options. The Samosa Chaat is a great appetizer that I would highly recommend. Some of their great entrees include the Chicken Biriyani, the Chicken Vindaloo, and the Dhaal Makaani all which can be had with either Naan or White Rice. The restaurant also has an authentic design as seen even in the design of the bathrooms and the service is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Good service & bad food quality: I ordered a thali tray, the chicken drum stick came cold from one side?? and too dry to make u think it's cooked on the same day, so was the soup, cold. After notifying them I had it replaced. But only thinking whether ur eating something that was probably a reheated  leftover from the night before (and I bet with chicken u can always tell!) plus a cold soup made me give them one star/5, I made it two just for the sake of the good service that I got."}
{"text":"Loved the food, almost felt like I was in India again. The naan and the paneer was just too good!"}
{"text":"We come here a lot, and we're always amazed by the quality of the food and service. The staff are always very kind and friendly . We went there this Saturday to get their thali for lunch, but we realized they have dinner menus for lunch in weekends. I told our waitress about it, and she kindly said ghat there's no problem and they will make us thalis. We got a veggie and a non-veggie one and both were very good. Also, never miss the samosa chaat here. Best Thing Ever!"}
{"text":"Flavor of food was good as expected from reviews. They apparently don't  do lunch menu on weekends which is pretty standard so I am not complaining about that. The only thing that could use some work is attentiveness of service, would have ordered some more naan if anyone had ever come back to check on the table during the meal. Also the wait to have order taken and for the bill was long enough that it was pretty noticeable to me. Hopefully just an off day, I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great, and this has become my go-to local spot.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The staff is great. On my first visit, Kohinoor became my new favorite restaurant in town, and they've never disappointed.  There are a couple of improvements I'd love to see:  There's no lunch buffet. I realize that the buffet is really more of a tradition from Northern India, and most of the rest of the country doesn't do this - but many of my Midwest friends are new to Indian cuisine, and lunch buffets are excellent opportunities to let them sample a wide variety of new foods. So while Kohinoor is my favorite local restaurant, it's not the first place I bring friends.  Second, there are flashy lights in the back room that detract from, rather than add to, the atmosphere. It's hard to have a conversation when a purple light flashes across your eyes."}
{"text":"the butter chicken ginger masala was fantastic but the service was pretty meh. im fairly certain the server forgot about us a few times but the food was actually good enough for me not to mind! that said, the service made a one hour meal closer to two hours so...go if you have some time to spare? also it's super noisy but i dont care too much about that"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Indian in Champaign. They have a tough time keeping pace when it gets busy, but the food is always really good. If you love classic Tikki Masala and Naan, you'll like it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for impeccable Indian food with friendly staff (and nice covers of Boyce Avenue in the background), this is the place in central Illinois. Though there could be a wait sometimes, the prices and quality of food make up for that easily! A classic!"}
{"text":"Incredible curry. Chai tea to die for. Lovely atmosphere. Wonderful service. Oh my gosh I love love love this place.  I mourned when Escobar's closed but Kohinoor has made me even happier that they've taken over this space.   What a delightful, reasonably/priced place.   I heartily endorse a visit!"}
{"text":"I don't think I would ever be able to stop eating if I came here. Everything is SOOO good. And the service is great too! Everyone is super nice. I LOVE  Super spicy food and they gave me the right amount of heat! This was my second visit. The first time I had the Chicken Saag at it's spiciest and a vegetarian dish with garlic naan and rice. Today, we had the chile naan, rice, a lamb dish, and fish chili! Everything was delicious! I have been to other Indian food restaurants but they were never as good as this. Cant wait to come back and try more dishes. Everything is just so yummy!"}
{"text":"Uh, so THIS PLACE. Is. Fab. Just stopped by to pick up some food to go (so this review isn't about the whole restaurant experience) and the man at the front table was enthusiastic, kind, and helpful as I was picking things to try from the menu. It smelled nice, comfy couch at the front, food was cooked quickly...and then I came home to the best Indian food I've had in sooooommee time. Veggie appetizer sampler is delish, comes with great sauces, and is $5.95?! Insane. Naan was cooked perfectly, and the tikka masala had a niceee little spice. Can't wait to see this place do well!! Champaign and the owners deserve it!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian place in Chambana. I've went here on two occasions and got the chicken vindaloo, chicken garlic tikka masala, and samosas. The vindaloo has a deep herby flavor and is nice and creamy.  Besides chicken, the vindaloo also has potatoes and broccoli. I highly recommend getting the vindaloo.  The tikka masala is nice and tomatoey with some spice, but it isn't as developed as the vindaloo imo.  The samosas are pretty average. The staff at this location are very nice and constantly fill your water when it's less than half empty.  The naan is HUGE and tastes so good. I highly recommend going here for some actually good Indian food around campus."}
{"text":"Have eaten lunch here twice now, and thought it was wonderful. 7.99 for Chicken Briyani and I couldn't finish it both times. I happily gobbled it down later that night! Service was very fast both times for seating and receiving our meal. The second time we were in and out in a half hour and we were not eating fast. The Naan bread is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"A new restaurant in town, so you just KNOW I had to go try it...  I hate reviews that start like that.   But... A new restaurant in town, so you just KNOW I had to go try it. Monday night, needed food. Was originally at Radio Maria, having a cocktail, and was starting to get hungry. Not fully hungry... just starting. Eliza (radio bartender) was also hungry, so we decided we'd go to the new place. Why is it, that when I look at the name, my brain makes it say \"indoor restaurant\"?  So, we walked there. It's not far from the rest of downtown, so don't let that deter you, a whole 2 to 3 blocks.   Walked in, were immediately seated. I ate some sort of lamb thing, I'm not exactly sure what. It was good. I have no idea if it was good for being Indian food, I just know that I liked it. Instead of rice, I got the cheese naan (at least I think that's what I got). That stuff is awesome. Eliza got ... uh... something else, maybe a vegetarian dish... dunno. She also got the Samosa (I think) which was kind of like ... I dunno... like a crab Rangoon, except instead of being filled with crab Rangoon, it was filled with a mashed potato and pea stuff... and twice the size. Again, I don't know if it's good for being Indian food, but it's good food.   If you have no idea what you want, or what you would like, just look at the menu, and pick the one with things you know you like.   Try something new sometime, you are in too much of a rut.   Liquor license should be there next week, so don't let the lack of drinks deter you.   The wait staff was very friendly, and accommodating. Service was quick. They didn't directly laugh at my face for having no idea how to say anything, or having any idea what it was that I was going to eat.   Get the cheese bread!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com. Lol. I loved this place! It's a very nice restaurant with a cool interior and super friendly staff! We started with the veggie platter as an appetizer and garlic naan. The veggie platter had a samosas and some other fried goodies (pakora) there are enough to share among 4 people. The garlic naan is delicious and it comes with a choice of 3 chutneys. One had tamarind, there was an onion spicy one and another had mint? Delicious! I ordered a mango lassie and I'm glad I did! It was so smooth and perfectly sweet. Also I ordered some spicy bhuna chicken chili masala. Yum yum! I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, it arrived quickly. I had mushroom mutter paneer, asked for spicy. So delicious! Packed with mushrooms, peas and paneer, and was indeed very spicy, just to my liking. Had naan instead of rice, large portion and very good. Husband had lamb makhani. Again, delicious. Chunks of lamb were so tender, and sauce was mild, which he prefers. Did I mention that the portions were HUGE?? Have not visited the restaurant, but if delivery is this food, the in-house offerings must be even more fabulous. If you're a fan of good Indian food, you definitely want to visit Kohinoor, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but we ordered Chicken Saag and got Lamb Saag... which would have been fine if there was more than 2 pieces of meat in what was otherwise a bowl of creamy spinach. The prices may be better than comparable restaurants like Sitara (marginally better), but it's very clear why.   Honestly, the food was well-spiced and flavorful. But you just don't get what you pay for. Also, the naan/Indian breads aren't quite as good as your typical Indian restaurant.  Lastly, the service... just awful. I was informed that I didn't have any particular waiter, to just flag anyone because it's a collaborative effort... what? That makes no sense at all. And no waiters were making eye contact. We asked for a drink menu and never got it, had to ask a second person. We ordered two appetizers and one came 15 minutes before the other. It took us FOREVER just to get the bill...  The tables around me were also clearly frustrated with the terrible service. At one point, we were look at each other and smiling to each other because we didn't know what else to do... it was so miserable it was almost amusing.  Otherwise, again. The flavor of the gravy is good... but the meat is nonexistent... the service is terrible. The space is nice."}
{"text":"Best way to sum it up is that its a good place for a price that doesn't break the bank. The food is pretty hood especially the chana masala."}
{"text":"We were in a rush when we came, and amazingly the food came as quickly as at a fast food place.  The quality did not suffer in the slightest.  We had lamb makhani and chicken vindaloo as main dishes...both quite good.  They were of similar spice level, on the moderate side.  Vegetable pakoras were fantastic.  The naan was the best I've had in a long time.  Atmosphere was classy, with the modern music making us feel comfortable eating there underdressed."}
{"text":"Where do I begin..food was AMAZING and service was OUTSTANDING! Everything tastes so good and the staff was very nice and attentive! We live over an hour away but will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good portions, friendly staff.   I got the mixed grilled to get a bit of several kinds of chicken. The only feedback on this was that it was dry. I got the garlic naan which was heavenly and also a chili naan. The chilies were jalapeño and it tasted like they were raw so i would not recommend this. I did not eat in so not sure on the atmosphere but the staff I interacted with when i picked up the food were nice."}
{"text":"Great food and service. On par with Sitara downtown Urbana. If you enjoy spicy food this is the place for you. Also very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of townies were really sad to see Escobar go, but I have to say I love this place! I'm so glad there's a spot downtown for Indian food, but it is honestly now my favorite place to get Indian food in the whole area. The thali lunch special is amazing and offers a lot of variety for the price. Everything I have had though has been amazing. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant I've been to in Champaign-Urbana.  At least, better than the other two I've visited: Sitara and Bombay. I've not been to others. I like them all, but Kohinoor is certainly the best.  I had the fairly-spicy lamb dish and onion naan. The meat was tender and every part of the meal was extremely flavorful even down to the sauces on the table."}
{"text":"If you think Kohinoor is similar to Sitara, then you'd be exactly right... down to the menu, the taste, and the staff. I came here for the first time with that expectation.   The change in scenery-- from downtown Urbana to downtown Champaign-- gives this bigger location a more date-like vibe over Urbana's cozy, family space. Our service was fast, although the waiter emphasized the need for us to hurry as the kitchen was closing, then rushed us again to pay our checks, all the while reassuring us to take our time. I understand it was because they were nearing their break time, but there were tables after us still in the middle of their meal. Like father like son; like Sitara like Kohinoor."}
{"text":"This place is too good to let the world know about. I'm not crazy about crowds so I avoided praising it, but I see the cat's out of the bag now. This is the best Indian restaurant in the area and I've been eating Indian for decades. It's not buffet but quick enough anyway. If there's anything to complain about it's that close in parking is limited. My favorite dish is chicken korma with naan but they're quite skilled in a variety of dishes. Try one of their wonderful and inexpensive appetizers."}
