{"text":"Contemporary decor, great attentive service, reasonable prices and delicious Mediterranean food. We started the evening with the tasting platter. The hummus and baba were fantastic, as were the kibbee balls.. I didn't have a chance to try the other appetizers as I was sharing with a large party. I chose the Hommus Tabouli Wrap for my entree, which came with a tasty side salad. The wrap was fantastic and came with frites! Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entrees. We'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise - from the outside I was concerned as to what I was going to find in a strip mall setting - but this food, decor, service and ambiance are fantastic!  There are many drink/wine options, and the menu is diverse enough that anyone can find something that they would enjoy. 

My recommendation is to try the appetizer sampler.  You get a little bit of everything - but warning - it's large (so much food for only $12).  It could easily be split amongst 5 or 6.  

One of my favorite dishes is the Mujaddara.  So much flavor, and easily enough for lunch the next day. 

I hear they also have live Jazz?"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthful food; interesting menu; sleek and contemporary interior; and attentive and friendly service at this new, upscale (but reasonably priced) Lebanese restaurant near where Chagrin and Van Aken meet. We'll be returning soon."}
