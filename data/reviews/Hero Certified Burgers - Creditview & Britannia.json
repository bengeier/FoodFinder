{"text":"This was my first time trying hero burger, so my expectations were higher than usual. The staff working there were welcoming and friendly. The restaurant was very clean and well maintained, compared to restaurants like Licks. I ordered the angus burger as recommended by the cashier person. The patty was good quality, but a bit sparse compared to other higher-end chains I have tried. The bun was average at best and the condiments were fresh. The fries left me sorely dissappointed; they were fresh cut but overly oily. I don't recommend fries at this particular location.  All in all, I don't think I'll be returning to his location despite the friendly workers. Harveys will give you better quality and at a lower price."}
{"text":"The patties themselves are tasteless--it's all about the toppings! The burgers are pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Not bad. A step up from Harvey's and other burger joints.  Cheese on the cheeseburger wasn't melted and the burger itself was 7/10. Not bad for the price."}
{"text":"I thought I'd have a look with all the buzz and was slightly disappointed. Nothing wrong with it but it's just a typical burger place. 3 star instead of 4 though because they're more expensive while not actually tasting notably better than other food places.  Clean place to eat at and not very crowded."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings.  The patties are nicely seasoned and not bland like usual burger meat. Buns are decent and toppings are fresh with large variety.  So I see the *potential* in HERO burgers.   However, this being the only HERO I've ever been to and that too after much hype, I was disappointed by the lukewarm burger patties and unfriendly staff.  Add to that the $10+ price tag for combos and I don't see what the hype is all about.   Basically, if you are halal-conscious, then this will be the answer to your prayers but if you aren't then just go to Harvey's or A&W and enjoy better, cheaper fast food."}
{"text":"Walked in during dinner \"rush\" but no one was around. The two staff were lounging around the dinning area, one was on the phone. Both moved towards the kitchen and the one on the phone continued to chat. Stood at the counter to place an order and I just about left as the phone call continued. I turned to leave and the gentleman said \"I'm ready to take your order. Phone calls happen because we are a franchise\". Sorry? Phone calls in foreign languages take precedence over your only customer? Should have read the reviews before stopping by.   Takeout brought home, absolutely not worth it. Cheese unmelted, bun was cold, burger patty tasted from frozen. Will never go back.    Five Guys nearby on Burnhamthorpe/ Erin Mills has way better burgers."}
{"text":"There's really nothing special about the burgers. Normally I order the 4 oz Hero Burger but decided to try the 6 oz today and it tasted kind of dry."}
{"text":"Average sized portions. Way overpriced, be ready to pay over $10 for the cheapest burger and fries combo they have. If you want a poutine, be ready with $15 - seriously.   Service is bitter/dry. Kind of slow, but since it's a \"gourmet burger\" it's forgivable. Fries are nothing special, and the drink options are normal, so you're really there for the burger.  As for the burger itself, you're better off going to Harvey's. The buns are cheap yellow-bread hotdug-style buns (even though you're paying a fortune) and the meat is average."}
{"text":"This location should be shut down. I have nothing good to say about it. Ive been there twice and no one was there during dinner time. The second time the cashier took my money with gloves on and then proceeded to make make food with the same gloves. I just left my food on the table and went elsewhere. Maybe they resold it too? I wrote Hero Burger and never got a reply. This location wont last long I hope."}
{"text":"Hero Burgers has great food but the service at this location is one of the worst I have seen.   They refuse to hire more help and just have a husband and wife team with one helper every time I have been here. It takes forever to place an order and they always seem to get it wrong.    The last time I was there my burger had to be \"fixed\" 3 times. Other locations are much better."}
{"text":"Meh. If anyone wants to treat me I will tag along BUT I wouldn't go there again on my own dime. Slow slow slow service and pretty average burgers."}
{"text":"Marginally cheaper than five guys, and far better.  I had a 6 oz burger combo, with poutine (I wasn't ballsy enough to order the 8 oz burger). Overall it was actually pretty good, and I didn't feel like I was being robbed, as I did when I tried five guys.   The burger was pretty tasty. I was amazed by how fresh the condiments were. Never ever, have I had such fresh condiments at a fast food place. The patty itself was decent, nice to bite into but slightly bland. Bun was nice and fresh as well.  The poutine was excellent. They use real cheese curds which is a treat. I was too full to finish it, and that's okay I had already eaten the best part of it.  I gave it three stars because, while it is decent, it's nothing special. Slightly better than the rest (in the fast food industry), but still fast food nonetheless."}
{"text":"OK this a place is hit or miss. Sometimes I go here and the burgers are amazing other times I send it back because it taste horrible. I'm not sure why because I figured they have to serve the same meat but somehow they managed it.   The fries are good and poutine is good. The mushroom poutine is a bit much. The Zucchini bites are oily and soggy.  Its a fast food place like McDonald and Wendy's.  Take your chances."}
{"text":"All I have to say this is a GOOD burger!!! Lets get down to logistics:  The location: very well location shop near lot of amenities, you can find Nofrills, pharmaplus and much more.   The Shop: is quite decent size and there is plenty of seat. The place is kept clean as i have been to it couple of times.  The staff: is friendly, nice and quick to execute.  Washroom: are clean and usable  Parking: Plenty of parking as its in a plaza  Now the Food: I mostly have their 6oz burger as that hits the spot. The burger is juicy, not over cooked and the bun can hold the burger without breaking apart. The taste of the meat is nice and you don't want to over fill it with sauces so you can taste good meat! The fries are nice and thick and you wont feel that you are eating salt.  Now for my Muslim Brother and Sisters - On the site its give you a full breakdown on what is halal and vegetarian. So you can enjoy some nice burgers. http://www.heroburgers.com/pdf/Hero_Nutritional_Info.pdf  kapish! till next time."}
{"text":"Well, I am not sure what we have in other cities, but I believe my experience was quite good here.   I went for there new Soul Burger which was quite good. I told them that I wanted my burger spicy and they suggested me to add Jalepenos and Chilli Sauce in it.... And so I did, along with some Lettuce!   To he honest, since many of the people who have reviewed have gone to other outlets may know better, but my experience wasnt that bad, so I'm just gonna give them a 4."}
{"text":"For $15, I expect my burger and fries to taste like actual food, not some alien's imitation of what it might look like. This honestly made McDonalds feel like a gourmet fine-dining restaurant, and I HATE GOING TO MCDONALDS.  The establishment, as well as the chain, seems to be mismanaged and underwhelming at the best of times. Today, while not excessively terrible, was not the best of times.  To start, the cashier had no idea which drinks were still available, and upon asking the manager, I was told that the \"delivery isn't until later today\". While I can understand this being an issue at a location where there's a high foot traffic, resulting in certain fountain drink syrups running out, such was not the case at this location. When your fridge for bottled drink is 90% empty and the fountain drink dispenser is out of four different drinks, that to me screams of both the manager's inability to accurately anticipate the quantities of food required, as well as the inability to inform staff of the available products.  Moving on, my single order of burger and fries took over 12 minutes to prepare. It would be understandable if the patties were being grilled to order like many chains now do. No, these patties were clearly frozen, and had to be thawed before being served, because once again, these people are completely unprepared to serve customers. It's either that, or sheer idiocy. Given that the patties were not cooked to order, and the fries, which had the colour of twice fried chips but nothing of the crispiness or the texture, I CANNOT understand what exactly took so long.  Moving onto the fries, the limp, soggy, overcooked, and somehow still completely mushy pieces of over salted cardboard that I had the displeasure of putting in my mouth. Since I took my order to go, I can understand some sogginess, but these fires, while fryer hot to the touch, were either microwaved or put under an overheated warmer. They weren't just brown, they looked like they'd gone to hell, partied with Satan, and then enjoyed a nice summer vacation in Cuba.   I would suggest that these people take a crash source in fast food service STAT. This is not the type of place any one should be forced to eat at."}
{"text":"My first taste of a Hero burger was at a Rogers Cup game last year.  At the Rogers Cup, you can put as much hero sauce as you please.  It was delicious, although not the best.  Based on that initial experience, I decided to visit this Hero burger location and their burger is much better!  My go-to burger is the eight ounce burger with fries and extra hero sauce on the side.  It was so delicious and I was able to customize my burger with different sauces and toppings until I found my winning combination :).  The bread they use is special, not the normal bread you get in usual burger joints and the beef patty has a grilled taste.  So good. The fries are fresh and usually, I ignore the fries in a burger combo, but the Hero fries is not something to be ignored.  Overall, great burgers at this place.  The only problem is that they no longer have the single 8 ounce patty, they now have a double burger. Big no-no.  I enjoyed the overflow of meat on my burger and the thickness was just right.  Ever since they changed the single 8 ounce burger to two patties, I find myself not craving Hero burger anymore."}
{"text":"Cheaper than Five Guys and just as good. The burgers and fries are very greasy so its not a place you want to visit constantly. But in moderation, the burgers are very juicy and I enjoy that you can pick and choose what toppings you want.  The burgers are on the small side so it may leave you hungry if opt not to get fries. Nonetheless, its not a bad burger joint to check out. They have multiple locations around the city so your experience may be hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Partial Halal Menu Here.  Owners are Muslim. I tried the 6 oz Halal Angus burger with a side of poutine and a soda. The burger was pretty good, but I dont know if it's worth $8.00. The poutine was good. They also have halal chicken burgers which are pretty good as well. The hot dogs are not halal."}
{"text":"It's 2011 and I have set a few goals to accomplish. One of them being was to try a Hero Burger and might I say it was a great goal.  I enter the place and it's your average fast food joint. Very clean area as well as the restrooms. The server at the front was very helpful as he made a couple suggestions but ultimately told me flat out go for the hero burger, which made total sense, it was the reason I came to the place.  The service was very good, there were four people ahead of me and I got my food in about 5mins after I ordered. As well there was a huge line of about ten people and they got their orders pretty quick as well.  I ordered the 8oz Hero Burger and packed it with as much toppings as I possibly could. At first glance at the burger it looked so amazing. It was huge and was just dripping with juices. The first bite sold me! I couldn't believe I waited this long to try a hero burger. The flavour that is put into that burger is amazing, I understand now why people pay that much for a Hero burger.  Only downfall though is the fries! I would never ever get the combo from there again. The fries were soggy and greasy which was a huge turn off. But the burger definetly made up for it."}
{"text":"Poutine.  I wanted some. I had been wanting some for a long time.   Then I forgot. The entire time I was in the GTA, it didn't cross my mind.  And literally thirty minutes before I was supposed to head to the airport, I remembered.  So Tanya G. took me to the nearest passable poutine-purveyor before I had to go through the rigmarole known as... airport security/customs. We didn't really have time to do research so whatevs on that end.  HCB's poutine was okay. Maybe a little bland? I thought the gravy and fries both lacked a little somethin' somethin'... A certain \"Je ne sais quoi\" as it were (I am well aware of how pretentious that sounds). It was enjoyable enough, but nothing magical like the fond memories of poutines had as a young 'un living in Calgary; I miss the good 'ole days of wasting all of my twoonies after school, and eating like a fattie while never gaining weight. Being a grown up sucks...   In my humble opinion, I thought it was a little pricey for what was offered. I don't have anything to compare it to, so I don't know if the prices are standard for poutine throughout the area. But for a cup of semi-bland fries, gravy, and cheese curds, it was like... $6.   Customer service was personable and quick, so yay on that end. I'll have to try a burger the next time around, although the prices on the burgers seemed a little on the high end as well. Especially when considering that it's essentially fast food."}
{"text":"My burger was dry and the service was slow  . There are way better burger places out there for the money."}
{"text":"Burger flavour was good. However, The gluten free bun costs extra and always falls apart in your hands. It's impossible to eat without a knife and fork Hero needs to solve this problem.  Closed for renovation Aug 11 2017"}
{"text":"Ok, so first time a this chain and what a wonderful surprise to find out that this location is completely HALAL! Which is great for those of you that are looking for Halal fast food! The burgers are similar to those at Harveys and the price point for a combo is very comparable. The onion rings are awesome, and the serving size is pretty huge. I think the reason I enjoyed it is because they have caramelized onions HOLLA!!!!"}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with a hero burger ! But the location needs some love, ive visited other hero burgers location but this one didnt even have the cool coke drink dispenser .. So the choice of drink were limited :(! With high competition the looks of the place is important :)"}
{"text":"Dude. What in the world was that? I can get behind halal Angus IF it's seasoned. This wasent. I can get behind beef bacon if it's thin and crispy. This was leather. And I regret that my first time eating poutine was here cuz it sucked. Overall just a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Burgers tasted like a frozen beef patty. Fries were ok. Poutine with cheese curds and gravy were awesome. The 100% angus hotdogs were really good. Hero burgers are in need of a rescue!"}
{"text":"Not deserving of any stars=this specific location.  Does this go down to NEGATIVE 11?  THE ABSOLUTE WORST service I've ever received in my entire life, and I am a pretty understanding and broad-minded person.  This happened years ago, but I had the rudest old fart behind the counter serve me who was most likely the owner because he felt like he needed to be so smug and sarcastic as to mock and humiliate me in front of all my friends just because I didn't instantly understand how their ordering system worked.  Umm, I didn't know how it worked because it was my first and LAST time to ever step foot in this overpriced, second-rate to Harveys restaurant.  I have a Hero burger near where I live too and all I see is that disgusting man's face superimposed on the sign outside.  Writing this review has been extremely cathartic."}
{"text":"First time at this location. We normally go to Hero Burger in Liberty Village as we live in Toronto. We were hungry and in the neighborhood.  I have nothing but praise.   Pleasant service. Fresh food. Fresh ingredients. Fresh bun. 8 to 10 minutes of wait time.  Great atmosphere. Seems like a new location.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Eww! We love hero burger BUT this LOCATION was simply shameful. Nothing tasted right and the attitude of the staff there makes you leave with a bitter taste. Big disappointment"}
{"text":"I usually have Hero Burger near my office downtown and it's always amazing! Don't judge the franchise by this location. Their burgers don't seem to be up to par to the other locations and they are VERY tight ass with the paid toppings and even bitch about giving you more than two packs of ketchup after you just dropped $24 bucks on two combos!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. They were courteous. I tried their specialty burger which was great. I enjoyed"}
