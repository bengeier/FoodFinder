{"text":"Went for the first time today. Atmosphere is really relaxed and comfortable which puts you at ease especially if you tend to be a little nervous when trying new things.

Got three of the special bubble tea floats which are only available once a month. Tried, Mango,Taro and Green tea. 

I will say that the bubble tea was not as creamy as I have had  at other places as it is made using ice. However, I found the tea to be very refreshing and not sickeningly sweet like some other establishments. 


Will be back for more Boba and to try the food."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday because of the great reviews. I definitely will not be returning. The taste of the food overall was just eh. The reason I'm giving it two stars is because I was almost given the wrong food, which okay the girl seemed kind of busy so it didn't bother me, but when I went home I realized I was overcharged! I ordered red curry with an order of spring rolls. That should have only been $13.50 and instead I paid $16. Then I realized I got 4 spring rolls instead of two. So I'm confused as to why that happened. The flavor of the curry was good, but the texture was so watery. I've definitely have had better in the past. The spring rolls weren't that great either. The sauce that came with it was good. The girl at the counter seemed nice but it just wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"Service was super quick and the food was amazing, also the price wasn't too bad. Definitely recommend for takeout."}
{"text":"I went here one Monday evening with a girlfriend of mine, we both are enthusiasts of Thai food, and both  have husbands who can't stand it. So we left them home! We shared egg rolls and spring rolls, both of which were delicious. She had the pad thai, and I had a spicy noodle dish that they claim on the menu is great for hangovers. Sorry, I forget the name. While I wasn't hung over, I had had a headache since the very early morning hours on Monday and was almost going to cancel on my friend. Within 30 minutes of eating that dish, I felt fantastic!  Could have been a coincidence, but maybe it really is a healer! I was sick last week, and I craved that dish again in the hopes I would feel better, but alas, Lakewood is a bit of a haul for me when I'm under the weather. I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"It is okay.  We like the duck soup and egg rolls.  However we had better thai food before like Thai Spice in Westlake."}
{"text":"Thai street foods..this is the real taste of Thailand..everything is authentic that make you feel like eating Thai foods in Thailand!"}
{"text":"I've got take out three times and every time the food has been great. Today despite closing at 6, they took my order and prepared it when I called as they closed just a little after 6. As always the food was great. This is a great establishment as both the food and service had been great. Thanks you Thai Thai!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Super quaint little gem. The potstickers are to die for. We've been a couple of times now and have sampled the menu and haven't found anything we don't like!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. I ordered the Pad Thai. I am not an expert in Thai, Chinese, or Japanese food. I have noticed that pad thai has varied in recipe over the many places that I have tried it. Today's lunch was very enjoyable. I would not hesitate to order this dish again from Thai Thai. I look forward to trying other items from the menu. I noticed several dishes that specified basil and spicey. One of these will be my next meal there."}
{"text":"I've had Thai Thai several times since they opened and have never been disappointed. Their Pad Thai is always great and I'm a big fan of the Tom  Kha soup which is my go-to everytime I order. I also highly recommend the Kra Praow (Hot Basil) and the papaya salad. Aside from the excellent food, I always appreciate their friendliness and quick service too. A must visit for Thai on the west side!"}
{"text":"I had a busy day at work and skipped lunch so I was starving when I came to Thai Thai.

I ordered the Red Panang Curry with pork.  It may be due to the fact that I was starving but the curry tasted awesome.  

PROS:  Food tasted great.  Good attentive service.  Good restaurant decor.

CONS:  Bit overpriced.  $14.50 for panang curry is more than what I usually pay.  They charge for extra rice.

I can't stand places that charge extra for rice.  If you are at a asian restaurant, you should never have to pay for extra rice.  I'm all for restaurants charging you for extra rice if two people want to split one dish, but if a table orders one dish per person, you should get all the rice you want.  

This place charges $2 for extra bowl of rice and it's a very small bowl of rice.  I've been at other restaurants that  do the same and it's a rip.

I still gave this place 4 stars because of good food and good service."}
{"text":"Literally the best place in cle the guy who's always there is the best and the food is delicious there's nothing like it. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I have loved everything. This places bubble tea is the only bubble tea I like and I highly recommended there duck soup. If I could I would give this place 100,000,000 stars but I can't I would go there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place but my most memorable time here was with my cousin who decided she had to get plastered after hearing bad news.  So, being the caring family member I am, I opted for the same beverage she ordered--a Long Island Iced Tea.  In my previous experience, a LIIT is usually somewhat drinkable, however, Thai Thai must have only thought a Long Island is made by mixing whatever alcohol you have in whatever quantity of each you feel like.  HORRIBLE TASTING!  But man, was I hammered!!!

Anyways, the food is great, can't say much about the actual restaurant inside as I've always dined on the patio.  Contrary to a previous review, I have never been charged for extra rice, but maybe they just liked me? ;) Some of the appetizers are extremely pricey for what you get though, but the rest is pretty normal Scottsdale prices.

Bottom Line: Best Thai in Phoenix"}
{"text":"So glad we can finally get FRESH Pad Thai in Lakewood! Always super fast service and great value!!! 
Also get a bubble tea or sometimes they have specialty drinks on the weekends! 

Much !!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited after Christmas because we wanted something fresh to eat that wasn't too heavy and the other yelp reviews said \"we just had to try it\". The food here is awesome! I will take everyone's word for it that it is just like street food in Thailand since I have never been. 

The service was a tad bit strange and we felt that the guy doing the front of house service was also helping to prep food because he seemed to be very busy and not around too much. Low and behold though his family used to own one of my family and I's favorite restaurants down in Florida where my grandmother used to live!! No wonder I love the food so much!

I ordered the Kra Proaw after most of the reviews said I should but I was a tad bit worried when I saw the 3 peppers to say that it was spicy. Just a tip, it is more like medium spice than hot. My boyfriend ordered the Pad See Eiw. Both dishes were awesome but I liked mine better only because I like the spiciness added to the dish. The sauce that is in the Kra Proaw is so delicious that I made sure to combine my rice with it. They give you so much food and I left happy, full and not feeling bloated. 

Most people get take-out here and we realized it's because they only have 5 tables. If you haven't been you really do need to listen to yelpers on this one and GO!"}
{"text":"It's a small place, with a small menu, but very good food and hospitality. Nice atmosphere, definitely a step up from Khiem's which preceeded it in this location. The gai yang was delicious! I'll definitely be going back again,  regularly."}
{"text":"Pad Kee Mao, kra praow, and pad Thai were all fantastic. Super flavorful and the portions are perfect for the price. This will be our new Thai place after going through four others in and around Lakewood and RR. The kra praow is a hot basil dish, we had it with chicken, which is minced and full of flavor. The noodles in the Kee Mao were saturated with the delicious sauce-first place around here that hasn't given me dried, sticky, undercooked noodles. Highly recommend both dishes. The pad Thai was also really good. Perfectly cooked noodles and excellent flavor with the lime squeezed for a little extra juice."}
{"text":"Went there while my car was being serviced across the street and very impressed. Waitress that was there was very nice and helpful. The food was very good, will definitely be going back there!"}
{"text":"Of the three Thai places I've tried in Scottsdale (this, Malee's on Main and Swaddee Thai), this is easily the best.  I had fried tofu and a yellow curry chicken.  Both were pretty darn good.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a small storefront restaurant that I had higher expectations for and really hoped that we would like.  In the end, we found every dish was just - \"meh!\".  For takeout we ordered the following: thai egg rolls, tom yum soup, tom kha soup, pad thai (chicken), massaman curry (chicken) and kra praew (chicken) extra hot.

All the food was the same to us - just \"meh\" or just ok. Unfortunately not a single dish stood out in flavor. Ordered the kra praew extra hot and there was not the least bit of spice to it - very disappointing, especially when one says \"thai hot, please\".

You will see valid comments about finding parking, probably due to the fact that Angelo's Pizza patrons take up a good portion of what is available around there street-wise.

Overall no issues with the service and we thought the price was fair for what we received.  We just did not feel that those unique thai flavors or thai spices stood out on anything.

Would we go back - nope, I guess not.  We enjoyed the thai food from Brown Sugar or Cravings much better."}
{"text":"Best Tom yum I've ever had! When I go back I'm definitely getting the street soup soooo great! Great bubble tea and curry as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for the bubble tea, and I can't even finish the one I'm drinking right now. It's overly sweet, has way too much powder flavoring and not many bobas. Koko Bakery is where I'll stick to!

I am still curious in the food offered here and would change my review if I find out their food is good, but right now I'm pretty disappointed. I wonder if the hype they've had for their bubble tea has been from people who may not actually know what bubble tea is supposed to taste like/what the consistency is supposed to be like. Waste of $4 (which, as others said, was kind of demanded as cash/credit card was frowned upon)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant in Lakewood. This is our go to place now and we've probably tried everything on their menu. I love their pad thai, larb, kra praow, tom yum and tom kha soups. All so tasty and believe it if it says spicy- because it will be!"}
{"text":"Here for the first time with Friend Diane.  This is a Thai restaurant that is located in Lakewood, Ohio.  It does a great takeout Business !  It has only 5 small tables and a cute bar table with schools.   Very simple decor.  It's signature beverage is Bubble Tea.  Made with flavored tea and tapioca. I felt that the flavour was too artificial!  Sticky rice with mango that was delectable!"}
{"text":"Nice place- I've been here twice, once with The WIfe and once with the family.  It feels like a mom and pop kind of place.  Enjoy the chalk board menu but they really should consider putting the prices on it.  

Some things are really really good.  Pad Kee Mao- authentic, spicy and delicious. Loved it.  We were fighting for the scraps of it.  Maybe next time we'll get two.  Enjoyed both curries we tried.  A little bit skimpy on the rice- I'd encourage them to give more of it with the meals.  Mango rice for dessert- delicious and authentic.  Kinda bummed that it wasn't arranged like a rose like in the pictures that have been posted on Yelp.  Ordered it twice and neither time did it come like this.

Papaya salad was delicious.  Duck soup- wonderful.  This would stand on its own as a great dish.

Less good things?  We really didn't go for the pink soup.  Sorry, its probably very authentic but it was too sweet for my tastes.  Pad See Yeu was ok- very Chinese tasting.  It was fine, but the Pad Kee Mao was so dang delicious, it just felt like it was a waste of calories.  Larb was OK.  Don't know if I'd order it again- I've had better.  Also wasn't a huge fan of the Kra Prao either.  Bubble tea was made from a powder and tasted like it.  Some boba were too soft, others were too hard.  They didn't have the Thai Tea that I ordered :(.

They didn't have a infant/booster seat, which was surprising- hopefully they get one soon.  The waitress was friendly and polite.  I'll definitely be coming back- probably the best Thai food overall that I have had to Cleveland.  Hopefully once they get some of their growing pains figured out, it'll be easier to upgrade to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been hearing all about Thai Thai from all my foodie friends for a while now, so I had to come check this place out.  Glad I did!  This is the best Thai food I have had in Cleveland!  
I started with a Thai iced coffee, and oh my this was the best Thai iced coffee ever!  I'll definitely be coming here from now on for my iced coffee fix!  My hubby and I then ordered several appetizers, Thai egg rolls, northeast sausages, fried meatballs on a stick and gai yang.  All the appetizers were great, but our favorite was the Thai egg rolls.  I could easily eat four of these babies!  Perfectly crisp on the outside, but not greasy whatsoever!  It came with a lovely Thai chili sauce that I wish I could buy a bottle of and take home for later.  For my main course I ordered the Kra Praow with chicken because it is their most popular and highly recommended dish.  WOW this dish was wonderful!  The chicken was good quality, the vegetables were perfectly cooked, not mushy and had a nice crisp bite, and that fried egg on top is what made this dish!  I loved breaking the egg yolk and mixing everything together, such a perfect Thai dish!  Oh and it had such a wonderful punch of heat!  So if you don't like spicy don't order this dish, but if you're like me and like a little spice in your life then you must try this!
The service here was great too!  Kiwi the owner is such a sweetheart I could see us being friends lol. She was very friendly and personable I just loved chatting with her!  Overall I would highly recommend you try this restaurant!  You won't be disappointed and I'm pretty sure it will be your future go to Thai restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Service was friendly, and the food was fantastic. Cannot wait to go again.

Started with the pot stickers, and got the kra praow as a main."}
{"text":"Very happy to be able to rate five stars for their first review! We stopped by the night after they opened, not quite sure what Bangkok street food would be. They have a small but varied selection of Thai favorites as well as a few more unusual dishes and many flavors of bubble tea. The woman who took our order was very friendly and welcoming, and made us feel at home. Service was quick as well - we had our food within about 10 minutes.

While we waited for the food, I had to try the taro bubble tea. Their version was especially delicious and very creamy. For dinner I got a few small dishes to try. For a starter I had the chicken coconut Tom Kha soup, which I've had dozens of different variations of. This was by far one of the best - fragrant, rich, and savory. My main course was Som Tam, a spicy, tart, and savory salad of shredded green papaya, tomatoes, beans, and peanuts. I asked for it to be made Thai hot and they did not disappoint! This is one of my favorite southeast Asian dishes but I rarely see it on the menu, so I had to try it. I'm glad I did - this was some of the best Som Tam I can recall having had the pleasure of trying. I finished up with the sticky rice and mango which could have used a little coconut sauce but otherwise was delicious and helped put out the fire left smoldering from my extra spicy Som Tam.

My dining partner got an appetizer of potstickers (which were delicious and clearly homemade), and an order of Larb, which is a \"salad\" of ground pork, lime, cilantro, and chili. It was incredibly fragrant, bright, and savory - refreshing  but hearty at the same time. I can't recall having had anything like this before, but I'm tempted to order it for myself next time.

Overall I was extremely pleased by this cute new place. The food was excellent, the prices were very reasonable, the service was quick and friendly, and I loved the bright, modern vibe. This is definitely a place I can see myself returning to regularly. Welcome to the neighborhood, THAI THAI!"}
{"text":"Lakewood has become quite the attraction for Thai restaurants. Must be something about Madison Avenue! 

Heard about this place via Facebook and decided to give it a try. I get very picky about Thai food as I grew up eating it in our household. 

Parking can be kind of tricky due to Angelos pizza being next door. Try parking on one of the side streets for better luck.

Walked in and the restaurant was very clean and open. It's pretty small and only had a few tables. There was bar seating.... Maybe for those eating individually? I would recommend maybe just adding more tables. We were able to grab a small table and pull up a chair for our son. 

Kiwi was promptly over to our table and asked if we had any questions. My go to is always Som Tum papaya salad and gai yang (chicken). If a Thai restaurant doesn't have that, I question their authenticity. My wife ordered green curry, mild. 

Our food came and I was extremely excited for my dish. The som Tum was very flavorful. It had the perfect amount of spiciness and the heat carried after you took some bites. The gai yang chicken served as a really nice compliment to the papaya salad. You can tell it was in a great marinade and prepared very well. If you've ever been to Bangkok and has street food, this is the combo you'll find. It tasted just like in the streets of BKK.

My wife really enjoyed her green curry. It looked like the portion amount was just right for her. I was too consumed in my dish that I forgot to try hers. 

We finished with some Thai Tea bubble tea. It could've been blended a bit more, but still really delicious. 

If authentic street food is what you are looking for, Thai Thai has it. It combines many of the street vendors you'll find in Bangkok into one spot right here in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Finally found great Thai food in Cleveland! So good! We had the chicken kra praow and the shrimp pad kee mao, and Thai egg rolls.....all perfect!"}
{"text":"Really good food at an authentic spice level. The green papaya salad was great, as was the larb. I will definitely be back. 

The parking was a little difficult but you should be able to find something along nearby side streets."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was super disappointing and I'll never go back. The food was bland and overpriced. Nothing stood out at all."}
{"text":"Thai Thai is one of those family run restaurants that deliver on not only great food but also deliver genuine smiles and heart felt customer service. Every dish that I've ordered here has been nothing short of outstanding and delicious. Being a native Lakewood resident, I'm proud to add Thai Thai to my top 10 most recommended restaurants here in Lakewood, and that's saying a lot considering all the top notch offerings that are available here. If you want some great tasting Thai food with a family atmosphere then go no further than this spritely establishment!"}
{"text":"I look forward to going back to try something else. I had the pad see eiw. As others have noted, it's a bit bland, but the veggies, egg, and chicken with the noodles and add your own siracha and it gets to the right level of yum. I also had the Tom Yum soup which was excellent. I would definitely have the soup again."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times... and have gotten the Pad Thai and pot stickers each time. We've dined in twice, and carried out once. I've loved the food every time. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Very laid back atmosphere and the prices are good! Not a ton of seating space because it's a small restaurant overall, so probably not great for large groups."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, delicious. There are several Thai places in Lakewood area worth visiting, but this one may be the best. It's not so much a sit-down restaurant as it is a reliable take-out joint. Even on a Saturday night, food is always ready promptly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get Thai food. It's inexpensive and fast. You can take your food to go or just eat it in the restaurant. The staff is friendly. It's pretty clean. I have only ever gotten their pad thai. They have options of tofu, chicken or shrimp. You cannot go wrong with either of those. Also I recommend their mango bubble tea. It's basically a mango smoothie with boba."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I ordered the papaya salad along with a coconut soup and a lavender boba tea. 

The papaya salad was not bad. Hit the spot. I have had it better at other places. It had quite the kick, so be prepared if you're sensitive to spicy. 

The coconut soup was very good, the chicken was tender and spiced wonderfully.

The boba tea had a light flavor with these chewy, flavorless tapioca-like balls. Interesting. Fun to eat. I haven't had boba teas before, so I have nothing to compare them to. Constructive criticism: It would have been much more enjoyable if there was a little bit more flavor and sugar added. It seemed a little watered down and the ice was very chunky and overwhelming. Perhaps a better blender to pulverize the ice to a finer consistency.

As for atmosphere, it's a very cute little shop. I'm digging the chalkboard art. Too cute. I understand the restaurant is new and renovating/signage can be very expensive, but it would help bring people in tremendously. I had trouble finding the spot even with GPS. A catchy, large sign would be helpful. Inside of the restaurant could use new tables and chairs (as they are very old-fashioned like and diner-y). 

The service was great, quick, efficient and friendly. 

I love the concept. I would love to see this place thrive with a few adjustments."}
{"text":"I'm all about legit street food and Thai Thai brings this to Cleveland!

Really though - the spiciness level is legit (and in my opinion, totally addicting). I'm sure you could ask to tone it down if it's not your thing. Or just train yourself to handle a little more each time. 

We have had the northeast sausage which is super comforting, the kha prow shrimp rice dish (spice level legit), yen Ta fo, or pink soup with seafood. One of my favorites is the seafood dish Yum Talay!

The decor is simple and laid back with a street food style feel! Love the brick walls and chalk board too. 

I can't wait to be done with classes so I can relax and enjoy myself at Thai Thai! They'll also be at the Asian festival, night market and a bunch of other food fests, so I'm looking forward to seeing them around!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! We had a flavorful chicken green curry and also their chicken pad Thai. Reasonable prices. Only did carryout and wouldn't recommend eating there until cooler months as it is very HOT in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Loooooove this place. I see the same guy working every time I go. Many options to choose from and vegan friendly! Interiors great, service is great, food is great; overall, every aspect of Thai Thai is amazing. They also have many different flavor options for boba tea, which is why I came here in the first place (their tapioca pearls aren't the best, but it's better than mosts). Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I was hemming and hawing to go with 3 or 4 stars. I ordered the pad Thai, the coconut soup, and a taro bubble tea. I loved the soup and the bubble tea! I like taro, but was super curious how it would work as basically a milk shake. Yum. The pad Thai was ok (hence the possible 3 star). It is entirely possible that I have never had an authentic version, but I was surprised it was so pale in color. I ordered very spicy so the spice was ok (could've used more!) and it wasn't that sweet or peanutty. Again, I can only compare it to my current favs (old Mekong River in Cleveland heights and Pad Thai in Fairlawn) and current take out places (Pink Elephant and Banana Blossom). 

Separate side note. They were SO NICE there. I literally looked like a homeless person picking up my takeout bc I was so sick and it was when it snowed like crazy last weekend (hence the cold shake, hot soup, spicy stuff to clear the sinus). Not that you should judge people on appearance, but some do and they were the friendliest ever."}
{"text":"Love this place my second time eating here delicious and flavorful  food vegetarian friendly which I love ....... more of a take out restaurant then dine in not a lot of  Seats in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service! Beautifully made dishes, indoor/outdoor seating, cool fixtures and massive bar. Very clean, and especially tasty food. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai is horrible. Way to dry... way too many bean sprouts with some crushed peanut on top. I would not recommend if that is the dish you desire. Maybe other Items are okay, but I strongly recommend avoiding the pad Thai."}
{"text":"2nd time trying out Thai Thai. Ordered Pad Thai both times, 1st time I ordered it was \"ok\" but not hot whatsoever. This time I ordered it \"spicy\" and, that, it was.   I got it with the tofu and was not disappointed. It's not my favorite place to order Pad Thai from but it's good nonetheless. The green curry is solid... It doesn't come with much rice though.. My tips 
~ order to go (I don't think they gave AC)
~ ask for extra rice to go with curry
~ request Pad Thai \"spicy\" if you like any heat to your plate."}
{"text":"Came here for boba, ordered the Thai tea flavor and was left feeling disappointed. First, when you walk in you'll notice it is not the cleanest of places but we tried to overlook that as we thought we would be pleased by our drinks. The pearls in my drink were scarce and a bit too soft. The drink was not blended very well at all so some chunks of ice were kind of large. The drink is also made with a premade syrup from a jug which was surprising as this is an authentic Thai restaurant. The taste was watered down, not delicious at all. Cute interior but definitely would not come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food is amazing.  The owners are amazing, they are some of the nicest and friendliest people you could want to meet.  There were awesome at their old location on Clifton (Asian Grille) and they are awesome at the new location, too.  Don't forget to try the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Just great food. I wish there was more seating. I will eat here a lot, I can feel it."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on the other reviews I saw.  The decor inside reminds me of other Thai places nearby but with a Pinterest flair-- chalkboard wall with whimsical writing, a variety of colorful teas in Mason jars and bright plastic chairs for diners.  Thai Thai is unique in that they are touting their \"street food\" style and offer a few unique menu items.  I tried the lavender milk bubble tea and I found it to be really good, however--disclaimer: I'm a bubble tea noob.  The Pad See Ew was fine but the Pad Kee Mao was notable (if you like spicy) and I would get this entree again. I'm regretting not trying the mango sticky rice so I'll definitely be back.

I agree that parking is a real pain.  I was lucky enough to snag one of the meters out front but I could foresee difficulty with this in the future."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai street food here in a no frills cafe feel atmosphere with a  super happy and friendly owner ready to serve with smile.  The food is always consistent.  A must go to if you are into Asian cuisine.  Thai coffee is a nice treat.  You'll see things here on the menu you will not see in other Thai restairants."}
{"text":"Imma keep it real for that Thai Thai
About to skip a meal for that Thai Thai
Pocket fulla money for that Thai Thai
Slap it on the counter for that Thai Thai
I'm never tired of that Thai Thai
I'll slap yo mama for that Thai Thai
Tear up my Bangok ticket for that Thai Thai
Don't gotta fly nowhere for that Thai Thai"}
{"text":"Been here twice and we've tried the pad kee mao, chicken noodle soup, duck noodle soup, and the chicken on a stick (possibly the best thing on the menu).

Everything's been delicious and the problem are super friendly."}
{"text":"Two stars for the bubble teas. 

I came to this place for some bubble teas during my short visit to Ohio. I arrived around 4 p.m. on a Saturday and there was no one at the restaurant except the cashier. Upon ordering the jasmin and green tea bubble teas, he took the powders sitting at the counter and went to the back to make the teas. It's hard to find bubble tea shops that don't use powder, but my search continues.

The teas were okay. They were blended in ice so they were a bit like slurshies. The flavor of the teas were diluted. The bubbles were a disappointment as well. Very diluted texture, no firmness at all, which means either the bunbles have been sitting out too long, or they overcooked them. 

Well, at least it got my bubble tea craving fixed temporarily."}
{"text":"Yelp comes through again! I had cow had shrimp fried rice with vegetables. It was fantastic! Fresh and snappy shrimp."}
{"text":"YUM!!
Came here around 6PM on a Wednesday to get in a Thai fix. The interior was nothing much to write home about...a few tables and some window bar seating but pretty empty at the time so we got our choice of seats. We ordered the spring rolls and summer rolls. The spring rolls were crispy and fresh. The summer rolls had a lot of thai basil flavor which I liked and the peanut sauce was delicious.
For my entree I got the chicken pad see ew and my boyfriend got the roasted duck noodle soup. Both dishes were very full of flavor and a good portion (so much duck!).The menu had all the classic thai entrees and were reasonably priced. 
I'll have to come back here to try the crazy bubble tea drinks!! They didn't have any of the cool ones this time, but the regular flavors are always available."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite in Lakewood! The Pad see eiw and pad Thai are amazing options for vegans!  Also, grab spring rolls and fresh rolls! This place has become a staple takeout night in our vegan household."}
{"text":"Thai Thai was good! A cute little spot with limited seating and simple decor. Fast and friendly service! I tried the green curry and it was delicious. There were so many things on the menu that sounded incredible, I can't wait to go back again. Food could have been spicier for me, but I like a lot of spice. Next time I will ask for that. Also, super affordable!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a pad see ew I can devour and this is prob my most favorite in Cleveland and I' have tried a lotttttt of popular thai places. It's served hot, fresh, and THICK with the noodles, and a sauce to die for ! It's a perfect little mom and pop shop where I can hear my food being cooked in the kitchen . The food alone is a 5 in my book with my husband loving the North East Sausage almost as much as me."}
{"text":"I've actually been to Thailand so when I was having a craving for some authentic Thai food I was happy to find out there was a new restaurant in town with glowing reviews! I stopped in one evening to try a few things:

Massaman Curry: A mild sweet curry with a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg - one of my favorite curries! 
Pad Thai: They let me get this with pork and while the pork had some fatty bits to it, I still enjoyed this meal. Simple yet full of flavor. 
Som Tum Thai: Green papaya salad that was way too spicy for me. But I am sure they can tone that down if you ask. 

The woman who took my order was friendly and said she is originally from Bangkok. No bells and whistles inside, very simple with what looked like a little Thai shrine in the back to appease the spirits and some colorful framed photos for decoration. I would go here again!


**Authentic defined: \"made or done in the traditional or original way, or in a way that faithfully resembles an original\". When speaking about authentic food, even though there can be variations of a dish in its place of origin, most would agree that there are staple ingredients that follow the original recipe - like fish sauce, tamarind, palm sugar, lime wedges, rice noodles, red pepper, powdered dried shrimp, and often peanuts for pad Thai. So when you've had this dish several times in Thailand you come to expect certain smells, textures, and a balance of certain flavors, because really, this dish is not that varied in taste beside different veggies and meats added to it. Finding that back in the US (or something very close to it) is pretty great and would be considered an authentic dish since it closely resembles the way that dish is generally prepared in Thailand. 

Another example would be slapping tomatoes and pickles on a hot dog and calling it Chicago style. Nope. Some dishes have standards and hearing a place is authentic gives a person a better idea of what to expect if they have had the original, the real deal, the dish that started it all."}
{"text":"Awesome bubble tea.  Great menu.  Fast service.  Nice relaxed atmosphere.  Needed a place like this in CLE."}
{"text":"Niche place that serves authenticity Thai food. Tried the delicious chocolate unicorn bubble tea topped with a donut. Tried their most popular item Kra Praow and it was delicious. Would strongly recommend it. I really liked the idea of a traditional hand written menu. Pot sticker and green curry were good too. Two thumps up for the attentive and quick service. Go for it!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and ordered the pad Thai and egg rolls to go. Food was ready and on time when I arrived. First the good. The egg roll was delicious. Crisp and flavorful. Now the bad. The pad Thai was bland and had no flavor. I had such high hopes. The hot sauce you can get with it was the only thing that saved it. That being said, you shouldn't need to add a bunch of hot sauce to a dish in order to make it worth it. Disappointed with the flavor or lack thereof. If you go here try something other than the pad Thai"}
{"text":"So so so good! The papaya salad is spicy, but amazing!! The duck soup is also superb, and the portions are very large!

Honestly I wish I could review this place 5 stars again. I've been there 4 times now and it's always as fantastic as the first time!"}
{"text":"Came in a bit ago looking for a bubble tea while waiting on my car to be fixed nearby.  Placed my order and as I pulled out my credit card the guy working the front counter asked instead if I had cash on me with a bit of sass in his voice.  After saying that I didn't have cash, he kept an annoyed look on his face as he ran the card without saying anything else and grumpily went into the back to make the order.

When it came out 10 minutes later it was overly sweet and only had 3-5 pearls at best.  Not sure I'm ready to give this place another shot just yet due to me being such an apparent inconvenience to the guy's TV shows on his phone.  Till then, it'll be either Cravings in Rocky River or KoKo Bakery in AsiaTown for Bubble Tea!"}
{"text":"I would love to be able to write a review of the food, but we never even got that far. 

Our five-minute visit was a little concerning in that, while it was busy, the one guy who was working was more interested in his busywork than making sure we were attended to. One table was waiting to be cleared and another was waiting for its cheque. 

We walked in and were acknowledged and the worker said he would be with us in a minute. We grabbed one of the menu boards and perused the menu while we waited. About 2 minutes later, another customer walked in. The worker asked him how he could help him. The customer said he wanted to place an order to go. The worker gave him a menu board and waited to take his order. We continued to wait. 

After taking the order, the worker went back to his busywork behind the counter and left us standing in front of the counter. A minute later, a young lady came into the restaurant. The worker stopped between us and her and asked her how he could help her. Again, an order to go was requested. He went behind the counter to wait for her selection without seating us. We ended up leaving as she gave him her order. 

We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here.  I think for the ambiance and portions though the food is overpriced.  I prefer Peppermint Thai but its on the east side of town.   The Basil noodles with chicken were flavorful and so was the massaman curry but for 12-14$ a dish I'd expect a better ambiance and bigger portion size.  However, if you are in Lakewood, and craving Thai food, this is still a decent place to go.  The staff is nice.  They also serve bubble tea."}
{"text":"Not sure i agree with all the hype here. Food was ok and certainly modestly priced but lacked flavor. I had a duck soup that no amount of hot sauce could take from meh to wow. 

The seating area itself is small. Probably best to do takeout. Parking is also not easy to find.

I think that given the Thai options in Lakewood, this is \"the best.\" But this makes the journey to AsiaTown for Thai food clearly worth it.

The one thing I will say that I did enjoy was the bubble tea."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time the other day. The inside might not look the greatest, with only about 5 tables,  but they make up for it with the food. My friend and myself both got bubble teas, the Taro and Green tea, the Taro was delicious and you can't mess up green tea. We got the potstickers which were very light and garnished with fresh cilantro and peanuts and came with a ginger sauce (they didn't last long). We both ordered the Pad Thai and it was excellent, everything was fresh and very light. They also offer Shanghai STREET food option which I will be trying next.  The staff is very pleasant and willing to answer any questions."}
{"text":"We had Thai on our minds and thought we would try Thai Thai. The food was okay. The soup was amazing and I would go back just for that. We ordered a curry dish and pad Thai. The curry was delightful and the pad Thai was a bit bland. We had the spring rolls, which reminded us of the frozen ones we get from Costco. We were hoping for one of those special bubble teas but they only offer them on special days. The place was small but it works. The staff was kind and we received our food hot and fast. They had a ton of folks stopping in for take out, which is what I would do next time."}
{"text":"I was actually brought to this cozy restaurant by some friends of mine while I was visiting Cleveland, Ohio.  The restaurant is a bit small, and the parking is a bit of a challenge.  But, don't let this deter you from visiting this restaurant...they make it up with their freshly made, and delicious flavored dishes.  I honestly was impressed with their flavors of their dishes since I have recently visited Thailand and their dishes were very close to what I ate there.  I was fearing that they would be preparing watered down versions of Thai dishes to accommodate the Americans....but, that there wasn't the case.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area that loves good Thai food."}
{"text":"Visited Thai Thai a few weekend ago and ordered the Kra Praow and Pad Mee Mao. Both were delicious, and the service was perfect. We only wish the dishes we ordered were spicier, since we actively chose dishes with 3 peppers next to the name. The bubble tea is also delicious. We will be back, often hopefully!"}
{"text":"Was very good and affordable! Did  takeout Pad Thai and spring rolls on a Friday night and it seemed like it would have been super easy to get a table. Though parking is a bit of a nightmare around there."}
{"text":"Today was my second time getting carry-out from this place, and I am really pleased. I ordered the chicken Kra Praow and tofu Tom Yum. I didn't think I would finish either, but I couldn't stop eating them!"}
{"text":"i always got my Thai bubble tea from here and loved them, then all of a sudden they just got worse and worse each time i went back. the last time being given one with tapioca pearls (bubbles) that had clearly been prepared several days prior as they were completely disintegrated in my drink. i was extremely disappointed and grossed out. so unfortunately i will not be returning"}
{"text":"I have tried several pad thais in the city and theirs is by far, The Best!! Chicken on a stick was delicious. Foods outstanding! Great service too. Employees are super nice. Would love if they offered delivery. But I would order weekly so probably not a good idea lol."}
{"text":"Good food. Very bare plain interior and nothing fancy. Very good green curry. Tried my wife's food and it was good too. Lots of Chile condiment to try."}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service but most importantly delicious food made to order!!!! Just returned from Thailand and this place is legit! strongly recommend this place... The unfortunate part is that it's over 2K miles from my home!
We had the spicy Tom Yum soup with shrimp, red curry with chicken, pad see ewe  and shrimp fried rice... All delicious!"}
{"text":"Thai food lover - not overly impressed. I had noticed the 4.5 star rating a few weeks ago and had been dying to try Thai Thai out. I was seated and brought a water very quickly. The service was very good. The place is small with maybe 4-5 tables. I ordered tom yum with shrimp and green curry with chicken. Nothing I had was \"fresh\" besides the cilantro garnish on the Tom yum. The green curries chicken had the texture of slimy take out Chinese food and didn't have any bamboo. It's seems like they cut a lot of corners. The flavor and experience as a whole were ok but put next to comparable places in the area I don't understand the hype. I don't understand why this has a \"$\" when other places in Cleveland have\"$$\". Every Thai place in Cleveland has $12 dishes. I would probably go back if I lived around the corner but I won't be going out of my way to go back to Thai Thai. A for service, C for good quality."}
{"text":"I can give it two stars because the person who waited on us was very nice.  I so wanted to like the place but when considering how many other Thai places there are that seem to me to be cleaner, better value for the money, and far fresher ingredients, I don't think I could go back."}
{"text":"Thai Thai's chicken ka prow is second to none, with perfect spice levels, robust taste, & served with ground chicken, like it is in Thailand - rare to find in the U.S.! I love the taste of their pad Thai, too, though the sauce is a little goopier than I'm used to - not sure what that is, but I don't mind it, given how great it tastes. I also REALLY love their chicken potstickers. 

It's a small space that specializes in street food & does a good takeout business; if I lived closer, I have a feeling I'd be here for pickup on a regular basis. Unfortunately, dine-in is a little less pleasant: My man issue with Thai Thai is that, frankly, the service leaves a lot to be desired. Both times I've been, we've had to re-ask for things, re-order things, etc. The first time, my friend's soup didn't come out at all, & when we asked about it, we were just told that she hadn't ordered soup. OK...

I do love that the owner is so enthusiastic about creative partnerships throughout the community, pairing up with Brewnuts on a unicorn bubble tea & other fun stuff to that effect. It's great to see a local business owner who's so clearly passionate not just about her own restaurant & food but about the local community as a whole."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant by a friend who lives in Lakewood, and hailed Thai Thai as one of the best Thai restaurants in the west side.

I can't say I've been to very many Thai restaurants on the west side, but Thai Thai definitely delivers top quality food.

I like that the restaurant lives up to its hype of delivering street food, having dishes such as Gai Yang and Yen Ta Fo. Most Thai restaurants around northeast Ohio mostly just do pad thai and various colored curries, so it was awesome to see a restaurant offer something different.

I was not hungry enough to get one of the numerous famed appetizers, instead opting for a Kra Praow with a Thai coffee. I had never tried Thai coffee before, so I wanted to give it a shot. It didn't particularly stand out to me - just a fairly sweet coffee. The Kra Praow, however, was solid. Very spicy, but that didn't stop me from finishing every last bite. The basil added a lot of depth to the dish, and the rice acted as just enough of a buffer to help me tolerate the spiciness.

Definitely a must try Lakewood restaurant."}
{"text":"We are a crew from out of town here for work! Great Food and wonderful service! I would recommend coming here if you want Thai food!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food. I eat it frequently and when I find a great place, I just straight up give them all my money! (Ok. Not really. I have kids and stuff. But you get it.) THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES! 
My old Thai joint is downtown and a pain to get to, but now that I have found Thai Thai, I don't have to worry about getting to Asia Town and back in rush hour. I only have to figure out parking near Angelo's. (Haha. Lakewoodians, you feel me, I know. )
So, we started with Pad Kee Mao and Pad See Ew and the Chicken Dumplings. Wonderful! We got the Kee Mao in medium and it was perfection. Not boil-off-my-face heat which was exactly what we wanted. My 3.5 year old and myself loved the See Ew and she ate 4 of the dumplings alone. 
Because now my husband and I want to sample the whole menu, tonight we got Massaman Curry with chicken, chicken and tofu Pad Thai and the crispy Spring Rolls. Again, wonderful! His Massaman was sweet and perfect and had that little bit of heat you love from Thai food. My Pad Thai was classic, though next time I might request more green onions! The chicken and tofu were cooked perfectly. My husband had the lavendar bubble tea and LOVED IT!
All in all, insanely satisfied with their food and looking very forward to trying the rest of the menu. Make sure to sample this place soon!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wanted to love you Thai Thai. I went a little crazy and decided to order the Pad Kee Mao, papaya salad, and mango sticky rice for my lunch. The Pad Kee Mao was good. Tasty but not \"omg this is the best thing ever.\" I didn't find it spicy at all, but I ate the entire thing so clearly I liked it. I was mostly disappointed in the papaya salad. After all the raving reviews I was so excited to try it after first trying it in the streets of Chiang Mai. To me it was really bland and the papaya wasn't very crunchy. I barely ate any of it and was super upset I didn't love it. Last the mango and sticky rice. My mangoes were super dark, mushy, and stringy which kinda ruined it for me. The rice and coconut combo was great but I couldn't get over the texture of the mangoes. The man that took my order was very polite and the interior is gorgeous! 

I like this place better than the one down the street, but I'm still on the search for my Thai spot. Who knows, maybe being in Thailand ruined American Thai food for me forever.  Maybe I came on an off day- I will try again and hopefully have a better experience!"}
{"text":"The duck noodle was off the chain!  I saved some broth and asked for a second order of just noodles on my way out.  It was almost as good as leftovers :)."}
{"text":"Awesome. Was dying for pho and didn't feel like heading downtown. Someone suggested I go here for the street noodle soup. It's excellent similar to pho in style not in taste. But the flavor is great and they have every sauce you could imagine to dress it up. Simple yet awesome menu. Not a pretty place on the inside but it's the way it should be! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered hot tea, plain hot tea, all teas are pure sugar, same as tea from India,  regular green tea was advertised, and they had none, and did not change it on the board.

Ordered fresh rolls in rice paper, pass them by, made with bag salad verses fresh lettuce, no variety, iceberg lettuce verses any of the other varieties, lots of purple cabbage in the rolls, Thai receipt does not use red cabbage. 

Fried spring rolls were good, well prepared.

Pad kee Mao was good, well prepared, good quality.

Order the Larb chicken salad, was not good, used canned chicken verses fresh shredded. Boiled or baked. The Larb taste like cat food, pass it by. 

All in all, i could not recommend this restaurant for Thai. Head east a few blocks and go to the Thai Hut.  The Hut is closed on Monday's, that is why I rolled the dice and went to the Thai Thai. Bad news, if this is street food beware of street food...."}
{"text":"Tasty and Thai. I don't mean to be redundant or state the obvious but that's exactly what I'm going to do. I love Thai food and I loved this locale. 

I let the server order for me per usual at new restaurants like this and he delivered. Shrimp Pad Kee Mao. Wide rice noodles with carrots, cabbage, onions and few other tasty veggies in a thick, spicy sauce.  It really left me feeling full and satisfied. Trust level for the server +1. 

The pad Thai was light and nutty with hints of sweetness.  I enjoy how every pad Thai varies from another in different ways. If even so slightly. 

Will go back and try other dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Good Thai food! Had the green curry and drunken noodles. Both were delicious. The mango bubble tea was good too. The restaurant seems simple with a solid short menu. Want to try the papaya salad next time."}
{"text":"I knew I loved Thai food. I didn't know I loved Thai street food. It's new(for me at least)and dare I say it, it's better than any Thai food I've had before. I'm never disappointed. The Pad Thai can't be beat but don't miss the Kra Prow or Pad Kee Mao."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai Thai! It's within walking distance of my house, which I love and the food is fast and so delicious! 

My go to order is the pad kee mao and I can't bring myself to order anything else even though I want to try a lot of other things on the menu. The noodles are SO good and there is the perfect amount of spice to the dish. If you don't like spicy, I would not recommend this one. 

I have also tried the regular pad Thai and it was also very good. I'm not a huge fan of peanuts in my food but I realize that is something a lot of people go for. If you like that, then that dish is a must try! 

I love Thai Thai and will definitely continue to be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"This place is great and really gaining a following thanks to Kiwi and her delicious bubble tea creations!! I have been for several different bubble tea events over the last year and I always get a bowl of their delicious duck (noodle?) soup. I've also tried the spring rolls which are very delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Madison Ave, Thai Thai!   I picked up lunch take-out today, and it's exceptional.  I ordered the Pad Kee Mao (only veggies, no tofu) and spring rolls.  The Pad Kee Mao is delicious, and definitely spicy.  The thick rice noodles are wonderful.  The spring rolls are also delightful -- 4 small rolls with a delicious sauce.

During lunch, street parking was no issue.  They did mention that they are considering delivery since evening parking can be a challenge.

The woman working today was lovely.  She even called me when the food was ready because she wanted to be sure that it was warm when I ate it :)"}
{"text":"This place is great I like the pot stickers, and pad Thai! Bubble tea, is on point nice staff I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"In my estimation, this is the best Thai restaurant in NE Ohio, and I'm not only saying that because I went to high school with the owner.  The ingredients were extremely fresh.  The flavors were wonderful.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tiny place with a wonderful vibe and excellent food for less than expected... I actually crave their tom ka soup. They also make over-the-top bubble tea on special days... can't wait to try one!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit Thai Thai for a long, long time. They actually opened a few days after I last moved away from Cleveland and I'd been trying to make it in ever since. Lucky for me, I finally got the opportunity to do just that over the weekend. 

Right off the bat, I was thrilled with the low-key decor and upbeat, yet soothing, music selection. It's exactly what I wanted in the local restaurant - character. From that point forward, I had an absolutely wonderful experience. The owner was incredible nice and tentative. The food was fresh, flavorful, and left me wanting more. And the boba tea was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. 

Honestly, I wish I could've tried everything on the menu. It all sounds incredible and left me with visions for my next visit. I can definitely recommend the Larb, North East Sausages, Pot Stickers, and Gai Yang though - basically everything I ordered. 

I can't recommend Thai Thai enough and they've certainly earned a new customer for life. I'll be visiting them again real soon - or as soon as I can find time to fly over for another visit."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Came with a small group early Friday night. The food came out pretty quickly and service was good. Portions are on the smaller size, one entree is definitely not enough. We shared 5-6 dishes among four of us and we could've eaten more. Thai tea was good, I really liked the northeastern sausages and roast duck noodle soup."}
{"text":"Pad kee Mao is spicy and a standout. Notably less sweet dishes here than most Thai places, which is great. Always have a great friendly experience with owners/staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant close to my house! Friendly service and good food! I love to have noodle soup !! Price are perfects. I remand this place."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and came out reasonably fast. Will definitely go back.  Try the strawberry banana bubble tea it's really good"}
{"text":"I haven't tried a variety of Thai food before, but the price, quality, and customer service here is great!"}
{"text":"I came in here on sunday late afternoon to grab some lunch around the Lakewood area. I have had many thai food and have tried different thai restaurants all around northeast ohio but I wanted to try thai street food which I never had.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and a table to sit at. The dinning area has small tables and few chairs. And everything inside looked very decorative and clean. I started with thai egg rolls which comes in two pieces and the pot stickers which comes in 6 pieces. The egg rolls were crispy flavorful and soft inside. It didn't taste too greasy or oily. The pot stickers was one of my favorite. The wrapping was so soft and the meat was very tender. So far even for appetizers it was very flavorful and delicious! For my entree I ordered Kra Praow which is a hot basil fried rice dish, Pad Kee Mao which is a noodle dish, Som Tum Thai which is a fresh papaya salad and the roasted duck noodle soup. The hot basil fried rice had so many flavors and you could also choose spice level for every dish. The chicken was very good and the rice was very different and delicious. I loved the noodle dish which I choose with chicken. The rice noodle was thick and soft and the flavor in this dish with all the vegetables were incredible.  The papaya salad was very light and refreshing. It was a salad packed with flavor. It was perfect for summer time! And the roasted duck noodle soup. One word! WOW! Everything from the broth, to the noodles, to the duck, to the spice and the vegetables in it was perfect. I have had many noodle dishes but this one just blew me out of my mind! I think every street food has its own authenticity in its own culture. And they did a awesome job bringing thai street food to Lakewood! I will be back to try some more items as well as being a regular from now on. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been to some Thai places in the area and the food is bland and not too spicy. It that's not the case here. It was full of flavor and I got the medium spice and that was plenty. Very friendly waitstaff and we ever had to wait around for water which I definitely needed. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"AsiaTown has a strong draw with many different options for Asian cuisine including Thai, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese. Madison Avenue in Lakewood is turning into ThaiTown with the third and newest Thai restaurant opening up in the former Khiem's location, a block from Angelo's Pizza. I came here with a group of guys I have known since 9th grade for a wonderful family style meal. Each dish was enjoyable. The prices are right and a lot more affordable than the yuppie adjusted scale around my house in Tremont and Ohio City. I will continue making the quick drive out. It is well worth it. Like Lucero said it is only \"That much further west.\""}
{"text":"Ordered a Thai Curry, went in with heightened expectations, wasn't thrilled with the flavor of the curry. It was a decent curry, nothing to rave about, will probably not visit for the curry again. However, will give it a shot for other items."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Thai Thai they were featuring their 'galaxy bubble tea'! While I have never had bubble tea I was pleasantly surprised with the delicious fruity blend. The woman helping us was so sweet and encouraged us to follow their Instagram page to keep up with other specials and new foods. 

Thanks to the wonderful experience and amazing food I now visit Thai Thai often. There menu offers a variety of meat, vegetarian and vegan options. I always get Pad Thai and add the house hot sauce on top! Thai Thai had delicious food and great service! An affordable place to grab flavorful Thai cuisine"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pre-Valentines Day lunch. Really enjoyed the excellent service. 
We split the Yum Talay. Very tasty, advertised as spicy but it was not bad. 
I had the Roasted Duck Noodle Soup. Very hearty, lots of Duck, noodles and vegys. Outstanding. I added a few scoops of their homemade hot sauce!
My wife had the Chicken Kra Praow with rice. Great portion, full of flavor and medium spice was perfect.
Excellent lunch. Enjoyed the staff and the meal. 

Come in hungry, leave satisfied and having new friends."}
{"text":"If you're only going get one thing, get the kra praow! Can't beat delicious, basily, spicy ground chicken topped with a crispy fried egg. My next favorite thing here is the pad kee mao (drunken noodles)--sweet, spicy, loaded with veggies and satisfying and perfectly cooked rice noodles. Tom Yum soup is always solid. Love finding such an authentic Thai place in Cleveland! It's a small place with fairly limited seating, lots of people prefer to call in and order take out, but the dine-in service is still good."}
{"text":"All of the dishes that we've tried here have been really solid. Lavendar bubble tea is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've only been once but I want to try everything on the menu. It was delicious food and drink and I want to marry the spring rolls I had for an appetizer! Seems more like a to-go pick up place but there are a few tables in there. Great service too! I'll be back"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I love Thai Thai for so many reasons --their food is lovely and wonderful and their vibe is cool and different. This changed when I placed an order the other day, Saturday. My friends and I called for pick up around 6:15. We were told our food would be ready in 20 minutes. We waited 20 and then walked to Thai Thai. We entered and we're told our food wasn't ready yet. No apologizes. No please sit down. No nothing. They were not busy. Other people who had ordered after us came and left. They simply forgot to put our order in, but we received no apology. An hour after ordering, at 7:20, our food was ready. I asked if anything could be done and the girl at the counter complained about how she was the only one working and how they were \"slammed\" (they weren't). She said they simply lost our order in the shuffle. Again, no apology and I asked if anything could be done, as we had to wait an hour for our food. She said \"no.\" I was shocked. I work in customer service and would have tried everything in my power at that point to make the customer happy, simply apologizing would have been nice. Sadly, I won't be supporting this business anymore because of one rude chick. Luckily,  there's other wonderful Thai restaurants in Lakewood. Just bummed and hope no other customers have to deal with this rude customer service."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food, ive only had the pleasure of the Tom Yum Soup. It happens to be the best ive had to date. Definitely compares to that of TH. The Larb was also bursting with flavors of all sorts. 
Kiwi was very polite and made me aware they are the former owners of Asian Grill on Clifton Blvd. 
I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu, until then.... Check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"What an awesome Cleveland find! This is a little Thai place in Lakewood. I am a huge fan of Thai food and I eat quite a bit of it. This place is the real deal. REAL AUTHENTIC THAI! 

Believe it if not, in my opinion, this is hard to find. So many Thai places are like packaged SYSCO. The sauces are pre-made, the veggies are out of a bag. This is never the case at Thai Thai. Everything I have tried hear is the real deal. They have fabulous soups for cold Cleveland winters. 

This is a very small restaurant, and the decor could use some help. Please ignore that. It is about the food. This is a great little gem in Cleveland that I am willing to drive 45 minutes to eat at. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around anywhere. The other Thai restaurants in Lakewood don't even come close to this place."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out twice. 1st time, I had pad Thai. It was okay, I prefer others. 2nd time I ordered Gai Yang, spring rolls, sticky rice. Gai Yang you get one stick for $5 it is marinated and an ok portion, ok flavor, I didn't want to eat it. The spring rolls you get 4 for $4.50, they're ok, the sauce that accompanies is sweet and spicy. The sticky rice was a brick of hard rice that I had to eat like bread, I wasn't expecting that, maybe that's how it's supposed to be? I want to love this place but I didn't. Next time I'll try the bubble tea but so far there are other Thai places very close by with better chicken on stick, spring rolls with more delicious dipping sauce and tastier Pad Thai."}
{"text":"My biggest gripe about Thai restaurants is that the food is always good. It's never great, and every one is pretty much the same as the rest. 

Dare I say, this is not the case with Thai Thai. 

Thai Thai claims to specialize in Thai \"street food\" ... I can't vouch for whether that's true, but what I can tell you is that the food here actually uses different flavor combinations than every other Thai restaurant you've ever been to. I ordered one of their noodle dishes and was so pleasantly surprised by how crunchy and fresh the vegetables were and how soft and chewy the noodles are (I was later informed that they only use fresh noodles... yes!) If I had a complaint, it would be that it wasn't spicy enough despite the fact that the menu indicated it was one of the spiciest options, but I think you could request more spicy if you preferred. 

You can't miss their appetizers and drinks as well. I was disappointed that they use powder to make their bubble tea, but I found the lavender tea to actually be pretty good and not overly sweet. The northeast sausage appetizer tasted really homemade in the best possible way. 

Most of all though, this place has such a welcoming and chill vibe, my server Kiwi was one of the sweetest people. You can definitely tell this place is family owned and they are very passionate about the product they serve. I am so glad this place opened in such a prominent area on Madison and I can't wait to return, whether it be for eat-in or carry-out."}
