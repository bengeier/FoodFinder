{"text":"Had lunch here on Sunday and it was the worst service of any restaurant that I have ever been to. Ever. After 90 minutes, the server came over with some bread, with no comment on the food.  After another 20 minutes, he came by to check if we had gotten our appetizer. We had not. They proceeded to re-enter the order for the appetizer and entrees at the same time, and delivered them all at once. It was so slow that it was almost comical. Thankfully, it was a warm summer weekend and we were able to enjoy the weather with an outdoor table. And we were not in a rush. Unfortunately for Zibo, their service had been poor the first couple visits, and this ensured that I will never dine here again. Do not go here unless you have a couple hours to kill, and you are looking to find amusement in the slowest service ever."}
{"text":"Went to Zibo for lunch - ordered salmon. Specifically warned the waiter to ask the chef to make sure the salmon is not dry. However the salmon was dry and bland and came with grilled peppers and rice that tasted too strong for the fish. My second visit there and both times disappointing."}
{"text":"Resto sympathique avec superbe ambiance certains soirs de DJ. Service attentionné et professionnel. La qualité des plats est étonnante, très bons..  Je le recommande fortement!"}
{"text":"1ère fois au Zibo! de Rosemère! La carte est variée : il y en a pour tous les goûts et pour tous les prix. Le personnel était attentif et plutôt amical! Le service n'était pas guindé du tout! La nourriture est chaude et délicieuse! Le seul point négatif est que la poubelle de la salle de bain débordait."}
{"text":"Celebrating a birthday as a large group, service was amazing.  Was worried about poor service from the previous reviews.  But they took care of us, cleared the table, explained the dishes well.     I started with the Chicken Spring rolls, decent but not something to write home about.   The braised beef ravioli was much better, extremely flavorful and a good portion.  Prices are very reasonable for Griffon town.  Top grades for caring about kids and having a separate bathroom with a changing table.  Street parking is tough, you may have to pay at the over priced ALT Hotel parking lot, try finding on Peel further north."}
{"text":"Apparently being the correct demographic for this place, I recd a coupon for a free drink in the mail. Coupons are always challenging for staff to treat graciously. So a fair test for trying a new place. They failed miserably though the Rickard's white I had was nice."}
{"text":"We were staying in the hotel in the same complex as the restaurant and didn't feel like going out for dinner. So we ordered takeout from ZIBO and it was surprisingly good.  The linguine with artichokes and feta was fresh and flavourful and the penne with creamy mushroom sauce was delicious.  The order was prepared promptly too."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times from last summer to September and had their 5 - 7. I loved their 1$ oyster promotion. The promotion was available as long as you bought a drink with or without alcohol. The service was great and the environment is amazing for girlfriend dates.   I would recommend people to come here to enjoy their promos and definitely sit by their window. They also occasionally have a DJ for certain days during 5-7!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, original & tasteful!!! Staff was nice as usual and delicious meal as usual. The lounge music and the decor are very trendy & relaxing"}
{"text":"Very good food, after several visits they were able to prepare and deliver consistent meals, drinks and service.  I liked the Bloody Ceasar, Thai Salad, Zibo Salad and the gourmet Poutine."}
{"text":"Unlike other people's reviews, I really loved this place. The wait time wasn't that long and the service was excellent.   Their food was also delicious. We shared the appetizer platter at 5 people. It was 60$ for 6 different appetizers. The salmon tartare tasted great and came in a generous portion. You can also ask for more croutrons. The dessert was awesome and well made. The nutella moelleux was extremely soft and chewy. The drinks during 5-7 are cheap. The place itself was clean.   Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food are not very relevant of this resto. It seems to be overpriced for the quality. Service is a little bit long for only a few customers."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner last night, service and food were both terrible. I have been to their brossard location many times and have never been disappointed however last night was truly terrible. I will definitely not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Bouffe très bonne et variée! Prix très raisonnables. Service un peu long le vendredi midi, mais c'est normal vu le quartier (business).. A essayer!"}
{"text":"Had their fully dressed pizza. This was not good pizza. Plenty of toppings but the crust had no body. I rolled it up like a tortilla to eat it.   Pass...unless you like pizza tortillas."}
{"text":"I had one of their monster salads today - it was actually quite tasty (Thai need salad and my friend had the ahi tuna). The salad mix is a bit of everything with a bit of meat.  Not too bad but unsure about the $20+ for a salad."}
{"text":"A classic as far as I am concerned. Their menu as changed a lot since they have opened and I never have been disappointed. Am definitely a fan :)"}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner here with a friend last Friday night while staying at the Hotel Alt. It's A sleek, trendy spot with great indoor and outdoor seating, and super convenient location for hotel guests.   During our visit, we split an appetizer of wings (on the smaller side, but tasty) and a pasta dish that sounded great on paper, but unfortunately, didn't end up liking.  Our waiter was extremely understanding and quickly put in another order for a chicken burger  (which was delicious) without any trouble.   Aside from that, he was very friendly, funny, and conversational. He gave us advice on places to visit while in town and even got rid of a huge spider that showed up near our table.(Our hero!) Only wish we got his name so I could shout him out personally. :)"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience, during my last visit. And since I didn't come back to this place.  At the beginning all looked good; I was with my family, sitting indoors, behind the bar. We were enjoying our time. We ordered food, and once it came, a sudden black flies infestation came along! This was a clear sign of serious hygiene risk. We could do nothing to get rid of them, they were everywhere, all over our food... when I pointed it out to the waitress , she replied that she could do nothing about it and that's a normal situation. She advised me to contact the manager by email, which I did. When, I suggested they contact pest control services; she never replied back."}
{"text":"C'est ma première visite a un restaurant ce cette chaine. Je me tient loin de ce genre de restaurant habituellement. Mais j'ai été agréablement surpris. L'accueil fut très chaleureux et j'ai eu le choix entre la salle à manger vide ou la section bar. J'ai pris place au bar où il y avait un très beau décor et un DJ avec musique lounge. Très bon départ. Le restaurant à une belle carte de vin et un bon choix de vins au verre à prix raisonnable.  J'ai manger un hamburger Californier servi avec frites maisons servis sur une planche de bois.  Excellent burger et belle présentation. Pour dessert j'ai choisi le croustillant aux pommes.  Très bon. Fait à noter, la cafe est rarement à mon goût au restaurant. Pas frais ou pas assez fort. J'ai pris une chance et je n'ai pas été déçu. Le service de Guillaume etait professionnel et amical. Le stationnement intérieur est gratuit avec un repas complet. J'y retourne bientôt."}
{"text":"It's pricey for the quality of the food, located on the first floor of the Alt Hotel, in an industrial and still under development neighbourhood... I had the Portobello Burger, nothing spectacular, my companion had the penne, she was not impressed, neither was I. Decent customer service..out of my list"}
{"text":"I've been to this Zibo location four times because I live close by and all those times I went the service was poor. They seem to be under staff every time. The service is always so slow.  I went there for 5 a 7 for drinks and the waitress was not informative when I asked her about the drinks specials. When the bill came, some drinks were on special and some were regular price. She clearly knew we were there for the 5 a 7 drinks but chose not to tell us that some of the drinks we ordered were not on special.  On another occasion I went there I tried to order drinks at 11:30pm and the waitress said I could only order one drink because it was closing at 12am. I have never heard of something like that. There was three of us trying to order six beers and she declined probably because she was lazy and didn't want us to stay.   This location needs new management. I think giving four chances is enough for this place. Will never come back even though I live two minutes away."}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate my birthday with a few friends actually it was a pre-celebration.  First of all it took about an hour to order food and when we asked the waitress if we could have bread it took her about 15 minutes to give it to us. At some point I did think that maybe she was really busy but in retrospect if she only had two tables to serve including ours. I cannot complain about the food that we all enjoyed our meals that I would give it a four-star (3.5) if it was only for the food. Once we finish ordering coma the waitress came back to ask us if you wanted to order their special oysters which were one dollar each. We ordered a dozen and we were given 11 oysters. Then my friend ordered a second glass of wine  red wine and it was very cold?? We asked the waitress upon it because usually white wine is served cold... And she said that all their red wine was at that temperature.  Not to mention it took forever to have to bill. I have tried other succursales of this restaurant before: i will never come back nor recommand this restaurant.  This is the first 1/5 I have ever given..."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars cuz the drink Aloha Berry, aka Angel Food Cake drink. The food was pretty good but that drink is to die for, so I had 4 lol!"}
{"text":"Been there for a team lunch, the place was packed, a bit on a louder side - but cozy.  Nice menu - would've been considered \"exquisite\" elsewhere in Canada, though rather common for Quebec area. I like places like that, where you won't get bored by the same plates in a while.  Quality of food was very satisfactory, though portion size was good for those who dream losing weight. Personally I'd prefer heftier chunks of food, but that's just me.  Price wise, Zibo was neither cheap, nor a wallet killer - especially for an \"Italian\" place. I wouldn't hesitate visiting it again next time in Laval."}
{"text":"Really like this place. It has a great sophisticated vibe without being too stuffy. Very family friendly even though it seems to have a great bar area. Discovered this place several months ago while staying at the Alt Hotel.  The penne mushroom pasta is great. The pizzas are good, too.  They also have different specials like $1 oyster, ladies happy hour, Sunday family pasta nights etc., so check out their website for the location you will be going to as they vary.   What I particularly love is that they have grilled salmon and vegetables on the CHILDREN's MENU!!!  It's so hard to find healthy options for kids. Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart!"}
{"text":"Comme je travallais dans le quartier à l'époque je venais régulièrement pour leurs 5 à 7. J'ai connu ce restaurant à l'ouverture. A l'époque, le service était correcte, le gérant effectuait beaucoup de promotion pour faire découvrir l'établissement et le concept Zibo déjà connu ailleurs. Le menu est diversifié, ils ont des options très intéressantes. J'ai tout de suite aimé la poutine au canard effiloché. Leur salade asiatique était une des préférées de mes collègues, a un prix quand même conséquent, mais quand on voit la portion on comprend et on accepte. Le bé mol a toujours été le service, des serveurs souvent incompétents, lents et certains même pas sympathiques. Je suis revenue il y a deux semaines un samedi pour un anniversaire nous étions une dizaine. Malgré que le serveur était vraiment serviable, toujours un service lent. A croire qu'ils sont en sous effectif ou que les serveurs n'ont pas de formation correcte, car le resto est rarement bondé... Côté nourriture personnellement, j'ai toujours été satisfaite de mes plats. Certains sont trop chers oui mais toujours de qualité. Le serveur m'a suggéré d'essayer leur nouveau dessert le biscuit moelleux au nutella. C'était vraiment excellent. Leur cheesecake est aussi un bon choix. Pour ce qui est du plat que j'ai choisi, j'ai pris le tartare de saumon, je l'ai demandé bien assaisonné et je n'ai pas du tout été déçue."}
{"text":"I've been here before but its been a while.  I always remember the pretty girls that worked here and it seems the tradition still continues.  I ordered a California chicken sandwich, which was in fact very good. Fresh chicken breast slices with guacamole, cheese etc... I truly enjoyed it. I would go back for the food next time and not the girls. lol..."}
{"text":"Having a 5-7 with friends. Nice ambiance. The place can get crowded on Thursdays & Fridays. Small remark, the waitress is a bit slow. Came at 6:44z She made me miss my happy hour."}
