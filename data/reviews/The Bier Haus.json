{"text":"I have drove past this restaurant several times. I don't write many reviews, but thought this restaurant deserved it. Food was incredible, service was excellent.  You can tell that everything is homemade. Pretzel bread was very good and everyone was extremely happy with their meal. I had the best schnitzel that I have ever had.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really have never been disappointed. Went one time and there was a polka band playing. Lole and behold, band was great and was a pleasant surprise. 

Nice selection of beers on tap. 

Great fries!!  Great burgers. 

Don't be fooled by strip mall location."}
{"text":"My first reaction at walking into to the restaurant is that it feels like German with the decorations and general atmosphere. Incredibly friendly and helpful service. 

My date and I started with the fried pickles and it was definitely a good decision. Unbelievably delicious and a good light appetizer. For entrees my date ordered the Chicken Papirkash and I ordered the Schnitzel Patty Melt. Both were equally amazing but neither left room for dessert. 

The best part of the night was getting the bill which was an underwhelming  $38!!! Great service, amazing food, and good prices. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and sophisticated, delicious german inspired food"}
{"text":"I went to this place about a month after they opened.  I checked out their menu before hand online, and was very excited to see that they had two of my favorite dishes, chicken paprikash and potato pancakes.  There is nothing like good homemade chicken paprikash, and when I seen that they had it on the menu, I had to give this place a try!  When we arrived, the place wasn't real busy, so we were seated promptly.  The menu is limited, with only six entrees to choose from.  The prices are on the high side for the entrees, especially considering everything is a la carte, however the burgers and sandwiches are more reasonably priced.  Because the prices were so high, we skipped the salads, and just went for the entrees.  We ordered the chicken paprikash, and based on the recommendation of the waitress, the Sweet Jaugermiester Roast Pork.  When the entrees arrived, the presentation was good, but the portions were extremely small, more like a small plate then an entree.  I have no problem with smaller portions, but even America's next top model would of left this place hungry!  The food was hit or miss for me too.  While the pork dish was good, the chicken paprikash was very disappointing.  The paprikash sauce was wrong on so many levels, and the chicken on the bone looked like it came off a small bird, rather then an actual chicken.   For dessert we decided on the gelato and strudel which were both good, but not great.  For two entrees, two desserts, and two drinks, the bill came to just over fifty dollars plus tip, way to overpriced in my opinion!   

So overall I was disappointed, however one positive thing that I can say is that the burgers and fries at the other table did look really good and may be worth a try!"}
{"text":"Please read all of my comments... Based upon the name of the restaurant, I had very high expectations for great German food and beer. This place does not really offer  much of either. However, the food was outstanding, beer selection is average at best. Please adjust your expectations and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this lil gem! When we first arrived the band was very loud and we almost left, but luckily we decided to stay because we had a great time. The band was really great and a couple more drinks and you may have seen me do the polka!  Service was friendly and fast which always makes an experience all the more enjoyable. 
Their happy hour specials on Saturday night can't be beat! My friend and I ordered a pizza to share and a martini a piece and spent under 8 dollars each! We ordered the sausage flatbread pizza and it was very tasty. Not super heavy and spicy like I was expecting. It was very mild, crispy, and the ricotta cheese really complimented the dish with its creamy, delicate flavor. Tasty! It was pretty busy on a Saturday night in the suburbs so kudos to them! The locations is kind of off the beaten path, but hey they are doing pretty well from the looks of it. 
Overall, I'd say Bier haus offers great deals, a relaxing and fun atmosphere, and great service! Worth a stop and I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"Kind of a fun \"hidden gem\" here in Strongsville.  Tucked into a strip mall near the South end of town (on Pearl Road), this place has been a pleasant find.  Went recently with a large group, and they were extremely accommodating and nice to us.

To start, the server brought out orders of fresh (pretzel) breadsticks with an interesting flavored butter, which we later ended up dipping in the sauce of one of our German main dishes.

My wife and I shared two entrees...a bacon cheeseburger and the chicken (two ways) paprikash.  Truly this is one great burger with a TON of flavor and an excellent bun.  The burger had fries served on the side, which had been tossed in a herb mixture that rocked.  The chicken paprikash was tasty, but (as mentioned above) the best part was dipping the pretzel breadsticks into the sauce...delicious!

Prices might be a tad high, for the fare served, but don't let that keep you from trying this place...we need to keep these unique spots open in town, instead of all the typical chain places.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"visited recently with eight family members.  Nice interior, friendly staff and a great beer selection, both draft and bottled.  really like they support local breweries, especially with the Octoberfest brews out.  I could easily make a meal out of the pretzel bread, herbed butter and a few drafts, but there is a lot more to choose from.  really enjoyed the potato pancakes, new spin on a tradition dish and the chicken paprikash was awesome.  chicken wings were killer and the Schnitzel got good comments.  Only downside is that I asked for a side of spetzle and was served potato dumplings instead.  otherwise two thumbs up.  we will definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch!!! We will return! The omelette was great and I am a sucker for a b√©arnaise sauce, over the omelette with asparagus .... Yummy!! My husband had traditional potato pancakes with a gourmet edge. Delicious! I want to go back and try the red velvet pancakes ....ummmmm. Skip the B-Spot and drive right down the street this place, you will be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Very cute, small restaurant. Fries are delicious.
If you get a burger, get the one with bacon on it, thickest bacon I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"This was seriously some of the best food I've ever had. I highly recommend the beet salad. It's delicious. 

Their bread is soooo good as well. $4 drafts?! Wha?! Amazing!

The mac and cheese was great, the desserts were great. Wow what a great little hole in the wall place. Decor is horrible and atmosphere leaves a little bit to be desired, but the food is top notch.

(a tad expensive, but IMO worth it)"}
{"text":"You know those places you see people raving about on Yelp that you put on your list of places you just might visit but will probably never get around to because it's just a little too far to drive even though the food will probably be really good? This is one of those places.

The Bier Haus calls itself a Euro-American bistro. A bit of a complicated name for a place that's really about one thing, German home cookin'. I wonder if they were worried that if they called themselves a German bistro if they'd be overrun with laderhosen-wearing, oompah playing, transplants fresh off the plane from the Mother Land? Whatever, let's look past the name.

Our dining experience started around 6:30pm on a Tuesday. We were the first customers of the evening, no, wait. There was an older couple sitting at the bar knocking back a few drinks. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and told we could sit anywhere we wanted. Right off we get a treat, plenty of booths. We took one.

The decor is, well, functional and clean. And a word, pine. Lots and lots of pine. Pine chairs, pine tables, pine wainscoting, someone likes pine. Giant words on the wall to help people understand what it is that the Bier Haus does - BIER, FOOD, WINE. That about covers it. I really liked the line of tap handles that ran down the center of the main dining area. It was also really bright.

The beer selection is way better than I expected. Sixteen taps and not a single macrobrew to be seen. Some of the standouts: Goose Island Sofie (I know, they're owned by ABInbev) a solid farmhouse ale, the Bierhaus Lager is a tasty Munich Helles brewed by Akron's Thirsty Dog, and Jackie O's Chumolungma. Not sure what to get? They sell a $6 flight of four tasters.

The menu is full of German-inspired dishes. This means you'll find the usual schnitzels and brats but that's not where it ends. There are several surprises scattered amongst these European delights as well. 

Soft pretzels with mustard butter. We got these with our dinner. Everyone should serve soft pretzels at every meal. These were delicious, Soft in the middle, crispy on the outside, wonderful. A dozen of these and some beer and I'm set.

Warm bacon & arugula salad - Arugula, bacon, roasted radish, red onion, dressed with sweet mustard vinaigrette and topped with a poached egg and thin-sliced and toasted soft pretzel. A very tasty combination. The egg was cooked perfectly and was a great addition to the dressing. I don't get the roasted radish thing.

Pretzel crusted fried Gouda - Delicious. Balls of smoked Gouda cheese coated in crispy pretzel bits and fried. Served atop a sweet tomato jam. The drizzle of garlic aioli a nice touch. 

German pot roast club - Thin-sliced braised short rib schmeared with gravy and garlic aioli and served on a pretzel bun with house-made pickles. This may be as close to a perfect sandwich as I've had in a long time. Juicy, fatty, greasy, and who doesn't love a soft pretzel bun? The acid from the pickles helped to cut some of the heavyness and the onion rings we got instead of the fries ($2 more) were crispy, battered golden circles of joy.

Skillet grilled sausage plate - A knockwurst and a bratwurst served atop sauerkraut. The sausage is wonderful. Made fresh, in-house using Ohio pork. The snap of the casing, the spices. This is how sausage is done. The pickled asparagus and (more) roasted radishes I could have done without and the potato \"dumplings\" were more like gnocci, but still tasty. I'd have preferred some spaetzel.

Creamy coleslaw - I'm tough when it comes to cole slaw and I'm an admitted purist. I wasn't a fan of their slaw. I think it was a blue cheese base, which isn't my favorite, and it lacked seasoning and acid. I also like my slaw a bit sweeter than this. We put it on the pot roast sandwich and it seemed to work well there. We'd skip this next time.

Well, there you have it. The Bier Haus is a local eatery that's carved a niche for itself in the German comfort food market. Don't let the strip mall locale dissuade you. The service is excellent, the food tasty and the beer plentiful. Come here for the ethnic food, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very friendly place with a good draft beer selection and yummy sounding menu. This place was a welcome surprise after failing to get any service at Brew Kettle. Come here for a more relaxed craft beer experience with more refined food. 

I will be back next time I am in town and intend to order food next time. I also recommend the flight of beers if you're not sure you want to commit to a full pint."}
{"text":"The skinny: nice place and good food.

We went with another couple on a Sunday. Before the meal the server brought pretzel bread to the table - very delicious! Hard to beat the schnitzel special for $12.50 which included mashed potatoes, carrots and a beer (Spaten for me). All items were perfectly cooked. Also ordered at our table was the hamburger: properly cooked-to-order and flavorful. Nice to see a good quality bacon used too. I add that the burger cost includes french fries though that is not indicated on the menu. A nice surprise as the fries were crisp and had a hint of rosemary - very nice. Glad to see a family-owned place giving it a try. We spoke with the owners who were helping seat people and bus tables. Recommended."}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday Brunch.  Had Schnitzel Benedict and some $2 Mimosas.  Server was friendly and chef came out to table and said hello.  Very nice and passionate young man.  Will Definitely be returning for dinner."}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing a non-chain restaurant to Strongsville! My husband and I were not sure what to expect, this is in small shopping plaza and they were not very crowded. We were blown away with the flavorful entrees! They give you this yummy pretzel bread, and we had the potato pancake appetizer, although you could not taste the potato too much, they were dressed nice and presented particularly and didn't let down our palette. 

I had the Apple Butter Cod and loved it, my husband had the chicken paprikash, which looked a lot different than traditional fare. I would describe this as traditional German dishes with a modern almost fusion flare! We absolutely loved the food, the Chef is creative and partnered flavors together that were very nice on the tongue. The chicken pap almost had a smokey, bbq flavor to it, and it was a bone in chicken. Everything on the menu sounded so good it took a while to decide. Everything was flavorful and fresh. We tried 2 biers on tap, the German and the czech one and they were also delish. 

Another great thing about this place, was the atmoshphere and service. Our server, Shannon I think, was very pleasant and thoughtful and the owner even came over to ask us how everything was and told us about specials they have on Wednesday. This was above and beyond what we expected and we will be back here soon!

Prices of entrees seemed to hover around 14- 15.00 and the portions were enough but not over the top, but if you like to stuff yourself you might want to get an appetizer or dessert. We are so excited about this new addition!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous surprise!  Don't let the strip mall location fool you, The Bier Haus offers gourmet food in a casual, friendly environment.  

The fresh baked pretzel breadsticks alone are worth a visit.  My friends and I also shared perfect meals that included cheeseburgers, garlic rosemary fries, schnitzel, grilled asparagus with aioli, and smoked potato pancakes.  Everything was spot on and made me wish I had two stomachs.  

Daily specials, live music, beer on tap."}
{"text":"The Bier House definitely shocked me, and in a good way. What I thought would be an average dinner ended up exceeding my expectations. I have been here many times, and I have to say the pretzel breadsticks may be my favorite food ever. You owe it to yourself to go during dinner and try these (they come free with dinner)! Also, I've had many conversations with the owners and they are just the friendliest people, they truly put everything they have into the restaurant. 

The only negative things I have to say is the menu has a small (but delicious) selection, and the prices are a little higher than if expect. But if you're in the mood for some German food, definitely don't pass this one up!!!"}
{"text":"We visited here a few Friday night ago when they had the Dueling Pianos, and boy did we have a blast!! I went online before arriving and found out that they were offering $3 Draft beer, $5 martini's, $3 bombs and $5 flat bread pizza after 9pm. Perfect!! 

We called in around 4 pm that day to make reservations for the dueling Pianos the guy who took our reservation was professional and polite. 

Upon arrival we were greeted promptly and we're seated right up front, literally directly in front of the pianos, it was the perfect spot, no one in our view. 

Our waitor was very nice and attentive. My only complaint about the whole experience was that when I asked about the $5 martini's our waitor informed us they actually had discontinued that special,  even though it was still visible online. He offered to give me one at the discounted price,  that was ok by me. 

My date and I shared the Warm Bacon & Apple salad, it was delicious!  Not really  enough to share as a meal, but perfect little appetizer. We also got 2 of the flatbread pizzas.  The one with meatballs on it was the bomb, highly recommend giving that a try!! 

Can't say I am much impressed with the decor, although nothing specifically wrong with it. A lot of wood..Every where!  Never got that trend myself. It's clean and the staff was nice, we will definitely be going back to check out some of the Germans dishes!"}
{"text":"Very excited to have a new non-chain family owned restaurant in Strongsville! 

The Bier House Euro-American Bistro is a pub style casual dining restaurant. They have a variety of draft beers (15) and bottles (18). They only serve draft beers in pints. 

For a restaurant that is just opening they really seem to have it together. We were seated by a very friendly hostess and our server was knowledgeable about the menu even though they had just opened and were still trying new things. 

My friend and I split the garden salad ($7.95). The romaine lettuce wasn't sliced and came out whole on the plate in about 4 pieces. The lemon herb vinaigrette was homemade and delicious. The salad also had fried capers and feta cheese on it. They had a variety of other salads all about $8. 

I ordered the Bier Hause Burger - 100% angus beef, cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce, and pickle ($9.95). The burger was cooked to perfection and awesome. The frites served on the side were AWESOME! They ran out of ketchup and went out to go get it instead of telling us they didn't have it...good sign of customer service! 

The entrees ranged from $11.95-$18.45, sandwiches & wurts $9.95, and appetizers range from $7.95 - $11.95. 

I am looking forward to going back soon and trying beir-haus mac & cheese - Roasted chicken, grape tomatoes, fresh spinach, herbs in a Bier Cheese sauce.....sounds yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanting to try for awhile, drive by it a lot and tried it today.  Food tastes good but ordered the chicken paprikash and some of the chicken was undercooked.  told the waitress and she said yes it doesn't look cooked, took the pieces that looked pink away.  came back and said it's organic chicken it's supposed to look like that, yet the other pieces looked cooked and were fine.  the pieces that were \"cooked\" never returned and had to eat half a meal and paid full price for it.  overpriced for the area and you don't get that much food.  never will eat there again."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Always have great beers on tap. Would recommend to anyone that goes to Cleveland this is a must go"}
{"text":"Walleye Po-Boy was very disappointing -Beer, Band and atmosphere were great"}
{"text":"I visited on Thursday, August 9, 2012 with a group. My drink (Pink Lady) was watered down, and my burger was awful. The bun was burnt (toasted), the patty was done to well-done, even though I requested medium-well, the bacon that topped it was burnt, and the veggies that accompanied it were sparse. Instead of the expected slice of beefsteak tomato I received one tiny slice of a plum (roma) tomato. In addition, they were out of many menu items in spite of the fact that they were not at all busy."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for brunch on Sunday's - by far my favorite place to go. Their schnitzel benedict.......holy smokes, very satisfying and even fills me up until dinner. Their bacon is the super thick and chewy kind, european style. Their biscuits are extremely light as well. They have a solid Bloody Mary bar also in case the doctor calls for it. Good prices, great owners!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a casual non-chain meal. I must say that on my first visit I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much German fare. If you use the German spelling \"Bier\", own it! However, after trying the food, I have no complaints. Love that the chef puts twists on contemporary fare. Their sausages are super tasty. I've been a few times and have enjoyed my meal each time. 

I saw one review saying the place was a hole in the wall. Now I have a husband who LOVES hole in the wall establishments. I assure you. This place is no hole in the wall. It's not fancy, but definitely a clean casual place to grab dinner. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"An interesting addition to the south side of Strongsville.  It's a nice alternative to the chain restaurant options that we're surrounded by.  However, with this, I find the biggest problem the selection on the menu.  It was pretty limited, however the website shows many more options than weren't on the menu at the restaurant.  Perhaps they're new or coming soon, which would be good.  

Their food prices are a bit on the high end (for the area), however they do have happy hour twice a day with $1 off drafts (varies depending on day of week).  

Besides that, the atmosphere is nice and cozy with an 'interesting' decor.  There is a lot of 'Americana' (think rooster prints on canvas with a checkered border) that IMO needs to go.  It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the wall art and style of restaurant.  Then again, I don't think that should belong anywhere besides my crafty aunt's basement."}
{"text":"A very interesting place, this Bier Haus. 

The food was pretty decent, although I had a poutine (gravy-covered fries with cheese curds)  The curds didn't seem warm enough, and the potatoes were large jo-jo-type fries that didn't seem cooked enough.  I mentioned to the server who agreed that regular fries would be a better execution.  The other food that came to our table seemed to look nice. 

The part that was bizarre was the karaoke (Friday night).  I had assumed Bier Haus was angling for an upscale Euro-american bistro feel, but the karaoke added a very awkward twist.  I will admit, I was dragged up to the microphone by some friends, but I still don't think it fits what I would expect for this type of restaurant, and it detracted from the atmosphere more than it added."}
{"text":"Came across The Bier Haus Euro-American Bistro yesterday while driving out to Brunswick.  Took my wonderful wife there for dinner and what a wonderful surprise.  We started with the Pan Seared Potato Pancakes.  The thiness and texture lent themselves more to crepes, but the flavor was definitely potato pancakes.  These were topped with  smoked pork that was cooked in a sweet Jagermiester glaze and topped with a sweet onion relish and an Ohio maple reduction.  It melted in your mouth.  Then came the Hungarian Stuffed Pepper.  The large and I do mean large, pepper was stuffed with ground sausage and pepperonatta and topped with goat cheese.  As someone who doesn't like goat cheese, this was fantastic.  The starters ranged from $7.95 to $12.95.  But there is a Happy Hour Bar, and there are two different times each day, menu for only $5.00.

For the main course I had the Weiss-Wurst Platter.  One homemade Wiess-Wurst and one home made Brat-Wurst, both cooked to perfection.  Not dry and crispy, but tender and flavorful.  The Brat had a good amount of fennel in it that have it a very distinctive flavor.  The Weiss-Wurst had a very subtle flavor to it.  The two sausages sat atop a bed of Yukon mashed potatoes and topped with their Haus slaw and a mushroom demi-glaze.  The different flavors exploded in my mouth and were very enjoyable.  MY wife had the Bier Haus Mac and Cheese.  Not your traditional Mac and Cheese.  Made with large spatzel and I do mean large, roasted chicken, grape tomatoes, fesh spinach and a herbed Bier cheese sause.  Other than not being hot enough when it came out I will take this mac and cheese over Kraft's mac and cheese any day of the week.  Dinners range from $12.95 to $18.45.

We finished off the night with a hot Chocolate Lava cake topped with Pistachio Gellato.  Maybe next time I will just have this for dinner.

The staff was warm and friendly. The atmosphere was perfect.  On Wednesdays they have live accoustical music starting at 7:00 PM.  The levels are not overbearing. The kitchen very accomodating.  They will allow you to substitute what ever you want unlike the local chain restaurants.  The majority of the food is made from scrarch and fresh each day and they try to use as much local food as possible.  They have a very good selection of beer and wines and Wednesdays all bottles of wine and beer and 50% off.  On Sunday they have homemade Schnitzel with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, baby carrots and a 16oz Spaten Lager for only $12.50.

Carl A. thinks they are a bit on the high end of the price scale, but obvously he hasn't eaten at the Pomeroy House, Triv's, J Bella, Macaroni Grill, Shinto's, or The Longhorn.  The Bier Haus is better food and less expensive.  And yes Carl this is not your local Applebee's or TGI Friday's."}
